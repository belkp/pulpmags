uccaneers of venus

by otis adelbert kline

a powerful weird-scientific story by a master of science-fiction-a swift-moving
tale of piracy and weird monsters on another planet

foreword

wr -jrow it happened that robert
m  m grandon of earth became ruler
over reabon most populous and
mightiest empire on the planet venus is
a story in itself how he reached zoro-
via as venus is called how he came to
ascend the throne after countless daring
feats of valor how he wooed and won
vernia the lovely young torrogina of
reabon and how his friend harry
thorne adventurer of three worlds under
the name of zinlo became ruler over


olba another powerful empire of venus
-all this while intensely interesting
is not essential to your enjoyment of the
present story which concerns itself with
a weird people called the huitsenni a
buccaneering race that existed through
piratical raids in overwhelming numbers
against the civilized nations of zorovia
suffice it to say that as this story opens
we find grandon of terra firmly estab-
lished on the throne of reabon and
about to leave on his honeymoon with
the beautiful vernia the editors

vernias weapons taken from her she
was dragged to one of the pirates
boats
buccaneers of venus



chapter 

the pirates strike

he power of huitsen must be bro-
ken and broken for ever thus
spoke aardvan brawny bull-necked tor-
rogo of adonijar banging his huge fist on
the table for emphasis and causing the
kova cups to dance and rattle

  robert grandon former chicago club-
man who had fought his way to the
throne of reabon mightiest empire of
venus grimly nodded his assent as did
his two other guests ad torrogo of tyr-
hana and zinlo torrogo of olba for
the sake of privacy he had dispensed with
the formality of the throne room and re-
ceived them in the drawing-room of his
personal apartments in the imperial pal-
ace

  the furniture and decorations of this
room would have appeared exceedingly
bizarre to earthly eyes its paneled walls
were hung with strange weapons and
stranger trophies of the battlefield and
chase-the prized treasures of a soldier
and hunter the skins of marmelots
fiercest felines of the zorovian fern for-
ests and the tremendous bear-like mon-
sters known as ramphs magnificent speci-
mens all were flung on the floor a
marmelot carved from red wood and sup-
porting a round top of polished crystal
formed the table at which they sat the
chairs were cut from the same red wood
to represent kneeling giants holding the
carved scarlet cushions that formed the
seats and backs cloud-filtered sunlight
entered through two immense windows
that reached from floor to ceiling open-
ing on a private balcony which over-
looked the palace gardens

  ad of tyrhana stroked his square-cut
jet-black beard meditatively then he
turned to grandon i fear we have dis-
turbed you at a most inopportune time

he said a man about to start on a
honeymoon should not be annoyed with
affairs of state it was only after we had
learned of the latest outrage perpetrated
by the yellow pirates that aardvan and i
who were awaiting zinlos return to olba
decided to ask his romojak lotar to
bring us here in one of his swift airships

  when we heard that one of my ships
of war crippled by a storm and half
sinking was set upon by these yellow
fiends part of its crew massacred and the
rest carried off prisoners and my daugh-
ter narine taken to i know not what fate
we felt that something must be done and
done quickly

  and i heartily agree with you said
grandon the imperial navy of reabon
is at your disposal what action do you
suggest

  i felt sure you would come in with
us said ad especially after my talk
with zinlo this morning as i have pre-
viously intimated we must make our
plans in secret and carry them out as un-
obtrusively as possible the huitsenni
have spies everywhere because of their
peculiar physical characteristics they can
not do any eavesdropping among us them-
selves but they have the treasure where-
with to hire the vile traitors among our
people who will sell their honor for gain

  we should have two main objectives
to sink or capture every pirate ship that
sails the seas of zorovia and to find and
take the secret port of huitsen it is a
port of missing ships and treasure of
slaves who were once citizens of our own
and other lands a port of peril to every
man woman and child on this planet

  have you any idea where to look for
this hidden port asked grandon

  we have no definite knowledge of its
location but believe it lies somewhere
toward the south this because pirate fleets
leaving a scene of pillage have almost in-


weird tales

variably been observed to sail south-
ward

  i believe my flyers can locate it said
zinlo toying with his kova cup

  its a big world boomed the gruff
aardvan and it will take a deal of fly-
ing sailing and marching to explore it
all

  perhaps mernerum will help us sug-
gested ad

  i take it replied grandon that you
are unaware of the strained or rather
severed relations between mernerum and
reabon only this morning i ordered
diplomatic relations severed with zanaloth
of mernerum because of his affront to
my wife when she passed through his
dominions some time ago

  we can do well enough without that
dissolute old rake said zinlo but
were keeping you from that honeymoon
trip grandon i understand that your
expedition was ready to march when ad
and aardvan arrived

  well give it up grandon told them
im sure vernia wont mind

  see here ad protested we dont
want such a sacrifice only let us take a
few of your ships for the present and
some warriors and munitions in case a
landing-party is required go on your
honeymoon later when weve discov-
ered the port of peril well notify you
and let you in at the kill

  but your daughter has been stolen
every man on this planet worthy of the
name should be willing to assist in the
search

  ad sighed deeply alas he replied
i fear all search for her will be vain
she has been gone for so long now that
i can only hope to avenge her but of
course i her father shall continue to
search he arose and continued my
friends and allies we have imposed long
enough on this patient young bridegroom

im sure you will all agree with me when
i say that we dont want his help until
after the honeymoon let him lend us a
few ships and men now and well call on
him later

  those are precisely my sentiments
roared the deep-voiced aardvan also ris-
ing

  and mine echoed zinlo and so
grandon well go down and join the
group outside thats waiting to see you
off by the way whither are you bound
it was a toss-up whether to go to the
wild mountain fastnesses of uxpo or en-
joy the bathing fishing and boating on the
azpok coast but the seashore won and
we chose a camping-place on a wild and
unfrequented part of the coast
splendid see you outside

  a half-hour later speeded by their
many friends and by an immense multi-
tude that had lined the streets of reabon
to see them off grandon and his charm-
ing young bride vernia princess of rea-
bon stepped into the waiting one-
wheeled motor vehicle and with their
guard of fighting traveks left for the
coast

in the imperial tent of scarlet silk
decked with cloth-of-gold insignia aed
edged with golden fringe grandon
opened his eyes as the first faint dawn-
light appeared for he had planned an
early morning fishing-trip he arose and
dressed silently so as not to disturb the
slumber of his bride but she heard the
slight clank of his sword as he was about
to step through the doorway and wak-
ened

  bob

  he turned as she softly pronounced the
name by which he had been known to his
friends on earth the name he had taught
her to call him and which he loved to
hear her say with her quaint reabonian
accent
buccaneers of venus



  with three steps he was at her bedside
she smiled up at him the pink and white
oval of her face framed in the wealth of
golden ringlets that all but concealed her
silken pillow then she held up both
arms

  would you leave without kissing me
good-bye she asked reproachfully

  contritely he knelt beside the bed and
took her in his arms

  i didnt want to disturb your morn-
ing sleep sweetheart he said and add-
ed i was only going out for a little
while to have a try at a killer norgal im
told they bite best at daybreak

  she took his face between her palms
drew it down to hers their lips met

  never leave me she said without
kissing me good-bye who knows how
long any separation may be even though
we may expect to be parted for but a few
moments the hand of providence may
intervene and separate us for a long time
-perhaps for eternity

  he buried his face in the soft curve of
her neck as she ran her fingers through
his crisp black curls nor did he dream
as he held her thus for a few moments
how soon the dire prophecy in her words
was to be fulfilled

  ill be back in a jiffy little bride of
mine he said as he stood erect a few
moments later

  she watched him love and pride in her
eyes as he strode through the door her
tall handsome husband brave strong
gentle and an emperor every inch of
him

  throwing a shimmering diaphanous
wrap of scarlet material around her she
went to the door of the tent to watch him
depart two guards saluted stiffly as she
appeared they were members of a com-
pany of grandons crack troops the fight-
ing traveks from uxpo they were

armed with torks scarbos and long-
bladed spears

  vernia watched him as he stood beside
his small fishing-boat for a few moments
in earnest conversation with huba mo-
jak or captain of the company of traveks
who were guarding the camp while six
men stood on each side of the little craft
holding her nose into the breakers in
the prow of the boat was kantar the
gunner carefully shielding his mattork
-a weapon resembling a tork but of con-
siderably heavier caliber and longer range
and mounted on a tripod-from the spray
that was breaking over the bow by hold-
ing a waterproof silk cover over it

  the other members of the crew were
six rowers a man who had charge of the
sail and another who held the tiller

  having finished his conversation with
huba grandon leaped into the craft and
the twelve men who were standing in
the water launched her when they
reached water up to their necks they let
go and the rowers plied their oars vigor-
ously presently the sail went up and
the little boat tacked into the breeze
which was just lively enough to stir the
fog that hung low over the surface of
the azpok

the princess watched the boat until
the mists had swallowed it up then
turned and re-entered her tent but
scarcely it seemed had she crept once
more beneath her warm covers and
closed her eyes in sleep ere there sounded
outside the crack of a mattork the shouts
of men and the clank of weapons fol-
lowed by a fusillade of shots that told her
the camp was being attacked by a con-
siderable body  of armed men

  jumping out of bed vernia called to
the guard outside

  	rapid-fire weapons that shoot needle-like glass
projectiles by moans of compressed charges of a
highly explosive gas ignited by an electric spark

 	cutting and thrusting weapons with basket hilts
 and blades curved like those of simitars


weird tales

  what is it she asked what has
happened

  pirates your majesty replied the
guard excitedly we are attacked by the
raiders of the coast

  she dressed as swiftly as possible
buckling the jeweled belt which held her
small tork and scarbo around her slender
waist meanwhile the sounds of fight-
ing drew closer and closer to the scarlet
tent

  as soon as she was dressed vernia
drew her scarbo and stepped fearlessly
from the tent descended from a thou-
sand fighting torrogos or emperors of
reabon and as great a general as any of
them she was fully as brave as her
mighty husband even though she lacked
his strength and uncanny skill in swords-
manship with flashing eyes she surveyed
the scene before her tugging at their
anchors less than a quarter of a mile
from land were a score of vessels which
she instantly recognized from pictures she
had seen as the ships of the dreaded yel-
low pirates the scourge of the azpok
ocean their peculiar sails branching
out on either side of the mast like the
wings of bats instantly identified them
and coming rapidly shoreward were no
less than fifty boats loaded with armed
men each mounting a mattork in the bow
but this was not all for converging on
the camp from both sides and the rear
was an immense horde of yelling shoot-
ing pirates already more than a third
of the fighting traveks had fallen and
the tork and mattork fire from all direc-
tions was rapidly decimating the ranks of
those who remained

  a dozen of the boats were sent down
by hubas mattork gunners before the
landing-party reached the shore as their
prows grounded the remaining pirates
leaped out and charged the camp it was

a signal for a general advance from all
directions

  the camp had been guarded by tw
hundred men but by the time the charge
commenced the terrific tork and mattork
fire had cut them down to about forty
they formed a hollow square around the
princess and met the shock of the attack
with a fierce resistance worthy of the tra-
ditions of the fighting traveks though it
was obvious from the beginning that
there could be but one outcome

  in the hand-to-hand fighting that fol-
lowed there was no report of tork or
mattork-only the clash of blades the
war-cries of the fighters the groans of the
wounded and the shrieks of the dying
vernia and huba fought bravely with
the others time and again leaping into
the gaps left by fallen men until the line
could be closed but they were waging a
hopeless fight presently there were only
the princess and the mojak left fighting
back to back the latter battling three
pirates at once was suddenly cut down
by a blow from one of his adversaries
leaving vernia alone then a man leaped
in from behind pinioning her arms and
her weapons were quickly taken from her

  the looting of the camp was already
in progress as she was dragged kicking
and struggling into one of the pirate
boats everything in the camp except the
bodies of the fallen traveks was quickly
loaded into the boats even these were
stripped of their clothing weapons and
accouterments the pirates also took with
them all of their own dead and wounded

rowed to the largest of the pirate ves-
 sels vernia was carried aboard and
taken before an officer whose insignia
proclaimed him romojak or commander
of the fleet like most of the other men
of his race he was short scarcely taller
than the princess herself but with an ex-
ceptionally long body and arms his
buccaneers of venus



round yellow face was seamed and
wrinkled and his equally round eyes
wide open and staring were without irises
the pupils were perpendicular slits that
opened and closed like those of felines
his short nose resembled the tip of a
pigs snout and there were no teeth in
the chinless mouth beneath it from the
comers of which drooled saliva reddened
by the juice of the kerra the spores of
a narcotic fungoid growth chewed almost
incessantly by the yellow pirates nor
was there a sign of beard eyebrows or
hair on the face or head the skin of his
body being covered with a greasy exuda-
tion evidently natures protection for
these totally hairless people judged by
the standards of his hairless toothless
race he was probably not unhandsome
but to vernia facing him as his prisoner
he was a hideous monstrosity

   i presume you are the torroga of
reabon he said in patoa with the
peculiar pronunciation that a lack of teeth
induces

  you have already presumed too
much replied vernia spiritedly for
this days work i can promise you anni-
hilation of the yellow pirates

   the gums of the romojak showed in a
toothless grin he expectorated a red
stream of kerra juice then turned to a
short bow-legged pot-bellied mojak who
stood beside him

  you hear that san thoy he
mouthed sneeringly i thid yet ro-
mojak of the navies of huitsen have pre-
sumed too much

   the mojak duplicated his kerra-stained
grin

   the huitsenni never presume too
much he replied

   well said san thoy approved the
romojak then he addressed vernia once
more your majesty the huitsenni pre-
sume often but never too much have

they ever been beaten in battle has one
of them ever been led to your court a
prisoner have their cities ever been
found by pursuing battle fleets your
majesty is aware that history can answer
but one word to these questions and that
word is no

   there is only one reason why it must
be so answered replied vernia cow-
ardice you never attack unless your
overwhelming numbers assure you of vic-
tory for this reason you never lose bat-
tles or prisoners your cities have not
been found because you are adepts at
flight from an enemy in this there is
nothing of which to be proud

   your majesty calls it cowardice
said thid yet but we of the huitsenni
have a better word we call it clever-
ness however i am not here to bandy
words with you nor dispute terms you
are my prisoner captured not for myself
but for another if you are reasonably
docile and do not attempt to escape you
will be treated with gentleness and cour-
tesy if not-whatever misfortune befalls
will be upon your own head he turned
to the greasy pot-bellied mojak beside
him take her to her cabin san thoy

pursuit

far out into the morning mists that
shrouded the surface of the blue-gray
azpok grandon sailed in search of the
largest and most ferocious of all zoro-
vian game fish-the killer-norgal fish-
ing for the norgal was royal sport indeed
and fraught with great danger to the fish-
erman hunting a full-grown man-eating
tiger with a lariat could be no more dan-
gerous and as often as not the man who
lacked skill fell a prey to the fish

   grandon had never seen a killer-norgal
and so when he felt a sharp tug at his
trolling-line and a magnificent specimen


weird tales

broke water leaping high in the air and
shaking its head to dislodge the hook he
had one of the greatest thrills that had
ever come to him intrepid adventurer
though he was its body covered with
glistening blue scales and bristling with
sharp spines was about twenty-five feet
in length its enormous jaws when dis-
tended revealed row upon row of sharp
back-curved teeth in a maw large enough
to take in a dozen men at a single snap

  kantar the gunner jerked the oily
cover from his mattork but before he
could bring it to bear on the huge fish
it dived out of sight

  grandon kept a taut line on his quarry
while the crew skilfully maneuvered the
little craft to follow its eccentric and ex-
ceedingly swift motions as it dragged the
boat farther and farther out to sea after
more than an hour of this the struggles
of the monster became slower showing
that it was beginning to tire during all
this time it did not once expose itself to
the deadly aim of the watchful kantar

  suddenly without warning the line
slackened and although grandon reeled
in with all his might he was unable to
pull it taut he thought the fish had
become unhooked at first but the flash
of a dorsal fin for  moment visible above
the waves and coming swiftly toward the
boat showed him the true situation kan-
tars mattork spoke and the fin disap-
peared but it was not evident whether
he had registered a hit

  one of the older sailors an experi-
enced norgal fisherman said

  beware majesty the killer is about
to strike

  dropping his tackle grandon seized
an eighteen-foot lance which lay along
the gunwale beside him and poised it ex-
pectantly he had not long to wait for
the enormous jaws suddenly emerged

from the water not ten feet from him he
plunged the keen point down the cavern-
ous maw and kantars mattork spoke
again and again while the mighty jaws
ground the thick shaft of tough serali
wood into splinters hurling the useless
butt from him grandon whipped out his
sword but he sheathed it again as with
a few convulsive flops the great spiny
body turned over and floated belly up
the blood which poured out through one
of the gills showed that the lance-point
had found the heart and several round
holes through the head attested the marks-
manship of kantar

  the sailors were making the prize fast
chattering and laughing the while when
the keen-eared kantar suddenly said
hark i hear shooting

  every voice was instantly hushed and
there came distinctly now from the
north the sounds of a terrific bombard-
ment

  the camp is attacked cried an old
sailor

  to the oars ordered grandon and
crowd on all sail at once cut that fish
loose we must get there as soon as pos-
sible

  the huge spiny carcass was cast adrift
and sails and oars were speedily put into
use yet it seemed to grandon that the
swift little boat which fairly leaped over
the waves under this double propulsion
moved with snail-like slowness

before they had gotten half-way back
to camp the sounds of firing ceased
and grandon goaded by horrible fears
for vernias safety fumed and fretted at
his inability to make better speed or to
see through the mists that made about
two hundred yards the limit of visibility

  but when the prow of the little boat
grounded on the beach and leaping out
grandon discovered the bloody shambles
buccaneers of venus



that had been his camp strewn with the
naked bodies of his brave traveks his
grief and anger knew no bounds

  all dead he said to kantar who
stood respectfully beside him my noble
traveks slaughtered and vernia stolen
who can have done this horrid deed
and what motive reabon is at peace
with all nations the camp was not rich
in loot

  there is zanaloth of mernerum re-
plied kantar you have severed diplo-
matic relations with him perhaps this is
his answer

   if zanaloth has done this thing said
grandon he shall have war and that
speedily-such a war as this planet has
never seen i will wipe mernerum off the
face of the globe nor will zanaloth live
long to gloat over his evil deeds but it
can not be zanaloth the fact that he
once affronted the princess of reabon
when she passed through his country
made it imperative that i sever diplomatic
relations until full apology had been
made i might have declared war but did
not zanaloth should be thankful for
this as the armies of reabon could crush
a dozen mernerums

  walking among his dead traveks and
sorrowfully murmuring the names of
those he recognized grandon presently
found his mojak

  my faithful friend he said sadly
huba comrade of many a battle and
bivouac he knelt and laid his hand on
the blood-smeared brow of the young offi-
cer why his head is warm he ex-
claimed perhaps a spark of life re-
mains fetch water and a flask of kova
quickly kantar

the gunner sped away to the boat he
brought back a flask of the aromatic and
stimulating kova from the provision bas-
ket and a bailing-scoop of sea-water
there was a huge gash in the fallen

mojaks scalp and the entire upper part
of his face was covered with blood with
hands as gentle as those of a woman
grandon bathed away the blood then
as the eyelids of his young friend flick-
ered he raised the head and held the
flask of kova to the mouth forcing a small
quantity of the liquid between the
clenched teeth

  huba swallowed convulsively opened
his eyes and looked at grandon with dull
wonder in his gaze

  you majesty he said weakly i
thought i had been taken to the bosom
of thorth

  you came near it replied grandon
but the scarbo cut was a glancing one
where is my wife

  the cursed huitsenni attacked the
camp answered huba my valiant tra-
veks fought well but were cut down to
the last man her majesty fought with
us when all had been killed around us
she and i fought the greasy yellow horde
back to back then i was cut down and
knew no more what a brave little thing
she is he sank back exhausted

  then those yellow fiends have her
said grandon their spies have worked
swiftly it seems and they were swift at
reprisal where have they taken her
how can i follow

  i do not know replied huba nor
do i believe any one does other than the
pirates themselves they raid the coasts
or attack merchant or fishing-ships then
disappear as they always attack with
immensely superior forces they are never
defeated they always carry away their
own dead and wounded and take care that
none of their victims are left alive to tell
of their dastardly work but a few times
men who have been left for dead have re-
vived even as i was revived and thus
some description of them and their deeds
has from time to time reached dvijjaa


weird tales

tion fleets of the great nations have
scoured the seas looking for their ships
and their strongholds but have found
neither like the winds of heaven no
one knows whence they come or where
they go

  ill find vernia if i have to search
every inch of this planet said grandon

  one thing only i recall which may be
of assistance majesty said huba un-
fortunately i was unable to see the pirates
leave but every intended victim who has
ever escaped them has reported that they
sailed southward

  grandon turned to the mo jo of the boat
crew

  remove all but two pairs of oars he
said and prepare to push off i will sail
southward one man only will i take
with me who would be the man

  from the wounded huba to the last of
the seamen all volunteered after some
deliberation grandon selected kantar
the gunner as his companion

  you will be needed in reabon he
told huba go at once to the capital
tell vordeen to mobilize the army and
double the coast guard and the guard on
the mernerum border tell him also to
divide our war fleet into such sized squad-
rons as he deems advisable and assign
patrol zones to each squadron so that no
part of the azpok ocean nor any of its
shore line will be left unsearched have
these patrol fleets search every ship en-
countered except those of tyrhard adon-
ijor and olba farewell

  the seamen echoed hubas cry of
farewell majesty as grandon leaped
into the boat and seized the tiller kantar
already at the oars struck out swiftly as
soon as the men who shoved them off
had got beyond their depth and a little
later the two raised the sail and tacked
into the breeze which had grown con-
siderably stronger the fog too was

rising so that visibility became almost
normal

for most of the morning they zig-
zagged southward but presently the
wind veered around eliminating the
necessity for tacking and greatly accel-
erating their progress

  at noon each took a turn at the tiller
while the other ate his frugal lunch of
dried mushrooms and smoked frella meat
washed down with drafts of kova

  kantar had just finished his lunch and
was closing the watertight container when
with an exclamation of surprize he sud-
denly leaned over the gunwale and
scooped something from the surface of
the water with his hand it was an empty
half of a spore pod red inside and black
outside

  what have you there asked gran-
don

  a kerra pod replied the gunner
  and what pray is that

  the kerra majesty replied the gun-
ner is chewed almost universally by the
toothless yellow pirates where there are
kerra spore pods one may be sure the
huitsenni have been it is said that they
are never willingly without a supply of
this habit-forming narcotic which they
constantly mumble except when eating or
sleeping i therefore infer from finding
this kerra pod that we are on the right
trail-that the huitsenni have passed this
way not so long since

  and do you think there is a possibility
of our overtaking them today

   i believe sire that there is this lit-
tle boat is one of the fleetest on the azpok
-and much swifter than the large ships
of war used by the pirates in their raids
they had not been long away from camp
when we arrived so i look for their
appearance on the horizon some time this
buccaneers of venus



afternoon if they consistently follow their
southward course

  that afternoon grandon constantly
strained his eyes toward the south but saw
only such marine monsters of the azpok
as rose to the top from time to time or
flew above its surface there was a great
variety of web-winged reptiles of divers
shapes and colors some as small as sea-
gulls and other kinds and species up to
the enormous ormf whose wing-spread
was fully fifty feet from tip to tip and
whose great saw-toothed beak with a
pelican-like pouch beneath it was large
enough to take in a full-grown man at a
single snap there was also a great pro-
fusion of large white birds with hooked
bills and red-tipped wings which like
the flying reptiles dipped to the surface
of the water from time to time for their
prey or dived beneath it emerging there-
from with squirming wriggling fish or
other marine inhabitants in their beaks

   one huge ormf circled above the little
craft for several hours and kantar pre-
pared to use his mattork in case of attack
but the monster evidently decided that
the creatures in the boat were too danger-
ous for it to assail and soared lazily away

   although they did not sight the ships
of the pirates that afternoon grandon
was encouraged by seeing from time to
time empty kerra pods on the water
which indicated that they were on the
right trail

   the ships of the accursed huitsenni
said kantar as darkness fell must be
swifter than i thought or we should have
sighted them ere this

  scarcely had he spoken ere there was
a sparkle of dancing lights just above
the southern horizon

   i see lights to the south said gran-
don what are they

  the ships of huitsen replied kan-
tar excitedly those are their mast-

lights we will overtake them shortly

now

  and can you tell which is the flag-
ship asked grandon it will prob-
ably be on the ship of the leader that her
majesty is confined

   i will be able to tell which is the flag-
ship when we get closer replied kan-
tar by her lights

  good as soon as you can do so steer
for the flagship make no noise and per-
haps we can get aboard without being

seen if we can do that-

  his speech was sddenly interrupted
by a terrific shock as the little boat
traveling through the inky darkness in
which naught was visible except the danc-
ing mast lights of the pirates suddenly
rammed a huge solid object throwing
both men into the bottom of the boat

  the impact was followed by a terrific
roar and the front end of the fishing-
boat was lifted out of the water as easily
as if it had been a floating chip while
grandon and kantar unable even to see
what they had struck clung to such solid
objects as they could grasp and breathless-
ly awaited the next move of the unseen
monster

chapter 

the cunning of san thoy

as san thoy led vernia to the cabin
l which had been assigned to her his
great round eyes with their cat-like
pupils appraised her in a manner that
made her fearful

  beauteous white princess he said
when they were out of earshot of thid
yet and the group of pirates surround-
ing him you are surrounded by enemies
yet san thoy would be your friend
weighing his look and words for a
moment vernia asked

  just what do you mean


weird tales

  the slit pupils of his eyes narrowed
and this did not escape the observation
of the princess as he replied

  i mean what i say majesty in all sin-
cerity for the great respect and admira-
tion i bear his majesty your husband i
would befriend you

  you know my husband

  only through the echoes of his mighty
exploits which have penetrated even to
huitsen he replied but one brave
man admires another and feels a certain
kinship with him for his sake as well
as for your own i would be of assistance
to you

  in what way

  if you will give me your full trust
and co-operation i can help you to escape
if not you will shortly be sold into
slavery to a human monster whose mis-
treatment of the women who fall into his
lascivious clutches has made him notorious
throughout the length and breadth of
zorovia

  who

  i am under orders not to divulge his
name but we of the huitsenni were
offered an enormous sum in treasure and
slaves for your safe delivery to him it
was for this reason and no other that our
rogo decided to brave the anger of the
mighty fighter who is your husband and
send a fleet to capture you at the wild and
lonely spot where the spies of this
licentious potentate had ascertained that
you were but indifferently guarded

  it seems strange said vernia that
this dissolute monarch whose name i
believe i can guess did not send his own
ruffians instead of employing the huit-
senni

  he feared the power of reabon re-
plied san thoy any evidence which
his own men might have left as to their
presence on reabonian soil would have
led to war and the inevitable dissolution

of his empire for who can stand against
the mighty hosts of reabon but who
could criticize his perfectly legal action
were he to buy a beautiful white slave-
girl from the huitsenni and even
though she should maintain that she were
the torroga of reabon what weight has
the word of a slave a thousand beauti-
ful slave-girls might make the same as-
sertion for their own advantage and ad-
vancement and he would be legally
privileged to disbelieve them the man
who ordered your capture majesty is as
clever as he is lecherous

  vernia who was familiar with the in-
ternational laws of venus knew full well
that no man could be held responsible
under those laws for purchasing a slave
she knew also that it would be difficult
to establish the fact in an international
court that he was cognizant of the iden-
tity of that slave whose word would have
no legal weight and could be doubted by
him with impunity

   just what she asked is your price
my price is but a trifle he re-
sponded in fact it is scarcely worth
mentioning

  name it

   i should prefer to rescue you first
they were standing before the door of
the cabin to which he had led her and
which he had not yet unlocked both sud-
denly saw thid yet romojak of the
fleet rounding a curve in the deck and
coming swiftly toward them

  quickly unlocking the door san thoy
said

  the romojak comes go into your
cabin and i will call later

vernia stepped into a tiny cabin
which contained a sleeping-shelf that
projected from the wall like the nest of a
cave swallow a small table and a stool
both fastened to the floor a ewer and
buccaneers of venus



a small bowl for washing were set in a
niche in the wall

   as the door closed and the lock clicked
behind her she heard the approaching
thid yet say

  by what devious route did you take
the prisoner to her cabin san thoy that
she but entered it now

   i stood and talked to her for a mo-
ment to cheer her replied san thoy
humbly

  to cheer her ha so this little
beauty has aroused your libidinous fancy
but it was to be expected understand
me once and for all this is no common
slave-girl san thoy her ransom is the
price of a mighty empire and she must
be delivered unharmed let me but sus-
pect you and you shall die-very slowly
and very painfully-mojak though you
be

  you misapprehend excellency pro-
tested san thoy because i have spent
my hard-earned treasure for a few slave-
girls in the past i pray you misjudge not
my intentions toward this one i was
moved to pity for her that was all

  you pity pah into your cabin with
you and lay our course that we may
reach huitsen as soon as possible and
do not forget my warning

   a moment later vernia heard the door
of the cabin which was next to hers
slam with quite unnecessary violence and
after laving her face and hands with
scented water from the ewer she lay down
on her sleeping-shelf to rest and to over-
come the giddiness which the rocking of
the ship was beginning to induce but
bad as were the qualms of seasickness
they were as nothing compared to her
mental anguish for she felt that only a
miracle could save her although she had
never been deceived by san thoys pro-
testations of friendship she had been half
ready to believe that an offer of treasure

might win his help but the words of
the romojak had thoroughly dissipated
even that slim hope

   san thoy himself brought her food and
a bowl of kova late that afternoon be-
cause of her seasickness she could not eat
the food but drank the hot steaming
kova shortly thereafter she began to feel
unaccountably drowsy and soon fell into
a deep sleep

  when she awakened vernia felt the
craft beneath her lurching and pitching
violently she put out a hand for the
light-switch but there was none instead
her hand touched the wet gunwale of a
small boat in the bottom of which she
was lying she sat up and the salt spray
sprinkled her face far away she saw a
number of mast-lights twinkling a
short bulky figure loomed between her
and them in the darkness

  who are you she asked in terror
where are you taking me

   have no fear majesty mouthed the
figure san thoy your slave has res-
cued you

  you drugged me

  for your own sake majesty you
might otherwise have made an outcry
when i came to carry you off thus arous-
ing the ship and defeating your rescue
and you will take me back to reabon
at once

  in the morning tonight we must
seek shelter the surface of the azpok
swarms with fierce and mighty monsters
which by day seek their dark lairs in the
oceans depths night travel in a small
boat is extremely dangerous hark i
hear the breakers now the island is not
far off

   steering entirely by the sounds that
came to him-for nothing was visible in
the pitchy blackness-san thoy brought
the little sailboat through booming break-
ers which evidently covered a bar or


weird tales

sunken reef and into comparatively calm
water it was not long after that the
keel rasped on a gravelly shore

  leaping into the shallow water the
pirate dragged the boat high up on the
beach then he furled the sail and
taking vernia by the hand said

  come i will take you to a place
where you may safely spend the night in
the morning i will call for you and take
you to reabon

  you will be well rewarded replied
vernia i will double the ransom which
was offered for me and add to it a thou-
sand kantols of land and the purple
for life

  your majesty is generous said san
thoy but then i have cut myself off
from my own people property and posi-
tion to effect your rescue

  he led her up a narrow winding path
where leaves dripping with the night
dew brushed her face and body pres-
ently they came to a small clearing

  san thoy fumbled with a latch for a
moment then opened a door he re-
leased vernias hand and struck a light
using a small flame-maker he carried
with this he lighted a torch that hung
from a bracket on the wall and vernia
saw that they were in a tiny cabin which
contained a sleeping-shelf a crude table
three chairs some utensils and a cooking-
place beside which fuel was piled

  your slave will light the fire for you
that you may dry your clothing said san
thoy and that he may brew kova

vernia seated herself on one of the
chairs and watched his broad greasy
back as the pirate squatted before the
fire when he had it blazing he took a
kettle and went outside for water into
this he dropped some kova roots which
he found on a shelf beside the fireplace

   the title and position of a nobleman

and soon had it boiling as vernia
watched him she wondered if his inten-
tions were as magnanimous as he pre-
tended or if he were as perfidious as the
words of his commander implied so
far his impassive features had betrayed
nothing only time would tell

  presently he placed a chair for her be-
fore the fire that she might dry her cloth-
ing and poured her a bowl of steaming
kova while she slowly sipped the hot
stimulating beverage he tossed off bowi
after bowl until the pot was empty and
another had been set to brewing and she
noticed that with each bowl the feline slits
in his round eyes became more bestial
san thoy was getting drunk

  when the second pot of kova was
ready the pirate offered to refill vernias
bowl but she declined he leered a little
as he refilled his own and it was not long
before the second pot had gone the way
of the first then san thoy extracted a
kerra pod from his belt pouch and break-
ing it open emptied the red contents into
his toothless mouth

  for a while he mumbled the drug ex-
pectorating thin streams of scarlet juice
into the fire from time to time and mut-
tering drunkenly to himself as they hissed
among the hot embers

  presently he arose and unclasping his
belt which held his tork scarbo and
knife hung it on a peg on the wall then
he stretched his arms and yawned hid-
eously the red juice trickling from the
corners of his flabby mouth and staining-
his greasy chin

  my dear he said thickly it is time
to retire may your humble slave assist
you to disrobe

  with this he lurched unsteadily toward
her

  panic-stricken vernia jumped up and
placed the chair between herself and the
advancing pirate

                         w t-
buccaneers of venus

  back she said go back dont
you dare touch me

   there there he said still advancing
dont be frightened san thoy wont
hurt you

  only the chair and two feet of space
separated them now suddenly seizing
the chair he hurled it to one side and
flung out both arms to grasp her she
leaped back and his arms embraced
empty air but now she was cornered
she looked longingly at the weapons
hanging on the peg but between her and
them was san thoy

  half crouching arms spread he ad-
vanced toward her suddenly he sprang
like a beast of prey then like crushing
bands of steel his greasy arms encircled
her his grinning lecherous features
were close to hers leering down at her

  little she-marmelot he said think
you that you can resist san thoy who
has subdued a thousand slave-girls

   she struggled desperately striking and
clawing at the bestial face squirming and
kicking with all her strength but to no
avail

  with a laugh of exultation he picked
her up and carrying her to the sleeping-
shelf flung her down upon it

chapter 

a treacherous shoal

the monster with which grandons
fishing-boat had collided in the dark-
ness was evidently not of the belligerent
type for it submerged nearly swamping
them before they attained an even keel
once more

  but they were not yet out of danger
for kantar the gunner suddenly called
to grandon that the boat had sprung a
leak as a result of the collision and was
ailing rapidly

  then steer for the ship in the center
of the squadron and let us hope that its
w t-

the flagship said grandon ill row
and bail its our only chance

  with the strong strokes of grandon
assisting the sail of the swift little vessel
they were able to gain rapidly on the ship
which was at the apex of the wedge-
shaped squadron as they drew near it
kantar called

   it is the flagship majesty

  good preserve absolute silence from
now on replied grandon if possible
we must get aboard her without being
detected

  presently they came so dose that they
could hear the sounds of conversation
and people moving about yet their boat
went unnoticed because the mast-iights
of the flagship were so small as to cast
little illumination in their direction the
beams of the powerful searchlights from
the ship were directed ahead as were
those of the ships which flanked it on
either side

  thus it was that they came up under
the stern of the pirate vessel without at-
tracting attention by this time their
boat was half filled with water despite
grandons bailing and likely to sink at
any moment

  depending from two pulleys high
above them were the two chains by means
of which the rudder was turned from
the steersmans cabin in the front of the
ship

  you climb one chain directed
grandon while i go up the other we
are of nearly the same weight so if we
climb at the same time each will counter-
balance the other and the steersman may
not notice anything amiss

  leaping out onto the rudder gran-
don seized the chain on the side opposite
them at the same moment kantar
grasped the chain next to the boat and
the two went up hand over hand just
as kantar left the little boat her gun-


weird tales

wales went under and before they had
gotten half-way up the chains her mast-
head disappeared from view they had
reached the flagship just in time

  together the two men vent over the
railing each drawing his scarbo as he
did so a single watchman stood between
them but before he had time even to
touch a weapon a thrust from one side
and a cut from the other simultaneously
delivered laid him low

  between them they heaved the body
overboard

  now said grandon well search
the ship

  but scarcely had the words left his
mouth ere there came a cry from the
masthead followed by a shot as a tork
bullet struck the deck between them

  enemies on board called the look-
out two tall strangers on the after
deck they have slain the guard

  he continued to fire his tork but for-
tunately for grandon and kantar the
light was not good and the two men
quickly found temporary refuge by dodg-
ing into an empty rear cabin

  this is a trap said grandon we
cant remain here

  and yet replied kantar it is a
good place to make a stand

  but the decision as to whether they
would or would not remain was not left
to them for the door suddenly burst open
and one of the hairless toothless yellow
pirates with scarbo in one hand and
knife in the other leaped in yelling like
a demon

  grandon quickly silenced him with a
thrust to the throat but his place was
immediately taken by two more while
others pressed in from behind shouting
kill the foreigners cut down the
strangers

  grandon and kantar were a pair diffi-
cult to best with blades of any sort and

it was not long before the floor in front
of them was piled breast-high with the
bodies of their foes but suddenly an
officer called an order from without the
men directly in front of them withdrew
and a small glass globe was hurled against
the wall behind them

  as it shattered into tiny fragments
grandon was conscious for a moment of
an intensely acrid odor then with senses
reeling he saw kantar sink to the floor
a moment later he too lost conscious-
ness

the effects of the gas in the tiny
globe were evidently but momentary
for when grandon once more recovered
his senses he was being lifted from the
cabin floor by two pirates the pile of
bodies had been removed and kantar
was being led through the cabin door by
two more pirates both men had been
disarmed and their hands were bound
behind their backs

  an officer in the uniform of a mojak
ordered them brought forward and into
a large cabin at the front of the ship in
this cabin another officer whose uniform
proclaimed him romojak of the fleet was
seated at a table sipping kova

  whom have we here san thoy
asked the romojak as the two prisoners
were brought before him it appears
that we have captured a royal prisoner if
the taller one rightfully wears the scar-
let

  he does excellency replied san
thoy for i recognize him from his de-
scription as grandon of terra torrogo
of reabon

  small wonder then that our warriors
were mowed down like frella grass at
harvest said the romojak for few
men can face him scarbo in hand and
live he arose and bowed to grandon
i am honored your majesty he said
by your unexpected visit to my humble
buccaneers of venus



ship now that you are here i trust that
you and your warrior will remain as our
guests

  who are you you yellow knave
demanded grandon and what have you
done with her majesty the torroga of
reabon

  the romojak returned his haughty
look

  i am thid yet romojak of the fleets
of huitsen he answered with exagger-
ated deference and your imperial maj-
estys humble servant as to her majes-
ty the torroga of reabon i know ab-
solutely nothing if you seek her here
you have been misinformed as to her
whereabouts

  i perceive said grandon that you
are as skilled in the art of lying as in
that of abduction but mark you this
although the huitsenni have gone for
many generations unpunished they shall
not escape this time whereas huitsen
is now an unsavory word when the fleets
of reabon have done it will be but a
stinking memory except on one condi-
tion

  i will inquire the condition out of
courtesy although your threats do not
impress me said thid yet

  that you immediately place my wife
my warrior and myself safely back on
reabonian soil

  i can only repeat said thid yet
that i know nothing whatever of the
whereabouts of her majesty your wife
as for placing you and your soldier safe-
ly back upon reabonian soil we shall
be delighted to do this for you this
however would entail some expense and
no slight danger to us and as you came
aboard our ship unbidden we feel that
it is only fair that we should be reim-
bursed to the slight extent of say a
hundred thousand white slaves young
and strong and a million keds of gold

  what you ask the price of an em-
pire to set us ashore exclaimed kantar
and a hundred thousand slaves besides
one does not set a torrogo of reabon
ashore every day replied thid yet with
his toothless grin

  set my wife ashore with us unharmed
and i will pay you two million keds of
gold said grandon the second million
in lieu of the hundred thousand slaves
a commodity in which i do not care to
traffic

  again thid yet grinned

  im afraid i shall have to ask you to
be our guests for an indefinite period of
time he said show them to the guest
chambers san thoy

  grandon and kantar were hustled out
of the cabin and along the deck to a
hatchway leading into the hold down
this they were lowered like freight and
each was seized by a grinning yellow
man

  to the guest chambers ordered
san thoy and strolled away

  the two new guards hustled the pris-
oners along a dimly lighted passageway
threw them with their hands still bound
behind them into a small evil-smelling
room and closed and bolted the door
after them

  having been flung violently into the
room grandons head collided with one
of the stalwart ribs which braced the ships
sides dazing hirr momentarily he was
brought back to full consciousness by
kantar calling to him

  are you hurt majesty

  a bit dazed replied grandon bat
ill be all right soon and you

  only bruised a little

  then come over here and let me see
if i can loose your bonds we must get
out some way and search the ship

  soon the two men were seated on the
damp filthy floor bade to back and gran-


weird tales

don was working desperately at the bonds
which held kantars wrists opening the
tight knots which the yellow sailors had
tied would have been no easy task even
with his eyes to guide him and his hands
free but he worked patiently doggedly
until at length a knot was opened soon
a second yielded and kantar with an ex-
clamation of relief chafed his numbed
wrists for a moment then swiftly began
the task of releasing grandons hands
this took less time as the gunner could
work with his hands in front of him

when grandon had restored the
circulation to his wrists he tried
the door it was of thick planking and
bolted so tightly that he could not budge
it but the planks after having been fas-
tened together had evidently shrunk a
little as there were narrow cracks be-
tween them and on each side between
door and frame by placing an eye to
one of these cracks grandon was able
to look out into the dimly lighted hall-
way where a guard paced back and forth
kantar examined the lock and said
if i only had a knife i could lift that
bolt and open the door

  unfortunately replied grandon
we have no knife nor have we anything
which will answer for one it is possible
however that we can get the guard to
open the door

  how

  by pretending that one of us is kill-
ing the other dead prisoners are of no
use to the huitsenni let us first make
believe that we are quarreling you will
lie on the floor with your hands behind
you as if they were still bound first we
will quarrel then you will thump on the
floor with your hands and shout that you
iare being kicked to death let us try it
kantar accordingly took his place on
the floor while grandon stood where he
would be behind the door when it was

opened and looked out into the hallway
as soon as the guard approached he
raised his voice and began abusing kan-
tar with choice patoan epithets accusing
him of having gotten him into the scrape
and threatening to kill him then and
there

  kantar replied apparently pleading
for clemency and grandon saw the guard
pause outside and listen with a broad
grin on his face but when kantar began
thumping on the floor with the palm of
his hand and shouting that he was being
killed the expression on the guards face
grew serious and he quickly opened the
door

  scarcely had he stepped inside ere
grandon sprang seizing him from be-
hind with a strangle hold he jerked him
backward shutting off his wind at the
same time kantar stood up and quickly
deprived him of his weapons

  close the door kantar until we talk
to this fellow said grandon

  now said the earth-man when the
gunner had complied we want to know
where her majesty of reabon is im-
prisoned if you go with us quietly and
show us the place you will live if not
you will die nod your head if you
agree

  the guard whose voice was complete-
ly shut off nodded weakly and grandon
loosened the hold on his throat permit-
ting him to breathe once more

  give me the scarbo kantar said
grandon and retain the tork and knife
for yourself keep a good hold on this
fellows harness and do not hesitate to
use your knife if he makes one move to
betray us

  in such an event i will use it with
great pleasure majesty said kantar
grimly

  carefully opening the door grandon
buccaneers of venus



peered out there was no one in the
hallway

  where is the other guard he asked
their captive

  he patrols the forward corridor
majesty replied the guard respectfully
it is connected with this one by two
smaller corridors that branch around the
central hatchway he does not come into
this corridor except at my call

  good then lead us to the princess
by the safest route and remember if
we are discovered through fault of yours
you die

  thus admonished the thoroughly
cowed guard led them to a ladder which
descended into the corridor from the
side and with kantar gripping his har-
ness with one hand and his keen knife
with the other softly ascended they
came on deck near the stern and quietly
made their way forward keeping in the
shadow of the cabins in order not to be
observed by the lookout at the mast-
head

  they had covered about half the dis-
tance toward the forward cabin for which
they were heading when grandon sud-
denly noticed a short thick-set individual
who had apparently just emerged from
one of the cabins carrying a bundle in
his arms and hurrying toward one of the
four small boats slung on this side of the
craft

  after placing the bundle which was
nearly as long as himself in the boat the
fellow whom grandon now recognized
as san thoy climbed in himself and
rapidly lowered the little craft to the
water by means of the two ropes which
passed through pulleys suspended on
davits he and his two companions flat-
tened themselves against the cabin wall
until the small boat had disappeared from
view over the rail-then went forward
once more

  presently their conductor stopped be-
fore a door and whispered

   this is her cabin

while kantar watched their guide
grandon tried the cabin door and
finding it unlocked stepped inside by
the rays of the tiny overhead light which
illuminated the little room he could see
at a glance that it was deserted his
brow clouded and it would have gone ill
with the yellow man who had led him
to this cabin had he not noticed some-
thing on the floor which glinted in the
light he picked it np and recognized
it instantly as one of the jewels from
vernias coiffure

  stepping out of the cabin once more
he seized the guards shoulder in a grip
of iron

   she is not here he said sternly and
raised his scarbo as if he were about to
lay the fellows head open

  spare me majesty implored the yel-
low man this was her cabin i swear
it

  then how do you explain her ab-
sence speak quickly if you would live
i see it all majesty said the guard
suddenly we are too late

too late what do you mean
your majesty saw san thoy with the
bundle-san thoy the debauched-who
spends all his earnings for beautiful slave-
girls he would dare much to possess
the most beautiful woman of zorovia
then we will follow san thoy said
grandon and you will go with us per-
haps you can give us an idea where he has
gone to the nearest boat kantar and
use your tork if the lookout sees us
he will not see us majesty said the
guard of that i am sure as san thoy
must have seen to it that he is either
drugged or dead-probably the latter
true to the prediction of the yellow
guard there was no alarm from the mast-


weird tales

head nor from any other part of the ship
as they lowered the boat to the water and
cast off it was equipped with a small
sail which they raised as soon as the fleet
was far enough away to make it improb-
able that it would be observed

  now said grandon which way do
you think san thoy sailed

  i can not be sure replied the guard
but the nearest land is the island of the
valkars it has a small cove accessible in
a small boat where the huitsertni often
stop for fresh water and where they have
erected a small but strong shelter into
which they may retire if surprized by a
large force of the terrible inhabitants of
the place it may be that he has gone to
this shelter for the night intending to
embark for some safer place tomorrow
can you guide us to it

  i can but try majesty i am no navi-
gator like san thoy who can probably
win safely across the shoals into the cove
without even the aid of a light but the
island is a large one and i know the gen-
eral direction if i steer properly we
should reach some part of its rugged coast
in a short time

  then said kantar grimly see that
you steer properly if you would live to
see tomorrows light

  the mast lights of the fleet were twink-
ling faintly in the distance as the yellow
man took the tiller and swinging it
around set his course after taking the
precaution of securing his prisoners ankle
with a piece of rope kantar sat down a
short distance ahead of him and managed
to sail while grandon kept watch in the
front of the craft

  they had not traveled far before the
boom of breakers sounded ahead

  there is the island of the valkars
said the prisoner but i know not how to
find the cove if we should try to land
anywhere else we would be almost cer-

tain either to be dashed to pieces on the
rugged shore or sunk by the jagged teeth
of one of the many hidden reefs which
circle the island if we do land in safety
we may be set upon in the darkness by the
valkars and carried away to be de-
voured

  what are these valkars asked
grandon

  i who have sailed every ocean of zo-
rovia have never seen creatures more hor-
rible said the yellow man endowed
with human intelligence they manufac-
ture and use weapons and implements of
metal yet they are not human nor even
mammalian they are amphibians twice
we fought them off when we landed for
water i was a member of the landing-
party although we outnumbered them
each time we lost several men in each en-
gagement some were tom to pieces and
devoured before our eyes others of our
slain and wounded were carried away

  but that was not all after our ships
had left the island following the first en-
gagement with the valkars those of our
men who had been stabbed cut bitten
or scratched in the battle though ever so
slightly began dying horrible deaths
our mojak who was wiser than most
had one of our valkar prisoners slain
and according to an ancient custom or-
dered every man who had received so
much as a scratch to either drink a draft
of its blood or eat a mouthful of its flesh
the men who complied with this order in
time lived but we did not know the rea-
son until later

  we took two captured valkars to
huitsen where they were examined by
our most learned scientists they found
that these creatures secrete a venom from
glands in their mouths and before going
into battle smear their weapons and
claws with it in their blood however is
a substance a small quantity of which
buccaneers of venus



counteracts the effect of the venom be-
cause they were venomous they apparent-
ly thought we were also and it was
evidently for that reason that some of our
men were torn to pieces on the battlefield
and their fragments distributed among
and devoured by our enemies

  while they were talking grandon had
been straining his eyes into the darkness
before them suddenly he exclaimed

  i see a light dead ahead

  then i have steered better than i
could have hoped said the yellow pirate
for it must be the light from the cabin
in the cove we will be there shortly if
we can pass through the shoals un-
scathed

  he set his course dead ahead asking
grandon to watch the light and direct
him as he was unable to see it from the
stern on account of the sail this gran-
don did and was greatly mystified as he
watched for although the light had
seemed to be not more than a mile away
when he first saw it and they continued
to sail swiftly toward it it did not in-
crease in brightness or apparent nearness
it seemed to have an unnatural phosphor-
escent gleam also that would scarcely be
expected to come from a cabin light

  the breakers roared louder and louder
as they progressed suddenly their hull
glanced from a submerged rock scraped
a second and smashed head on into a
third there was a rending crash as the
little craft swung half around buffeted
by the waves for a moment before a huge
roller engulfed her

  just beyond the treacherous shoal two
men struggled desperately in the boiling
seething water in an effort to reach the
shore but the third had gone down
never to rise again

the toad people

panting heavily from his exertions
san thoy leaned gloatingly over ver-
nia lying where he had thrown her on the
sleeping-shelf but his look of exultation
suddenly turned to one of amazement
when she drew back one foot and planted
her heel in his solar plexus with such
force that he staggered back across the
little cabin gasping for breath until
tripped by a chair and thrown to the floor

  she did not wait to see what he would
do next but sprang to her feet and dashed
out of the cabin

   san thoy vas unusually agile for a man
of his rotund build so she had not taken
ten steps beyond the door of the cabin
before he was up and after her

  bounding off into the darkness with no
sense of direction and no thought in
mind save that of escaping the monster
from whose clutches she had just broken
vernia suddenly became conscious that
many pairs of gleaming eyes reflecting
the light from the opening cabin door
were looking out at her from the sur-
rounding darkness

   with a little scream of terror she halt-
ed in her tracks and san thoy uttering a
cry of triumph leaped forward to recap-
ture her but a keen barbed hook on the
end of a long pole suddenly shot out from
the darkness at his right changing his tri-
umphant shout to an agonized shriek as
it sank into his shoulder it jerked him
backward so that his feet flew from under
him and he sat down with considerable
violence

  at the same time a heavy body came
hurtling through the air and landed on
two webbed feet in front of vernia it
was about the height of a large man and
stood erect on two bowed legs with its
toes turned so far outward that the two
feet with the heels together were almost


weird tales

in line the body was thick and heavy
and covered with scales in front on the
back and sides these scales were inter-
spersed with huge bumps which were also
in evidence on the backs of the upper and
lower limbs and on the head the mouth
was an enormous slit which reached
nearly from ear to ear armed with saw-
like ridges of jaw-bone in lieu of teeth
the eyes were large and set in bony soc-
kets that protruded above the cheek-bones
like the feet the hands were webbed and
armed with sharp claws

  thus the creature which stood before
vernia might have been nothing more
than a very large and ferocious-looking
toad but the fact that it carried weapons
-a pole with a hook on the end like that
which had impaled san thoy and a mace
with a curved bill which hung by a thong
from its wrist and that it wore a belt in
which a large knife was thrust made it
evident that this was no commontoad
but infinitely more formidable and ter-
rible than a creature with the mind as well
as the body of a toad could have been its
use of weapons was evidence of an intel-
ligence which was at least equal to that of
the most primitive men

  uttering a hoarse croaking cry that
displayed for a moment the red interior
of its cavernous maw the creature threw
a cold scaly arm around vernias waist
and slung her over its shoulder with an
ease that bespoke enormous strength
after struggling desperately for a mo-
ment she realized the futility of attempt-
ing to pit her strength against that of
the monster and lay still

   as if it had been a signal or a call the
sound made by her captor brought a score
of the creatures circling around them all
armed like the first the beast that had
captured san thoy unhooked him without
any attention to his cries of anguish and
threw him writhing and moaning over

its warty shoulder then the entire group
led by vernias captor marched away

  as it was pitch-dark after they left the
vicinity of the lighted cabin vernia was
unable to see where they were going she
judged however from the movements of
her captor that they were traversing some
exceedingly rugged country presently
this gave way to marshy lowlands
through which the toad-men leaped and
splashed then to firmer ground covered
with tall coarse grass that brushed against
vernia as she was carried through it

  when the coming of the dawn made it
possible for her to see she found herself
in the midst of a city of low moss-cov-
ered mounds in each of these mounds a
hole on the ground level about three feet
in diameter served as a doorway and
from most of the doorways the huge in-
quiring eyes of the inhabitants peeped
curiously out at the prisoners as they were
being brought in

  many of the other creatures which were
moving about the place paused to stare at
vernia as if they had never seen any one
of her race before san thoy it appeared
was of a race which they had previously
seen at least he did not attract nearly
so much attention

  a shallow sluggish stream with muddy
bottom meandered through the center of
the village and seated on its banks or
partly submerged in its leisurely flowing
water a number of the creatures dozed
languidly

  the adult creatures on the bank and in
the water vernia noticed were all fe-
males - smaller than the males and if
possible more hideous but hopping and
crawling around them and swimming in
the muddy water were hundreds of
youngsters apparently newly hatched in-
fants none over eight inches tall

  her captor chancing to walk quite near
the bank with her vernia saw with some
buccaneers of venus



surprize that the placidly dozing females
was there for a purpose that of hatching
their young for she saw one of the large
bumps on the back of the nearest female
suddenly burst open and an infant after
tumbling out into the mud make straight
for the water and dive in its mother
paid no attention whatever to the incident
nor did she so much as turn to look at her
offspring several other lumps on her
back had already burst open and she was
waiting for the rest to do the same

presently her captor left the bank of
the stream and after threading many
pathways between the numerous mounds
stopped before a mound which was much
larger than any of the others and ap-
peared to be in the very heart of the city
it had a number of entrances but her
captor chose the largest and stopping
walked through it into a large dome-like
room which was lighted by a peculiar
phosphorescent radiance that gave every-
thing a ghastly greenish tint this pecu-
liar light came from immense writhing
glowworms suspended on chains over-
head the air of the place was filled with
a musty stench similar to that which ver-
nia had noticed outside but here so strong
as to be almost overpowering

  her captor swung her down from his
warty shoulders and set her on her feet
then she was whirled around to face a
creature much more repulsive-looking
than the one that had captured her it
was squatting on the slimy cap of a gray
toadstool set against the rear wall star-
ing at her with its goggling gold-rimmed
eyes its scaly hide draped its body in
wrinkled folds and there was about it a
look of dried-up emaciation as if it were
very old and partly mummified

  one taloned hand held a huge mace
with a curved bill the other toyed with
the hilt of a long curved knife that hung

from a massive chain girdling the mon-
sters middle

  on either side of the fungoid throne
occupied by the hideous creature was a
yellow man of huitsen standing with
folded arms in the attitude of a slave
these two pirates captives of the toad
people and evidently in attendance on the
repulsive thing which seemed to be in
authority were quite filthy and clothed
in a few tattered rags which had once
been garments both leered at the beau-
tiful captive with their cat-like eyes and
grinned toothlessly

   after staring at her for fully five min-
utes the squat monster on the toadstool
rolled its gold-rimmed eyes toward the
yellow man who stood at its right and
emitted a rapid succession of hoarse
booming croaks

  much to vernias surprize the man
replied in a human approximation of the
same sounds-evidently the language of
the toad people then he addressed ver-
nia his majesty wishes to know your
name and whence you came he said in
patoa

  vernia raised her eyebrows his ma-
jesty do you refer to that croaking mon-
ster

   i refer to grunk rogo of the valkars
on this island his wish is law it will be
wise for you to answer his question

  tell him that i am vernia torroga
of reabon she directed and that he
will be richly rewarded if i am returned
unharmed to my people

  for several minutes the toad ruler and
the yellow man carried on a croaking con-
versation then the latter addressed ver-
nia once more

  his majesty knows nothing of re-
wards nor is he concerned with them
said he it was difficult for me to con-
vey the idea to him in the valkar lan-


weird tales

guage and even then it did not impress
him he is interested in you for one
reason and that is because you are the first
human female his warriors have ever cap-
tured a number of the huitsenni who
stop at this island for fresh water have
been captured and enslaved from time to
time by the toad people as we are more
skilful than they in mining and smelting
metals and in the manufacture of wea-
pons tools chains and ornaments they
set us at these tasks they recognize also
that some of us have superior cunning
i hui sen and my brother lui sen are
retained for that reason as counsellors for
the rogo we try to do our work well for
as long as we prove useful we will be kept
alive but if our work displeases grunk
we will either be killed and eaten by the
valkars or fed to sistabez

  and who is sistabez

  the deity of the toad people they
think him a god though he is only a
snake-an immense serpent who must be
at least a thousand years old for he has
outlived many generations of valkars
as far back as valkar tradition goes sis-
tabez has lived in his cave in the moun-
tainside emerging at regular intervals
when hungry at such times living sacri-
fices are fed to him in order to keep him
from raiding the village which he has
done several times when sacrifices were
not brought promptly

  sometimes he devours but one victim
at other times he is not satisfied with less
than three or four when he is seen
emerging from his cave guards sound the
alarm and a victim is chained to a stake
in his path a second victim is chained
farther down the pathway and a third
still farther he may devour only the
first or perhaps the first and second but
sometimes he comes on and devours the
third if he turns back to his cave then
all is well if not a fourth victim is

chained in his pathway never has he
been known to devour more than four vic-
tims at one meal but wo be to the val-
kars if he becomes angry for then he will
wantonly slay hundreds before returning
to his lair

  once more hui sen turned and defer-
entially addressed grunk in the croaking
language for some time the rogo of the
valkars made no reply but continued to
stare at vernia with his round gold-
rimmed eyes then apparently having
come to some decision he croaked an
order to the yellow slave

  his majesty said hui sen has de-
cided to retain you alive that you may
serve the purpose for which females were
created and thus multiply the number of
his slaves later he will make some men-
tal physical tests among the slaves to de-
termine who shall be your mate

  up to this moment vernia had desired
to live hoping in the face of despair that
she might some day be restored to gran-
don but as the significance of hui sens
words sank into her brain her one desire
was for speedy death the hilt of her
captors knife projected invitingly beside
her suddenly turning she whipped it
from the sheath and drew it back to
plunge it into her bosom but lui sen
standing beside the throne while less talk-
ative than his brother was more observ-
ing and the first to perceive her intention
with a cat-like spring he alighted in front
of her seized her wrist and wrenched the
knife from her grasp then the rogo
croaked an order and vernias captor
dragged her out of the hut

  she was led through the village of
moss-covered mounds toward a large
mound in the midst of an extensive en-
closure surrounded by a paling of metal
bars and guarded by armed valkars
after exchanging croaks with her con-
ductor one of the guards opened a gate
buccaneers of venus



and she was pushed into the enclosure
here several hundred huitsenni slaves
were at work forging sharpening and
polishing weapons for their batrachian
masters under the supervision of armed
valkar overseers the forges were hol-
lowed stones in which were beds of live
coals the bellows were the lungs of huge
valkars who blew through reed tubes
which entered holes in the bottoms of the
forges the anvils were large rounded
stones beside which the yellow workers
squatted as they hammered out hooks
mace-heads and knife-blades

the place was a bedlam-the clank-
ing of metal the roar of flames the
croaks of the overseers and the chatter of
the slaves the floor of the enclosure was
littered with filth and everywhere spat-
tered with red kerra juice the valkars
though they did not use the narcotic them-
selves evidently believed that it made
their human slaves more efficient and
kept them well supplied with the pods
containing the red spores which they
mumbled from morning to night with
their toothless gums and spat unbeliev-
able quantities of reddened saliva all
about them

  other workers were sharpening the
knife-blades hook-points and barbs and
mace bills with rough stones and still
others were polishing them with sand
the metal parts then went to the assem-
blers where the knives and maces were
fitted with wooden handles and the hooks
with long shafts

  sickened by the squalor of the place
and overwhelmed with horror at thought
of the fate which grunk rogo of the val-
kars planned for her vernia shrank back
against the bars of the enclosure the
yellow ex-pirates seemed fully aware of
grunks intentions with regard to her
and raised lascivious eyes from their work

to drink in her beauty the while they ban-
died coarse jests and speculated as to who
would be the lucky slave to draw this
prize of feminine pulchritude for whom
mighty emperors had contended in vain

  quite near her a group of huitsenni
was assembling knives tossing them into
a central pile when finished with one
of these in her possession she could
swiftly defeat the purpose of grunk it
was only a few steps to the pile would
they divine her purpose

  she decided that a circuitous route
would be the least likely to make them
suspicious so she set off first in the
opposite direction pausing to watch vari
ous groups of workers as if greatly inter-
ested in what they were doing the
coarse jokes of each group subsided as she
drew near each in turn they were more
than a little awed by the imminence of the
torroga of reabon and there were a
number of egotistical creatures among
them who strove to impress her with at-
tempts at dignity and gentle bearing

  last of all she approached the group
of workers surrounding the rapidly
mounting pile of knives casually she
picked up one of the finished weapons as
if to examine it with a swift movement
she raised it aloft poised above her breast

  a greasy yellow hand reached over her
shoulder-seized her wrist and shook the
knife from her grasp then a coarse
laugh grated in her ear

  she spun around to face the filthy and
ragged hui sen evidently he had been
stealthily following her for some time

  come he grinned toothlessly retain-
ing a tight grip in her wrist from now
on you belong to me for i am the rogos

was necessary to roman satisfaction and
titus sulla was justly proud for he was
military governor of ebbracum and an-
swerable only to the emperor of rome
he was a strongly built man of medium
height with the hawk-like features of the
pure-bred roman now a mocking
smile curved his full lips increasing the
arrogance of his haughty aspect dis-
tinctly military in appearance he wore
the golden-scaled corselet and chased
breastplate of his rank with the short
stabbing sword at his belt and he held
on his knee the silvered helmet with its
plumed crest behind him stood a clump
of impassive soldiers with shield and
spear-blond titans from the rhineland

  before him was taking place the scene
which apparently gave him so much real
gratification-a scene common enough
wherever stretched the far-flung bound-
aries of rome a rude cross lay flat
upon the barren earth and on it was bound
a man-half naked wild of aspect with
his corded limbs glaring eyes and shock
of tangled hair his executioners were
roman soldiers and with heavy hammers
they prepared to pin the victims hands
and feet to the wood with iron spikes

  only a small group of men watched
this ghastly scene in the dread place of
execution beyond the city walls the gov-
ernor and his watchful guards a few
young roman officers the man to whom
sulla had referred as guest and who
stood like a bronze image unspeaking
beside the gleaming splendor of the ro-
man the quiet garb of this man seemed
drab almost somber

  he was dark but he did not resemble
the latins around him there was about
him none of the warm almost oriental
sensuality of the mediterranean which
colored their features the blond bar-
barians behind sullas chair were less un-
like the man in facial outline than were

the romans not his were the full curv-
ing red lips nor the rich waving locks
suggestive of the greek nor was his
dark complexion the rich olive of the
south rather it was the bleak darkness of
the north the whole aspect of the man
vaguely suggested the shadowed mists the
gloom the cold and the icy winds of the
naked northern lands even his black
eyes were savagely cold like black fires
burning through fathortis of ice

  his height was only medium but there
was something about him which trans-
cended mere physical bulk-a certain
fierce innate vitality comparable only to
that of a wolf or a panther in every
line of his supple compact body as well
as in his coarse straight hair and thin
lips this was evident-in the hawk-like
set of the head on the corded neck in the
broad square shoulders in the deep chest
the lean loins the narrow feet built
with the savage economy of a panther he
was an image of dynamic potentialities
pent in with iron self-control

  at his feet crouched one like him in
complexion-but there the resemblance
ended this other was a stunted giant
with gnarly limbs thick body a low slop-
ing brow and an expression of dull feroc-
ity now clearly mixed with fear if the
man on the cross resembled in a tribal
way the man titus sulla called guest he
far more resembled the stunted crouching
giant

  well partha mac othna said the
governor with studied effrontery when
you return to your tribe you will have a
tale to tell of the justice of rome who
rules the south

  i will have a tale answered the other
in a voice which betrayed no emotion just
as his dark face schooled to immobility
showed no evidence of the maelstrom in
his soul

said sulla pax romana reward for
virtue punishment for wrong he
laughed inwardly at his own black hypoc-
risy then continued you see emissary
of pictland how swiftly rome punishes
the transgressor

  i see answered the piet in a voice
which strongly-curbed anger made deep
with menace that the subject of a for-
eign king is dealt with as though he were
a roman slave

  he has been tried and condemned in
an unbiased court retorted sulla

  aye and the accuser was a roman
the witnesses roman the judge roman
he committed murder in a moment of
fury he struck down a roman merchant
who cheated tricked and robbed him and
to injury added insult-aye and a blow
is his king but a dog that rome cruci-
fies his subjects at will condemned by
roman courts is his king too weak or
foolish to do justice were he informed
and foimal charges brought against the
offender

  well said sulla cynically you may
inform bran mak morn yourself rome
my friend makes no account of her ac-
tions to barbarian kings when savages
come among us let them act with discre-
tion or suffer the consequences

the piet shut his iron jaws with a
snap that told sulla further badger-
ing would elicit no reply the roman
made a gesture to the executioners one
of them seized a spike and placing it
against the thick wrist of the victim
smote heavily the iron point sank deep
through the flesh crunching against the
bones the lips of the man on the cross
writhed though no moan escaped him
as a trapped wolf fights against his cage
the bound victim instinctively wrenched
and struggled the veins swelled in his
temples sweat beaded his low forehead

the muscles in arms and legs writhed and
knotted the hammers fell in inexorable
strokes driving the cruel points deeper
and deeper through wrists and ankles
blood flowed in a black river over the
hands that held the spikes staining the
wood of the cross and the splintering of
bones was distinctly heard yet the suf-
ferer made no outcry though his black-
ened lips writhed back until the gnms
were visible and his shaggy head jerked
involuntarily from side to side

  the man called partha mac othna
stood like an iron image eyes burning
from an inscrutable face his whole body
hard as iron from the tension of his con-
trol at his feet crouched his misshapen
servant hiding his face from the grim
sight his arms locked about his masters
knees those arms gripped like steel and
under his breath the fellow mumbled
ceaselessly as if in invocation

   the last stroke fell the cords were cut
from arm and leg so that the man would
hang supported by the nails alone he
had ceased his struggling that only twist-
ed the spikes in his agonizing wounds
his bright black eyes unglazed had not
left the face of the man called partha mac
othna in them lingered a desperate shad-
ow of hope now the soldiers lifted the
cross and set the end of it in the hole pre-
pared stamped the dirt about it to hold it
erect the piet hung in midair suspend-
ed by the nails in his flesh but still no
sound escaped his lips his eyes still
hung on the somber face of the emissary
but the shadow of hope was fading

   hell live for days said sulla cheer-
fully these piets are harder than cats
to kill ill keep a guard of ten soldiers
watching night and day to see that no one
takes him down before he dies ho
there valerius in honor of our esteemed
neighbor king bran mak mom give
him a cup of wine
worms of the earth



  with a laugh the young officer came
forward holding a brimming wine-cup
and rising on his toes lifted it to the
parched lips of the sufferer in the black
eyes flared a red wave of unquenchable
hatred writhing his head aside to avoid
even touching the cup he spat full into
the young romans eyes with a curse
valerius dashed the cup to the ground
and before any could halt him wrenched
out his sword and sheathed it in the mans
body

  sulla rose with an imperious exclama-
tion of anger the man called partha mac
othna had started violently but he bit his
lip and said nothing valerius seemed
somewhat surprized at him as he sullenly
cleansed his sword the act had been in-
stinctive following the insult to roman
pride the one thing unbearable

  give up your sword young sir ex-
claimed sulla centurion publius place
him under arrest a few days in a cell
with stale bread and water will teach
you to curb your patrician pride in mat-
ters dealing with the will of the empire
what you young fool do you not realize
that you could not have made the dog a
more kindly gift who would not rather
desire a quick death on the sword than
the slow agony on the cross take him
away and you centurion see that
guards remain at the cross so that the body
is not cut down until the ravens pick bare
the bones partha mac othna i go to a
banquet at the house of demetrius-will
you not accompany me

  the emissary shook his head his eyes
fixed on the limp form which sagged on
the black-stained cross he made no
reply sulla smiled sardonically then
rose and strode away followed by his sec-
retary who bore the gilded chair ceremo-
niously and by the stolid soldiers with
whom walked valerius head sunken

  the man called partha mac othna

flung a wide fold of his cloak about his
shoulder halted a moment to gaze at the
grim cross with its burden darkly etched
against the crimson sky where the clouds
of night were gathering then he stalked
away followed by his silent servant



in an inner chamber of ebbracum the
man called partha mac othna paced
tigerishly to and fro his sandalled feet
made no sound on the marble tiles

   grom he turned to the gnarled serv-
ant well i know vhy you held my
knees so tightly-why you muttered aid
of the moon-woman - you feared i
would lose my self-control and make 
mad attempt to succor that poor wretch
by the gods i believe that was what the
dog roman wished-his iron-cased watch-
dogs watched me narrowly i know and
his baiting was harder to bear than ordi-
narily

  gods black and white dark and
light he shook his clenched fists above
his head in the black gust of his passion
that i should stand by and see a man of
mine butchered on a roman cross -
without justice and with no more trial
than that farce black gods of rlyeh
even you would i invoke to the ruin and
destruction of those butchers i swear by
the nameless ones men shall die howl-
ing for that deed and rome shall cry out
as a woman in the dark who treads upon
an adder

he knew you master said grom

  the other dropped his head and cov-
ered his eyes with a gesture of savage
pain

  his eyes will haunt me when i lie
dying aye he knew me and almost
until the last i read in his eyes the hope
that i might aid him gods and devils
is rome to butcher my people beneath my
very eyes then i am not king but dog


weird tales

  not so loud in the name of all the
gods exclaimed grom in affright
did these romans suspect you were
bran mak morn they would nail you on
a cross beside that other

  they will know it ere long grimly
answered the king too long i have
lingered here in the guise of an emissary
spying upon mine enemies they have
thought to play with me these romans
masking their contempt and scorn only
under polished satire rome is courteous
to barbarian ambassadors they give us
fine houses to live in offer us slaves pan-
der to our lusts with women and gold
and wine and games but all the while
they laugh at us their very courtesy is an
insult and sometimes-as today-their
contempt discards all veneer bah ive
seen through their baitings-have re-
mained imperturbably serene and swal-
lowed their studied insults but this-
by the fiends of hell this is beyond hu-
man endurance my people look to me
if i fail them-if i fail even one-even
the lowest of my people who will aid
them to whom shall they turn by
the gods ill answer the gibes of these
roman dogs with black shaft and trench-
ant steel

  and the chief with the plumes
grom meant the governor and his gut-
turals thrummed with the blood-lust
he dies he flicked out a length of
steel

  bran scowled easier said than done
he dies-but how may i reach him by
day his german guards keep at his back
by night they stand at door and window
he has many enemies romans as well as
barbarians many a briton would gladly
slit his throat

  grom seized brans garment stammer-
ing as fierce eagerness broke the bonds of
his inarticulate nature

  let me go master my life is worth

nothing i will cut him down in the
midst of his warriors

  bran smiled fiercely and clapped his
hand on the stunted giants shoulder with
a force that would have felled a lesser
man

  nay old war-dog i have too much
need of thee you shall not throw your
life away uselessly sulla would read the
intent in your eyes besides and the jave-
lins of his teutons would be through you
ere you could reach him not by the
dagger in the dark will we strike this
roman not by the venom in the cup nor
the shaft from the ambush

  the king turned and paced the floor a
moment his head bent in thought
slowly his eyes grew murky with a
thought so fearful he did not speak it
aloud to the waiting warrior

  i have become somewhat familiar
with the maze of roman politics during
my stay in this accursed waste of mud and
marble said he during a war on the
wall titus sulla as governor of this
province is supposed to hasten thither
with his centuries but this sulla does
not do he is no coward but the bravest
avoid certain things-to each man how-
ever bold his own particular fear so he
sends in his place caius camillus who in
times of peace patrols the fens of the
west lest the britons break over the bor-
der and sulla takes his place in the
tower of trajan ha

  he whirled and gripped grom with
steely fingers

  grom take the red stallion and ride
north let no grass grow under the stal-
lions hoofs ride to cormac na con-
nacht and tell him to sweep the frontier
with sword and torch let his wild gaels
feast their fill of slaughter after a time
i will be with him but for a time i
have affairs in the west

  groms black eyes gleamed and he

                    w t-
worms of the earth



made a passionate gesture with his crooked
hand-an instinctive move of savagery

  bran drew a heavy bronze seal from
beneath his tunic

  this is my safe-conduct as an em-
issary to roman courts he said grimly
it will open all gates between this house
and baal-dor if any official questions
you too closely-here

  lifting the lid of an iron-bound chest
bran took out a small heavy leather bag
which he gave into the hands of the war-
rior

  when all keys fail at a gate said he
try a golden key go now

  there were no ceremonious farewells
between the barbarian king and his bar-
barian vassal grom flung up his arm in
a gesture of salute then turning he hur-
ried out

  bran stepped to a barred window and
gazed out into the moonlit streets

  wait until the moon sets he mut-
tered grimly then ill take the road to
-hell but before i go i have a debt
to pay

  the stealthy clink of a hoof on the
flags reached him

  with the safe-conduct and gold not
even rome can hold a pictish reaver
muttered the king now ill sleep until
the moon sets

with a snarl at the marble frieze-
work and fluted columns as sym-
bols of rome he flung himself down on
a couch from which he had long since
impatiently torn the cushions and silk
stuffs as too soft for his hard body hate
and the black passion of vengeance
seethed in him yet he went instantly to
sleep the first lesson he had learned in
his bitter hard life was to snatch sleep any
time he could like a wolf that snatches
sleep on the hunting trail generally his
w t-

slumber was as light and dreamless as a
panthers but tonight it was otherwise

  he sank into fleecy gray fathoms of
slumber and in a timeless misty realm of
shadows he met the tall lean white-
bearded figure of old gonar the priest
of the moon high counsellor to the
king and bran stood aghast for gonars
face was white as driven snow and he
shook as with ague well might bran
stand appalled for in all the years of his
life he had never before seen gonar the
wise show any sign of fear

  what now old one asked the king
goes all well in baal-dor

  all is well in baal-dor where my body
lies sleeping answered old gonar
across the void i have come to battle
with you for your soul king are you
mad this thought you have thought in
your brain

  gonar answered bran somberly
this day i stood still and watched a man
of mine die on the cross of rome what
his name or his rank i do not know i
do not care he might have been a faith-
ful unknown warrior of mine he might
have been an outlaw i only know that
he was mine the first scents he knew
were the scents of the heather the first
light he saw was the sunrise on the pictish
hills he belonged to me not to rome
if punishment was just then none but
me should have dealt it if he were to be
tried none but me should have been his
judge the same blood flowed in our
veins the same fire maddened our brains
in infancy we listened to the same old
tales and in youth we sang the same old
songs he was bound to my heart-
strings as every man and every woman
and every child of pictland is bound it
was mine to protect him now it is mine
to avenge him

but in the name of the gods bran
expostulated the wizard take your


weird tales

vengeance in another way return to the
heather-mass your warriors-join with
cormac and his gaels and spread a sea
of blood and flame the length of the
great wall

  all that i will do grimly answered
bran but now-now-i will have a
vengeance such as no roman ever
dreamed of ha what do they know of
the mysteries of this ancient isle which
sheltered strange life long before rome
rose from the marshes of the tiber
bran there are weapons too foul to
use even against rome

  bran barked short and sharp as a
jackal

  ha there are no weapons i would
not use against rome my back is at the
wall by the blood of the fiends has
rome fought me fair bah i am a bar-
barian king with a wolfskin mantle and
an iron crown fighting with my handful
of bows and broken pikes against the
queen of the world what have i the
heather hills the wattle huts the spears
of my shock-headed tribesmen and i
fight rome-with her armored legions
her broad fertile plains and rich seas-
her mountains and her rivers and her
gleaming cities - her wealth her steel
her gold her mastery and her wrath by
steel and fire i will fight her-and by
subtlety and treachery-by the thorn in
the foot the adder in the path the venom
in the cup the dagger in the dark aye
his voice sank somberly and by the
worms of the earth

  but it is madness cried gonar
you will perish in the attempt you
plan-you will go down to hell and you
will not return what of your people
then

  if i can not serve them i had better
die growled the king

  but you can not even reach the beings
you seek cried gonar for untold cen-

turies they have dwelt apart there is no
door by which you can come to them
long ago they severed the bonds that
bound them to the world we know

  long ago answered bran somberly
you told me that nothing in the universe
was separated from the stream of life-
a saying the truth of which i have often
seen evident no race no form of life
but is close-knit somehow by some man-
ner to the rest of life and the world
somewhere there is a thin link connecting
those i seek to the world i know some
where there is a door and somewhere
among the bleak fens of the west i will
find it

  stark horror flooded gonars eyes and
he gave back crying wo wo wo to
pictdom wo to the unborn kingdom
wo black wo to the sons of men wo
wo wo wo

bran awoke to a shadowed room and
the starlight on the window-bars
the moon had sunk from sight though
its glow was still faint above the house
tops memory of his dream shook him
and he swore beneath his breath

  rising he flung off cloak and mantle
donning a light shirt of black mesh-mail
and girding on sword and dirk going
again to the iron-bound chest he lifted
several compact bags and emptied the
clinking contents into the leathern pouch
at his girdle then wrapping his wide
cloak about him he silently left the house
no servants there were to spy on him-he
had impatiently refused the offer of slaves
which it was romes policy to furnish her
barbarian emissaries gnarled grom had
attended to all brans simple needs

  the stables fronted on the courtyard
a moments groping in the dark and he
placed his hand over a great stallions
nose checking the nicker of recognition
working without a light he swiftly bri-
worms of the earth



died and saddled the great brute and
went through the courtyard into a shad-
owy side-street leading him the moon
was setting the border of floating shad-
ows widening along the western wall
silence lay on the marble palaces and mud
hovels of ebbracum under the cold stars

  bran touched the pouch at his girdle
which was heavy with minted gold that
bore the stamp of rome he had come
to ebbracum posing as an emissary of
pictdom to act the spy but being a bar-
barian he had not been able to play his
part in aloof formality and sedate dignity
he retained a crowded memory of wild
feasts where wine flowed in fountains
of white-bosomed roman women who
sated with civilized lovers looked with
something more than favor on a virile
barbarian of gladiatorial games and of
other games where dice clicked and spun
and tall stacks of gold changed hands he
had drunk deeply and gambled recklessly
after the manner of barbarians and he
had had a remarkable run of luck due
possibly to the indifference with which he
won or lost gold to the piet was so
much dust flowing through his fingers
in his land there was no need of it but
he had learned its power in the boundaries
of civilization

  almost under the shadow of the north-
western wall he saw ahead of him loom
the great watch-tower which was connect-
ed with and reared above the outer wall
one corner of the castle-like fortress
farthest from the wall served as a dun-
geon bran left his horse standing in a
dark alley with the reins hanging on the
ground and stole like a prowling wolf
into the shadows of the fortress

  the young officer valerius was awak-
ened from a light unquiet sleep by a
stealthy sound at the barred window he
sat up cursing softly under his breath as
the faint starlight which etched the win-

dow-bars fell across the bare stone floor
and reminded him of his disgrace well
in a few days he ruminated hed be well
out of it sulla would not be too harsh on a
man with such high connections then let
any man or woman gibe at him damn
that insolent piet but wait he thought
suddenly remembering what of the
sound which had roused him

  hsssst it was a voice from the win-
dow

  why so much secrecy it could hardly
be a foe-yet why should it be a friend
valerius rose and crossed his cell coming
close to the window outside all was dim
in the starlight and he made out but a
shadowy form close to the window

  who are you he leaned close against
the bars straining his eyes into the gloom

  his answer was a snarl of wolfish
laughter a long flicker of steel in the star-
light valerius reeled away from the
window and crashed to the floor clutch-
ing his throat gurgling horribly as he
tried to scream blood gushed through
his fingers forming about his twitching
body a pool that reflected the dim star-
light dully and redly

  outside bran glided away like a shad-
ow without pausing to peer into the
cell in another minute the guards would
round the corner on their regular routine
even now he heard the measured tramp
of their iron-clad feet before they came
in sight he had vanished and they
clumped stolidly by the cell-windows with
no intimation of the corpse that lay on the
floor within

  bran rode to the small gate in the west-
ern wall unchallenged by the sleepy
watch what fear of foreign invasion in
ebbracum-and certain well organized
thieves and women-stealers made it prof-
itable for the watchmen not to be too vig-
ilant but the single guardsman at the
western gate-his fellows lay drunk in a


weird tales

near-by brothel - lifted his spear and
bawled for bran to halt and give an ac-
count of himself silently the piet reined
closer masked in the dark cloak he seemed
dim and indistinct to the roman who was
only aware of the glitter of his cold eyes
in the gloom but bran held up his hand
against the starlight and the soldier
caught the gleam of gold in the other
hand he saw a long sheen of steel the
soldier understood and he did not hes-
itate between the choice of a golden bribe
or a battle to the death with this unknown
rider who was apparently a barbarian of
some sort with a grunt he lowered his
spear and swung the gate open bran
rode through casting a handful of coins
to the roman they fell about his feet in
a golden shower clinking against the
flags he bent in greedy haste to retrieve
them and bran mak morn rode west-
ward like a flying ghost in the night



into the dim fens of the west came bran
mak morn a cold wind breathed
across the gloomy waste and against the
gray sky a few herons flapped heavily
the long reeds and marsh-grass waved in
broken undulations and out across the
desolation of the wastes a few still meres
reflected the dull light here and there
rose curiously regular hillocks above the
general levels and gaunt against the som-
ber sky bran saw a marching line of up-
right monoliths-menhirs reared by what
nameless hands

  a faint blue line to the west lay the
foothills that beyond the horizon grew to
the wild mountains of wales where dwelt
still wild celtic tribes-fierce blue-eyed
men that knew not the yoke of rome a
row of well-garrisoned watch-towers held
them in check even now far away
across the moors bran glimpsed the unas-

sailable keep men called the tower of
trajan

  these barren wastes seemed the dreary
accomplishment of desolation yet human
life was not utterly lacking bran met the
silent men of the fen reticent dark of
eye and hair speaking a strange mixed
tongue whose long-blended elements had
forgotten their pristine separate sources
bran recognized a certain kinship in these
people to himself but he looked on them
with the scorn of a pure-blooded patrician
for men of mixed strains

  not that the common people of cal-
edonia were altogether pure-blooded they
got their stocky bodies and massive limbs
from a primitive teutonic race which had
found its way into the northern tip of the
isle even before the celtic conquest of
britain was completed and had been ab-
sorbed by the piets but the chiefs of
brans folk had kept their blood from
foreign taint since the beginnings of
time and he himself was a pure-bred
piet of the old race but these fenmen
overrun repeatedly by british gaelic and
roman conquerors had assimilated blood
of each and in the process almost for-
gotten their original language and lin-
eage

  for bran came of a race that was very
old which had spread over western
europe in one vast dark empire before
the coming of the aryans when the ances-
tors of the celts the hellenes and the
germans were one primal people before
the days of tribal splitting-off and west-
ward drift

  only in caledonia bran brooded had
his people resisted the flood of aryan
conquest he had heard of a pictish peo-
ple called basques who in the crags of
the pyrenees called themselves an un-
conquered race but he knew that they had
paid tribute for centuries to the ancestors
of the gaels before these celtic conquer-
worms of the earth



ors abandoned their mountain-realm and
set sail for ireland only the piets of
caledonia had remained free and they
had been scattered into small feuding
tribes-he was the first acknowledged
king in five hundred years-the begin-
ning of a new dynasty-no a revival of
an ancient dynasty under a new name in
the very teeth of rome he dreamed his
dreams of empire

  he wandered through the fens seek-
ing a door of his quest he said nothing
to the dark-eyed fenmen they told him
news that drifted from mouth to mouth-
a tale of war in the north the skirl of
war-pipes along the winding wall of
gathering-fires in the heather of flame and
smoke and rapine and the glutting of
gaelic swords in the crimson sea of
slaughter the eagles of the legions were
moving northward and the ancient road
resounded to the measured tramp of the
iron-clad feet and bran in the fens of
the west laughed well pleased

  in ebbracum titus sulla gave secret
word to seek out the pictish emissary with
the gaelic name who had been under sus-
picion and who had vanished the night
young valerius was found dead in his cell
with his throat ripped out sulla felt that
this sudden bursting flame of war on the
wall was connected closely with his ex-
ecution of a condemned pictish criminal
and he set his spy system to work though
he felt sure that partha mac othna was
by this time far beyond his reach he
prepared to march from ebbracum but he
did not accompany the considerable force
of legionaries which he sent north sulla
was a brave man but each man has his
own dread and sullas was cormac na
connacht the black-haired prince of the
gaels who had sworn to cut out the gov-
ernors heart and eat it raw so sulla
rode with his ever-present bodyguard
westward where lay the tower of trajan

with its war-like commander caius camil-
lus who enjoyed nothing more than tak-
ing his superiors place when the red
waves of war washed at the foot of the
wall devious politics but the legate of
rome seldom visited this far isle and
what of his wealth and intrigues titus
sulla was the highest power in britain

  and bran knowing all this patiently
waited his coming in the deserted hut in
which he had taken up his abode

  one gray evening he strode on foot
across the moors a stark figure blackly
etched against the dim crimson fire of the
sunset he felt the incredible antiquity
of the slumbering land as he walked like
the last man on the day after the end of
the world yet at last he saw a token of
human life-a drab hut of wattle and
mud set in the reedy breast of the fen

a woman greeted him from the open
door and brans somber eyes nar-
rowed with a dark suspicion the
woman was not old yet the evil wisdom
of ages was in her eyes her garments were
ragged and scanty her black locks tan-
gled and unkempt lending her an aspect
of wildness well in keeping with her
grim surroundings her red lips laughed
but there was no mirth in her laughter
only a hint of mockery and under the
lips her teeth showed sharp and pointed
like fangs

  enter master said she if you do
not fear to share the roof of the witch-
woman of dagon-moor

  bran entered silently and sat him down
on a broken bench while the woman
busied herself with the scanty meal cook-
ing over an open fire on the squalid
hearth he studied her lithe almost ser-
pentine motions the ears which were
almost pointed the yellow eyes which
slanted curiously

  what do you seek in the fens my


weird tales

lord she asked turning toward him
with a supple twist of her whole body

  i seek a door he answered chin
resting on his fist i have a song to
sing to the worms of the earth

   she started upright a jar falling from
her hands to shatter on the hearth

  this is an ill saying even spoken in
chance she stammered

  i speak not by chance but by intent
he answered

  she shook her head i know not what
you mean

  well you know he returned aye
you know well my race is very old-
they reigned in britain before the nations
of the celts and the hellenes were born
out of the womb of peoples but my
people were not first in britain by the
mottles on your skin by the slanting of
your eyes by the taint in your veins i
speak with full knowledge and meaning
awhile she stood silent her lips smil-
ing but her face inscrutable

  man are you mad she asked that
in your madness you come seeking that
from which strong men fled screaming in
old times

  i seek a vengeance he answered
that can be accomplished only by them
i seek

  she shook her head

  you have listened to a bird singing
you have dreamed empty dreams

   i have heard a viper hiss he growled
and i do not dream enough of this
weaving of words i came seeking a link
between two worlds i have found it

  i need lie to you no more man of the
north answered the woman they
you seek still dwell beneath the sleeping
hills they have drawn apart farther
and farther from the world you know
but they still steal forth in the night
to grip women straying on the moors

said he his gaze on her slanted eyes she
laughed wickedly

  what would you of me

  that you bring me to them

  she flung back her head with a scorn-
ful laugh his left hand locked like iron
in the breast of her scanty garment and
his right closed on his hilt she laughed
in his face

  stiike and be damned my northern
wolf do you think that such life as mine
is so sweet that i would cling to it as a
babe to the breast

  his hand fell away

  you are right threats are foolish
i will buy your aid

  how the laugh voice hummed with
mockerr

  bran opened his pouch and poured into
his cupped palm a stream of gold

  more wealth than the men of the fen
ever dreamed of

  again she laughed what is this
rusty metal to me save it for some
white-breasted roman woman who will
play the traitor for you

  name me a price he urged the

head of an enemy--

   by the blood in my veins with its her-
itage of ancient hate who is mine enemy
but thee she laughed and springing
struck cat-like but her dagger splintered
on the mail beneath her cloak and he
flung her off with a loathsome flirt of his
wrist which tossed her sprawling across
her grass-strewn bunk lying there she
laughed up at him

  i will name you a price then my
wolf and it may be in days to come you
will curse the armor that broke atla s
dagger she rose and came close to him
her disquietingly long hands fastened
fiercely into his cloak  will tell you
black bran king of caledon oh i
knew you when you came into my hut
with your black hair and your cold eyes
worms of the earth



i will lead you to the doors of hell if you
wish-and the price shall be the kisses of
a king

   what of my blasted and bitter life i
whom mortal men loathe and fear i
have not known the love of men the
clasp of a strong arm the sting of human
kisses i atla the were-woman of the
moors what have i known but the lone
winds of the fens the dreary fire of cold
sunsets the whispering of the marsh
grasses-the faces that blink up at me in
the waters of the meres the foot-pad of
night-things in the gloom the glimmer
of red eyes the grisly murmur of name-
less beings in the night

  i am half-human at least have i
not known sorrow and yearning and cry-
ing wistfulness and the drear ache of
loneliness give to me king-give me
your fierce kisses and your hurtful bar-
barians embrace then in the long drear
years to come i shall not utterly eat out
my heart in vain envy of the white-bos-
omed women of men for i shall have a
memory few of them can boast-the
kisses of a king one night of love oh
king and i will guide you to the gates of
hell

  bran eyed her somberly he reached
forth and gripped her arm in his iron fin-
gers an involuntary shudder shook him
at the feel of her sleek skin he nodded
slowly and drawing her dose to him
forced his head down to meet her lifted
lips



the cold gray mists of dawn wrapped
king bran like a clammy cloak he
turned to the woman whose slanted eyes
gleamed in the gray gloom

  make good your part of the contract
he said roughly i sought a link between
worlds and in you i found it i seek the
one thing sacred to them it shall be the

key opening the door that lies unseen
between me and them tell me how i
can reach it

  i will the red lips smiied terribly
go to the mound men call dagons bar-
row draw aside the stone that blocks
the entrance and go under the dome
of the mound the floor of the chamber
is made of seven great stones six grouped
about the seventh lift out the center
stone-and you will see

  will i find the black stone he
asked

  dagons barrow is the door to the
black stone she answered if you dare
follow the road

  will the symbol be well guarded
he unconsciously loosened his blade in
its sheath the red lips curled mock-
ingly

  if you meet any on the road you will
die as no mortal man has died for long
centuries the stone is not guarded as
men guard their treasures why should
they guard what man has never sought
perhaps they will be near perhaps not
it is a chance you must take if you wish
the stone beware king of pictdom
remember it was your folk who so long
ago cut the thread that bound them to
human life they were almost human
then-they overspread the land and knew
the sunlight now they have drawn
apart they know not the sunlight and
they shun the light of the moon even
the starlight they hate far far apart
have they drawn who might have been
men in time but for the spears of your
ancestors

the sky was overcast with misty gray
through which the sun shone coldly
yellow when bran came to dagons bar-
row a round hillock overgrown with
rank grass of a curious fungoid appear-
ance on the eastern side of the mound


weird tales

showed the entrance of a crudely built
stone tunnel which evidently penetrated
the barrow one great stone blocked the
entrance to the tomb bran laid hold of
the sharp edges and exerted all his
strength it held fast he drew his
sword and worked the blade between the
blocking stone and the sill using the
sword as a lever he worked carefully and
managed to loosen the great stone and
wrench it out a foul charnel-house scent
flowed out of the aperture and the dim
sunlight seemed less to illuminate the cav-
ern-like opening than to be fouled by the
rank darkness which clung there

  sword in hand ready for he knew not
what bran groped his way into the tun-
nel which was long and narrow built
up of heavy joined stones and was too
low for him to stand erect either his
eyes became somewhat accustomed to the
gloom or the darkness was after all
somewhat lightened by the sunlight filter-
ing in through the entrance at any rate
he came into a round low chamber and
was able to make out its general dome-
like outline here no doubt in old
times had reposed the bones of him for
whom the stones of the tomb had been
joined and the earth heaped high above
them but now of those bones no vestige
remained on the stone floor and bend-
ing close and straining his eyes bran
made out the strange startlingly reg-
ular pattern of that floor six well-cut
slabs clustered about a seventh six-sided
stone

  he drove his sword-point into a crack
and pried carefully the edge of the
central stone tilted slightly upward a
little work and he lifted it out and leaned
it against the curving wall straining his
eyes downward he saw only the gaping
blackness of a dark well with small worn
steps that led downward and out of sight
he did not hesitate though the skin

between his shoulders crawled curiously
he swung himself into the abyss and felt
the clinging blackness swallow him

  groping downward he felt his feet
slip and stumble on steps too small for
human feet with one hand pressed hard
against the side of the well he steadied
himself fearing a fall into unknown and
unlighted depths the steps were cut
into solid rock yet they were greatly worn
away the farther he progressed the less
like steps they became mere bumps of
worn stone then the direction of the shaft
changed sharply it still led down but at
a shallow slant down which he could
walk elbows braced against the hollowed
sides head bent low beneath the curved
roof the steps had ceased altogether and
the stone felt slimy to the touch like a
serpents lair what beings bran won-
dered had slithered up and down this
slanting shaft for how many centuries

  the tunnel narrowed until bran found
it rather difficult to shove through he
lay on his back and pushed himself along
with his hands feet first still he knew
he was sinking deeper and deeper into
the very guts of the earth how far below
the surface he was he dared not contem-
plate then ahead a faint witch-fire
gleam tinged the abysmal blackness he
grinned savagely and without mirth if
they he sought came suddenly upon him
how could he fight in that narrow shaft
but he had put the thought of personal
fear behind him when he began this hell-
ish quest he crawled on thoughtless of
all else but his goal

  and he came at last into a vast space
where he could stand upright he could
not see the roof of the place but he got
an impression of dizzying vastness the
blackness pressed in on all sides and be-
hind him he could see the entrance to the
shaft from which he had just emerged-
a black well in the darkness but in front
worms of the earth



of him a strange grisly radiance glowed
about a grim altar built of human skulls
the source of that light he could not de-
termine but on the altar lay a sullen
night-black object-the black stone

  bran wasted no time in giving thanks
that the guardians of the grim relic were
nowhere near he caught up the stone
and gripping it under his left arm
crawled into the shaft when a man
turns his back on peril its clammy menace
looms more grisly than when he advances
upon it so bran crawling back up the
nighted shaft with his grisly prize felt the
darkness turn on him and slink behind
him grinning with dripping fangs
clammy sweat beaded his flesh and he
hastened to the best of his ability ears
strained for some stealthy sound to betray
that fell shapes were at his heels strong
shudders shook him despite himself and
the short hair on his neck prickled as if
a cold wind blew at his back

  when he reached the first of the tiny
steps he felt as if he had attained to the
outer boundaries of the mortal world up
them he went stumbling and slipping
and with a deep gasp of relief came out
into the tomb whose spectral grayness
seemed like the blaze of noon in compar-
ison to the stygian depths he had just tra-
versed he replaced the central stone and
strode into the light of the outer day and
never was the cold yellow light of the sun
more grateful as it dispelled the shadows
of black-winged nightmares of fear and
madness that seemed to have ridden him
up out of the black deeps he shoved the
great blocking stone back into place and
picking up the cloak he had left at the
mouth of the tomb he wrapped it about
the black stone and hurried away a
strong revulsion and loathing shaking his
soul and lending wings to his strides

  a gray silence brooded over the land
it was desolate as the blind side of the

moon yet bran felt the potentialities of
life-under his feet in the brown earth
-sleeping but how soon to waken and
in what horrific fashion

  he came through the tall masking
reeds to the still deep men called dagons
mere no slightest ripple ruffled the cold
blue water to give evidence of the grisly
monster legend said dwelt beneath bran
closely scanned the breathless landscape
he saw no hint of life human or unhu-
man he sought the instincts of his sav-
age soul to know if any unseen eyes fixed
their lethal gaze upon him and found no
response he was alone as if he were the
last man alive on earth

  swiftly he unwrapped the black stone
and as it lay in his hands like a solid sul-
len block of darkness he did not seek to
learn the secret of its material nor scan
the cryptic characters carved thereon
weighing it in his hands and calculating
the distance he flung it far out so that it
fell almost exactly in the middle of the
lake a sullen splash and the waters
closed over it there was a moment of
shimmering flashes on the bosom of the
lake then the blue surface stretched plac-
id and unrippled again



the were-woman turned swiftly as
bran approached her door her
slant eyes widened

  you and alive and sane

  i have been into hell and i have re-
turned he growled what is more i
have that which i sought

  the black stone she cried you
really dared steal it where is it

  no matter but last night my stallion
screamed in his stall and i heard some-
thing crunch beneath his thundering
hoofs which was not the wall qf the
stable-and there was blood on his hoofs
when i came to see and blood on the


weird tales

floor of the stall and i have heard
stealthy sounds in the night and noises
beneath my dirt floor as if worms bur-
rowed deep in the earth they know i
have stolen their stone have you be-
trayed me

  she shook her head

  i keep your secret they do not need
my word to know you the farther they
have retreated from the world of men the
greater have grown their powers in other
uncanny ways some dawn your hut will
stand empty and if men dare investigate
they will find nothing-except crumbling
bits of earth on the dirt floor

  bran smiled terribly

  i have not planned and toiled thus far
to fall prey to the talons of vermin if
they strike me down in the night they
will never know what became of their
idol-or whatever it be to them i would
speak with them

  dare you come with me and meet
them in the night she asked

  thunder of all gods he snarled
who are you to ask me if i dare lead
me to them and let me bargain for a ven-
geance this night the hour of retribu-
tion draws nigh this day i saw silvered
helmets and bright shields gleam across
the fens - the new commander has ar-
rived at the tower of trajan and caius
camillus has marched to the wall

that night the king went across the
dark desolation of the moors with
the silent were-woman the night was
thick and still as if the land lay in ancient
slumber the stars blinked vaguely mere
points of red struggling through the un-
breathing gloom their gleam was dim-
mer than the glitter in the eyes of the
woman who glided beside the king
strange thoughts shook bran vague ti-
tanic primeval tonight ancestral link-
ings with these slumbering fens stirred in
his soul and troubled him with the fan-

tasmal eon-veiled shapes of monstrous
dreams the vast age of his race was
borne upon him where now he walked
an outlaw and an alien dark-eyed kings
in whose mold he was cast had reigned
in old times the celtic and roman in-
vaders were as strangers to this ancient
isle beside his people yet his race like-
wise had been invaders and there was an
older race than his-a race whose begin-
nings lay lost and hidden back beyond the
dark oblivion of antiquity

  ahead of them loomed a low range of
hills which formed the easternmost ex-
tremity of those straying chains which far
away climbed at last to the mountains of
wales the woman led the way up what
might have been a sheep-path and halted
before a wide black gaping cave

  a door to those you seek oh king
her laughter rang hateful in the gloom
dare ye enter

  his fingers closed in her tangled locks
and he shook her viciously

  ask me but once more if i dare he
grated and your head and shoulders part
company lead on

  her laughter was like sweet deadly
venom they passed into the cave and
bran struck flint and steel the flicker of
the tinder showed him a wide dusty cav-
ern on the roof of which hung clusters of
bats lighting a torch he lifted it and
scanned the shadowy recesses seeing noth-
ing but dust and emptiness

  where are they he growled

  she beckoned him to the back of the
cave and leaned against the rough wall
as if casually but the kings keen eyes
caught the motion of her hand pressing
hard against a projecting ledge he re-
coiled as a round black well gaped sud-
denly at his feet again her laughter
slashed him like a keen silver knife he
held the torch to the opening and again
saw small worn steps leading down
worms of the earth



  they do not need those steps said
atla once they did before your people
drove them into the darkness but you
will need them

   she thrust the torch into a niche above
the well it shed a faint red light into the
darkness below she gestured into the
well and bran loosened his sword and
stepped into the shaft as he went down
into the mystery of the darkness the light
was blotted out above him and he
thought for an instant atla had covered
the opening again then he realized that
she was descending after him

the descent was not a long one
abruptly bran felt his feet on a solid
floor atla swung down beside him and
stood in the dim circle of light that drifted
down the shaft bran could not see the
limits of the place into which he had
come

   many caves in these hills said atla
her voice sounding small and strangely
brittle in the vastness are but doors to
greater caves which lie beneath even as a
mans words and deeds are but small in-
dications of the dark caverns of murky
thought lying behind and beneath

  and now bran was aware of movement
in the gloom the darkness was filled
with stealthy noises not like those made by
any human foot abruptly sparks began
to flash and float in the blackness like
flickering fireflies closer they came
until they girdled him in a wide half-
moon and beyond the ring gleamed
other sparks a solid sea of them fading
away in the gloom until the farthest were
mere tiny pin-points of light and bran
knew they were the slanted eyes of the
beings who had come upon him in such
numbers that his brain reeled at the con-
templation-and at the vastness of the
cavern

  now that he faced his ancient foes
bran knew no fear he felt the waves of

terrible menace emanating from them the
grisly hate the inhuman threat to body
mind and soul more than a member of
a less ancient race he realized the horror
of his position but he did not fear
though he confronted the ultimate horror
of the dreams and legends of his race
his blood raced fiercely but it was with
the hot excitement of the hazard not the
drive of terror

  they know you have the stone oh
king said atla and though he knew
she feared though he felt her physical
efforts to control her trembling limbs
there was no quiver of fright in her voice
you are in deadly peril they know your
breed of old - oh they remember the
days when their ancestors were men i
can not save you both of us will die as no
human has died for ten centuries speak
to them if you will they can understand
your speech though you may not under-
stand theirs but it will avail not-you
are human-and a piet

  bran laughed and the closing ring of
fire shrank back at the savagery in his
laughter drawing his sword with a soul-
chilling rasp of steel he set his back
against what he hoped was a solid stone
wall facing the glittering eyes with his
sword gripped in his right hand and his
dirk in his left he laughed as a blood-
hungry wolf snarls

  aye he growled i am a piet a son
of those warriors who drove your brutish
ancestors before them like chaff before the
storm-who flooded the land with your
blood and heaped high your skulls for a
sacrifice to the moon-woman you who
fled of old before my race dare ye now
snarl at your master roll on me like a
flood now if ye dare before your viper
fangs drink my life i will reap your mul-
titudes like ripened barley-of your sev-
ered heads will i build a tower and of
your mangled corpses will i rear up a


weird tales

wall dogs of the dark vermin of hell
worms of the earth rush in and try my
steel when death finds me in this dark
cavern your living will howl for the
scores of your dead and your black stone
will be lost to you for ever-for only i
know where it is hidden and not all the
tortures of all the hells can wring the
secret from my lips

  then followed a tense silence bran
faced the fire-lit darkness tensed like a
wolf at bay waiting the charge at his side
the woman cowered her eyes ablaze
then from the silent ring that hovered
beyond the dim torchlight rose a vague
abhorrent murmur bran prepared as he
was for anything started gods was that
the speech of creatures which had once
been called men

  atla straightened listening intently
from her lips came the same hideous soft
sibilances and bran though he had al-
ready known the grisly secret of her being
knew that never again could he touch her
save with soul-shaken loathing

  she turned to him a strange smile curv-
ing her red lips dimly in the ghostly light

  they fear you oh king by the black
secrets of rlyeh who are you that hell
itself quails before you not your steel
but the stark ferocity of your soul has
driven unused fear into their strange
minds they will buy back the black
stone at any price

  good bran sheathed his weapons
they shall promise not to molest you be-
cause of your aid of me and his voice
hummed like the purr of a hunting tiger
they shall deliver into my hands titus
sulla governor of ebbracum now com-
manding the tower of trajan this they
can do-how i know not but i know
that in the old days when my people
warred with these children of the night
babes disappeared from guarded huts and

none saw the stealers come or go do
they understand

  again rose the low frightful sounds
and bran who feared not their wrath
shuddered at their voices

  they understand said atla bring
the black stone to dagons ring tomor-
row night when the earth is veiled with
the blackness that foreruns the dawn
lay the stone on the altar there they
will bring titus sulla to you trust
them they have not interfered in hu-
man affairs for many centuries but they
will keep their word

  bran nodded and turning climbed up
the stair with atla close behind him at
the top he turned and looked down once
more as far as he could see floated a
glittering ocean of slanted yellow eyes up-
turned but the ovners of those eyes
kept carefully beyond the dim circle of
torchlight and of their bodies he could
see nothing their low hissing speech
floated up to him and he shuddered as his
imagination visualized not a throng of
biped creatures but a swarming swaying
myriad of serpents gazing up at him with
their glittering unwinking eyes

  he swung into the upper cave and atla
thrust the blocking stone bade in place
it fitted into the entrance of the well with
uncanny precision bran was unable to dis-
cern any crack in the apparently solid floor
of the cavern atla made a motion to ex-
tinguish the torch but the king stayed
her

  keep it so until we are out of the
cave he grunted we might tread on
an adder in the dark

  atlas sweetly hateful laughter rose
maddeningly in the flickering gloom



it was not long before sunset when
bran came again to the reed-grown
marge of dagons mere casting cloak
worms of the earth



and sword-belt on the ground he stripped
himself of his short leathern breeches
then gripping his naked dirk in his teeth
he went into the water with the smooth
ease of a diving seal swimming strong-
ly he gained the center of the small lake
and turning drove himself downward

  the mere was deeper than he had
thought it seemed he would never reach
the bottom and when he did his grop-
ing hands failed to find what he sought
a roaring in his ears warned him and he
swam to the surface

  gulping deep of the refreshing air he
dived again and again his quest was
fruitless a third time he sought the
depth and this time his groping hands
met a familiar object in the silt of the
bottom grasping it he swam up to the
surface

  the stone was not particularly bulky
but it was heavy he swam leisurely and
suddenly was aware of a curious stir in
the waters about him which was not
caused by his own exertions thrusting
his face below the surface he tried to
pierce the blue depths with his eyes and
thought to see a dim gigantic shadow
hovering there

  he swam faster not frightened but
wary his feet struck the shallows and
he waded up on the shelving shore
looking back he saw the waters swirl and
subside he shook his head swearing
he had discounted the ancient legend
which made dagons mere the lair of a
nameless water-monster but now he had
a feeling as if his escape had been nar-
row the time-worn myths of the ancient
land were taking form and coming to life
before his eyes what primeval shape
lurked below the surface of that treacher-
ous mere bran could not guess but he
felt that the fenmen had good reason for
shunning the spot after all

  bran donned his garments mounted

the black stallion and rode across the fens
in the desolate crimson of the sunsets
afterglow with the black stone wrapped
in his cloak he rode not to his hut but
to the west in the direction of the tower
of trajan and the ring of dagon as
he covered the miles that lay between the
red stars winked out midnight passed
him in the moonless night and still bran
rode on his heart was hot for his meet-
ing with titus sulla atla had gloated
over the anticipation of watching the ro-
man writhe under torture but no such
thought was in the piets mind the gov-
ernor should have his chance with weap-
ons-with brans own sword he should
face the pictish kings dirk and live or
die according to his prowess and
thcugh sulla was famed throughout the
provinces as a swordsman bran felt no
doubt as to the outcome

  dagons ring lay some distance from
the tower-a sullen circle of tall gaunt
stones planted upright with a rough-hewn
stone altar in the center the romans
looked on these menhirs with aversion
they thought the druids had reared them
but the celts supposed brans people the
piets had planted them-and bran well
knew what hands reared those grim mon-
oliths in lost ages though for what rea-
sons he but dimly guessed

  the king did not ride straight to the
ring he was consumed with curiosity as
to how his grim allies intended carrying
out their promise that they could
snatch titus sulla from the very midst of
his men he felt sure and he believed he
knew how they would do it he felt the
gnawings of a strange misgiving as if he
had tampered with powers of unknown
breadth and depth and had loosed forces
which he could not control each time
he remembered that reptilian murmur
those slanted eyes of the night before a
cold breath passed over him they had


weird tales

been abhorrent enough when his people
drove them into the caverns under the
hills ages ago what had long centuries
of retrogression made of them in their
nighted subterranean life had they re-
tained any of the attributes of humanity at
all

  some instinct prompted him to ride
toward the tower he knew he was near
but for the thick darkness he could have
plainly seen its stark outline tusking the
horizon even now he should be able to
make it out dimly an obscure shudder-
some premonition shook him and he
spurred the stallion into swift canter

  and suddenly bran staggered in his
saddle as from a physical impact so stun-
ning was the surprize of what met his
gaze the impregnable tower of trajan
was no more brans astounded gaze rest-
ed on a gigantic pile of ruins-of shat-
tered stone and crumbled granite from
which jutted the jagged and splintered
ends of broken beams at one corner
of the tumbled heap one tower rose out of
the waste of crumpled masonry and it
leaned drunkenly as if its foundations had
been half cut away

bran dismounted and walked forward
dazed by bewilderment the moat
was filled in places by fallen stones and
broken pieces of mortared wall he
crossed over and came among the ruins
where he knew only a few hours before
the flags had resounded to the martial
tramp of iron-clad feet and the walls had
echoed to the clang of shields and the
blast of the loud-throated trumpets a hor-
rific silence reigned

  almost under brans feet a broken
shape writhed and groaned the king
bent down to the legionary who lay in a
sticky red pool of his own blood a
single glance showed the piet that the

man horribly crushed and shattered was
dying

  lifting the bloody head bran placed
his flask to the pulped lips and the roman
instinctively drank deep gulping through
splintered teeth in the dim starlight
bran saw his glazed eyes roll

  the walls fell muttered the dying
man they crashed down like the
skies falling on the day of doom ah
jove the skies rained shards of granite
and hailstones of marble

  i have felt no earthouake shock
bran scowled puzzled

  it was no earthquake muttered the
roman before last dawn it began the
faint dim scratching and clawing far be-
low the earth we of the guard heard
it-like rats burrowing or like worms
hollowing out the earth titus laughed
at us but all day long we heard it then
at midnight the tower quivered and
seemed to settle-as if the foundations
were being dug away---

  a shudder shook bran mak mom
the worms of the earth thousands of
vermin digging like moles far below the
castle burrowing away the foundations-
gods the land must be honeycombed with
tunnels and caverns-these creatures were
even less human than he had thought-
what ghastly shapes of darkness had he
invoked to his aid

  what of titus sulla he asked
again holding the flask to the legionarys
lips in that moment the dying roman
seemed to him almost like a brother

  even as the tower shuddered we
heard a fearful scream from the gover-
nors chamber muttered the soldier
we rushed there-as we broke down the
door we heard his shrieks-they seemed
to recede-into the bowels of the earth
we rushed in the chamber was empty
his blood-stained sword lay on the floor
in the stone flags of the floor a black hole
worms of the earth



gaped then-the-towers-reeled-the
-roof-broke-through-a-storm-

of-crashing-walls-i-crawled-

  a strong convulsion shook the broken
figure

  lay me down friend whispered the
roman i die

  he had ceased to breathe before bran
could comply the piet rose mechan-
ically cleansing his hands he hastened
from the spot and as he galloped over the
darkened fens the weight of the accursed
black stone under his cloak was as the
weight of a foul nightmare on a mortal
breast

  as he approached the ring he saw an
eery glow within so that the gaunt stones
stood etched like the ribs of a skeleton in
which a witch-fire burns the stallion
snorted and reared as bran tied him to
one of the menhirs carrying the stone
he strode into the grisly circle and saw
atla standing beside the altar one hand
on her hip her sinuous body swaying in a
serpentine manner the altar glowed ali
over with ghastly light and bran knew
some one probably atla had rubbed it
with phosphorus from some dank swamp
or quagmire

  he strode forward and whipping his
cloak from about the stone flung the ac-
cursed thing on to the altar

  i have fulfilled my part of the con-
tract he growled

  and they theirs she retorted
look-they come

  he wheeled his hand instinctively
dropping to his sword outside the ring
the great stallion screamed savagely and
reared against his tether the night wind
moaned through the waving grass and an
abhorrent soft hissing mingled with it
between the menhirs flowed a dark tide
of shadows unstable and chaotic the
ring filled with glittering eyes which
hovered beyond the dim illusive circle of

illumination cast by the phosphorescent
altar somewhere in the darkness a hu-
man voice tittered and gibbered idiotical-
ly bran stiffened the shadows of a hor-
ror clawing at his soul

   he strained his eyes trying to make out
the shapes of those who ringed him but
he glimpsed only billowing masses of
shadow which heaved and writhed and
squirmed with almost fluid consistency

  let them make good their bargain
he exclaimed angrily

  then see oh king cried atla in a
voice of piercing mockery

there was a stir a seething in the
writhing shadows and from the
darkness crept like a four-legged animal
a human shape that fell down and grov-
eled at brans feet and writhed and
mowed and lifting a deaths-head
howled like a dying dog in the ghastly
light bran soul-shaken saw the blank
glassy eyes the bloodless features the
loose writhing froth-covered lips of
sheer lunacy-gods was this titus sulla
the proud lord of life and death in ebbra-
cums proud city

  bran bared his sword

  i had thought to give this stroke in
vcngeance he said somberly i give it
ir mercy-vale ccesar

   the steel flashed in the eery light and
sullas head rolled to the foot of the glow-
ing aitar where it lay staring up at the
shaciowed sky

  they harmed him not atlas hateful
laugh slashed the sick silence it was
what he saw and came to know that broke
his brain like all his heavy-footed race
he knew nothing of the secrets of this
ancient land this night he has been
dragged through the deepest pits of hell
where even you might have blenched

  well for the romans that they know
not the secrets of this accursed land


weird tales

bran roared maddened with its mon-
ster-haunted meres its foul witch-women
and its lost caverns and subterranean
realms where spawn in the darkness
shapes of hell

  are they more foul than a mortal who
seeks their aid cried atla with a shriek
of fearful mirth give them their black
stone

  a cataclysmic loathing shook brans
soul with red fury

  aye take your cursed stone he
roared snatching it from the altar and
dashing it among the shadows with such
savagery that bones snapped under its im-
pact a hurried babel of grisly tongues
rose and the shadows heaved in turmoil
one segment of the mass detached itself
for an instant and bran cried out in fierce
revulsion though he caught only a fleet-
ing glimpse of the thing had only a brief
impression of a broad strangely flattened
head pendulous writhing lips that bared
curved pointed fangs and a hideously
misshapen dwarfish body that seemed
mottled-all set off by those unwinking
reptilian eyes gods-the myths had
prepared him for horror in human aspect
horror induced by bestial visage and
stunted deformity-but this was the hor-
ror of nightmare and the night

  go back to hell and take your idol
with you he yelled brandishing his
clenched fists to the skies as the thick
shadows receded flowing back and away
from him like the foul waters of some
black flood your ancestors were men
though strange and monstrous-but gods

  ye have become in ghastly fact what my
people called ye in scorn worms of the

  he sprang from the ring as a man flees
the touch of a coiling snake and tore the
stallion free at his elbow atla was
shrieking with fearful laughter all human
attributes dropped from her like a cloak
in the night

  king of pictland she cried king

thing stay and let me show you real
fruits of the pits ha ha ha run
fool run but you are stained with the
taint - you have called them forth and
they will remember and in their own
time they will come to you again

  he yelled a wordless curse and struck
her savagely in the mouth with his open
hand she staggered blood starting from
her lips but her fiendish laughter only
rose higher

  bran leaped into the saddle wild for
the clean heather and the cold blue hills
of the north where he could plunge his
sword into clean slaughter and his sick-
ened soul into the red maelstrom of bat-
tle and forget the horror which lurked
below the fens of the west he gave the
frantic stallion the rein and rode through
the night like a hunted ghost until the
hellish laughter of the howling were-

weird tales

ishly small feet toward the fire and regard-
ed the gleaming tips of his patent leather
pumps with every evidence of satisfaction
tiens friend trowbridge he remarked
lazily as he watched the leaping firelight
quicken in reflection on his polished
shoes this is most entirely pleasant me
not for anything would i leave the house
on such a night he is a fool who quits
his cheerful fire to-

  the sharp peremptory clatter of the
front door knocker battered through his
words and before i could hoist myself
from my chair the summons was repeated
louder more insistently

  i say doctor trowbridge will you
come over to larsons im afraid some-
things happened to him-i hate to drag
you out on such a night but i think he

really needs a doctor and- young

professor ellis half staggered into the hall
as the driving wind thrust him almost
bodily across the doorstep

  i ran over to see him a few minutes
ago he added as i slammed the door
against the storm and as i went up his
front path i noticed a light burning in an
upper window though the rest of the
house was dark i knocked but got no
answer then went into the yard to call to
him when all of a sudden i heard him
give the most go-awful yell followed
by a shriek of laughter and as i looked
up at his window he seemed to be strug-
gling with something though there was
no one else in the room i rang his bell
a dozen times and pounded on the door
but not another sound came from the
house at first i thought of notifying the
police then i remembered you lived just
round the corner so i came here instead
if larsons been taken ill you can help
if we need the police theres always time
to call em so-

  eh bien my friends why do we stand
here talking while the poor professor lar-

son is in need of help demanded jules
de grandin from the study door have
you no professional pride friend trow-
bridge why do we linger here

  why youve only finished saying you
wouldnt budge from the house tonight

i retorted accusingly do you mean-

  but certainly i do he interrupted
only two kinds of people can not change
their minds my friend the foolish and
the dead jules de grandin is neither
come let us go

  no use getting out the car i mur-
mured as we donned our overcoats this
sleet would make driving impossible
very well then let us walk but let
us be about it swiftly he responded fair-
ly pushing me through the door and out
into the raging night heads bent against
the howling storm we set out for pro-
fessor larsons house

t didnt exactly have an engagement
a with larson professor ellis admit-
ted as we trudged along the street fact
is i expect hed about as soon have seen
the devil as me but-have you heard
about his latest mummy he broke off
his what i answered sharply

  his mummy he brought it in from
africa last week and hes been talking
about it ever since this evening he was
going to remove the wrappings so i just
ambled over to his house on the off chance
hed let me stick around

  larsons a queer chap good man in
anthropology and all that of course but
a lone wolf when it comes to work he
found this mummy by accident in a clever-
ly hidden tomb near naga-ed-der and that
country was given up as thoroughly
worked out thirty years ago you know
funny thing about it too- while they
were excavating the sepulcher two of his
workmen were bitten by tomb spiders and
died in convulsions thats unusual for
the bleeding mummy



the egyptian tomb spiders not particular-
ly venomous though hes an ugly-looking
brute theyd just about cleared the shaft
of rubble and started working toward the
funerary chamber when all larsons fella-
heen ran out on him too but hes a stub-
born devil and he and foster stuck it out
with the help of such men as they could
hire in the neighborhood

  they had the devil of a time getting
the mummy down the nile too half the
crew of their dehabeeyah came down with
some mysterious fever and several of em
died and the rest deserted and just as
they were ready to sail from alexandria
foster who was larsons assistant came
down with fever and died within three
days larson hung on like grim death
though and brought the mummy through
-smuggled it right past the egyptian
customs men disguised as a crate of
smyrna sponges

  but see here i interrupted both you
and professor larson are members of the
harrisonville museum staff how does it
happen hes able to treat this mummy as
his personal property why didnt he
take it to the museum instead of his
house

  ellis gave a short laugh dont know
larson very well do you he asked
didnt i say hes a lone wolf this ex-
pedition to naga-ed-der was a fifty-fifty
affair the museum paid half the shot
and larson just about beggared himself
to make up the difference he had a
theory there were some valuable fifth
dynasty relics to be found at naga and
everybody laughed at him when hed
justified his theory he was like a spoiled
kid with a stick of candy and wouldnt
share his find with any one when i sug-
gested he let me help him unwrap the
thing he told me to take a running jump
in the lake i hadnt an idea really hed
let me in when i called on him tonight

but when i heard him yelling and laugh-
ing and saw him jumping around like a
chestnut on a griddle i thought maybe
hed gone off his rocker and ran to get
you as quickly as i could here we are
well probably be told to go to hell for
our trouble but he might need help

  as he finished speaking ellis sounded
a thunderous knock on larsons door
only the skirling of the wind around the
angle of the house and the flapping of an
unsecured window-blind responded

  pardieu either he is gravely ill or
most abominably deaf that one declared
de grandin sinking his chin in the fur
collar of his coat and grasping at his hat as
the storm-wind all but wrenched it from
his head

  ellis turned to us in indecision dye
think- he began but

  think what you please my friends
and freeze your feet while doing the
little frenchman interrupted testily me
i go into that house right away imme-
diately this minute trying the door
and nearest window and finding both
securely fastened he dashed his gloved
hand through the pane without more ado
undid the latch and raised the sash do
you follow or remain behind to perish
miserably with cold he called as he flung
a leg across the sill

de grandin in the lead we felt our
way across the darkened drawing-
room across the hall and up the winding
staircase every room inside the house
save one was black as ancient egypt dur-
ing the plague of darkness but a thin
stream of light trickling out into the hall
from beneath professor larsons study
door led our footsteps toward his sanctum
as a lighthouse guides a ship to port upon
a starless night larson ellis called
softly rapping on the study door lar-
son are you there


weird tales

  no answer came and he seized the
door-knob giving it a tentative twist the
handle turned in his grasp but the door
held firm for the lock had been shot
from the inside

  one side if you will be so kind mon-
sieur requested jules de grandin draw-
ing as far back as the width of the hall
permitted then dashing himself forward
like a football player battering toward the
goal the flimsy door fell before his rush
and the darkened hall was flooded with a
freshet of dazzling light for a moment
we paused on the threshold blinking
owlishly then

  good heavens i exclaimed

  for gawds sake came ellis re-
joinder

  eh bien i rather think it is the
devils jules de grandin murmured

  the room before us was a chaos of con-
fusion as though its contents had been
stirred with a monster spoon in the hands
of a maliciously mischievous giant fur-
niture was overturned some of the chair
covers had been ripped open as though a
ruthless hurrying searcher had cut the
upholstery in search of hidden valuables
pictures hung crazily upon the walls

  in the middle of the study beneath the
glare of a cluster of electric lights stood
a heavy oaken table and on it lay a
mummy-case stripped of its cover a slen-
der china-tea-colored form swathed in
crisscrossed linen bandages reclining on
the table by the case

  close to the baseboard of the wall be-
neath the window crouched a grotesque
unhuman thing resembling a farmers
cast-off scarecrow or a hopelessly out-
moded tailors dummy we had to look a
second time and strain our unbelieving
eyes before we recognized professor lar-
son in the crumpled form

  stepping daintily as a cat on a shower-
splashed pavement de grandin crossed

the room and sank to one knee beside the
huddled form drawing his right glove
off as he knelt

  is-is he- ellis whispered

hoarsely halting at the word of which
laymen seem to have a superstitious fear

  dead de grandin supplied mais
out monsieur like a herring but he has
not been so long no i should hazard
a guess that he was still living when ve
left the house to come here

  but-isnt there something we can

do there must be something--

ellis asked tremulously

   but certainly we can call the coroner
de grandin answered meanwhile we
might examine this he nodded toward
the mummy lying on the table

   ellis humane concern for his dead col-
league dropped from him like a worn-out
garment as he turned toward the ancient
relic the man eclipsed completely by the
anthropologist beautiful-superb he
murmured ecstatically as he gazed at the
unlovely tiling see theres no face-mask
or funerary statue either on the mummy
or the case fifth dynasty work as sure
as youre alive and the case is-i say do
you see it he broke off pointing excited-
ly at the open cedar coffin

  see it but certainly de grandin
answered sharply but what is it you
find extraordinary if one may ask
why dont you see theres not a
line of writing on that mummy-case the
egyptians always wrote the titles and bi-
ographies of the dead upon their coffins
but this one is just bare virgin wood
see-he leant over and tapped the thin
hard shell of cedar-theres never been a
bit of paint or varnish on it no wonder
larson kept it to himself why theres
never been a thing like this discovered
since egyptology became a science

  de grandins glance had wandered
from the coffin to the mummy now he
the bleeding mummy



brushed past ellis with his quick cat-like
step and bent above the bandaged form
the egyptologie i do not know so well
he admitted but medicine i know per-
fectly what do you make of this hein
his slender forefinger rested for a mo-
ment on the linen bands encircling the
desiccated figures left pectoral region

  i started at the words there was no
doubt about it the left breast even be-
neath the mummy-bands was consider-
ably lower than the right and faintly but
perceptibly through the tightly bound
linen there showed the faintest trace of
brown-red stain there was no mistak-
ing it every surgeon soldier and em-
balmer knows that telltale stain at sight

  professor ellis eyes opened till they
were nearly as wide as de grandins
blood he exclaimed in a muted voice
good lord then

   but it cant be blood it simply cant
you know mummies were eviscerated
and pickled in natron before desiccation
theres no possibility of any blood being

left in the body-

  oh no the frenchmans interrup-
tion was charged with sarcasm never-
theless monsieur de grandin is too old
a fox to be instructed in the art of suck-
ing eggs friend trowbridge - he
turned to me-how long have you been
dealing pills to those afflicted with belly-
ache

  why i answered wonderingly

about forty years but-

  no buts my friend can you or can
you not recognize a blood-stain when you
see it

  of course but-

   what then is this if you will kindly
tell us

  why blood of course any one can

tell that-

  precisement-it is blood monsieur
ellis the good and most reliable doc-

tor trowbridge corroborates me now
let us examine the coffin of this so remark-
able mummy which despite your pickling
in natron and your desiccation can still
shed blood with a wave of his hand
he indicated the case of plain unvar-
nished cedar-wood

  by george this is unusual too
ellis cried bending above the coffin
dye see

  what i queried for his eyes were
shining with excitement as he gazed into
the violated casket

  why the way thfc things fastened
most mummy-case lids are held in place
by four little flanges-two on each side-
which sink into mortises cut in the lower
section and held in place by hardwood
dowels this has eight three on each
side and one at each end hm they must
have wanted to make sure whoever was
put in there couldnt break loose and-
great scott will you look there excit-
edly he pointed to the bottom of the case

  once more i looked my wonderment
the abnormalities which struck his prac-
tised eye were quite invisible to me

  see how theyve lined the case with
spices ive opened several hundred
mummy-cases but i never saw that be-
fore

  as he had said the entire bottom of the
coffin was strewn with loose spices to a
depth of four inches or so the aromat-
ics had crumbled to a fine powder but the
mingled clove and cinnamon aloes and
thyme gave off a pungent almost suffo-
cating aroma as we bent above the bath-
tub-like coffin

de grandins small blue eyes were
very round and bright as he glanced
quickly from me to ellis then back again
i damn think this explains it he an-
nounced unless i am much more mis-
taken than i think i am this body never


weird tales

was a mummy at least not such a mummy
as the old embalmers customarily pro-
duced will you assist me he bowed
invitingly to ellis placing his hands be-
neath the mummys shoulders at the same
time

  take the feet if you please mon-
sieurhe bade and lift it gently-gent-
ly if you please-it must be put exactly
where it was until the coroner has viewed
the room

they raised the bandaged form six
inches or so above the table then set
it down again and astonishment was writ-
ten on their faces as they finished

  what is it i asked completely mys-
tified by their glances of mutual under-
standing

  it weighs- began de grandin

and

  sixty pounds at least completed
ellis

  well

   well be everlastingly consigned to
satans lowest subcellar rejoined the
little frenchman sharply it is not well
at all my friend it is completely other-
wise you know your physiology you
know that sixty percent or more of us is
water simply hao such as is found in
rivers and on the tables of americans in
lieu of decent wine mummification is
dehydration-the watery contents of the
body is removed and nothing left but bone
and desiccated flesh a scant forty per cent
of the bodys weight in life this body is
a small one in life it could have weighed
scarcely a hundred pounds yet-

  why then it must have been only
partly mummified i interrupted but he
cut in with

  or not at all my friend i damn
think that we shall find some interesting
disclosures when these wrappings are re-
moved a bleeding mummy and a mum-

my which weighs more than half its life-
time weight-yes the probabilities of a
surprize are great or i am more mistaken
than i think

  meantime he turned toward the
door there is the routine of the law to
be complied with the coroner must be
told of monsieur larsons death and there
is no need for us to burn these lights
while we are waiting

  bowing politely to us to precede him
he switched off the study lights before
closing the door and followed us to the
lower hall where the telephone was lo-
cated

t simply cant imagine how it hap-
-l pened professor ellis murmured
striding nervously across his late col-
leagues drawing-room while we waited
the advent of the coroner larson
seemed in the pink of condition this af-
ternoon and-good lord whats that
the sound of a terrific struggle like
that of two men locked in a death-grip
echoed through the quiet house

  thump - thumo - thump heavy
pounding footsteps banged upon the floor
above our heads then crash came a
smashing impact as of overturning furni-
ture a momentary pause a strident scream
and the sudden crescendo of a wild dis-
cordant laugh then silence once again

  good heavens i exclaimed panic
grasping at my throat why its direct-
ly overhead-in the study where we left

the mummy and--

  impossible professor ellis contra-
dicted nobody could have gotten past

us to that room and-

  impossible or not friend trow-
bridge speaks the truth by damn the
little frenchman shouted springing from
his chair and racing toward the stairs
en avant mes enfants-follow me
three steps at a stride he mounted
the bleeding mummy



headlong up the stairway paused a mo-
ment at the closed door of the study while
he whipped a pistol from his pocket then
his weapon swinging in a circle before
him advanced with a quick leap snapped
on the lights and

  hands up he shouted warningly
a single offer of resistance and you
breakfast with the devil in the morning
-grand dieu my friends behold

  save that one or two chairs had been
overset the room was just as we had left
it upon the table lay the supine ban-
daged mummy its spice-filled case un-
covered by its side the thing which had
been larson crouched shoulders-to-the
wall as though stricken in an attempt to
turn a somersault the window-blind
flapped cracklingly in the chilling winter
wind

  the window-its open cried pro-
fessor ellis it was closed when we were
here but-

  dieu de dieu de dieu de dieu-does
not one know it de grandin interrupted
angrily striding toward the open case-
ment parbleu the way in which you
pounce upon the obvious is greatly trying
to my nerves friend ellis and-ah
a-a-a-ah one sees one perceives one
understands-almost

  abreast of him we gazed across the
sill and obedient to the mute command
of his pointing finger looked at the snow-
encrusted roof of the first floor bay-win-
dow which joined the house-wall some-
thing like two feet below the study
window gouged in the dead-white
veneer of snow were four long parallel
streaks exposing the slate beneath
um he murmured lowering the sash
and turning toward the door the mys-
tery is in part explained my friends

  that window it would be the logical
place for a burglar to force entry he
added as we trooped down the stairs

the roof of the bay-window has but very
little slope and stands directly under-
neath the window of professor larsons
study one bent on burglary could
hardly fail to note its possibilities as an
aid to crime and the fact that we had
light going only in the downstairs
room was notice to the world that the
upper story was untenanted so-

  quite so but there wasnt any burglar
there ellis interrupted practically

  de grandin favored him with such a
stare as a teacher might bestow on a more
than ordinarily dull pupil one quite
agrees mon ami he replied however
if you will have the exceeding goodness
to restrain your curiosity-and conversa-
tion-for a time it may be we shall find
that which we seek

  the dark hunched-up object showed
with startling vividness against the back-
ground of the snow-powdered lawn as we
descended from the porch de grandin
knelt beside it and struck a match to aid
in his inspection it was a ragged un-
kempt figure unwashed unshaven a
typical low-class sneak-thief who had
varied his customary sorry trade with an
excursion into the higher profession of
housebreaking with disastrous results to
himself he crouched as he had fallen
from the bay-windows sloping roof one
arm twisted underneath him his head
bent oddly to one side his battered age-
discolored hat mashed in at the crown
and driven comically down upon his head
till his ears were bent beneath it little
lodes of sleety snow had lodged within
the wrinkles of his ragged coat and tiny
threads of icicles had formed on his
mustache

  the man was dead no doubt of it no
one not even the most accomplished con-
tortionist could twist his neck at that
sharp angle and the manner of his
death was obvious frightened at sight


weird tales

of the mummy the poor fellow had en-
deavored to effect a hasty exit by the open
window had slipped upon the sleet-
glazed roof of the bay-window and fallen
to the ground striking head-first and
skidding forward with his full weight on
his twisted neck

   i voiced my conclusions hastily but de
grandin shook a puzzled head one
understands the manner of his death he
answered thoughtfully but the reason
that is something else again we can well
think diat such a creature would have a
paralyzing fear when he beheld the
mummy stretched upon the table but that
does not explain the antics he went
through before he fell or jumped back
through the window he had forced we
heard him thrash about we heard him
kick the furniture we heard him scream
with mirthless laughter for why
frightened men may scream they some-
times even laugh hysterically but what
was there for him to wrestle with
thats just what larson did pro-
fessor ellis put in hastily dont you re-
member-

  exactement the frenchman answered
with a puzzled frown professor lar-
son cries aloud and fights with nothing
this luckless burglar breaks into the very
room where monsieur larson died so
strange a death and he too wrestles with
the empty air and falls to death while
laughing hideously there is something
very devilish here my friends

when we had gone back in the house
young ellis looked at us with some-
thing very near to panic in his eyes you
say that we must leave that mummy as it
is until the coroner has seen it he de-
manded

  your understanding is correct my
friend de grandin answered

  all right well leave the dam thing

there but just as soon as mr martin has
finished with it i think wed better take
it out and burn it

  eh what is it that you say burn it
monsieur de grandin asked

  just that its what the egyptologists
call an unlucky mummy and the sooner
we get rid of it the healthier itll be for
all of us im thinking see here-he
glanced quickly upward as though fear-
ing a renewed outbreak in the room above
then turned again to us-do you recall
the series of fatalities following tutank-
hamens exhumation

  de grandin made no answer but the
fixed unwinking stare he leveled on the
speaker and the nervous way his trimly
waxed mustache quivered at the corners
of his mouth betrayed his interest

  ellis hurried on call it nonsense if
you will-and you probably will-but the
fact is there seems something in this talk
of the ancient gods of egypt having
power to curse those disturbing the mum-
mies of people dying in apostasy you
know i assume that there are certain
mummies known as unlucky--unlucky
for those who find them or have anything
to do with them tutankhamen is prob-
ably the latest as well as the most out-
standing example of this class he was a
heretic in his day and had offended the
old ones or their priests which amount-
ed to the same thing so when he died
they buried him with elaborate ceremo-
nies but set no image of amen-ra at the
bow of the boat which carried him across
the lake of the dead and the plaques of
tem seb nephthys osiris and isis were
not prepared to go with him into the
tomb tutankhamen notwithstanding his
belated efforts at reconciliation with the
priesthood was little better than an atheist
according to contemporary egyptian be-
lief and the wrath of the gods went into
the tomb with him it was not their wish
the bleeding mummy



that his name be preserved to posterity or
that any of his relics be brought to light
again

  now think what happened when
lord carnarvon located the tomb he had
four associates carnarvon and three of
his helpers are dead today colonel her-
bert and doctor evelyn-white vere
among the first to go into tuts tomb
both died within a year sir archibald
douglas was engaged to make an x-ray
-he died almost before the plates could
be developed six out of seven french
journalists who went into the tomb short-
ly after it was opened died in less than a
year and almost every workman engaged
in the excavations died before he had a
chance to spend his pay some of these
men died one way some another but the
point is they all died

  not only that even minor articles
taken from the tomb seem to exercise a
malign influence there is absolute proof
that attendants in the cairo museum
whose duties keep them near the tutank-
hamen relics sicken and die for no appar-
ent reason dye wonder they call him an
unlucky mummy

  very good monsieur what then de
grandin prompted as the other lapsed
into a moody silence

  just this that mummy-case upstairs
is bare of painting as the palm of your
hand and the orthodox egyptians of
the fifth dynasty would no more haye
thought of putting a body away without
suitable biographical and religious writ-
ings on the coffin than the average amer-
ican family today would think of holding
a funeral without religious services of
some sort further than that the evidence
points to that bodys never having been
embalmed at all-apparently it was mere-
ly wrapped and put into a coffin with a
layer of spices around it embalming had
religious significance in ancient egypt if

the flesh corrupted the spirit could not
return at the end of the prescribed cycle
and reanimate it and to be buried unem-
balmed was tantamount to a denial of
immortality this body had only the
poorest makeshift attempt at preservation
it looks as though this person whoever
he was died outside the religious pale
doesnt it

  you make out a strong case mon-
sieur de grandin nodded but-

   all right then look at the things his-
tory so far larsons workmen died while
working in the tomb  how by tomb-
spider bite

  bosh a tomb-spider is hardly more
poisonous than our own garden spiders
i know ive been bitten by the things and
suffered less inconvenience than when a
scorpion stung me in yucatan

  then on the passage down the nile
most of the boat crew sickened and some
of em died with a strange fever yet they
were hardy devils used to the climate and
in all probability immune to anything in
the way of illness the country could pro-
duce then foster larsons assistant
pegged out just as they were setting sail
from egypt looks as though some evil
influence were working doesnt it

  now tonight larson was all ready
to unwrap the mummy but never got past
taking it from the box hes dead-dead
like a herring as you put it-and only
god knows how he died right while
were waiting for the coroner to come
this poor devil of a burglar breaks into
the house fights with some unseen thing
just as larson did and dies say what
you will - his voice rose almost to a
scream-theres an aura of terrible mis-
fortune round that mummy and death is
waiting for whoever ventures near itj

  de grandin patted the waxed ends of
his diminutive mustache affectionately
what you say may all be true mon


weird tales

sieur he conceded but the fact remains
that both doctor trowbridge and i have
been near the mummy yet we were never
better in our lives-though i could do
nicely with a gulp or so of brandy at this
time not only that professor larson
spent nearly his entire fortune and a con-
siderable portion of the museums funds
in finding this so remarkable cadaver it
would be larceny no less for us to burn
it as you suggest

 all right ellis answered with a note
of finality in his voice have it your own
way as soon as the coroners through
with me im going home i wouldnt go
near that cursed mummy again for a for-
tune

ullo doctor de grandin cor-
oner martin greeted stamping his
feet and shaking the snow from his coat
bad business this isnt it any idea as
to the cause of death

  the one outside unquestionably died
from a broken neck the frenchman an-
swered as for professor larson-

eh the one outside mr martin in-
terrupted are there two of em
humph were lucky there arent five
ellis cut in bitterly they have been
dying so fast we cant keep track of em

since larson started to unwrap that-

  one moment if you please mon-
sieur de grandin interrupted as he
raised a deprecating hand monsieur the
coroner is a busy man and has his duties
to perform when they have been com-
pleted i make no doubt he will be glad
to listen to your interesting theories at
present-he bowed politely to the cor-
oner-will you come with us mon-
sieur he asked

  count me out said ellis ill wait
down here and i want to warn you

that-

  we never heard the warning he had for

us for de grandin in the lead we mount-
ed the stairs to the study where professor
larson and the mummy lay

  hm mr martin who in addition
to being coroner was also the citys lead-
ing funeral director surveyed the room
with a quick practised glance this looks

almost as if- he strode across the

room toward larsons hunched-up body
and extended one hand but

  grand dieu des cochons-stand back
monsieur de grandins shouted admo-
nition halted mr martin in mid-stride
back monsieur back friend trow-
bridge-for your lives snatching me
by the elbow and mr martin by the skirt
of his coat he fairly dragged us from the
room

  what on earth- i began as we

reached the hall but he pushed us toward
the stairway

  do not stand and parley he com-
manded shortly out-out into the
friendly cold while there is still time my
friends pardieu i see it now-monsieur
ellis has right that mummy-

  oh-oh-o-o-o-oh the sudden cry
came to us from the floor below followed
by the sound of scuffling as though ellis
and another were struggling madly then
came an awful marrow-freezing laugh
shrill mirthless sardonic

  sang du diable - it has him de
grandin shouted as he rushed madly
toward the stair leaped to the balustrade
and shot downward like a meteor

  coroner martin and i followed more
sedately and found the frenchman stand-
ing mute and breathless at the entrance of
the drawing-room his thin red lips
pursed as though emitting a soundless
whistle professor larsons parlor was
furnished in the formal stilted style so
popular in the late years of the last cen-
tury light chairs and couches of gilded
wood upholstered in apple-green satin a
the bleeding mummy



glass-doored cabinet for bric-a-brac a pair
of delicate spindle-legged tables adorned
with bits of dresden china the furni-
ture had been tossed about the room the
light-gray velvet rug turned up the china-
cabinet smashed and flung upon its side
in the midst of the confusion ellis lay
his hands clenched at his sides his knees
drawn up his lips retracted in a grim
sardonic grin

  good god coroner martin viewed
the poor tensed body with staring eyes

this is dreadful-

   cordieu it will be more so if we lin-
ger here de grandin cried outside
my friends do not wait to take your
coats or hats-come out at once i tell you
death is lurking in each shadow of this
cursed place

  he herded us before him from the
house and bade us stand a moment hat-
less and coatless in the chilling wind i
say i protested through chattering teeth
this is carrying a joke too far de gran-
din theres no need to-

  joke he echoed sharply do you
consider it a joke that professor larson
died the way he did tonight that the mis-
guided burglar perished in the same way
that even now the poor young ellis lies
all stiff and dead inside that cursed hell-
hole of a house your sense of humor is
peculiar my friend

  what was it coroner martin asked
practically was there some infection in
the house that made professor ellis scream

like that before he died or was it-

  tell me monsieur de grandin in-
terrupted have you facilities for fumiga-
tion at your mortuary

  of course the coroner returned
wonderingly weve apparatus for
making both formaldehyde and cyanogen
gas depending on the class of fumiga-
tion required but-

   very good be so good as to hasten to

your place of business and return as quick-
ly as may be with materiel for cyanogen
fumigation i shall await you here
make haste monsieur this matter is of
utmost urgency i assure you

while mr martin was obtaining the
apparatus for fumigation de gran-
din and i hastened to my house procured
fresh outdoor clothing and retraced our
steps though i made several attempts
to discover what he had found at larsons
his only answers were impatient shrugs
and half-articulate exclamations and i
finally gave over the attempt knowing he
would explain in detail when he thought
it proper hands deep in pockets heads
drawn well down into our collars we
waited for the coroners return

  with the deftness of long practise mr
martins assistants set the tanks of mer-
curic cyanide in place at the front and
back doors of the larson house ran rub-
ber hose from them to the keyholes and
lighted spirit lamps beneath them when
mr martin suggested that the bodies be
removed before fumigation began de
grandin shook his head decidedly it
would be death-or most unnecessary risk
of death at best-to permit your men to
enter till the gas has had at least a day to
work within the house he answered

  but those bodies should be cared for
the coroner contended speaking from the
professional knowledge of one who had
practised mortuary science for more than
twenty years

  they will undergo no putrefactive
changes worthy of account the french-
man answered the gas will act to some
extent as a preservative and the risk to
be avoided is worth the trouble

  as coroner martin was about to coun-
ter he continued demonstration out-
weighs explanation ten to one my friend
permit that i should have my way and by


weird tales

this time tomorrow night you will be con-
vinced of the good foundation for my
seeming stubbornness

shortly after eight oclock the follow-
ing evening we met once more at
larsons house and as calmly as though
such crazy actions were an everyday affair
with him de grandin smashed window
after window with his walking-stick and
bade us wait outside for upward of a
quarter-hour at last

   i think that it is safe to enter now he
said the gas should be dispelled
come let us go in

  we tiptoed down the hall to the draw-
ing-room where professor ellis lay and
de grandin turned on every available
light before entering the room beside
the young mans rigid body he went to his
knees and seemed to be examining the
floor with minutest care whatever are

you doing- i began when

  triomphe i have found him he an-
nounced come and see

  we crossed the room and stared in
wonder at the tiny object which he held
between the thumb and finger of his
gloved right hand it was a tiny ball-
like thing scarcely larger than a dried
bean a little hairy spider with a black
body striped about the abdomen with
lines of vivid vermilion you observe
him he asked simply was i not wise
to order our retreat last night

  what is the thing i demanded

its harmless-looking enough but-

   eh bien there is a very great but there
my friend he retorted with a mirthless
smile you saw what had been mon-
sieur larson you looked upon the poor
new-dead young ellis this-this little
seemingly so harmless thing it was which
killed them it is a katipo or latrodectus
nasselti the deadliest spider in the world
even the cobras bite is but a sweethearts
kiss beside the sting of this so small dead-

ly thing those bit by him are seized im-
mediately with convulsions-they beat the
air they stumble and they whirl at length
they give vent to a dreadful scream which
simulates a laugh and then they fall
and die

  does not that make it clear the
wholly irrational antics performed by pro-
fessor larson ere he died could be ex-
plained in no sane manner they puz-
zled me i was not willing to accept pro-
fessor ellis theory that the mummy was
unlucky although as the good god
knows it proved so for him however
that professor larson was entirely dead
could not be doubted nor could one read-
ily assign a reason for his death tiens
in such a case the coroner must be called
and so we telephoned for monsieur mar-
tin

  meantime as we sat waiting in this
room a poor half-starving devil of a man
decided he would break into the house and
steal whatever he could find he mount-
ed the bay-windows roof and guided by
his evil star set foot inside the chamber
where the mummy and professor larson
lay we heard him trample on the floor
we heard him give that dreadful laugh-
ing scream we searched for him and
found him dead upon the lawn

  very good in due time monsieur
martin comes we lead him to the place
where monsieur larson is and as we go
into the room i chance to look into the
spices strewn about the bottom of that
mummy-case ha-what is it that i see
parbleu i see a movement spices do not
move my friend except they be blown
on by the wind and there is no wind in
that room moreover spices are not jetty-
black with bands of red about their bel-
lies non pardieu but certain spiders
are i see him and i know him in the
eastern islands in java in australia i
have seen him and i have also seen his
the bleeding mummy



deadly work he is the latrodectus nas-
selti called katipo by the natives and his
bite is almost instant and most painful
death more those bitten by him dance
about insanely in a sort of frantic seizure
they laugh-but not with happiness-
they scream with mirthless laughter then
they die i did not wish to dance and
laugh and die my friends i did not wish
that you should do so either there was
no time for talk or explanation our only
safety lay in flight for they are tropic
things those spiders and once we were
outside the cold would kill them i was
about to call a warning to monsieur ellis
too but i was he las too late

  beyond a doubt one of the spiders had
fastened on his clothing while he bent
over to inspect that mummy-case the
insect clung to him when he left the room
and while he waited downstairs for us it
crawled until it came in contact with his
naked skin then angered it may be by
some movement which he made it bit him
and he died

  when i saw him lying here upon the
floor i took incontinently to flight jules
de grandin is no coward but who could
say how many of those cursed spiders had
crawled from the mummy-case and found
hiding-places in the shadows-even in
our clothing as in the case of monsieur
ellis to stay here was to court a quick
and highly disagreeable death according-
ly i rushed you out into the storm and
asked monsieur martin to provide fumi-
gation for the house forthwith now
since the cyanogen gas has killed every
living thing inside this house it is safe
for us to enter

  the bodies may safely be taken away
by your assistants at any time monsieur
he finished with a bow to mr martin

 m jh bien were he but here we could
joj set poor monsieur ellis mind at
rest concerning many things de gran-

din murmured as we drove toward my
house he could not understand how
professor larsons servants died by spi-
der-bite since the egyptian tomb-spider is
known to be innocuous or nearly so the
answer now is obvious in some way
which we do not understand a number
of those poisonous black spiders found
their way into that mummy-case they
are terrestrial in their habits living in the
earth and going forth by night light
irritates them and when the workmen
brought their torches into the tomb they
showed their annoyance by biting them
death accompanied by convulsions fol-
lowed and because the small black spi-
ders were invisible in the shadows the
harmless tomb-spiders received the blame
some few of the black spiders came over-
seas with professor larson when he
pried the lid from that mummy-case-
perhaps when he thrust his hand into the
scattered spices to lift the mummy out-
they fastened on him bit him killed him
you apprehend

  hm it sounds logical enough i
answered thoughtfully but have you any
idea how those spices carne in that coffin
poor ellis seemed to think wed hit on
something extraordinary when he saw
them but hes gone now and - great
scott de grandin dye suppose those old
egyptian priests could have planted spider
eggs among the spices hoping they would
hatch eventually so that whoever molest-
ed the body in years to come would stand
a chance of being bitten and killed

  for a moment he drummed soundless-
ly with gloved fingers on the silver head
of his stick at length my friend you
interest me he declared solemnly i
do not know that what you say is prob-
able but the manner of that mummys
preparation is unusual i think we owe it
as a debt to poor dead ellis to look into
the matter thoroughly


weird tales

 look into it how-

 tomorrow we shall unwrap the
body h responded as casually as though
unshrouding centuries-old dead egyptians
were an everyday activity with us if we
can find some explanation hidden in the
mummy-clothes well and good if we
do not-eh biert the dead have spoken
before why not again

  the-dead-have-spoken i echoed
slowly incredulously what in the

world-

  not in this world precisely he in-
terrupted with the shadow of a smile
but there are those who look behind the
veil which separates us from the ones we
call the dead my friend we shall try

other methods first those failing-

he recommenced his drumming on the
handle of his cane humming softly

          sucre de nom

             ron ron et ron

           la vie est breve

la nuit est longue-

next evening we unwrapped the
mummy

  it was an oddly assorted group which
gathered in the basement of harrison-
ville museum to denude the ancient dead
of its cerements hodgson the assistant
curator of the department of archeology a
slender little man in gold-bowed rimless
spectacles bald to the ears and much ad-
dicted to the habit of buttoning and un-
buttoning his primly untidy double-
breasted jacket stood by in state of twit-
tering nervousness as de grandin set to
work

  who sups with the devil needs a long
spoon the little frenchman quoted with
a smile as he drew a pair of heavy rubber
gloves on his hands before taking up his
scissors and snipping one of the criss-
crossed linen bands with which the body
was tightly wrapped i do not greatly fear
that any of those small black imps of hell

survived monsieur martins gas he
added laying back a fold of yellowed
linen but it is well to be prepared the
cemeteries are full to overflowing with
those who have thought otherwise

  yard after endless yard of linen he
reeled off coming at length to a strong
seamless shroud drawn sackwise over the
body and tied at the feet with a stout
cord the cloth of which the sack was
made seemed stronger and heavier than
the bandages and was thickly coated with
wax or some ceraceous substance the
whole being apparently airtight and
watertight

  why bless my soul i never saw any-
thing like this before stammered doctor
hodgson leaning forward across de gran-
dins shoulder to stare curiously at the
inner shroud

  so much we gathered from monsieur
ellis before-when he first viewed this
body de grandin answered dryly and
professor hodgson retreated with an odd
little squeaking exclamation for all the
world like that of an intimidated mouse

  sale lache the frenchman whispered
softly his contempt of hodgsons cow-
ardice written plainly on his face then
as he cut the binding string away and be-
gan twitching the waxed shroud upward
from the mummys shoulders

  ah ha ah-ha-ha-que diable

  the body brought to view beneath the
blue-white glare of the electric bulbs was
not technically a mummy though the
aromatic spices and the sterile arid atmos-
phere of egypt had combined to keep it in
a state of most unusual preservation the
feet first parts to be exposed were small
and beautifully formed with long
straight toes and narrow heels the digits
and soles as well as the whole plantar
region stained brilliant red there was
surprizingly little desiccation and though
the terminal tendons of the brevis digito-
the bleeding mummy



rum showed prominently through the
skin the effect was by no means revolt-
ing i had seen equal prominence of flex-
or muscles in living feet where the patient
had suffered considerable emaciation

  the ankles were sharp and shapely the
legs straight and well turned with the
leanness of youth rather than the wasted
look of death the hips were narrow the
waist slender and the gentle swelling
bosoms high and sharp making allow-
ance for the early age at which women of
the orient mature i should have said the
girl died somewhere in her middle teens
certainly well under twenty

  ah de grandin murmured as the
waxed sack slid over the bodys shoulders
i think that here we have the explana-
tion of those stains friend trowbridge
nest-ce-pas

  i looked and gulped back an exclama-
tion of horrified amazement the slim
tapering arms had been folded on the
breast in accordance with the egyptian
custom but the humerus of the left arm
had been cruelly crushed a compound
comminutive fracture having resulted so
that a quarter-inch or more of splintered
bone thrust through the skin above and
below the deltoid attachment not only
this the same blow which had crushed
the arm had smashed the bony structure
of the chest the third and fourth left ribs
being snapped in two and through the
smooth skin underneath the breast a prong
of jagged bone protruded a hemorrhage
of considerable extent had followed and
the long-dried blood lay upon the body
from left breast to hip in a dull brown-
red veneer waxed though the mummy-
sack had been the welling blood had
found its way through some break in the
coating had soaked the tightly knotted
outer bandages and borne mute testi-
mony of an ancient tragedy

   the finely cut features were those of a

woman in her early youth semitic in
their cast they had a delicacy of line and
contour which bespoke patrician breed-
ing the nose was small slightly aqui-
line high-bridged with narrow nostrils
the lips were thin and sensitive and
where they had retracted in the process of
partial desiccation showed small sharp
teeth of startling whiteness the hair was
black and lustrous cut short off at the ears
like the modern dutch bob affected by
young women parted in the middle and
bound about the brows with a circlet of
hammered gold set with small studs of
lapis lazuli for the rest a triple-stranded
necklace of gold and blue enamel armlets
of the same design and a narrow golden
girdle fashioned like a snake composed
the dead girls costume originally a full
plaited skirt of sheer white linen had been
appended to the girdle but the fragile
fabric had not withstood the years of wait-
ing in the grave and only one or two thin
wisps of it remained

  la pauvre exclaimed the french-
man gazing sadly at the broken little
body i think my friends that we see
here a demonstration of that ancient say-
ing that the blood of innocents can not be
concealed unless i am more wrong than

i admit this is a case of murder and-

   but it might as well have been an ac-
cident i cut in ive seen such injuries
in motor-wrecks and this poor child
might have been the victim of a chariot
smashup

   i do not think so he returned this
case has all the marks of ritual murder

my friend observe the-

   i think wecl better wrap the body up
again hodgson broke in hastily weve
gone as far as we can tonight and-well
im rather tired gentlemen and if you
dont mind well call the session off he
coughed apologetically but there was the
mild determination of weak men who


weird tales

have authority to make their wishes law
in his manner as he spoke

  you mean that youre afraid of some-
thing that might happen de grandin
countered bluntly you fear the ancient
gods may take offense at our remaining
here to speculate on the manner of this
poor ones death

  well hodgson took his glasses off
and wiped them nervously of course i
dont believe those stories that they tell of
these unlucky mummies but-youre
bound to admit there have been some un-
explained fatalities connected with this
case besides-well frankly gentlemen
this bodys less a mummy than a corpse
and ive a terrible aversion to being
around the dead unless theyve been
mummified

  de grandin smiled sarcastically the
old-time fears die hard he assented
nevertheless monsieur we shall respect
your sensibilities you have been most
kind and we would not try your nerves
still further tomorrow if you do not
mind we shall pursue our researches it
may be possible that we shall discover
something hitherto unknown about the
rites and ceremonies of those old ones who
ruled the world when rome had scarce
been thought of

  yes yes af course hodgson
coughed as he edged near the door im
sure i shall be happy to give you a pass to
the museum tomorrow-only-he added
as an afterthought- i must ask that you
refrain from mutilating the body in any
way it belongs to the museum you
know and i simply can not give permis-
sion for an autopsy

  morbleu but you are the shrewd
guesser monsieur de grandin answered
with a laugh i think you must have
read intention in my eyes very well we
consent there shall be no post-mortem
of the body made bon soir monsieur

tm sory doctor de grandin hodg-
a son greeted us the next morning
but im afraid youll not be able to pur-
sue any further investigations with the
mummy - the body i mean - we un-
wrapped last night

  the little frenchman stiffened in both
body and manner you mean that you
have altered your decision monsieur he
asked with cold politeness

  not at all i mean the bodys disinte-
grated with exposure to the air and only
a few wisps of hair the skull and some
unarticulated bones remain while they
werent quite airtight the bandages and
the wax-coated shroud seem to have been
able to keep the flesh intact but exposure
to our damp atmosphere has reduced them
to a heap of bone and dust

  um the frenchman answered
that is unfortunate but not irreparable
i think our chance of finding out the cause
and manner of the poor young ladys death
is not yet gone would you be good
enough to lend us the ornaments some of
the mummy-cloth and several of the
bones monsieur we guarantee their
safe return

  well hodgson hesitated momen-
tarily its not quite regular but if youre

sure you will return them-

  monsieur de grandins voice broke
sharply through the curators apologetic
half-refusal i am jules de grandin i am
not accustomed to having my good faith
assailed no matter the experiment
which i have in mind will not take long
and you are welcome to accompany us
thus you need never have the relics out
of sight at any time will that assure you
of their safe return

  hodgson undid the buttons of his
jacket then did them up again oh
dont think i was doubting your bona
fides he returned but this body cost the
museum a considerable sum and was the

                     w t-
the bleeding mummy



indirect cause of our losing two valuable
members of the staff im personally re-
sponsible for it and-

  no matter de grandin interrupted
if you will come with us i can assure you
that the articles will be within your sight
at all times and you may have them back
again this morning

  accordingly hodgson superintending
fussily we selected the gold and lapis
lazuli diadem the broken humerus one of
the fractured ribs and several lengths of
mummy-cloth which bore the dull-red
blood stains and thrust them into a trav-
eling-bag de grandin paused to call a
number on the phone talked for a mo-
ment in a muted tone then directed me to
an address in scotland road

half an hours drive through the brisk
winter air brought us to a substan-
tial brownstone-fronted residence in the
decaying but still eminently respectable
neighborhood lace curtains hung at the
tall windows of the first floor and the
windows of the basement dining-room
were neatly draped with scrim beside
the carefully polished bell-pull a brass
plate with the legend creighton clair-
voyant was set a neat maid in black
and white uniform responded to de gran-
dins ring and led us to a drawing-room
rather overfurnished with heavy pieces of
the style popular in the middle nineties
mrs creighton will be down immediate-
ly sir shes expecting you she told him
as she left the room

  my experience with those who claim
ability to look beyond the veil was lim-
ited but i had always imagined that they
set their stages more effectively than this
the carpet patterned vith impossible
roses large as cabbages the heavy and not
especially comfortable golden oak chairs
upholstered in green plush the stereotyped
oil paintings of the grand canal of capri
w t -

by moonlight and vesuvius in action
were pragmatic as a plate of prunes and
might have been duplicated item by item
in the parlor of half a hundred non-
fashionable but respectable boarding-
houses even the faint aroma of cooking
food which wafted up to us from the
downstairs kitchen had a reassuring and
worldly tang which seemed entirely out
of harmony with the ghostly calling of our
hostess

   madame creighton fitted her surround-
ings perfectly she was short stout and
matronly and her high-necked white
linen blouse and plain blue skirts were far
more typical of the busy middle-class
housewife than of the self-admitted me-
dium her eyes brown and bright shone
pleasantly behind the lenses of neat rim-
less spectacles her hair already shot with
gray was drawn tightly back from her
forehead and twisted in a commonplace
knot above her occiput even her hands
were plump short-fingered slightly work-
worn and wholly commonplace no-
where was there any indication of the
psychic in her dress face form or
manner

  you brought the things she asked
de grandin when introductions were com-
pleted

  nodding he placed the relics on the
oaken table beside which she was seated

these were discovered- he began

but she raised her hand in warning

   please dont tell me anything about
them she requested id rather my
controls did all that for one never can
be sure how much information secured
while one is conscious may be carried over
into the subconscious while the trance is
on you know

   opening a drawer in the table she took
out a hinged double slate and a box of
thin white chalk

  will you hold this doctor trow-


weird tales

bridge she asked handing me the slate
take it in both hands please and hold
it in your lap please dont move it or at-
tempt to speak to me until i tell you

  awkwardly i took the blank-faced slate
and balanced it on my knees while mrs
creighton drew a small crystal ball from
a little green-felt bag placed it on the
table between the broken arm-bone and
the fractured rib then with a snap of the
switch set an electric light in a goose-
neck fixture standing on the table aglow
the luminance from the glowing bulb
shone directly on the crystal sphere caus-
ing it to glow as though with inward fire

  for a little time-two minutes per-
haps-she gazed intently at the glass ball
then her eyes closed and her head rest-
ing easily against the crocheted doily on
the back of her rocking-chair moved a
little sidewise as her neck muscles relaxed
for a moment she rested thus her regular
breathing only slightly audible

  suddenly astonishingly i heard a
movement of the chalk between the slates
i had not moved or tilted them there
was no chance the little pencil could have
rolled yet unquestionably the thing was
moving now i distinctly felt it as it
traveled slowly back and forth across the
tightly folded leaves of the slate grad-
ually increasing its speed till it seemed
like a panic-stricken prisoned thing rush-
ing wildly round its dungeon in search of
escape

  i had a momentary wild unreasoning
desire to fling that haunted slate away
from me and rush out of that stuffy room
but pride held me in my chair pride made
me grip those slates as a drowning man
might grip a rope pride kept my gaze
resolutely on mrs creighton and off of
the uncanny thing which balanced on my
knees

  i could hear de grandin breathing
quickly hear hodgson moving restlessly

in his chair clearing his throat and i
knew this without looking buttoning
and unbuttoning his coat

  mrs creightons sleep became trou-
bled her head rolled slowly fretfully
from side to side and her breathing be-
came stertorous once or twice she gave
vent to a feeble moan finally the groan-
ing choking cry of a sleeper in a night-
mare her smooth plump hands clenched
nervously and doubled into fists her arms
and legs twitched tremblingly at length
she straightened stiffly in her chair rigid
as though shocked by a galvanic battery
and from her parted lips there came a
muffled strangling cry of horror little
flecks of foam formed at the corners of
her mouth she arched her body upward
then sank bade with a low despairing
whimper and her firm chin sagged down
toward her breast-i knew the symptoms
no medical practitioner can fail to recog-
nize those signs

  madame de grandin cried rising
from his chair and rushing to her side
you are unwell-you suffer

  she struggled to a sitting posture her
brown eyes bulging as though a savage
hand were on her throat her face con-
torted with some dreadful fear for a
moment she sat thus then with a shake
of her head she straightened smoothed
her hair and asked matter-of-factly
did i say anything

  no madame you said nothing artic-
ulate but you seemed in pain so i awak-
ened you

  oh thats too bad she answered
with a smile they tell me i often act
that way when in a trance but i never
remember anything when i wake up and
i never seem any the worse because of
anything i dream while im unconscious
if you had only waited we might have had
a message on the slate

  we have i interrupted i heard
the bleeding mummy



the pencil writing like mad and nearly
threw the thing away

  oh im so glad responded mrs
creighton bring it over and well see
what it says

the slate was covered with fine writ-
ing the minute characters distinct as
script etched on a copper plate running
from margin to margin spaces between
the lines so narrow as to be hardly recog-
nizable

  for a moment we studied the callig-
raphy in puzzled silence then

  nmort de ma vie we have triumphed
over death and time my friends de
grandin cried excitedly attendez sfi
vous pleut opening the slates before
him like a book he read

  revered and awful judges of the
world ye awful ones who sit upon the
parapets of hell i answer guilty to the
charge ye bring against me aye atoua
who now stands on the brink of deathless
death whose body waits the crushing
stones of doom whose spirit robbed for
ever of the hope of fleshly tegument must
wander in amenti till the end of time has
come confesses that the fault was hers
and hers alone

  behold me awesome judges of the
living and the dead am i not a woman
and a woman shaped for love are not
my members beautiful to see my lips like
apricots and pomegranates my eyes like
milk and beryl my breasts like ivory set
with coral yea mighty ones i am a
woman and a woman formed for joy

  was it my fault or my volition that i
was pledged to serve the great all-
mother isis or ever i had left the shelter
of my mothers flesh did i abjure the
blissful agony of love and seek a life of
sterile chastity or was the promise spoken
for me by anothers lips

  i gave all that a woman has to give

and gave it freely knowing that the pains
of death and after death the torment of
the gods awaited me nor do i deem the
price too great to pay

  ye frown ye shake your dreadful
heads upon which rest the crowns of
amun and of kneph of seb and tem of
suti and osiris mighty self ye say that
i speak sacrilege then hear me yet
awhile she who stands in chains before
ye shorn of reverence as a priestess of
great mother isis shorn of all honor as a
woman tells ye these things tg your teeth
knowing that ye can not do her greater
hurt than that she stands already judged to
undergo your reign and that of those
ye serve draws near its end a little while
ye yet may strut and preen yourselves and
mouth the judgments of your gods but
in the days that wait your very names shall
be forgot save vhen some stranger delves
into your tombs and drags your violated
bodies forth for men to make a show of
aye and the very gods ye serve shall be
forgotten - they shall sink so low that
none shall call their names not even as a
curse and in their ruined temples none
shall do them reverence and no living
tiling be found save only the white-bel-
lied lizard and the fearful jackal

  and who shall do this thing an off-
spring of the hebrews yea from the
people ye despise a child shall spring and
great shall be his glory he shall put
down your gods beneath his feet and
spoil them of all glory and respect they
shall become but shaclow-gods of a for-
gotten past

  my name yeve stricken from the roll
of priestesses no writing shall be graven
on my tomb and i shall be forgotten for
all time by gods and men so reads your
judgment i give ye then the lie upon
a day far in the future strange men from
a land across the sea shall open wide my
tomb and take my body from it nor shall


weird tales

my flesh taste of corruption until those
strangers look upon my face and see my
broken bones and seeing wonder how i
died and i shall tell them yea by
osiris self i swear that though i have
been dead for centuries i shall relate the
manner of my judgment and my death
and they shall know my name and weep
for me and on your heads they shall heap
curses for this thing ye do to me

  pile now your stones of doom upon
my breast break my bones and still the
fevered beating of my heart i go to
death but not from out the memory of
men as ye shall go i have spoken

  below the writing was a little scrawl
of drawing as crudely executed as a
childs rough chalk-sketch on a wall yet
as we looked at it we seemed to see the
outline of a woman held upon the ground
by kneeling slaves while a man above her
poised a heavy rock to crush her exposed
breast and another stood in readiness to
aid the executioner

  cordieu de grandin exclaimed as
we gazed upon the drawing i shall say
she told the truth my friends she was
a priestess of the goddess isis and as such
was sworn to lifelong chastity with awful
death by torture as the penalty for viola-
tion of her vow undoubtlessly she loved
not wisely but too well as women have
been wont to love since time began and
upon discovery she was sentenced to the
death decreed for those who did forget
their obligations to the goddess her
chest was broken in with stones and with-

out benefit of mummification her muti-
lated body was put in a casket void of any
writing which might give a clue to her
identity without a single invocation to
the gods who held the fate of her poor
spirit in their hands they buried her but
did she triumph who says otherwise
we know her name atoua we know the
reason and the manner of her death but
those old priests who judged her and de-
creed her doom-who knows their names
yes parbleu who knows or cares a single
solitary damn where their vile mummies
lie they are assuredly gone into obliv-
ion while she-tiens at least she is a per-
sonality to us and we are very much
alive

  excuse me gentlemen if youre quite
finished with these relics ill take them
now professor hodgson interrupted
this little seance has been interesting
but you must admit nothing sufficiently
authentic to be incorporated in our ar-
chives has been developed here i fear
we shall have to label these bones and or-
naments as belonging to an unidentified
body found by doctor larson at naga-
ed-der now if you dont mind i shall

  get anywhere you wish monsieur
and get there quickly de grandin broke
in furiously you have presided over
relics of the dead so long your brain is
clogged with mummy-dust as for your
heart-mort dun rat mort i do not think
you have one

  as for me he added with a sudden
smile i return at once to doctor trow-
bridges this poor young ladys tragic
fate affects me deeply and unless some
urgent business interferes i plan to drown
my sorrow-morbleu i shall do more
within the hour i shall be most happily
intoxicated

weird tales

plotter and garfield draughon his
helper and co-conspirator will die under
the flame in the public square of colony
 tomorrow morning at nine oclock be
present and see the traitors die

  ironic invitation of course id be
there - as one of the principal actors
all over the world the news was being
spread by the mechanical voices from the
public information bureau in the council
building and in our home colony 
there would be white faces whispers and
not a few tears already i could see the
platform raised above the heads of the
milling throng could see the black metal
of the flame-projector above its thin-
slitted fan-shaped muzzle suspended be-
tween the slim metal columns with black
george the executioner standing by his
finger on the trigger mechanism a malev-
olent grin on his evil countenance i
shivered involuntarily

  woodruff and i were to go the same
route taken by the leaders of the unsuc-
cessful revolt in colony  a few months
ago together we had watched black
george touch that deadly lever a score
of times and with each pressure a sheet
of electronic flame had sheared a head
from its supporting neck more cleanly
than ever did the guillotine of three cen-
turies before horror-filled but with
hate for our oppressors more deeply in-
grained than ever we had gone back to
our quiet work of organization this
next attempt must not fail the progress
of the world itself depended upon its
success

  but it had failed nipped in the bud so
to speak by a cursed traitor in our own
ranks tomorrow woodruff and i would
die and organized crime would leer
mockingly at the puny effort to dethrone
it

  i shuddered no man can face such a
death without a qualm but i could have

climbed the metal steps to the execution
platform with a fortitude bom of pleas-
ure could i have held the treacherous neck
of dured akridge on a line with my own

  the pale thin face of the rotten-souled
traitor flitted before my mind madden-
ingly out of reach of my avenging fingers
because of him the only man on earth
able to lead the despairing colonies out
of their virtual enslavement would die on
the scaffold in the morning with me
powerless to do aught but pace the smooth
floor of my cell like a trapped animal i
stared at the smooth green glass about me
that held its prisoners more jealously than
did the stpne and steel of the old peniten-
tiaries floor walls ceiling of opaque
glass the monotony broken only by the
ventilator grating in an upper corner and
the metallic mouth of the loud-speaker in
the opposite angle only faint parallel
lines marked the position of the door op-
erated only from the wardens office

  no use to fume i dropped hopelessly
on the inflated mattress never had there
been an escape from the great glass pris-
on and never would there be one without
outside connivance thanks to the devilish
ingenuity of that cursed de berrie the
renegade scientist who had given his bril-
liant genius to organized crime back in
 after the collapse of the peoples
moral fiber and the only man feared
by the international council was safely
sealed in the next cell to mine

  garfield draughon report to war-
dens office

  the order came metallically through the
speaker from the prison tube the door
panel slid noiselessly down into the wall
on its groove-and-flange joints i passed
through into the glass corridor

the corridor a tier of cells on either
side narrowed as it approached the
office its other terminal stopping at the
rear of the semicircular building nine i
spawn of the shadows



other corridors like the spokes in an old-
fashioned wheel had their only outlet in
the office where the warden on duty sat
before a bank of controls and attended
single-handed to the whole institution

  the office panel slid down i entered
the circular room and stopped stiffening
the warden was calvin muir the ren-
egade de berries right-hand man he
sat behind a horseshoe desk a flame-pistol
convenient to his hand and eyed me spec-
ulatively then he glanced at the clock
glowing in the glass wall and sprang to
his feet

   im to bring you to the council build-
ing at once he said crisply walk
ahead of me and at the first quick motion
youll lose an arm or a leg march

  he pressed a button and the big exit
panel slid down i went gingerly down
the broad steps and into the twilight of
the courtyard

  straight ahead to the tube line he
directed and i obeyed my hands at my
side there was no enclosing wall the
streets about the prison were empty be-
ing reserved for officials only but i knew
that at the first suspicious move i would
be crippled before i had fairly started
later maybe my heart leaped

  we dipped in under the public tube
line and emerged beside the official
groove the prison rocket tube rested in
the shining metal groove and muir or-
dered me inside he entered behind me
motioned me forward and took the con-
trols in the rear with a jerk we shot
forward

  the sudden turn of events had sent a
foolish hope swirling in my head had
the council relented or unearthed
evidence in our favor reason scorned
the thought the council never relented
its decree was as final as death itself and
there was no evidence to discover that was
not incriminating the traitor akridge

had done his dirty work only too well
no there was something else in the wind
which i would learn in due time but it
would be wise to steel myself against any
hope of mercy

   the expansion brakes brought us to a
halt before the private gateway to the
council building- a massive pile of con-
crete glass and steel muir motioning
me out followed at my heels and directed
me through a maze of corridors into a
pneumatic shuttle which took us swiftly
a quarter-mile above the ground floor and
deposited us in a circular room in the
tower to the left a door swung open
and we marched into a richly furnished
room not i observed the room in which
i had been sentenced

   in a chair almost swallowing him sat a
small plump man whom i instantly rec-
ognized as joroon de berrie the coun-
cils sub-chief and advisor small point-
ed mustaches protruded needle-like from
his upper lip and his black eyes were so
intensely piercing they seemed to emit
beams of deadly power muir snapped to
attention but i stood stolidly before this
hated co-ruler of the earth

  he eyed me with hypnotic intensity
suddenly he sprang to his feet

  be seated he commanded waving
me to a chair then he planted himself
before me his short legs spread wide his
eyes streaming force

  tomorrow morning you die he
barked do you wish to live

   who doesnt i countered

   the decree of the council is absolute
-as a rule he stated harshly but i
de berrie control the council if i say
the word you live understand

   i nodded this preliminary was lead-
ing to something and i must be on my
guard what did he want information

   i can give you life position wealth
he ticked them off on his thick fingers


weird tales

lancing me with his fiery eyes or i
can give you the flame there is a price
of course the life of a rebel means not
that much to me he snapped a finger
contemptuously

  i shrugged you seem to know me
better than i know myself i have no
money-the tax assessments keep me
stripped and i continued hotly if
that traitor akridge left anything about
the uprising untold it will stay that way
for ever as far as im concerned

  de berrie shook his head impatiently
the rebellion is out-like that i
wish to hear no more of it but in men-
tioning your poverty you touched the
thing i have in mind how does colony
 pay its tax of a quarter-million semi-
annually

  i drew a quick breath so that was it
woodruff had foreseen the contingency
months ago

  ever since organized crime overthrew
world governments draughon because of
foolish sentimentalism on the part of
society and the gradual breakdown of the
public moral fiber they have been jealous
and fearful of the remnants of the old so-
called aristocracy hence their segrega-
tion into colonies and as society used
to try to tax the vice districts out of ex-
istence so is organized crime attempting
to discourage those who scorn their dis-
torted views sooner or later they will
wonder where colony  gets its quarter-
million half-payment from two thousand
people de berries only god is gold
pray the time does not come until we are
ready to act

  the time had come and we were not
ready

   de berrie stamped his foot on the thick
rug

  answer he rasped and dont lie
i know much

  he knew all that akridge knew of

course but how much had the traitor
found out i answered evasively

  woodruff has paid the last two years
taxes from his personal resources and
when you kill him that much of your in-
come is stopped

  what resources quick as a phys-
icist the sneer was pointed

  certainly not the international
council confiscated his profitable discov-
eries yoti yourself stole his universal
mechanical voice

   it was a foolish thrust a flame-pistol
leaped into his hand and he took delib-
erate aim at my right arm

   answer direct he shouted or youll
go under the flame a cripple

  i was mad had there been the slight-
est chance of killing him i would have
sprung for his throat but there wasnt
not with the two of them armed and alert
suddenly it dawned on me-the reason
for my summons unwittingly akridge
had done me a favor

  the gold comes from a deposit we dis-
covered on the moon two years ago my
heart thumped as i watched for the effect
of this statement but my hunch was
right de berrie pocketed his weapon
and smiled with satisfaction

  good you are speaking truth de
berrie will not forget and the ship in
which you make these trips to the moon
eh you will pilot it in return for your
life

  and that of professor woodruff

  but de berrie shook his head emphat-
ically what you ask is impossible not
even de berrie could save the instigator
of the rebellion nor would he you
are of no consequence woodruff yes
besides it would take me no great time to
operate this ship myself no de berrie
is not a fool he is a scientist the great-
est
spawn of the shadows



i saw the force of his reasoning exper-
imentation would teach him the con-
trol of the w-r without my help and i
was necessary to him only because i prom-
ised quick gratification of his greed for
the yellow metal of course he must
have the ship first but the fact that ak-
ridge knew of it at all indicated that he
might have a hazy idea of its hiding-
place jealously though we had guarded
the secret

  but i risked one more delay

  what guarantee have i that you will
stick to your bargain after i have done my
part

  guarantee he shrieked in a passion
of impatience you have my word-the
word of de berrie-

  which is not worth a copper i in-
terrupted

  he turned on me in a fury and for a
moment i thought i had gone too far for
his flame-pistol leaped into my face and
his finger trembled on the trigger

  you may never find the ship i re-
minded him

  he knew it he dropped the pistol to
his pocket and his piercing eyes flashed
with baffled rage suddenly he reached
into an inner pocket and drew forth a
small emblem fan-shaped of blood-red
gold-the sign of the flame a talisman
possessed only by favorites and agents of
the council and as potent as a modern
aladdins lamp he thrust it at me with
a cunning leer

  here-you do not trust de berrie but
he gives you proof of his sincerity with
this talisman you could free even your
friend woodruff no to say nothing of
having power wealth-

  his words trailed off into a shout of
laughter in his colossal conceit and se-
curity he was baiting me-offering me the
one chance in a million---

  and warning me what to expect

the trip through the stratosphere in
de berries private ship from the
council building stage in washington to
the virginia mountains where colony 
was isolated from the teeming life of the
coast took but a few minutes in the
cabin with us his shifty eyes refusing to
meet mine was the arch-traitor dured
akridge brought along no doubt to
check up on me muir also accompanied
us ordering a relief to take his place in
the prison for the night

   with the aid of its floodlight the plane
settled lightly in an open space outside the
colony boundary under the hawk-like
eyes of muir and de berrie i crawled out
of the ship and looked longingly toward
the little city where we had planned and
wrought so hard - and so fruitlessly
little had i dreamed then that i would
soon be leading the enemy to the unmask-
ing of our most precious secret - the
space-ship which was to play such a prom-
inent part in our dreams of freedom

  i led the party to the sheer face of a
cliff overhung by the wooded brow of a
mountain de berrie held a light-tube
while i located the control switch in its
hidden crevice and the great rock-veneered
door slid back in its groove a second
switch inside the door illuminated the in-
terior of the huge cavern part natural
part excavated by faithful hands-the
hangar for the w-r and professor wood-
ruffs secret laboratory

  de berrie drew a quick breath of in-
terest at sight of the apparatus so pains-
takingly collected but he tore himself
away from the more familiar appliances
and gave his attention to the gleaming
metallic hull of the space-ship this i
knew was of especial interest to him ow-
ing to the fact that one of his own inven-
tion had crashed back to earth with disas-
trous results only a year before when its
rocket motive power had failed only a
 

weird tales

hundred miles or so up woodruff had
used beam propulsion developed from his
experiments with cosmic rays

  i entered the open airlock followed
closely by muir with his ever ready pis-
tol de berrie came last then i closed
the outer door automatically opening the
inner panel which gave access to the com-
fortable cabin de berrie motioned me
to the controls taking a seat beside me
his intention was to occupy my seat on
the return trip i reflected grimly i
opened the bakelite power dial pulled
down the starting-lever which simultane-
ously released the electro-magnetic grav-
ity-repulsion rays and we floated silently
out of the cavern and into the night

  up up we soared until i saw in the
moonlight on the vision mirror the gray
line of the atlantic ocean up until the
altimeter needle in the pressure gage
showed that we were nearly out of the
atmosphere then i poised the ship
while i adjusted the spectroscope-selector
to the moons spectrum the bow tilted
gently and swung about i turned the
power dial until the speed indicator hov-
ered at a point a fiftieth the speed of light
de berrie scientist that he was asked but
few questions then he applied himself
to the radio vision mirror on the instru-
ment board

  the mirror filled swiftly with moon
surface mountains and craters even the
larger rock masses began to show in de-
tail i cut off the propulsion beams and
reversed the electro-magnetic field of the
gravity motors we were in effect hur-
tling forward with the brakes set i stud-
ied the mirror intently nursing the ship
toward the sharp spire of a mountain
which i had named mount woodruff in
honor of the professor at sight of the
landmark a vague plan began to form in
my mind and i acted on the hunch by
guiding the craft to a stopping-place some

distance beyond our usual landing-point
we settled on the moon with a slight
jar i turned to de berrie

  this peak mount woodruff is our
stopping-point but the professor has
always been the pilot and i can not tell
for certain whether we stopped on the
right side of it until we get out

  de berrie accepted the explanation in
excellent good humor

  de berrie is always reasonable he
said graciously besides you have all to
gain by playing fair eh you think de
berrie would leave you on the dead planet
to perish but no draughon could not
foment rebellion but woodruff ah he
is the man whom the council fears with
him at large-but he is safe in the great
glass house

  he laughed i gritted my teeth help-
lessly and began laying out the space-
suits and pointed out the radio equipment
for use on the airless planet but i made
no mention of the little dial on each suit
whose magnetic needle always pointed
toward the w-r my plan was growing
steadily one at a time we emerged from
the air-lock into the blinding glare of the
unrefracted sunlight

i looked anxiously about me for a fa-
miliar landmark and breathed easier
so far so good to my left and above me
loomed the naked craggy eminence of the
professors peak easily recognizable by
the deep fissure which split its sheer east-
ern face as though it had been cloven
with a knife the treasure deposit i now
knew lay about a mile around the base of
the mountain to the right and to reach
it we would have to pass before the mouth
of the great fissure and through the shad-
ow cone of the ancient volcano a shadow
as black as a cauldron of pitch

  de berries voice sounded loudly in
my helmet
spawn of the shadows



  do you know your position remem-
ber no trickery

  i should have landed more to the
right i told him apologetically the
deposit lies some distance ahead shall
we go on

  i hoped desperately that my voice gave
him no inkling of how much depended
on his decision despite his reassuring
words i had not missed the significant
look and gesture he had given muir as
we left the council building my useful-
ness would be over when i showed them
the gold and if he chose to cover the gap
id purposely made in the w-r i was

lost but if we walked--

  he look one step and the unfamiliar
buoyancy of his body due to the lessened
gravitation decided the issue he mo-
tioned me in front

  i smiled grimly as we struck out with
easy strides across the sere parched face
of the dead planet little good muirs
ever-present pistol would do him if my
scheme carried de berries conceit and
his greed for gold and power would
wither swiftly in the vast silence of the
lifeless desert and akridge his yel-
low soul would perish miserably from very
cowardice when he realized his plight

  but the plan i had formed was desper-
ate almost suicidal yet it offered a re-
mote chance of escape while if i once
reached the little crater with its wealth of
raw gold my doom was certain and with
it woodruffs and with woodruffs
chaos for the helpless colonies i picked
the way through the motionless dust
formed by the terrific extremes of tem-
perature past scattered sharp-edged
boulders almost to the edge of the shad-
ow cone itself when de berries exclama-
tion checked me

  god what shadows no air no dif-
fusion of the light rays not like earth
-eh-with its atmospheric motes that

reflect the beam and make the shadows
less frightening we skirt this inky
wall draughon i have no desire to step
blindly into an abyss like the crevasse
there

  he pointed to a split in the parched
crust of the dead satellite a crack several
feet wide its bottom lost in unfathom-
able darkness we could see its irregular
line extending on ahead of us to the right
beginning in the curving rim of a crater
towering hundreds of feet high while the
near end lost itself somewhere in the shad-
ow cone of the peak which jutted across
the path i had taken

  checkmate in my eagerness to put my
scheme into effect i had plunged ahead
without thinking de berrie was no sim-
pleton to walk blindly into a trap i
veered away from the black veil dodging
the scattered fragments of stone blown
out of the great crater ages ago skirting
the base of a precipitous jagged mass of
rock of a crystalline quartz which reflect-
ed the sun rays in a blinding dazzle
above the sun was poised like a great
yellow fireball against a curtain of black
velvet and my eyes rested a moment
longingly on the huge beautiful crescent
that was earth

  marching with great effortless strides
that covercd the flinty ground astonishing-
ly fast we came to the fissure which was
at least fifteen feet wide i leaped it
easily as did muir and de berrie ak-
ridge held back coward-like but made
the ridiculously easy spring at de berries
impatient command i was relieved for
i wanted the traitor with us not skulking
about the flyer

beyond the crevasse fate gave me the
the break i was hoping for a steep
sheer crater rim jutted into our line of
march forcing us to make a long detour
or walk within a few feet of the shadow
line i chose the latter way momentarily


weird tales

expecting de berrie to halt me but he
seemed oblivious to the move and i quiet-
ly loosened the light-tube in its leather
socket at my waist

  briefly my plan was to dart into the
protection of the impenetrable shadow
and make a break back for the w-r
earth strength plus moon gravity would
give me speed and the surprize would
give the necessary seconds for a safe start
with my light-tube i should be able to
avoid a plunge into a crevasse and their
flame-pistols would be useless with no
visible target the dangerous part of the
scheme was the first few moments of
flight which i must make blind for the
light-tube would give me away to my pur-
suers and i must risk plunging into one of
the innumerable cracks which split the
planets crust at frequent intervals after
the first hundred yards i would be safe
for i doubted the tubes ability to show
light even that far in the almost palpable
blackness

  but the chance had to be taken it at
least offered a sporting risk and death
was death whatever the form we ap-
proached the point my muscles tensed
and i whirled and sprang into the envel-
oping shadow

  the transition was as abrupt and start-
ling as a plunge into a pool of ink in-
stantly i lost all sense of direction my
helmet roared with a shout of surprize
from de berrie and muir i leaped
ahead blindly and popped into the glar-
ing light in front of dured akridge par-
alyzed in his tracks his face white behind
his helmet for an instant i was tempted
to make a dash through the sunlight but
a flashing thought showed the hazard of
discovery and the menace of the pistols
so i sprang back into the blackness

  a sudden scream of fear shrilling in my
helmet halted me not a moment too soon
else i had rammed full into de berrie a

light-tube flashed its sudden luminance
not ten feet away and a horrible sight
etched itself into my brain

  muir was struggling in the grip of a
nightmarish monster that could well have
come from the slime-pits of hell full in
the light cone from the tube held by the
astounded de berrie muir battled with
his attacker his throaty gasps sounded
clearly over the radio of normal size
was muir but the creature topped him by
a head its form was that of man but
its body was covered like a fishs with
overlapping green scales and the fingers
inexorably gripping muirs body ended
in short stubby claws that could have tom
the hapless man to shreds except for the
protecting metallic suit the monsters
head was rounded scaled and seemed
neckless and the eye-sockets were hollow
pits as the light had flashed on them i
somehow gained the impression that the
thing was horned but a clearer view
showed no indication of it

  a bubbling scream of horror died on
muirs lips as he was jerked into the
blackness de berries shout shrilled up
into a shriek of dismay the light cone
wavered was abruptly extinguished a
hollow moan echoed in my helmet

  de berrie too was gone

  consternation seized me i fled wildly
in the direction i thought lay the sunlight
i had just left frantic to escape the un-
known terrors lurking in a shadow sud-
denly become more menacing than any
peril i had ever faced the thought that
my enemies had been wiped from my
path was smothered in fear of the mon-
sters that laired in the shadows cast by the
frowning crags of the dead planet

 panic seized me a dozen great leaps
found me still in the shadow i was run-
ning in a circle hopelessly lost the di-
rection dial on my suit i reached for the
light-tube just as powerful holds clamped
spawn of the shadows



about my waist and flung me heavily to
the iron-hard ground the shock knocked
me unconscious

ifelt myself being dragged roughly
along over a fairly smooth surface like
rock a voice was dinning into my ears

  muir draughon akridge are you
dead eh answer me

   it was de berrie and close to judge by
the volume of sound i answered it
was comforting to know that i was not
alone with the horror even if de berrie
was an enemy

  we are in a corridor of stone came
the voice and the brute who has you is
treading on my heels if you are able we
will stop and fight no speak quickly
it seemed futile but desperation will
force a man to many foolish things i
flung myself to my feet wrenching loose
from the clawed fingers

  now i screamed and grappled with
the subman with the fury of despair

   instantly there was silent turmoil in the
narrow gallery

  with every ounce of a strength six
times greater than normal i slugged at the
scaly body of the nightmarish brute that
grappled me and felt my fist protected
by the metallic gloves grow numb with
the impact it was like striking the hide
of a crocodile the brute ignored the
blow and sought to envelop my body in
its scaly iron-strong arms i knew though
i could neither see nor hear that its claws
were seeking a vulnerable spot in my suit
de berries laboring gasps mingled with
my own sounded loud in my ears swift-
ly i searched for what passed for the crea-
tures face if i could dig my mailed fin-
gers into those deep eye-sockets but my
groping hand clutched instead a rubbery
protuberance extending from the fore-
head i gripped the yielding projection
tightly in an effort to twist it from the
skull but the advantage was short-

lived the monster flung me to the rock
floor of the gallery with a force that shook
my bones and threatened the thick glass
of my helmet face immediately it
dropped on my body and i lost hope one
smash on the helmet with that homy
hand would be the finish but the end
was not yet

  without warning the dense blackness
melted swiftly before a soft flaming glow
that seemed to come from the wall behind
the moon-thing-a wall which the red-
dish light showed to be cracked and fis-
sured like the surface of the tortured
planet instantly i saw the creature draw
away from me saw him hideously out-
lined for a moment against the lambent
glow like a devil from hell then he van-
ished into the gloom of the corridor

  i struggled erect and stumbled over
de berrie he groaned and muttered
clutching me for support as he got pain-
fully to his feet

  god he said hoarsely what was
it draughon-beast reptile or devil

  i shook my head forgetting that he
couldnt see the gesture the mysterious
red glow waned brightened then died
out we stood free in the stygian black-
ness

  i dont know but it handled me like a
baby but that strange red light seemed
to scare the thing away what was it
another devil eh but it rescued us
more spawn of these accursed shadows
but we are in its debt no

  happily we were in ignorance of the
ghastly payment yet to be made for that
timely deliverance i thought only of the
blessed sunlight somewhere outside thisl
devilish gallery of gloom

  which way leads out i lost all sensti 
of direction

  you strike the nub of the situation
draughon i myself was whirled about
so madly in the embrace of that fiend that x


weird tales

i have no notion of how to proceed shall
we tty this way it is as good as any no

  it was in single file we started down
the narrow corridor each thankful for
the others presence a tacit truce for the
time being binding us together against the
common cause of deadly peril

  de berrie was talkative

  we can talk with safety eh
draughon the mightiest crash could
make no noise on this accursed planet
poor muir he was a good lieutenant
it is your fault draughon for leaping
into that hellish shadow but we will
forget that until we see eh

  i ignored the implied threat

  poor draughon the cheerful rascal
chuckled he thought to escape and use
the little emblem to free his compatriot
no the discovery of professor wood-
ruff kept so secret which would reduce
the council to terms and liberate the col-
onies from their oppression will be lost
under the flame in the morning despite
draughons so heroic effort alas he
chuckled again we shall not escape i
feel it

  i started at his knowledge of our plans
gad how much had akridge learned
all evidently however the cause was
lost anyway as de berrie so cheerfully
admitted escape was very remote wood-
ruff himself the very key to the colonies
plans was in no more dangerous straits
than ourselves we were somewhere in
the bowels of a mountain that reared its
forbidding crags above the arid desolate
face of a long-dead world surrounded
probably by weird unknown and unfa-
miliar enemies against whom we had no
means of defense except our empty hands
which had so far seemed wofully inade-
quate de berrie had lost his weapon
his light-tube and mine had fallen some-
where in that awful shadow at any mo-
ment we might drop soundlessly into

some bottomless fissure yawning unseen
across our path or we might plunge
full tilt into some horrible denizen of this
eldritch cavern spawn of the shadows
de berrie had aptly named them

we marched stolidly on silent now
shunted this way and that by the
twisting walls of the corridor presently
we rounded a sharp turn and de berrie
halted so abruptly that i bumped into
him

  ahead of us draughon look have
my eyes gone mad in this tomb-like shaft
or is this hellish darkness thinning

  my eyes caught the difference as he
spoke it was not actual light but rather
a dilution of the darkness as milk may
lighten the shade of ink encouraged we
hurried on the luminance became more
pronounced like moonlight on earth dif-
fused by fog

  de berrie stopped short with an excla-
mation of dismay

  the pit the pit of hell itself we
have blundered into a nest of the accursed
devils

  i pressed close and looked over de
berries shoulder

  before us opened a vast subterranean
chamber roughly round whose sloping
jagged walls and domed roof emitted a
ghostly bluish radiance that fairly illumi-
nated the interior and the weird activity
going on in the center of the chamber

  a horde of the submen were grouped
in a semicircle about a bare place in the
middle of which was a smooth flat stone
like an altar on this pedestal stood one
of the creatures gesticulating with his tal-
oned hands much like a political speaker
on earth i stared at him in horrified fas-
cination

  the detailed view was even more repul-
sive than the hasty glance i had got dur-
ing muirs fight with one of the brutes
especially the face evolution perhaps
spawn of the shadows



had done away with ears and nostrils
whether vestigial gill-slits were left i
could not see at that distance but a small
mouth was evidenced by a thin line of
lips but the eyes my first impression
of horns was now confirmed only the pro-
tuberances were tipped with bulging
orbs-eyes that were telescoped at will
according to the amount of light avail-
able it was an eye then that i had
wrenched in the corridor incurring swift
reprisal

  and the extended orbs of the creature
on the altar were emitting intermittent
flashes of reddish light so regularly
spaced and definite in briefness or dura-
tion they could mean only one thing-
speech the only communication possible
in a soundless world

  a priest de berrie whispered excit-
edly he is harranguing his audience
exhorting them that group behind the
altar eh and that blurred bundle on
the ground it looks-it is it is muir
they have brought him here to the coun-
cil chamber

   de berries voice had risen to a shriek
startling me despite the knowledge that
the submen could not hear but the
words did carry for a voice weak but
plainly audible over the radio sounded in
my ears muirs

  have they got the rest of you what
are they de berrie brutes or humans
de berrie explained how we came to
the cavern and asked a few questions

  no they didnt hurt me-the space-
suit was protection but i think theyre
saving me for a sacrifice i judge the
brute on the altar to be a priest they
seem to take orders from him have you
any weapons

  no my pistol was lost in the strug-
gle and you eh

  nothing and the devils are strong
it was that damned draughon that led

us into the trap im gone de berrie
but by god i want you to make drau-
ghon pay for his treachery

  this was a complication i hadnt fore-
seen i looked at de berrie and saw him
regarding me speculatively through the
glass of his helmet then he turned
away but the glance put me on my guard
the truce was off muirs passionate
words had fired anew the old hate which
our mutual danger had for the moment
side-tracked nor was i bothered by
muirs charge of treachery for i had
only anticipated their own treachery

  fresh activity in the chamber switched
our minds to other channels at a mo-
tion from the priest one of the creatures
began climbing a rude ledge which spi-
raled the walls at a steep pitch until it
reached the center of the dome using his
taloned fingers and toes to good advan-
tage i back-trailed the ledge and dis-
covered that it circled down the wall to
the corridor beside us where it terminated
a few feet from the floor a number of
faintly luminous objects of the size and
shape of a coconut caught my eye a
line of them extended along the ledge
against the wall as far as i could see
touching one i found it warm and slight-
ly yielding like rubber

  de berrie observing picked one up
and examined it with the curiosity of a
scientist i heard him mutter

   phosphorescent eh like the walls it
could be-ah it is undoubtedly an egg
the brutes are oviparous and the cavern
is a huge incubator

  he picked up one of the ovoids and
held it in his hand

the exhorter on the pedestal finished
his discourse a storm of silent ap-
plause swept the horde as they vigorously
raised and lowered their scaly arms in ex-
cited approval the priest turned his
back to them and lifted his arms in an


weird tales

attitude of supplication his head tilted
back his repulsive eyes concentrated on
the dome where the climber sat on the
ledge staring intently downward

  the silent cavern seemed charged with
eery vibrations i was minded to turn
and flee down the corridor while there
was yet time but a terrible fascination
kept me spellbound de berrie was in-
tent on the tableau

  the watcher on the ledge had moved
stood upright his taloned hands moved
swiftly over the wall behind him and
above his head and a thin pencil of light
appeared dropping slowly like a tiny
stream of water poured from a height
the ray descended until it struck full
upon the priest on the altar still in his
posture of supplication rapidly now the
beam swelled until it became a round col-
um of blue radiance streaming down
from the lofty dome and bathing the
priest in a weird cascade of ghostly fog it
streamed over his armored body envel-
oping him like an impalpable dully shim-
mering robe whose train overspread the
stone like a sheet of liquid overflowing
at last into the depths below the cavern
floor apparently through a seam in the
rock supporting the altar it purled and
rippled like a thick sirupy fluid though
in substance it seemed like smoke

  de berrie tremendously excited
clutched my arm

  god he ejaculated is it gas liq-
uid or a radio-active emanation eh if i
but had a flask of it not even in the
laboratory have i de berrie seen such
stuff hist they take muir

  the guards about muir had seized him
dragging him erect

  he resists-he fights de berrie
was nearly frantic they drag him to
the altar-he holds back muir is a
fighter a grand fighter he grapples the
guards curse them their armor is like

that of the crocodile he can not hurt
them it is the end ah

  the guards assisted by some of the
horde picked muir up and bore him to
the altar they halted while the priest
stepped from the stone the phosphor-
escence clinging to his body so that he
glowed incandescently like a fiend step-
ping from the fires of hell

  they throw muir into the emanation
shrieked de berrie a yell from muir
was clipped oddly short as though the
radio had collapsed beneath the ray he
must feel its hellish influence through the
space-suit that yell now he bounds
from the accursed altar and charges his
tormenters hells furies why did i
lose my pistol

   i was keyed up like the excitable scien-
tist but the scene was nearly done muir
struggled gamely but hopelessly de
berrie in his insane eagerness to see it
ali clambered awkwardly upon the ledge
four of the huge brutes picked muir up
and spread-eagled him forcibly upon the
altar for a few seconds that must have
been agonizing for even the giant
strength of the submen was shaken by his
terrific struggles

  then he stilled lay motionless in the
steady flow of the ghastly beam

  he melts-he melts he is dissolv-
ing like metal in the acid god what
power the accursed ray has do you see
draughon do you observe

  i swore silently de berrie was more
interested in the tragedy from a scientific
standpoint than in the horrible death suf-
fered by his lieutenant for muir was
gone dissolved under the awful beam like
a tab of butter for a bit the metal of his
space-suit lingered in a little shapeless
heap then it too disappeared

  calamity exploded before us like a
bomb

   de berrie unable to keep still in some

                     w t-
spawn of the shadows



way knocked one of the rubbery ovoids
off the shelf like an animate telltale it
bounced slightly on the hard floor then
rolled over the smooth sloping surface
straight toward the group about the altar

   the keen eyes of the priest saw it first
consternation held me in a vise while his
hideous eyes swiftly traced the ovoids
back trail and rested full upon us for a
split second then the orbs turned to the
multitude brief flashes sparked a com-
mand and with one accord the mass
rushed toward us

  before my dull wits could function
de berrie flung himself from the shelf
gave me a trip and a push that sent me
sprawling and dashed away i sprang to
my feet full in the path of the onrushing
reptilian horde it was too late to run
i looked desperately about for a rock frag-
ment but the smooth floor was bare of
even the smallest splinter with the in-
stinctive gesture of a dying man i reached
back to the ledge grasped one of the rub-
bery eggs and with a cry of utter futility
hurled it full into the face of the priest
who was leading the rush

   it burst in a phosphorescent mush the
brutes paused milled in confusion and i
fled down the corridor on the wings of
fear

   i tore through the blackness with fran-
tic speed nerves twitched in ghastly ex-
pectation of taloned hands from the dark-
ness clutching my flying body streams
of cold sweat coursed down my back
sweat born of a nightmare of fear a fear
heightened by the knowledge that there
could be no sound of pursuit no warn-
ing of danger-until death struck from
the darkness

   suddenly a shout rang in my ears the
shout of a human being in dire distress a
shout torn from stricken lungs at the on-
slaught of desperate peril i slowed up
rounding a corner and crashed into the
w t-

opposite wall only my extended arm
saving the glass in my helmet from de-
struction the collision saved me from
plunging headlong into the acme of the
horrors produced by this cavern of dread

   de berrie was fast in the clutches of a
gigantic scorpion

the darkness in the corridor glowed
as if heated in a forge the luminance
flowing from the huge bulging eyes of the
insect the scorpions palpi equipped
with two-foot scissor-like claws em-
braced the scientist like a pair of giant
shears the thin metal of his space-suit
was giving visibly under the terrific pres-
sure but despite the peril of a punctured
suit de berrie was making no effort to
dislodge the claws every ounce of power
was concentrated on keeping that deadly
upcurved tail from plunging its great
barb into his body

   my own danger was forgotten in a rush
of horror this then was the thing that
had frightened away the submen with its
sinister glow but the irony of that res-
cue was lost in terrified fascination slow-
ly irresistibly the armored segments of
the great tail lifted the murderous horn in
an arc that would plunge the poisonous
barb into de berries shoulder over the
radio came the short gasps the stertorous
breathing of the man as he strove with
mighty effort to prevent completion of
the fatal arc his hands gripping the tail
with the courage of despair

   i forgot his treachery in tripping me in
the face of the horde of submen forgot
even that he was de berrie hated sub-
chief of die dreaded council and searched
the floor of the corridor for a bit of stone
but the floor was barren of weapons save
for the ovoid which de berrie had taken
from the cavern chamber and dropped
when attacked by the scorpion i seized
it drew back my arm then saw the futil-
ity of interference my arm lowered


weird tales

  higher rose the mighty armored seg-
ments of the tail higher until de berries
pudgy figure was stretched as far as the
palpis claws would permit still the tail
arched as resistlessly as the boom of a der-
rick

  with a sobbing gasp of despair de
berrie let go the pointed barb flashed
dully in the glow of die monsters eyes as
it sped through its arc and sank into the
victims shoulder piercing the space-suit
as if it were soft tin

  de berrie collapsed

  i shook with an ague of horror the
gigantic arachnid withdrew its bloody
barb and turned its glowing eyes on me

  i sprang into the shadow forgetting
the menace behind under the threat of
death ahead but the creature drew back
seemingly satisfied for the time being and
began to back into a crevice dragging the
body of de berrie with it for awhile i
waited the lambent glow dimmed then
disappeared and the shadows blotted out
the scene of the tragedy

  i sprang forward fleeing the place as
though a thousand devils pursued

into the sunshine i raced stumbled and
fell headlong blinded by the glare i
studied the direction dial on the suit and
followed its course until i came to the
edge of the crevasse beyond was the
jagged pile of quartz flaming in the sun
like a beacon of hope a little farther on
the metallic hull of the w-r glinted
warm welcome i crawled through the
air-lock and into the cabin dropping ex-
hausted before the instrument panel

  muir gone de berrie gone ak-
ridge i had not seen him since i had so
foolishly popped back into the shadow
gone too no doubt at any rate i was
free

  the fact stimulated me i threw off
the lethargy which had come over me as
my taut nerves relaxed i got out of the

space-suit swiftly almost stepping on the
weird egg which i had unconsciously
brought to the ship and dropped on the
floor there was much to be done yet
and destiny had intervened in my behalf

  i threw the switch and the generators
purred softly charging the hull plates
with gravity-repelling energy the ship
wavered as weightless as a mote only the
motor-generated gravity field in the floor
insulated from the hull enabled me to sit
upright i tuned in the selectroscope on
earth opened the power dial a few notch-
es and the propulsion beams shot us into
space

  i looked at my watch and was amazed
to find that only a little over three hours
had elapsed since we left earth i felt
in my pocket for the emblem de berrie
had given me out of his confidence that
i would be unable to use it the chance
in a million had hit if the luck just
held until i could get woodruff clear of
the prison it would be the beginning of
the end for the crime organizations that
controlled the world

   but the issue was still in the balance
one slip could bring disaster

   the radio-vision mirror was filled with
the earth brilliant with moon reflection
i shut off the power and reversed the
gravitational field and we slid into the
stratosphere at little more than a thousand
miles an hour through the telesccope i
caught the florida peninsula and swung
the bow about to follow the atlantic
coastline clearly marked by the terrific
beacons

  in a few minutes the detector caught
the high frequency waves from the air-
lane signal tower at washington the
needle swinging to the identification pole
on the illuminated dial i swung inland
and ten minutes later dropped the w-r
in the courtyard of the great prison

  the delicate part of my job was before
spawn of the shadows



me and i knew there were no weapons
in the flyer my success depended en-
tirely on the potency of the little emblem
but when my eye fell on the ovoid on the
floor a thought struck me it had saved
my life once or another one had and it
might come in handy again i stooped
and picked it up slipping it into a handy
pocket

  the thing was hot almost uncomfort-
ably so wondering about it i passed
out of the air-lock and crossed the court-
yard to the prison steps at the speaking-
tube i paused

  open i have a message from de
berrie

  the great portal slid down and i
walked into the circular office

  the deputy warden swung about stif-
fening as he recognized me his hand
shot to a flame-pistol and i flashed the
official emblem before his suspicious eyes

  he acknowledged the symbol with a
salute but he was far from satisfied
what is it he asked

  de berrie wishes to interview pro-
fessor woodruff immediately he and
muir are without

  so they were-in a sense

  why did not muir come in person
you yourself are a prisoner

  and the fact that im free and hold
this emblem of authority should convince
you i retorted sharply however it
makes no difference i will call de ber-
rie and i stepped toward the door

  a voice screamed through the speak-
ing-tube

  hes killed muir and de berrie hold
him while i get help

  akridge instantly i realized what had
happened coward-like he had fled at
the first sign of trouble stowed himself
away on the w-r and i had brought him
safely back to earth there to undo all that
i had fought for so desperately

i lunged swift as light my hand clutch-
ing the wardens wrist as his fingers
curled about the butt of the flame-pistol
we struggled furiously but mine was the
effort of despair with the fate of a great
cause depending on it slowly i twisted
his arm back while the sweat of death
itself broke out on our foreheads the
pistol dropped from nerveless fingers and
i snatched it in a flash and stabbed a ray
of flame at him that burned him down
like a smoking straw i pressed the con-
trol button pulled down the porcelain
lever that operated the corridor panel a
moment later the haggard figure of
woodruff wide-eyed with amazement ap-
peared in the opening

   there was no time to explain i rushed
him to the door-and crashed full tilt into
a man in the brown uniform of an inter-
national guard my pistol blazed a split
second before his own and he fell his life
burned out in a fierce gust of flame but
the ray from his own weapon seared my
hand and i involuntarily dropped the
weapon almost at akridges feet

   before i could leap he would have the
weapon but my arm in recoiling from
the hurt of the burn had brushed the
ovoid in my pocket and in a single move-
ment i snatched it and smashed it full in
his white face as he looked up phosphor-
escent slime streamed over him a slime
that contacting with the oxygen in the
atmosphere burst into flame he screamed
once horribly and slumped a crumpling
pillar of white fire

   i rushed woodruff to the space-flyer
and slammed home the air-lock as the
courtyard filled with reserve guards who
hurried toward the dwindling cinder of
what had once been a traitor

  we shot through the atmosphere into
the freedom of space the colonies were
safe
vhe whistle

by ralph milne farley

ithe story of a strident siren that brought a whole city to the verge of madness

-a bizarre extravaganza

police commissioner god-
frey grimly picked up the ringing
telephone-set from his desk

  if this is another call about that damn
whistle he announced i believe i shall
gocoocoo

  then he lifted the receiver from its
hook and placed it to his ear

  hello said he police commis-
sioner speaking

  now mr commissioner said a
high-pitched female voice over the wire
cant you do something about that whis-
tle you see-

  slam went the receiver he saw all
right then he rang for his secretary

  miss burns he directed crisply
when she arrived will you please go out
to our telephone desk just as fast as you
can travel and tell the phone girl to ring
me herself immediately and not to give
me back that outside call which i just
hung up on do you get me then
toddle

  miss burns toddled

  in a minute the commissioners phone
rang again again he answered it but
this time it was not the raucous voice of
the previous call

  instead he heard in sweet musical
tones this is the phone girl commis-
sioner and i understood your orders all
right not to put any more calls through to
you about the whistle but that last call

was the mayors wife so i thought-

  good god he exclaimed why
didnt you say so in the first place try
and get her back again for me like a good
girl

     

  here she is now said the sweet voice
then again the strident female accents
mr commissioner they cut us off this
is mrs ransome wife of mayor ran-
some you know cant you do some-
thing to stop that awful whistle

  what awful whistle he inquired
sparring for time

  havent you heard it asked mrs
ransome in surprize then but i sup-
pose you are too far downtown its driv-
ing us all crazy up in the residential sec-
tion its been blowing steadily all morn-
ing and it sounds as though it was slight-
ly off the pitch or something a horrible
grating sound isnt there a law against
factories and factory-whistles in residen-
tial districts i thought we had a zoning
ordinance or something

  what direction is it in he inquired
its just in the direction of my sewing-
room windows she replied lets see
thats away from downtown so it must
be north yes im sure its due north
very well madam he promised
ill put detectives on it at once and have
it stopped its an outrage

  thank you so much she murmured
good-bye

  and she hung up so did he he
wiped the perspiration from his forehead

  it was indeed an outrage all day
long his telephone had been kept ringing
with complaints about that confounded
whistle-complaints from frantic women
women who became more and more fran-
tic as the day wore on

  finally the commissioner had put a
stop-order on all such calls he could
the whistle



on the curb sat a man with his
feet in the gutter and both hands to
his ears a disheveled woman ran
by screaming pursued by a police-
man

hear the whistle himself through the open
windows of the city hall it was an an-
noying nerve-racking sort of a whistle
but it hadnt really gotten on his nerves so
much as had all these women who had
kept phoning him about it

  undoubtedly some factory-siren had
become stuck its owners were in the best
position of any one to fix it and undoubt-
edly were taking the proper steps it
might stop any moment now so what
business was it of his to interfere


weird tales

   that is to say what business was it of
his until the mayors wife butted in her
interest in the whistle altered the situa-
tion in an instant for commissioner god-
freys job depended upon his remaining
in the good graces of mayor ransome

  so the commissioner rang for the
chief of the bureau of criminal investi-
gation captain atwater that official
promptly reported

  atwater demanded mr godfrey
what have you done toward locating that
awful whistle

  nothing much sir replied the cap-
tain with a grin all stations were in-
structed early this morning to have all
patrolmen report whether or not the
whistle was on his beat all reported
that it was not so i dropped the matter
why

  atwater asserted the commissioner
solemnly this has become serious the
mayors wife-

   hell interrupted the other suddenly
becoming interested

  yes continued godfrey the old
vixen herself got after me she just
phoned if we dont stop that whistle at
once you and i had better start out to
look for another job

   i have it exclaimed the bureau chief
brightening well have each station lo-
cate it by compass and then well plot all
the lines on a map

  bully exclaimed the commissioner
ringing for his secretary

as miss burns entered he fired at her
- take this rush telephonic orders
to all stations the sergeant in charge
will get out on the station-house roof at
once with a compass note the exact direc-
tion of that damn whistle-strike out the
word damn miss burns-of that whis-
tle and phone the direction to the com-
missioner personally at gty hall end

of order and tell em to make it snappy
and miss burns as soon as youve typed
that and given it to the phone girl bring
me in the police map you know the one
i mean the big map out of the directory
pasted on a sheet of cardboard with all
the stations on it in red now toddle

  miss burns toddled

   well need a protractor asserted at-
water

  a what

  a protractor one of those things
you measure angles with

  well have to make one then re-
plied the commissioner anyhow they
wont be reporting by angles will they
itll be north and south and east-south-
west and all that sort of rot wont it

  i suppose so agreed the captain
lets make one of them that way then
so the two officials were hard at work
trying to remember the points of the com-
pass and put them down on paper when
miss burns returned with the map for-
tunately there was an elaborate and beau-
tifully drawn compass in the lower right-
hand corner of the city map so the two
men traced it onto a sheet of thin paper
then they got out a pencil and a long
ruler and stood ready

  pretty soon the first report came in
the whistle is due east of station 

  so they drew a line on the map due
east from station 

  scarcely had they done this when sta-
tion  reported that the whistle was about
northwest of there that line was like-
wise drawn

  aha exclaimed the commissioner
the lines cross exactly at joness soap
factory in district  the dirty pup he
headed the citizens committee against
mayor ransome in the last election just
wait till i send a squad over from station
 and put mr jones in the cooler for in-
decent disturbance
the whistle



  he picked up the phone to call station
 but there was an incoming call on the
wire station  reports that the whistle
is southeast

  plot it down atwater commanded
commissioner godfrey

  atwater did so the new line crossed
each of the other two several blocks away
from the jones factory

  um said the commissioner pursing
up his lips not so good

  so instead of calling station  and di-
recting the arrest of mr jones he called
station  back again

  sergeant said he commissioner
speaking try that direction again
youre pretty rotten

  the two men waited nervously for a
few moments through the open win-
dows they could distinctly hear that awful
off-pitch whistle newsboys began cry-
ing extras about the whistle in the streets
outside

  then the sergeant at station  phoned
apologetically i guess we were all wet
chief the whistle is due northsast
atwater plotted that direction then ex-
claimed my god sir worse and more
of it it doesnt cross the other two lines
at all now

  commissioner godfrey was just about
to call station  a third time and give the
sergeant there a real dressing-down when
he was interrupted by the rapidly succes-
sive reports from practically all the other
stations

  as fast as these reports came in at-
water drew the lines on the map

  finally there was a lull in the incoming
calls and the commissioner turned to
view the handiwork of his assistant then
he gasped the lines went every which
way all over the map none except the
original two came anywhere near the
jones soap factory

  for a few moments the two men

stared speechless at the map they
werent even thinking they were mere-
ly staring with the same dumb paralysis
of fear which affects a stupid student in
an examination they were worrying
about the problem rather than thinking
about it

  at last the commissioner broke the si-
lence

  we must think said he deter-
minedly

  a good idea assented the other hur-
riedly

  godfrey glared at him

  then i have it exclaimed atwater
i remember reading once in the sunday
paper in an article on sounds that the
human ears cant tell whether a sound is
in front or behind a man trying to lo-
cate a sound turns his head until the
sound comes either directly in front of
him or directly behind him

  well what good is that going to do
us asked the commissioner

  its going to solve our problem thats
what its going to do replied the other
confidently well run all our lines just
the opposite way from each station too
this will give us a point through which
one line either the forward one or the
backward one from each station will
pass come on lets go

  quickly the lines on the map were ex-
tended backward but still the helter-
skelter there was hardly a ward of the
city that did not have at least one inter-
section of lines in it any one of these
intersections might be the true location of
the whistle thus the whistle might be
almost anywhere in the big city

  and still its awful screech resounded
through the open windows and still the
newsboys cried their extras in the streets
below

  there was just one ray of sunshine to
the whole situation two more of the lines


weird tales

passed very close to old joness factory

  miss bums stuck her head through the
door

the mayors wife is on the phone
again she announced what shall i

    

  the commissioner passed his hand
across his worried brow

  tell her to go jump in the lake he
exclaimed then no no tell her that
im out with captain atwater tell her
that weve located the whistle approx-
imately and hope to have it stopped very
soon now

  very well sir replied the girl and
withdrew

  commissioner godfrey seized the
phone and called station 

  sergeant he bellowed send a squad
over to the jones factory on the double-
quick tell them to stop that whistle at
once and if that old fool jones is there
himself arrest him as a suspicious char-
acter or a public nuisance or something
and phone me as soon as you get back
step on it

  then turning to atwater he an-
nounced as soon as we get that whistle
stopped the sergeants who reported the
wrong directions are going to catch hell

miss burns entered with an assort-
ment of afternoon papers the
two men pounced on them the main
news sections were chiefly devoted to the
whistle there were several columns of
statements as to the direction from which
the sound appeared to come these direc-
tions if plotted on a map would have
been even more helter-skelter than the
lines already plotted in the commission-
ers office

  i guess our sergeants arent so crazy
after all asserted atwater

the telephone rang it was station 
reporting the whistle isnt at the jones

factory sir their boiler is shut down so
it couldnt be them

  hell exclaimed the commissioner
mrs ransome will be calling up again
in a few minutes lets beat it out to
lunch before she does

  so the two men left the office together
when they reached the steps of city hall
the wail of the whistle first really began
to get under their skins its sound
seemed to permeate the atmosphere to
be omnipresent coming from no partic-
ular direction no wonder the police
sergeants had had difficulty in locating it

  the sound just barely missed having
the same effect on the two officials as bit-
ing the tines of a fork or the scratching of
a gritty chalk on a blackboard they
could easily imagine its effect on persons
whose ears were attuned to a slightly dif-
ferent pitch than theirs

  on the curb in front of them sat a man
with his feet in the gutter and both hands
to his ears rocking to and fro and moan-
ing softly a disheveled woman rushed
by screaming pursued by a policeman a
full ambulance dashed down the street
adding the clangor of its gong to the gen-
eral confusion

  as the commissioner and his assistant
walked across the sidewalk to the waiting
police car they passed an old man who
was chewing his finger-nails and mutter-
ing to himself

  my god exclaimed the commis-
sioner if this keeps up half the city
will be loony before night and here
was i worrying about my own troubles

  the trip to the club was difficult traf-
fic had become disorganized the driv-
ers were nervous and frantic and the little
whistles of the traffic cops seemed to blend
soundlessly with the all-pervasive larger
sound

  even during the short time that the two
officials were at lunch affairs had become
the whistle

 

noticeably worse on their way back to
city hall they noticed that a larger per-
centage of the autoists and pedestrians
were acting erratically they even saw
one traffic cop suddenly put his hands to
his ears leave his post and run frantically
up the street like a hunted animal

by the time they reached city hall
again they both were in a mood for
drastic action

  what do you do in cases like this any-
how demanded commissioner godfrey

  i call up the university replied the
bureau chief lets see what depart-
ment would know about this when we
had that last murder mystery you remem-
ber the dead body with no cause of death
i called up the professor of anatomy

and when-

  never mind what you did once be-
fore bellowed godfrey what are you
going to do now what do i have you
for anyhow

  lets see mused captain atwater
the trouble is a sound ill call the pro-
fessor of sound that ought to be in the
physics department oughtnt it

  search me replied the commission-
er handing over the phone hop to it
captain atwater got the university and
soon arranged for professor long the
great physicist author of long on sound
to come right over to headquarters

  then the two men read the latest pa-
pers and listened to the whistle miss
bums entered

  said she the mayors wife is on the
phone again sir she says that the whis-
tle didnt stop as you said it would and
what are you going to do about it

  a grim calmness settled over the com-
missioner

  tell her he replied that captain
atwater and i are still out and that you
will give me her message when we re-
turn

  the girl withdrew but in a moment
was back to announce professor long

  the professor was a keen forceful-
looking rather youngish man not at all
the comic-paper professorial type

  yes he had heard the whistle who
hadnt no he had no theories about it
it hadnt bothered him any but if any
one wished it investigated-

  the mayors wife wants it investi-
gated-and stopped bellowed godfrey

  what has been done already asked
doctor long calmly

  so they told him and showed him the
map

  um said he

  then he went into action he phoned
the armory roused the non-com in
charge inquired the name and office tel-
ephone number of the commanding offi-
cer of the local anti-aircraft company
phoned him and had him assemble the
men of his sound-ranging unit post-haste
in a surprizingly short time they began
to drift in to headquarters they were
enthusiastic at this opportunity to put their
training to some practical use

  the young lieutenant in command ex-
plained the apparatus to the commission-
er they had three sets of instruments
these could be placed at three strategic
points throughout the city each would
give exactly the direction of the sound
from that spot to the nearest degree the
triangle of error where the three lines in-
tersected would be almost negligibly
small and easily adjusted

  where are your three sets of appara-
tus asked the commissioner

  right here outside city hall sir
mounted on three army trucks replied
the young lieutenant

  who draws the lines on the maps

  my plotting-squad sir they could
work right here sir on your map

  very well said the commissioner


weird tales

go to it set up your instruments in
front of stations   and  and phone in
your results to here from those stations

the young army lieutenant gave the
necessary orders and all of his men
departed except the plotting-squad and
himself

  commissioner godfrey phoned instruc-
tions to the three police stations to co-op-
erate then they waited while that awful
whistle still shrieked outside

  in a very few minutes the three direc-
tions came in over the wire and were
duly plotted on the map

  but the three lines didnt intersect at
all instead they diverged away from
the common center

  run them backward suggested the
commissioner gazing longingly at the
spot on the map which marked the loca-
tion of the jones soap factory

  but professor long interposed no
that isnt possible with a sound-ranger
they arent like human ears a sound-
ranger gives the actual direction

  and the young army lieutenant nodded
assent

  then said he perhaps the whistle is
running round all over town and my
three squads didnt take their readings
simultaneously may i sir

  he indicated the phone the com-
missioner nodded anything to keep the
line busy so that mayor ransomes wife
couldnt call up

  so the young army officer phoned each
of his three instrument squads calibrated
their watches to his and ordered them to
range on the whistle at exactly five min-
utes past

  they did so and their results when
plotted this time again diverged but in
three different directions from before

  every one looked glum except profes-
sor long whose face suddenly brightened

  i have an idea he exclaimed

  every one else brightened

  but he continued i cant tell you
what it is until i try it out

   every ones face fell

  im going home announced the com-
missioner heavily my home phone has
a secret number and so the mayors wife
cant reach me there atwater tell miss
bums to tell all callers that im out with
you working on the case and then
youd better scatter too good-bye
gentlemen thank you all for trying to
help me 

  there was almost a sneer in that word
trying

  may i have that number mr com-
missioner asked the professor i may
have something to report

  godfrey scribbled a number ori a card
and handed it over then he and the
professor left the others tried the
sound-ranging several times more but the
direction-lines remained practically the
same as the last time and totally failed to
converge

  finally they gave it up and disbanded

the whistle continued to grate on the
nerves of the now frantic city the
evening papers reported more and more
mental cases admitted to the hospitals
and a general exodus of those who had
or could afford transportation

  practically every evening paper carried
an editorial petulantly demanding action
by the city government

  commissioner godfrey-risking get-
ting mrs ransome on the phone-called
up mayor ransome for some time over
the phone they discussed how best to
reply to these newspaper broadsides the
whistle was beginning to get on even
their iron nerves they felt the impend-
ing downfall of their administration if
they did not act quickly and properly
the whistle



   finally they issued a brief joint state-
ment challenging the newspapers to lo-
cate the whistle themselves if they were
so smart and promising to suppress it
and to inflict dire penalties upon the per-
petrator the very moment that any one
would tell them where to find it but
lest this retort be considered to constitute
merely passing the buck they added that
the best scientific mind in the city namely
professor long of the university author
of long on sound had been employed on
the case

   this statement silenced the newspapers
although it did not silence the whistle
and it had another effect

   shortly after the extras containing this
statement were on the street the com-
missioners phone rang

  when he answered the call a strange
voice informed him this is the whistle
speaking

  indignantly he slammed down the re-
ceiver wasnt the situation bad enough
without practical jokers butting in

  but his caller was persistent again
the phone rang and again came the mes-
sage this is the whistle

  commissioner godfrey called the chief
operator identified himself and directed
that if that call came again it was to be
traced and chief inspector atwater be
notified rush then godfrey phoned at-
water to stand ready to rush a motorcycle
policeman to arrest the person who dared
to trifle with this serious situation

  the call came again and godfrey let
the man talk so as to give the telephone
company plenty of time to trace the con-
nection and to give atwater plenty of
time to make the arrest

  this is the whistle said the voice
i am much displeased that you have put
professor long on my trail unless you
recall him at once i shall not be respon-
sible for the outcome

  just to humor the man and hold him
on the line as long as possible godfrey
asked and if we recall the professor
will you stop your infernal noise

  all in due time replied the voice
the city has not yet been reduced to
quite the abject terror that is necessary to
my purposes when the time is ripe i
shall phone you again and make a prop-
osition to you

  commissioner godfrey argued with the
man and strung him along on every pos-
sible pretext for fhe hope was slowly
dawning on the commissioner that per-
haps this man might actually have some-
thing to do with the whistle after all and
that through his arrest they might get a
clue as to the location of the whistle

  but finally the man after giving
another warning as to professor long
rang off

  instantly the commissioner called the
chief operator of the telephone company

  did you trace that call and notify at-
water he eagerly inquired

  no call was reported here replied
the phone official just a moment i
will investigate and call you back hang
up please

  so godfrey hung up and waited impa-
tiently

  in a moment the chief operator report-
ed the girl on your switchboard says
that no call has been put through to you
in the past half-hour

  the commissioner stormed and argued
but it was no use the official stuck to
his story so all that could be done was
to caution him to be more careful next
time

  commissioner godfrey was not given
much leisure to ponder on this latest de-
velopment for his phone rang again
this time it was professor long his
voice was vibrant with excitement

  ive got them he panted but they


weird tales

nearly got me i know what the whistle
is now its a most diabolical plot against
the city on the part of some desperate and
brilliant criminals i can stop it and im
going to but it may cost me my life
its got to be handled alone and single-
handed

  where are you interrupted the com-
missioner

  if i told you youd interfere re-
plied the professor good-bye

  and he hung up

  frantically the commissioner rang the
chief operator

  did you trace the call this time he
asked

  yes replied the official and i noti-
fied atwater his motorcycle cop is on
the way there already

  then he gave godfrey the location a
drug-store on the outskirts of the city
the commissioner hurried there in his
own car

  he found atwater already in charge
questioning the druggist and all other
occupants of the store and every one in
the immediate neighborhood operatives
were combing the surrounding streets
but although professor long had been
seen in the drug-store no further traces of
him could be found

  at last the excitement died down all
the operatives came in every one who
could possibly give any information had
been interviewed without results a lull
descended over the group of policemen
and police officials

  and then the commissioner made a
great discovery

  why he exclaimed the whistle
has stopped

  so it had the administration was
saved

  but no trace of professor long was
ever found

 tntnock again i told croft already he replied either these
 theres always some one up in transylvanians sleep like the dead or-
 these village inns and its not what the devil
 midnight yet	whats the matter i inquired he

 tve almost hammered the door down was shaking his hand ruefully

                                                                                  


weird tales

  bruised my knuckles on something on
the door he said irritably he detached
it from the door then passed it to me i
saw that it was a little wooden cross a
mighty inconvenient way of expressing
religious fervor exclaimed croft as he
knocked again

  i looked up and down the white road
gleaming in the starlight along it were
strung the score or so of high-peaked
frame cottages that formed the village of
kranzak croft and i had counted as we
had swung through the transylvanian
hills all day and evening on getting here
a late supper and lodging for the night

  but now kranzak seemed to offer small
prospect of either supper or bed for from
the shuttered windows of its houses
showed no lights and our hammering at
the inns door had produced no response
we had heard voices inside the inn as we
had approached it but at our first knock
they had become abruptly silent

  croft annoyed by hurting his hand on
the cross called out now in our defective
hungarian let us in this is an inn
isnt it

  an elderly tremulous voice answered
it is the inn of kranzak yes but it opens
to no one tonight

  why not my companion demanded

  the same voicfe answered because
this is the night of vampires sirs the
night of st george when all those who
were in life vampires and servants of evil
rise again to work evil until dawn no
door here in kranzak will open until
dawn

  night of the devil i exclaimed
what kind of craziness is this

  croft laughed turning from the door
no use barton weve run into their
superstitions and it looks like no lodging
for us tonight

  a different and shriller voice called
from inside if you want lodging go on

to wieslant it told us and was followed
by a buzz of three or four voices within

   we stepped back into the road baffled
looking along the villages houses each
had some sort of cross at its door and
each was still dark and without invitation

   well it looks as if we go on to wies-
lant wherever it may be i said

wieslant-i dont remember it on the
map croft said but these villages are
all pretty close together so it cant be far
forward march then i ordered and
we started along the road in the starlight

  the night of st george-night of
the vampires i repeated as we swung
out of the village and on through the
dark pine woods was that whole vil-
lage sitting behind locked doors in fear
of that old vampire superstition croft
he nodded its a very deep belief
here in transylvania these transylva-
nians believe implicitly that when people
die who have sold themselves to evil they
become not dead but undead-become
vampires who rise from their tombs by
night to suck blood and life from others
ive read something of the belief of
course i said but i thought vampires
could rise any night between sunset and
dawn i didnt know this st georges
night was the only night in the year in
which they could rise

  croft laughed theres a distinction
between vampires barton all vampires
can rise from their graves each night until
priests have carried out over their graves
the binding and exorcising rites that pris-
on them there but on this one night
each year st georges night even these
prisoned vampires who far outnumber
the others can rise and work evil until
dawn

  which is why st georges night
finds them locked up back there at kran-
zak i said shaking my head and
those crosses on the doors i asked
vampire village

jerking a thumb toward the little wooden
one croft had passed me which i had
thrust into my breast-pocket

  he smiled to protect them from the
vampires tonight of course a cross is
the one sure weapon against vampires
you know the one thing they fear its
all mighty interesting this vampire super-
stition

  and mighty inconvenient for us i
added if this wieslants people are as
terrorized by vampires tonight as kran-
zaks were out of luck for sure

we hitched our knapsacks higher on
our shoulders and bent to the
steady task of walking the white road
wound through dense forests up a long
slope that seemed a pass between the big
hills ahead and to the right there was
no moon but the thin starlight outlined
the road clearly in its windings through
the dark pine woods

   as we swung on for steady mile after
mile it came to me that the very gloom-
iness of this somber transylvanian land-
scape must be at the bottom of its peoples
fearful beliefs it would be easy to be-
lieve i speculated that in the midnight
darkness of the hills about us supernatural
beings of evil were moving loosed this
one night from the tomb

   we could see once or twice black flying-
shapes of considerable size moving in the
starlight low over distant woods and
while it was apparent enough to croft
and me that these must be hawks or owls
searching the night forests for prey i
could well see i thought how any tran-
sylvanians seeing them would believe
them vampires abroad on this their night

  crofts voice at last interrupted my
speculations there are the lights of a
village down there he announced
wieslants i suppose

  we had reached the rim of a bowl-

shaped valley some miles across that was
encircled by the hills down in the
darkness at this bowls center gleamed a
little pattern of lights with at one spot
the redder glow of fires

  nothing shut up about wieslant ap-
parently i said with rising spirits we
may get supper and a bed tonight after
all

  looks as though theres a chance of it
at any rate croft agreed

  we swung down into the bowl-like val-
ley toward the villages lights wieslant
it was apparent as we entered it was a
place unusually ancient for the houses
along its little streets were more antique in
appearance than any we had yet seen
they had the grotesquely carved scroll-
work and odd-shaped doors and windows
common to the houses of the section a
few hundred years ago

  these houses were illuminated with
yellow candle-light but we could see no
occupants in them as we passed among
them the reason for this was explained
when we neared the open green at the vil-
lages center for large fires were burn-
ing there swift gay music was audible
and gathered round the fire-lit green and
dancing to the music were the people of
wieslant

  as croft and i approached we could
see these people only as black shapes dan-
cing between us and the glowing fires
their dark forms spun with such swift-
ness that to us with the light in our eyes
they seemed to leave the ground and
whirl through the air in the mad rush of
the dance croft and i drew nearer and
stopped in the shadows outside the fire-lit
greens circle watching with astonishment

  a half-dozen fires spilled ruddy light
across the green and around each fire
one of the strange dances was going on
the dancers were clad the men in out-
landish brilliant jackets and tight trous-


weird tales

ers the women in similarly bright skirts
and bodices the festal attire of transyl-
vanian peasants yet these costumes were
of an older and odder style than any
others we had seen

  around the greens edge in the fire-
light were a hundred or two villagers
watching and applauding the dance
they were clad like the dancers there be-
ing in fact no modern dress visible at
one place was a peasant orchestra of
stringed instruments pouring out the wild
swift music beside this a tall white-
mustached and fierce-faced oldster was
calling above the din to the dancers as
they whirled and spun

  i had never seen such a strange picture
of mad gayety and croft and i watched
marvelling from back in the shadows
these anciently dressed villagers seemed
flinging themselves into the merriment of
the dance with utter abandon the eyes
of dancers and spectators alike glowed
crimson apparently from reflected fire-
light

  suddenly one of the spectators glimpsed
croft and me back in the dark he ut-
tered a stabbing cry and instantly all of
them were rushing toward us

in our momentary stupefaction it almost
seemed that they were hurtling through
the air to attack us a crowded vision of
crimson eyes and white-gleaming teeth
but when almost upon croft and me they
stopped short as though struck back

  they encircled us giving vent to a bab-
ble of excited cries in a hungarian dialect
that was almost beyond our understand-
ing while their excited gleaming eyes
held upon us the din was immense

  excitable beggars arent they said
croft can you make out what theyre
shouting about

  not while theyre all crying at once
i answered whats the matter with

them i thought for a moment they were
attacking us

  these transylvanians are all an excit-
able bunch he said this looks like the
head-man of the village coming and he
ought to be able to calm them down

  it was the tall white-mustached old-
ster who had been calling to the dancers
who now shouldered through the throng
toward us he was dressed like the rest
in the brilliant ancient festal costume
which set off his tall figure well enough
he bowed to us his eyes sharp upon ours

  welcome to wieslant sirs he ad-
dressed us in the oddly-twisted dialect of
the others we did not expect strangers
here tonight

  im sorry if weve intruded on your
festal celebrations croft told him we
didnt mean to do so

  the other waved the apology aside smil-
ingly my people here-i am mihai
hallos head-man of wieslant-see but
few strangers and so are excited when any
visit our little village

  well its not by intention we came
croft said back at the last village
kranzak every one was locked up for
fear of vampires they must have been
afraid we were vampires ourselves for
they wouldnt let us in but told us to go
on to wieslant

  hallos smile deepened and a laugh ran
through the crowd kranzaks people
are much afraid of vampires on this night
it is true the head-man said for not far
from kranzak was located the vampire
village

  vampire village croft repeated in-
terrogatively but hallos waved his hand
it is a belief in this part of transylvania
-i will tell you the story later it keeps
many villages in fear on this night
well im glad at any rate it doesnt
keep you of wieslant locked up i re-

                  w t-
vampire village



marked we didnt fancy walking all
night

  youll find excellent accommodations
here at wieslant hallos assured me
indeed you could have come at no better
time than tonight

  again the chuckling laugh ran through
the crowd though i could see nothing
humorous in the words these gleaming-
eyed strangely dressed villagers were
making both croft and myself rather un-
comfortable by their staring at us from
all sides and hallos must have seen this

  our inn is over there at the greens
edge he said may i not lead you
there

  we protested against his taking the
trouble but with true transylvanian cour-
tesy he waved our protests aside hallos
motioned the villagers to make way for
us and was turning again toward us when
i bumped awkwardly into him face to
face

  to my surprize he staggered and fell
to his knees his hand on his heart and his
face contorted by a spasm of agony he
regained his feet though before we had
time to help him up and i apologized as
best i could for my clumsiness

  it was not your fault he said with
hand still on his breast but i have a
weakness here and the thing in your
breast-pocket prodded me when we col-
lided

  i looked down and saw projecting from
my breast-pocket the little wooden cross
croft had handed me at kranzak which
i had forgotten im very sorry i said
it was stupid of me to run into you

   hallos smiled and shook his head but i
noticed as we started through the crowd
toward the inn that he kept croft between
him and myself apparently he did not
intend trusting himself again to my awk-
wardness

  and as we moved through the gay-
    w t-

dressed villagers who parted to allow us
passage i even thought that they shrank
rather farther away from me than from
croft it was a little discomfiting to me

  hallos talked on urbanely as he led us
to the inn the music behind us had re-
commenced and the villagers were again
dancing by the time we came to the an-
cient-looking inn at the greens edge

we followed the head-man into
the stone-paved broad-beamed tav-
ern-room a great fire flickered in a wall-
fireplace and behind th small bar at the
rooms end the fat and white-haired inn-
keeper was serving bottles of queer
twisted shapes to a dozen gay-costumed
men and women

  they had been engaged in wild talk
and laughter as we entered but fell dead
silent at sight of hallos and ourselves
staring toward us i was struck again by
the trick of the firelight falling upon these
peoples faces to make their eyes seem
somehow crimson-lit

  the fat innkeeper came forward and
hallos made introduction

  this is kallant innkeeper of wies-
lant and as excellent a one as can be
found in transylvania he told us smil-
ingly he will be glad to see you for it
is not often he lodges strangers

  not often admitted the fat kallant
laughing in a strange way in fact it is
not often that i have custom of any kind
you will wish two rooms sirs

  oh one room will do for both of us
croft answered were more concerned
about supper than the room right now
if you will do us an honor hallos
interjected our wieslant festivities on
this feast-night continue all night and
some of us leading villagers always have
supper here at two oclock you would
honor us by joining us

well be honored to do so croft


weird tales

said its almost two now so barton
and i had better brush up a little

  i will show you the room sirs said
kallant turning with a candle toward the
narrow stair that rose back in the shadows

  we were entering the dark stairway
with him when hallos voice stopped us
he was gesturing with an amused smile
toward the wooden cross that still pro-
jected from my breast-pocket

  that emblem of piety were best left
in your room sir he told me smilingly
on this night piety is forgotten here and
we think but of merriment

  croft and i laughed its not really
mine i told the head-man but of course
ill leave it i dont want to be the skel-
eton at your feast

  as we went up the dark narrow stair-
way after the fat kallant i heard a sud-
den babble of wild voices break out in the
tavern-room we had just quitted there
cut across them and silenced them the
sharp voice of hallos and i smiled at this
evidence that our courtly host could play
the tyrant over his simple subjects when
so inclined

  the stair led up into a long hall dimly
lit by one or two candles in wall-sockets
along it there were doors but half vis-
ible in the shadows and kallant led us to
one of these and opened it gesturing in-
side as he placed his candle in a socket
inside the door

  this will suit you sirs he told us
its a little musty-we dont often have
custom here-but should be comfortable
enough

  its quite all right we assured him
tell hallos well be down in a few mo-
ments he bowed and withdrew we
looked about us

  musty is right i commented
looks as if it hadnt been used for cen-
turies

  the room in fact was covered with

  dust that lay thick over the floor and fur-
niture and old-fashioned wooden bed
through the odd-shaped windows we
could glimpse the green outside where
the fires still were burning and the dark
shadows of the dancers whirling to the
wild music

  croft and i spruced up as well as pos-
sible and then left the room when we
emerged from the dark stairway into the
inns tavern-room again we found the
head-man hallos there with two dozen
or more men and women they were
without exception dressed in the antique
festal costumes to which we were now ac-
customed

  hallos almost rushed to meet us as we
entered the tavern-room his eyes alight
but a little from us he stopped staring at
my breast

  i	looked down and saw that i had for-
gotten to discard the little wooden cross
from that pocket oh im sorry i
said but i suppose having the thing
doesnt really matter

  of course not he told me courteous-
ly will you not meet some of our peo-
ple these are my own two daughters

  he made introductions and we chatted
as best we could in our halting hungarian
with the gay groups i was somewhat
chagrined i admit to see that they tended
to gather around croft and to avoid me
recalling the head-mans words i sup-
posed they judged from the cross project-
ing from my pocket that i was some strict
and serious devotee

  croft saw my isolation and shot amused
glances at me now and then for he was
making great progress with the two bril-
liant-cheeked beauties hallos had intro-
duced as his daughters hallos himself
talked with me though at a little distance
until the fat kallant appeared from anoth-
er room to announce that the supper was
ready
vampire village



  we passed into the candle-lit dining-
hall where a long table laden with tran-
sylvanian dishes and wines awaited us
hallos seated himself at the tables end
with croft and the younger daughter at
his right and me and the elder daughter
at his left but before i could address a
word to this elder sister she pulled her
chair as far as possible from me and
turned her back upon me to talk to her
other neighbor

the supper was gay and croft and the
younger sister opposite me were of
the gayest though i was feeling some-
what chagrined at the cold treatment these
people accorded me i made up for it by
attacking the spicy foods and strong wines
with vigor nor was croft much behind
me since we had not eaten for a dozen
hours

  the foods and wines were as delicious
as i had ever tasted but seemed strangely
lacking in filling qualities in fact after
disposing of a half-dozen dishes and sev-
eral glasses i felt really as hungry as on
beginning yet though croft too looked
a little puzzled the others at table seemed
not to notice it

  the room rang with laughter chatter
and clink of glasses with echoes now and
then of the dance-music from outside
kallant hovered about to see that all were
served and at the tables end hallos was
the picture of a courteous host

  during a lull in the chatter of voices
croft addressed him you said youd
tell us about the vampire village located
near kranzak he reminded id like to
hear the story if the rest dont mind

  hallos smiled and i saw suppressed
mirth on die faces of our companions
kallant grinning in the background
why all here know it well the head-
man said but if it would interest

  at our quick assurance he went on
we of transylvania have for many cen-
turies known that vampires do exist we
have known that men and women who
sell themselves in life to the forces of evil
do not when they die become dead but
undead vampires by day vampires lie
as though dead in their graves but by
night rise as though living and suck blood
and life from whatever unprotected peo-
ple they encounter

  we transylvanians know also that
against the cross vampires are powerless
so whenever a vampires grave is detected
in this country priests perform over it
ceremonies of the cross that bind the vam-
pire in his grave yet even vampires so
bound and prisoned can on one night of
the year the night of st george still rise
and work until dawn

  almost two hundred and fifty years
ago there was in this section of transyl-
vania a village located not far from kran-
zak and this village near kranzak came
to be haunted by vampires as no village
had ever been before the forces of evil
worked there until in the graves of that
village lay some hundreds of vampires
who came forth each night

  it was then a vampire village the
living people left in it fled to kranzak
and other places but the vampires re-
mained each day that village lay de-
serted and untenanted beneath the sun
but each night the vampires rose to more
through and inhabit the village as though
alive venturing often to attack people in
near-by villages

   so at last the people of the surround-
ing section came with many priests to put
an end to this vampire village over
each grave the priests carried out their
binding rites prisoning each vampire
thus from then on though no living
people ever again inhabited it the vam-
pires came forth no more by night save on


weird tales

that one night each year the night of st
george when all vampires are freed on
that night the vampire village again
swarms until dawn with its undead in-
habitants

  and since the night of st george is
tonight croft smiled they feared back
in kranzak that we two were from the
vampire village

  that is so said hallos also smiling
for despite the centuries that have passed
they of kranzak and the other villages
still fear this night of the year when the
vampire village wakes to life again

  but you here in wieslant tonight
dont seem to have much fear of the vil-
lage of vampires i said they all
laughed at that

  it is because st george is our patron
and so on his festal night we have his
protection hallos explained and can
give ourselves up to merrymaking without
fear

  croft shook his head strange the
power of some of these beliefs he said
yet they fit with your ancient houses and
costumes somehow

  the elder hallos girl laughed these
costumes we wear on this festal night all
of us but they must seem very odd to
you she told croft

  they seem beautiful he told her
yet they make me feel as though barton
and i had in some way strayed into the
past

  our dances are ancient ones too on
this night she said will you not come
with my sister and me to watch them
her invitation so pointedly excluded
me that croft shot a grinning glance at
me as he accepted coming along bar-
ton he asked as we all rose

  i shook my head im going up-
stairs and get some much-needed sleep
i told him its almost morning you
know

  our company passed back into the tav-
ern-room croft between the two sisters
and i with hallos at my side it was
evident to me that croft had made an
impression on the two gay-clad beauties
for their eyes and little white teeth
gleamed alike as they laughed up to him
their hands tightening on his arms in a
caressing and almost possessive manner

  ill be up shortly barton croft told
me as they turned to the door i could
stand some sleep myself all right

  sleep-there is enough of sleep in
the world exclaimed the younger sister
tonight is a festal night and not for
sleep but for life-for life

  she spoke with astounding vehemence
and with eyes really fiery rather startling
croft and myself also hallos his own
eyes crimson shot her a furious look and
at that she dropped her lashes demurely

  as croft went out with them i gave
him a meaning glance telling him not to
make a fool of himself over the two
transylvanian beauties most of the com-
pany followed them and i bade them a
general good-night to hallos and kal-
lant who remained i added my thanks
before starting up the stair

  as i went up the dark stairway i
thought i heard a quick step below and
turned but there was no one beneath i
heard hallos voice hissing to some one
evidently kallant-not yet you fool
he has it still with him

  kallants muttered answer was inau-
dible but their dispute was apparently no
affair of mine and i went on up to our
room in the dim candle-light the musty
bed was unattractive but i sat down
yawning glancing out the dusty window
the fires on the green still glowed red
but the music had stopped and the dark
shapes of the villagers seemed clustered
round some object of interest
vampire village



 loosened my collar tossing onto the
table with a smile the wooden cross
whose significance of piety had given the
villagers such a distaste for me i was
tossing our fat little blue guidebook after
it when it occurred to me to look up wies-
lants exact location in it

  croft had said that wieslant was not
on the map and i found it to be so there
being no village at all marked there be-
tween that of kranzak and the distant one
of holf somewhat puzzled i turned to
the books text but found no description of
wieslant there either and was giving up
with disgust at the inefficiency of guide-
book-makers when the name wieslant
in a footnote caught my eye

  as i started to read this i was aware
subconsciously of two things of a rush
and commotion among the dark crowd out
on the village green and of the rustling
sound of some one moving in the hall
outside my door but had thunder de-
tonated about me it could not have
aroused in me the unutterable horror that
was rising in me as i read the fine type of
the footnote

  the words seemed dancing before my
eyes -wieslant    approximately
midway between kranzak and holf   
deserted entirely in  through fear of
vampires    still called in that section
the vampire village    now almost

wholly in- and even as the terrific

truth smashed home to my reeling brain
there thrust to my ears from the green out-
side an agonized scream in crofts voice

  i leapt across the room and flung the
door open hallos and kallant stood out-
it with eyes gleaming hell-crimson at me
out of the faces of fiends the two shot
as one through the air toward me and as
they bore me backward i felt their sharp
fangs at my throat felt in my face their
breath like airs of cold corruption from
the grave

  but as i reeled backward with those two
hell-vampires upon me my outflung hand
touched the table and something on the
table that my fingers closed on instinctive-
ly and that i thrust against them it was
the little cross and as it touched them it
hurled them back across the room and
against the wall as though titanic forces
had smitten them

  with eyes red flames of hell hallos and
kallant glared from there at me as i
swayed to the door crofts scream stab-
bing again and weaker to my ears i was
flinging myself down the dark stairway
with the two black fire-eyed shapes of
hallos and kallant after me the cross still
clutched in my grasp i was reeling out
onto the green to hear again crofts muf-
fled cry

  croft was down and the madly whirl-
ing scarlet-eyed vampire throng was upon
him white teeth seeking his throat half
of them were rushing toward me black
fiend-shapes against the fires that were
dimming as a faint promise of light
showed eastward black vampire-shapes
that were about me and separating me
from croft

  they recoiled and parted as i stumbled
forward extending the cross they raged
about me like mad shadow-shapes of hell
their baffled shrieks in my ears i was
at crofts side and those upon him re-
coiled as i dropped beside him with the
cross he seemed senseless and i felt
my own senses going and the cross drop-
ping from my weakened fingers as around
us raged the ghastly vampire-horde

  they were closing upon us as the cross
slipped from my nerveless hand-the
fiend-faces of hallos and his daughters
and all the others spun closer in a mad
vista of red eyes and avid lips and sharp
white teeth-and then from the paling
east struck a gray shaft of dawn in-


weird tales

stantly it was as though gray mist envel-
oped the vampire throng and all the vil-
lage about us a mist that darkened in my
mind as i lost consciousness

  he dawnlight eastward had changed
from gray to gold when i came back
to consciousness croft was stirring weak-
ly and as he sat up i saw and picked from
the ground beside me automatically a

little wooden cross we staggered to our
feet and gazed dazedly about us

  ancient weed-grown ruins stretched in
the golden light around us there were
broken masonry outlines of building foun-
dations and in one place an enclosure of
half-visible time-worn tombstones but
there was no standing house or structure
or any sign of life croft and i stared
wordlessly wildly all the world silent
about us in the light of the morning sun

       by cristel hastings

 veiled was the moon and gray the sea

 and white was the thing that stared at me

 for a dead man hung on a gallows tree-
 veiled was the moon and gray the sea

 black was the hood they tied on his head
 as he woke from sleep and left his bed

 within that dread hour to hang dead-

  black was the hood they tied on his head

 still was the room where the hangman stood
 as quietly as a hangman could

 and little there seemed in this world of good-
 still was the room where the hangman stood

 loud was the voice of the wind outside
 where trees bent low and a raging tide
 sobbed because a man had died-

 loud was the voice of the wind outside

 dark is the room where the gallows stood
 empty the limp and tear-wet hood

 and little is left in the night of good-

 dark is the room where the gallows stood
petrified with terror the boot-
legger crouched over the open

weird tales

moore and don and lorna lie to all ap-
pearance inanimate in moores country
house among the swamps of the gulf
coast

  moore plans to restore don to life and
let him be arrested for the murder of
wells dons sole hope lies in sudh ha-
fiz a persian who was sent by the master
of white magic in persia to end moores
criminal career sudh hafiz witnesses
wellss death and wellss death-scream
arouses everybody in the apartment house

  the story continues

quickly sudh hafiz left the apart-
ment he went down not by the
elevator but by the stairs to find the desk
clerk and the elevator boys gathered in
panic and staring up through the shafts

  whats the matter asked the per-
sian

  that cry-didnt you hear it

  i heard a cry replied sudh hafiz

  and he passed rapidly out of the build-
ing while down the stairs the frightened
tenants began to run anxiously inquiring
of one another where the cry had come
from men and women huddled together
in a terrified cluster for every one had
recognized that that cry had been the cry
of death

  the lights whats the matter with
the lights they shouted

  the lights in the apartment hall were
burning dim so dim that now the group
could barely distinguish one anothers
faces

  the desk clerk was the first to recover
his self-possession he snatched up the
transmitter police headquarters quick
he shouted this is the randolph apart-
ment house somethings happened here
we think some ones been murdered and
the lights are going out all right ill
see to it

  he turned dont let any one leave the
building till the police come he shouted

see that the rear entrance is guarded
he had forgotten sudh hafiz

  something was moving among the hud-
dled guests who were increasing in num-
bers every moment as more and more
came running down the stairs whos
that stop him who is it hes mak-
ing for the door

  but who can hold a shadow dimly
they could see the outlines of a mans fig-
ure weaving through the crowd so eas-
ily as if it were impalpable they tried
to grasp it and their hands closed on
emptiness now he was nearing the
door and now he was at the door and
still he evaded them 

  hold him

  here he is

  a score of hands stretched forth en-
countered - nothing the shadow was
disappearing through the doorway into
the dark street

  stop him there he goes

  a policeman came running up blow-
ing his whistle as he ran get back he
shouted

  that man hes the murderer
there he goes no where where

  blocking the doorway they strained
their eyes trying to locate the vanished
figure

  theres no one left the house said
the officer scornfully youre seein
things

  i know that man i recognized him
shouted one of the tenants hes don-
ald wentworth the fellow who married
lem wests daughter last night abner
wells gave evidence against old lem
that fellow pretended to be off on his
honeymoon-and he came back to kill

in the holy of holies a small circular
room in the dome of the great babist
temple sudh hafiz kneeled he was
again in communion with his master in
the monastery in remote persia
the phantom hand



  with bowed head he listened to the
inaudible blessing pronounced by the
great seer one of that long line of proph-
ets of all nations that has never become
extinct always there is one of the great
brotherhood on earth to continue the
teaching that all humanity is one

  thou has done well my son came
the words now there remaineth for
thee only the bitterness of death to face
and that shall taste sweeter than honey on
thy lips for it is the death of martyrdom
in which the outer senses are sealed and
the inner ones are opened have no more
fears

   in a little while the call shall come
meanwhile abide in thine house in peace
and serenity thy work is ended and
there is naught more for thee to do

  calmly sudh hafiz rose to his feet and
left the temple he went into the house
adjoining momentarily he expected the
police to arrive and arrest him for the
murder of abner wells

  this seemed a foregone conclusion
sudh hafiz did not realize that moore in
separating dons astral from his body had
involuntarily left a small modicum of the
physical element attaching to it it was
only just enough to make the astral
double visible to the untrained eye that
was why dons shadow had been seen by
the crowd in the hallway of the apartment
house

  sudh hafiz himself by virtue of his
initiation and the opening of the inner
senses was able to discern the astral coun-
terpart of all living things on this
account it did not occur to him that dons
shadow might have been perceptible to
others than himself

  he called the persian boy my end is
at hand he told him go quickly to
the rug-dealer on fourth street who has
orders to secrete thee and later to send

thee back to our country we meet no
more this side of the grave

  master the boy flung himself upon
his knees caught sudh hafizs hand and
pressed it to his lips the tears were
streaming down his face let me die
with you master

  sudh hafiz smiled luminously compas-
sionately hast thou not understood
have i not told thee a hundred times
what was to come firdausi he asked
and that it would come swift as a flash of
summer lightning

  aye master but -i love you and i
can not bear to be apart from you

  thou shalt never be apart from me
while life endures my son replied the
other have this for thy consolation
at home the master hath work for thee
as he hath had work for me

  when the weeping boy had gone sudh
hafiz sat waiting he knew that he him-
self since he had been shown up to
wellss apartment just before the death-
scream should be the person logically
sought for the murder it had happened
however that the desk clerk who had tel-
ephoned up to the apartment when he ar-
rived had immediately after gone off
duty so that no one in the apartment
house was aware that it was he who had
walked up the stairs to see abner wells

   since there were no signs of the advent
of the police sudh hafiz drew out a sheet
of writing-paper and began a letter

meanwhile the news of abners
murder was rapidly circulating
through the city coming so quickly
after the mysterious disappearance of
walstein-for the dead body of the polit-
ical boss had not yet been discovered in
the lonely hut beside the sea-it aroused
intense excitement coupled with a wild
demand for vengeance

  the door of the apartment had been
forced by the police and abner had been


weird tales

discovered lying upon the floor dead in
a pool of blood his skull appeared to
have been crushed in with some heavy im-
plement like a hammer

  the fact that wells had met his death
in precisely the same manner as police
captain morse intensified the popular
anger abner wells had posed as a re-
former and certainly nobody had at-
tempted to unmask him since he was very
useful in that guise to the corrupt political
party with which he was in alliance there
were few who knew the man as he had
been

  it was generally believed therefore
that he had met his death like captain
morse because he was in possession of
certain information that would send some
of the political leaders to the penitentiary
or even to the gallows

  within fifteen minutes an enraged mob
was forming in the streets and orators
were shouting from soap-boxes inciting
them to obtain immediate revenge upon
abners murderers it was a scene that
would have gratified abners sardonic
soul if he could have been there to see
perhaps he was

  when the name of don wentworth be-
gan to be bruited about an immediate
search for him began but here the mob
and the police were baffled don had not
been well known in cannonville prior to
his departure for china he had been away
some time and his return had passed un-
heralded by the press in fact he had
seen no one with the exception of the
superintendent of the apartment house in
which senator west had lived

  the mystification grew greater when
the reverend mr suydam stated that he
had married don and lorna on the pre-
ceding evening he was shrewd enough
not to mention that the marriage had
taken place at sudh hafizs house since
he was fond of the persian and did not

want him brought into the matter in the
present excited state of public opinion
he left the inference that the wedding
had taken place in his own house

  loudly asseverating dons innocence
he stated that by this time he was miles
away from cannonville nobody knew
of dons visit to moores house or
dreamed that he was there at present an
involuntary guest of the black magician

  meanwhile a shrewd newspaper man
who was one of the first to enter abner
wellss apartment had promptly discov-
ered the papers that abner had taken
from his safe a hasty glance at them
while the police were looking at the body
convinced him that they contained
evidence enough to vindicate the name of
lemuel west and to send moore to the
gallows as the real originator of the mur-
der of captain morse

  this was too knotty a problem for him
to solve unaided he took them to his
chief who recognizing their value and
himself afraid to publish them on the in-
stant determined to wait upon develop-
ments

  developments came quickly the desk
clerk who had gone home to bed
aroused by his wife with the information
that the police wanted him dressed and
hurried downstairs his statement that
sudh hafiz had been in abner wellss
apartment at the very time of the murder
threw a fresh light upon the situation
he also recalled that sudh hafiz and don
had visited abner wellss apartment in the
company of the dead man the evening
before

  he added that wellss look had been ex-
tremely agitated as the three entered the
apartment house

  somebody overheard the statement and
communicated it to the crowd within
two minutes an infuriated mob was
the phantom hand



streaming along the road toward the
temple

  but the house next door was lighted
and the amazed mob saw sudh hafiz him-
self seated calmly at his desk a cigarette
between his lips while he wrote a last
letter of farewell to his mother in persia

  sudh hafiz had just finished it when
he heard the yells of the mob sweeping
around the corner of the block he ad-
dressed the envelope hastily sealed it and
placed it in a drawer of the desk that
letter might never reach his mother-but
that was part of the sacrifice sudh hafiz
was content

  the door broke down under the blows
of the mob before he could reach it to
open it he was struck and kicked
knocked all but senseless dragged out
into the street the mob howled for a
rope

  they dragged him unresisting through
the streets toward a little park and
propped him up against an electric light
pole they surrounded him baying like
wild beasts men came running from a
near-by garage trailing a long towing-
rope sudh hafiz barely conscious his
face disfigured from the blows he had
received and streaming blood remained
so calm that those immediately about him
experienced a revulsion of awe but the
bulk of the mob grew even more infuri-
ated

  string him up

  burn him

  make him confess first

  string him up and get it over

  sudh hafiz was stood upon his feet and
a loop of the rope fastened about his neck
the other end being fastened about the
transverse arm of the pole in another mo-
ment he would have been hoisted but at
this juncture a body of policemen ap-
peared on the run shooting their revol-
vers over the heads of the mob which

dispersed in a moment sudh hafiz was
freed of the rope and dragged away to
the lock-up outside which the mob reas-
sembled howling for his blood

  meanwhile the city was being scoured
for don it was believed that he was
in hiding somewhere close by the apart-
ment house wires had been dispatched
to all towns within a radius of three hun-
dred miles and the telephone wires were
humming with inquiries but all the an-
swers were to the same effect neither
don nor lorna had been seen by any one
and it was positive that sudh hafizs car
had not passed through any of those
places as a matter of fact it was at the
moment resting in godfrey moores ga-
rage

  the detectives attempted to elicit in-
formation of dons whereabouts from
sudh hafiz but he was unconscious hav-
ing been stunned by a stone hurled at him
at the moment when he was being rushed
into the lock-up his finger prints were
taken however for comparison with those
that had been discovered on the table in
wellss apartment

in his akashic mirror in the little room
off the light room godfrey moore saw
all that was going on in cannonville and
chuckled he had not planned that sudh
hafiz should be involved in the affair but
if the persian was to be inculpated too it
suited him very well that meant the
destruction of the last of his enemies he
knew that the finger prints left by dons
astral would be in every respect identical
with those left by the living man and
the explosion of psychic force that had
killed abner wells as if by a hammer
blow had imprinted dons finger prints
upon the table as the astral rested its hand
there for a moment

  all that remained now was to turn
don loose so that he might be picked up


weird tales

and loma too she would be taken to
the state asylum and thus the last of
moores difficulties would be disposed of

  the only thing that troubled moore
was that the akashic mirror refused to
show him anything of the future the
moment that the hair-line dividing future
from present was passed it blurred
however this was often the case when
wills were in strong conflict and moore
had no need to know the future since the
present indicated it decisively there
seemed no way in which don could escape
his doom

  he went into the light-room on the
floor of which lay don and lorna each
with the same waxen look of death upon
the features to restore astral to body re-
quired a reversal of the process that had
separated it once more moore flung the
switch that admitted the intensely pen-
etrating rays through the long prism but
this time it was only the healing rays the
ultra-violet violet and indigo that were
admitted to play upon the bodies of the
two

  since a tenuous thread still bound the
astral to the body even though it was
infinitely extensible the astral would re-
spond to the bodily treatment and be
attracted back to its earthly habitation

  to don everything that had passed
since the shock of disembodiment had
been a vague dream no astral counter-
part save that of an initiate is capable of
taking stock of itself and realizing its
whereabouts within the first few days
after it has been withdrawn from the
physical form with which it has been asso-
ciated since birth and before

  don was aware that some fearful shock
had happened to him and that his every
thought had somehow peopled the void
with corresponding phantoms but the
interview with sudh hafiz through the
mediumship of the persian boy had

seemed a dream so too the killing of
abner wells

  don had thought he was in a troubled
nightmare in which moore had been
commanding that he kill abner with a
hammer he had appealed for aid to
sudh hafiz and to his intense astonish-
ment the persian had confirmed moores
order the very thought had carried his
astral unwittingly to wellss apartment
moore had done the rest don had no
idea that wells was dead

  now as the healing rays began to play
upon his body don felt like a man
beginning to awaken and with that
restoration memory began to return to
him first of all memories was that of
lorna gradually she began to take form
in his mind then he recalled his having
discovered her in moores house and the
incidents that followed culminating in
their marriage in sudh hafizs house

  the remembrance that lorna was his
wife quickened the return of double to
body though as a matter of fact the final
act was a matter of less than a second
godfrey moore smiling grimly saw don
stir and open his eyes he shut off the
light and picking him up carried him
into the drawing-room where he laid him
down upon a lounge lorna who had
already come back to consciousness he
had already carried upstairs

  he grinned again as he saw don look
vacantly about him it had all been so
easy don would be so grateful at hav-
ing his wife restored to him that he
would make no trouble and the two
would be arrested before they had gone
more than a few miles from his house in
any direction

  dons eyes lit upon his there was in-
telligence in them now don remembered
moore assumed an air of bland politeness
and anticipated dons first stuttering
words with a speech of his own
the phantom hand



  well wentworth my dear fellow
im glad to see you coming back you
certainly had a narrow escape

  wheres lorna you-you- but

the epithet stopped short upon dons lips
he was not quite sure yet how much was
truth and how much dream he remem-
bered that lorna had disappeared out of
the car on their wedding evening he re-
called that wild drive of his through the
pines to moores house and the taunting
challenge moore had hurled at him he
seemed to remember some experiment of
which moore had made him the victim
but that might have been imagination

  and how did he know that moore had
kidnapped lorna

  moore saw his hesitation and con-
tinued suavely

  your wife is here upstairs my dear
fellow she seems to have had one of
her periodical attacks of mental weak-
ness and slipped out of your car when
you halted by the wayside she came
here hardly knowing what she was do-
ing seeking the place where she had been
cared for as unconsciously and instinctive-
ly as the bird seeks its home

  you followed her on the chance you
supposed i had in some way got her away
from you-a causeless supposition but i
can make full allowance for a man whose
bride of an hour had just left him you
came here-this was last night-and-
well my dear fellow you were tempora-
rily bereft of reason

  i was forced to administer a sedative
in the form of one of the new chloroform
derivatives which produces instant un-
consciousness you have just awakened
that is the long and short of it lorna
has now recovered she is lying down up-
stairs and you are at perfect liberty to
take her away and resume your wedding
journey i must warn you however that
it will be necessary to take the greatest

care of her that the physician has warned
me that these attacks are liable to recur
at any rate for some time to come

  don glared at him he was still weak
but his strength was swiftly coming back
to him he knew the man was lying
but he couldnt quite pin him down to
anything also he knew that in his
dreams he had been at moores mercy
but again he couldnt bring forward such
an allegation as that

  moore knew that he knew and smiled
he was enjoying the situation

  ill see my wifesaid don

  you certainly shall my dear fellow
answered moore he rose if youll
stay where you are and rest comfortably
ill bring her down to you

  don rose weakly i dont trust you
moore he said and i know youve been
lying to me if youve got any tricks in

mind-

  moore elevated his eyebrows in a well-
bred manner rather strong language
my dear fellow he answered how-
ever i can make allowance for your state
of mind and as we are not likely to

meet again-

  bring me my wife said don facing
moore with such a look of cold fury that
moore retreated a step or two in uncer-
tainty

ou shall see her in one minute
wentworth he answered and left
the room but as he reached the entrance
hall don heard another man stamping
across the floor heard him address moore
and moores gasp of surprize and rage

  i got that stuff of yours outside mr
moore he heard the newcomer say in a
strong italian accent

  what stuff are you talking about
cried moore and who the devil are
you

  beg pardon mr moore returned


weird tales

the other im one of mr moronis fel-
lers tony and me we been running
some cases of gin along the coast and
only just landed hes gone on to mr
moronis place near here funny thing
but there was a foreign feller sort of turk
or arab from the look of him waiting
for us when we landed tony and me
thought he was a dick and wed have
bumped him off but there was something
about that guy stopped us shooting
maybe we thought he was a priest-hed
a sort of look like that about him

  he said to us how youd ordered a
case of champagne from mr moroni
what hadnt been delivered and you was
mad about it because you was having a
party and i told him i remembered some-
thing about it and we had a couple of
cases in the boat i told him id bring it
right up to you while tony went on to
mr moronis place and say that feller
vanished like he might have been a ghost
yeah it gave me a scare mr moore

  i got your case outside didnt seem
to weigh nothing when i carried it but
i guess it aint empties for all that ill
bring it in for you

  godfrey moore glared murderously at
the intruder that chance intervention
had ruined all his well-laid plans for don
and the newcomer had already seen each
other this witness to dons presence in
moores house would automatically create
for don a perfect alibi

  just wait outside and ill be with you
in a few minutes he said and turned
and went upstairs don who saw noth-
ing unusual in the interview stood alone
in the hall until moore came down the
stairs again escorting lorna

  she was leaning heavily upon his arm
she looked white as a ghost and utterly
fatigued but at the sight of don a cry of
gladness broke from her lips and she
came running down the stairs toward him

  her arms went round his neck and he
was holding her for the moment obliv-
ious of moores presence

  don dear my dearest forgive me
she wept i dont remember anything
that happened after we started on our
wedding journey and then i awoke just
now and found myself in mr moores
home he told me i-i had an attack of
my old illness and ran away and came to
him oh forgive me dearest don and
dont turn from me

  turn from you lorna im ready to
take you away right on the moment
well just continue our trip

  yes i think thats best said moore
in his bland way youll find your car
in the garage wentworth under ordi-
nary circumstances i should ask you to
wait a little until you were both feeling

better but in view of-

  exactly answered don well bid
you good-bye and drawing lornas
arm through his he walked out of the
house

e got him dead to rights the
detective waved the photographic
film exultantly theyre his finger
prints and there aint no doubt about it
but keep it from the crowd sheriff
thats the ugliest-lookin mob i ever
seen

  the sheriff looked out at the mob that
filled the street yelling for vengeance
upon the prisoner reckon me and my
two deputies cant hold em if they start
ructions he muttered dismally

  thats why im tellin yuh to keep it
dark about them finger prints sheriff
replied the detective

  unfortunately the horse was already out
of the stable in other words the finger-
print experts assistant had already chat-
tered and the news had circulated through
the crowd
the phantom hand



  for ten minutes the yells increased
until they rose into a frightful uproar
then a new movement was discernible in
the crowd it parted and eight men ap-
peared bearing a ponderous beam

  open up sheriff they shouted
through the small barred window were
goin to take him and the quicker you
give him up the better

  the sheriffs answer was inaudible in
the din but his gesture indicated that it
was a refusal next moment the beam
swung ponderously against the heavy
door of the jail

  it cracked and splintered from the
jail window the sheriff and his two dep-
uties covered the beam-bearers with their
revolvers but instantly a score of revol-
vers were covering them they hesitated
and were lost again the beam swung
and again the door broke inward
sagged on its upper hinges and went
down yelling the mob swarmed into
the jail entrance

  the sheriff was quickly overpowered
and his keys were taken from him in a
few moments the cell was unlocked and
sudh hafiz dragged out

  still half unconscious from his blows
his face covered with matted blood he
looked so helpless that the fury of the
mob always keenest against the defense-
less rose to the point of mania it took
all the persuasions of the ringleaders to
prevent them from kicking sudh hafiz
to death then and there

  he was dragged out of the jail and
back through the streets to the little park
the halter was again placed about his
neck a man stepped forward and prod-
ded him viciously in the stomach

  youre going to die dago he
sneered them finger prints in mr
wells apartment was yours and the pho-
tos to prove it if you want to ease your

miserable soul by confessin nows your
time

  a great joy a great peace came into
sudh hafizs eyes and he smiled slightly
to the amazement of the bloodthirsty
throng gathered about him his lips
moved slightly as if in prayer

  master i thank thee he was whis-
pering never in all the world were
two men born with identical finger prints
before i hardly believed when thou
didst tell me

  but the master in the persian monas-
tery was silent for at the supreme crisis
each man must face his destiny alone

  yes said sudh hafiz clearly to the
crowd i killed abner wells which
was probably the whitest lie that was ever
told

  next moment a score of men were
pulling upon the rope but before the
dangling body reached the level of the
horizontal arm it was already inanimate
done to death by a dozen revolver bullets
that had pierced heart and brain and
body

the police had abandoned their efforts
to save sudh hafiz there was
bigger work afoot for the editor of the
newspaper his chief and the police chief
had been closeted together for the past
half-hour going through abner wellss
papers

   chief said the publisher im talk-
ing frankly to you these letters are
going to be published this afternoon and
theyll prove a political sensation of the
first magnitude weve had the goods on
godfrey moore for a long time past
when the public learns of this conspiracy
that sent lemuel west to the gallows an
innocent man its going to send moore to
the gallows and sweep the present mu-
nicipal government out of power in can-
nonville


weird tales

  heres your chance to take the lead
itll mean a high post for you in the next
administration if you dont do it youll
share the odium and probably face crim-
inal charges what are you going to do
no need to threaten me answered
the police chief sourly im appointed
to preserve law and order and run down
guilty parties and what youve shown me
is enough to hang godfrey moore three
times over ill get him

  best get him quick said the pub-
lisher hes a slippery customer

  trust me and now im goin to ask
something of you mr hammond im
takin a force of a dozen cops out to
moores place while the crowds doin
that dervish dance round hafizs body
were goin out by the back road in a
coupla private cars not a word to no-
body never see such a town for leaks
as this one

  ill take you up on that replied the
other but ill ask you to phone in to
me as soon as youve got moore under
arrest benson will write the story and
well have it set up by three of our most
trusted men and well hold the afternoon
edition until i get word from you well
play you up too i guess youll find itll
be the best days work youve ever done 
i aint thinkinof myself answered
the chief of police i always had my
doubts about lem west bein guilty it
looked like a frame-up to me if it hadnt
been captain morse who was bumped
off i might have put up a fight for him
but the force was so ravin mad lem
never had a chance from the beginnin
say aint it queer that persian sudh ha-
fiz was workin in moores intrests
well moore gave a big sum toward
the temple answered the newspaper
publisher and i guess he had sudh
hafiz where he wanted him

  sure sure agreed the chief of police

there aint no doubt he killed wells
finger prints dont lie and that stuff
about seein don wentworth was just the
bunk like i thought but theres some-
thing queer behind it all and mark my
words some day itll come out

  while the lifeless body of sudh hafiz
dangled from the electric light pole and
the mob danced a wild dervish fling
about it two private cars each holding a
half-dozen police officers in plain clothes
rushed out along the back road in the di-
rection of godfrey moores house at
the moment of their departure don was
just beginning to come back to life under
moores ministrations

godfrey moore waited till don and
lorna had disappeared into the ga-
rage which stood some little distance
away from the house then he beckoned
to moronis aide who had been standing
waiting patiently

  bring your stuff inside he com-
manded curtly

  jest a minute boss answered the
italian grinning he disappeared in the
direction of a clump of bushes and
emerged in a minute carrying the case
on his shoulder he brought it into the
house and set it down

   i jest cant make it out boss he said
this here dont weigh no more than a
coupla empty bottles but i guess its the
stuff all right still id like to open it to
make sure mr moroni vould be mad at
me if i delivered you a case of empties
and accidents do happen now and again

  dont worry about what mr moronis
likely to think replied godfrey how-
ever you can open it if you like to make
sure but bring it into the drawing-
room

  the bootlegger had already produced a
chisel and now carrying the case from the
hall into the drawing-room he set it

                     w t-
the phantom hand



down meanwhile moores mind was
working with feverish activity

  he knew that the presence of this man
had nullified his whole cleverly con-
ceived scheme to send don to the gallows
it was not conceivable that don could
have been in cannonville at the time of
wellss murder and have got back to his
own house at the time of the bootleggers
arrival true the psychic finger prints
would practically establish dons presence
in wellss apartment but don had been
there with sudh hafiz the night before
and it might reasonably be contended that
he had left them on that occasion

  well there was only one way out of
the dilemma

  godfrey moore watched the italian
chiselling up the lid of the case it was
open now and he readied in and pulled
out a bottle of champagne

  you see shes full boss he said

  yes stalled godfrey moore he
was waiting for the sound of the engine
starting which would afford him his op-
portunity howd you feel about a
drink he asked the italian amiably

  why say boss i dont never turn
down an offer like that but you aint
got no tumbler here

  never mind knockoff the neck of the
bottle and drink out of it commanded
moore

  the other looked at him in surprize
and then with a shrug of his shoulders
tapped with the chisel around the pro-
truding portion of the neck struck a sharp
blow and the top of the bottle came off
clean a spurt of champagne went over
the floor

  never mind never mind said
moore and at that moment he heard the
sound of dons engine starting

   the italian raised the bottle to his lips
moore standing slightly behind him saw
w t-

him staring into the comer in a puzzled
way whats the matter he asked

  that arab feller there he is whats
he doin in here why dont he speak
gawd hes got a rope round his neck

  petrified with terror the bootlegger re-
mained crouching over the opened case
the bottle in his hand while he stared into
a comer of the room

  godfrey moore whipped out the revol-
ver from his pocket placed it to the bads
of the mans head and fired without a
sound he dropped in an inanimate heap
the bottle falling to the floor and deluging
the rug with wine

  in the garage dons engine was splut-
tering moore quickly replaced the re-
volver in his pocket seized the dead man
by the head and shoulders and dragged
him across the floor and through the two
smaller drawing-rooms and along the
passage into the light-room

  he unlocked the door at the end and
entered the short tunnel in this there
was a cunningly devised trap which
opened upon a vault below the vault
was a natural one and extensive it had
been the scene of many an unhallowed
orgy in the days of the obeah worship
and later when godfrey moore had pur-
sued his investigations into black magic
there

  things had happened there which eyen
moore hardened though he was did not
like to remember and of these the sac-
rifice of helpless human beings lured into
the depths of the pine forests had not
been the most horrible that vault knew
the black mass with all its abominations
it was a center of devil-worship and too
a receptacle for the bodies of the slain

  the trap consisted of a natural phe-
nomenon which had perhaps at first led
to the use of the place for such obscene
purposes it was nothing less than a
rocking-stone that had fallen from the


weird tales

roof above a boulder several tons in
weight yet poised so lightly over the trap
that it could be moved back on its base
with one hand while a team of horses
could hardly have dragged it out of posi-
tion in place it completely concealed
the vault underneath

  holding the dead man by the hair
moore pushed back the stone and dropped
his inanimate burden into the depths be-
low he waited till he heard the faint
thud of the body striking the rock floor
then replaced the stone and went back

  from the other end of the tunnel a pair
of beady eyes watched him and the slit of
a monkey-mouth was curved in infinite
derision it was the hideous negress
mumbling as she crouched like a great
ape among the rocks

  moore went back in the light-room
he inspected himself carefully there
was no speck of blood upon his clothes-
he had been careful of that but in the
drawing-room the rug was blood-stained
and he rolled it up and thrust it beneath
the sofa in a few minutes he would go
back to the vault and fling the rug after
the dead man but just now he heard
dons car backing out of the garage and
going to a side window he saw don at
the wheel straightening the machine
upon the concrete road while his right
arm was about lorna whose head rested
upon his shoulder

  a bitter smile curled moores lips
theyll get him before hes gone a mile
whichever way he goes he muttered
the sight of the love-making caused him
to search his soul was it worth it all
that he had acquired at the cost of the
ordinary human emotions at the cost of a
loved companion along the road of life

  yes it was worth it he decided even
as the master had told sudh hafiz there
was no progress except by sacrifice

whether that progress was upward or
downward

  gleefully he watched the car start along
the road and disappear among the pines
he had don where he wanted him now
his travails and tribulations were at an
end moroni walstein abner wells
were dead and with dons execution all
evidence against him would be obliterated

the sound of shots yells among the
pines startled moore for a moment
then with a grim smile he left the
house and hurried along the road it was
awkward that the search-party should
have come upon don so close to his house
but he would resolutely deny that don
had been his guest even if lorna
backed don up in such a statement there
would be the damning finger prints

  what easier than to say that don must
have been hiding with lorna in the
swamps after making a hurried getaway
from the scene of the murder

  the shots were not repeated but the
yells sounded louder as moore ran from
the house rounding the curve of the
road he saw two cars drawn across the
concrete close beside dons and a number
of men in civilian clothes swarming
about it

  not policemen just a posse of ama-
teurs thought moore it was all easy
easy if he kept his head

  and he moved at a fast but not undig-
nified gait in the direction of the hold-up

  the shots had been fired over the ap-
proaching car as a signal to halt when
don slowed down the police officers
rushed forward gesturing to him to
throw up his hands

  youre wentworth demanded the
chief of police say where you been
since you left cannonville night before
last

  don told him that he had started with
lorna on their wedding-tnp that lorna
the phantom hand



had been mentally afflicted and had wan-
dered away to godfrey moores house
that he had followed her there and had
been drugged or anesthetized by moore
that he had recovered consciousness only
a half-hour before and that moore had
sent him and lorna away

  i dont know what game that mans
been playing but i think hell stand
watching he added

  more than watching said the chief
of police dyou know abner wells is
dead

  dons exclamation of genuine sur-
prize was convincing enough under the
circumstances

  yeah murdered by that persian fel-
ler hes just been lynched

  don cried out in horror sudh ha-
fiz he shouted why hes a saint
oh yeah well well find out why
he did it later maybe anyway he left
his finger prints behind him and he was
in wellss apartment at the time of wellss
death to be frank you was under sus-
picion mr wentworth some feller
thought he saw you but sudh hafiz
confessed and that lets you out all right

besides we happen to know-

  he broke off godfrey moore was ap-
proaching rapidly the police chief
nodded to his men and spoke a few words
quickly don paralyzed with horror at
the news of the persians fate watched
moore approaching

  moore broke into a run youve got
him he cried pointing to don thats
your man he must have been hiding
out in the swamps i saw him driving by
with that girl just now then i heard the
shots and hurried up to you

  oh yeah sneered the police chief
well it happens youre the man were
after moore throw up your hands we
got the goods on you

  in a moment godfrey moore was in

the hands of the police and his revolver
taken from him protests of bland aston-
ishment poured from his lips unheeded

  we takin him bade to town chief
asked the officers principal deputy

  take him back to his house first
answered the police chief maybe well
find some evidence there though weve
got enough to hang him

  youll pay for this snarled moore
through livid lips this is going to cost
you your job you fool and then im

going to sue you for false arrest and-

  youre wastin breath moore an-
swered the other we got the goods on
you abner wells left enough papers
to hang you for framin lemuel west
moore relapsed into silence he
couldnt understand

  bring him inside two of you com-
manded the chief the rest of you
spread through the house and see if
theres anything worth reportin

  he beckoned to two of the policemen
who escorting moore between them fol-
lowed the chief and at that moment
moore made his last desperate bid for
freedom outside the drawing-room he
dived suddenly and rushed through the
blue velvet portieres one of the detec-
tives following him slipped on a rug and
went down his companion falling over
him

  police chief morton drew his gun
swiftly and fired but the bullet went
wide and now moore was in the last of
the drawing-rooms and now he was in
the corridor and racing for the door of the
light-room and tugging at the key of the
farther door as he ran another bullet
slammed into the light-room door beside
his head as he ran but he gained the
room and slammed the door behind him

  no time to stop to lock that one the
door leading into the tunnel was before
him he darted through and inserted the


weird tales

key into the lock on the other side he
fumbled desperately hearing morton
hard upon his heels but then morton
struck the long prism and fell in a cataract
of broken glass and moore was in the
tunnel

  a touch of his hand displaced the rock-
ing-stone beneath it was a steep ramp
upon which moore dropped he clung
to it half-way between the stone above
and the vault beneath hearing the frantic
efforts of the police to break down the
door

  if went down with a crash at last and
he heard their voices in the tunnel he
heard their shouts of surprize as they dis-
covered the opening on the other side the
pine forests and the group of negro huts

  he heard them coming back a long
time later

  yeah hes got away boys he heard
morton say but well comb them woods
for him he cant go far

  much later he crawled to the top of
the ramp and tried the stone but it was
impossible to get sufficient purchase on it
from below and he resigned himself to
awaiting the black womans coming all
this had been foreseen and discussed be-
tween them at a long antecedent date

  and later still when moore had lost
all count of time he heard her whispered
chuckle overhead

  dat you massa

  its me mam are the cops gone

  deyre gone massa

  move back the stone commanded
moore

  massa not understand dat stone
obeah stone obeah put the mark of
death on massa comes now now
massa a fiendish chuckle came from
the creature overhead mamaloi ma-
maloi death comes now death she
shrieked

  mam you black devil if you dont

roll back this stone- shrieked god-
frey moore

  those were the last words ever heard
from his lips what was the secret of the
rocking-stone or how many times its vic-
tims had been trapped in just that way
only the black crone knew slowly it
moved forward gathered impetus
dropped and was wedged firmly into the
orifice a twelve-ton mass that none would
stir until the judgment day

t dont believe it dearest sudh ha-
fiz never killed abner wells even
though he is said to have confessed even
though his finger prints were on that
table ill never believe it

  don sat with lorna on a sunny beach a
month after the tragedy events had
quieted down in cannonville but they
were never going back they had already
come to that decision lorna was conva-
lescent now and all the happenings of
two months before had become dream-
like even to don

  lemuel wests name had been cleared
walsteins body discovered in the cabin
and only godfrey moores disappearance
still puzzled the police and public most
of the latter believing that he had man-
aged to buy off justice and spirit himself
away

  but for sudh hafiz your fathers in-
nocence would never have been estab-
lished said don i believe that in
some way he gave his life for me

  and as he spoke he seemed to see
faintly outlined against the sand a shad-
owy form with hand outstretched in
benediction imagination of course but
for the moment don had a clear con-
sciousness of sudh hafizs presence

  its getting cool lorna wed bet-
ter go back to the hotel said don

  and arm in arm they walked back over
the smooth sand absorbed in each other
 the end 
upernumerary corpse

by clark ashton smith

jasper trilt was dead-but what was that thing in his likeness that lay
supine on the floor of the laboratory

it is not remorse that maddens me
that drives me to the penning of this
more than indiscreet narrative in
the hope of finding a temporary distrac-
tion i have felt no remorse for a crime
to which justice itself impelled me it
is the damnable mystery beyond all
human reason or solution upon which i
have stumbled in the doing of this sim-
ple deed in the mere execution of the
justice whereof i speak-it is this that
has brought me near to insanity

  my motives in the killing of jasper
trilt though imperative were far from
extraordinary he had wronged me
enough in the course of a twelve years
acquaintance to warrant his death twice
over he had robbed me of the pain-
fully garnered fruits of a lifetime of labor
and research had stolen with lying
promises the chemical formulas that
would have made me a wealthy man
foolishly i had trusted him believing
that he would share with me the profits
of my precious knowledge-from which
he was to acquire riches and renown
poor and unknown i could do nothing
for my own redress

  often i marvel at the long forbearance
which i displayed toward trilt some-
thing was it the thought of ultimate re-
venge  led me to ignore his betrayals to
dissemble my knowledge of his baseness
i continued to use the laboratory which
he had equipped for me i went on ac-
cepting the miserable pittance which he
paid me for my toil i made new dis-

coveries-and i allowed him to cheat me
of their usufruct

  moreover there was norma gresham
whom i had always loved in my halting
inarticulate fashion and who had seemed
to like me well enough before trilt be-
gan to pay her his dashing and gallant
addresses she had speedily forgotten the
timid poverty-stricken chemist and had
married trilt this too i pretended to
ignore but i could not forget  as
you see my grievances were such as have
actuated many others in the seeking of
vengeance they were in no sense un-
usual and like everything else about the
affair they served by their very common-
placeness to throw into monstrous relief
the abnormal and inexplicable outcome

i can not remember when it was that
i first conceived the idea of killing my
betrayer it has been so long an integral
part of my mental equipment that i seem
to have nurtured it from all pre-eternity
but the full maturing the perfection of
my murderous plans is a thing of quite
recent date

  for years apart from my usual work
i had been experimenting with poisons
i delved in the remote arcana and by-ways
of toxicology i learned all that chemistry
could tell me on the subject-and more
this branch of my research was wholly
unknown to trilt and i did not intend
that he should profit by anything that i
had discovered or devised in the course

                                     


weird tales

of my investigations in fact my aims
were quite different in regard to him

  from the beginning i had in mind
certain peculiar requisites which no
poison familiar to science could fulfil it
was after endless groping and many fail-
ures that i succeeded in formulating a
compound cf rare toxic agents which
would have the desired effect on the
human system

  it was necessary for my own security
that the poison should leave no trace
and should imitate closely the effects of
some well-known malady thus preclud-
ing even the chance of medical suspicion
also the victim must not die too quickly
and mercifully i devised a compound
which if taken internally would be com-
pletely absorbed by the nervous system
within an hour and would thereafter be
indetectable through analysis it would
cause an immediate paralysis and would
present all the outward effects of a sudden
and lethal stroke of apoplexy however
the afflicted person-though seemingly in-
sensible-would retain consciousness and
would not die till the final absorption of
the poison though utterly powerless to
speak or move he would still be able to
hear and see to understand-and suffer

  even after i had perfected this agent
and had satisfied myself of its efficacy
i delayed the crowning trial it was not
through fear or compunction that i
waited rather it was because i desired
to prolong the delicious joys of anticipa-
tion the feeling of power it gave me to
know that i could sentence my betrayer
to his doom and could execute the sen-
tence at will

  it was after many months-it was less
than a fortnight ago-that i decided to
withhold my vengeance no longer i
planned it all very carefully with com-
plete forethought and i left no loop-
hole for mischance or accident there

would be nothing not even the most
tenuous thread that could ever lead any
one to suspect me

  to arouse the cupidity of trilt and
insure his profound interest i went to
him and hinted that i was on the brink
of a great discovery i did not specify its
nature saying that i should reveal it all
at the proper time when success had been
achieved i did not invite him to visit
the laboratory cunningly by oblique
hints i stimulated his curiosity and i
knew that he would come perhaps my
caution was excessive but it must not
even seem that i had prearranged the
visit that would terminate in his seizure
and death i could perhaps have found
opportunity to administer the poison in
his own home where i was still a fairly
frequent caller but i wished him to die
in my presence and in the laboratory that
had been the scene of my long defrauded
toils

  i knew by a sort of prescience the
very evening when he would come greedy
to unearth my new secret i prepared the
draft that contained the poison-a chem-
ists glass of water colored with a little
grenadine-and set it aside in readiness
among my tubes and bottles then i
waited

  the laboratory-an old and shabby
mansion converted by trilt to this pur-
pose--lay in a well-wooded outskirt of
the town at no great distance from my
employers luxurious home trilt was a
gourmand and i knew that he would
not arrive till well after the dinner hour
therefore i looked for him about nine
oclock he must indeed have been eager
to filch my supposed new formula for
half an hour before the expected time i
heard his heavy insolent knock on the
door of the rear room in which i was
waiting amid my chemical apparatus

  he came in gross and odious with the
the supernumerary corpse



purple overfeeding upon his puffy jowls
he wore an azure blue tie and a suit of
pepper-and-salt-a close-fitting suit that
merely emphasized the repulsive bulki-
ness of his figure

  well margrave what is it now he
asked have you finished the experi-
ments you were hinting about so myste-
riously i hope youve really done some-
thing to earn your pay this time

  i have made a tremendous discovery
i told him-nothing less than the elixir
of the alchemists-the draft of eternal
life and energy

  he was palpably startled and gave me
a sharp incredulous stare

  you are lying he said-or fooling
yourself every one knows and has known
since the dark ages that the thing is a
scientific impossibility

  others may lie i said sardonically
but it remains to be seen whether or not
i have lied that graduated glass which
you see on the table is filled with the
elixir

  he stared at the vessel which i had
indicated

   it looks like grenadine he remarked
with a certain perspicacity

  there is a superficial likeness-the
color is the same    but the stuff means
immortality for any one who dares to
drink it-also it means inexhaustible ca-
pacity for pleasure a freedom from all
satiety or weariness it is everlasting life
and joy

  he listened greedily have you tried
it yourself

  yes i have experimented with it i
countered

  he gave me a somewhat contemptuous
and doubtful glance well you do look
rather animated tonight-at least more
so than usual-and not so much like a
mackerel thats gotten soured on life the
stuff hasnt killed you at any rate so i

think ill try it myself it ought to be a
pretty good commercial proposition if it
only does a tenth of what you say it will
well call it trilts elixir

  yes said i slowly echoing him
trilts elixir

  he reached for the glass and raised it
to his lips

you guarantee the result he asked
the result will be all that one could
desire i promised looking him full in
the eyes and smiling with an irony which
he could not perceive

  he drained the glass at a gulp in-
stantly as i had calculated the poison
took effect he staggered as if he had
received a sudden crushing blow the
empty vessel fell from his fingers with a
crash his heavy legs collapsed beneath
him he fell on the laboratory floor be-
tween the laden benches and tables and
lay without stirring again his face was
flushed and congested his breathing ster-
torous as in the malady whose effects i
had chosen to simulate his eyes were
open-horribly open and glaring but
there was not even the least flicker of
their lids

coolly but with a wild exultation in
my heart i gathered up the frag-
ments of the broken glass and dropped
them into the small heating-stove that
stood at the rooms end then returning
to the fallen and helpless man i allowed
myself the luxury of gloating over the
dark unutterable terror which i read in
his paralytic gaze knowing that he could
still hear and comprehend i told him
what i had done and listed the unforgot-
ten wrongs which he thought i had ac-
cepted so supinely

  then as an added torture i empha-
sized the indetectable nature of the poison
and  taunted him for his own own folly
in drinking the supposed elixir all too
quickly did the hour pass-die hour which


weird tales

i had aubwed for the full absorption of
the poison and the victims death the
breathing of trilt grew slower and faint-
er his pulse faltered and became inaudi-
ble and at last he lay dead but the terror
still appeared to dwell dark and stag-
nant and nameless in his ever-open eyes

  now as was part of my carefully laid
plan i went to the laboratory telephone
i intended to make two calls-one to
tell norma trilts wife of his sudden
and fatal seizure while visiting me-and
the other to summon a doctor

  for some indefinable reason i called
norma first-and the outcome of our con-
versation was so bewildering so utterly
staggering that i did not put in the sec-
ond call

  nortna answered the telephone her-
self as i had expected before i could
frame the few short words that would
inform her of trilts death she cried out
m a shaken tremulous voice

  t was just going to call you felton
jasper died a few minutes ago from an
apoplectic stroke its all so terrible and
i am stunned by the shock he came into
the house about an hour ago and dropped
at my feet without saying a word  i
thought he had gone to see you-but he
could hardly have done that and gotten
bade so quickly come at once felton
the dumfoundment which i felt was
inexpressible i think i must have stam-
mered a little as i answered her

  are you sure - quite sure that its
jasper

  of course its incredible but he is
lying here on the library sofa-dead i
called a doctor when he was stricken and
the doctor is still here but there is noth-
ing more to be done

  it was impossible then for me to tell
her as i had intended-that trilt had
gome to the laboratory-that his dead
body was lying near me in the rear room

at that moment indeed i doubted my
own senses doubted my very brain as i
hung up ihe telephone either i or
norma was the victim of some strange
and unaccountable delusion

   half expecting that the gross cadaver
would have vanished like an apparition
i turned from the telephone-and saw it
supine and heavy with stiffening limbs
and features i went over i stooped
above it and dug my fingers roughly into
the flabby flesh to make sure that it was
real-that trilts visit and the adminis-
tering of the poison had not been a mere
hallucination it was trilt himself who
lay before me no one could mistake the
obese body the sybaritic face and lips
even with the chill of death descending
upon them the corpse i had touched
was all too solid and substantial

  it must be norma then who was de-
mented or dreaming or who had made
some incredible mistake i should go to
the house at once and learn the true ex-
planation there would be time enough
afterward to do my own explaining

  there was no likelihood that any one
would enter the laboratory in my absence
indeed there were few visitors at any
time with one backward look at the
body to assure myself anew of its mate-
riality i went out into the moonless eve-
ning and started toward my employers
residence

i have no dear recollection of the short
walk among shadowy trees and bushes
and along the poorly litten streets with
their scattered houses my thoughts as
well as the external world were a night-
bound maze of baffling unreality and
dubiety

  into this maze i was plunged to an
irremeable depth on my arrival norma
pale and stunned rather than grief-strick-
en for i think she had long ceased to
love trilt was at the door to meet me
the supernumerary corpse



   i cant get over the suddenness of it
she said at once he seemed all right
at dinnertime and ate heartily as usual
afterward he went out saying that he
would walk as far as the laboratory and
look in on you

  he must have felt ill and started
back after he had gone half-way i didnt
even hear him come in i cant under-
stand how he entered the house so quietly
i was sitting in the library reading when
i happened to look up just in time to see
him cross the room and fall senseless at
my feet he never spoke or moved after
that

  i could say nothing as she led me to
the library i do not know what i had ex-
pected to find but certainly no sane man
no modern scientist and chemist could
have dreamed of what i saw-the body
of jasper trilt reposing still and stiff
and cadaverous on the sofa the same
corpse to all outward seeming which i
had left behind me in the laboratory

  the doctor trilts family physician
whom norma had summoned was about
to leave he greeted me with a slight
nod and a cursory incurious glance

  theres nothing whatever to be done
he said-its all over

  but-it doesnt seem possible i
stammered is it really jasper trilt-
isnt there some mistake

  the doctor did not seem to hear my
question with reeling senses doubting
my own existence i went over to the
sofa and examined the body touching it
several times to make sure-if assurance
were possible-of its substantiality the
puffy purplish features the open glaring
eyes with their glacial terror the suit of
pepper-and-salt the azure blue tie-all
were identical with those i had seen and
touched a few minutes previous in an-
other place i could no longer doubt the
materiality of the second corpse-i could

not deny that the thing before me to all
intents and purposes was jasper trilt
but in the very confirmation of its incredi-
ble identity there lay the inception of a
doubt that was infinitely hideous   

a week has gone by since then-a
week of unslumbering nightmare
of all-prevailing ineluctable horror

  going back to the laboratory i found
the corpse of jasper trilt on the floor
where he had fallen feverishly i ap-
plied to it all possible tests it was solid
clammy gross material like the other
i dragged it into a dusty little-used store-
room among cobwebby cartons and boxes
and bottles and covered it with sacking

  for reasons that must be more than
obvious i dared not tell any one of its
existence no one save myself has ever
seen it no one-not even norma-sus-
pects the unimaginable truth   

   later i attended the funeral of trilt
i saw him in his coffin and as one of the
pall-bearers i helped to carry the coffin
and lower it into the grave i can swear
that it was tenanted by an actual body
and on the faces of the morticians and
my fellow pall-bearers there was no
shadow of doubt or misgiving as to the
identity and reality of the corpse but
afterward returning home i lifted the
sacking in the store-room and found that
the thing beneath-cadaver or ka dop-
pelganger or phantom whatever it was-
had not disappeared or undergone the
least change

  madness took me then for awhile and
i knew not what i did recovering my
senses in a measure i poured gallon after
gallon of corrosive acids into a great tub
and in the tub i placed the thing that had
been jasper trilt or which bore the sem-
blance of trilt but neither the clothing
nor the body was affected in any degree
by the mordant add and since then the


weird tales

thing has shown no sign of normal decay
but remains eternally and inexplicably the
same some night before long i shall
bury it in the woods behind the labora-
tory and the earth will receive trilt for
the second time after that my crime
will be doubly indetectable-if i have
really committed a crime and have not
dreamed it all or become the victim of
some hallucinative brain-disease

  i have no explanation for what has
happened nor do i believe that any such
can be afforded by the laws of a sane
universe but-is there any proof that

the universe itself is sane or subject to
rational laws

  perhaps there are inconceivable luna-
cies in chemistry itself and drugs whose
action is a breach of all physical logic
the poison i administered to trilt was
an unknown quantity apart from its dead-
liness and i can not be wholly sure of
its properties of its possible effect on the
atoms of the human body-and the atoms
of the soul indeed i can be sure of
nothing except that i too like the laws
of matter must go altogether mad in a
little while

his side of the curtain

   by renier wyers

     stepping into traffic-crowded fifth avenue tom atwell suddenly
     found himself swept into a strange place and
     a weird adventure

tom atwell came through the
revolving door stepped a few
paces across the polished floor
and then stood stock-still he looked
about him for helene she was not
here a timidity engendered by bewilder-
ment held him motionless he could not
fathom why he had come how absurd
to look for helene he had just taken
her to her home dazedly he frowned
at his wrist-watch it was ten minutes
after midnight-that meant nothing of-
fered no clue

  the place in which he stood was ap-
parently a vast magnificent lobby or foyer
of some grand hotel or club try as he
might he could not recall having seen it
before nor had he ever before suffered
streaks of absent-mindedness such as

must be afflicting him now to cause him
to wander into a strange place without
knowing why or whence he came throngs
of people were swarming through the
door by which he had made his impetuous
entrance once inside they moved off in
all directions singly and in groups he
could recognize none of them

  many of these people to all appear-
ances were as puzzled as he was some
had faces limned with pain and horror
others beamed as though fortified by a
mystic faith or secret knowledge a man
jostled him smiled apologetically show-
ing white teeth in a broad brown polyne-
sian face and walked away

  tom stared was there a costume ball
being staged here or was this chap wear-
ing naught save a flower in his hair and
this side of the curtain



a gay cloth about his loins a real mar-
quesan as suddenly as the contact had
been made it was broken the brown-
skinned man disappeared in the milling
crowd    and what a peculiar-appearing
crowd it was these people were all odd
why there was a hawk-nosed bearded
man clad in a night-shirt a woman with
terrified staring eyes stumbled and fell
as she tried vainly to free herself from
a madhouse strait jacket then she too
was hidden from toms view as what
appeared to be an entire company of
sepoy soldiers trooped across the foyer
 with scarlet sensual lips parted in a
malignant sneer an evilly beautiful wan-
ton in serpent-green decollete drew aside
her skirts as she passed by an emaciated
clergyman who having taken off his hat
and dropped it on the floor was kneeling
beside it his hands clasped in silent
prayer

  as a twentieth century young-man-
about-town who had been to places and
seen things tom had to admit that these
people and this place were to say the
least rather bizarre yet being a young
modern-one of the generation that is
buoyantly journeying through these topsy-
turvy days without faith or fear and
laughing so that it will not weep-he
drew himself up straightened his shoul-
ders plunged his clenched fists deep into
the pockets of his dinner jacket and
asked of no one in particular-

  well whats the racket

  for a moment his well-shaped head
was lifted in a bold defiance of every-
thing and anything that might happen
next but only for a moment after which
little beads of cold sweat stood out on
his brow this whole affair didnt make
sense things were going pretty far
wrong when he-tom atwell usually
unexcitable-talked to himself he wished
for helene at his side with her he

might be able to penetrate the thicken-
ing mystery of this place

  his will wavering he allowed himself
to be swept slowly along with one of the
shifting groups he shuffled aimlessly
forward until blocked by something press-
ing against his chest it was-of all
things-a bar a high wooden counter
across which refreshment was being
served to all who asked for it his stiff
white dress-shirt bulged over the ma-
hogany and his foot found a rail this
must be the longest bar in the world
disappearing into the smoky distances on
either side of him reflected in the mir-
ror behind the bar he saw himself
strained-faced and pale sandwiched be-
tween a huge raw-boned nordic who but
for his modern seamans garb might have
been a viking and an elderly pot-bellied
little satyr in correctly formal and ex-
pensively tailored evening attire the
rotund little mans bloodshot eyes shifted
in their puffy half-moon paunches under
dull drooping lids to appraise tom

grimly determined not to be routed
by the growing disquiet in his heart
and with all the nonchalance he could
summon tom invited the two strangers
to drink with him

  cheer up he said with outward
calm this is probably an advertising
stunt of some kind-getting us all in
here and not letting us know what its all
about what are you going to have
give me rum the young giant re-
plied staring straight ahead rum
sailors rum yust like i wass drinking
when i fall off de boat nobody see me
go under nobody give a damn now
i see nobody no more

  whats the matter with him tom
asked turning to the elderly man
drowned

  wha- tom started then seeing


weird tales

a bartender leaning attentively toward
them said quickly rum for the sailor
brandy for me and for this gentle-
man-

  champagne chirped the aged roue
why not it doesnt cost anything here
and this may be my last chance to get it
on the eve of execution its customary
to give the condemned anything his appe-
tite desires

  the three drained their glasses which
were instantly refilled ignoring his
tom ventured cautiously i wonder
whether or not i heard aright did you
say that our friend here was drowned
setting down his empty glass a second
time and signaling to the barman to fill
it up again the old man nodded affirma-
tively

  certainly hes drowned trouble
with him is that he isnt quite sure hes
dead now i know that i am i died
as a result of eating and drinking too
much and living in a manner which my
jolly doctors warned me would kill me
he again drained the glass and seizing
the bottle proceeded to do his own pour-
ing

  i expected to die long before this
he said as he put down the empty bottle
and lifted the brimming glass but the
event had to wait until i was in the midst
of a charming tete-a-tete over a lobster
supper with la gitana-

  the spanish dancer asked tom
dancer yes spanish no she was
born in omaha nebraska well there
we were she and i feasting in a cozy
private dining-room of the exclusive
shoreland country club when suddenly
things became blurred and dim before my
eyes something seemed to be suffocat-
ing me it pained me cruelly to breathe
she was surprized to hear the death rat-
tle in my throat but not too shocked to
extract twelve one-hundred-dollar bills

from my wallet before ringing for the
waiter thats what i call quick think-
ing again he drank long and deeply

  tom laughed nervously and without
mirth

  s-a-y snarled the old man in a tone
of shrewd cunning that usually followed
his fourth drink what are you laughing
at you dont seem to be quite sure
either

  about what asked tom his grow-
ing dislike for the old sot causing him to
forget momentarily the plight they were
in

  youre not sure that youre dead-
are you

  you sir said tom with forced re-
straint are either drunk or crazy or
both bowing coldly he walked away
with all the poise he could muster against
the panic in his soul he wanted to ask
some one where and what he was but
feared that he too might be regarded as
an intoxicated fool

  again he glanced at his watch it still
stood at ten minutes after midnight ex-
actly the time he had first found himself
in this palace of confusion he paused
before a uniformed page and asked the
time

  there is no time here sir

  oh isnt there youre like every
one else here trying to confound me with
cryptic remarks ive a mind to punch
your face and report you to the manage-
ment toms anger was heightened by
a creeping fear that perhaps the others
were right and he was wrong that some
dire catastrophe had befallen him and
was robbing him of his reason   

  crowds still came through the door
and milled through the halls at inter-
vals large groups would throng into a
long broad corridor at the far end of
which loomed a tall black curtain that
might have been of richest velvet al-
this side of the curtain



though it did not lift or draw aside the
throngs surged ever toward it those in
the fore disappeared into the blackness
as though they were walking through
the curtain

tom turned back and eyed the page
sharply the youth was apparently
a well-drilled servant accustomed to re-
maining courteous at all times toms
truculent remark seemed to have passed
unheard tom hoped that it had for he
wanted to draw some information from
some one without betraying his own ig-
norance and fear

   where are they going he asked in-
dicating the groups that rushed toward
the curtain

   they answered the page are obey-
ing the summons they are answering the
call to perquisition

  what call i hear nothing

  only those whose names are called
hear when your name is called you too
will hear and will go beyond that cur-
tain

   tom attempted to chortle cynically i
suppose you would tell me-if i were to

ask you-that they are all-all-er-

he could not bring himself to utter the
word

   dead said the page finishing the
sentence yes sir they are all dead

  you too

   yessir

  this was carrying things too far if
the page was also dead why did not he
obey the summons tom demanded to
know

   i will go the youth replied when
my name is called some one else will
take my post here-come through that
door just as i did and stand here answer-
ing questions just as i am doing not
any one however you for instance
could not do it you do not seem to

realize just where we are-if youll par-
don my surmising it

  enough enough cried tom his
air of knowing everything and being im-
pressed by nothing was completely routed
he gripped the others arm panic-strick-
en before i go stark mad tell me-
where and what are we

  we are no longer in the land of the
living reconcile yourself to that we are
in the dimension of the dead awaiting
perquisition an examination upon the re-
sult of which will depend our places in
eternity more than that i do not know
i came and took this post just as i would
have reported for my regular duties back
on earth it seemed the only thing to do
but man how can you be so calm
about it you make this condition seem
quite simple and natural

  it is if you stop to think about it
things and people are not so very differ-
ent here than in the world we left be-
hind us our thoughts our habits our
subconscious precepts of morals are all
carried over this far-that is to say-to
this side of the curtain what is beyond
the curtain i do not know none that
goes there ever comes back

  but on this side of the curtain-he
extended an arm toward the crowds-
people are much the same as when they
were alive they bring their knowledge
their stupidity their vices and their vir-
tues their pleasures and their pains-thus
far that is why you can see here-if
you are so minded to see-a dining-
salon conceit halls theaters chapels and
shrines for the devout of all faiths li-
braries prisons art galleries gaming-
tables chessboards gymnasiums gardens
in fact everything that absorbed the en-
ergies and attention of the living is tem-
porarily brought over but as i have said
only this far you might say for the want
of better description that things here are


weird tales

spirit replicas or re-creations of things
the newly dead are not yet ready to re-
lease from their consciousnesses

  tom protested at that listen i stood
at a bar over there-no over there-well
somewhere near here a real bar and i
had real refreshment

  no doubt the page said smilingly
you found that which you imagined you
needed you do not look to be a man
who would wander into one of the li-
braries or kneel in prayer at one of the
shrines you do not even see them

  but if as you say we can bring part
of our lives over this far why can we not
bring friends relatives why is helene
not here with me

  you can not bring the living into the
dimension of the dead

  what about you persisted tom
half hoping that by talk he could ward off
an impending doom what did you bring
from the land of the living

  my work i was a bellhop in the
aldrich hotel-working on the night
shift and earning my way through col-
umbia university i was to get my degree
next june--but i was shot and killed i
surprized some bandits who had bound
up the night clerk and were drilling the
hotel safe i died on duty-in this uni-
form

the mans simple statement made in
a hopelessly matter-of-fact tone
sapped the last bit of courage from
toms veins then it was true they
were all dead suddenly weak afraid that
he was insane and more afraid that he was
not he sank into an armchair what had
happened to him he tried to catalogue
his actions of the day

  it had been a routine wednesday until
four p m he had left the office at that
early hour to go home and prepare for
his date with helene they had met
at six eaten dinner at bonis restaurant

and afterward attended a performance at
the mercury theater although he could
not recall the name of the play he could
recall escorting helene to her home they
had ridden in a taxicab which he had dis-
missed upon arriving at her door he
remembered bidding her a lingering good-
night in the vestibule of her house and
starting to walk home happier than he
had ever been before she had promised
to marry him

  after that-had he reached home he
could not remember

  terror gripped him as he mentally re-
traced that homeward stroll he recalled
walking along lee street crossing third
avenue fourth avenue fifth avenue-
fifth avenue strange he had no recol-
lection of crossing fifth avenue the
next thing he had done it seemed was
to come into this place through that ever
revolving door

  that door people were still whirling
through it one of them a man wearing
a lounging-robe over pajamas his face
drawn in pain and a newspaper gripped
under his arm was shoved by some one
in the crowd behind him he stumbled
against toms chair and in regaining his
equilibrium waved his arms the news-
paper dropped into toms lap

  he glanced down at it-an early edi-
tion of the evening sentinel dated thurs-
day an item caught his eye for the rea-
son that a name in type has the occult
power of focusing the attention of the
person named upon itself the item was
short a minor bit in the gist of the worlds
news but to tom it was a tremendous
awful cataclysm it read

felled by vampire auto

victim near death

  hope waned for the recovery of thomas l
atwell when he failed to regain consciousness
today twelve hours after being struck by a
hit-and-run automobile he was run down short-
ly after midnight while crossing fifth avenue at
lee street and taken to the mercy hospital-
this side of the curtain



  springing to his feet tom flung the
newspaper from him in a gesture of hor-
ror

  im not dead ill not die he uttered
hoarsely i want to live oh helene
where are you

  he lunged forward and against the in-
coming crowds struggled toward the re-
volving door the page attempted to
detain him

  there is nothing out there sir youll
come back this is the only place there
is for the present

  tom shoved him aside reached the
door and whirled through it without
all was blackness he plunged on run-
ning over and through an inky fog that
enveloped him like a stifling blanket it
hindered the movement of his legs and
arms and choked his breath in the
blackness shapes half solid half ether-
eal wraithy and damp collided with
him they were drifting toward the door
which he could no longer see but which
he felt was perilously close behind him
desperately he struggled onward against
a current of invisible force that was push-
ing him back

i ike a swimmer in a sea of night he
j strained against the current the
muscles of his arms legs and torso ached
from over-exertion sharp pains shot
through his head

  at length after seemingly intermina-
ble hours he was ready to surrender to
oblivion the struggle seemed so futile
faint weary and barely able to move he
was when from somewhere in the dark
came a call

  tom dear tom

  it sounded from afar-helenes voice

 tom-

  helenes voice closer now vainly he
tried to shout in response all he could
utter was a throaty gasp he could
scarcely breathe something smote him
on the head bright searing flashes of
light blinded his eyes he closed them
and moaned in pain   

  oh doctor he heard helene whis-
per excitedly he opened his eyes i saw
them i saw them hes regaining his
senses look hes moving oh hell
live he must live i know that he will
several other voices murmured faintly in
his ears they were real earthly human
voices voices of living people

  with tremendous effort he slowly
forced himself to open his eyes again
his lids seemed weighted with lead peer-
ing through them he grew accustomed to
the light which had so startled him why
it was just an ordinary -watt electric
light globe in the ceiling of a hospital
room

  tom atwell swathed in bandages and
prone turned his eyes from the ceiling
light to look into the anxious blue-green
eyes of helene who was kneeling at his
bedside her worry-stained cheeks broke
into a happy tremulous smile tom
merely glanced at the other people-a
doctor a nurse and an intern-and turned
again to helene looking at her longingly
and lovingly

  cheer up sweetheart ill live he
said it was you helene who saved me
i heard your voice-out there-and just
had to come back

the story thus far

robert walton captain of a
ship seeking a passage through
 the arctic ocean saw a low car-
riage fixed on a sledge and drawn by
dogs pass over the ice-field to the north
in it sat a being which had the shape of
a man but apparently of gigantic stature
the next morning after the ice had
broken he rescued from an ice-field an-
other man greatly emaciated only one
of his dogs remained alive for he had
been marooned for some time the man
was victor frankenstein a young scien-
tist who related to captain walton the
incredible story of his life and how he
came to be on the ice-floe

  frankenstein had lived in geneva with
his father and his adopted sister eliza-
beth to whom he was betrothed his
father sent him to school at ingolstadt
with his chum henry clerval there he
progressed in his studies of natural science
to such a point that he learned to create
life

without taking clerval into his secret

frankenstein created a monster eight feet
tall and human in appearance taking his

	tliis story began in wkkd talks for may

materials from graveyards slaughter-
houses and dissecting-rooms the mon-
ster was so terrible to look upon that
frankenstein fled from it and the mon-
ster escaped

  abandoned by its creator the monster
made its way to the vicinity of franken-
steins home where he murdered frank-
ensteins younger brother william

  frankenstein met the monster in a hut
in the alps and there the monster told
him how he had learned to talk by ob-
serving a peasant family for many months
and how he had changed from a being
with good impulses to a malevolent de-
mon because when he revealed himself
to the eyes of the peasants by entering
their cottage they had been so horrified
by his frightful appearance that they beat
him with sticks and drove him away and
all mens hands were raised against the
hideous monster

  the monster offered to go to the wilds
of south america away from human-
kind if frankenstein would create a
female companion for him and threat-
ened that if frankenstein refused he
would destroy not only frankenstein but
also his family horrified the young

w t-
frankenstein



scientist escaped to england with his
companion henry clerval

  the monster followed and infuriated
by frankensteins refusal to create a com-
panion for him he murdered clerval
and threatened to see frankenstein again
on the latters wedding night franken-
stein was charged with clervals murder
but freed through the intervention of his
father with whom he returned to geneva

chapter 

the voyage came to an end we
landed and proceeded to paris i
soon found that i had overtaxed my
strength and that i must repose before i
could continue my journey my fathers
care and attentions were indefatigable
but he did not know the origin of my suf-
ferings and sought erroneous methods to
remedy the incurable ill he wished me
to seek amusement in society i abhorred
the face of man oh not abhorred they
were my brethren my fellow beings and
i felt attracted even to the most repulsive
among them as to creatures of an angelic
nature and celestial mechanism but i
felt that i had no right to share their in-
tercourse i had unchained an enemy
among them whose joy it was to shed
their blood and to revel in their groans
how they would each and all abhor me
and hunt me from the world did they
know my unhallowed acts and the crimes
which had their source in me

  my father yielded at length to my de-
sire to avoid society and strove by various
arguments to banish my despair some-
times he thought that i felt deeply the
degradation of being obliged to answer a
charge of murder and he endeavored to
prove to me the futility of pride

  alas my father said i how little
do you know me human beings their
feelings and passions would indeed be
w t-

degraded if such a wretch as i felt pride
justine poor unhappy justine was as in-
nocent as i and she suffered the same
charge she died for it and i am the cause
of this-i murdered her william jus-
tine and henry-they all died by my
hands

  my father had often during my impris-
onment heard me make the same asser-
tion when i thus accused myself he some-
times seemed to desire an explanation and
at others he appeared to consider it as the
offspring of delirium and that during
my illness some idea of this kind had pre-
sented itself to my imagination the re-
membrance of which i preserved in my
convalescence i avoided explanation and
maintained a continual silence concerning
the wretch i had created i had a per-
suasion that i should be supposed mad
and this in itself would for ever have
chained my tongue but besides i could
not bring myself to disclose a secret which
would fill my hearer with consternation
and make fear and unnatural horror the
inmates of his breast i checked there-
fore my impatient thirst for sympathy
and was silent when i would have given
the world to have confided the fatal secret
yet still words like those i have recorded
would burst uncontrollably from me i
could offer no explanation of them but
their truth in part relieved the burden of
my mysterious wo

   upon this occasion my father said with
an expression cf unbounded wonder my
dearest victor what infatuation is this
my dear son i entreat you never to make
such an assertion again

  i am not mad i cried energetically
the sun and the heavens who have
viewed my operations can bear witness of
my truth i am the assassin of those most
innocent victims they died by my mach-
inations a thousand times would i have
shed my own blood drop by drop to have


weird tales

saved their lives but i could not my
father indeed i could not sacrifice the
whole human race

  the conclusion of this speech convinced
my father that my ideas were deranged
and he instantly changed the subject of
our conversation and endeavored to alter
the course of my thoughts he wished
as much as possible to obliterate the mem-
ory of the scenes that had taken place in
ireland and never alluded to them or
suffered me to speak of my misfortunes

  as time passed away i became more
calm misery had her dwelling in my
heart but i no longer talked in the same
incoherent manner of my own crimes suf-
ficient for me was the consciousness of
them by the utmost self-violence i
curbed the imperious voice of wretched-
ness which sometimes desired to declare
itself to the whole world and my manners
were calmer and more composed than they
had ever been since my journey to the sea
of ice

a few days before we left paris on our
way to switzerland i received the
following letter from elizabeth

  my dear friend-it gave me the
greatest pleasure to receive a letter from
my uncle dated at paris you are no longer
at a formidable distance and i may hope
to see you in less than a fortnight my
poor cousin how much you must have
suffered i expect to see you looking even
more ill than when you quitted geneva
this winter has been passed most miser-
ably tortured as i have been by anxious
suspense yet i hope to see peace in your
countenance and to find that your heart is
not totally void of comfort and tranquil-
lity

  yet i fear that the same feelings now
exist that made you so miserable a year
ago even perhaps augumented by time i
would not disturb you at this period when

so many misfortunes weigh upon you but
a conversation that i had with my uncle
previous to his departure renders some ex-
planation necessary before we meet

  explanation you may possibly say
what can elizabeth have to explain if
you really say this my questions are an-
swered and all my doubts satisfied but
you are distant from me and it is possible
that you may dread and yet be pleased
with this explanation and in a probabil-
ity of this being the case i dare not any
longer postpone writing what during your
absence i have often wished to express
to you but have never had the courage to
begin

  you well know victor that our union
had been the favorite plan of your parents
ever since our infancy we were told
this when young and taught to look for-
ward to it as an eventrthat would certainly
take place we were affectionate play-
fellows during childhood and i believe
dear and valued friends to one another as
we grew older but as brother and sister
often entertain a lively affection towards
each other without desiring a more inti-
mate union may not such also be our case
tell me dearest victor answer me i
conjure you by our mutual happiness
with simple truth-do you not love
another

  you have travelled you have spent
several years of your life at ingolstadt
and i confess to you my friend that when
i saw you last autumn so unhappy flying
to solitude from the society of every crea-
ture i could not help supposing that you
might regret our connection and believe
yourself bound in honor to fulfil the
wishes of your parents although they op-
posed themselves to your inclinations
but this is false reasoning i confess to
you my friend that i love you and that
in my airy dreams of futurity you have
been my constant friend and companion
frankenstein



but it is your happiness i desire as well
as my own when i declare to you that our
marriage would render me eternally mis-
erable unless it were the dictate of your
own free choice

  even now i weep to think that borne
down as you are by the cruellest misfor-
tunes you may stifle by the word honor
all hope of that love and happiness which
would alone restore you to yourself i
who have so disinterested an affection for
you may increase your miseries tenfold
by being an obstacle to your wishes ah
victor be assured that your cousin and
playmate has too sincere a love for you
not to be made miserable by this supposi-
tion be happy my friend and if you
obey me in this one request remain satis-
fied that nothing on earth will have the
power to interrupt my tranquillity

   do not let this letter disturb you do
not answer tomorrow or the next day or
even until you come if it will give you
pain my uncle will send news of your
health and if i see but one smile on your
lips when we meet occasioned by this or
any other exertion of mine i shall need
no other happiness

             elizabeth lavenza
geneva may th -

  this letter revived in my memory what
i had before forgotten the threat of the
fiend-i will he with you on your wed-
ding night such was my sentence and
on that night would the demon employ
every art to destroy me and tear me from
the glimpse of happiness which prom-
ised partly to console my sufferings on
that night he had determined to consum-
mate his crimes by my death well be it
so a deadly struggle would then assured-
ly take place in which if he were victor-
ious i should be at peace and his power
over me be at an end if he were van-
quished i should be a free man alas
what freedom such as the peasant enjoys

when his family have been massacred be-
fore his eyes his cottage burnt his lands
laid waste and he is turned adrift home-
less penniless and alone but free such
would be my liberty except that in my
elizabeth i possessed a treasure alas bal-
anced by those horrors of remorse and
guilt which would pursue me until death

  sweet and beloved elizabeth i read
and re-read her letters and some softened
feelings stole into my heart and dared to
whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and
joy but the apple was already eaten and
the angels arm bared-to drive me from
all hope yet i would die to make her
happy if the monster executed his threat
death was inevitable yet again i consid-
ered whether my marriage would hasten
my fate my destruction might indeed
arrive a few months sooner but if my
torturer should suspect that i postponed
it influenced by his menaces he would
surely find other and perhaps more dread-
ful means of revenge he had vowed
to be with me on my wedding-night yet
he did not consider that threat as binding
him to peace in the meantime for as if
to show me that he was not yet satiated
with blood he had murdered clerval im-
mediately after the enunciation of his
threats i resolved therefore that if my
immediate union with my cousin would
conduce either to hers or my fathers hap-
piness my adversarys designs against my
life should not retard it a single hour

   in this state of mind i wrote to eliza-
beth my letter was calm and affection-
ate i fear my beloved girl i said
little happiness remains for us on earth
yet all that i may one day enjoy is centered
in you chase away your idle fears to
you alone do i consecrate my life and my
endeavors for contentment i have one
secret elizabeth a dreadful one when re-
vealed to you it will chill your frame with
horror and then far from being sur-

weird tales

prized at my misery you will only won-
der that i survived what i have endured
i will confide this tale of misery and ter-
ror to you the day after our marriage shall
take place for my sweet cousin there
must be perfect confidence between us
but until then i conjure you do not men-
tion or allude to it this i most earnest-
ly entreat and i know you will comply

in about a week after the arrival of
elizabeths letter we returned to ge-
neva the sweet girl welcomed me with
warm affection yet tears were in her eyes
as she beheld my emaciated frame and
feverish cheeks i saw a change in her
also she was thinner and had lost much
of that heavenly vivacity that had before
charmed me but her gentleness and soft
looks of compassion made her a more fit
companion for one blasted and miserable
as i was

  the tranquillity which i now enjoyed
did not endure memory brought mad-
ness with it and when i thought of what
had passed a real insanity possessed me
sometimes i was furious and burnt with
rage sometimes low and despondent i
neither spoke nor looked at any one but
sat motionless bewildered by the multi-
tudes of miseries that overcame me

  soon after my arrival my father spoke
of my immediate marriage with elizabeth
i remained silent

  have you then some other attach-
ment

  none on earth i love elizabeth and
look forward to our union with delight
let the day therefore be fixed and on it i
will consecrate myself in life or death to
the happiness of my cousin

  my dear victor do not speak thus
heavy misfortunes have befallen us but
let us only cling closer to what remains
and transfer our love for those whom we

have lost to those who yet live our cir-
cle will be small but bound close by the
ties of affection and mutual misfortune
and when time shall have softened your
despair new and dear objects of care will
be born to replace those of whom we have
been so cruelly deprived

  such were the lessons of my father
but to me the remembrance of the threat
returned nor can you wonder that omnip-
otent as the fiend had yet been in his
deeds of blood i should almost regard
him as invincible and that when he had
pronounced the words i shall be with
you on your wedding-night i should re-
gard the threatened fate as unavoidable
but death was no evil to me if the loss of
elizabeth were balanced with it and i
therefore with a contented and even
cheerful countenance agreed with my
father that if my cousin would consent
the ceremony should take place in ten
days and thus put as i imagined the seal
to my fate

  great god if for one instant i had
thought what might be the hellish inten-
tion of my fiendish adversary i would
rather have banished myself for ever from
my native country and wandered a
friendless outcast over the earth than
have consented to this miserable marriage
but as if possessed of magic powers the
monster had blinded me to his real inten-
tions and when i thought that i had pre-
pared only my own death i hastened that
of a far dearer victim

  as the period fixed for our marriage
drew nearer whether from cowardice or a
prophetic feeling i felt my heart sink
within me but i concealed my feelings
by an appearance of hilarity that brought
smiles and joy to the countenance of my
father but hardly deceived the ever-
watchfulness and nicer eye of elizabeth
she looked forward to our union with
placid contentment not unmingled with
frankenstein



a little fear which past misfortunes had
impressed that what now appeared cer-
tain and tangible happiness might soon
dissipate into an airy dream and leave no
trace but deep and everlasting regret

preparations were made for the
event congratulatory visits were re-
ceived and all wore a smiling appearance
i shut up as well as i could in my own
heart the anxiety that preyed there and
entered with seeming earnestness into the
plans of my father although they might
only serve as the decorations of my tra-
gedy through my fathers exertions a
part of the inheritance of elizabeth had
been restored to her by the austrian gov-
ernment a small possession on the
shores of como belonged to her it was
agreed that immediately after our union
we should proceed to villa lavenza and
spend our first days of happiness beside
the beautiful lake near which it stood

   in the meantime i took every precau-
tion to defend my person in case the fiend
should openly attack me i carried pistols
and a dagger constantly about me and
was ever on the watch to prevent artifice
and by those means gained a greater de-
gree of tranquillity indeed as the period
approached the threat appeared more as
a delusion not to be regarded as worthy
to disturb my peace while the happiness
i hoped for in my marriage wore a greater
appearance of certainty as the day fixed
for its solemnization drew near and i
heard it continually spoken of as an occur-
rence which no accident could possibly
prevent

  elizabeth seemed happy my tranquil
demeanor contributed greatly to calm her
mind but on the day that was to fulfil
my wishes and my destiny she was melan-
choly and a presentiment of evil pervaded
her and perhaps also she thought of the
dreadful secret which i had promised to

reveal to her on the following day my
father was in the meantime overjoyed
and in the bustle of the preparation only
recognized in the melancholy of his niece
the diffidence of a bride

  after the ceremony was performed a
large party assembled at my fathers but
it was agreed that elizabeth and i should
commence our journey by water sleeping
that night at evian and continuing our
voyage on the following day the day
was fair the wind favorable all smiled on
our nuptial embarkation

  those were the last moments of my life
during which i enjoyed the feeling of
happiness we passed rapidly along the
sun was hot but we were sheltered from
its rays by a kind of canopy while we en-
joyed the beauty of the scene sometimes
on one side of the lake where we saw
mont saleve the pleasant banks of mon-
talegre and at a distance surmounting all
the beautiful mont blanc and the assem-
blage of snowy mountains that in vain en-
deavor to emulate her sometimes coasting
the opposite banks we saw the mighty
jura opposing its dark side to the ambi-
tion that would quit its native country and
an almost insurmountable barrier to the
invader who should wish to enslave it

  i took the hand of elizabeth you
are sorrowful my love ah if you knew
what i have suffered and what i may yet
endure you would endeavor to let me taste
the quiet and freedom from despair that
this one day at least permits me to enjoy

  be happy my dear victor replied
elizabeth there is i hope nothing to
distress you and be assured that if a lively
joy is not painted in my face my heart is
contented something whispers to me not
to depend too much on the prospect that
is opened before us but i will not listen
to such a sinister voice observe how fast
we move along and how the clouds
which sometimes obscure and sometimes


weird tales

rise above the dome of mont blanc ren-
der this scene of beauty still more inter-
esting look also at the innumerable fish
that are swimming in the clear waters
where we can distinguish every pebble
that lies at the bottom what a divine
day how happy and serene all nature ap-
pears

  thus elizabeth endeavored to divert her
thoughts and mine from all reflection
upon melancholy subjects but her tem-
per was fluctuating joy for a few instants
shone in her eyes but it continually gave
place to distraction and revery

  the sun sunk lower in the heavens we
passed the river drance and observed its
path through the chasm of the higher and
the glens of the lower hills the alps
here come closer to the lake and we ap-
proached the amphitheater of mountains
which forms its eastern boundary the
spire of evian shone under the woods
that surrounded it and the range of moun-
tain above mountain by which it was over-
hung

  the wind whicli had hitherto carried
us along with amazing rapidity sunk at
sunset to a light breeze the soft air just
ruffled the water and caused a pleasant
motion among the trees as we approached
the shore from which it wafted the most
delightful scent of flowers and hay the
sun sunk beneath the horizon as we land-
ed and as i touched the shore i felt those
cares and fears revive which soon were to
clasp me and cling to me for ever

chapter 

it was eight oclock when we landed
we walked for a short time on the
shore enjoying the transitory light and
then retired to the inn and contemplated
the lovely scene of waters woods and
mountains obscured in darkness yet still
displaying their blade outlines

  the wind which had fallen in the
south now rose with great violence in the
west the moon had reached her summit
in the heavens and was beginning to de-
scend the clouds swept across it swifter
than the flight of the vulture and dimmed
her rays while the lake reflected the scene
of the busy heavens rendered still busier
by the restless waves that were beginning
to rise suddenly a heavy storm of rain
descended

  i had been calm during the day but
so soon as night obscured the shapes of
objects a thousand fears arose in my
mind i was anxious and watchful while
my right hand grasped a pistol which was
hidden in my bosom every sound terri-
fied me but i resolved that i would sell
my life dearly and not shrink from the
conflict until my own life or that of my
adversary was extinguished

  elizabeth observed my agitation for
some time in timid and fearful silence
but there was something in my glance
which communicated terror to her and
trembling she asked what is it that
agitates you my dear victor what is it
you fear

  oh peace peace my love replied
i this night and all will be safe but this
night is dreadful very dreadful

  i passed an hour in this state of mind
when suddenly i reflected how fearful the
combat would be to my wife and i ear-
nestly entreated her to retire resolving not
to join her until i had obtained some
knowledge as to the situation of my
enemy

  she left me and i continued some time
walking up and down the passages of the
house and inspecting every corner that
might afford a retreat to my adversary
but i discovered no trace of him and
was beginning to conjecture that some for-
tunate chance had intervened to prevent
the execution of his menaces when sud-
frankenstein



denly i heard a shrill and dreadful scream
it came from the room into which eliz-
abeth had retired as i heard it the
whole truth rushed into my mind my
arms dropped the motion of every muscle
and fiber was suspended i could feel the
blood trickling in my veins and tingling
in the extremities of my limbs this
state lasted but for an instant the scream
was repeated and i rushed into the room

  great god why did i not then expire
why am i here to relate the destruction
of the best hope and the purest creature of
earth she was there lifeless and inan-
imate thrown across the bed her head
hanging down and her pale and distorted
features half covered by her hair every-
where i turn i see the same figure-her
bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by
the murderer on its bridal bier could i
behold this and live alas life is obsti-
nate and clings closest where it is most
hated for a moment only did i lose
recollection i fell senseless on the ground

  when i recovered i found myself sur-
rounded by the people of the inn their
countenances expressed a breathless terror
but the horror of others appeared only as
a mockery a shadow of the feelings that
oppressed me i escaped from them to
the room where lay the body of elizabeth
my love my wife so lately living so dear
so worthy she had been moved from the
posture in which i had first beheld her
and now as she lay her head upon her
arm and a handkerchief thrown across
her face and neck i might have supposed
her asleep i rushed towards her and
embraced her with ardor but the deadly
languor and coldness of the limbs told
me that what i now held in my arms had
ceased to be the elizabeth whom i had
loved and cherished the murderous
mark of the fiends grasp was on her neck
and the breath had ceased to issue from
her iips

  while i still hung over her in the
agony of despair i happened to look up
the windows of the room had before
been darkened and i felt a kind of panic
on seeing the pale yellow light of the
moon illuminate the chamber the shut-
ters had been thrown back and with a
sensation of horror not to be described i
saw at the open window a figure the most
hideous and abhorred a grin was on
the face of the monster he seemed to
jeer as with his fiendish finger he pointed
towards the corpse of my wife i rushed
towards the window and drawing a pistol
from my bosom fired but he eluded me
leaped from his station and running with
the swiftness of lightning plunged into
the lake

  the report of the pistol brought a
crowd into the room i pointed to the
spot where he had disappeared and we
followed the track with boats nets were
cast but in vain after passing several
hours we returned hopeless most of my
companions believing it to have been a
form conjured up by my fancy after
having landed they proceeded to search
the country parties going in different di-
rections among the woods and vines

  i attempted to accompany them and
proceeded a short distance from the
house but my head whirled round my
steps were like those of a drunken man
i fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion
a film covered my eyes and my skin was
parched with the heat of fever in this
state i was carried back and placed on a
bed hardly conscious of what had hap-
pened my eyes wandered round the room
as if to seek something that i had lost

  after an interval i arose and as if by
instinct crawled into the room where the
corpse of my beloved lay there were
women weeping around-i hung over it
and joined my sad tears to theirs-all this

weird tales

continued from page 

cameron of toronto canada allow me to congratulate you upon your selection of
stories i believe the latest issue contains better stories than any issue of recent years
my vote for first place goes to g g pendarves for the feature story the altar of
melek taos it was an old idea superbly done a close second is arlton eadie with
the eye of truth i would like to read more of this writers work as he has won-
derful descriptive ability and surely can put a story across

   i have just read bride of the peacock by e hoffmann price writes delight
merriam of oak glen illinois zounds what a story i wonder does the author
wear shoes this tale is the best yet since his stranger from kurdistan lets have
more of this refreshing oriental atmosphere a la price

   writes eduard l klein of cincinnati i am only an occasional reader of
weird tales but when i do purchase a copy it is with the assurance that it contains
one of mr derleths quiet but vivid tales his latest the sheraton mirror particular-
ly pleased me the ominous atmosphere then the literally maddening crash at the
end is i think beyond all your other authors

   although i have been a constant reader of weird tales for seven years and
take great interest in the eyrie says a letter from freda crusius of st louis this
is the first time i have written to that department i am glad to see the majority of
readers are opposed to serial reprints i will not bother to repeat their adequate argu-
ments against them but i do hope that from time to time you will reprint some of
the fine stories that have appeared in back issues of weird tales i want to com-
ment on the particularly fine story the sheraton mirror by august w derleth
which appears in the september issue i have long been an admirer of mr dereleth
elsie meyer of east orange new jersey writes to the eyrie there is only one
fault i have to find with weird tales and that is that it only comes out once a
month so while you are about it see what you can do to publish it more frequently
i have been a constant reader for a good many years and have always found it to
my utmost satisfaction every month as i am such an old friend of weird tales i
feel it my solemn duty to contribute my vote against your publishing serial reprints
but whatever you do please dont give up your reprint department i have some very
fond memories of the burial of the rats by bram stoker and also the phantom
farmhouse both of which were reprinted by your magazine couldnt you please
give us some of bram stokers earlier stories every time i ask for them at a book
store they say sorry out of print i can assure you i would greatly appreciate them
and i do not think i am alone in this request

   i regret only one thing about weird tales writes mrs helen sontag of cin-
cinnati and that is that it is published so infrequently i wish it were a weekly pub-
lication instead of a monthly one a month between the copies seems like a year to
me several days before the new issue is due i haunt my favorite news stand with im-
patient strides hoping the copies will come early i agree with those eyrie writers
who want you to discontinue the serials in your reprint department let us have a
good short story or novelette in place of them i particularly like vampire stories and
also stories of other planets may your delightfully different magazine enjoy con-
tinued success

please turn to page

through the silence which shrouded the corridors of the royal palace stole
twenty furtive figures their stealthy feet bare or cased in soft leather made
no sound the torches which stood in niches along the hall gleamed red on
dagger sword and keen-edged ax

    easy all hissed ascalante stop that cursed loud breathing whoever it is
the officer of the night-guard has removed most of the sentries from these halls and
made the rest drunk but we must be careful just the same back here comes the
guard

    they crowded back behind a cluster of carven pillars and almost immediately ten
giants in black armor swung by at a measured pace their faces showed doubt as
they glanced at the officer who was leading them away from their post of duty this
officer was rather pale and as the guard passed the hiding-places of the conspira-
tors he was seen to wipe the sweat from his brow with a shaky hand he was young
and this betrayal of a king did not come easy to him

    the guardsmen clanked by and disappeared up the corridor

   good grinned ascalante conan sleeps unguarded haste if they catch us
killing him we are undone-but few men will espouse the cause of a dead king

    aye haste cried rinaldo his blue eyes matching the gleam of the sword he
swung above his head my blade is thirsty i hear the gathering of the vultures
on

    they hurried down the corridor with reckless speed and stopped before a gilded
door which bore the royal dragon symbol   

    the amazing the utterly weird and incredible thing that happened to the con-
spirators as they burst in the door to conans bedchamber will be told in the decem-
ber weird tales by a master of eery fiction

   writes hazel portelli of detroit before making comments on the contents of
the september issue i wish to say that the cover is very unusual and beautiful one
which i intend to preserve carefully the altar of melek taos is a wonderful story
the eye of truth is both beautiful and weird and yet possesses the sound of truth that
makes it doubly interesting after reading the ravening monster i shall never
want to own another dog though i have always loved them i do not care for the
story over times threshold as i could not understand it at all keep up the kind
of stories you are now printing and ill keep buying

   e l mengshoel of minneapolis writes to the eyrie the majority of your
readers being against reprints i cheerfully join the minority for as henrik ibsen
says in his play an enemy of the people the majority is always wrong but re-
print something not so generally known then and just now i recall one voice for
the necronomicon well why not it certainly would be interesting to know what
those mysteries are about as they have been referred to quite often in your stories by
lovecrft and others the best story ever written by seabury quinn was in my judg-
ment the dark angel in the august number about that fanatical episcopal minis-
ter who impersonated his satanic majesty in order to visit the supreme wrath on
sinners against his puritanic egotism there is nothing preternatural nor impossible
in that story his plot was very plausible as there are still plenty of superstitious
people and still quite a few potential torquemadas calvins and cotton mathers at
large

   readers what is your favorite story in this issue the most popular story in the
september issue as shown by your votes and letters to the eyrie was clark ashton
smiths bizarre fantasy the empire of the necromancers which was closely pressed
for first place by g g pendarves tale of devil-worship the altar of melek taos

time no distinct idea presented itself to
my mind but my thoughts rambled to
various subjects reflecting confusedly on
my misfortunes and their cause i was
bewildered in a cloud of wonder and
horror the death of william the execu-
tion of justine the murder of clerval
and lastly of my wife even at that mo-
ment i knew not that my only remaining
friends were safe from the malignity of
the fiend my father even now might be
writhing under his grasp and ernest
might be dead at his feet this idea made
me shudder and recalled me to action i
started up and resolved to return to ge-
neva with all possible speed

there were no horses to be procured
and i must return by the lake but the
wind was unfavorable and the rain fell in
torrents however it was hardly morn-
ing and i might reasonably hope to arrive
by night i hired men to row and took
an oar myself for i had always expe-
rienced relief from mental torment in
bodily exercise but the overflowing mis-
ery i now felt and the excess of agitation
that i endured rendered me incapable of
any exertion

   i threw down the oar and leaning my
head upon my hands gave way to every
gloomy idea that arose if i looked up
i saw the scenes which were familiar to
me in my happier time and which i had
contemplated but the day before in the
company of her who was now but a shad-
ow and a recollection tears streamed
from my eyes the rain had ceased for a
moment and i saw the fish play in the
waters as they had done a few hours be-
fore they had then been observed by
elizabeth nothing is so painful to the
human mind as a great and sudden

  more marvelous than the power
of the magicians wand is the
power that can be developed in the
newly discovered cosmic areas of
your own mind

  you can turn your mental pic-
tures into living vibrating waves of
power that will reach other minds
or attract to your consciousness the
creative laws of nature which bring
your wishes and desires into being

change the sun might shine or the
clouds might lower but nothing could
appear to me as it had done the day be-
fore a fiend had snatched from me
every hope of future happiness no crea-
ture had ever been so miserable as i was
so frightful an event is single in the his-
tory of man

  but why should i dwell upon the in-
cidents that followed this last overwhelm-
ing event mine has been a tale of hor-
rors i have reached their acme and what
i must now relate can but be tedious to
you know that one by one my friends
were snatched away i was left desolate
my own strength is exhausted and i must
tell in a few words what remains of my
hideous narration

  i arrived at geneva my father and
ernest yet lived but the former sunk
under the tidings that i bore i see him
now excellent and venerable old man
his eyes wandered in vacancy for they had
lost their charm and their delight - his
elizabeth his more than daughter whom
he doted on with all that affection which
a man feels who in the decline of life
having few affections clings more earnest-
ly to those that remain cursed cursed
be the fiend that brought misery on his
gray hairs and doomed him to waste in
wretchedness he could not live under
the horrors that were accumulated around
him the springs of existence suddenly
gave way he was unable to rise from his
bed and in a few days he died in my
arms

  what then became of me i know
not i lost sensation and chains and dark-
ness were the only objects that pressed
upon me sometimes indeed i dreamt
that i wandered in flowery meadows and
pleasant vales with the friends of my
youth but i awoke and found myself in
a dungeon melancholy followed but by

degrees i gained a clear conception of my
miseries and situation and was then re-
leased from my prison for they had
called me mad and during many months
as i understood a solitary cell had been
my habitation

liberty however had been an useless
 gift to me had i not as i awakened
to reason at the same time awakened to
revenge as the memory of past misfor-
tunes pressed upon me i began to reflect
on their cause-the monster whom i had
created the miserable demon whom i had
sent abroad into the world for my destruc-
tion i was possessed by a maddening
rage when i thought of him and desired
and ardently prayed that i might have him
within my grasp to wreak a great and sig-
nal revenge on his cursed head

  nor did my hate long confine itself to
useless wishes i began to reflect on the
best means of securing him and for this
purpose about a month after my release
i repaired to a criminal judge in the town
and told him that i had an accusation to
make that i knew the destroyer of my
family and that i required him to exert
his whole authority for the apprehension
of the murderer

  the magistrate listened to me with at-
tention and kindness-be assured sir
said he no pains or exertions on my part
shall be spared to discover the villain

  i thank you replied i listen there-
fore to the deposition that i have to
make it is indeed a tale so strange that
i should fear you would not credit it were
there not something in truth which how-
ever wonderful forces conviction the
story is too connnected to be mistaken for
a dream and i have no motive for false-
hood

  my manner as i thus addressed him
was impressive but calm i had formed in
my own heart a resolution to pursue my
weird tales

i

destroyer to death and this purpose
quieted my agony and for an interval
reconciled me to life i now related my
history briefly but with firmness and pre-
cision marking the dates with accuracy
and never deviating into invective or ex-
clamation

   the magistrate appeared at first per-
fectly incredulous but as i continued he
became more attentive and interested i
saw him sometimes shudder with horror
at others a lively surprize unmingled
with disbelief was painted on his coun-
tenance

   when i had concluded my narration i
said this is the bing whom i accuse
and for whose seizure and punishment i
call upon you to exert your whole power
it is your duty as a magistrate and i be-
lieve and hope that your feelings as a man
will not revolt from the execution of those
functions on this occasion

  this address caused a considerable
change in the physiognomy of my own
auditor he had heard my story with that
half kind of belief that is given to a tale
of spirits and supernatural events but
when he was called upon to act officially
in consequence the whole tide of his in-
credulity returned he however an-
swered mildly i would willingly afford
you every aid in your pursuit but the crea-
ture of whom you speak appears to have
powers which would put all my exertions
to defiance who can follow an animal
which can traverse the sea of ice and in-
habit caves and dens where no man would
venture to intrude besides some months
have elapsed since the commission of his
crimes and no one can conjecture to what
place he has wandered or what region
he may now inhabit

   i do not doubt that he hovers near the
spot which i inhabit and if he has indeed
taken refuge in the alps he may be
hunted like the chamois and destroyed as

a beast of prey but i perceive your
thoughts you do not credit my narrative
and do not intend to pursue my enemy
with the punishment which is his desert
as i spoke rage sparkled in my eyes
the magistrate was intimidated-you
are mistaken said he i will exert my-
self and if it is in my power to seize the
monster be assured that he shall suffer
punishment proportionate to his crimes
but i fear from what you have yourself
described to be his properties that this
will prove impracticable and thus while
every proper measure is pursued you
should make up your mind to disappoint-
ment

  that can not be but all that i can say
will be of little avail my revenge is of
no moment to you yet while i allow it
to be a vice i confess that it is the de-
vouring and only passion of my soul my
rage is unspeakable when i reflect that the
murderer whom i have turned loose upon
society still exists you refuse my just
demand i have but one resource and i
devote myself either in my life or death
to his destruction

  i trembled with excess of agitation as
i said this there was a frenzy in my man-
ner and something i doubt not of that
haughty fierceness which the martyrs of
old are said to have possessed but to a
genevan magistrate whose mind was oc-
cupied by far other ideas than those of
devotion and heroism this elevation of
mind had much the appearance of mad-
ness he endeavored to soothe me as a
nurse does a child and reverted to my tale
as the effects of delirium

  man i cried how ignorant art thou
in thy pride of wisdom cease you know
not what it is you say

  i broke from the house angry and dis-
turbed and retired to meditate on some
other mode of action
