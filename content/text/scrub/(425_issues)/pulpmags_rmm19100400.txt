story of the pay envelope

    whether young or old if youre untrained your pay
will tell the same old story - skimping along on a small salary -
living expenses advancing year by year - no hopes of a raise -
why because you lack the training that makes promotion sure

    training makes the difference in men and in salaries the
untrained man of sixty in spite of his years of service can earn

rough-riders of the rail

by gilson willets

the extremes to which some men go-and women too as mr willets
informs us in this article-to get a free ride on a train surpass even
the deeds of daring of the early indian fighters that they take their
lives in their hands that they are driven to hunger desperation and even
insanity in their desire to get from one place to another seems to prove that
the bo-as he is commonly called-does not annex himself to a brake-beam
or hide in a box car just for the fun of the thing

      that mr willets gathered the following stories on one of his journeys
 around the country for the railroad mans magazine attests their
 authenticity whether or not the bo is frequently driven to his vagabond
 life by existing conditions is not for us to decide but that he is a factor in
 human life to be reckoned with we know he doesnt care much to talk
 but when he does he usually has something to say

the railroad mans magazine

  my corduroys hunting-boots poncho
cartridge-belt-in fact all the chief arti-
cles of my kit were missing-even my
tobacco til have to buy a new out-
fit i said after i had signed a claim on
the espee  for im obliged to start out
with bill greene to-morrow for a hunt in
mexico

    dont buy much replied the detec-
tive  because by the time you return ill
have the stolen stuff as well as the stealer
its a hobo job and the rangers mean-
ing the famous texas rangers under
captain mcdonald will get that tramp
within a few days

caught in the sage-brush

  i was gone three weeks  the hunt
reaching el paso once more i was con-
fronted by that same railroad detective

   mcdonalds men got him he greet-
ed me a free-rider yes but not a
professional tramp it was his first of-
fense-tells a plausible story-but now
if youll step around to court youll have
a chance to identify your property

  the court was held in a small room
over a store all my togs were returned
to me even the tobacco well your
texas rangers certainly are the most ca-
pable police ive encountered i said

    it was simple replied the detective
 the man was out in the sage - brush
without food or firearms nothing easier
than to get a fugitive under such condi-
tions hes around the corner-in jail

   i asked if i might see the  amateur 
hobo and the detective accompanied me
to the calaboose and introduced me to the
warden who brought out the prisoner

  he was a sorry-looking customer it
was not merely that his clothes were in
tatters it was his singularly emaciated
appearance his livid paleness his bright
staring eyes his skin seemed drawn
tight over his bones giving peculiar
prominence to his features especially to
his nose

starving to death

    i know i said  ive seen men in
your condition before - thousands of
them during the great famine in india
you have been near death from starva-
tion

    right  he answered in a voice wo-
fully weak  im a victim of circum-
stances im no stew-bum- vag may
i tell you my story from the very begin-
ning

   two months ago he began  i was
employed as an engine hostler by the illi-
nois central railroad at new orleans
i earned ninety dollars a month the
doctors said i showed signs of consump-
tion  determined to get up to new
mexico

   im a saving man i had three
months wages in my pocket yet i re-
solved to beat my way to new mexico
like the tramps ave often captured in the
yards at new orleans that resolution
led to-this and he pointed to the iron-
barred cells

    i told no one of my plan and alone
in the night i crept through the yards to
a box car i had previously selected for
my purpose on a train going west

lured by a trap-door

    i chose this particular car because it
had a small trap-door a sliding affair in
the roof the trap was for the passing
back and forth of lamps i counted upon
that trap-door to help me to get out of
the car in case some one should come
along and lock the side doors

    i slept well the first night the stop-
ping of the train in the morning awoke
me it was stifling hot and i wished to
let in some fresh air by sliding open one
of the side doors

   but try as i would with all my
strength neither of the side doors would
open some one evidently had locked
them during the night but no matter

i had my trap in the roof i would open
that just enough to let in some air-for
i had closed that trap the moment i en-
tered the car in order to minimize the
chances of detection

    imagine my predicament when i tried
to open the trap and found that it
wouldnt budge not till then did i re-
call that such trap-doors in some cars
could be opened only from the outside

    i was hungry and thirsty did i cry
out and bang on the door nix dis-
covery by the wrong person would mean

i supposed arrest i would wait a while
probably at some station men of the right
rough-riders oe the rail



sort who would look the other way while
i walked off might open the door

the heat unendurable

   sleep was then the best way to pass
the time i slept all day till the gnaw-
ing of a famished stomach
awoke me  had been
twenty-four hours without
food or water the train
jolted frightfully my
bones ached i was racked
with pain from head to
foot

   to cry out now would
be useless with the train
pounding along no one
could hear me the heat
became almost unendura-
ble and the sand of the
desert was drifting in fill-
ing my eyes and mouth

 in agony i cried out

i realized how foolish i
was to try this box-car
riding it seemed to me
that my voice sounded ex-
ceedingly far away but i
was not sure on account of
the noise of the train

   after that i must have
fainted then i must have
slept a long time for when
i awoke it was again day-
light though whether
morning or afternoon i
knew not

   still the train thun-
dered and jolted on

would it never stop so i
could summon assistance

the third night passed in
the morning i found my-
self too feeble to rise to my
feet i had been three
nighty and two days with-
out a bite to eat

   the train stopped now  would be
rescued would be able to buy food and
get water i was cold though i knew i
must be in a hot country i had chills-
ague now  suffocated my tongue
was swollen my mouth seemed to be
filled with a hot potato

   but die train was standing still 
tried to call for help but could not utter

a sound the best i could do was to tap
on the floor with my knuckles no one
heard hours passed  guess  became
delirious-then unconscious

   when  came to i lay in a hospital
in san antonio a mere shadow of a man
they told me that the car they found me

alone in the night i crept through the yards
to the box car

in had lain unopened in the yards for two
days and nights that meant that i had
been without food or water for five nights
and four days

   no wonder i was merely skin and
bones no wonder that the sight of food
now nauseated me while the sight of
water drove me mad

   but i recovered of course they


the railroad mans magazine

   not till then did i realize the mad-
ness of my act in again attempting to
beat my way was i again to starve
no i was on a passenger-train in
twenty-four hours i would be in el paso
i resolved to have patience to go hungry
bravely for that time

 by nightfall i found myself suffer-
ing acutely both physically and mental-
ly recollections of my previous expe-
rience rushed through my head i yelled
and raved in despair pood was my only
thought food i must
have

     presently a wild idea
  came to me your trunk
  maybe it contained food
  i seized one of the fish-
  plates smashed the trunk
  open but found no food

    a maniac indeed i
  then became with a crazy
  notion of ending my life
  i butted my head against
  the side of the car

     i knew no more till the
  next morning there was
  the smashed trunk staring
  me in the face there
  were its contents scattered
  over the floor in my wild
  search for food now id
  isurely be arrested not only
  for a vagrant but for a common thief

   in desperation i tried the door im-
agine my astonishment when i tell you
that the door opened

   it had not been locked here was
light air liberty

   quickly i made my plans we were
in the sage-brush at the first stop i
would leave the train and take with me
some of the clothes from the trunk i
would array myself in those garments
bury my own and no one would then
recognize me

   that mad plan i carried out - all
except the donning your clothes and
burying mine i seemed to forget why
i carried those stolen clothes in the
pockets of your hunting - coat i fouild
tobacco and a pipe i smoked the
tobacco gave my stomach something to
work on-till the rangers found me

  you know the rest im glad they
ran me down for i was slowly starv-
ing to death in the brush i hope sir

maybe it contained food

   certainly i must have been still
weak in mind though strong enough in
body to walk for i went deliberately
back to the railroad yards with an insane
determination to hold on to my money
and ride to el paso free

   the sunset express was ready to
pull out next to the engine was the
baggage express - car its doors slightly
open i looked in it was empty save
for a few fish-plates i climbed in un-
observed and sat down in the corner far-
thest from the door

the welcome trunk

   just before the train started some one
pushed the door open about two feet and
shoved in a trunk the train started i
heaved a sigh of relief-for the door was
left open the trunk was yours

   on the outskirts of san antonio the
train pulled up-and a man slammed the
door shut and i heard him lock it

discharged me from the hospital why
i was not arrested for riding in the box-
car i dont know i wish they had ar-
rested me then-it would have been bet-
ter i wouldnt be suffering here
rough-riders of the rail



that i have convinced you that im no
common hobo that is all

   before  left el paso that  free-
rider-the name he gave was jim some-
body-or-other - was sentenced to thirty-
days on the work gang

an army of hoboes

   i  hit  tacoma washington in no-
vember there i learned that a veritable
army of hoboes was passing through the
city on the way to warmer california
-the calaboose so railroad yardmen told
me was filled with a new set of weary
willies each night

    the only room weve got for em is
so full said the keeper at the calaboose
 that  cant even crowd in myself to
use the phone to-morrow morning well
escort the tramps to the northern pacific
freight yards and order em to  hit the
grit  and put tacoma far behind yet
to-morrow night the calaboose will be
full up with hoboes again

    theres one man in there doesnt be-
 long there lie continued its that tall
 chap with the red whiskers hes a lum-
 ber-jack-not a real hobo you know-yet
 he and his kind when theyre  jungling
 live a regular hobo life the railroad
 police happened to round up that chap
 along with the rest	

   i determined to be a part of that escort
 the next morning and get acquainted with
 the tall red-bearded lumber-jack be-
 fore daylight the patrolmen and myself
 escorted some forty  stew-bums  vags
 and general wrecks to the northern pa-
 cific freight-trains and while the un-
 feathered birds of passage scurried for
 means of flight  annexed the lumber-
 jack and led him off to hot coffee and
 ham and eggs

    the simon-pure hoboes detest us he
 said as lie tucked a fried egg in its
 entirety into his mouth  they wont
 have nothing to do with us cause we
 work when were  jungling a lot of
 us get together build a shack in the woods
 and live on the country-club plan

lost in a box car

    ill tell you a story you can verify if
 you want to by writing to the missouri
 pacific vardmastcr at gurdon arkansas

 its a bill of particulars of how  got lost
 once in a mop box car-car and all

    some of us lumbermen travel same
as those who never work youll find us
on freight-trains from the atlantic to the
pacific my homes way back in con-
necticut some years ago at the end
of my season in a northern california
camp as a swamper-which is trimming
branches from trees and clearing a road
through the brush-i wanted to go back
east and see new itaven once more

    i got down to san francisco where
i heard that a fast freight of only five
cars was to go through to new york in
six da vs that was the train for me it
happened to be a very important an un-
usual train-a silk-train worth half a
million dollars each of the five cars
was filled with a hundred thousand dol-
lars worth of silk

    but i didnt get out of california
before the enemy discovered me and gave
me the boot then i worked eastward till
i got into arkansas there i  changed
cars id had enough of trucks i want-
ed a nice comfortable place to stretch
inside of a car and i got it-a car on
a mop train half filled with boxes of
canned salmon say wasnt that salmon
great 

a banquet on salmon

    as soon as they locked me in all snug
 i knocked off the cover of one of the
 boxes used a nail for a can-opener and
 began feasting on columbia river salmon

    n the second day something the very
 queerest happened locke in as i say

i was not on to the game the car
seemed to rise up in the air and shoot off
sideways then it plumped down and
stood still then all was-silence i just
kept guessing the rest of the night and all
the next day consuming canned salmon
meanwhile till i was sick of it

    all that time bear in mind i heard
 trains passing my car right beside me

  had not been side-tracked for thered
 been no backing no pushing no slam-
 ming had the car been lifted bodily out
 of the train and placed on another track

 i gave it up and ate more salmon

    the second night though i heard
men come up a swearing all round my
car-a gang of em suddenly the car
got a move on bumpity-bump as if they


the railroad mans magazine

were hauling her over the ties in a
minute however we rolled on smoothly
as if on the rails again

the yardmasters smile

   in the morning the car was opened
and a man began unloading it i hid
behind the boxes when he went away
for dinner i skidooed i found myself in
gurdon arkansas more curious than
id ever been in my life to know what
kind of railroadin id been subjected to

i walked up to the yardmasters office and
asked for a job by way of getting safely
into a conversation

   the yardmaster seemed daffy about
something that had happened in the yard
laughed like he was dippy and mumbled
something about a  cock-sure conductor
tlien he turned to me and turned on the
gas and the long and short of his illu-
mination was this

   as that night freight of which my
car was a part neared gurdon whatd
that salmon diner of mine do but jump
the rails and slide to the left into a ditch

   now heres the freak part as soon
as my traveling restaurant cut herself
out whats the caboose right behind me
do but roll forward and couple herself

automatically to the train so much for
freak railroadin

   now for that part that made the
yardmaster smile out loud when that
freight-train pulled into the yard at gur-
don the conductor reported all present
and accounted for and went home to bed
in the wee small hours a call-boy woke
the conductor and told him a car was
missing from his train

    go chase yourself said the conduc-
tor  didnt i tab that car into the train
of course shes there

   thatll be about all mister except
that i expect that mop freight conductor
had to set up the soda-water good and
plenty for that yardmaster whats that
did the yardmaster give-me a job well
now he certainly approached me along
that line but you see i had the new
haven bee in my bonnet so i just sidled
away from that kind yardmaster

an inhuman mother

  heres another free-rider tale-the in-
human act of ft young mother that led to
the rehabilitation of a human derelict

  at los angeles-in the same month of
my visit to tacoma-i saw more tramps
in the railroad yards than probably could

be found in all
the other rail-
road yards of
california los
angeles in win-
ter is the hobos
paradise in the
santa fe rail-
road yard i
talked to many
of the arriving
free-riders and
the story of one
in particular has
an unusual
touch of pathos

   y o u fond
of babies he
said i am nearly lost my
life two nights ago-for a baby

 i was at the fag end of my
journey from kansas - nearing
los angeles kicked off a freight-
train i took a seat on the steps
of the rear car of the santa
rough-riders of the rail



fes crack train the california limited
hoping to ride into the city of the angels
in grand style

   just aftpr we passed a place called
cucamonga-as im a living man-i saw
a baby thrown from one of the forward
cars of the train i heard that babys
cries distinctly for the train was not
going very fast

what memory did

   in a flash i thought of my own
baby now lying in a kansas graveyard
thoughts of how happy id expected to
be with my baby now ran through my
mind my wife died you see and our
baby lived several months i took care
of him myself then he too left me

    that discouraged me i gave up i
drank i lost all pawned all went down
took to the road and here i am-a human
derelict

    while all that ive told you flashed
through my brain i jumped now when
you say a limited isnt going some you
mean faster than a freight but not fast
for a limited when i jumped i learned
how fast a limited is going when its going
slow for i can show you a body black and
blue and-just look at that swollen ankle

    i limped dragged myself up the
track to where the child lay in a mass
of soft mud it still lived blubbering
weakly  what fiend has done this awful
thing i asked myself

a helping hand

    would the baby live  picked it up
and petted it and then i exclaimed
just as if some one was listening  im
only a tramp what if i take this baby
to the nearest house maybe ill be
arrested for kidnaping no i must
leave the baby just as i found it and go
for help

    just east of the track  saw a light in
a window i made my way painfully
toward the light-found it was in a ranch-
house where lived a mr matlock i told
mr mattock of the baby by the track
and how it got there he wouldnt be-
lieve at first that any one could be so
inhuman as to cast a baby out of a car
window from a moving train when we
reached the baby mr mattock said

  i dont dare move that child without
authority ill telephone constable ruff
 while mr mattock was phoning i
took the baby once more in my arms i

im only a tramp

billed and cooed over it then when i
heard mattock returning with the con-
stable  kissed that baby laid it gently
in the mud and then slunk away into the
night like the tramp i am

    since reaching los angeles i learn
that they got the fiend who tossed that
six-weeks old baby from that car window
-a young woman of san bernardino
she hoped in that way to get rid of her
child think of it shes under arrest
the baby lived only a few hours after i
left it

driving them out

    i believe that my experience with that
baby has had the effect of arousing in me
an ambition to face the music once more
and work for a living im glad of these
bruises they make me think of my own
baby boy and of how maybe i ought to
work for him even though lie aint here

free-riders at this time were pouring
into los angeles in such hordes on every


the railroad mans magazine

freight-train that certain yardmen were
put on extra duty in the way of handing
the boes over to the police rough-riders
of the rail arrived in such big bunches
indeed that mayor harper and police
commissioner cole put their heads to-
gether and caused a sign to be placed in
the railroad yards reading like this

     hoboes stick to your pullfnans and
  keep moving

    long sentences in the chain-gang
  given here

     sixty to ninety days our specialty

--

  notwithstanding these warnings free-
riders arriving at los angeles forsook
their  pullmans  in such numbers that
sheriff hammel was obliged to keep his
shower-baths in the county jail going
night and day in an effort to maintain
cleanliness within his gates

  now among the tramps who submitted
with more than usual reluctance to the
sheriffs soap and water was one known as
idaho red-a free-rider whose arrival in
los angeles had been marked by a most
amusing experience

  idaho red was snoozing in an empty
box car when the train pulled up at a
desert water-tank there two other free-
riders climbed into idahos red car-
one a tall lanky man and the other fat
and very much sawed-off the garments
of the newcomers were torn and tattered
and covered with dirt and mud their
shoes were typical both were hatless

   howdy  said idaho red  youse
goin to los thats a awful town jist
now for us unhappies they pinch us
and parade us through the town in the
chain-gang got a chew

 im the governor

  all this time the tall thin man and the
short fat man glared at idaho red with
expressions of indignation as if to say
 how dare you be so familiar pres-
ently the tall man put his hand on the
bare and touseled head of the short man
and said

   this is the mayor of los angeles
and i-i am one of the police commis-
sioners

   glad to know your honors prompt-
ly replied idaho red  permit me to
introjuce me own self im the governor
of california

  just then a shack jumped into the car
and said  dig up-every ging in here
or out you all go

  i do not mean to imply that brakemen
on california trains are in the habit of
making tramps dig up in return for let-
ting them travel in peace i merely quote
the remark of one particular brakeman
as i got it in relation to this specific
instance

  idaho red dug up without a word
and the  mayor  and the  police com-
missioner  followed the example of the
 governor

  the shack then left the three free-
riders with the tacit understanding that
he would not report their presence to the
con and the tramps began an animated
powwow that continued during the re-
mainder of the journey to los angeles
the tall man and the short man plying
idaho red with dozens of questions con-
cerning the view-point of free-riders with
regard to their treatment by the authori-
ties in the city of the angels

  arriving in the los angeles yards
idaho red handed his new friends this
advice  now beat it for if youse linger
youse will get pinched sure

make a get-away

  the mayor and the police commis-
sioner made their get-away successfully
but sad to relate the  governor of cali-
fornia less spry than the others got
pinched before he left the yards and was
taken to sheriff hammels jail and sub-
jected to the indignities of suds and aqua

  coming from the shower-bath with a
look of reproach suggestive of the cat
that has just emerged from a rain-barrel
idaho red proceeded to relate the inci-
dent of his meeting with the short fat
man and the tall thin man in the box car

  when told that the short fat man was
really and truly the mayor of los angeles
and that the tall lanky man was actually
the police commissioner of the city idaho
reds remark was

 cert of course they were just the
same as i was the governor of california
but idaho reds friends were the offi-
rough - riders of the rail



   i am a vagabond i want to be a
vagabond the rest of my life i beg some-
times and i make in that way more than
most laborers im never sick-im happy-
all the time im better off than many
men who work i travel and see new
places new faces-and the railroads carry
me free

   an occasional thirty days in jail is
just a period of rest ive seen far more
of the world enjoyed my life more than
thousands of men who stick to then- jobs
and have homes and as you see ive
saved as much money-maybe more-
than men who kill themselves in order to
live ill probably be fined twenty-five
dollars to-day for vagrancy

 ill pay it and then ill meander
down to southern cali-
fornia for the winter
ride on the railroad
certainly why in half
the towns in this coun-
try the authorities take
us to the railroad yards
and order us to make a

cials they declared themselves to be why-
had they turned hoboes mayor harper
and police commissioner cole had set out
in an automobile to inspect certain public
works far out of the city out on the
desert their car became disabled and they
were obliged to foot it through rain and
mud for miles and for hours to the water-
tank station on the railroad thats all

 the lady riders

from railroad men and others in my
rambles about this country i have heard

howdy said idaho red youse goin to los

some strange tales of free-riders who
were  rich and of free-riders who were
 females

  in san francisco a southern pacific
man having a run into stockton told me
of a free-rider who had been yanked out
of a box car in the stockton yards and
taken to the lock-up he gave the name
of edwin hess when searched twelve
hundred dollars in currency was found 
his person

   hut why with all this wealth he
was asked  do you travel in box cars
instead of pullmans

  edwin hess made this extraordinary
reply

sneak out on the first freight that comes
along

  a d and r g man at denver told
me of a young hobo who was found in a
box car of a santa fe freight at colo-
rado springs and taken into custody a
startling discovery was made that hobo
was a girl her name was bessie boy-
ington her hair was cut short she
wore boys clothes she was pretty she
said she had been traveling about the
country for a year-free-riding on the
railroads along with men tramps

  and she didnt mind talking about it

   i feel jim-dandy she said  im
in perfect health and thats more than


the railroad mans magazine

can be said of girls who have not the
courage to turn tramp

the romantic part

  but though i could not learn all the
details the most romantic part of the
story of bessie boyington free-rider was
that when liberated from the jail at
colorado springs she fell in with a new
yorker of some wealth and married him
in hoboland on the colorado railroads
she was known as- ried-white-and-blue
bessie

  another female free-rider i heard of in
california she was the wife of a team-
ster of san francisco the teamsters
name was joaquin ferrer and he was a
member of the brotherhood of teamsters
after the fire he could get no work he
had saved not a penny and he and his
wife deliberately turned tramps

  after free-riding to los angeles and
back he brought his wife some money
he pictured to his wife the allurements
of free-riding and mrs joaquin ferrer
declared that she herself would become a
free-rider

  they set out together in a box car
having resolved to beat their way to los
angeles arriving there the husband
was arrested but the wife induced the
yardmen to let her go

  a couple of months later a hobo while
beating his way on a freight-train near
banning california fell asleep while
riding the rods he fell from the rods
was run over and both legs were severed
at the knee they took him to a hospital
at riverside and there found in his
pocket an old card of the brotherhood of
teamsters of san francisco bearing the
name  joaquin ferrer

the news spreads

  stranger than fiction that same day a
woman hobo emerged from a box car of
the salt lake route at riverside cali-
fornia and was informed by certain male
hoboes-among whom such news travels
fast-of the free-rider who had that day
been run over and lost both legs at ban-
ning and of how he had been brought
to the riverside hospital and of how he
had been identified as a teamster of san
francisco

  the woman hurried to the hospital
only to be told there that joaquin ferrer
had died a few minutes before her arrival
 my poor joaquin  she cried  i wish
this had come to me instead of to him
and mrs ferrer showed that the love
that passeth understanding exists among
free-riders just the same as among people
who pay railroad fare

 a free-rider of the lowest class fetched
up in tucson arizona on the rods of a
car of a southern pacific freight in
broad daylight he jumped boldly from
the rods directly in front of the southern
pacific headquarters building at that
moment a pretty girl happened to pass
the hobo looked at her once twice then
followed her up the stairs of the head-
quarters building to a room on the second
floor

  the girl was miss minnie clauberg
telegraph operator on duty from seven to
five every day in the week of a sudden
she looked up from her key to find the
poorest semblance of a man staring and
leering hard at her the stranger asked
her a number of questions none of which
miss clauberg answered finally the
greasy man slouched away

willing to marry

  next day miss clauberg found a bit
of wood lying on the table in her office
on which was scribbled these words  i
want a certain pretty girl for a wife

  she showed the billet-doux-which she
has to this day-to chief lineman jack
shahan who doubled his big hand into
what looked like a sledge-hammer and
said   you just wait miss clauberg
next day the free-rider showed up in
the hallway of headquarters on his way
evidently to miss claubergs room jack
shahan was right there too

  biff-bang-thud  down and out
went the tramp when he reached the
bottom of the stairs he saw something
more than stars he beheld tack shahan
standing over him saying 

   theres a freight pulling out of here
pretty soon you better travel on it for
your health

  he stood at the end of the depot plat-
form until it came along and then he
deftly slid into an empty but thank
heaven  his kind is pretty scarce

              an  wind blows some one good
              high under the southern cross

ou are accused of being
a mechanic what have
you to say about it
there was not a shade
-al	of relaxation or humor

  visible in the face of
philip amend senior member of philip
amend  sons contracting engineers

  he had turned abruptly in his chair
and launched this challenge into ronans
lax senses as though he
were casting a spear

   i will plead guilty to
that replied ronan qui-
etly and without a mo-
ments hesitation

   well its worse than
that continued the cool
and even voice of the se
nior amend  you are
accused of being a first-
class mechanic and it is
said that you can handle
men what do you say to
that

  ronan standing hat in
hand in the quiet seclu-
sion and rich plainness of
amends broad street
office was not the figure
of a man that a discrimi-
nating person would se-
lect to play with even at
long acquaintance

  there was a poise of-
the head and shoulders
an upstanding alertness
in his big clean - cut
body and most of all
a level steadiness of the
eyes that forbade famil-
iarity

  and yet mr amend was of necessity
a man of fine discrimination

  while he had never until then seen the
head of the house of amend ronan knew
new york-which is another way of say
ing that he knew both men and manikins
pretty well

  his calm eyes therefore made a swift
and comprehensive inventory of the severe
but good appointments of the big room in

sat down to wrestle with his problem




the railroad mans magazine

the center  which he stood fell in cool
scrutiny that seemed to crumple as by
frost the look of calm superiority on the
face of am ends secretary and settled
back with definite purpose on the face of
amend before ronan answered

   to advance the case as a whole what-
ever it may be i plead guilty to both
counts

  sitdown take this chair wont
you said amend after a moments si-
lence indicating a position where the
light of late morning must fall full upon
the face of ronan  you dont seem to
get rattled easily he volunteered when
ronan had settled into the chair close at
hand  perhaps we shall do well to get
better acquainted

   my son requested you to send in a
card when you could find the time yes
he did not say why or whither i pre-
sume no that was right so far and
now no doubt you would like to know
why we have ventured to make that re-
quest

   i should like to have you undertake a
small matter for us in a big way and
leave here as soon after to-day as you can
get your necessary belongings together

   where  asked ronan concealing
his surprise at the depth and intentness
of meaning that the conversation had sud-
denly assumed

   there replied amend whirling the
globe at his elbow with the swift touch of
long and constant use until his finger-tip
rested lightly upon a spot below the equa-
tor

  as what questioned ronan very
quietly while his eyes fastened upon the
place indicated and a dull flush of color
surged strongly into his face

   as master mechanic of three hundred
and odd miles of andean railroad and
first man in line for promotion was the
unhesitating reply

  ronan searched the face of amend for
a moment before he asked 

   the salary 

   eight hundred a month gold re-
plied amend   and you need not take the
trouble to go into your personal expe-
rience or attainments i know all i wish
to know about your previous history just
at this time when would you like to give
us your answer 

  ronan could not repress a smile as he

arose  but it was because of the unerring
certainty with which the conversation had
been launched and hurried to its evident
end and not because of any elation at the
suddenly opened prospect

  he had done things with locomotives
in the busy hives along the juniata he
had been captain of herders as it were
at the great open - air engine corral in
west philadelphia he knew also things
that can be learned only at first - hand
where chicago-the railroad sun of this
railroad firmament-radiates fleeing hur
rying locomotives to every point of the
compass as prodigally in proportion as
the veritable sun projects its shafts of
light

  he knew the mountains and the plains
and something of the peaceful valley work
of this land of endless railroads but in
that other land-that land of manana of
to-morrow below the equator- what

  he knew by report that ill winds have
a way of striking as from above that un-
toward things have a way of happening
there-where all except the white man do
all things to-morrow and where he too
unless he be made of tlie sternest stuff
soon lapses into that fatal lethargy of
manana

   in an hour  will return and answer
he said and with brief adieu passed out
to the elevators and to the din of the
street

  i thought so muttered amend
grimly smiling at the little peruvian sil-
ver grotesque upon his desk while the ex-
press elevator swiftly dropped ronan to
the street level  he will decide it to-
day-not to-morrow he is our man

  it was something of a decision for a
man no older than ronan to make lie
was not yet thirty he was well-estab-
lished in the railroad offices in a near-by
cross-street lie had the usual substantial
chances of slow promotion and meager
salary of the older eastern railroads

  there was of course permanent or
temporary relief by death or pension at
the end of the long run according as the
die might fall for him

  in sharp contrast to that an ever-pres-
ent allurement looming large was the
western railroad field-that mightiest of
industrial battle-fields holding forth its
tempting rewards of quick recognition
place money -and power to the young
big beyond belief in
south america whither
they were billed

ronans five minutes

clear-headed and capable the wander-
lust was strong in ronans blood he
had fought it at times as a man fights a
malady the spirit of adventure and the
indomitable pluck that had sent his scan-
dinavian grandfather pioneering into the
great northwest two generations ago had
in turn sent young ronan adventuring
eastward

  from altoona as an eastern begin-
ning he had grown by slow and painful
processes to a modest place in the official
line he had come to know new york
when the flush of his strength was at its
highest - when the sullen roar of the
citys life by day and the pregnant silences
of its nights thrilled him with a sort of
exaltation at the mere fact of survival in
that maelstrom of human life a score
of years per-haps would pass before he
could properly detest it and turn again to
the open

  the sense of nearness to the pulse of
the world the far reaches down t he bay
to the open sea the virile tang of brine-
soaked shipping at the piers and the rich

mixed odors of sea and cargo along the
water - fronts had from his first expe-
rience of them stung ronans senses

  but like a stoic he had held them all
in check with a master hand the gay
enticement of the citys life the call of
the west and most insistent of all the
call of the sea and of that mysterious land
of manana lie had put resolutely aside
until now he had come unexpectedly to
look upon a daring parting of the ways
when he had meant only to pursue the
staid and conventional path to a common-
place success

  reaching the street he thrust his way
unceremoniously through the fringe of
yelling curb brokers that overlapped from
the turbulent crowd in the middle of the
street and obstructed the sidewalk he
threaded his way more carefully through
the gloomy and cluttered narrowness of
wall street and crossing broadway en-
tered the gate of old trinity churchyard
and sat down in a favorite nook to wrestle
with his urgent problem

  there was nothing in the expression-


the railroad mans magazine

less marble slabs of the churchyard to
contribute to the answer save that fare
forth however bravely and where they
might all men came there or to a similar
pass at last but the chimes in the tower
ringing out the noon-hour sent a theme of
triumph and rejoicing down into the se-
cluded churchyard and out into the roar
of the street

  ronan arose from his seat and plunged
into the northward current of broadway
he suddenly felt that he must get closer
to the heart of the giant complex life of
the crowd once more before he could de-
cide

  shortly he was dropping from a car
at twentythird street and a few mo-
ments later he was seated in the glazed
bay of a near-by cafe corner where him-
self unobserved he looked out upon the
midday flood of humanity that hurls itself
impersonally upon the massivfe prow of
the flatiron building and falls away
again into the divided currents of broad-
way and fifth avenue

  ronan ate with the unabated hunger
of youth and perfect health and while
he was thus engaged the matter somehow
shaped itself in longer and more compre-
hensive perspective who would miss him
a year hence if he dropped out now from
that scurrying throng beyond the window-
ledge 

  he laughed quietly over his solitary
meal for answer

  well for the matter of that who would
miss him if he dropped into a crevasse in
the andes for a time and eventually
dropped out again

  the answer was not so ready

  a week later ronan was looking into
the open hold of a vessel tied up at the
spanish-american docks just north of
the battery he was carefully observing
the handling of numerous huge packing-
cases containing the detachable parts of
some locomotives big for their day and
generation but big beyond belief in south
america whither they were billed the
locomotives stripped as closely as need
be were already safely stowed in the ca-
pacious hold  and ronan was booked to
go out on the same boat to have one of
them later give him the worst five minutes
of his life

  no hint of that however appeared in
the repose of the big silent hulks of the

engines in the shadowy hold and of
course there was no hint of it in mr
amends parting instructions

   yes said he  i should like it if
you would go with the cargo you may
be useful before you get them ashore and
in any event i have a theory that a man
who works for us down there is the better
for going around the horn or through
magellan and looking at his job at long
range going up the west coast it gives
him a wider perspective

   then too if he is going to curl up
and wilt he generally does it when he
gets his first sight of the andes from the
pacific and goes right on up the coast
and reneges by way of panama

  not making any forecasts in the pres-
ent instance you understand but-well
it offers you a broader perspective as i
have said

   certainly i shall be glad to do
that replied ronan  that is he ha-
stily added in the tone of a man who has
no intention of reneging  i shall be glad
to go through with the locomotives

  some days later the ship was threading
the crooked ways of magellan and ro-
nan looking from the ice-hung crests and
rocky sides of its desolate mountains to
the forsaken inane faces of the terra del
fuegans crouching starved and half
naked on their littered shores in the sod-
den july midwinter silently thanked
providence and philip amend  sons
that his task lay elsewhere

  in due time the ship with its epoch-
making cargo covered the northward
coastwise journey to the open roadstead in
front of that little city well below the
equator where ronans real responsibil-
ity began

  he wakened one morning to find the
ship anchored and rolling in the sicken-
ing swell of waters that are ceaselessly
whipped and mauled by the chill ant-
arctic winds and that widening of his
perspective which the senior amend had
toretold and which had been progressing
apace since threading the straits was
greatly furthered when he turned his
eyes shoreward in the early morning
light

  from among all the days weeks and
months of lowering leaden sky that fol-
lowed while the pacific arched its saving
waters high upon the winds over the cor-
ronans five minutes



dillera to the fertile eastern slopes and
left the sterile coast untouched of rain
that first morning was reserved and set
aside for ronans welcome

  while he stood gazing spellbound over
the dry benches of sand and rock which
rise magnificently terrace after terrace
from the wind-swept shore-over the first
grand uplift of the giant mountains to the
vast table-lands beyond-the dim gray
background of the nearer heights was torn
asunder by a vagrant cross-current of the
upper air and the distant ultimate upper
heads of the second cordillera stood forth
for a moment pink white and tipped
with ice fire and gold against the im-
maculate blue of the sky

  that one glimpse of the mysterious
upper world of the mountains was brief
as it was beautiful the gray cloud-pall
closed its brilliant rift and ronans prac-
tical mind came back with an unconscious
sigh of regret to the rolling and wallow-
ing ship and the chortling and swaying
lighter-cranes which were already drop-
ping their tackle-blocks into jhe hold in
search of cargo to be lifted

   well said ronan to the first man
who came abreast of him on deck  a
man might fail here or up yonder -
with a sweep of his arm toward the van-
ished upper world- but he ought to
win and if he failed and died he ought
to be able to die well in a place like
that

   oh a man can win here said the
experienced one to whom he had spoken
 he can win  but it costs a price it
always exacts something which he lias not
offered and - yes men have died up
there

  a month saw ronan thriving in full
charge of motive-power affairs his three
big locomotives like himself were safely
located in the railroad headquarters town
one hundred miles back from the coast and
seven thousand feet higher in the moun-
tains the engines had worked their way
up satisfactorily thus far and now ro-
nan and the general superintendent ver
rill faced the task of taking them safely
up to their final assignment in the fast-
nesses of the higher cordillera

  thus an evening in august found them
sitting amid the wordy babble of the ala-
meda near the extravagant little fountain
of onyx that dripped and gurgled in the

mountain citys brave array of gay flow-
ers willows and eucalyptus all things
centered in the alameda and between its
rows of sparse trees and brilliant blooms
many things at one time and another
had their vivid inception from the first
lambent glow of a pair of liquid dark
eyes to the hasty making and the early de-
struction of dictators and dynasties they
were planning the dangerous ascent of the
higher mountains with the new engines
while distant illimani caught the last
golden glow of the sun upon its lofty
crest of snow and held its evening glory
high above the circle of the surrounding
heights

   two tunnels- ronan was saying
when verrill interrupted with an apolo-
getic wave of the hand

   three ronan  three in less than the
length of a decent rifle-shot-and twenty
more tunnels for the matter of that but
three where we bridge rio de los animas
de perditas at the highest and three times
we cross the river within a miles length
of track

   the channel there is in the form of a
big letter  s sunk flat six hundred and
fifty feet deep in the solid rock

   yes ronan quietly agreed  there
are three tunnels there but two of them
are tangent and west of the curved
bridges they need give us no special
concern it is the tunnel of nineteen de-
grees curvature opening directly off of
the first of those bridges-the bridge that
spans the canon from sheer wall to sheer
wall--that is troublesome

   the chief engineer declares that he
will not consent now to working the new
engines under their own steam across
those two bridges nor will he consent
to have them taken over coupled close to
a lighter engine i put in this whole
afternoon with him up there and there is
only one other way to take them across

  there he is now verrill call him
over and let us have it out with our-
selves you say you must have the en-
gines working higher up until these lower
bridges are strengthened

   ho merrill called verrill as the
engineer approached in the moving throng
beyond the first line of eucalyptus  will
you join us for a smoke

  a minute later the three men were deep
in the problem that confronted them


tpie railroad mans magazine

   no i cannot consent merritt was
saying with fixed determination  it
would be criminal the weight of the
water in the boiler and the thrust of the
driving-wheels upon the rails are the two
things that i cannot guarantee the result
of in addition to the dead weight of the
engine

   and to put two engines upon the
bridge at once is of course quite out of
the question the factor of strength re-
maining would be entirely too small and

i	will not consent

   mr ronan you spoke to-day of a
plan can we not consider it to-mor-
row 

  merritt had been long in the land of
manana and almost unconsciously he
spoke at times in the language of to-mor-
row

   to-night replied ronan  now
if you will

   the longest bridge there is one hun-
dred and sixty feet we have among our
stores a one-hundred-and-seventy-five-
foot hawser that will tow the empty en-
gine and a little more without its tender

   if mr verrill will agree we will
couple three empty hat cars behind to
supply hand-brakes hitch the rope to the
new engines draw-bar and send one of
the older lighter engines ahead to pull
her over the bridges and through the
short curved tunnel

   we have also some strong oaken
rollers which can be fastened by their
brackets vertically upon the short wall of
the tunnels curve at points that will fend
the rope from chafing upon the sharp
rocks after the live engine enters the tun-
nel once the strain of the rope is set-
tled upon the rollers they will be held all
the tighter and safer against the rock in
addition to the firm fastenings we can ar-
range for holding them in the beginning

  point by point they went over the plan
until it was complete in each particular -
and the following day witnessed the
operation in the late afternoon

  eleven thousand feet above the level
of the distant pacific the powerful little
locomotive was noisily dragging its giant
substitute through the half-twilight of
deep perditas canon between the en-
gines the big hempen rope stretched taut
over the straight bridge behind the dead
and empty new engine trailed three light

fiat cars each with its pair of mestizo
trainmen manning the brake-wheels for
emergency-dubiously but chattering in
excitement at the novelty of the thing

  wo hundred feet below the rio per-
ditas writhed and roared and tumbled in
its narrow bed and above the sheer
walls rose straight four hundred and fifty
feet to the ragged lips of the narrow
canon

  just ahead lay the last of the two
straight tunnels with its grade of one
hundred and ninety-five feet to the mile
and at its farther end the track again
crossed the perditas upon one hundred
and sixty feet of open curving- bridge
springing directly from one face of the
perpendicular wall of the gorge to the
opposite straight wall and disappearing
in the curving tunnel of nineteen degrees
curvature and heavy grade

  there at the nearer mouth of the
curving tunnel ronan with his hand
resting upon the first oaken roller-fender
well bolted to the face of the rock stood
upon the lofty steel webwork of bridge
and listened to the steady roar and echo
of the laboring engines exhaust

  he looked far down upon the writhing
waters and realized to the fullest that he
had hung his reputation and much more
upon that single straining rope that was
creeping toward him in the opposite tun-
nel shortly the working engine pushed
its front out of the wall of the canon at
the farther end of the bridge and crept
over to where he waited

  the plodding engine passed him slow-
ly and the slant of the great rope strung
taut from its draw-bar sheared its way
beautifully to place upon the oaken guard-
roller on the lip of the tunnel the
working engine disappeared when the
front of the new engine was just showing
in the opposite tunnels mouth and all go-
ing well

  then the dead engiiie loomed big in the
dull gray light upon the frail bridge
responding to the steady careful draw of
the rope the great hulk of her was
moving slowly across the middle of the
lofty steel srpan with ronan tensely
watching the smooth play of the rope
upon its fender when the one thing that
he dreaded occurred

  the steady exhaust of the working en-
gine now well on its slow way through
ronans five minutes



tlie short curved tunnel suddenly broke
to a muffled roar and ronan straightened
and stood clutching the rock like a man
struck deep and hard his eyes were
fixed upon the big straining rope which
suddenly seemed but a mere thread among
the massive cliffs

  while he stared helpless to avert it
there came the fatal sag that he dreaded
the great rope sank almost to the bottom
end of the fender-roll snapped upward
perilously and sank again

  the forward engine was slipping in
the drip of the tunnel the sanding f
the rail had-been allowed to fail

    	r r

the fender-roll at the
tunnels mouth ripped
loose with a crash

  aii instant more and it was done

  another sag and the rope caught-und r
the fender upon the rock the spinning
engine-wheels ahead caught hard upon
the hastily sanded rail and took fierce
hold the rope drew taut with a snap
against the first backward movement of
the dead engine and cars and the strain-
ing fender-roll at the tuitiiels mouth
ripped loose with a crash

 twice the rope sawed upward upon the
jagged rock of the tunnels curve and
then it broke with a great whip-like snap
and snarl that whirred and echoed
through the narrow gorge


the railroad mans magazine

  the backward half of it came writhing
and hurtling out of the tunnel and whip-
ping around the dead engine struck a
slashing blow above the heads of the
frightened trainmen

   set them  shouted ronan before
the first backward movement was fairly
begun  set the brakes 

  but they fell upon their faces and lay
there cowering while the engine and cars
rapidly accelerated
their slow back-
w a r d movement
and quickly disap-
peared in the
straight tunnel

  only for an in-
stant ronan had
stood paralyzed at
the sight of the
m e   s inactivity
and then he leaped
out recklessly upon
the cross - ties of
the bridge and
raced madly after
the runaway

  so quick was his
start and so cum-
bersome the trains
first movement
that in the begin-
ning he gained up-
on it he strained
forward in a heart-
breaking final ef-
fort in the tunnel
and succeeded in
touching the rapid-
ly receding pilot-
beam of the engine

but it drew stead-
ily out from under
his clutching hands
and thre w him
prone upon his face
in the darkness

 he gathered
himself quickly
and ran on again
to the lower end
of the tunnel just
outside he found
the f ri g h t e ned
traiii - crew nurs-
ing their bruises
huddled in a bay

dashing battered hulk and flying frag-
ments back and forth from
wall to wall

of the rock where they had tumbled off
pell - mell the runaway was hurtling
down the crooked canon scattering its
engine trappings at every curve and too
close shelf of rock

  with one bitter execration wrung from
him upon all the sullen ceaseless menace
of perditas canon ronan stood watch-
ing the destroying flight of the train
down the steep and crooked grade with
	verrills words of

  the morning ring-
  ing in his ears

     i have a trip
  up the canon to-
  day iu make it a
  point to be up there
  with my car and
  another engine
  when you make the
  pull over the last
  bridge 

     poor verrill if
  he met that awful
  bolt of destruction
  hurling itself down
  upon him in the
  canon - and he
  must if it stayed
  on the rails but lit-
  tle longer

     at the first sharp
  turn of the track
  a few hundred feet
  away ronan saw
  the wild careening
  of the engine sweep
  off the stack bell
  and running-board
  against the over-
  hanging point of
  rock as the first
  flying fragments
  lifted into the air
  he thought the end
  had come and held
  his breath while he
  waited to see the
  entire fleeing mass
  topple into the
  gorge

but she righted
herself and shot
out of sight with
the hats still dan-
cing on ahead
again he saw her
ronans five minutes



flash into view lower down and toss shiv-
ered fragments high in the air and into
the gorge while from far deep down
almost directly beneath him as it seemed
the feeble whistle treble of verrihs spe-
cial engine floated up chokingly strug-
gling for notice above the roar of the
river and the destroying runaway

  so it must be none but the maker
of the mountains could avert it now ver-
rill and his crew were doomed

  ronans mind flashed back in that in-
stant to the morning in amends new
york office and his own words then so
lightly spoken rang in his ears like the
knell of doom

    i will plead guilty io that 

  and what of this it had been of his
planning his execution-all his but the
stupefying slip in the tunnel against
which he had cautioned first and last
he saw his own life going out in dis-
honored memory as the price of the lives
of the men who would in a few moments
die down there below him almost within
his sight

   -ie saw in his minds eye all that and
more in those few crowded minutes and
then for the last time he saw the big
engine flash into sight again stripped
of its cars somewhere in the three and
a half miles through which it had mi-
raculously staggered

  even then it was only a -scant mile
straight away from him but far below
and speeding along  the mountainside in
af shaft of daylight that penetrated the
narrow barrel of the canon

  he saw her rush at the point of the
last distortion of the canon wall that
lay in the line of his sight she struck
it with a furious lunge that sent rails
and ties twisting and whirling in the
air and suddenly her head end went
down close upon the dizzy brink of the
gorge

  she threw her shattered cab crashing
in a mass of splintered rubbish ahead
of her into the depths and leaped after

it dashing battered hulk and flying
fragments back and forth from wall
to wall until the boiling waters far be-
low swallowed them

  and then while ronan stood fixed
and staring from his lofty lookout the
treble of verrills engine whistle came up
again more clearly and the little engine
drawing the superintendents car shoved
its bright brass-trimmed front end round
the lower point of the shattered curve
it crept to a stop in a shaft of gray
light just short of the six hundred and
fifty feet of spread track which the lost
engine had left in its final riot as the
only trace of the disaster

   that ended what ronan unhesitat-
ingly calls the worst five minutes of his
life and to those who are so fortunate
as to find him very comfortably even
luxuriously at home in one of the many
little earthly paradises of the andean
cities he will sometimes tell especially
if it be a newcomer who is inclined to
despair of south america how he once
sent in his resignation within sixty days
after life arrival there and how philip
amend  sons would neither accept
nor seriously consider it

  a very good while ago that was and
ronan is of the higher executive staff
noy but he can repeat without refer-
ence to his musty letter files just what
the senior amend wrote him upon that
trying occasion of his first time out
this is it

  that scheme of yours evidently had its
weak spot but we can better afford a man
who once in a lifetime drops  dovn
the canon trying to do something to-day
than to pay an everlasting tribute to niauana

  dont be too liberal with your plea of
 guilty your first one was all right but
 consstler it my turn to render a verdict in
your case and it is this

   not guilty-but dont do it again stay
with them young man

with safeguards that dishonesty has absolutely no terrors for them whether
it be within the ranks of the companys employees or without

     the thief be he large or small employee or working highwayman may
flatter himself that his trail is covered beyond possibility of discovery that
he may settle down tp enjoy his ill-gotten gains in peace and security at the
very moment when lie dismisses fear from his mind fate in the guise of a
special officer of the express company or perhaps the surety company that-
guaranteed his honesty may step in and tap him  the shoulder

     the long arm of the law reaches across plains and over mountains and
rivers distance is no obstacle and time no consideration sooner or later
justice overtakes the trembling fugitive and he passes into the domain of the
zebra stripes -			

the express companies have made secure the enforcement of
eighth commandment against dishonest employees and the
road-agents who once infested the mountains

the

ver since express companies
were organized their treas-
kue-boxes have had a pe-
culiar fascination for the
dishonest

   opportunities ftir steal-
inj money in transit not onlv by bandits
on the lonely roads but also by em-
ployees of necessity left unwatched for
many hours at a time with large sums in
their custody have been so exceptionally
favorable that the express companies rec-
ord of losses by theft is not approached in
tle history of any other business

  rut the eternal struggle for the sur-
vival of the fittest evolved as it always
does unusual remedies to meet unusual
conditions the express companies have
fought for self-preservation with an en-
ergy and skill that have at last rendered

them practically immune from depreda-
tions by thieves within or without

  so thoroughly is it understood by all
men that robbery of an express company
carries in its wake a retribution as inevita-
ble as death itself that in these days only
those below the average of criminal intel-
ligence will attempt it trains and stages
are held up nowadays only by boys whose
brains have been addled by trashy novels
and cigarettes

  the last stage robbery in idaho was
committed two years ago by two boys aged
eighteen and nineteen who had been
brought up  a lonely farm and who had
never seen a train until they were taken
aboard one by a wells fargo  co se-
cret-service agent four days after their
foolish exploit oh their way to trial and
certain conviction


the railroad mans magazine

  stealing by employees now occurs only
in extremely rare cases the last instance
of the kind occurred last august an
agent of the southern express company
had read newspaper accounts of the long
light against extradition from canada
conducted by greene and gaynor until
he became filled with the idea that he per-
ceived a legal device by which he could
avoid extradition for robbery accord-
ingly he began to lay plans to test his
theory

  he applied for leave of absence an-
nounced that he was going to canada on
a fishing-trip obtained passes for the
journey and finally started ostentatiously
for montreal helping himself to twenty-
one thousand dollars from an express
shipment just before he left he had
no difficulty in getting to canada-and
even less in getting back home again in
custody of a detective it only required
seven days to demonstrate that his theory
about the weakness of the extradition
treaty was all wrong

coping with the highwayman

  the story of the struggle of the ex-
press companies to protect their treasure-
boxes is fascinating there were two
widely different classes of enemies to meet
-those on the outside and those on the
inside the outside enemy the highway-
man offered the earliest and the most dif-
ficult problem because the express compa-
nies were young aiid therefore poor in re-
sources and experience and also because
the country ivas new and the machinery
of the law was not yet in good running
order

  in the days following the discovery of
gold in california montana and colo-
rado highway robbery was an easy prof-
itable and comparatively safe vocation
rather extensively followed by persons
with conscientious scruples against work

  when the vengeance of the vigilantes
made promiscuous murder and robbery
somewhat dangerous the holding up of
stages by masked men became more and
more common until wells fargo  co
who practically monopolized the express
business in the far west were forced to
take the lead in a war of extermination
upon highwaymen as the alternative to
bankruptcy

   the vicissitudes of this war which last-
ed from the earliest days up to 
make up one of the most picturesque chap-
ters in the history of the united states
it is also a notable example of how  in-
dividual enterprise  may be crushed by
corporate aggression

  some idea of the magnitude of this war
upon the highwayman may be gathered
from the fact that in the fourteen years
from  to  wells fargo  co
were robbed by highwaymen of four hun-
dred and fifteen thousand three hundred
and twelve dollars two guards four
drivers and four passengers were killed
in these robberies and six guards four
drivers and two passengers were severely
wounded

  there were three hundred and thirteen
stage robberies thirty-four attempted
stage robberies four train robberies four
attempted train robberies and three hun-
dred and forty burglaries of express of-
fices also seven horses were killed and
thirteen were stolen

  on the other side of the ledger five
highwaymen were killed in the act of rob-
bing tlie express eleven were killed while
resisting arrest and seven were lynched
for the crime of robbing the stages the
survivors two hundred and forty in num-
ber were sent to prison for long terms
at hard labor not one of the highway-
men escaped punishment much of their
booty was recovered

costly rewards

  to even die score in such conclusive
style cost wells fargo  co in rewards
percentages on treasure recovered salaries
of guards and detectives and expenses of
arrests and convictions the tidy sum of


  the plan of campaign was neither com-
plicated nor mysterious when a stage
was held up headquarters in san fran-
cisco would be notified as promptly as
possible and an operator from the secret-
service department would be sent to the
scene of the robbery often he had mere-
ly to lead a posse into the mountains on
a man - hunt which quickly resulted in
the killing or capture of the highwaymen
the celerity with which these hunts were
conducted is manifest in the court records
of california nevada and arizona for
express thieves and how to catch them 

example george adams robbed the stage
from san luis obispo to soledad cali-
fornia  the d of december 
twelve days later he was delivered at the
california state prison to begin a long
sentence for the crime

  still quicker time was made-in the case
of james casey who found himself in
state prison six days after lie held up the
stage from grayson to bantas on the d
of october  the usual time how-
ever that elapsed between the hold-up and
the joufney to the penitentiary ranged
from three weeks to three months depend-
ing on the time the courts required to
reach the case

tke life of a stage robber

  in a number of instances the high-
waymen eluded pursuit long enough to
hold up a second stage before their cap-
ture twelve men were active enough
to commit three highway robberies before
their inevitable fate overtook them four
held up four stages each another was
killed in the act of holding up his fifth
stage and still another looted six express
treasure-boxes before the secret service
gathered him in

  richard perkins held up a stage from
los angeles to bakersfield on the th of
december i s  was promptly captured
and received an eight-year sentence thirty-
fivt days after the crime not being sat-
isfied with this experience he held up an-
other stage within sixty days after com-
pleting his sentence he succeeded in re-
peating the performance six times more
within the ensuing six months then
wellfs fargo  cos secret service got
him and had himsent up for life

black bart the champion road-agent

  the record in highway robbery was set
by  black bart whose right name was
charles e bolton choosing the vicinity
of yreka california as his favorite field
of operations he held up wells l argo 
cos stages no fewer than twenty-seven
times in the eight years three months and
seven days that elapsed between his first
exploit and his capture ne stage he held
up four times at the same spot

  californians declared that the drivers
got so accustomed to being held up at

this point that they stopped the stage of
their own accord and held up their hands
whenever they approached the place
after waiting a few moments if no one
came for the treasure-box they picked up
the lines and drove oil

  black bart was always well dressed
always polite andhe never fired a shot
frequently he was so grateful for the
contents of the treasure-box that he
dropped into poetry which lie signed
 pos and left pinned to a tree or laid
upon a rock at the scene of his exploit
the secret-service men were frantic for
they could get no clue to the industrious
poet-highwayman

   but the pitcher went to the well once
too often at dusk on the evening of no-
vember   as the stage from sonora
to milton california reached the spot
where it had been held up on july 
 the familiar black figure stepped
out from behind the same old roc and
in its accustomed style drew a bead on
old bill moore the driver with the usual
courteous request lo hand down the treas-
ure-box

once too often

   now old billhad been held up three
times before by the selfsame iigure in the
black mask and he felt that his forbear-
ance was being imposed upon

  it made him mad clear through how-
ever there was nothing to do but obey
orders for the gentlemanly highwayman
certainly had the drop on him he kicked
the box to the ground and received a cor-
dial  thank you coupled with permis-
sion to drive on

  old bill went on his way until he
reached the bottom of a little valley a
quarter of a mile beyond and out of sight
of the scene of the robbery then he did
something which was in direct violation
of all the ethics of highway robbery he
stopped wrapped the lines around the
handle of the brakes crept back up the
road until he was within close range ol
the highwayman who was still wrestling
with the lock on the treasure-box and cut
loose at him with his revolver with
bullets kicking up the dust all around him
and singing about his ears the highway-
man departed with such extreme precipi-
tation that he left one of his cuffs behind
on the culf was a chinese laundry mark


the railroad mans magazine

  the laundry mark being identified en-
abled secret-service officers j b hume
and j n thacker of the express com-
pany accompanied by a couple of police-
men a week after the robbery to enter
the room of a quiet well-bred gentleman
who lived within a block of wells fargo
 cos office in san francisco with drawn-
revolvers and request him to hold up his
hands

  the quiet gentleman readily admitted
that he was black bart the  pos and
that he had committed the twenty-seven
robberies

  he admitted other things which made
old bill moore madder than he was on
the evening of his last hold-up for he
declared that he had often held up stages
with an empty gun and that on his last
adventure he had compelled old bill to
deliver the treasure - box by pointing a
fence picket at him in the gathering
dusk the picket looked enough like a rifle
to serve the purpose

  black bart declared that he had a hor-
ror of shedding blood that he had never
hurt any one in his life and that he would
have given up his profitable career of rob-
bery rather than fire a shot at a human
being

near the office

  he had lived for years within a block
of wells fargo  cos office had often
shipped booty stolen from the express
company over its own lines to his home
in san francisco and was in the habit of
taking his meals at a restaurant much
frequented by san francisco detectives
he was well educated well informed on
current topics a good talker and even
after his arrest exhibited genuine wit

  he had friends of the highest respecta-
bility was cultured in manner neat in
dress never swore and never gambled

  all this was of no avail for he met the
same fate that was so relentlessly meted
out to the coarser class of highwaymen
who were recruited chiefly from laborers
miners farm-hands and cowboys

 after the capture of black bart the
express companies had comparatively lit-
tle trouble with highwaymen until the
hard times of  when there was a re-
crudescence of the crime more particu-
larly in the region south and west of the
missouri river

  in the first six months of  there
-were twenty-one train robberies the ex-
press-car being the object of attack in
each instance in the latter half of the
year this form of robbery was even more
frequent the express companies were
in desperation and so were the railroad
companies

  meetings of the heads of both classes
of corporations were held to devise means
to stop the robberies the matter was taken
up in congress and widely djscussed in
the press

  guards on express-cars were doubled
and inventors everywhere busied them-
selves with models of bullet-proof cars
which nobody wanted because bullet-
proof cars could withstand dynamite no
better than any other kind

best prices for dead robbers

  there was only one thing to do and
the express companies did it they in-
structed their secret-service departments
to bring in every man who took part in an
express robbery regardless of cost and
to do it with a swiftness which would
make the industry of express robbing un-
popular

  the manner in which the express com-
panies preferred to have their train rob-
bers brought in w-as indicated by the
standing offer of the american express
company of five hundred dollars a head
for dead express robbers and only one
hundred dollars a head for live ones this
offer applied only to the common run of
train robbers in aggravated cases the
reward was greatly increased

  when the dalton gang which in less
than two years robbed the express com-
panies of three hundred thousand dollars
and killed four men in doing it was wiped
out at coffeyville kansas on the th of
october  the express companies sent
six thousand dollars by telegraph within
twenty-four hours after the shooting to
the men who did it this was supple-
mented by an additional ten thousand dol-
lars by mail a few days later

  c s cox the wells fargo  co agent
who fired the first shot and brought down
his man wras presented with a fine gold
watch and chain with an inscription com-
memorating his deed and jim spears the
liveryman who killed three of the gang
express thieves and how to catch them 

as fast as he could work the lever of his
repeating rifle was given a gold medal
in addition to his share of the money re-
ward

quite remunerative

  in short the hunting of express rob-
bers was made so remunerative that very
soon there were no robbers left to
hunt and for the last dozen years the
express companies have enjoyed an al
most complete immunity from stage and
train robberies that has left them free to
perfect a system of protection from dis-
lionest employees

  the prevention of theft by employees
presents a totally different problem from
that afforded by highwaymen and one
distinctly easier of solution the salaried
employee is higher up in the social scale
than the highwayman therefore when he
goes wrong he is easier to trace and fam-
ily ties and old associations exert a far
more powerful influence in bringing him
back sooner or later to the scene of his
crime where he may be apprehended at a
minimum of trouble and expense

  the system of checking used in the
express business is so elaborate that the
disappearance of a valuable package is at
once detected to begin with when a
money package comes into an express of-
fice it is receipted for and then sealed
by two clerks every man into whose cus-
tody the package is given must sign a re-
ceipt for it

down to a minimum

  if it goes from one principal point to
another it is placed in a safe with a com-
bination lock the messenger who lias
charge of the safe on the train never
knows the combination and therefore
could not open it without blowing it open
the only money packages he handles are
those destined to local points on his run
so even if he were inclined to be dishonest
his opportunities are circumscribed

  the chances given to a dishonest man 
to steal are reduced to a minimum by a
civil-service system by which all men in
positions of trust are tried out pretty
thoroughly in subordinate places before
they are permitted to handle money

  after a man has been advanced to a
place in which he may be tempted to be

dishonest he is safeguarded in a way
which has proved wondrously effective
every express-messenger must furnish a
bond from the american surety company
of two thousand five hundred dollars to
five thousand dollars according to the
importance of his run and every agent is
also placed under bonds ranging from five
hundred dollars to five thousand dollars
this is not done because the express com-
pany expects the amount of the bond to
recoup them in case of loss but because
the american surety company has a de-
tective staff which is not surpassed in the
world

capture is certain

  if an employee steals anything from
an express company his capture and pun-
ishment are as certain as anything human
can be if the sum stolen is less than the
amount of his bond the surety company
is notified and the express company gives
itself no further concern in the matter
if the amount of the theft exceeds the
amount of the bond the express company
detectives cooperate with the operators of
the surety company in running down the
culprit

  some curious notions are extant regard-
ing what takes place when an express
company is robbed the popular idea is
that if a messenger or other employee of
an express company were to decamp with
a large sum there would be agitated con-
ferences of officials frantic messages and
wild hurryings to and fro of an army of
detectives who would sacrifice appetites
and sleep in running down all sorts of
impossible clues

  the culfirit always shares this belief
and acts upon it he gets as far as pos-
sible from the scene of his crime in the
shortest practicable time and for several
months goes into hiding that is often very
good

impossible to get away

  what really happens in a case of rob-
bery is as far as possible from the popular
idea if an express-messenger en route
from new york to chicago were to dis-
appear from his train with fifty thousand
dollars to-morrow the trainmen would
notify his division superintendent as soon
as he were missed when the absent mes-


the railroad mans magazine

sengers run was checked up at chicago
the exact amount of his shortage would be
known and reported by wire with such
other facts as were available to the general
manager in new york

  the general manager would order the
message to be sent to the surety company
and dismiss the matter from its mind

  the president of the surety company
would give the message a casual glancfe
send it up to i lie secret-service department
and apparently forget all about it such
an event would be considered merely a
routine incident to be ground through
the proper department and that is all

  when the matter was referred to the
secret - service department a description
of the man wanted would be sent to each
of the twenty branch offices scattered at
advantageous points throughout the coun-
try with instructions to take him in if
found if on investigation no really sat-
isfactory clue were discovered nothing
further would be done all the operators
in the detective department would tuck
the description of the man wanted and his
crime away in a convenient corner of their
brains and go about their business ex-
ecutive officers of corporations are seldom
given to spending money unless they have
a pretty definite idea that something is to
be gamed by the expenditure and cer-
tainly the sending of detectives on wild-
goose chases is an unpromising invest-
ment

gets within gunshot

  nobody does any worrying but the
fugitive neither the express company
nor the surety company is in any hurry
to get the culprit back in the first place
haste is unnecessary  and in the second
place it is undesirable themoral ef-
fect of an arrest four years after a rob-
bery is considered much greater than if
made four weeks afterward

  but perhaps the consideraton of great-
est weight is that in ninety-nine cases out
of a hundred the fugitive will practically
arrest himself if given time enough that
is he will either come back where he is
certain to be seen by the operators- or
else he will betray his hiding-place by
some clue so unmistakable that his arrest
requires no effort beyond the journey to
get him

  the conduct of the fugitive from jus-

tice is singularly like that of a rabbit
when flushed by the hunter at first he
scurries wildly away then circles back to-
ward his starting-point until he is within
easy gunshot

  a few examples may serve to show
perhaps that the work of a detective is
more like the vigil of a cat for a mouse
than like the sherlock holmes of fiction
who racks his brains over a partly burned
match to determine whether it was struck
by a right-handed or a left-handed man
and finally reaches the sagacious conclu-
sion that it was used by some one who
wanted a light

without an effort

  f p beers wells fargo  cos
agent at campbell hall new york six
years ago took a shipment of four hundred
dollars and disappeared the case was
duly reported and promptly forgotten by
every one but the operators in the secret-
service department of the surety compa-
ny beers had never had a photograph
taken so the operators had only his de-
scription to work on eight months after
beers disappeared w l johnson one
of the surety companys operators noticed
a man on broadway who had evidently
just arrived from the country judging
by the way he was staring about him a
closer look revealed a face and figure
that tallied with the missing beers john
son stepped up behind the stranger struck
him a resounding slap between the shoul-
ders and exclaimed

   why hallo beers why did you
take that four hundred dollars and leave
your wife atcampbell hall

  the man was so startled by the slap
and the question that before he could re-
gain his self-possessiosi he blurted out

   i had to

  then he realized that he had betrayed
himself and followed johnson shame-
facedly enough to meet his fate

  george brooks alias hamilton mcau-
ley formerly a telegraph - operator was
adams express agent at west hickory
pennsylvania in  his knowledge
of telegraphy and the express business
enabled him to evolve the most ingenious
scheme in the history of the company for
robbing the safe of one of the messen-
gers
express thieves and

how to catch them 

   taking a telegraph - instrument he
 went to a lonely spot a mile outside of
 templeton pennsylvania sent a message
 purporting to be from george bingham
 the division superintendent of the express
 company ordering thomas bingham the
 messenger he knew would be on the run
 from oil city to pittsburgh that day
 to turn his run over to hamilton mcau-
 ley at templeton and return to parker
 to await orders then he cut the wires so
 the message could not be verified then
 mcauley went to the station and waited
 for binghams train

   as everything seemed regular enough
 bingham turned his run over to mcau-
 ley in accordance with the fake telegram
 mcauley checked bingham out in proper
 style and went on to pittsburgh there
 he checked out and while on the way
 from the depot to the express office took
 a package containing ten thousand dollars
 -and disappeared

finally caught

   he succeeded in getting to brazil aft-
 er the lapse of four years he concluded
 that as he had never seen any indications
 of pursuit he might safely venture back
 home he was getting homesick and be-
 sides he was nearly out of money he
 returned to oil city under the name of
 clyde p hamilton and was arrested on
 the st of may  within twenty-four
 hours after his arrival tried convicted
 and sentenced to four years

   he had been recognized by an operator
 of the express company when he landed
 in new york followed to oil city to
 savedelay in extradition and arrested

   george t bagley a united states ex-
 press messenger running west-out of chi-
 cago on the rock island  the th of
 november  took a shipment of one
 hundred thousand dollars and left his car
 at davenport iowa the trainmen im-
 mediately notified the division superin-
 tendent of the express company just
 eight hours after his crime had been com-
 mitted bagley stepped off a train in chi-
 cago into the arms of an express company
 detective who was waiting for him the
 detective had rightly concluded that bag-
 ley would hurry back to chicago as af-
 fording the best place for concealment
 pending a chance to leave the country

every cent of his booty was recovered and
twenty-four days later he was sentenced
to three years in the penitentiary

to the antipodes

  paul hume a wells fargo  co mes-
senger running between sacramento and
redding california absconded with
three thousand dollars on the th of
march  he managed to get on
board a vessel bound for honolulu and
after wandering aimlessly about from
port to port in the pacific he reached
brisbane australia in september of the
same year here he imagined himself
safe but in less than a month a man
stepped up to him in the street and said

   well hume i guess its about time
for you to go home and take your medi-
cine

  t c valentine an express agent at
elgin illinois absconded eight years ago
with a shipment of ten thousand dollars
he succeeded in getting to bluefields
where as he knew nicaragua had no ex-
tradition treaty with the united states
he thought he would be safe

   in six weeks an operator for the amer-
ican surety company who had followed
the trail he had so plainly left found him
on a coffee-plantation in the interior the
operator talked the matter over with val-
entine saying that while he could not be
taken back against his will the best thing
for him to do was to return take his pun-
ishment and begin life anew

getting him back

  the operator pointed out the obvious
facts that the country was extremely un-
healthful and that even if he escaped the
fever he was among strangers who could
not speak his language that his money
would soon be gone and that he would
have  means of getting more that he
was far away from friends and that he
had condemned himself to a worse fate
than that which awaited him at home

  valentine agreed to go back with the
operator they returned to the coast and
while waiting for a steamer to take them
home valentine was stricken with yellow
fever no one would go near him but the
operator who had run him down he
nursed valentine tenderly till he died
-year-old pass still good

the remarkable history of an old-time  free ticket  issued by
the texas and pacific railway company and the
men who were connected with it

by c a beehn

in marshall texas is an old-time rail-
road pass which may prove interesting
on account of its age and because the men
connected with it are now prominent in
business in different parts of the united
states

 this old pass is the property of j e
powell familiarly called  al  powell who
is conductor on the louisiana division of
the texas and pacific railroad mr pow-
ell has had it in his possession for twenty
yeajs he values it highly through his
kindness a facsimile is reproduced here

  when mr powell first saw the pass lie
expressed a wish to own it it was then
several years old about a year later when
the owner was traveling on the train upon
which mr powell was conductor he said
al you want this old pass very badly
dont you   and when mr powell expressed
a wish for it it was given lo him as a
souvenir it is in good condition yet

  the pass was printed in marshall in the
iron age office about  or  by w b
clark who then ran the print-shop on the
public square the texas and pacific rail-
road issued it august   to floyd
shock jiho at that time represented van
beek benard  tinsley printers of st
louis and reads  from marshall to shreve-
port account of the transportation de-

partment good one way only not good

unless used within--days from date

 and not transferable

  it is signed by john f dickson general
 superintendent and countersigned by w h
 newman g f and p a its number is
 m

   strange to say that though this old pass
 is nearly thirty-seven years old all of the
 men whose names appear  it are - still
 living and are prominent business men in
 various parts of the country

  floyd shock to whom the pass was is-
sued was then a traveling man and is now
in the central national bank st louis mis-
souri

  john f dickson who signed the pass as
 general superintendent of the texas and
 pacific railroad was the founder of the
 marshall car wheel  foundry company
 and is now the owner of the dickson foun-
 dry at houston texas

  w h newman who countersigned the
pass as general freight and passenger agent
of the texas and pacific railroad is the
same bill newman widely known in the
railtoad world who for many years past
was president of the new york central
lines and is now a director in many of the
largest railroads in the united states

  mr newman who began his railroad ca-
  reer in marshall has
 gone up as high as any
 one could in his profes-
 sion and is recognized
 as one of the greatest
 railroad men in the coun-
 try still makes occasion-
 al trips to marshall

  the pass was never
used and is still good
because it bears no time
limit it is stated that
the reason it was not
used was because shortly
after it was issued yel-
low fever broke out in
the neighborhood of
marshall

issued in -and still good

ing-watchman of pippenville-his fancy

won him a wife and his system
which he alone defied

s soon as a village reaches a
population of five hun-
dred it organizes into a
town or city elects a
board of trustees and puts
on a few airs it gets a
town marshal with a star sometimes cut
from the bottom of a tomato can it gets
a debt that will run into the next genera-
tion and then proceeds to enact a few
ordinances for the regulation of its in-
ternal affairs

  usually the curfew ordinance comes
first then a pig ordinance then a pedler
ordinance then an cfinance compelling
the railroad to place a flagman at main
street where the railroad crosses

  there is nothing so satisfying to the
board of trustees as the flagman ordi-
nance it gives the town the same metro-
politan aspect that the bonded indebted-
ness does it advertises 

  when the passenger-train pulls over
and the passengers see a flagman at the
crossing and get a fleeting glimpse of the
odd fellows block up the street  the
corner they cast up the place as of some
importance

  this is gratifying to the local pride
and doesnt cost the town a cent

  a railroad does not always enthuse over
the crossing-watchman proposition

  it will now and then succeed in com-
promising the matter with the town coun-
cil by installing an electric signal at the
crossing

  this is a mechanical arrangement that
gives warning of the approach of a train
by monotonously tapping a gong thereby
notifying all concerned to  look out

  the gong outfit is not always satis-
factory to the town trustees as it spends
no money and adds nothing to the popu-
lation the human crossing-watchman
counts one and his pay goes to the mer-
chants

  crossing-watchmen divide into two
general groups

  one is provided with a dog-house
or  shanty his working equipment
consists of a lantern and a white flag
when a train approaches he sallies forth
to the middle of the street and personally

the railroad mans magazine

  the other kind is more aristocratic

  he lives in an elevated house and by
a simple device raises and lowers an arm
or gate across the street without the neces-
sity of going outside he is the city
watchman

  in all the small town and country cross-
ings only the first-named are employed

  quite naturally then when the faith-
ful chronicler of the thoughts and deeds
of railroaders seeks to write of a job with
an active-personality connection he tags
the watchman who marches out into the
middle of the street with motion gesture
and loud command who seizes the reins
of high-stepping horses who lays heroic
hands on some aged venturer and who
violently yanks some reckless youth from
threatened danger

  thats a real crossing-watchman

  the man who from an elevated loft
taps his bell a few tinjes then merely
raises and lowers an arm over the street
has no personal contact with the passing
throng

   that kind of a jobs a snap said
hiram benson lightful when  men-
tioned the citcrossing-watchman they
dont have to stand right out in the street
in all kinds of weather and take a hand
in it and git cussed and bumped around
and run over like we do any old woman
can dowhat they do he added contempt-
uously	t

  i have wanted to write of hiram and
hirams job for some time

  if all the crossing-watchmen in the
land were mustered into one battalion it
would far outnumber the old continental
army so they deserve a passing line in
railroad literature

  hiram may be pardoned for speaking
disrespectfully of the city watchman
perhaps the city watchman could put one
over on hiram if he were asked we
might start something-say the outside
vs the inside crossing-watchman  but far
be it

  leave it to statesmen clergymen doc-
tors and explorers to view one another
with distrust ridicule and contempt if
hiram has a little of the same for his co-
workers it is only a human quality no
discredit to hiram for it

  hiram is watchman at the main street
crossing at pippenville every day from six
to six

  he carries a white flag in one hand
with which to wave the street traffic to a
halt when a train approaches

  his whiskers are of times kindly
frost discolored by tobacco-juice a man
with amber-stained whiskers-will tell you
all-any time-anywhere-and glad of
the opportunity

  i sat down in hirams  shanty i do
not know why such opprobrious names are
given for a watchmans house as  shan-
ty  and  dog-house

   as a rule they are nice neat tidy little
houses with windows all around a good
chair and one of those heavy little iron
stoves that radiates warmth to every nook
they areobservatories and they deserve
a more classic and dignified name

   the walls were decorated with dazzling
pictures of beauties near beauties and
semibeauties lifted from the wide selec-
tion of pictorial advertising three cal-
endars stood out in bold reminder of the
passing days a crossing - watchmans
house always contains calendars no one
knows why the watchman is on the job
every day of the year and why he should
have occasion to mark the clays or the
months since they are all exactly alike
to jjiim no one knows

  but the beauties they were eying me
with coquettish squints or open-eyed inno-
cence from every angle

    where did you find this collection of
angel-faces hiram  i asked

   whenever i run acrost a purty one

i git it and tack it up inside he replied

 them is some of the finest that ever
peeped out all us erossin-watchmens
is old uns-and broken down maybe
you never thot of that everything else
gits old and stale to an old man except-
except the face of a purty woman when
 git so  dont care to look on them any 
longer i reckon therell be some doins
for the undertaker

   how long have you been with the
company hiram i asked

    lets see said he  what year was
it old horace greeley run for president
in  wasnt it i went to work on
the section the year before that makes
thirty-nine years doesnt it guess thats
it thirty-nine years

   didnt they ever offer you anything
better hiram didnt they ever want to
boost you  
observations of a country station-agent 

  me why ding my hide i didnt
give em a chanct whenever they crowd-
ed me eny id slow up and i kept a git-
tin slower an slower until they put me
to watchin this crossing

   ive always heard i said mildly
 that the engineer is the man who is the
 high ike on the life-saving stunt and
that next to him is the train-despatcher
and next the telegraph operator then the

we dont git no credit for savin human life

  hiram bit off a chunk of dog - leg
twist it inspired a new thought

   guess this is about where i belong
ill tell you more of em dont go up eny
theyre too durned lazy and careless same
as me i-iere comes the switch engine
wait till i stop that mule team

   watchin a crossin is one of the most
responsible jobs on a railroad said hi-
ram when the engine had gone by

   is it i replied  i never thought
of it in that way

   course you never hev nobody does
if it wasnt for watchn em all the time
theyd be a lot of people killed on these
crossings we dont git no credit for
savin human life but theres thousands
of people who ort to thank us to-day that
they air still on earth

section foreman so that puts you hiram
along about-number five on the list

   section foreman  telegraph oper-
ators   exclaimed hiram  huh  how
do they git in on it hiram spat con-
temptuously into the corner of the shanty
 i aint never seen eny section foreman
or telegraph operators wearing eny of
them carnegie-breastplates

   there isnt any such thing as the in-
ternational union or the amalgamated
association of crossing-watchmen is
there hiram

   they aint no order of us replied
hiram  cause theys no way we can git
together if we was organized and cud
all go out wed tie up the road tightern
blixin

   i cant figure that out i said


the railroad mans magazine

  canteh why
its cause the lawd
git after them right
away crossing-
watchmen is all
fixed by statutes

theyve got to be
and every day too

if theys eny miss
the railroads ul git
soaked you bet

wed have em all
right the law
dont make eny ex-
ceptions on account
of strikes the raiv
roads ud be liable
every day until we
returned to work

aint eny others got
that kind of a holt
on em

  but hiram

 protested  they
wouldnt be over
an hour and a half
finding some one to
take your p lace

there are hundreds
of old men everywhere who would jump
at the change of a life tenancy in this neat
little bunga  and at the easy work you
have to do

  thats what you say exclaimed
hiram with warmth and bearing heavy
on the you they cant git em i-
tell you every time theys a vacant
crossing it takes a week or ten days to find
some one thatll take it they cant git
em aint easy work either youre
like everybody else that works on a rail-
road all the other fellows got a nice
easy job ive heard em all talk never
heard one yet but what thinks hes got tlie
worst of it and everybody elses got it
better an him

   when eny one tells me watchin a
street-crossing is a nice easy job i ask
em did you ever do any of it they say
no they havent but they seen it done
then  tell em its always easy seein
things done and that they got the wrong
answer and to guess again no sir
they couldnt fill our places

   you see if wed go on a strike id
picket id march up and down and
around the crossin every day while the

strike was on a
picketin do you
think e n y b o d y
would want to take
this job and scab
while i was doin
picket duty right
agin him an
then the company
ud git soaked every
day they wasnt a
watchman on duty
before a week
theyd be dinged
glad to arbitrate
an wed all git a
raise

  i- iram chuckled
as if the whole cam-
paign had been un-
dertaken and trium-
phantly pulled off

  aint everybody
can watch a cross-
ing and do it as it
ort to be done
hiram continued
 ive been right
here six years and
i got a system they wasnt eny system
when  come here it was two or three
years before i got the people educated to
my systeoi

   you cant watch a crossing by just
posin you cant stand out there like one
of them mile-posts you got to move
about and see whats eomin and calcu-
late velocities and then motion em over
or motion em to stop

   my idea was to teach em all to de-
pend on me-to watch iir not to rub-
ber up and down the tracks theirselves
but to keep their eyes glued on me and i
give em the sign what to do

   i know about all tlie teams and about
everybody that drives acrost and they
all know me theyve learnt my system
and they watch for me to motion em
they ali depend on me

    at first they didnt pay eny attention
to me but when id go up and grab the
horses by the bridle they begin to take
notice and soon they was understandin
that heres a man that knows his busi-
ness

  the switch-enc-ie returned with a
string of cars and hiram sauntered out

t
observations of a country station-age nt 

with his white flag to stand guard until
it passed

  he returned to the shanty with a
sprightly step he took oft his old cap
and substituted a respectable derby then
he stood before an unframed fragment of
a mirror tacked against the wall and
combed his whiskers into a flowing ele-
gance

  then fie strode briskly forth to the
middle of the street again and assumed
as i thought a rather heroic pose

  there was no train in sight but i heard
the rattle of an approaching vehicle

  it came to a stop at a safe distance
from the track

  the driver was a red-cheeked woman of
fifty-five or sixty and driving a cart
loaded with the products of a truck-patch

  hiram craned his neck in both direc-
tions up and down the track then step-
ping nimbly aside called out  all right
mrs doud come acrost 

   thank you hiram said the wom-
an smiling expansively

  hiram lifted his stiff hat and bowed a
chesterfieldian acknowledgment

  that was very neatly done hiram
said i when he returned to the shanty
 still i dont see why you should have
been so overcautious

   thats widow doud said hiram
with a sort of sheepish apology  she
kind o depends on me she dont like to
go over unless i tell her its all right its
part of the system ive built up of cross-
in-watchin

  hiram took off his stfe hat and hung
it up on the hook very carefully then
he put on his old cap and eyed himself
in the glass critically

   you wouldnt take me to be sixty-
five would you he asked rather ab-
ruptly

   why hiram i replied warmly
 you dont look a day over fifty this
kind of a life agrees with you you are
good for an even hundred on this job

   maybe so said hiram  but some-
times i git an idee ill quit it i git to
thinkin- that doud woman aint bad-
lookin is she 

  this sudden and seemingly irrelevant
turn of the conversation took me by sur-
prise

  why no hiram i acknowledged
 shes a little broad across but she has
a pleasant face

   shes a widow and she owns a thirty-
acre truck-patch down on the river bot-
tom they tell me she makes three or
four hundred dollars a year on it and

j norman lnmd

 r r

chaseb me round that vegetable wagon three times


the railroad mans magazine

does all the work herself thats a nice
business-truck-patchin when you re-
duce it to a system

  hiram parted his whiskers in the mid-
dle and gave them an artistic brush on
both sides then he went 

   i wasnt on this job moren a week
but who should drive up but mrs doud
they hadnt been eny system in runnin
this crossin before then so she didnt pay
eny attention to me even when i made
a motion for her to stop

   the local was just about to back out
from the freight - house track but she
never stopped so i just steps up in front
of her old gray horse grabbed the reins
and brought it to a standstill all of a
suddent

   the woman had just gotten up out of
her seat and was kind o leanin over to
see for herself if eny train was cornin
when i yanked the horse she just went
on out over the dashboard and lit on her
head

   when she got up she was madder
then thunder she chased me around that
vegetable wagon three times before she
got out of breath i tried to reason i
said  madam theys got to be system to
this crossin business then she just
hauled off and smashed me right in the
eye with one of them ripe tomatoes of
hern that riled me somethin fierce and
we had a heated argument right there a
big crowd gathered round to hear it

   moren a year that woman wouldnt
look at me finally when she got to un-
derstandin the system i had in runnin
this business she come off her perch and
weve been good friends ever since

  i assured hiram that in every depart-
ment of railroading it is a hard struggle
to make people understand and appreciate
the things we do and the provisions we
make for their safety but that persist-
ence and good nature would in the end
win and that when once educated they
are thankful to us for our efforts in their
behalf

   thats so  exclaimed hiram with
enthusiasm  she is shes told me so
shes told me that maybe i saved her life
that time

   how long have you been a widower
hiram i asked by way of injecting a
little human sympathy into the conversa-
tion

  ten years the tenth of last march
this crossin job aint so bad for a single
man ive salted away over three hundred
dollars since ive been here groceries
air all-fired high now aint they do
you think two could live about as cheap
as one can board  

  hiram didnt wait for an answer to
that one but made haste to add

   what youre speakin about is right
its hard work to make people come to
your way of doin things theys a fellow
that drives a mule team for the rubber
works that dont want to pay eny atten-
tion to me some day hell git his all
right

   then theys a young fellow comes
along here every once in a while in a big
red automobile hes a smart aleck if
no  would just toss him over into the
next county some day they wouldnt be
eny regrets from yours truly

   theys some drivers that ort to git it
they dont care themselves and they ort
to be smashed up once in a while and
that would help us to keep others from
bein too risky

  no  whistled for the station and i
walked out with hiram to the middle of
the street

  a quarter of a mile away a red auto-
mobile was headed toward us and coming
at a merry clip

  thats him exclaimed hiram ex-
citedly  thats that young upstart and
his red devil i was tellin you about ill
git him stopped this time all right cause
 is cornin hes got to stop while
hes waitin for  to pull over ill let
him know theys got to be some system to
this hereafter

  it was a question which would arrive
first  or the auto both were racing
steadily forward

  it did not matter to hiram how the
race appeared he had but one idea and
that was to stop the auto and upbraid the
young fellow good and plenty for past
recklessness

  hiram went through furious gyrations
with arms and flag

  i noticed the young fellow bend slight-
ly forward and put on a little more power

  by this time hiram was whirling
around like an air-motor in a hurricane
and yelling warnings at the top of his
voice
observations of a country station-age nt 

  there was a sort of swish and a zip and
a red streak and hiram picked himself
up twenty feet away whither he had spun
like a monorail gyroscope

  hiram shook his fist at the vanishing
destroyer in impotent rage

   hang him  ill git even with him 

tions himself immovably in front of the
waiting engine and they who pass slowly
by - mourners near mourners and the
friendly curious-know that he would be
prostrated and mangled before he would
allow the engine to break the impressive-
rhythm of the procession

 j-mfvm llmd 
hiram had defied the system

ill steer him in front of the limited
ill lead him to it i will-so help me 
 no use hiram sakl i in mollifying
tones  that fellow will never stop to
give you a chance hes one your system
cant touch

  there are moments of pride and im-
portance in hirams duties

  when a funeral cortege approaches he
takes down his red hag and holds up the
railroad traffic until the last carryall of
the long line has moved solemnly across
the track

  he poses a little in this act he sta-

  it pleases hiram that the engineer
conductor and other members of a traiiii
crew recognize him as they pass and give
him the railroad salutation-a wave of
the hand

  he doesnt know any of their names
and he doesnt exchange a dozen words
a month but they know him and he
knows them

   thats one thing id hate about quit-
tin this job lie said to me  i got so
many dost friends on the road id hate
to leave em

  he has a bit of lawn surrounding


the railroad mans magazine

his shanty which he has given a gar-
deners attention for many years and
which is trim and clean as a velvet carpet

  mrs doud surveying it from the com-
fortable vantage of her vegetable-cart
complimented him on its neatness

   these surroundins make a man kind
o sentimental about quittin a job that
lies took a pride in so many years said
hiram  but im gittin to an age
where i got to begin to figure  some-
thing ahead ive got to look out for hi-
ram a little sentiment or no sentiment
he paused reflectively then added

   meats awful high i was readin in
a paper the pullman conductor throwed
off to me the other day that the secre-
tary of the treasury or interior or com-
missioner of patents or pensions or some
one high up says it aint goin to git eny
cheaper for a good many years

   then thinks i to myself thinks i
if meat keeps so high people will haft to
eat vegetables nows the time to go into
the vegetable business future looks good
for truck-patchin

   go to it hiram i said encouraging-
ly  opportunity knocks but once on the
dog-house door hes been a long time
finding you but at last hes tapped arise
and follow 

  it was not a great while after that

there was a new watchman at the main
street crossingand widow douds vege-
table cart with a new driver approached
from down the street

  no  whistled for the crossing

  the new watchman got out into the
middle of the street and waved his white
flag once or twice in a listless sort of way

  the new driver of the vegetable cart
gave his horse a cut and came spurting
forward entirely ignoring the watchman

  the watchman grasped at the horses
bridle but the driver with an explosive
command laid on the whip so vigorously
that the horse broke away and lunged
forward

  the reader may recall what our reminis-
cent grandmothers tell about the shooting
stars of  this time the pyrotechnics
consisted wholly of turnips and cabbage

  hiram wasnt hurt much he picked
himself up before the bystanders got to
him he shook his fist violently at the
new watchman

  look what you done dont you
think i know this crossin if you hadnt
laid your hands on the horse you dinged
muttonhead id a got acrost and 
wouldnt a hit me ill report you i
will youll git yours 

  hiram had defied the system

startling railroad statistics

the most marvelous array of statistics
presented for some time past was that
offered by the bureau of railway news and
statistics these figures are so stupendous
that one can scarcely comprehend their real
meaning as they stalld in orderly rows di-
vided into groups of three by portly com-
mas figures are mounting up so rapidly
nowadays that the statisticians have to keep
on hand an ample supply of ciphers

  in ten years nearly seven billion people
were carried by the railroads of the united
states and in a single year  one and
one-half billion tons of freight were trans-
ported over the shining rails from one part
of the country to another

  the weight of the individual locomotives
has increased  per cent and the number
 per cent there being now almost 
puffing over the united states the increase
in the capacity of freight-cars has been ap-
proximately  per cent making their pres-
ent carrying capacity more than 
tons

  perhaps the statistics giving the number of
railroad employees are the most impressive
nearly a million and a half people an in-
crease of  per cent are now on the pay-
rolls of the united states railroads draw-
ing a compensation of a billion dollars a
year an increase of  per cent over ten
years ago

theories are all right but blue-prints build no bridges-growls of the

       construction foreman
a heart of the north

by george van schaick

       pierre meets anne marie and learns why
       there is a great tragedy in her life

        chapter i
        the upset canoe

  he roar of great falls began
to boom through the mist
olltillll iil  of the morning and became
so i  louder with every stroke that
fiji sent the birch canoe lustily
up-stream great boulders
lined both shores and beyond them in
hazy faintness rose the serrated line of
the forest-trees

  to pierre ferguson there was music in
the drip of the paddle in the tremulous
sigh of aspens in the song of the dark
water as it rushed by him deep and dark
bearing great ragged flecks of foam

  the crashing of the cataract came
nearer and the water whitened with the
spume that was whirled in great eddies
then the man saw the place where the
portage began it was a sandy spot
nearly at the foot of the falls whose
heavy spray blew over it

  near it was an old camping-ground
surrounded by rotting tent - pegs and
brown with the dead successive layers of
rusty fir-boughs that had formed the bed-
ding of previous voyagers charred ends
of logs marked the site of the fires that
haxl been lighted there

  a stroke of the paddle brought the
canoe along the side of the tiny beach
and pierre stepped ashore preceded by
his dog a rough irish terrier that began
to search at once for a possible hare or
squirrel barking in delirious joy at the
number of lovely smells he alone knew
how to enjoy

   in the meanwhile his master began to
empty the canoe of its contents there

  were several large water-proof bags and
  a smaller one holding an aluminum
  cooking outfit the fishing-rods which
  were lashed to the side of the canoe
  were allowed to remain there but the
  gun in its canvas case was carefully
  placed on the bags

    two paddles were crossed amidship of
  the canoe and bending over pierre
  brought it up until it rested upon his
  knees and then with a slight effort
  lifted it upon his shoulders a small
  tump-line fastened to the cross-bars was
  fitted upon his head well forward part-
  ly on the forehead

    with the left hand he steadied the
  canoe and with the right picked up the
  gun and whistling to his dog began the
  journey over the faint trail of the portage

    it first led him up a sharp hill cov-
  ered with stones and of uncertain foot-
  ing  and then down an incline into a
  swampy bit where his high moccasins
  sank deep into the soft black ooze then
  once more into the woodland where the
  path twisted around great mossy rocks
  and fallen trees

    to the right he could hear the rapids
  hidden by the dense growth of birches
  and alders on the bank the dog was
  busily exploring nooks along the path
  which soon came out upon some burned
  land where the solemn ghosts of great
  trees projected twisted as if in pain
  their gnarled black limbs fantastically
  like strange living forms apparently sor-
  rowing in the bleak solitude over the
  graveyard of the once hale forest

     but the brule was soon passed the tall
  green growth again reached and a
  glimpse of dark placid water showed
  ahead




the railroad mans magazine

  suddenly from up the stream there
was the loud crash of a gun reverber-
ating among the surrounding hills and
after a brief interval a loud shrill cry
of distress

  it was a womans voice and pierre
throwing the canoe into the bushes along
the path ran on still carrying his gun
leaping over fallen mossy trunks sinking
in black ooze tearing through the drip-
ping bushes that met over the portage

  he dashed out of the woods upon a
sandy point jutting out into the river
perhaps a hundred yards above where
the water began to boil and saw that a
woman was being carried down the
stream toward the boulder-strewn white
torrent in its rush toward the falls
once or twice her head sank under the
swift water as she lifted up her arms

  one glance farther up before he
leaped in the river showed him a great
bull moose that was struggling amid the
wreckage of a canoe with which the
mighty beast seemed to be inextricably
mixed up

  pierre was seized at once by the strong
current with all the strength he had he
swam toward the passing woman his
fierce strokes soon brought him to her
and her long black hair met his grasp

  then came the fight for two lives and
there was a lust in it a fierce develop-
ment of a passion of struggle such as
seizes strong men in the hour of strife

  inch by inch he neared the shore foot
by foot the white water drew him toward
the rapids it tore at him and clung to
him and pulled savagely and struggled
for the possession of his burden as
though maddened with a longing for the
blood of men

  he sank several times and emerged
gasping yet always battling fiercely
when one of his knees struck the bottom
his breath had become a hoarse gurgling
and his strength was ebbing away far-
ther on in the more shallow water he
managed to regain his feet and the
weight of the woman whom he had taken
in one of his arms helped to steady him
while the water boiled around his legs
as if seeking to tear him away

  thus he made his way to the shore
now bearing the burden easily in the ex-
ultation of a fight that was won

  when he reached the sand-bar he de-

posited the half-drowned creature on the
sand and it was only then that he per-
ceived another human form lying pros-
trate upon the rocks higher up the river
and partly submerged

  the moose was still there struggling
and he rushed to the place where he had
thrown down his gun tore off the cover
and at the crashing of the smokeless
cartridge the great animal dropped heav-
ily among the torn birch strips and
broken cedar ribs of the canoe

  running up he found an old indian
who had partly dragged himself out of
the water upon the rocks as he pulled
him out he noticed that one of the legs
was twisted in an unnatural position
and the old fellow groaned with pain

  as he seemed to be breathing natural-
ly pierre placed him with the head and
shoulders resting upon a fallen tree-
trunk and ran back to the woman

  she had partly raised herself lying
upon one hip with her hands resting
upon the sand before her breathing with
difficulty she looked up as pierre bent
over her and spat a mouthful of blood
before speaking

   is he dead  she asked in her famil-
iar french

  in french he reassured her telling her
the man was living but adding that he
looked very ill

  as he knelt by her she stared at him

   the manitou-ilno told of the white
man she said seeming tospeak to her-
self  and there is the little yellow ad-
hom as she saw the terrier who in
great excitement was attempting to ca-
ress his master

  she made an effort to get on her feet

   let me carry you he said

  she shook her head and arose pain-
fully and slowly with his help hold-
ing her hand to her right side and biting
her lip with pierres arm under hers she
began to walk toward the old man in
silence her short gasping breathing
painful to hear they reached the fallen
tree and she attempted to kneel by the
prostrate form  but her strength was ex-
hausted and she collapsed by its side

  pier long black hair bedraggled and
full of sand partly fell over a dark face
of pure indian type she wore a mans
coat and a long skirt of some cheap
woolen material on her feet were the
a heart of the north



high boots of the savage she seemed
slight of build and of middle size
pierre thought her age must be about
eighteen

  the old man was grizzled and bent
and bore themarks of a hard life a
trapper of the old days before there were
sheet-iron stoves provisions and goodly
advances from the fur posts he had
known the meaning of hunger and of
biting cold the peril of blizzards and
storms on great lakes now he seemed
to be broken and apparently nearing the
time of farewell to the toil of living

  matters had to be straightened out as
soon as possible and for the next hour
pierre worked like a beaver neither of
the indians appeared able to speak and
he decided that in order to do any good
he would have to get his supplies

  going to the shore where the moose
lay dead he found that one leg of the
great animal had gone through the bot-
tom of the canoe that had clung to him
by the spring of the cedar ribs

  a great jagged wound in the paunch
showed the indians shot while a smaller
one just back of the foreshoulder marked
his own one or two bundles that had
been placed under the cross-pieces were
still in the canoe and he dragged out a
tent that had been wrapped around a
small sheet-iron stove and some blankets
with a bundle of traps

  everything else had evidently fallen
into the river and been washed away
down the rapids and over the falls or
was being ground to pieces upon the
rocky bottom

  he then ran down the portage hin-
dered by his wet clothes and returned
bearing two of his bags with the tump-
line passed over his forehead

  the first thing to do was to start the
kettle boiling and then he covered the
indians with his own warm blankets
hanging their own to dry he managed
to make them swallow some strong tea
and then returned for the rest of his
things leaving his canoe where he had
thrown it on his return he found that
paddy had remained near the girl and
was licking her hand with the nursing
instinct so strongly developed in some
dogs

  taking the ax pierre quickly chopped
down some saplings for pegs and tent-

poles and soon had the indians tent set
up once more he went into the woods
and returned with a great load of bal-
sam-boughs neatly packed  the handle
of his ax and proceeded to make a good
bed

  the old man was groaning at times in
a low resigned manner lie was given
another drink of tea and the young man
then decided that the injured leg mfist be
treated

  he slit down the high moccasin which
was nearly full of blood and then cut
through the heavy woolen stocking and
saw to his dismay a sharp piece of bone
protruding through an ugly wound over
the shin this he washed with water
boiled in the kettle

  pulling hard upon the foot caused the
bone to return within the cut which he
covered with a linen handkerchief which
he wrung out of the boiling water then
after much cogitation the whole leg was
bound up with ingenious splints in which
the broken blade of a paddle some bireh-
bark and strips torn from a blanket
played a prominent part

  during all these manipulations the old
man had given some signs of suffering
but generally seemed to be apathetic as
if under the influence of great shock
and as pierre carefully lifted him and
bore him to the tent the poor old body
was very limp it took a few minutes to
remove his vtet clothes and the young
man wrapped him in blankets then he
turned to the girl

   let me carry you to the tent he
said  you are shivering in this cold
wind

  but she refused again to let him help
and rose with difficulty in pain she
pressed both hands to her right side and
entered the tent she glanced at the old
man now resting quietly and looked at
pierre with a shy expression of gratitude

   it is good she said  thanks

   now let me see what the matter is
with your chest he suggested after she
had lain down

  but she waved him away impatiently
her cheeks flushing red and he had to
speak authoritatively declaring that he
was a doctor this was not quite true
for he had only a few years before at-
tended one course in medicine at laval
university


the railroad mans magazine

  he was sprung from masterful people
however and finally gained his way the
girl faintly defending herself as he pro-
ceeded to remove some of her dripping
clothes

  it took him but a short time to decide
that at least two ribs were broken

  he went out of the tent and began to
dig in one of his bags from which he
pulled out a little box in which some
things intended for use in case of emer-
gencies were kept and took a roll of ad-
hesive-pl aster

  he used it nearly all in a fairly cor-
rect manner dressing her hurts so that
the movements of the injured side might
be well restrained

  but during this time with her chest
nearly bare and a red flush upon her
dusky cheeks the girl obedient yet full
of revolt her modesty outraged feeling
that she was forced to submit suffering
while realizing that good was being done
looked at him with great dark eyes in
which surprise pain and resignation
were all shown

  but pierre did not look at her he
was busy and to him she was but a suf-
fering thing whose misery he must re-
lieve as soon as possible

  he finished his work and brought out
a heavy flannel shirt which he passed
over her head and put on her and then
his own coat

   try and take off that wet skirt he
said  and wrap yourself in the blanket
youre shivering now i must go and look
after that moose

  he went down to the shore where the
dead animal was lying partly in the wa-
ter which made it easier for him to turn
it while skinning as it was nearly afloat

  he first went to work to remove the
head for preserving thinking he might be
able to take it back with him for the taxi-
dermist then the antlers were very
good and he estimated that they were
well over fifty inches wide in about a
quarter of an hour he gave the last stroke
that severed the head from the spine
the really important thing was to save
as much of the meat as possible while
he labored with sheath-knife and ax he
pondered over the situation

  chance had thrown under his care two
poor devils neither of whom might prob-
ably be able to travel for a long time

their provisions had evidently all been
lost when the canoe capsized without
his aid they would certainly have been ha
an awful predicament badly hurt with
their canoe staved in beyond repair food
all gone and their gun at the bottom of
the river

  the girl did not seem lo be in a very
bad condition-she was such a sturdy-
looking little  savage notwithstanding
her apparent slenderness he had no-
ticed that the muscles of her arms and
shoulders were those of an athlete-grace-
ful and strong but then this spitting
of blood was annoying could consump-
tion as with so many of her doomed race
have spread its grasping claws upon her 

  with his fragmentary medical knowl-
edge he managed to recollect that it
might point to an injury of the lung
caused by the sharp edge of one of the
broken ribs this worried him a good
deal but not as much as the state in
which the old indian was he had very
grave doubts about that case compound
fractures were bad enough in themselves
but the man was so weak so prostrated
that surely he must be suffering from
some grave internal injury

  as far as pierre could see the problem
before him was to look after them until
they could be left alone-to supply them
with provisions and get back to lake
st john as soon as possible and send
them help

  now it seemed frightfully far away
from the mouth of the river to tschota-
gama there were fifty miles then over
two hundred more to where the peribonca
divided into the shipsliaw and manouan
rivers

  it was several days travel up the
former - a wild rough stream hardly
ever used by the indians since the ma-
nouan was the direct and easy road to
the grand lac manouan above which
were the great trapping-grounds the
matter of provisions was the hardest to
solve and the moose he was now cutting
up would have to be their chief source of
supply

  if the girl grew worse instead of bet-
ter the problem could hardly be solved
he could not expect to meet any parties
of indians even after reaching the forks
of the river the trappers who winter in
the upper reaches of the peribonca had
a heart of the north



all gone up several weeks before he had
been informed and the great river would
be deserted

   all he could do now was to cure moose
meat and smoke fish for them to assure
their subsistence until assistance could be
procured his own supplies had been
calculated to last eight weeks of which
four were nearly gone but with care they
would help a good deal

   so he hacked away at the great carcass
most of the time up to his knees in water
and hung great lumps of meat on a pole
under which a poky fire was lighted to
save them from the attacks of meat-flies
toiling as never before for the first time
during his trip he regretted the impa-
tience that had caused him to take this
tong journey without guides after he
he had finished cutting up the moose he
divided the great pieces in smaller strips
and built a staging of branches upon
which they were placed over a great
boucane

  grimy and wet and smeared with
blood and soiled with the rotten wood
he kept gathering for his smoke he la-
bored on scarcely feeling any fatigue
knowing that he was now fighting for
lives and that all that had occurred be-
fore had been tantamount to play

   several hours passed thus interrupted
by frequent visits to the tent and it was
nearly dark before he decided to stop
work having packed most of the meat
in one of his big water-proof bags he
intended to take it out and smoke it again
on the morrow it would be mighty poor
food from a civilized standpoint but
would serve well to sustain life

   he went up to the tent again glad to
put his hands in his pockets and to suck
away at his pipe for he felt weary

  how is everything he asked

  the old man hardly seemed to notice
him a queer vague smile crept over
his features and one of the hands moved
uncertainly then he relapsed into the
state of indifference which to the young
man seemed ominous the girl with a
certain shy sullenness said she thought
her father was very ill

    i hope he will get over it he an-
swered  he is very old and it will
take a long time before he is better but
how are you feeling now  how is the
pain in your side

  the energy of her youth and the im-
passivity of iier race did not permit her
to acknowledge how much she suffered
she said she was all right but her quick
catchy breathing and the expression she
could not conceal belied her words she
seemed to be lying in an uncomfortable
position and pierre knelt by her gently
raising her head and adjusted the fir-
bouglis with a deft hand she had thrown
some of her wet clothing upon the ground
and he took it up and hung it to the ridge-
pole to dry

  supper -was the next thing to be at-
tended to and the teakettle was soon
hanging over the brisk little fire pieces
of moose meat were boiling away in the
cooking-pot and he fried some slices of
bacon

  the dog looked on these proceedings
with much interest licking his chops and
eying his master patiently wagging his
stumpy tail and whining from time to
time a search of the provision-bags re-
vealed a good part of a loaf of bread
which pierre had baked in the sand the
day before

  he was crouching by the fire shading
his face from the heat with one hand
while he held the stick he had fastened
to the handle of the frying-pan the
girl could see him from where she was
lying and she wondered

  she believed all that the priests had
told her at roberval and knew that they
said that the practises of the manitou-il-
nos the sorcerers were sinful and un-
holy  yet they did wonderful things and
one had told of the coming of the white
man and the little yellow addom that had
licked her hand

  who was this strange individual some
of whose clothing was such as gentlemen
wear sometimes in the woods and who
had curious cooking things of a silvery
metal she had never seen before and
speaking like the doctors and the priests
in good french was all alone with his
dog

  she could not make it out it puzzled
her she noticed that when he cut wtjod
he was not very skilful and that the fire
lie had-made was just a little too big to
cook comfortably by he must have had
people do those things for him at other
times like all the gentlemen that came
to that country she noted that he was


the railroad mans magazine

strong and tall and dimly realized that
he had fought like a demon to get her out
of the water he was surely a queer
man with his gentle pleasant voice and
his masterful way of ordering one to do
things and his boyish manner of playing
with the dog

  she sought to rise when he came in
with a dipper of tea but he made her lie
down again with just a motion of his
hand she obeyed and felt bashful at
the idea that a gentleman was waiting on
her she took the hot drink and some
bread and bacon and the young man was
pleased to see that she could eat a little
it was a favorable sign

  he also brought food to the old man-
some tea and a cupful of the strong broth
from the moose meat in which he had
also boiled a little rice from his provision-
bags

  lured by the insatiable indian thirst
for tea the old fellow swallowed some
of the strong infusion and appeared to
relish it but would hardly touch the soup
or any of the other things he tried a
few mouthfuls but shook his head gen-
tly in a discouraged way and relapsed
into an apathetic state

  pierre wondered whether he would like
to smoke and having found the indians
pipe in the pocket of the wet coat he had
removed from him offered him tobacco
the old fellow accepted it and puffed
away when pierre held a lighted match
for him but after a few whiffs the pipe
fell from his mouth unnoticed

   the poor old chap must be mighty
ill thought pierre who like every one
else had never seen a live indian unable
to smoke

  he sat down near them in the tent
while paddy at his feet watched eagerly
for bits thrown at him from time to time
the young man was hungry as a wolf
and attacked his food almost as raven-
ously

  while eating he began to question her

  what is your name  he asked in
french

   ou-memeou she answered  but
no-it is anne marie i was baptized

   what does ou-memeou mean  

   it is the little gray dove not like
wab-memeou the pigeon i am his
daughter and she pointed to the old
man

   you were going back to lac st
jean 

  she nodded affirmatively

  where were you coming from

   from camp far north beyond grand
lac manouan

   why did you come dowm the ship-
shaw instead of the manouan  

  she did not answer at first and fin-
ally said it was nearer to their hunting-
ground but somehow he realized that
she did not want to tell him the real
reason and went on with his questions

   i suppose you drifted down on the
big moose suddenly near the bank and
your father shot quick and he jumped
on you and upset the boat eh

  again she assented with a movement of
her head

   tell me how- long have you been
spitting blood  

  she looked astonished and shook her
head again

   i do not spit blood she asserted

   but this morning 

  yes she answered and averting
her lower lip showed him that it had
been cut and bruised against her fine
white teeth fie felt very glad that his
fears were proyen groundless for it
simplified matters a good deal

  if she was not consumptive and had
received no serious injury to her lungs
she would soon be well again and able
to care for her father he sought to
recollect how long broken ribs might
take to mend but his memory on that
point was hazy and he could only con-
clude that it might take a couple of
weeks or more

  in the semidarkness pierre put up
his own little silk tent close to the
larger one and cut up enough wood to
last over night finding that there was
nothing more that he could do for the
two indians he called the dog that was
lying down near anne marie and made
ready to enjoy a needed rest

  as the terrier snuggled beside him
pierre looked at him by the fitful light
of the camp fire outside the tent as he
had left the flap wide open and spoke
to him

   youve taken a fancy to that little
savage paddy boy

  the dog wagged his tail

  tired though he was paddys master
a heart of the north



tossed about under his blanket for a long
time suddenly with a voice full of
conviction and marked with a certain
bitterness he uttered a sentence which
considering certain fairly recent happen-
ings was not without a certain tincture
of philosophy

   the deuce take women  was his re-
mark

chapter ii

the blood in his veins

t efore falling asleep pierres
thoughts wandered back to lands
still farther north and to that ancestor
of his farquhar ferguson beyond
whom the family knew none of its fore-
bears

  this first ferguson was a dour pres-
byterian who had wandered to canada
in the trail of the fighters who con-
quered the country for england after
some years of hard knocks he married
somewhere north of winnipeg an in-
dian girl who bore him a family of four
and made a good wife to him until he
was blotted out from among men in a
great blizzard

  the inheritence he left consisted in a
couple of guns a fine lot of traps a
tent and the wages due by the hudson
bay company for whom he ran a small
post in the wilderness

  this wealth made the woman a desir-
able person and she succumbed to the
attractions of a warrior of her tribe who
took in her wealth and her family know-
ing that the latter would not long prove
troublesome

  the oldest child was a girl who soon
disappeared with a cree indian but the
other three all sons wandered away
over various trails and the further fate
of one only was known who took to wife
a -white woman of mixed irish and
french - canadian descent his exist-
ence ended at the breaking of a log jam
on the st maurice and his family scat-
tered over the land

  it was known that one of his sons
went to sea and was never heard of
again and that another was concerned in
the riel rebellion and had later disap-
peared after writing once from british
columbia

  two daughters married farmers and
were still living while a third had be-
come a nun the youngest son was
pierres father unlike others of his
family he had had but two children of
whom one died in montreal the year of
the great smallpox epidemic pierre
left an only child became as the apple
of his parents eyes

  the father had returned from a long
journey in the far west with much gold
which he increased and multiplied in
trade for he had the faculty of smelling
out money just as a mink smells musk-
rats or fish

  the young man tried for a profession
medicine was his- first choice but he
gave it up after a year in favor of min-
ing engineering and left this to help
his father in his business ventures for
which he also showed a keen nose from
an aunt on the mothers side he obtained
an inheritance and bought interests in a
pulp-mill and then in a gold mine in
nova scotia which chanced to pay good
dividendsand in a fishing venture of
labrador

  notwithstanding all this he had con-
siderable leisure which he spent with an
instinct that was probably an atavistic
inheritance from the dusky wife of far-
quhar in the woods where he hunted
and fished and enjoyed the sensation of
being drawn toward the north toward
the wild freedom that was to him like a
better purer breath of life

  this particular trip had been taken
for two reasons of which the least was
the fact that he had heard something
about a proposed railroad to james bay
in hudson bay and that it would proba-
bly pass over a certain river

  now this stream fell in the shipshaw
a good days journey above the point
he had reached an old indian who had
traveled there had described to him a
few years before something that must
have been a very mountain of asbestos
it was avorth while looking into since
if the railroad line passed near it it
might acquire great value

  but the chief reason was that he had
met with a disappointment and at the
time felt so hurt and angry that he had
run away to the woods for consolation

  his pride had been wounded for he
was young and no cynic


the railroad mans magazine

   the trouble was all over a young lady

  some days at cacouna and others
during which he followed her to tadou-
sac and idled with her a golden week or
two had sufficed to give him the im-
pression that he was madly in love with
her a florid and somewhat vulgar ma-
ma and a father who considered in the
light of an efficient provider but other-
wise wholly insignificant house-broken
and subject to every whim of his fat
spouse and slender blond daughter did
not affect her charms

  she was certainly attractive and
flirted as she breathed naturally and
efficiently

   as the halcyon days floated by pierre
had become certain that he could not
live without her and that he was going to
propose this is a serious matter to a
youth who means what he says and be-
lieves in the everlastingness of love

   but just before he reached a final de-
cision a white steam-yacht turned up the
st lawrence and anchored at the foot
of the little cliffs at tadousac right at
the beautiful mouth of the saguenay it
bore a splendid-looking youth with much
money and a very fetching manner who
was introduced by mutual friends where-
upon pierre felt himself rather neglected

  this had lasted but a day or two be-
fore pierre feeling that insensibly his
goddess was slipping away from him de-
cided to cut the gordian knot at once
and proposed on the veranda of the
hotel one line moonlit night while the
yachtsman was indoors playing billiards

   in justice to the young lady it should
be said that she had never meant to en-
gage in anything but a most innocent
flirtation with a very pleasant young
man and felt rather sorry for him she
was very gentle and kind in the sweet-
est possible way manifested a sisterly in-
terest in his future welfare and made
him feel perhaps mistakenly that the
steam - yacht or its owner were para-
mount in her thoughts

  men take such happenings in many
ways and pierre suffered from a sense
of humiliation that was at first quite
intolerable he wondered whether
there might be about him something un-
couth a remnant left by the slight ad-
mixture of indian blood in his veins
that made him undesirable as a mate

for so intensely civilized and worldly a
young woman

  it did not take him long to decide
that this was probably not the case and
that he had simply been beaten in a com-
petition for a prize by a man better fit-
ted for that particular contest he did
not dream of the probable truth which
was that miss fanny was really in love
with no one at all and simply sought
to have as good a time as possible

  pierre left on the steamboat for que-
bec told his people he was off for lake
st john and gathered up his camping
things and started on a trip he had
planned a year before

  the journey did him much good
there was comfort in the discovery he
gradually and reluctantly made that he
was not really wounded very deeply in
fact it took but a few days before he
began to feel conscious that the whole
affair might be one of those happenings
that leave behind them a sense of having
made a rather lucky escape

  strong and self-reliant thinking he
knew what he wanted he had been too
busy to become much of a man of the
world and it was with some surprise
that the feeling came that after all the
whole thing might have been a false
alarm the awakening in him of the de-
sire for loving companionship but not a
disaster that could lead to the shatter-
ing of an existence

  for some hours he slept deeply and
then awoke suddenly with every sense
alert as happens to the wild things of
the woodlands and to the men whom the
wilderness has called

  his last dream had mingled with the
sound of voices and in the tent near by
could be heard a low muttering a slow
pouring out of indistinct words that at
rare intervals were interrupted by the
softer voice of the girl

   pierre felt chilly the fire outside the
tent had gone out and one of his blan-
kets had been given to the old man he
rose and decided to make more fire it
was very dark great somber clouds
drifted heavily overhead and tlie noise
of the rapids came in a low booming
sound interrupted from time to time by
the song of the night wind blowing
through the jagged tops of the north-
land trees
a heart of the north



  the flap of the larger tent was opened
and pierre went in in the darkness
nothing could be made out but the two
indistinct forms lying upon the ground
and he spoke in a low voice

  what is the matter is your father
worse

   he began to speak some time ago and
says many things i do not always under-
stand and i fear he is very ill an-
swered the girl

  the young man went back to his tent
and found one -f the few remaining
candles which he brought to the large
tent and lighted

  he knelt by the old man whose eyes
followed the flickering light for a mo-
ment but he soon paid no further heed
to it and began again in a low voice
that seemed to reflect all the sadness of
the wilderness to mutter things that
were unintelligible topierre

  what is he saying he asked

  the girl listened for a moment and
said with accents that had tears in
them

   he says that the month of the fall-
ing leaves uasteshiau pushum is com-
ing and we must not stay long here he
says the morning will be here soon and
i must boil gum and seal oil to mend the
canoe also- he says he feels a sick-
ness and is not well and will not be
able to carry a heavy pack to-day and
we mjist start early

  pierre lifted the candle until the
light fell upon the girls face the lids
were not quivering over the great dark
eyes and all the features were calm
but great tears were coursing down her
cheeks and she was stricken hard and
bearing it like a brave strong soul

  he felt that her sorrow was touching
and that her heart was speaking the
things which she could not have put in
words

  looking again at the old man he was
shocked to see how great a change had
occurred within a short time the mut-
tered words issuing from his lips came
faintly yet witih a certain quiet con-
fident expression that showed how far
away he was wandering through bygone
events of a long hard life and stumb-
ling through a mental darkness that
was mercifully hiding from him the
nearing end

  placing his hand upon the old mans
forehead which he expected to find
warm it was a surprise to feel it very
cold and clammy

  remembering a pint flask of brandy
at the bottom of one of his packs and
thinking it might prove useful he
dragged the heavy bag within the tent
and gave the candle to anne marie to
hold while he rummaged until he found
what he wanted

  pouring some of the liquor in a tin
cup he lifted the old mans head gently
and bade him drink the sufferer did
not seem to understand at first but fin-
ally pierre made him swallow it

  under the influence of the strong
draft the old indian seemed to revive a
little he looked at pierre and then at
his daughter shaking his head gently
their faces were illumined by the can-
dlelight and he appeared to consider
them with some surprise but the vacant
look soon returned and giving a long
sigh his head sank down once more and
he appeared to fall quietly asleep

  anne marie looked at pierre with shy
gratitude surely this must be a good
man who was so gentle with her old
father and she wondered again what he
might be and how he chanced to be
alone so far up the great river

  in some way pierre realized that the
girl would not sleep and felt so thor-
oughly awakened that he did not think
it best to lie down again pie lit his
pipe and sat down beside her in silence
havingblown out the valuable candle
but the chill of the night struck through
him and brought a shiver

  the little cast-iron stove he had ta-
ken from the wrecked canoe was near
with several lengths of stovepipe packed
within it and in a few moments it was
rigged up in the tent after bringing in
an armful of wood a good fire was soon
roaring and it was pleasant to see the
little flashes of red light showing through
the cracks

  he rapped his pipe on the heel of his
boot put it again in his pocket and sat
down on his bag near the girl

  how long have you been awake
he asked

   a long time i think i have not
slept she answered

   much pain 


the railroad mans magazine

   some pain not very much but am
afraid i am much afraid

  she shook her head and looked in the
direction of her father pierre tried to
reassure her but somehow words of com-
fort would not come the fact could not
be hidden that he also feared that the old
mans life was fast ebbing away it was
hardly possible to deceive her and the few
things he managed to say were unable to
bring any change in the tense look of her
eyes

   you must try to sleep he advised

  but she shook her head and he did not
insist and they remained in silence with-
in the tent listening to the occasional
words spoken by the old man who had
fallen asleep but frequently seemed to
be dreaming aloud

  from time to time pierre opened the
little stove to put in more wood and a
red glare would become disseminated
throughout the tent to die out abruptly
when the door was closed

  without there was the great silence of
the wilderness that is always accentuated
by little interruptions the familiar
sounds of the nighf life that never ceases
to pulsate recurred at intervals the
splashes of fish leaping on the water the
intermittent distant hoots of a great
horned owl the rising and dying of the
breeze the ill-defined scratching sounds
on the gravel and sand of the tiny beach
where muskrats were at play

  all these whenever they ceased seemed
to render yet more profound the great
stillness that like some weird cover
wrapped the world up in its folds

  within the tent there was but the sound
of the old mans breathing and of his
occasional words uttered in a very low
voice full of an inexpressible patience
and sadness as of one who bore quietly
some great ill inseparable from the hard
life of the dwellers in the waste places

  some hours passed thus and the girl
felt comforted by the presence of the
young man with the blind trust she was
beginning to repose in him as a white man
possessed of all manner of knowledge that
was hidden from her she felt as if he
might by the mere fact of being there
prevent the dreadful calamity she feared

  was he not of the same race as the
oblate fathers who had taught her to
read as the nuns whose very dress seemed

redolent of mysterious things as the doc-
tors that had power over death and evil
as the rich men who owned the sawmills
and the great hotel  what might he not
accomplish 

  pierre rose several limes during the
long vigil once or twice he gave the old
man another sip from the flask and re-
plenished the little stove that burned the
wood up very fast but when the first
faint light began to be distinct even
through the canvas of the tent and while
still sitting up with knees drawn up to
his chin that was resting upon his folded
hands he fell asleep and remained in
that position for a long time until the
sunlight showed high above the serrated
edge of the woods in the east

  when he awoke with a start the fire in
the little stove had burned itself out and
rhe girl was still watching lying upon
her injured side her keen eyes resting
upon the old man who still seemed to
sleep quietly under the blankets

  are you cold asked pierre i
have slept why did you not awaken me

  she shook her head vaguely and pierre
saw that all her thoughts were for her
father he did not know that as long as
he was there the girl was satisfied since
she could call him in case of need and
that she would not have awakened him
otherwise  for the sleep of a man in camp
as on shipboard is a sacred thing not to
be interrupted except for good cause

  pierre rose with a yawn but in a few
moments was very wide-awake and
splashing mightily in the water by the
shore with a cake of soap and a towel ly-
ing upon the bottom of his upturned
canoe his shirt-collar drawn down and
opened exposing part of his great chest
the sleeves of his flannel shirt were pulled
up as far as they would go leaving his
white sinewy arms showing in contrast
to the brown face and hands he was scrub-
bing hard

  this over he took up the ax and go-
ing a little way back in the wood began
to smite lustily and soon had enough logs
for a good fire outside of the big tent
upon which he put the kettle to boil
hanging from a stick driven slanting into
the ground

  what do you think you could eat
he called to the girl who was watching
him from the tent
a heart of the north



   i am not very hungry she replied
 if you would let me i might be able
to cook for you it is the womans place

    you just keep still until i let you get
up he answered cheerily  im the cook
and everything else until your ribs get
mended

  he took great interest in the breakfast
which would be later than usual owing
to that last nap and often spoke to the
dog who was looking on wistfully and
whining with impatience while his mas-
ter was sitting upon a big log holding
the long stick he had stuck in the hollow
handle of the sputtering frying-pan

  look at the dog suddenly ex-
claimed the girl upon whose face a
strange look of fear had come

  paddys hair was bristling and he ut-
tered a low growl as he dashed along the
faintly marked path that led over the
portage

  he stopped as a tall man made his ap-
pearance the man was loaded with a
heavy pack and walked carefully over
the rocks the great muscles at the sides
of his neck bulging with the pull of the
tump - line that held up two hundred-
pound bags of flour both hands were up
over his shoulders grasping the straps
and relieving a bit the drag upon his neck

  with the slightest possible motion of
his head in pierres direction he kept on
toward the landing-place where he put
down his bags with an action of relief and
quietly pulled out his pipe for a smoke
while swiftly observing the wreck of the
canoe the marks of the moose-skinning
and the scaffolding erected for smoking
the meat

  then he slowly came up to the camp-
fire addressing pierre who had left his
seat in the tent and stood before it with
the customary salute of the montagnais

chapter iii

the girl sees a fight

tjierre repeated the greeting at the
same time handing a plug of to-
bacco to the newcomer who pulled his
slieath-knife from his belt and proceeded
to cut a pipeful

  this done the man held a bit of birch-
bark to the fire and got a light squatting

 the long end of the backlog after re-
turning the plug his complexion showed
him to be a metis a half-breed he
was a man of great size and strength with
a low forehead and a taciturn sullen ex-
pression

   nothing was said for a long time while
pierre went on with his cooking and the
newcomer took note of the surroundings
the flap of the big tent was down and he
could not see its interior but the wreck
of the canoe the various articles scattered
around one or two familiar spots upon
the tent taught him a great deal and
finally he grunted inquisitively in
f rench

  old michel

   pierre only then recollected that he had
not asked the old mans name but an-
swered that an old indian was within the
tent and that he did not know whether
or not he was called michel

  the half-breed looked at him suspi-
ciously and spoke again

  anne marie

   yes answered pierre  anne
marie and her old father they have
both been badly hurt

  he went on unbidden to give a brief
account of the happenings of the day be-
fore to which the half-breed listened in
silence only grunting once or twice dur-
ing the recital

  finally rising and pulling aside the
tent flap the half-breed went in and
pierre felt that a big load had been taken
off his shoulders for the newcomer evi-
dently knew these people and would
probably be able to help him out

  there was  doubt that he would be
willing to remain there while the pro-
jected visit to the asbestos-mine was ac-
complished a matter of but few days

  then pierre could take the girl back
to lake st john or better still the half-
breed could be hired to do it there was
also a possibility that anne marie might
have friends or relatives trapping some-
where in the north and that she might
elect to go there the old man unfor-
tunately played no part in these plans for
it was too evident that his journey was
nearly ended

   pierres reflections were interrupted by
an exclamation from anne marie and he
put down his frying-pan to find out what
was the matter


the railroad mans magazine

  he was surprised to hear her talking
excitedly and angrily while the old man
paid no heed to what was going on around
him the external world seemed to have
disappeared from his ken as with slow
nearly rhythmical motions he kept  on
picking at the blanket that covered him

  the features in the brighter light of
the morning showed an even more drawn
and pinched expression than on the day
before

  the half-breed was listening to the girl
with a careless contemptuous expression
and now and then grunted some reply in
the montagnais dialect paddy began to
bark again and pierre looked out of the
tent

  down the path another man was com-
ing bearing a canoe poised on his head
with the tump-line while in one hand he
carried a goodly bundle of traps like
the half-breed he went on to the landing-
place and rid himself of his load with a
grunt of satisfaction before coming up to
the tent from his darker skin and pure
indian features he was probably a mon-
tagnais or perhaps a tste de boue  he
nodded to pierre and looked in the tent
saying something in his indian speech

  anne marie uttered a low moan

   what the deuce are they bothering
that girl about pierre asked himself
impatiently lie had taken an instinctive
dislike to the two men especially the
first and entering the tent which began
to be rather crowded inquired what was
the matter

  at first the girl did not answer she
had partly risen in a sitting position
and was looking steadily at -her old
father who was still monotonously pick-
ing away at the blanket interrupting this
now and then with slow rotations of his
head the eyes seeming to follow flying
things visible to him alone

   this man the savage she finally
answered without looking up at him
 says that he once saw an old man who
did these things just like my father and
he lived but a very short time she
crossed herself and spoke again  i fear
much it is a sign of death

  pierres head bent down and he made
no reply for he had during the long
night decided that the end must be very
near going out to look after his cook-
ing he again held the frying-pan over

the fire for a few moments and then
poured out some tea which he brought
to the girl with food on one of his alumi-
num plates

  he felt that he must ask the others
whether they would eat thy had un-
doubtedly broken their fast earlier in the
morning but indian-like would forego
no opportunity to feed the three sat
down outside the tent and consumed vast
quantities of tea with flapjacks and fried
pork

  pierre had meant to speak to them
about such arrangements as could be
made to care for the girl but instinctive-
ly felt that something was wrong that
their presence was distasteful tb her and
he decided to consult with her first as
soon as opportunity allowed

  the fact was clear that the half-breed
was an obnoxious individual anne
marie had spoken angrily and he felt
that he was cultivating an intense dislike
to him

  the indian was but an ordinary speci-
men of his race strong short of stature
with an impassive countenance from
which nothing particular could be made
out

  after they saw that there was nothing
more to eat the two men rose said they
were going back over the portage for the
remainder of their things and soon de-
parted pulling away at their pipes and
swinging their tump-lines in their hands
while paddy sniffed at their heels sus-
piciously

  as soon as they had disappeared
pierre went to the tent he wanted an
explanation and it was soon forthcom-
ing

   come quick  anne marie ex-
claimed as soon as she saw him  have
they gone 

  she was standing on her cheeks
there burned dusky red spots and her
black eyes were flashing she seemed to
be in a passion of excitement and was
trying to subdue it the hand that was
not pressed against her injured side was
clenched tightly and moved tremulously

  what are you going to do she
asked eagerly  are you going to leave
now

   well im sure i dont know he re-
plied  i had thought of giving them
money to take you back to lac st jean
a heart of the north



or- perhaps you would like to go north
again with them where are they going
now  

   back to the place we came from  
she replied quickly  but i wont go
with them either to the south or to the
north i hate them the half - breed
wants me for his wife i would kill him
first and if i could not do that  would
rather kill myself 

  she had grown still more excited as
she was speaking her lips were trem-
bling

  pierre placed his hand gently on her
shoulder

   lie down again anne marie he
said  you may injure yourself with all
that excitement you shall do just as
you please if you wont go with them
there is plenty of room in my canoe and
i will take you back to lac st tean
after-

  he interrupted himself suddenly but
she took up his words

   after my poor old father is dead
yes i know he cannot live i will go
back with you if you will be so good-
but how can i  the half-breed will not
let me

   i dont see how he can prevent you
exclaimed pierre  you say he wants

to be c

to marry you and that you hate him
he cant marry you against your will
do you mean that theres going to be a
fight

  the young man was beginning to feel
rather belligerent he disliked the half-
breeds looks and sympathized with the
girls feelings sufficiently to make him
ready to take her part

  a fight she exclaimed yes he
would fight but he would rather do some
treacherous thing i dont know what
he will do

  exhausted by the excitement the girl
sank down again upon the blanket under
which she had been lying and looked at
pierre as if hoping that he could suggest
some way out of the trouble he stood
there wondering what kind of a mess he
was getting into

   tell me all about it he suggested
 i cant help you until i know what the
row is about	

   yes i will tell you sit down just
outside the tent so that you may watch
the portage and see when they return
he is very suspicious he must not see
us talking too much i am afraid he will
do you harm he will do nothing while
my old father is living but afterward-
who knows

a new freight
giant

the heaviest and most powerful loco-
motive of its type for use on
the santa fe	-s

the baldwin locomotive works recently sup-
plied the atchison topeka and santa fe rail-
way with two passenger and two freight locomotives
which are the heaviest engines thus far built for their
respective classes of service while differing greatly
in their proportions the two designs are alike in
principle and have many features in common

   the engines belong to what is known as the mallet
articulated type first introduced abroad in the year
 by m anatole mallet a noted french engineer
in the mallet locomotive the driving-wheels are
divided into two groups and there are four cylin-
ders two of- which drive the rear group of wheels
while the remaining two drive the forward group
the cylinders are arranged on the compound sys-
tem  that is the steam is first used in the rear or
high-pressure cylinders and is then passed through
the front or low-pressure cylinders after which it
escapes up the stack in the usual manner

  this arrangement provides a locomotive with a
large amount of weight on the driving-wheels but
the wheel-base or distance between the front and
back wheels is necessarily jong therefore to en-
able the locomotive to traverse curves easily the
front frames are pivoted to the rear frames

   tlie forward group of wheels is thus able to swing
laterally and the engine traverses sharp curves as
easily as a locomotive of the ordinary type

  locomotive no  shown in the illustration
has driving-wheels  inches in diameter and weighs
without its tender  pounds this is the
heaviest engine thus far built for any railway and
its total  weight including the tender is approxi-
mately  tons

  the tenders of both locomotives are similar and
are of exceptional size each is carried on two six-
wheeled trucks and has capacity for  gallons
of water and  gallons of fuel-oil

  the boiler is  feet in diameter works under a
pressure of  pounds and has a total heating sur-
face including the feed-water heater of  square
feet there are also  square feet of superheat-
ing and reheating surface

  there are two high-pressure cylinders  inches
in diameter by -inch stroke connected to eight
coupled drivers  inches in diameter and two low-
pressure cylinders  inches in diameter by -inch
stroke connected to eight coupled -inch drivers
the pull on the draw-bar maximum power is  tons

   it is  exaggeration to say that these locomo-
tives mark a new era in american locomotive prac-
tise and we beg the reader to turn to the article
 progress in locomotive building in this issue
in which this great subject is treated at length

      
 the stolen ten thousand

by d c freeman

               what happened on the night that denver
               joe made a haul in no  the hoodoo

of the despatchers office at
the barns came shorty saun-
ders looking so sour that
they all smiled at him half
a dozen of the boys who were
just taking out their cars for
the rush hours greeted shorty with vary-
ing expressions of cheer he had just
been removed from the waiting-list fol-
lowing a long enforced lay-off imposed
by the superintendent for a slip of duty

    well shorty they cried  youre
 on again off again eh  whats the
luck guess you wont be getting any
more  oversleeps  for a while

  shorty glumly shook his head  that
chumps sure got it in for me he burst
out  hes given me the hoodoo for the
owl hours on thirteenth street i call
that tough on a man whos had to stand a
lay-off and the kid and the missus both
sick

   oh well shorty you know the best
of men have to go on the carpet now and
then did they hand you a hard bunch  
 so-so old man said i took too many
chances i told him as they hadnt put
air-brakes on  the okl hoodoo would
get into a smash-up that would cost some-
thing before they threw her out hanged
old trap i wish shed go over the bridge

into the river some night you wouldnt
see me on her if it wasnt a case of hav-
ing to

   peters and williams started to pull out
 so long they cried at the doleful mo-
torman  keep an extra bucket of sand
aboard and watch her on the crossings-
maybe she wont be your funeral yet

  car  was in bad repute with all em-
ployees of the c and s every man in
the service was familiar with her seeming
inanimate devilishness and they strongly
disliked to have anything to do with her

  the feeling was shared from bozzon
the big boer boss of the barns up to the
office of general manager phillips her
career was marked by pranks-destruc-
tive expensive and unaccountable in the
office of the general manager the offenses
of the  queered  car had brought things
to such a pass that whenever  appeared
in the reports it meant a wreck

  her reputation for mishaps and for
hurting her motormen and conductors
too dated back to the days of the single-
truckers and the old rheostat with the
passing of the bobtails came the exten-
sion of the urban lines fifteen miles into
the country and  was one of the first
double-truckers but there always seemed
to be some misfit about her



which one of us is the guilty party


the railroad mans magazine

  she celebrated her initial run on the
new double-tracked balloon route by
bumping into a damage suit in which the
company was bumped for seven thousand
dollars the complainant was a pedler
of sauerkraut and home-made vinegar
pity for whose condition and calling and
racked constitution led the jury to render
a verdict which jarred the company con-
siderably

  in that instance the motor controller
got stuck and could not be shut off in
time to prevent the collision

  with all her misfortunes  bore a
charmed existence even passing through a
big fire practically unscathed while many
modern new cars were destroyed

   i n the press of business and shortage of
cars  had to be brought out for extra
duty

  one friday-it was the thirteenth day
of june- unaccountably got the bit in
her teeth and ran away with a new motor-
man she dashed down the steep grade erf
sycamore street like an arrow from a bow

   at the foot of the hill there was a sharp
curve a block straight beyond this curve
and below a forty-foot embankment rip-
ples the river car  cut a swath
through widow maloneys garden de-
molished the fences and-stopped on the
very edge of the bank amid a shower
of dirt broken glass and twisty splinters

  chris knudson a giant in stature held
the brakes until the brass handle was bent
he was the last man taken out powerless
to utter a word and fit after that for only
flagmans duty

  after that  went into retirement but
when the demand for cars was strong
again forth came she in fresh paint and
with the marks of her last trouble cov-
ered up they did not think however to
change the number

  the repairers readjusted the trucks and
installed a motor that would roll her along
at eighteen miles an hour she toted her
thirty dollars a days worth of human
traffic for a month then she left the
track and destroyed popcorn jimmys lit-
tle mint near the ball-park for which the
company paid roundly

  john nancy was sent out with  and
a trailer with a picnic crowd and the hoo-
doo scared a hundred people into teetotal-
ism on the way home bv trying to peal
through the span braces of the bridge

nancy declared his ultimatum he had
worked a controller for fifteen years and
he said if he was ordered out with 
again hed quit the service and go to
ranching it

  shorty saunders wished from the bot-
tom of his heart that he could likewise
have asserted his independence but he
could not through no particular fault
of his own he had been in some little
trouble  he had had to suffer the penalty
of a long lay-off while at home there was
an instalment indebtedness doubling up
on him and the missus and the kid both
sick for a time

  shorty felt that skinner should have
given him a decent run along with the
other old men of the service shorty was
ambitious and wished to rise to the dig-
nity of a place upon one of the elegant
new coaches of pullman pattern with a
long run automatic brakes compressed-
air-whistling apparatus and everything
else to make the life of the man on the
front end ideal	

  life on the vestibuled suburban ap-
peared to shorty to be one unalloyed
dream of delight there was better pay
in it overtime was profitable and there
was less danger of collision than in the
down-town district to be set back
twisting the old-fashioned ratchet-brake
on a dead little cross-town stub branch
was heart-breaking

  although saunders remonstrated gen-
tly to superintendent skinner and repre-
sented that he was entitled to better de-
serts having served three years the super
was not impressed

    youve got no kick the cold-blood-
ed skinner growled  weve given you
a nine-hour run and its dead easy i
cant give everybody a new car i want
to see if you can keep  on the track un-
til we can get  out of the shops then
ill see take the run or leave it the
waiting-lists full

  ambey bennet head of the bennet
lumbering company of bridal veil
falls fidgeted in the smoking-car of an
incoming train he was enduring a bad
case of nerves

   mr bennets irritation had been at the
boiling-point for hours the up-country
the stolen ten thousand



express which should reach the city at
 in the afternoon was behind time
although he had a journey of less than
fifty miles to make on that train on that
saturday afternoon great odds depended
upon his being on time

  accordingly as bennet was more than
anxious for a wind-up of the negotiations
he drew twelve thousand dollars from the
office and decided he would personally
bring the funds to the city he did not
relish the task of carrying this sum with

handle was bent

him  but as he would reach the city in
broad daylight on the afternoon express
and as he would be  the train a matter
of fifty-five minutes lie reasoned that
there were few chances to take

late trains invariably get to be later
before they arrive mr bennet fumed
abuse upon the railway company as time
wore  and the hour of his appointment
slipped by

  ten thousand dollars of the sum he
carried was wrapped up in a neat com-
pact package of fresh currency enclosed
in a leather case by rubber bands it
reposed in a secret pocket of mr ben-
nets light top-coat

  the union depot steeple clock showed

chris knudsonheld the
brakes until the brass

  a big timber deal which had been
pending for fully a year had only that
day been brought to a head flegel the
companys counsel had rounded up a
bunch of squatters and had shrewdly per-
suaded them to relinquish title in favor of
the syndicate upon a cash basis that
the claimants might not have time to re-
consider the bargain the lawyer had
sent a hurry wire to bennet to come in
from the mills with the cash


the railroad mans magazine

close to six when the train rolled into the
terminal yards the lumber syndicate
president irritably answered the remarks
of the conductor as he was preparing to
leave the car he pulled from his pocket
a yellow slip of paper and read several
times the lawyers message must have
the cash by half past four to-day

at the same instant that mr bennet
read the single line a pair of lynx eyes

to assure himself it was there pushed his
way more aggressively than the rest

  denver joe was close upon him in the
crush the crook was shoved plumb against
the hurrying magnate wwjse coat became
unfastened as they jostled along-ben-
net being too preoccupied to take note-
one lapel was deftly jerked aside and
denver joe located the treasure his in-
stincts told him was there

just behind him took in the words the
inquisitive optics belonged to a low-
browed young man with villainous phys-
iognomy

  the uncautious bennet never dreamed
that an accomplished pickpocket and
house-breaker was a fellow passenger in
the smoking-compartment

  denver joes lynx eyes took in the pos-
sible meaning of the yellow slip of paper
of the prosperous-looking party before
him all his  professional instincts 
were at once aroused he soon made up
his mind that the old gentleman was nerv-
ous about the  cash  mentioned in the
despatch

  scarcely had mr bennet reached the
door of the coach before the denver crook
had located the exact whereabouts of the
money

  through the corridors of the station
two buffeting streams of passengers
flowed aggressively along mr bennet
pressing his precious package to his breast

  they emerged upon the plaza as his
besetting luck would have it not one un-
engaged cab was in sight and bennet
cursed

  just then car  on her way down-town
from the barns to take her thirteenth
street night run with shorty saunders at
the controller and an extra man stopped
at the plaza intersection impatient trav-
elers menacingly shook luggage and um-
brellas at her the crowd clambered
aboard  the conductor rang the gong and
coached them all to move lively

  in the confusion a woman dropped her
purse there was more confusion as the
woman grew excited and as craning necks
and bumping craniums came together in
the general endeavor to assist her den-
ver joe gallantly helped the affrighted
woman his hat was pulled low and his
eves were flashing brightly in the midst
of the general jostling into seats mr
bennet felt somebody butt into him and
turned to murmur  excuse me  to no-
the stolen ten thousand	

body in particular then one lightning
flash of the wrist did the business den-
ver joes hand covered the wallet in an
instant it was transferred from bennets
coat to his sleeve rapidly he moved
forward to place several passengers be-
tween himself and bennet

  the car traversed a block and joe tried
the front door-it was latched from the
motormans side

  if he could slip out by the front plat-
form and drop off-that would be easy
but to get out and away from the car
without attracting general attention by
getting out at that critical juncture-that
was not easy

  saunders noticed some one on the in-
side wanted to leave the car he mo-
tioned  back platform

  then denver joe cast his eyes through
the aisle and estimated his chance of
escape

  a man leaned over and spoke to mr
bennet

  two seconds later the crook noticed
that the lumber magnate passed his hand
into the side-pocket of his coat-the wal-
let was gone

  mr bennet half rose ffom his seat
gasping

  instantly every eye was turned curious-
ly upon him he clutched himself con-
vulsively at various places about his
clothes

   that mans goin to have a polexy
fit shrilly cried a large woman

  immediately everybody drew away from
bennet as if he were stricken with the
plague

  im robbed he shrieked con-
ductor  

  the conductor stoically collected and
rang his fares and looked incredulous
bennet executed a frantic dance in the
aisle and then down on his feet and
hands on the floor of the car he groped
and searched

  the passengers stared at one another
their faces said  which one of us is the
guilty party 

   my moneys gone  bennet shouted
turning red and white  im robbed
within the last two minutes on this car

onductor-

   whats that  robbed are you cer-
tain  

   certain  certain man  yes yes-

im sure see here my coats cut i
demand a search be made  

  in his intense excitement mr bennet
laid both hands on the shoulders of the
conductor alternately shaking him and
expostulating

  shorty saunders noticing there was
trouble aboard stopped the car ran
around to the back platform and entered
car men have to fight one anothers bat-
tles  so without waiting to hear the mer-
its of the case or what it was all about
he jerked bennet away and hurled him
into his seat adding

   rough house eh old horse

   says hes robbed shorty said ex-
traman stevens  how much did you
have  	

  ten thousand dollars fumed ben-
net getting to his feet and rushing at
shorty who however held him  and
i call upon these people to witness the
treatment im getting ill hold you and
your company responsible

   youve dropped your money chal-
lenged stevens

     had it when i stepped on this car
you grinning donkey said bennet  and
some one on this car has it

  the passengers began to work them-
selves into varying stages of indignation
amazement and alarm men and women
felt for their purses and jewels arid
looked generally uncomfortable

   two police officers hove in sight

  in a few and mostly incoherent words
the situation was explained by bennet
the announcement of who he was im-
pressed the police and put an entirely
different face upon the matter

   every one on this car must be de-
tained said an officer at the door  some
money has been lost by this gentleman
any person who objects to displaying the
contents of their pockets will please step
off the car

   ill sue the company growled one
individual  what a humiliation tear-
fully announced a flouncing woman

 this is brainy police work sneered a
drummer  quite the regular procedure
they ought to call the wagon and cart us
to the station on suspicion

   denver joe sat still in his own corner
and smiled demurely it was going to be
a close pinch for him as the searching
process began an ingenious plan for dis-

n


the railroad mans magazine

posing of the well-filled wallet flashed
through him

  working the packet from his coat-
sleeve he carelessly dropped it down be-
tween the seat-wall and window-casing
and watched the perturbation of the other
passengers during the polite examination
as if it held no interest for him

  notwithstanding the murmured com-
plaints against this high-handed proce-
dure the passengers yielded up their pos-
sessions to the gaze of sergeant anderson

  hand luggage was opened to the in-
specting eyes of the officer and bennet

  the practised eye of the minion of the
law thought it beheld in denver joe a
suspicious character and accordingly
took more liberties with him than with
the others

  hal-lo drawled anderson in a
tone that denver joe dreaded have
you seen anything of this gentlemans
pocketbook 

  there was a rippling of smiles at the
pleasantry

  denver joes only fear was that they
might have a picture of him in the rogues
gallery and arrest him on general princi-
ples joe said he did not know anything
about anybodys pocketbook but his own

   whats your name and where are you
from 

   frank thompson

   well frank good-humoredly re-
marked the sergeant  will you come with
us for a few moments 

   whats the matter what do you
want me for  

   just want to see you thats all
soothingly said the officer leading him
away  i think we can dig up a record
of you no harm if your last clearance
is all right have you seen this man
before mr bennet

   no replied the magnate  not that
i can remember

   well he came in on the train with
you didnt he 

   yes-that is i guess so

   it may be that you did not have the
money when you left the train then

   oh no i was too careful to forget
it an instant officer i am certain that i
had the wallet in my pocket when i board-
ed the street-car

   be careful what you say whispered
the officer aside n the chances are that

this crafty guy has a confederate-a
woman

   youre making a big mistake this
time said denver joe with evident con-
sciousness of innocence  im an honest
working man and-

    cut it out-cut it out  sternly com-
manded the bluecoat  now you know
all about this and youll have to tell us
where that money is

   not me  cant tell you you wont
get that out of me because i know noth-
ing about it

  mr bennet expressed his doubts about
the dishonesty of joe but he followed the
officers to the police station  while car 
worth ten thousand dollars more than she
was a quarter of an hour before rolled
on down-town

  denver joe was put through the sweat-
ing process for two hours but the results
were trifling he told a straightforward
story of his arrival in the city claiming
that he had not paid any attention to mr
bennet

  taken in connection with mr bennets
own statement that lie had boarded the
car with the money and a few seconds
later missed it together with the further
apparent fact that the thief if on that car
had had no opportunity to dispose of the
roll constituted in the opinion of the
chief  a baffling case of robbery

  the following morning when bennet
reached the station the chief greeted him
with the discouraging information that
there were no clues

   unless he added  you have thought
of some circumstances between the time
you left the train and reached the street-
car that would help to throw light on the
matter i believe your coat was rifled
before you came to the car

   no somewhat resentfully declared
bennet  it was an extraordinary emer-
gency i carried my wits with me i
know that i had that money with me
when i took mv seat in the i street-car
there was as usual a big crowd and
great confusion and knowing that it
was risky i was very careful

   dont advertise until you hear from
me said the chief at the close of the
interview  well keep this fellow un-
der surveillance after letting him go-
it may be lie has a woman accomplice
we are apt to strike a clue that will
the stolen ten thousand



obviate the necessity for paying a large

	reward besides here the chief grew
chesty  my detectives can find the mon-
ey if it is to be found

iii

   the usual inquisitorial device and
promise of reward failed to move denver
joe who chuckled
to himself that he
was the real mas-
ter of the situa-
tion

  although in-
formed that the
loser would pay
a big sum for in-
formation leading
to the recovery of
the roll besides
insinuating mi-
ni unit y from
prosecution j oe
seemed to know
no m ore than
when first taken
into custody

  he knew the
ways of the po-
lice they were
as unreliable as a
w o m a  in the
 lifting  busi-
ness he would
have  o n e of
them the police
usually extracted
the important in-
formation from a poor devil in a jail
cell with  boo-boo-the-pen-for-
life  to him

   then they captured the booty the
public approbation and the reward
when they did see fit to let a prisoner
go free he got no consideration-not
even the price of an honest mans meal

   well if that little roll lying between
 the ribs of  ever got back into his
 hands it would be his surely no use
 for him to tell the police where it was
 for that would be his commitment to the
 penitentiary beyond a doubt

  on monday afternoon denver joe
was much surprised to find himself re-
leased from the tank

he wandered up the street with a

feeling that he was being watched by a
fly hound of the force if he could
only locate number  in which re-
posed his golden prize a little piece
of crooked wire and he could soon re-
cover that precious wallet

  joe found his way to the street end-
ing at the union depot there he lin-
gered for an hour but  did not appear

he fancied he
saw the conduc-
tor on a passing
car but discreet-
ly got out of
sight before be-
ing recognized
he stalked up-
town again ta-
king a careful as
well as most un-
usual interest in
street-

passing

himself

j oe to

this is the police department

to a dead stop
 me out of this
business pshaw
its the central

isnt it an me
a fool to stand
here when i can
hit the phoney
wire and find out
where s run is
to-night

  going into a dingy saloon joe asked
permission to use the telephone

   this is the car-barns said a gruff
voice on the wire whats wanted
 i want the superintendent

   whod you suppose this is im
the man

  thats all right this is the police
department

  well

  wheres car s run

   what dye want to know for i
spose shes smashed something again
and the newspapers are after it eh

   thats the business of this depart-
ment where is it

   oh s on the thirteenth and
montgomery avenue branch good-by


the railroad mans magazine

   good-by

  two hours later found denver joe
trudging along the cross-town branoh
car  he noticed carried no con-
ductor after  oclock and the revenue
consisted largely of transfers it was
merely an accommodation line and the
outer terminal was at the foot of bea-
con hill it was only a short run-and
as there were few passengers his actions
would be all the more conspicuous

iv

  it was a thick night with a blanket of
fog pressing down on the town the
tracks were slippery with half-frozen
mist the lights glowed dimly the
damp cold sweeping onto the vestibule
made saunders quake to the marrow of
his bones the headlight of  winked
fitfully the current flowed erratically

  as he was proceeding out on the
 trip the headlight blinked
through the fog and fell upon the fig-
ure of a man at the crossing his hat
was set down over his eyes and as he
threw up his hand as a signal to stop
it seemed uncanny

  the car lurched forward over the un-
even crossing shorty pulled on the
brake to stop her

  just then the light threw a stronger
glare and revealed a white-cloth mask
over the chin and mouth of the figure on
the ground t

  saunderss first thought was of high-
waymen a misguided one he was at all
events for the haul of a gun-metal
watch and eighty cents shorty reflected
would not be lucrative for the calling of
a first-class road-agent

  a glance over his shoulder confirmed
his suspicions-the intending passenger
was disguised

  shorty let fly the handle of the brake
and threw the controller lever over al-
most to full speed the car responded
with a fierce leap ahead the black
shadow however caught the guide-rail
and hung on his feet slipped and his
head cracked against the corner of the
vestibule of the car his hat flew off
exposing his face

  curse you he roared ashe strug-
gled on the platform stop the car
or ill knock your head off

 what do you want demanded
shorty  youre a ohump if youre
looking for dough on this run

  none of your business what  want
ive lost something inside and im go-
ing after it just mind your own
affairs  stop her  

   not much ejaculated saunders
game to the core

  not seeing any gun in the play yet he
thought he could take his chances in a
rough-and-tumble with his hold-up pas-
senger

   youve got a funny way of looking
for things friend lost articles can be
found at the office of the company lets
see your face maybe tis a joke
suddenly saunders snatched away the
handkerchief  well youre a bird-
the reply was a stout crack from
denver joes fist squarely upon saun-
derss jaw the doughty motorman
reeled backward against the window of
the vestibule smashing the glass and
cutting a gash in his forehead the
blood streamed into his eyes

  the sting of the cut brought shortys
fighting blood welling the controller
lever came off with a jerk shorty
swung it and delivered a smashing blow
upon the highwaymans skull denver
joe went down with a cry he tumbled
backward off the platform

  saunderss senses were whirling in
vain did he try to replace the lever on
the motor-box controller it fell from
his nerveless hand

  he sank fainting on the platform and
 with rare intelligence and freakish
wisdom shook off the burden of the body
near a lonely crossing and ran on her way
untrammeled

  the course of the car was decorous
enough until she approached the inter-
secting cross-tracks of the independent
system at this point an old abandoned
switch connected with the double tracks
of montgomery avenue the rails were
half submerged under dirt and gravel
they had not been used since the pioneer
line was constructed

  when  struck the split-rail section
at full tilt the flanges of the front
wiheels took the old turn gracefully and
threw the long unused frog over

  with satanic perversity she rolled over
onto the down-town track of the rival
the stolen ten thousand



shorty swung it and delivered a smashing blow

    street - car system the spring
    switch dropping back into place
    as she started up the avenue 
    a five-per-cent grade

      fifty yards away from the
    switch the trolley-wheel slipped
    off and  stopped then the
    law of gravity asserted itself

    she segan to roll down grade

     she gathered  quick-
     ly her brake-chains clattering
     free she charged forward in the
     murky atmosphere as if seeking
     an enemy to destroy the trolley
     pole bobbed and swayed and
     struck out menacingly in every
     direction

      fastenings were torn from
    poles wires tumbled guy
    lines burned and sizzled louder
    ard louder roared the motor cogs car
     passed the turnout switches careened
    fearfully on the curves but kept to the
    main track

       telephone lines were set blazing as the
     flying trolley-pole rasped live wires
     sudden blazes started awakening and
     frightening dozens of households the
     fire department was called out

       one of the motors exploded under the
    pressure of the terrific voltage of sud-
    den contacts persons abroad on bhe
    streets were appalled by the remarkable
    vision of the veritable chariot of fire
    winging its way recklessly through the
    public thoroughfares

      at the foot of montgomery avenue
    the tracks curved onto the trunk line
    here there were cars from four direc-
    tions crossing and turning on a perfect
    gridiron of tracks into the network 
    plunged the sparks flying from her
    wheels her motor - box ablaze and the
    scrape of the flanges  the guide-rail
    singing her death-knell

       she tore loose the curving rails and
    then bounded diagonally to the oppo-
    site corner-an elegant home of brown-
    stone fronted by two large spruce-trees
    and a yard guarded by a neat fence her
    course was set unerringly for the first
    of the big trees which cut ilier through
    as a knife



  a shower of splinters and glass filled
the air as portions of the dismembered
car demolished the fence

  her trucks were curled up in hope-
less confusion

  her brake-rods were rammed through
the mass of the wreck while her motors
lay in smoking pieces on the curb and
her entrails were piled up like flotsam of
the sea

v

  about tour oclock that morning
shorty saunders was picked up half
dead from exposure and loss of blood
and taken to a hospital

  while he tossed upon a white cot
fighting imaginary foes in fevered de-
lirium workmen gathered up the wreck
of the hoodoo

  in the last of a pile of window-
frames and a section of the battered
runaway was extricated the next day a
leather package filled with currency

  bozzon the barn boss took a long
look when he examined the package he
wiped his eyes again and again as he ex-
pressed his astonishment the money
was duly turned in at headquarters and
claimed by bennet but no one connected
with the finding of the package could
offer tlie least explanation of how it
rame to be in i he wreck


the railroad mans magazine

  general manager phillips was per-
plexed- beyond measure this perplex-
ity was increased by two circumstances
while they were all waiting-and hoping
very earnestly-for the recovery of
saunders

  some days later the general manager
received an anonymous letter through
the mails he threw it in the waste-
basket and having thought about it a
second time dug it out and sent for the
detectives

  the unsigned communication called
his attention to the fact that the man
guilty of the stupendous robbery of -

	from the lumber magnate was the
motorman who had picljed up the money
when it was lost and had hidden it in
the car

  another circumstance that puzzled
the general manager was a newspaper
article which professed to have inside
knowledge of the plot of a great rob-
bery that had been planned the rob-
bers had been foiled the paper said and
had seized a street-car to hasten their es-
cape from the city

  denver joe conducted his anonymous
correspondence from an adjoining city
and announced he was ready to take his
share of the reward for testifying against
the tlrief he gave as a reason for not
denouncing the thief at the time that he
expected the motorman to split with him
hearing that the car had been annihi-

lated and the missing treasure found he
was willing to make a clean breast of it
for a consideration he would substan -
tiate his story and show up in person

  this seemed plausible enough until
an investigation set afoot by the general
manager cleared up the matter on
the day that saunders was able to come
down to the office of the general man-
ager a pinkerton man corralled the
clever denver joe and he confessed

  superintendent skinner had been in-
clined to think saunders had ben drink-
ing on the night of the runaway and had
let  get away from him this was
sternly denied by the general manager

  and shorty sat up and took notice
when phillips said

   bennet the man who lost this mon-
ey has left in my hands a little remem-
brance of  for you you didnt
know of course continued phillips
with his keen eyes fixed upon the motor-
man  you didnt know that the man
who lifted the roll from bennet was on
your car and when about to be discov-
ered with the roll on him dropped it in
the ribs of  as well as the tiny pair
of shears with which the job was done

   the man had no time to escape and
got rid of the money in that way can
you identify the man who tried to stop
your car on thirteenth street the night
you got hurt

    that i can declared saunders

 blondie  reynolds made up time

the new york centrals fast train from
new york to st louis arrived on
schedule time says the st louis globe-
deviocrat and after a loss of thirty-five min-
utes was made on the eastern division it was
up to the mattoon division to make up for
the lost time of the twenty-four-hour run

  when it became apparent that something
had to be done the new york central offi-
cials sent out a call for engineer  blondie 
reynolds tie was out on the line but was
soon under way to mattoon and when the
west-bound train steamed in he was ready to
receive her grim determination in his face
as he climbed into the cab

  then began such a feat as will go down in
the history of fast trains for many years to
come he and his fireman held the engine

conductor thomas lawlor and his right-
hand man charles scanton  held the train
on the track and in a few minutes after
leaving mattoon the passengers were on their
feet in the aisles with the trainmen watches
in hand cheering as each mile was gained

  at granite city a shout went up  blon-
die  reynolds had done the seemingly im-
possible he had not only made up the
thirty-five minutes but he had put the big
train twelve minutes ahead of time when
she struck the maze of the terminal tracks
he was fifteen minutes ahead but there was
a little loss in getting into the station

  not enough though to lose the day there
was still eight minutes leeway when the ob-
servation-car shot under the roof of the
ltnion station
possibilities of the gyroscope

by c f carter

the present curiosity among railroad men incited by the publicity that
lias recently been given to the gyroscope or monorail car leads us to
ask mr carter to write a fair-minded and conservative article based
on the adaptability of this new contrivance to railroad service

     many railroad men have been led to believe that the brennan and scherl
inventions are destined to revolutionize present railroad conditions such
is far from the case although they certainly rank with the greatest inventions
of the day they are far from being taken seriously and no railroad man need
have any fear that the near future will be altered by the principles of gyrostatic
balancing

the two-rail system will be in operation for some time to come

how the gyroscope monorail car operates a principle that is not
new what some experts have to say about
it as a practical railroad issue

yer since louis brennan ex-
hibited in london last fall
a car which runs upon a
single rail and is prevented
from falling to either side
by the resistance of two
gyroscopes carried on the car and mr
richard scherl of berlin exhibited a
similar contrivance much has been pub-
lished to make the traveling public be-
lieve that the day of the two-rail track is
about over and the era of the monorail is
about to dawn

  indeed the inventions of messrs bren-
nan and scherl have been heralded so
fully that the humble track-walker has-
been led to believe that the day is coming
when his weekly wage will be cut in half
because he has to walk along one rail in-
stead of two

  the car propelled by gyroscopic mech-
anism is far from beinganything but an
experiment and as yet is so infinitesimal
a factor in changing the standard princi-
ples of railroading that it future is ex-
tremely doubtful

  undoubtedly it is one of the most re-
markable inventions of this or any age-
but is it practical and will it pay

  this is a question that must be asked
when anything new is brought out that is
intended to make a complete revolution
in established principles

  from what we can gather it is evident
that speaking in the kindliest way the
answer must be  no

  the ease of the gyroscope car was ad-
mirably summed up in six sentences in
the engineering news of may  
after mr brennan had first exhibited his
invention and had made such extrava-
gant prophecies concerning its future de-
velopment as a prominent consulting
mechanical engineer and the operating
vice-president of one of the trunk-lines
told me substantially the same thing
though at greater length in expressing
their views on the matter in the month
of january  the briefer statement
may be worth recalling here it is

   that the feat is a scientific marvel of
the first magnitude will certainly be




the railroad mans magazine

agreed to by all turning now to the
projects for the practical application of
the invention we confess ourselves unable
to see any prospect of the use of such a
system of transport as a competitor of
the ordinary two-rail railway

   granting all the claims of the in-
ventor it appears impossible that any
such system could seriously be consid-
ered for a high-speed line since it would
be inherently more dangerous than the
ordinary two-rail system the proposi-
tion of the inventor to operate cars of
extraordinary widths on this system may
also be set down as an absurdity the
chief practical field for the invention if
the claims for it are substantiated on fur-
ther investigation would appear to be
for the construction of very light cheap
lines for handling traffic of small volume

   some form of transportation line
which can be built and maintained at
small cost is needed in a thousand places
such as mining and logging railroads
pioneer and military lines for contractors
use and on ranches and plantations

a conservative view

  hart o berg who brought the scherl
car to america takes a conservative view
of the invention which will go far toward
restoring the confidence in it that has
been sacrificed by oversanguine enthusi-
asts he said

   we are not advancing the gyroscope
monorail car as a perfected invention
but only as an idea that is worth devel-
oping we have brought the car over
here to get it before american engineers
to let them get their wits to work upon it

   we are not going to form any stock
companies and we are not going to build
any monorail lines yet we have had
several inquiries from parties who want-
ed a line on our system for various pur-
poses

   well build them all right if any one
wants to pay the price but our prices are
not framed to invite business instead
we always cordially recommend the pres-
ent type of two-rail line

   as we hold the basic patents for the
gyroscope we can afford to play a wait-
ing game and that is precisely what we
are doing any one who invents an im-
provement of any kind for the gyroscope-

car will naturally coiiie to us and we
as well as the inventor will be benefited

for military purposes

  mr bergs views are sound and con-
servative he thinks it not unlikely that
the first practical application of the gyro-
scope monorail system may be for mili-
tary purposes next he thinks it might
be found peculiarly adapted for subway
construction in a close-fitting tube the
thing simply couldnt fall over if it
tried finally he is not certain but what
it may be found to have speed possibili-
ties but he makes no predictions

  mr berg has acquired the habit of
taking improbable things in hand and
making them work he was concerned
in the manufacture of the first automatic
pistol the first successful automobile the
first submarines and he took up the busi-
ness affairs of the wright brothers the
first manufacturers of flying - machines
when they went to europe

  the scherl gyroscope car which mr
berg brought to america was exhibited
in brooklyn in january it was a work-
ing model  feet long and feet wide
weighing  pounds it had seats for
four passengers and a motorman it was
mounted on two trucks each having two
small wheels tandem

  the wheels had double flanges to keep
them on the single rail the car was
driven by ordinary motors taking the
current through shoes in contact with
copper wires on each side of the rail

how they work

  the interest in the car of course cen-
tered in the gyroscopes of which there
were two suspended inside the frame of
the car beneath the seats the gyro-
scopes are simply tops consisting of
steel disks about sixteen inches in diame-
ter mounted on vertical axes and hence
revolving in horizontal planes like any
other tops but enclosed in steel vacuum
chambers the gyroscopes made up 
per cent of the weight of the car

  the descriptions of the apparatus were
more remarkable for what they omitted
than for what they revealed  for the de-
tails are guarded secrets at present

  each gyroscope was driven by an
possibilities of the gyroscope



electric motor of three-tenths of a horse-
power mounted directly on the shaft
the gyroscopes turned in opposite di-
rections at the rate of  revolutions
a minute as was shown by speed-indica-
tors in front of the motorman

  at first the inventors tried running the
gyroscopes in the open air this re-
quired  amperes at  volts but
when they tried a vacuum two and a half
amperes sufficed

its first application

  an interesting feature was that the
gyroscopes were pivoted crosswise of the
car so that they would tilt forward and
backward freely but could not move
sidewise

  the peculiar gyroscopic principle
which enables a top or wheel set to spin-
ning in a given plane to hold to that
plane regardless of the laws of gravita-
tion has been understood and utilized
for a good- many years

  foucalt the french physicist made
use of it in an experiment half a century
ago to demonstrate the rotation of the
earth

  soon after l obry of trieste france
invented a steering-gear for torpedoes in
which a gyroscope was used to control
the rudder and hold the torpedo on a
predetermined course obrys invention
made the torpedo an effective instrument
of war and it is still steered by his ap-
paratus

  in  professor piazzi smyth used
the gyroscopic principle in a device in-
tended to secure a steady support for an
astronomical telescope at sea

used on ships

  dr otto sell lick used a gyrostat in an
experiment in  to diminish the roll-
ing of ships although the experiment
was an unqualified success no vessel has
yet been equipped with a gyrostat

 finally louis brennan england
and august scherl of germany work-
ing independently and unknown to each
other tried the gyroscope as a means of
maintaining the equilibrium of a mono-
rail car mr brennan who by the way
is the inventor of a torpedo which is
steered by wires which it unrolls as it

pursues its course was the first to an-
nounce his discovery and he was able to
obtain a patent on the plan for enclosing
the gyroscope in a vacuum chamber

  mr scherl and his collaborator paul
froelisch however got ahead of mr
brennan when they discovered that the
gyroscope needed a little help this was
provided by an apparatus which they
called a  servo-motor

  when the car leans to one side and the
gyroscope tries to pull it back the
 servo-motor by means of a delicately
adjusted series of brass levers enclosed
in a glass case automatically feeds itself
some electric current which generates
power by which a pull is exerted by
means of levers and reach-rods on the
gyroscopes to tilt them farther over and
thus intensify their action

  as the car returns to an even keel the
current is automatically shut oft from the
servo-motor the gyroscopes are con-
nected by means of toothed quadrants
so that they both tilt together at the
same angle

props for stops

  there are props on each side of a car
which are put down to support a car
when a stop is made

  the operation of the gyroscopes is en-
tirely independent of the running of the
car they keep right on spinning no
matter whether th car is running for-
ward or backward fast or slow or is
standing still their function is solely
to keep the car upright

  their axis of rotation is normally at
right angles to the track if the car tips
to either side the upper ends of the gyro-
scopes rotate slowly in a circle just like
a spinning-top in an effort to bring their
axes of rotation parallel to the mono-
rail the circle described by the top
grows smaller until it disappears this
kind of movement is called  preces-
sional motion it is a law of gyro-
scopic motion that if precession is
hastened the body rises in opposition to
gravity

  the gyroscopes being rigidly attached
to the car arc practically a part of it
and the servo-motor by accelerating pre-
cession causes the depressed side of the
car to rise promptly as it rises it causes

cnmfut

standard track

a precessional movement in the opposite
direction which checks an tendency to
oscillate

  this process had an uncanny effect
when the car was brought out on the
track that had been laid around clermont
skating rink in brooklyn and left
standing empty it would sometimes sway
slightly to and fro like a man who had
celebrated not wisely but too much

  the weight of five or six men always
had a sobering effect however and the
car would make the circuit of the rink
steadily enough always leaning inward
in going around a curve in proportion to
load and speed

heavy side rises

                           - 

  if one or more of the passengers threw
themselves on the side of the car instead
of upsetting the heavy side would rise

  when running empty the car would
lean in farther on curves than when
loaded always straightening up on an

                               even keel on reaching a tangent
                               in other words the gyroscopes
                               did for the monorail car what
                               superelevation and easement
                               curves do for two-rail trains

                                that the gyroscope will con-
                              tinue to revolve from its own
                              momentum after the current is
                              shut off was proved when a
                              fuse burned out as the car was
                              being taken out on the floor

                              it made the circuit of the

 tions a minute while the other was only
 making  but they held the car

old and new method of rounding curves

   noise and vibration

  the humming of the gyroscopes makes
a loud roar which sounds much like a
planer dressing a knotty board they
also cause a vibration that to a passenger
possessed of nerves is intolerable until
the fearful noise and vibration are elim-
inated the gyroscope car can hardly be
considered desirable for passenger traffic

  many preposterous claims for the gy-
roscope monorail system have been made
in print whenever they are questioned
the doubter is reminded that all sorts of
dire failures were predicted for the rail-
road less than a century ago but the
circumstances are totally different

  the world did not know anything at
all about railroads in the second decade
of the last century and may therefore be
pardoned fon failing to grasp at once

view showing gyroscopic movements

   if the table representing platform of car be tilted transversely the iryroscopic fly-wheel will tilt fore or
aft according to the direction of its rotation and there will be developed a strong resistance to the move-
ment of the table this fore-and-aft movement is called the precession
possibilities of the gyroscope



  their possibilities but a great
  deal has been learned since and
  while a great deal more remains
  to be learned certain elementary
  things are so well understood
  that there is no excuse for not
  recognizing the limitations they
  impose

    to begin with the monorail
  car is wholly dependent upon
  the gyroscope to keep it upright
  while a well-built gyroscope is
  perhaps no more likely to break
  down than any other well-built
  machine it is certainly not less
  liable to do so it must there-
  fore be considered as an added
  element of danger not possessed
  by the two-rail road

    as for the extravagant claims
  for great speed that have been
  made in behalf of the gyroscope
  car it must not be forgotten that
  there are certain obstacles to
  overcome in maintaining high
  speed that are always the same
  whether the car runs on one rail
  or on six

    one of these is atmospheric
  resistance for moderate speed
  this is relatively unimportant
  but on getting up to sixty miles
  an hour or more it becomes a
  thing to be considered

 at  miles an hour the
 atmospheric resistance is nearly
 four times as great as at  miles
 an hour to drive a car  feet
 wide and  feet high at the
 rate of  miles an hour
 which has been soberly pro-
 posed as quite within the bounds
 of possibility for the monorail
 it would be necessary to over-
 come an atmospheric resistance
 of  pounds which alone
 would require  horse-
 power

    it has been claimed that the
  monorail car can go around phe-
  nomenally sharp curves as a
  matter of fact the ordinary two-
  rail car is hauled around curves
  on wharves and docks in city
  streets and elsewhere quite as
  sharp as any the monorail is al-
  leged to be able to negotiate

      r r

the railroad mans magazine

but these curves are taken cautiously and
at slow speed

climbing the grades

  the tendency of a monorail truck
traveling at high speed to go straight
ahead on striking a curve is not likely
to be any less than that of the ordinary
truck the single wheel will be just as
prone to climb the rail and land the
train in a corn-field as two wheels travel-
ing side by side

  it is rather difficult to see just how
the gyroscope is going to enable mono-
rail cars to climb any steeper grades
than are possible for ordinary cars

  a car cannot go beyond a certain limit
no matter how many rails it runs on or
how its wheels are arranged unless one
of the wheels happen to be a cog-wheel
traveling in a rack

  the steepest grade climbed by an ad-
hesion locomotive on a railroad handling
miscellaneous traffic was ten per cent
that feat was accomplished on a tem-
porary track on the baltimore and ohio
in s the achievement has not been
duplicated since and no one wants to
duplicate it

  railroad men are not lying awake
nights studying out ways to build lines
with steeper gradients their one idea is
to reduce the grades they have and they
are rendered unhappy by a grade of one
per cent

calling on imagination

  even if by the magic of the gyroscope
cars could be enabled to climb abnormal
grades the feat could be accomplished
only at an expenditure of power out of
all proportion to the results

  as for the proposal to bridge wide
chasms simply by stretching a cable upon
which the monorail is to cross like a
slack-rope walker with the gyroscopes
instead of a balancing-pole to maintain
its equilibrium no engineer will take that
too seriously

  and no matter how-many rails a train
runs on the imperative necessity of being
able to stop quickly as well as to get up
speed remains unchanged just how the
braking power of a car is to be increased
by robbing it of half its wheels has not

been explained by those who talk of run-
ning from  to  miles an hour

  the fascination which the monorail
has exercised upon the imagination of
inventors is one of the most curious
things in the history of the railroad al-
most from the very beginning men have
sought to improve the railroad by taking
away half its rails

an old story

  thomas telford the great scottish
engineer who played so conspicuous a
part in developing internal improvements
in england and sweden first proposed
the monorail as long ago as  since
then a continuous succession of inventors
has patented various forms of single-rail
railways all of which were to revolu-
tionize the worlds transportation sys-
tems but none of which has done so

  in  f i rowan read a paper be-
fore the society of arts in london ad-
vocating the building of monorail lines
as pioneer railways for undeveloped and
difficult countries

  in s charles lartigue a french
engineer built primitive monorail lines
in algeria and tunis that were operated
by horse-power

  f b behr took up lartigues idea
building an experimental line near vic-
toria street westminster in  two
years later he built a short line from
listowel to ballybunion ireland which
was operated for several years

  in  behr had an exhibition mono-
rail at the brussels exposition running
cars  feet long  feet  inches wide
and weighing  tons on one occasion
he claimed to have attained a speed of
 miles an hour

and there are others

  lartigue and behrs system was real-
ly not a monorail but a five-rail arrange-
ment the principal rail from which
the weight of the car was suspended was
placed  feet above the ground at the
apex of a-shaped supports one meter
apart

  on either side of these a-shaped sup-
ports were two guide - rails on which
wheels ran to prevent oscillation there
were eight vertical double-flanged wheels
possibilities of

the gyroscope



	feet  inches in diameter and  small
guide-wheels

  an attempt was made to build a behr
monorail line between manchester and
liverpool in  on which the usual
miraculous speed-which seems to be an
inseparable feature of all monorail
schemes - was to be maintained but
nothing came of it

  behr also tried to get up a company in
 to build a monorail line from new
york city to coney island but that
also fell through and since then nothing
further has been heard of his system

other systems

  on the outskirts of new york city a
monorail line three miles long is being
built from bartow to belden point on
city island while the weight of the
car is actually carried on a single rail it
is really a three-rail system in order to
maintain the car in an upright position
two light suspended rails are carried on
supports above the track

  wheels bearing against these balance
the car and also serve the purpose of
trolley-poles

  the tunis system as it is called is
very similar to the e moody boynton
system which was extensively exploited
in  but which nevertheless met the
usual fate of the monorail

  the only true monorail system in ac-
tual operation to-day is the langen sus-
pension line from elberfeld to barmen
germany it is an elevated structure
from which cars  feet long are sus-
pended from a single rail instead of run-
ning on two rails above the structure

  if the monorail having the moral
support of the gyroscope can succeed in
living down such a past as that it will
be welcomed by engineers and railroad
men alike

what an authority says

  the scientific american in a recent
editorial says

    brennan and scherl cach working in-
  dependently of the other have recently
  proved that a car containing a pair of
  gyroscopes can be run upon a single
  rail and maintain its stability under
  varying conditions of eccentric loading

  side winds and curving track upon
  seeing a practical demonstration of this
  fact and submitting the car as the
  writer recently did to various severe
  and successfully endured tests it is nat-
  ural in the first moment of enthusi-
  asm to predict an immediate and wide-
  spread application of the system or
  even the eventual abandonment of the
  present two-rail track and trains in
  favor of the monorail type

    sober second thought however must
  convince any thoughtful and practical
  mind that in spite of the brilliant re-
  sults of the recent demonstration the
  monorail gyroscopic car in the nature
  of things can have only a more or less
  limited application under present day
  conditions

    it seems to us that if there is a future
  for the new system it will be found in
  the construction of pioneer railways
  through undeveloped country and
  particularly through mountainous and
  hilly country where the line must of
  necessity be very circuitous the self-
  adjusting qualities of the car enable it
  to run around curves which would be
  altogether impossible for a two-track
  railroad the monorail track could be
  located around a hill or bluff through
  which a two-track railroad would have
  to pass with heavy and expensive ex-
  cavation moreover for this class of
  railroad a much lighter car would be
  practicable and extremely high speeds
  would not be demanded this decrease
  in weight and speed would mean a
  great reduction in first cost and subse-
  quent cost of- maintenance of the
  system

    if the new type should demonstrate
  in service of this kind its commercial
  practicability it is quite conceivable
  that it would be gradually applied to the
  more important lines of travel and
  eventually to the main trunk roads

opinion of an engineer

  s l f deyo chief engineer of the
interborough rapid transit company
said after seeing the car in operation

   i do not think the monorail car has
passed out of the experimental stage yet
but that is not saying that i do not be
lieve that some day it will come into use
for certain kinds of travel if there were
a collision for instance and a monorail
car were derailed it would probably turn
turtle in such a case i would prefer to
be on board of a two-rail car

how komo bill went

east

            by william david ball

               he made up his mind to quit
               the cattle country-and he did

e fall round-up was over
the last drive of a thousand
steers had been made to
wolcott the shipping point
komo bill night-wrangler
for the t y outfit sat on
his heels near where the cook was wash-
ing dishes and stared moodily into the
camp-fire

   say chub he began by way of
opening a conversation  dont you ever
get tired a cookin an a washin crock-
ery

  naw answered chub id rather
sling chuck than get shook up the way
you do sometimes what you got on
your mind komo 

  komo looked up gloomily  tired
thats all he answered  this bucka-
rooin life is gettin stale

there was no comment from chub
komo resumed his watching of the fire
presently he got up with an air of weari-
ness kicked a loose sage-brush into the
fire and again addressed the cook

   im goin east chub

  that so said chub mildly in-
quisitive

   yep take the stage from kremm-

	in on tuesday probably go to chicago
or new york

  the cooks face lighted up with a sud-
den thought

   say komo he laughed  you aint
got no money and the rest of the boys is
broke wherell you get the cash
komo smiled a superior smile and
glanced at chub patronizingly  you
leave that to me chub ill get there
komo bill with the air of a man about
to order out his private car sauntered over
to where tlie horses were corralled around
the camp-fire that night the boys were

 told of komos new plan komo him-
 self was absent-gone to the ranch six
 miles away to see the foreman the cook
 related what had passed between himself
 and komo bill and also gave his opinion
 about the matter

    komoll never get to chicago with-
 out he rides a box car he said  he
 cant borrow no money an the cattle-
 trains has all gone whats he goin to
 do 

   various plans of more wit than sense
 were suggested by the sympathetic lis-
 teners they were used to komo bills
  lay-offs as they called them but till
 now he had manifested no desire to travel
 farther east than denver that he should
 start for chicago or new york furnished
 good material for comment and amuse-
 ment  but it scarcely caused surprise

    you listen to me boys said petey
 johnson ill stake my last bean that
 komoll make good hes got brains

   in the morning komo bill started for
 kremmling  a horse borrowed from
 the outfit the farewells were said cas-
  uallv and consisted for the most part of
  so long komo  and  so long ole
 man 

   as the night - wrangler rode over the
 nearest butte his comrades caught a few
 fault words from one of their favorite
 songs

    oil ill sell my horse an ill sell my
       saddle

   ill ride no more for the t y cattle

   komo bill stood in front of tlie texas
 steer the largest saloon in kremmling
 and watched the stage as it lumbered up
 to the post-office and general store one
 passenger alighted - a slim well-knit
 man of medium height who walked


the railroad mans magazine

quickly up the street and entered a res-
taurant

  komo watched the newcomer with in-
terest his clothes were perfect they
reminded komo of the east and also that
to-morrow was tuesday-the time he had
set for his going

  as yet he had failed to raise the money
for his fare he had borrowed eleven
dollars from jake the sheriff eleven

   this is the hardest proposition i ever
tried to rope he grumbled as he fixed
his eyes meditatively on the restaurant
windows  guess ill take a walk and
think it over

  the one thing lacking thus far in the
present problem was opportunity this
was to come in the person of the stran-
ger who had just alighted from the coach
and whom komo bill-had keenly noticed

i have a somewhat difficult job on my hands

dollars komo figured would just about
pay his stage fare to the railroad station
it would be the height of folly to start
with such a ridiculously small sum the
roulette-wheel in the texas steer had ta-
ken the eleven dollars and komo had
taken a walk to see the stage come in

 a settled gloom darkened komos
face he growled an unintelligible an-
swer to the bartenders friendly greeting
and passed to the rear of the saloon the
two private card-rooms were unoccupied
-or so komo thought he entered the
first and sat down at the table the door
how komo bill wlint hast



between the two rooms was partly open
presently he heard voices

   jake and that dude feller he com-
mented without interest he half rose
from his chair to shut the door but sat
down again quietly with his head bent
forward

  the stranger was speaking

   yes you see i have a somewhat diffi-
cult job on my hands he was saying
 the kidnaping occurred ten years ago
at the wharf in new york harbor this
joe borden has had plenty of time to
change his appearance he is described
as tall well built with brown eyes and
hair and a slight limp in his left leg

   at the time the affair made but little
stir now however legal complications
have arisen in the will of a rich new
york man the relatives want joe bor-
den information has come to headquar-
ters that he is here at kremmling or in
the near vicinity i want your help
sheriff your cooperation-

   ill help you stranger the sheriff
interrupted  but hold your lines a min-
ute till i get my memory goin seems
like ive heard a friend of mine tell of
joe borden an if i recollect right he
said joe borden was dead-died in new
mexico i believe

   but  aint certain about it at all
your man may be right in town now for
all we know say ill be busy from now
till along bout two oclock but you stick
around an ill bring my friend sos you
can talk to him yourself

  komo bill quietly let himself out the
rear door his face was radiant with
smiles

   joe never did talk much bout his
wild and frivolous boyhood he mused
 but i never knew he was that bad
anyhow i got brown eyes an brown
hair-an i guess i can limp too when it
comes to a show-down

  komo bills preparations were quickly
made alone in his room he put on a
black suit it was somewhat faded and
wrinkled but still it was a black suit-a
mark of respectability he buckled on
his belt and made sure that the big 
colts worked easily in the holster

  carefully he locked the door and
pulled down the window-shade a few
clothes and trinkets thrust into a battered

	telescope and everything was in readi-

ness his saddle chaps and spurs he had
already entrusted to jake with minute in-
structions as to their welfare he sat
down crossed his feet on the window-sill
and briefly reviewed his plan of cam-
paign

  at two oclock he would interview the
stranger in the private room of the texas
steer at four oclock if all went well
when the stage from steamboat passed
through he would be on his way to the far
east

  but during those two hours the sheriff
must be absent by some method or other
be must be put out of the way komo bill
smiled broadly he had devised a method

  a knock on the door komo turned
his head and grinned at the door-knob
the knock was repeated some one de-
scended the stairs

   must be bout two oclock said ko-
mo as he peered through a slit in the
window-shade he saw the sheriff cross
the street enter the post-office and after
a few moments come out hurriedly

   campin on my trail  exclaimed
the delighted komo he craned his neck
until the sheriff disappeared around a
corner

  a moment later  telescope  in hand
he walked into the post-office

   sheriff is looking for you komo
said the storekeeper

  there was a general laugh from the
men standing around every one knew
of the friendship that existed between
komo bill and jake

  that so queried komo blandly
 im lookin fer him too you know
jimmy of the  four - bar - four -i met
him this mornin an he says he saw
duck flinn the rustler bout three miles
east of yampa if you see jake let him
know

  the news started a commotion two
of the men rushed out and sprang to
their horses komo bill followed wa-
ving aside the eager questions and ex-
cited demands for further information
as he entered the texas steer he saw the
two horsemen turn the corner in pursuit
of the sheriff

  the hands of the clock above the mir-
ror pointed to a quarter past two bill
set his  telescope  down near the door
and hurried to the room where he knew
the detective waited


the railroad mans magazine

  he opened the door and stepped in
the stranger with his hands clasped be-
hind him stood looking at the pictures
on the wall at the noise he turned

  for an instant the two men faced each
other komo bill gave a quick start of
alarm and whipped out his revolver his
eyes shone with fierce questioning from
beneath the xvide slouch-hat the stran-
ger looked calmly at the black muzzle
pointed at his breast

  there was  fear-not even surprise
-in his eyes

   sit down said komo in a low voice
 put your hands on the table the
stranger obeyed

  when komo spoke again there was less
strain in his voice

   i reckon you aint had much expe-
rience with the business end of a gun
people in this here country generally
throws up their hands

  the stranger laughed

   oh he replied  you see when i
know that the man with whom i am
dealing is  the square i take chances
komo smiled at the compliment but
did not relax his vigilance the man at
the table leaned on his elbows and in-
quired smoothly

   might i ask the reason for this little
-eh-

  gun-play suggested komo as he
threw one leg over the back of a chair
and rested his gun on his knee  no
you cant ask just now youre a detec-
tive aint you 

  the question came sharply but the
stranger did not move his voice was
low and even as he answered

   i dont see just how that concerns
you but i dont mind telling you that i
am not a detective

   oh   said komo there was a world
of relief in his voice

  fie slipped his revolver back into the
holster and went on to explain

   mostly i can tell a detective by in-
stinct but sometimes i get off the trail
detectives have a way of snootin around
in things that dont concern them now
some folks thinks im dead which of
course aint nobodys business but i aint
earin to have no detective tie on to it
the strangers dark eyebrows lifted
slightly his next question came in a
voice even smoother than before

   what is your name 

  komos smile was genial and confiden-
tial-in fact there was a trace of silli-
ness in his smile-as he answered 

   theyve called me bill-komo bill
-ever since i came from new york
about oh about nine or ten years ago i
guess

  again there was an
almost imperceptible
upward twitching of
the dark eyebrows
komo took no notice
but turned and walked
to a small table in the
corner the stran-
gers eyes sparkled-
there was a slight but
unmistakable limp in
komos left leg

   lets have a game
of pitch said komo
cheerfully picking up
a deck of cards from
the table he turned
to confront the muz-
zle of a revolver held
within a foot of his
head his teeth came
together with a click

   i guess i aint
takin no chances this

people in this here country generally throws up
their hands
how komo bill went east



time he remarked dryly as his hands
went up above his head

  right about face snapped the
stranger komo pivoted on his heel a
light hand removed his gun and deftly
felt his pockets

er sharply you go because you are
wanted now to business as i un-
derstand it the stage for wolcott starts
at four oclock we leave then if you
have any clothes to take get them at
once ordinarily  handcuff my man

why dont you fix it now

         you may face this way   the stran-
      ger was seated on the table with his feet
      on a chair  you are going back to new
      york with me joe borden he said
      watching komo with narrowed eyelids

        the quick start and sharp intake of
     breath that greeted this announcement
     were admirable-admirable because they
     were not overdone they suggested great
     emotion restrained with difficulty

      to new york gasped komo
     besides that aint my-

         thats enough  interrupted the oth-

l 	

but in the present case -he paused and
ran his eyes over komos muscular frame
with an air of mild contempt- in this
case  feel safe in allowing you to travel
almost as if you were my companion but
remember  am quick with a gun 

    guess you got me dead to rights 
murmured komo

  the stranger put his revolver in his
hip-pocket and pointed to the door there
were no customers in the saloon the
bartender had taken advantage of this
unusual state of affairs by going to sleep


the railroad mans magazine

   lets have somethin said komo as
they neared the bar suddenly the gal-
loping of a horse sounded in the street
a fiery little bronco dashed up to the
hitching-post the sheriff swung from
the saddle

  komo bill groaned and glanced fur-
tively at the rear door

   stage cornin  shouted some one
from outside

  the sheriff entered the saloon the
stranger caught komo bill by the collar
and pushed him forward

   here hold this man  he cried in
quick incisive tones  ill return in a
moment 

  the sheriff swore as the detective
sprang past him and through the door
he turned to komo bill

   whatdo you-

  dont give me away jake dont
give me away now he thinks im joe

borden you know joes dead ten
minutes telegraphin to albuquerque will
fix things

  why dont you fix it now cried
j ake

   sh -the explain ins got to be done
at the other end cant you see he
lowered his voice impressively  im
goin east  

  the stranger appeared in the door
suit-case in hand the sheriff grinned
holding komo by the shoulder he jmshed
him roughly toward the door  you
fool  he whispered in komos ear
 why didnt you let me in sooner 

  as the stage-coach occupied by the
eastern detective and the night-wran-
gler rolled awray the sheriff of kremm-
ling pulled his long mustache

   i wonder now he mused  how
am i ever goin to get even with that cuss
fer this dick flinn business

cars and locomotives built in 

the number of cars and locomotives
built during the past year is but a
little greater than the  figures in spite
of the improvement in general business con-
ditions during  says the railzvay age-
gascttc however it has really been but a
few months since the railways came into the
market with substantial inquiries and de-
liveries on orders placed at the beginning of
this movement did not begin until this fall

lake to a junction vvitli the old line at lucin

the long serpentine route between the same
points which passed around the north shore
of the great salt lake and over promon-
tory mountain where  may   the
last spike was driven in the all-rail line
from ocean to ocean

from dry land to dry land the cut-off
covers twenty miles of pile construction

away  miles eliminates  degrees
of curvature and  vertical feet of
grade cuts down the running time of the
fastest train two hours and through its
practically gradeless route increases the ton-

  the figures referring to curvature and
grade may be rendered clearer and more
interesting by a little elaboration each de-
gree of curvature represents the segment of
a circle and there are  degrees in a
circle put these degrees of curvature to-
gether into circles and it will be seen that
between ogden and lucin there were 
circles and that every train of the old route
not onlj- covered the air-line distance but
ran around the ns circles besides the
number of vertical feet disposed of was

it takes one horsc-power to raise 
pounds vertically one foot per minute and
that therefore it would require two horse-
power to raise the loaded car vertically the
same distance per minute multiply by the

	feet of grade disposed of multiply
the car by the number of cars in the ordi-
nary length of train multiply the train by
the number of trains represented in the
vast yearly business of the road add the

ures equally interesting and here they are

twenty miles an hour was pretty good
time on the old line and never a train toiled
over it without a monster helping engine
at its head by the new way there are no
helper engines and now hours of running

true nevertheless that the cut-off of

  the dimensions which you give are all
wrong for the best results presuming that
your figures for the size of the cylinder
should be reversed viz x instead of
x inches then the stroke is too long the
driving-wheels are too high and the diame-
ter of the boiler is disproportionately large
to its length still in order to give the in-
formation asked regarding horse-power
based on your figures it is necessary to re-
vert to the following formula

of operators and not road crews who come

t a p cleveland ohio-  a freight-

nate them

  	brakemen must begin on freight on
the majority of roads otherwise they can-
not reach the position of conductor in either
freight or passenger service if they start
as passenger trainmen they may in time be-
come collectors or train auditors but as a
rule the only road to the conductors berth
lies through the freight service

these quotations are really of little value as
the scale shifts tremendously dependent on
the section of the country and the strength
of the existing agreements

wt b knoxville tennessee-the

seems to put the blame for the train getting

ror unless in full possession of the material
gathered during the investigation

what is the average heat which is at-
tained in a hot box is there any
device on the market to eliminate the
trouble-h s detroit michigan

  there is no strictly reliable data for this
temperature as it would be largely dependent-
on the composition of the soft metal which
forms the liner for the brass proper and
on which the journal runs the metal ordi-
narily employed for car brasses is specially
hard babbitt

  this will start to run or fuse at about
 degrees f this temperature is of
course abnormally high for a hot box
and would imply a mclted-out brass
the term as you no doubt are aware is
freely applied and may mean only the pack-
ing on fire with the bearing relatively cool
in regard to special devices to minimize
hot-box troubles these are confined to slight
differences in the interior of the journal-
box which encloses the journal of the axle
the journal bearing and key and which holds
the packing for lubricating the journal

  that any one of these departures is any
more serviceable in the long run than the
american railway master mechanics asso-
ciation journal-box which is in general use
is largely speculative the idea  which
these patented devices is based is simply to
keep the oil-soaked packing in more uniform
contact with where it will do the most good

  the best safeguard is of course to give
the boxes the necessary attention which they
fail to receive more than any single item
about the railroad viz see that none of
the lids have been lost allowing dirt to
enter that they contain sufficient packing
to take care of them and that the soft liner

mentioned is not worn down to a point where
the brass itself will run on the journal
without the interposition of an anti-friction
metal ninety per cent we believe of hot-
box troubles arise from lack of care as
the existing appliances arc thoroughly ade-
quate

stroke it would simply serve to distort the
motion by rendering unequal the leads on
either side of the valve and the exhaust
would likely beat out of square

  the maximum travel of the valve is fixed
by the throw of the eccentric which is per-
manently keyed to the shaft and the proper
length of the eccentric-blade is that which
will permit the valve to move an equal dis-
tance  either side of an imaginary line
drawn through the center of the valve-seat
hence the length of the eccentric-blades
should be regarded as really permanent

  they are never changed except to correct
inequalities in the valve travel mentioned
moving the reverse-lever  the quadrant
simply lengthens or shortens the valve travel
 the seat without interfering with the
equality of the travel provided the eccentric-
blades are of the proper length

-h m w milwaukee wisconsin

  your question is much involved and we
doubt if the answer will be exactly what you
arc looking for the confusing feature is
that you have already defined the engines
as one and two horse-power respectively
then of course the second will do twice
the work of the first but if we are to con-
clude that the second engine only develops
two horse-power with two hundred pounds
by the light of the lantern



of steam it is only at half its capacity at
one hundred pounds and both engines are
therefore equal the formula for calcula-
ting horse-power is pressure mean effective
pressure for stroke multiplied by length of
stroke in feet multiplied by area of piston
in square inches multiplied by number of
working strokes per minute and the whole
divided by  the result equaling
horse-power you will thus note that the
pressure is the controlling factor in the
formula as will be readily evinced by work-
ing it out for a number of pressures in
connection with the same engine if this
does not explain let us fiear from you again

total wheel-base of the engine and the total
wheel-base of both engine and tender we
correctly quoted in the february number the
total wheel-base of southern pacific no
 engine and tender at eighty-three feet
six inches as the longest recorded no
doubt your figures viz one hundred and
eleven feet ten and one-half inches for the
corresponding dimensions of santa fe nos
 and  is correct but this does not
imply that no  is not very much longer
than eighty-three feet six inches when the
overhang at each end is reckoned with and
added as a rule the length over all from
the nose of the pilot to the extreme rear por-
tion of the tender frame is difficult to esti-
mate unless of course access may be had

st louis and western railroad-andrew warrington-who was formerly fireman
on his fathers engine he has helped put fred through college and upon his graduation
writes him to call at his office in chicago upon arriving there fred finds warrington
in great trouble it appears that bonds to the extent of  have been stolen from the
safe of the company and the only ones knowing the combination are the treasurer war-
ringtons son who has been lately speculating wildly and the general superintendent him-
self warrington the father has had some differences with henry burbridge the presi-
dent of the company the directors siding with warrington were disposed to compel
burbridge to resign and elect warrington his successor on account of the gambling
and speculating of his son warrington is compelled to suspect him but at the same time
imagines it may be a plot of burbridges and the treasurer stanwood to implicate his son
and thereby discredit him causing him to resign from the company an englishman
montresor who is  friendly terms with warringtons wife and daughter is supposed to
know more than any one about the disappearance of the bonds the proposition made to
fred is that he is to trace the bonds find out who was instrumental in their disappearance
working independently of the detectives already engaged and without communicating in
any way with mr warrington during the time return the bonds within thirtydays it is
a stupendous task mr warrington requests him to call that evening and escort his
daughter louise to the opera as he has reasons to believe that she is going to meet mon-
tresor and he wants fred to be in a position to know all the details instead of going to
the opera louise lias secretly ordered the driver to go to lincoln park here louise
accuses fred of being a spy and tries to escape from the carriage fred follows her and
is accosted by a man who wishes to speak to him privately he follows the man and while
speaking to him receives a blow  the head that knocks him senseless

saw that he was alone the
carriage that had brought him and miss
warrington to this spot had disappeared
as had also montresor and the unseen
man who had struck him down just after
the englishman had assaulted him

  with a low-muttered oath the altoona
man rose from the ground passing a
hand over his hair he found that blood
was issuing from a scalp wound at the
back of his head

   well the old man was right enough
he muttered  montresors trail and
mine have crossed my eyes were closed
however and he got me foul and now
andrew warringtons enemy is mine un-
til i get this fellow montresor on his back
his trail and mine are one

  retreating farther into the shadow of
the clump of trees he seated himself on
a rock and leaning back he clasped his
hands over one of his knees

  now where do i begin he mused

  frederick erskine came of good old
fighting stock and the most dangerous
fighter always is the one who keeps his
head though anger still smoldered
dully in his eyes the young man made a
determined effort to review the situation
calmly this was difficult at first for it
was only gradually that he recovered
from the effect of the blow that had ren-
dered him unconscious

  he asked himself how it had come to
pass that montresor so soon had recog-
nized him as an enemy then he remem-
bered that it had been louise who had
first revealed the fact that his relations
with her father were known to others
how had she come to believe that he was
a spy

  in a short time the situation grew clear-
er to him louise had entered the library
while warrington was in the act of giving
him the photograph of montresor and
this fact doubtless had excited suspicions
which she had communicated to montre-
sor either by telephone or a special mes-
senger

  this theory was in some degree veri-
fied by the manner in which montresor
had demanded the surrender of the pho-
tograph with a more rapidly beating
heart the young man thrust a hand into
the inner pocket of his coat the photo-
graph was gone but this was not all he
had lost

  he had been robbed of the envelope
containing the three thousand dollars
which had been given to him by warring-
ton 

  bewildered baffled and thoroughly un-
strung by the suddenness with which this
series of unfortunate incidents had oc-
curred erskine rose weakly and looked
ahead of him with unseeing eyes for sev-
eral minutes he stood motionless then
with shuffling stumbling steps he issued
from the clump of trees and followed the
course of the roadway

  he had proceeded only a few paccs
when he came to a drinking-fountain for
horses there with shaking hands he
washed his wound  then after drying it
with his handkerchief he continued on
in the direction of the lake front

  frederick erskine was young and this
was the first time in his life that he had
come face to face with a heavy respon-

sibility he knew now that young as he
was the turning-point of his whole career
was reached though he loathed the task
that had been forced upon him it was im-
possible for him to shirk it

  for years he and his father had been
under obligations to andrew warrington
and now warrington in distress had ap-
pealed to him for aid he had under-
taken to recover the bonds and hopeless
as seemed the task he must do so be-
sides all this lie had an account of his
own to settle with charles montresor

  but where was montresor to be found
it now occurred to him that in view of
his loss of the three thousand dollars
which had been given to him by war-
rington he would have to draw on his
own funds for several days at least in
another week perhaps he might achieve
something which would enable him to
confess his loss to warrington with a bet-
ter grace

   as this thought came to him he halted
suddenly the extent of his own funds
consisted of little more than a hundred
dollars which he had carried in a card-
case in one of the pockets of his vest to
this pocket he raised his hand instinct-
ively

  this too had been taken from him
while he lay unconscious in a pocket
of his trousers were several silver coins
however and clutching these he resumed
his way with quickened steps

   fair means or foul  he muttered
repeating warringtons injunction
 well the first blow in the fight was
struck by montresor and it was foul
more than this the man already has
proved himself to be a diief if it takes
a rogue to catch a rogue ill learn his
game and play it i have my orders and
im going to take the old man at his word
by fair means or by foul im going to
land those bonds-and montresor 

  walking on now with steady steps
erskine began to formulate a plan of ac-
tion it was doubtful whether he could
find montresor again without dogging the
step of louise warrington well he
would do this then beautiful as sjie
was she had lost his respect and had in-
spired his resentment from this moment
on he would work only in the interests of
her father but in order to do this he
would require funds he must write to


the railroad mans magazine

warrington and tell him of the misad-
venture that had befallen him

  upon leaving the park the young man
boarded a car which took him to his hotel
arriving there he wrote a lettr to an-
drew warrington describing briefly what
had happened this he despatched by a
messenger to warringtons residence in
an hour he had his answer

  from an envelope erskine drew a sheet
of paper in which were enclosed ten one-
hundred-dollar bank-notes on the sheet
of paper was written the following note

  dear belleville 

    enclosed herewith find  when
  you require more inform me of the fact
  at once but spare me all accounts of
  your troubles i desire no explanations
  get to work and keep your confidences
  to yourself burn this note at once

  the note was unsigned erskine ap-
plied a lighted match to it and then
dropped it into an ash-receiver when
the paper was consumed he left the room
and summoned a cab

   lake shore drive he said as he pre-
pared to step into the vehicle

  what number asked the driver

   put me down at the beginning of the
drive directed erskine  but get there
as quickly as you can

 when the lake shore drive was
reached erskine directed the driver to
turn into a street about half a block south
of the warrington residence and there
await his coming then when the cab
moved off he walked deliberately along
by the sea-wall until he arrived opposite
the street in which he saw the cab drawn
up at the spot which he had indicated

  assured that the cabman was acting in
accordance with his instructions erskine
retraced his steps for a little distance
then glancing around to satisfy himself
that he was unobserved he climbed over
the sea-wall and dropped down to the
beach

  as has been said the night was moon-
less and the stars which before had been
visible now were obscured from view by
a mist which for the last half-hour had
been drifting over the lake and settling
down over the city a faint breeze was
stirring and this was charged with the
dampness of the great lake over which it
had swept

  finding a large boulder near him er-

skine was about to seat himself upon it
and was in the act of drawing his cigar-
case from his pocket when he heard in
the distance the deep sonorous stroke of
a bell this stroke was followed by oth-
ers and when he had counted eleven they
ceased

   eleven oclock he mused  if she
has not already returned she-

  he started suddenly as he became con-
scious of the fact that in the air about him
was the odor of tobacco-smoke he had
been gazing abstractedly into the dark-
ness that lay over the lake but now he
turned abruptly to his left there he saw
something that was moving slowly toward
him

  it was the faint glow of a lighted cigar

chapter vi
the man behind the cigar

another signal eh erskine
muttered  shall i run it or
slow down 

  to his ears now came the soft meas-
ured crunching of gravel and the sound
warned him that in the darkness it would
be difficult for him to make a noiseless
retreat he decided therefore to remain
where he was

  the cigar which erskine already had
taken from his case was between his teeth
he drew a match across the boulder on
which he was seated and raised it to the
weed

  the sound of crunching gravel ceased
and the glow of the cigar became station-
ary keeping an eye over his left shoul-
der erskine lighted his own cigar and
waited

   damp evening the young man said

  there was no reply but a moment later
the gravel crunched again and the glow-
ing tip of the cigar drew nearer

   who the deuce are you  growled the
stranger

  erskine hesitated the voice was
heavier than montresors and he won-
dered if it was that of the man who had
struck him after he had received the blow
from the englishman

   well its a little dark for the ex-
change of cards just now im afraid
he said

  again the stranger halted if youre
without lights



one of them im talkin you for i guess
youre pretty much at home in dark
places the newcomer retorted

 indeed erskine exclaimed
 would it be too much for me to ask who
it is that you take me to be

   oh one of montresors tribe i sup-
pose replied the other surlily

   then you are not a friend of mon-
tresors i take it said erskine puffing
thoughtfully at his cigar

  with a muttered curse the stranger
slouched slowly past erskine who watch-
ing him warily retained his seat on the
boulder

   dont be in a hurry the young man
protested as the other was in the act of
moving away the stranger halted

   what has caused you to think i am
a friend of montresors erskine asked

  well you know him dont ye
asked the man who spoke in the tone of
one who expected an affirmative answer

  for a moment erskine hesitated was
this man an enemy of the englishmans
or was he one of his confederates if
he was an enemy it might be possible to
use him to advantage if he was a con-
federate erskine wanted to see him in
the light if he were not dissembling it
was plain that he had some grievance
against montresor and that he had some
reason to suspect that montresor or his
friends had some object in lurking in the
vicinity of the warrington house

   i met montresor for the firsts time to-
night erskine answered quietly  the
meeting was quite accidental on my part
however and i will frankly confess that
it was not altogether to my liking from
the way you have spoken of him i should
judge that you know rather more of him
than i do

   if you have a grudge against him
im in a mood to help you to get even
if you can persuade me hat e really isnt
a bad fellow why then perhaps-

   youre ina mood- to help me to get
even hey muttered the stranger
thoughtfully well i hadnt thought
anything about tryin to get even and it
wouldnt do me no good as far as  can
see snake-killin aint in my line when
theres better business to be done whats
montresor done to you

  oh he and one of his friends
knocked me out and robbed me of a tidy

bunch of money-thats all erskine an-
swered carelessly

   robbed ye of a tidy bunch of
money exclaimed the stranger and
there was a note of incredulity in his
voice   guess youre just a little bit
off on that aint ye mister montresor
is about as rank a scoundrel as ever wore
the devils brand but highway robbery-
well  reckon hell sort of keep above that
for a while-if he can where did it
happen 

   in lincoln park

   when was it mister 

   to-night

  the stranger drew nearer erskine as
he asked  you was walkin through the
park 

    i had been riding in a carriage but i
had a disagreement with the person with
whom i had been sitting and i ot out
as the carriage moved away montresor
and a companion attacked me and did
me up when  recovered consciousness
my money was gone

   the deuce it was  the stranger mut-
tered  then after a pause he added
 well mister you aint the only one
montresor robbed to-night

   what do you mean  demanded er-
skine vainly striving to see the outlines
of the others face in the darkness

    mean lie robbed me of my job
the stranger answered sullenly

  indeed what kind of a job was
that

   until two hours ago i was coachman
for mr warrington

  erskine started  you were the coach-
man of andrew warrington he ex-
claimed

   yes sir sighed the man

  erskine rose slowly from the boulder
on which he had been sitting  then
you drove the carriage from which i
stepped only a moment before montresor
assaulted me he said

   hey what do you mean by that
the stranger muttered

    mean that the carriage from which
i stepped was mr andrew warring-
tons

   there aint no carriage or horse of
mr warringtons left his place to-
night

   come come my man-youre wrong
a t half past seven-


the railroad mans magazine

   at half past seven oclock to-night
mr warringtons carriage with me on
the box was in front of the house waitin
to take miss warrington to the audito-
rium but miss warrington werent
there shed gone off in another rig what
drove up before and then- but lord
love us mister-you aint the gentleman
-the gentleman mr warrington said
went with her instead of him it werent
miss warrington you had that disagree-
ment with before you left that carriage 
 yes erskine answered shortly

   where is she now  asked the stran-
ger in a voice that shook a little

   she drove oft while i was being at-
tacked by montresor

   how did you know it was montresor
sir 

   i had his picture in my pocket but
now let me know a little more of your-
self you have been discharged by mr
warrington you say 

   yes sir-after servin him for twelve
years

   why did he discharge you 

   because i had been takin miss war-
ringtons orders too faithful-drivin her
to houses of montresors friends without
tellin mr warrington afterward and
sometimes takin messages from her to
montresor

   where did you deliver those messages
to montresor 

   sometimes he or some of his friends
would wait for them here

   do you know where he lives

   no sir hes too foxy to let any one
know- that i dont believe that even
miss warrington knows where montre-
sor lives

  there was a pause then erskine
asked  miss warrington seems to be
pretty fond of this fellow montresor
does she not  

   why i cant say much as to that
sir returned the other doubtfully  she
meets him pretty often and she sends him
letters but somehow when they are to-
gether shes as cold as ice to him and hes
the only one i ever saw her snappish to
shes a fine young lady sir and what use
she could find fer a feller like montre-
sor  never could quite figure out he
paused  then speaking abstractedly he
added  theres something queer about
the thing and no mistake sir-but theres

something that makes me think that miss
warrington has little likin for that
sneakin englishman

  for a minute neither spoke erskine
was the first to break the silence

   from the way you have spoken i
should judge that you were well disposed
to miss warrington he said

   id fight a dozen husky chaps at once
at a single word from her sir replied
the former coachman  then after a pause
he growled  and if i didnt lick em
theyd have to take me away in an under-
takers wagon for id die without a
whimper if  thought i was savin her
from enemies

   whats your name my friend er-
skine asked

   barney mcgrane sir

   whatwere your wages while you were
working for mr warrington

   forty dollars a month

   i will give you fifty

   what to do sir 

   to help me land this infernal scoun-
drel montresor 

  mcgrane hesitated  perhaps you are
a detective he said doubtfully

  not a professional detective but it
is my purpose to do a little detective work
on my own account for the next two or
three weeks and montresor is the man
i am after

   you are going to get back your money
if you can 

   no im afraid the three thousand
will have to go by the board montresor
has got away with a far bigger sum than
that-a lot of bonds that belong to a
friend of mine those are what i am
seeking now and i think that you can
aid me in my effort to recover them in-
cidentally  think that between us we
will be able to get miss warrington out
of the clutches of montresor for it
seems clear enough that he has some sort
of hold over her will you help me
 well i dont know sir mcgrane
replied doubtfully  how long have
you known miss warrington

   i met her for the first time to-night
 and mr warrington knew that you
were going with her to the auditorium
said mcgrane thoughtfully

   yes i have known mr warrington
for several years

   well thats good enough for me
without lights



mcgrane replied  mr warrington
wouldnt have et her go off with you if
he didnt think you was all right but
what was it that you and miss warring-
ton disagreed about 

   montresor

   then she was going to meet him in
the park thats the reason she had that
other rig call for her before i had time
to get around

    it looks like it barney

   im with you sir when do you
want me to begin

   right now

   what am i to do 

   you are to follow implicitly all in-
structions that i may give you more-
over as i am pledged to secrecy in this
affair you are to ask me for no explana-
tions other than those which may be nec-
essary to enable us to work in harmony
with one another will you agree to
this 

    yes sir

   let us shake hands on it then

  as their hands met in the darkness mc-
grane started and drew back suddenly

    get your heel on that cigar he whis-
pered

   what is it   erskine asked as he
dropped his lighted cigar to the ground
and placed his foot upon it

   hark 

  then the young railroad man heard it
too-the low-speaking voice of an ad-
vancing man

   its some of the montresor crowd
whispered mcgrane as he laid a hand
on one of the arms of his companion
 this is one of their meeting - places
lets move  a bit until they stop

chapter vii
on the shoals of indecision

vfith a more rapidly beating pulse
erskine turned to the left and
followed by his companion he moved
cautiously along the beach in the same
direction in which the unseen newcom-
ers were proceeding at length he halt-
ed abruptly as the hand of mcgrane
clutched his sleeve

   wait  whispered mcgrane  they
have stopped where we were standing

  as tfrskine listened he found that the

sounds of voices and footsteps had sud-
denly ceased

    want to hear what theyre sayin -
asked mcgrane after a pause

   yes lets get a little closer to
them erskine answered

    where the devils the boat  a voice
only a few paces distant asked querulous-
ly

  erskine and mcgrane instinctively
sank to their hands and knees mcgrane
tapped his companion twice  the shoul-
der

    es-yes erskine whispered

  both had recognized the voice of mon
tresor

    im afraid that youre going a bit too
far this time monty growled another
voice

   have to do it slevin montresor
replied in a tone of gloomy conviction

   the fools streak of yellow is growing
so strong that every hour finds him more
dangerous its ten to one that he will
blow the whole thing to the old man be-
fore the night is over the girl half sus-
pects the truth already and if she learns
it all there will be hades to pay

    but she played into your hands all
right to-night monty protested the oth-
er in shaking accents

    she had to montresor retorted sav
agely  she failed to meet me afterward
however and for the last three days it
has looked to me as if she had the bit be-
tween her teeth the way she gave the
old man the slip to-night is going to bring
them into another clash that is likely to
be the worst she has had with him

    well she weathered all the others
slevin said

    in a way she did but it seeitfs to me
that he already has her on the run its
clear enough that she let something out
of the bagif she hasnt how does it
happen that the old man has hit my trail
how did it happen that that fool sleuth
had my photograph in his pocket why
did the old man send him off with her
in some manner or other he got wind of
the fact that she was to meet me some-
where and lie wanted the sleuth to get a
line on me and follow me if lie could
oh the game was plain enough

   to the ears of the listeners there came
the sounds of several muttered words
which however were unintelligible a


the railroad mans magazine

long pause followed then the man who
had been addressed as slevin spoke

   the inter-states got the paper  he
asked

   yes

   but it doesnt deliver at tacoma

   it transfers to the dale at wapiti
falls if we leave at six we can beat it
out

  there was another pause then slevin
asked

   are all the eggs in one basket  

   all in the machine-box but why in
the deuce doesnt the boat-

   hark  slevin exclaimed in a voice
that barely reached the ears of erskine
and his companion who though they lis-
tened intently failed to hear the sound
or sounds that had startled the speaker

  for a moment all avas still then er-
skine and mcgrane heard the sounds of
retreating footsteps

  whats the game whispered mc-
grane

   hush   erskine cautioned

  from out of the darkness that con-
cealed the waters of the lake came the
low measured click of oarlocks a mo-
ment later two low whistles sounded from
the beach these were answered by two
whistles from the unseen boat then all
was still

   come-lets follow them erskine
muttered

  they had taken only a few steps how-
ever when they were brought to a stand-
still by the sudden flare of a match about
fifty paces in front of them

   theyve stopped said erskine quiet-
ly  if we-

  startled by the sounds of quick foot-
steps near the sea-wall above him er
skine allowed the rest of the sentence to
die upon his lips

  though the beach was so dark that it
was impossible for erskine to see the
features of his companion the light from
a lamp on the drive enabled him to see
the outlines of the face of a man who now-
leaned over the wall

  mcgrane grasped the arm of his com-
panion

   joe warrington  he exclaimed in a
warning voice

  moving quickly closer to the wall er-
skine and mcgrane watched the man who
was bending over it

  for a moment warrington seemed to
hesitate then with a rapid movement
he swung himself over the wall and down
to the beach

  a score of warning voices now seemed
to be sounding in erskines ears not
for a moment did he doubt that the men
whose voices he had heard were medita-
ting some act of foul play against the
young man who was preparing to meet
them

  it was essential that young warring-
ton should be warned but how was this
to be done without revealing the fact that
the words of montresor and his compan-
ion had been overheard

   if the nature of this conversation was
revealed to warrington would he give
the story credence if this should not
be sufficient to shake his faith in mon-
tresor was it not probable that he would
acquaint the englishman with the fact
that his conversation had been overheard 
if he did this there might yet be time
to effect some change in the plans which
had been partly disclosed by the conver-
sation in the darkness

  and so fred erskine found himself on
the shoals of indecision he must decide
quickly and he must stand or fall by rea-
son of the action which with only a few
moments for reflection he must now de-
cide to take

  joe warringtons feet had scarcely
touched  the gravel of the beach when
erskine strode quickly toward him

  young warrington hearing the sounds
of his steps turned sharply

  montresor he queried in a low
voice

   yes-montresor erskine answered
in a low tense voice

  scarcely had the altoona man spoken
when his right fist shot out and crash-
ing against the side of warringtons head
sent him reeling to the wall quickly
following his staggering victim erskine
struck him two more blows that felled
him to the ground where he lay uncon-
scious

  a hoarsely muttered oath behind him
caused him to turn suddenly and a mo-
ment later he dodged a blow which mc-
grane aimed at his head

    what devils game is this youre play-
ing demanded the astonished coach-
man
without lights



   hush  commanded erskine and as
he spoke he gripped mcgranes wrists

  it was in vain that the coachman
strained every muscle to regain his lib-
erty

   whats your game you infernal-
mcgrane began

  stop it erskine muttered we
have no time for explanations and you
promised to ask for none we have saved
this mans life and it is now up to both
of us to keep him from losing something
that is still more valuable he will re-
cover presently and when he does we
must see to it that he believes that he was
struck down by montresor

  from the point at which the flare of
the match had been seen only a moment
before came the sound of a low whistle
erskine and mcgrane stood silently be-
side the inanimate body of joe warring-
ton

  at length the whistle was repeated
then erskine heard the sound of advan-
cing footsteps

  you there joe came a voice

   steer him off directed erskine ad-
dressing mcgrane  tell him it was you
who just came over the wall

  the coachman muttered something un-
der his breath then after a brief hesita
tion he advanced slowly to meet the un-
seen speaker

   i aint the man youre after mr
montresor mcgrane said doggedly

   what the devil are you doing here
mcgrane  

   same as you i guess the coachman
growled

   did any one send you here 

   no i aint takin no orders from no
one to-night

   was that you who just got over the
wall  

   i couldnt have got down here with-
out gettin over the wall the coachman
grumbled

    all right barney returned the other
more civilly than he had spoken before

   are ye lookin for young- mr war
rington the coachman asked

   no-no-not particularly montre-
sor answered quickly  ive met him
here before you know and i-

   yes-i know mcgrane answered
bitterly

   well good night barney-

  the coachman made no reply er-
skine listening intently heard the sounds
of retreating footsteps as these died
away mcgrane slowly returned to where
his companion awaited him

   now what does all this mean sir
the coachman asked

  it means- erskine began and
stopped

  from that part of the beach toward
which montresor had retreated came a
low scraping sound and a sullen mut-
tering voice this was followed by a
silence which was broken at last by the
click of oarlocks

    it means that the body of this young
man will not be weighted and dropped
overboard from that boat to-night fred
erskine finished

chapter viii

the philosophy of ananias

a low groan followed by a faint
clattering of stones indicated that
the prostrate man was stirring

    now keep your head barney and let
me do the talking cautioned erskine as
he knelt down beside warrington

    all right sir the coachman assented
gruffly

  as joe warrington rose to his elbow
erskines hand fell on his shoulders

  are you feeling better now the
man from altoona asked

   wrho-what has happened  faltered
the bewildered victim of the assault
then as his thoughts grew clearer he
asked sharply   is that you montresor

    no it is not montresor but a friend
erskine answered dryly

	 but it was montresor who-

   yes-yes-it was montresor who put
you where you are explained erskine
who acting on the theory that the end
would justify the means found fiction
better adapted to his purpose than truth

  with an oat-h young warrington rose
 well who are you  he asked

   there are two of us erskine an-
swered  i am a stranger to you the
man who is with me is barney mcgrane

 mcgrane   warrington exclaimed

   yes sir spoke up the coachman
 your father was just after firin me
when i picked up with this here gentle-


the railroad mans magazine

man and he had the kindness to offer me
a job of-

   of helping me drive off the chaps
who had just assaulted you put in
erskine quickly  if it wasnt for the
assistance of mcgrane your friend mon-
tresor and two or three others of his
kind would have had you in a boat that
put off from the shore just before you
recovered consciousness

  they put off in a boat muttered
warrington wonderingly

   yes before you were assaulted
however i overheard a little of a conver-
sation that they had here on the beach
from what they said i had some reason
to believe that they distrusted you and
thought it best to put you out of the way
 they did eh  growled young war-
rington then after a pause he added
 was that all you heard 

  no i heard enough to cause me to
understand that if you dont make a
prompt and vigorous effort to get out
of the trap into which they have led you
it would have been much better for you if
you had remained in their hands and been
cast overboard after they had rowed you
well out into the lake

   you mean that i would be better
dead 

   exactly

   then i am afraid that i have small
reason to thank you for getting me out of
their hands said warrington gloomily

   on the contrary i think i may earn
at least a small measure of your grati-
tude for i believe that i can put you in
the way of saving something that should
be more valuable to you than your life

   indeed and what is that 

   your honor-and your fathers

  for a while the silence was unbroken
then in a hoarser voice young warring-
ton asked

   what do you mean 

   the return of certain valuable bonds
which recently disappeared from a place
to which you had access

  again a silence fell erskine heard
the heavy breathing of the man he was
addressing

   you know too much warrington
grumbled

  it is little enough erskine answered
easily  still i think that with the
knowledge that i have obtained i will

have little difficulty in running down the
men i am after and restoring the bonds
to the place from which they were ta-
ken

  you are a detective warrington
asked

 no i am a special agent of a per-
son who is scarcely less interested than
you are in the restoration of the bonds
there was another pause then war-
rington asked

   in whose interests are you working 
   in your own

   who has employed you

   i cannot tell you

  a muttered oath fell from warring-
tons lipsand he addressed the coachman
 barney who is this man  he demand-
ed

   never heard his name in my life but
i think lies right when he says hes a
friend of yours sir replied mcgrane
dubiously

   did you hear any of the talk that this
gentleman says he overheard barney-
montresors talk about getting me out
of the way  joe asked

   a little of it sir but no names was
mentioned and i didnt suspect that it
was you they was puttin up a job 
the coachman replied

  joe muttered something in an under-
tone and began to move slowly in the di-
rection in which montresor had retreated
erskine stepped quickly after him and
laid a restraining hand  his arm

   it will be better if you should give
me your confidence mr warrington
erskine said quietly

  joe turned quickly  no confound
you ill give no man my confidence-
after what has happened to-night he
growled  if what you and mcgrane
have said is true ive got a bone to pick
with montresor and the sooner i get to
work the better

   true erskine assented  and if
you can be made to understand that your
interests and mine are one in this affair
you will learn that you can work better
with my aid than without it

  warringtons hand fell heavily  er-
skines shoulder and shook it angrily

  come now-speak out he ex-
claimed  what kind of game is this
youre playing you say you have saved
me from montresor and in return you
without lights



demand my confidence why you ap-
pear to be an absolute stranger to me
what interest have you then in my af-
fairs 

   i am interested in your affairs only
so far as they have to do with mine less
than twelve hours ago i applied for a po-
sition in the service of the c s l and
w i was told that my employment by
the company was conditional upon my
ability to recover the bonds which disap-
peared five days ago from the office of
the companys treasurer i have under
taken to restore these bonds to the place
from which they were taken and i will
do so-with or without your aid

   you have a line on them i suppose
said warrington sarcastically

   if i had not a line on them i should
scarcely have appeared here so oppor-
tunely for you to-night answered er-
skine shortly  if you want me to fight
you as well as montresor im ready to
take on the game if you will aid me in
getting those bonds back to the vault in
such a manner that no one will know how
they got there you will have everything
to gain and nothing to lose

   you mean that you will cause them to
be returned by stealth  exclaimed the
astonished warrington

  exactly

   but how 

   that will be your affair

   you mean that you will give the
bonds to me 

   conditionally-yes

   and what are the conditions 

   there is only one the bonds must
be returned to the vault in ray presence
and when this is done you must leave the
place with me

   after which you will report that you
found me with the goods joe retorted
skeptically

   no so long as the missing bonds
are returned to the place from which
they were taken it matters not to me who
was responsible for their disappearance
if they are not returned within thirty
days the exposure and punishment of the
thief must follow

   am i to understand then that if
the bonds are returned within thirty days
no effort will be made to expose or pun-
ish the man who took them from the
vault

   yes you are to understand just
that

  for a moment young warrington was
silent then in a voice that shook a little
he said 

   you have been assigned to this case
by my father 

   i have told you that i am working in
the interest of your father-and yours
that is all that i can tell you now
again warrington hesitated  you
have said that you have a line on the
bonds he returned  io you mean
that you know in whose possession they
are now  

    yes

   you suspect that montresor has
them 

  no i know that they are not in the
possession of montresor erskine an-
swered quietly

   not in the possession of montresor 
exclaimed warrington with some sharp-
ness

   no he parted with them to-day a
few days hence he will have them again
unless-

   unless- put in warrington eag-
erly

   unless they fall into our hands
erskine explained

   and you think that-that you-
faltered young warrington

   i have told you that i would get
them erskine answered firmly  am
i to have you with me or against me  
joe hesitated for a moment then he
turned to the coachman who standing
apart from the others was ignorant of
the subject of their conversation

   mcgrane you have said that my
father discharged you from his service
to-night he said  what was his rea-
son for doing so  

  and now it was the coachmans turn
to hesitate  because i disobeyed his
orders he replied

   was that disobedience in regard to
any matter that had to do with me

   no sir but it had to do with mr
montresor

  with montresor

   yes sir-mr montresor and miss
warrington mr warrington told me
to report to him whenever i drove miss
warrington to houses at which i had
reason to believe she met mr montresor


the railroad mans magazine

miss warrington told me not to do so

i did as she told me sir and so dis-
 ibeyed mr warrington to-night he
found me out and then he fired me

  the words that fell from the lips of
young warrington were so low as to be
unintelligible for a moment no one
spoke then j oe said 

   it served you right mcgrane

   i think it did sir replied the
coachman penitently

  speaking huskily young warrington
addressed erskine  does my father
suspect that-that i- he faltered and
stopped

   he has not said so the altoona
man replied

   do you think it would be better for
me to go to him  joe asked

   no under the circumstances i
think it would be better to give your con-
fidence to me

  in the darkness erskine felt a trem-
bling hand close around his own  you
shall have it then but not here he an-
swered in a low voice

  erskine knew that his relation to the
elder warrington was suspected but
that what joseph warrington had to tell
him was not for the ears of barney mc-
grane in the game that was to be
played however the coachman must
have a part but he must be kept in ig-
norance of its full significance

  erskine thought quickly  i have a
carriage waiting only a few steps from
here he said  follow me to it but
keep well behind me what we do must

to be co

be done quickly the trail is hot to-
night and by the time the sun is up two
of us must be several hundred miles from
here

  as he finished speaking erskine clam-
bered to the top of the sea-wall a mo-
ment later he had disappeared

   barney did you ever meet that chap
anywhere before to-night joe asked as
he and the coachman prepared to mount
the wall

    never sir but theres something about
him that makes me feel as how hes like
to prove a good friend of you and mr
warrington

   did he see my father this evening 
 yes sir and mr warrington told
him to take miss warrington to the
opera but miss warrington got him into
a carriage that was sent by montresor
and a few minutes later montresor laid
that fellow out in lincoln park that
shows i guess that montresor knows
hes dangerous and is afraid that he-
with an exclamation of pain and
amazement the coachman started back
then with a loud hoarse cry of rage
he grappled with a dark body that
had flung itself upon him in the dark-
ness a keen pain darted through his
left shoulder andx a moment later his
sinewy thumbs sank deep into the yield-
ing flesh of a human throat but it was
not from that throat that issued the long-
drawn shriek that reached the ears of
erskine and caused him to halt abrupt-
ly on the sidewalk on the other side of
the lake shore drive

  a night in the r p o

by willard d eakin

perhaps the most romantic but at the same time the most difficult
position on the cars behind the steam-horse is that of mail-clerk
especially if it be a cold windy night and the train is making up time
in this article the author has described just such a run on the  line and bill
r p o it took half a dozen engineers to make the trip but the mail-clerks
had to stick it out talk of cold and hunger- just light the pipe and hook
onto this yarn

what one man encountered sticking letters and throwing papers in
a fifteen hours run on a car with a broken coupling
fourteen hours late

i

t is a long run from lincoln to
billings and we mail-weigh-
ers and the colored pullman
porters were the only ones
who made it it took five
or six engineers to cover the
trip and there were three division points
where the conductors and brakemen
changed

  edgemont south dakota divided the
 east end  from the  west end  of
the  line and bill r p o and here
the weary mail-clerk who had been stick-
ing letters and throwing papers through-
out the fifteen hours run from lincoln
gave over his responsibilities to a fresh
clerk who would carry the run on
through to billings

  but we weighers went  at two in
the afternoon in the yards at lincoln
where the mail-car stood until train 
took it out of town at six and we were
on duty during the thirty-four hours un-
til we reached billings at midnight the
second night out that was when we

were scheduled to arrive but we were
often so late that our twenty-hour lay-
over in billings was greatly shortened
as one old weigher expressed it we fre-
quently  nearly met ourselves coming
back

  everything went wrong  this par-
ticular trip in the first place when we
went to our car that day we found an
old-time-r with oil lamps and no steam
from the engine taking the place of one
of our modern cars which had been
burned up in a recent wreck at aurora

  vve were in the habit of bringing
along bacon and eggs or similar raw
materials for our meals during the thirty-
hour run depending upon the little gas-
stove with which each modern car is
equipped to cook them

  without the stove the prospect was
that we would have a serious famine be-
fore reaching billings for the most
edible article in our grub-boxes was raw
eggs then it was in february and the
prospect of keeping the atmosphere at




the railroad mans magazine

a comfortable temperature was not en-
couraging

  at germantown the first station out
of lincoln the engineer started up too
suddenly for the fourteen cars he was
hauling and broke the front draw-bar of
our car then they fastened us onto the
rear end with a chain and as  always
ran local on the east end we had an in-
teresting though not pleasant series of
sudden stops and starts

some work to cook

  that night we managed to boil some
potatoes and eggs by hanging a bucket
inside of the baker heater but in doing
this we used up all of our kindling to
make the fire hot enough and during
the night the fire went out while the
clerk and i were working at the far end
of the car

  at grand island we laid over eight
hours while the track was being cleared
of a freight wreck and the next day at
three we plowed into a blizzard at alli-
ance breakfastless dinnerless cold and
without kindling

  the clerk had been  duty for near-
ly forty-eight hours having taken a
friends run for him and as he had to
double back at edgemont with only an
hours lay over he decided h could
sleep if he couldnt eat so he made up
his cot on the rack and rolled in

  as the r m s had lost its romance
and become a sad reality he viewed
with  alarm the prospect of being dis-
charged from the service and therefore
had  hesitation about allowing me to
work the mail over his  slip thus ta-
king the responsibility of my errors

  as soon as he decided to sleep i
initiated myself as a mail-clerk being
glad of the opportunity to get the ex-
perience and hoping that having some-
thing to do would make me forget my
hunger and the cold

on the job

  so while he snored away in his im-
provised berth on the paper - rack i
worked the local from station to station
exchanged pouches weighed them  on 
and  off and recording the results on
my weight blanks at crawford i got a

jacketed  register wrote it up in the
book over the clerks signature and
chucked it into the  chey and spoke 
pouch

  the oil lamps had begun to play out
and by this time only one little flicker-
ing flame was left at the upper left cor-
ner of the letter-case by its light i got
crawford tied out with numb fingers
from the station-agent there i got some
oil to replenish my lights but did not
have time to fill the lamps

  between crawford and edgemont
there were two  catch stations where
the pouches were hooked in from a
crane by the catching device in the mail-
car door

  such a station is not viewed with very
much joy by a mail-clerk at any time
and they would be especially hard for
me to make that night we were four-
teen cars away from the engine and ow-
ing to the wind it was impossible to hear
the whistles indicating our approach to
the stations

  it was necessary therefore to keep a
constant lookout for the lights these
could not be seen far through the stormy
night and i had to keep both side doors
open and cross to each one every few
minutes

at catch stations

  the wind had been blowing in for some
time  happened across a package in the
mails with one end open and strange to
say it contained a thermometer i took
this out and found that it registered four
above zero

  i was soon chilled to the bone the
wind swept cinders and fine hard snow
through the big open doors

  i did not know which side the crane
was on at ardmore the first of the
catch stations but as  remembered that
there was only a station-house and a
water-tank in the town both of them at
a safe distance from the track i tied
one catcher in place before we reached
the crane while i was crossing the car
to raise the other catcher arm the pouch
slammed into my trap and ardmore was
off my mind

but at dewey the other catch station

i couldnt do this inly three days before
i had seen a catcher arm straightened
a night in the r p o



back alongside the car from having
hooked into the dewey coal-shed

  that coal-shed was the bane of the
mail-clerks life on the  line and bill
setting so close to the track that the mail-
car could not pass it with the catcher arm
raised and so near the
crane that the arm had
to be raised the moment
the shed was passed it
made dewey the hardest
catch on the run

  i had to keep an
almost constant lookout
ahead for dewey as she
would whiz past and
disappear into the
stormy darkness behind

it was an hours run
from ardmore i knew
by schedule but against
the storm we were not
making anything like
schedule time

  when i had waited
an hour during which
time i took advantage of
the opportunity to fix up
my lights i had no way
of telling how much
longer it would take to
get there so i stood in
the door and strained my
eyes for a yellow light
waist-high and close be-
side the track

  thus another half
hour passed by but only
some red and green
switch-lights were seen

as  had never given
any notice to these be-
fore i was unable to
identify them and so de-
termine where we were

but as i knew that there
would be no others
within at least a mile or
two of them those of
dewey would not show
up for a few minutes and i left tlie door
to consult the rear shack

  as i unbolted the front door of the
car and opened it a blinding swirl of
snow and wind nearly carried me off the
platform as i stepped across the clear
space that the chain allowed between the

two cars i stepped over the iron gate
into the vestibule of the pullman and
found the brakeman asleep in the smo-
king-room

  where are we i asked when i
had succeeded in waking him

   well now how do you suppose i
know he said  when ive been asleep
for the last half-hour

  i told him about the switch-lights but
he couldnt identify them from my de-
scription so i clambered back into the
mail-car and resumed my watch

the engineer started up too suddenly


the railroad mans magazine

where are we  asked when
 had succeeded in waking him

  we were fourteen hours late and run-
ning hard to make up time if i leaned
out and got my ear to the proper angle
there came now and then a feeble grunt
from somewhere up ahead through the
storm seemingly miles away which might
or might not be the whistle of the engine

cold and mighty hungry

  that the engine was ahead was made
clear by the fusillade of cinders that
pelted me in the face my eyes inflamed
and smarted as if they were freezing
with the lids held open  could feel
my limbs getting blue and stiff and the
flapping of the thin trousers against them
in the wind made a friction which  re-
member seemed welcome for the warm-
ing sensation it gave

  several times i felt that i had reached
the limit of physical endurance but i
was determined to make that catch or
freeze in the attempt though i was so
hungry that i wondered whether i would
freeze or starve first

   this mental pro-
 cess was performed
 with a smile that
 seemed to crack my
 frost-stiffened face
 but just when i had
 decided to give it up
 and close the doors
 after taking a last
 hard look ahead the
 light of the crane
 burst out of the
 storm fairly upon
 me i had just time
 to raise the catcher
 w h e n the pouch
 slammed into it

   my troubles were
 not over but it was
 good to have the
 doors shut again
 and after running
 up and down the car
 to get warm 
 clawed through the
 local for edge-
 mont got her tied
 out and awakened
 the clerk just as we
 were pulling in to
 that station

 twenty - four hours without food or
sleep blue and chattering with the cold
i was pessimistic enough to predict that
the  west-end  clerk knowing nothing
of our situation and counting on the regu-
lar steam-heated car with its gas-stove
would have only potatoes bacon and
eggs in his grub-box my pessimism was
proven except that he had steak instead
of the eggs

 but a ray of hope came to me when
i heard the brakeman say as he passed
our door going up ahead something about
turning the mail-car

 they were going to turn us around and
couple us up with the good draw-bar at
the other end of the car so as to dispense
with the chain connection

hustling for grub

   i reported the happy prospect to the
clerk asking the significant question how
long it would probably take to turn the
car around in the hope that he would
make the prospect even more happy
a night in the r p 



    good idea he said  and if youre
so all-fired hungry as you say you are
why not run up-town while theyre turn-
ing the car-itll take about a quar-
ter of an hour-and get some eatable stuff
at the bakery that wont have to be
cooked youre not supposed to leave
the car you know but maybe ill want a
bite myself before we get in and ill not
squeal on you

  as i was hungry to the most absolute
degree  fell for the proposition at once
i hurried up-town bought the eatables
and charged back down to the depot
with a pie under each arm and a can of
beans in my pocket

  but when i turned the corner at the
station and began the final dash tor the
train i saw that the traek was empty

   about a half mile toward billings were
the rear lights of  getting dimmer
every second i was left that was all

  would the clerk weigh up the
mail and sign in for me at billings
and persuade the other clerk to sign
me out and do my work on the re-
turn trip or would i be found out
for having left the car and dfs-
charged from the service and
w ould the penalty
stop even there

  what was the law
in such a case was
it not a criminal of-
fense to go off buying
pies and neglect the
care of uncle sams
mail

  but as usually
happens in such a 
case i was perfectly
calm and resigned my-
self to fate i couldnt
help feeling that pos-
sibly i hadnt fully
realized the serious-
ness of my situation

  meanwhile h o w -
ever i would drop
back up-town and
have a good hot sup-
per and a comfortable
bed for the night at
the railroad hotel i
had gone half a block
when a hopeful idea
struck me the

    	r r

deadwood and edgemont train known
to mail-clerks as the  dead and edge
was on track no  and they always
waited for us before they left town as
they depended upon  for all their pas-
sengers and express as well as all mail
matter

   looked back to the station just in
time to see the truckman fling the last
tie-sack of paper-mail into the compart-
ment-car and the engineer was climbing
into the cab again i made a dash for
the depot retaining the pies and beans
and startled the con in the act of giving
the highball

   did  turn his mail-car  i gasped
anxiously

   not yet he replied   theyre going
to turn her out at the  y 

  how far out is it  asked while
the engineer looked back for his signal
to get out of town

can you catch em ive
got to make it  


the railroad mans magazine

   couple o miles-out by the river

   can you catch em ive got to make
it i told him and quickly explained

   maybe he said simply  get on
anyhow and well try

  id have given that conductor a pass-
port to heaven if id had it ive often
wondered whether he really went ahead
and rode in the cab on my account and
if the suddenness with which that town
vanished behind us was brought about for
my sake or if the fact that the train was
twenty hours late had anything to do
with it but the surest thing about it was
that we flew

  when we whizzed into sight of 
they were throwing the mail-car in on
the  y the tracks had separated some
distance back and were now more than
half a mile apart

  the  dead and edges  air went on
and in about two car lengths we slowed
down so much that when i jumped i only
made three revolutions on the sloping
side of the embankment before i got up
and started to run

  then i did a marathon in twenty-

yard time crashing through the south
dakota corn-stalks like a deer

  meanwhile the engine was running in
on the  y coupling up with the car
by the chain running it back to the stem
of the  y then out onto the main track
and sticking it onto the rear end of the -
train with the good coupler

  i had come nearly half a mile on a
day-empty stomach through a corn-field
and had nearly a quarter left to run

  the engine pulled away from the train
passed the switch backed out onto the
 y  again switched back and was ma-
king the home-stretch to the head of the
train as i reached the right-of-way fence

  i used the last of my strength to climb
into the mail-car door just as a whistling
rush of air and a clank underneath the
car told that the engine had coupled and
the air was connected

  well great jimcracks i didnt ex-
pect to see you again  was the mail-
clerks greeting  but im glad you
came have you got the pies 

  i had they were badly smashed but
welcome enough for all that

 i looked at her often and wished that

  the jerkwater had been a cradle of
industry to matt donnelly he had
started as water-boy on a construction
train and then after he had worked as
wiper hostler fireman-mastered every
branch of the service that leads to en-
gine running and was as good and safe
an engineer as ever pulled a throttle-
he had come down to the main line

  but according to main-line standards
nothing good could come from the jerk-
water he was not given an engine but
put to firing

   its all right said donnelly  ill
get a chance some day to show them that
i can handle an engine as well as the
best of them and theyll give me a run
fast enough he believed this and he
told it to katie mullins and katie be-
lieved it and so they were married

  but donnelly did not go up on the
ladder he was made a fireman when
he came to the road and a fireman he re-
mained five years had passed and
there was a pathetic stoop to katies
shoulders as she bent over the sewing
she took in to make both ends meet in
their growing family

  the lilting irish songs were stilled on
her lips and donnelly had almost given
up hope but to-night when collins was
stricken he thought his chance had come

  he would take the special to the end
of the run and he would be so careful
that the old man sleeping away in his
palatial coach would not feel a single
bump to his precious bones

  he would show them that he could
run an engine as well as any man on the
road even if he did learn the trick on
the hay-burners of the despised jerk-
water

  then he would get his run at last ana
katie-ah katie with her patient wist-
ful face and tender eyes-would be hap-

py again when they were living in the
little cottage they had planned

  thus he had dreamed waiting for
francis-to come back and then his dream
had been shattered tears of anger
welled up in donnellys eyes he had
spoken lightly to francis spoken as
though he did not care but that was the
irish pride in him he did care-he did
care bitter disappointment and black
rage filled his heart

  the waiting-room of the stoutland
station was only a few steps from where
donnelly sat in the cab of the 
brooding over his wrongs a child came
to a window saw the engine and dis-
appeared and in another moment was
at the door dragging a woman by the
hand

   theres a train said the child
 lets go to papa on that train

  the woman hurried to the engine

  where does this train go she
asked lifting a tear-stained face does
it go on the branch 

  it doesnt go anywhere for a while
maam answered -donnelly  the en-
gineer took sick and were waitin for
another

    wanted to go to cowan said the
woman  i missed the train and there
wont be another till to-morrow

   y couldnt ride on this train if it
was goin to cowan said donnelly
 its a superintendents special

   no itd be too tony for the likes
of me replied the woman with a smile
that was more of a ghastly grimace than
anything else as she turned away

  she was a poor bedraggled creature
with all the marks of poverty stamped
on her dress and features there was
something about her wobegone condi-
tion that touched donnelly it was the
mute resignation of the poor-the phil-
osophy that reasons that theirs is a mis-
ery that cannot be cured and must be en-
dured he called her back intending to
give her a word out of the abundance of
his sympathy

   was it very important what ye
wanted to go to cowan for he asked

  she turned on him fiercely

   id give my soul to get there to-
night my husbands there and lies
dyin lies askin for me and i cant go
to him
donnellys hunch



dont tell me your troubles
said the operator

     maybe its not that bad said don-
 nelly kindly

   the woman looked up at him a blaze
 in her eyes

     hes dyin i tell you hes dyin i
 drove him away and now hell die and
 never know ive forgiven him and want-
 ed him back a thousand times

    the poor creature was half crazy with
 her grief

     hes dyin hes dyin she kept re-
 peating the words her wild eyes fastened
 on donnellys face he was the only
 person that had spoken kindly to her that
 day she appealed to him lifting her
 hands pitifully  oh why cant i go to
  him 

   donnellys heart was very soft all
 his own troubles were forgotten in pity
 for the woman but he could not stand
 the terrible look in her face

    he turned his head aside to escape her
 stare he looked out of the cab win-
 dow idly

   and then-donnelly became a true

descendant of kings he gave not a
thought to himself his immolation was
completed it was an irish don quixote
that climbed down from the cab

   you wait here a minute he said to
the woman  then he ran to the rear of
the special coach climbed up on the
platform opened the door carefully and
tiptoed along a narrow aisle to the smo-
king-room where the porter was having an
audible dispute with morpheus

   thats good said donnelly listen-
ing a moment  its a sign the old man
is still snoozin

  he ran back led the woman and child
to the front end of the coach and helped
them up

   go in there he said opening the
door and shoving them in  dont for
the life of ve try to go in the other part
of the car just stay here till i copie for
ye if a porter comes and asks ye what
ye are doin tell him ye are takin a ride
and if he bothers ye tell him matthew
donnellyll knock his head off


the railroad mans magazine

  he was gone before the woman be-
wildered by the turn events had taken
could say a word he ran to the switch
that led to the jerkwater swung the tar-
get around then back to the 

   they can take their dirty job and
keep it he muttered to himself as he
reached for the throttle the engine be-
gan to move it crept along the rails
with care and caution like some great
beast that was escaping from its master
the end of the main-line rails were
reached the ponderous drivers of the 
gripped the lighter steel of the jerk-
water and on they went past the cluster
of houses past the coal-chutes

  then donnelly gave her more steam
and they whipped around the curve and
out of sight

  conductor francis found his couch-
an unused corner of the telegraph table
-an uncomfortable one and he did not
pound his ear more than twenty of the
forty minutes of the wait till he rose

  he addressed a few uncomplimentary
and more or less profane remarks about
the sleeping accommodations of the of-
fice to the operator and getting only un-
intelligible grunts in response went to
the window to see how donnelly and the
 were getting along

  he looked out of the window once
rubbed a clear spot on the glass and
looked again then he ran to the door
and stared up the siding to the north
and down the siding to the south he
called the operator and together they
looked up and down the track and
francis even took a look up in the air
they returned to the office and spent a
few seconds looking solemnly at each
other

  the operator opened his key and for
the first time in the history of railroad-
ing clicked the news that an engine and
a special coach bearing the august per-
son of the division superintendent had
disappeared-had faded from the sight
of man

  of course everybody thought donnelly
was crazy and no one thought of the
jerkwater the despatcher asked a thou-
sand questions most of them unanswer-
able i-ie gave a thousand orders most
of them impossible of execution

  all stations on either side of stout-
land were notified to look out for the

runaways for as every one reasoned
there was no telling what direction a
crazy fireman running amuck with an
engine would take the thing to do was
to keep the track clear and avoid collision
if possible

  the languid operator at stoutland
junction was roused to quick action for
once in his life

  francis put in the time walking up
and down the room wording a letter of
resignation he meant to write when ho
should feel a little calmer

  in the midst of things the operator
at swinton a station fifteen miles south
of stoutland broke in on the wire and
a hundred miles of railroad held its
breath and hung on every dot and dash
of his message

  a farmer had telephoned that there
was a wreck on a piece of the road that
ran through his field

  then consternation took a hand in the
game the despatcher ordered all the
doctors in swinton to go to the wreck
and two italian laborers-one with
bumps on his head and one who had
lost a piece of skin the size of a dime-
were hauled to swinton in automobiles
with ten surgeons attending them

  the wreck was that of a belated
work-train that had run past orders to
meet the special at lomax a blind
siding a few miles out of swinton

  donnelly knew every foot every curve
and low joint on the d and k its one
train a day had long since made its
round trip and he had a clear track he
whizzed the  through the little towns
at a rate of speed hitherto unknown on
the jerkwater and yet he was as care-
ful as if katie and maggie and ma-
laclii the twins and little francis
xavier who was but two months old
had been in the special car behind

  most of the stations on the line were
dark at one place a belated agent
came out on the platform and stood with
bulging eyes at the unusual sight

  cowan the town the woman wanted
to reach was twenty-three miles from
stoutland junction and in exactly
thirty-seven minutes which was not bad
time considering that donnelly had to
do his own firing he slowed up at the
deserted station he stopped the engine
and ran to the coach
donnellys hunch



   here ye are he said opening the
door  heres the end of yer journey
the woman began tugging at the
child that had gone to sleep on the moor
donnelly picked up the youngster and
followed the woman as she climbed down
the steps of the car

   wake somebody up in one of them
houses he told her

  she tried to say something she began
sobbing hysterical thanks but donnelly

  he gave three or four ear-splitting
jlasts of the whistle to announce their
arrival slipped quietly down from the
cab and sought his boarding-house by
the most unfrequented path he knew

  he was glad katie was at the other
end of the road it would delay the tell-
ing of the bad news that he was out of
work for a few hours

  he went to bed with a heavy heart
the first thiifg he did next morning

the porter was having an audiele dispute with morpheus

was in the cab before she had said half
a dozen words

   good-by hcrshouted as the train
moved away

  the rest of tjie run was made in forty-
four minutes and at  the  and
the  magnolia with its calmly sleep-
ing occupants steamed into the jerk-
water yards at jacksonville

  there was a switch connecting the
two roads and donnelly might have de-
livered the special to the st l m and

e	station but that would have entailed
publicity and that was something for
which he was not looking

was to pack his few belongings not
considering his job worth resigning he
went to the office and demanded the
money that was coming to him

   cant do anything for you said
the cashier  got orders to send you over
to the general offices as soon as you
show up here the old man wants to
see youf

  the old man was the last person in
the world that donnelly wanted to see
but there was no way out of it he would
have to go on the carpet before he was
allowed to draw his money in the ele-
vator on his way to the old mans of-


the railroad mans magazine

fice he heard the first news of the wreck
two men were talking

   everybody thought the fireman was
crazy one of them was saying  but
it looks as if there might have been
some sort of method in his madness a
work-train ran past a meeting-point and
then went in the ditch on a spread rail
near swinton if the fireman hadnt ta-
ken the special around on the jerkwater
they would have found the spread rail
or smashed into the work-train

   funny how things will happen
said the other man  enough to make
you believe in fate

  this news took donnellys breath
away he wanted to ask the men more
about it but their floor was reached
before he could collect his scattered wits
he kept turning the words over in his
mind as he went through the anteroom
of the superintendents office the old
man was sitting with his back to the
door he turned as donnelly entered

  well whats your trouble he
snapped

   ye wanted to see me said mat-
thew  my name is donnelly

   so youre the man that took me for

an enforced ride over the jerkwater
eh the old man adjusted the glass-
es to his near-sighted eyes- and leaned
forward to get a better look at him

   yes sir said donnelly because
there was nothing else to be said

  the old man sat and stared at him
then lie took his glasses off and polished
them carefully put them back on his
nose and stared again he had the repu-
tation of being hard and many a man
had quailed under that glare but not
donnelly who was thinking of the
words he had heard in the elevator he
wondered if the old man knew his
next words satisfied him on that point

   well what have you got to say for
yourself what made you do such a
crazy thing  

   ye wouldnt believe me if i told ye
said donnellv  yed think it was fool-
ish

   it was foolish roared the old
man slapping the desk  the biggest
fool thing i ever heard of but what
have you got to say out with it 

   i took ye over the jerkwater to keep
ye out of the wreck if id told ye be-
fore there was goin to be a wreck yed

ye could hardly call it that it was
more like a hunch
donnellys hunch



have laughed at me and- said i was
crazy

  donnelly spoke with assurance he
looked the old man square in the eye
with the perfect candor of a child

   what wreck  cried the old man

   the wreck last night said don-
nelly  the work-train that ran past its
ineeting-point

   wait a minute the old man
grabbed a sheaf of telegrams that lay on
the desk it often happens that a divi-
sion superintendent is almost the last
man to hear of an accident the news be-
ing kept from him till tlie details are
complete

   this tells me he said shaking a
paper at donnelly till it made a crack-
ing noise  that work-train no  ran
by their meeting-point at lomax and
then went in the ditch at a point two
miles north of there donnelly nodded
his head  i take it then resumed
the old man  that if you hadnt ab-
ducted me and gone over the jerkwater
we would have either hit the work-train
or found the spread rail ourselves

   thats it sir said donnelly

  the old man wiped his glasses again
blinking his eyes rapidly as he did so

all the harshness was gone out of his
voice when he spoke again

   do you mean to tell me that you
knew this was going to happen and
that you took me around the jerkwater
to avoid it  

   yes sir said donnelly with be-
coming modesty but gulping a little
over the enormity of his prevarication

  fhe old man turned to his desk for
a few seconds when he turned to don-
nelly again he held out a paper

   take this to effinger it is an order
to give you a regular run as engineer
a man that can take me over forty
miles of the kind of track theyve got on
the jerkwater and never wake me up
and can look far enough in the future
to prevent wrecks is too valuable for
the service to lose

   thank ye sir said donnelly as
he took the paper he started to go
but the old man held up a hand

   i want you to tell me something
about this feeling you had was it a
presentiment a sort of premonition
donnelly looked as wise as an owl

   well no sir he said rubbing the
stubble on his chin  ye could hardly
call it that it was more like a hunch

fighting fires on the pennsy

employees extinguished  conflagrations during  saving the

company thousands of dollars

the annual report of the insurance de-
partment of the pennsylvania railroad
shows that the companys own employees ex-
tinguished  fires during  these
fires occurred  property valued at more
than  yet the loss from them
amounted to only about 

  the report derives added significance from
the fact says the raihvay and engineering
review that during the past year additional
equipment for extinguishing tires has been
placed at available points the roads own
organization for lighting fires has been fur-
ther developed by special training of em-
ployees and additional locomotives in yard
service have been equipped with special ap-
paratus for use in case of fire

  a circular is to be issued by the insurance
department giving the causes of all tiros on
the pennsylvania system east and west of

pittsburgh in  in order that the em-
ployees may realize that their efforts to mini-
mize losses from fire are appreciated and
further that their attention may be called
to the number of fires occurring from pre-
ventable causes

  during the year  there were  fires
on the entire system involving a loss of only
 which was exceedingly small com-
paratively as the value of the property was
more than  forty tires entail-
ing a loss of  started on adjacent
property spontaneous combustion was re-
sponsible for a loss of  from  fires

  two fires resulting from careless handling
of lighted cigars cigarettes and matches
caused a loss of  nine fires were due
to tramps with a loss to the company of

the editor of this magazine lias received scores of communications from
young men in all parts of the country asking how the may become
apprentices in the big railway shops the conditions there the pay and
similar questions we are going to answer them in a series of five articles
which we have selected mr robert h rogers to write for the reason that
mr rogers has the twofold ability of being a railroad mechanic and a writer
this is the first article in the series

    we are publishing them in our popular department  help for men
who help themselves because there is no more appropriate place in the
magazine they will be distinguished as  the rogers group however
and will run consecutively until completed this series is no less valuable
than it is interesting to the young railroad aspirant the beginner in the work-
shop the man who is on his first job firing in fact all men who are looking
to the railroad for their future

what some of the great railway systems are doing to educate young
men to cope with the improvements in
railway construction

ry feature in railroad ser-
vice animate or vice versa
has its development from a
very small beginning a
pile of castings billets and
boiler-plate results present-
ly in a complete locomotive and the awk-
ward boy whom you may notice in any
shop choking his hammer and pounding
his hand oftener than the head of the
chisel may become the head of the mo-
tive-power department

  it is true that a long and rocky road
must be traveled to reach this preferment
but with very few exceptions as an
apprentice is where they all began and
from this humble capacity will continue
to be recruited all the guiding hands and
master minds of the future

  all of them in the old days chipped
refractory castings full of burrs swept
the shop and spent unavailing hours in
the quest of impossible and preposterous
tools it was a hard school a great

series began in the august  railroad mans magazine single copies  cents


the railroad apprentice



many will bear witness to this even if we
have pulled out of the rut but the game
was worth the candle and it may be en-
couraging for every beginner to know that
the big job can behis if he honestly gets
into it and tries

  during one of the recent mechanical
conventions in atlantic city several well-
known motive-power chiefs met for an
informal lunch at the marlborough-blen-
heim after a morning session wherein had
been profoundly and resourcefully dis-
cussed the all-important matters of cut
flanges leaky boiler - tubes high - speed
steel and automatic stokers

  perhaps the close attention necessary
to intelligently follow the learned papers
which had been read resulted in these sub-
jects being tabooed after adjournment in
favor of less exacting topics but as
railroading must be talked by its incum-
bents of whatever grade whether on the
ash-pit at jersey city or in executive
session in the railway exchange it could
not long be evaded in this instance

  the form assumed however was a
genuine treat to the writer who was the
only auditor and no less a rare occasion
because the superintendents of motive-
power became reminiscent concerning
their individual advent into the business
in which now in their line they stand at
the head

  they are taciturn too these high offi-
cials they possess to a transcendent de-
gree this peculiar attribute of veteran
engineers and it is pretty hard to get
them to comment on their early days

  big men who began low down

  it transpired that e t white head
of the eastern district of the baltimore
and ohio had been an apprentice and a
wiper in the historic old piedmont shops
when sam houston held forth in that
quarter as master mechanic and to whom
with andrew j cromwell the b and o
is indebted for the advanced mechanical
ideas which in the time of these men
placed it ahead of its contemporaries

  mr white had good schooling in the
railroad game but he was a good pupil
too through ability only and without a
single push behind him he passed through
all the grades leading to his present posi-
tion and the end is not vet

  frgnk t hyndman of the new york
new haven and hartford railroad was
running an engine on the old pittsburgh
and western between that tokvn and
chicago junction within the ken of the
writer who was roundhouse foreman at
the glenwood terminal where mr hynd-
mans engine put up

  a	stewart of the southern railway
swung a hammer for many years in tlie
u p shops before he saw his way to the
top

all were poor boys

  many of the older employees of the
erie railroad recall when t rumney
now general mechanical superintendent
had charge of the rod-gang in the sus-
quehanna shops of that road and it hasnt
been so long ago either

  he rose from machinist  matter
through what changes of management the
road passed in the meantime when a
better job opened up in his particular
field he was always the logical candidate
for consideration and always approved
by his superiors whoever they might be

  these men were poor boys-plain
every-day apprentices at the start they
had to work for a living and they chose
railroading with possibly a single ex-
ception they did not have the benefit of
college training or even theoretical
groundwork in their future duties but
what they have since acquired in that di-
rection is astounding

  the effort on their part which result-
ed in literally  picking up  advanced
knowledge in the face of the terrific pace
set by their daily work must have been
tremendous yet they succeeded and are
to-day among the top-notch motive-power
men of the country

  whether based on fact or not it has
often been remarked that the brightest
minds in railroading are to be found in
the motive-power ranks and it need not
be wondered at because interest naturally
centers in the spectacular mammoth
engines a giddy race with time shops
replete with wonder-working machinery
terminal roundhouses with all their pic-
turesque detail of personnel and environ-
ment-these attract a young man

the locomotives suggest their crews
and all the stirring stories which have


the railroad mans magazine

been written about them and which will
continue to be written until the end of
time

the trades taught

  the shops appeal to the ingenuity and
the mechanical instinct maybe dormant
but nevertheless inherent in us all and the
smoky roundhouse interests through the
concentration of energy and human re-
sourcefulness which the veriest tyro can-
not but admit must be housed within its
battered and windowless walls

  that the ambitious young man of to-
day finds all this just as appealing is
shown by the fact that the erie railroad
has on file some two thousand applications
from young men who wish to enter as
apprentices

  the baltimore and ohio can pro-
duce as many more and the pennsylvania
double the number of either these are
applications for machinist air-brake in-
spector which is now taught as a separate
trade blacksmith boiler - maker tin-
smith pipe-fitter electrician car-builder
cabinet-maker carpenter pattern-maker
and rnolder all of which are necessary in
modern car and locomotive building and
maintenance	v

  the majority of these applications are
for machinist apprentice in the propor-
tion of at least four to one this is un-
doubtedly the most comprehensive of all
trades from its ranks are recruited a
larger number for supervising and official
positions than any other

  it is of course impossible to provide
for all of these applicants but on the
larger roads at least about five hundred
boys take up the work annually and of
this number seventy-five per cent finish
out their allotted time of three or four
years dependent on the requirements of
the trade which they are to learn

future of  youngsters

  what of the possibly twenty thousand
young men who every year are given the
chance to learn a trade the carefully
compiled statistics of the writer extend-
ing over many years indicate that one
thousand will become sub-foremen or in
other words gang-bosses two hundred
and fifty will be foremen and seventy-five
general foremen

  fifty of these general foremen will
become master mechanics and five of the
latter will be heads of that department
mechanical superintendents or superin-
tendents of motive-power call it what you
will

  this may seem a bit discouraging to
the aspirant for honors in this attractive
field but remember always that deadwood
is inimical to and inseparable from all
callings there is naturally a weeding-
out process in the evolution of a future
superintendent of a department so vital
and those who fall by the wayside can
generally and without a strained retro-
spect unearth the true cause of their un-
doing

  without a reference to the pluck of
those who years ago learned the business
it would be unfair to comment on the
tremendous advantages possessed by an
apprentice of these days

  no more striking contrast could possi-
bly be imagined than between these fa-
vored individuals and those who served
their time in the so-called  good old
days when these two contrasts are laid
side by side it seems really astonishing
that every beginner of the nineteenth
century is not head of his chosen profes-
sion at first hand

	he  good old days

  to learn the machinists trade twenty
or twenty-five years ago meant a degree
of hardship inconceivable almost in this
age of progress the general plan of
training say up to  was to start the
apprenticesin the roundhouse for a year
and to regard them merely as extra
pairs of arms and legs to do the bidding
of anybody connected with the  knock-
about  gang

  this gang composed of a boss two
machinists two helpers and one or two
of the green boys contended with all the
hard work of removing and applying
driving-wheel tires dropping wheels in
the pit for new boxes and changing
springs all of which with the crude ap-
pliances then in use were very laborious
operations

  it should be added that a roundhouse
in which this work is done is rather a dis-
enchanting proposition to a novice at all
times and on all occasions in summer
the railroad apprentice



the thermometer frequently climbs around
 degrees and the boss would gener-
ally find a place to put the new boy where
he- would have no difficulty in appre-
ciating the temperature

  he would no doubt think of happy
school-days and the cool quiet of his
country home while lying over the high
boiler of a  hog with all the lagging
burned from under the jacket and lag-
ging in those days was simply boards
he would be trying to pack one of those
tlirottle-valves arranged on top the skin
peeling off his fingers from contact with
the network of red-hot pipe and half
strangled by the smoke from his open
kerosene torch

some  fancy  jobs

  there were other jobs too which even
the writer cannot recall without a tremor
manywho read this have not forgotten
the problem of the disconnected throttle
wjiich rigging always came apart at a
point under the shell of the boiler about
six feet in the rear of the dome

  there were a good many things in those
boilers-stays crown-bars and what not
and after the dome-cover was off and the
throttle-box removed it became the time-
honored job of the thinnest and smallest
apprentice to be lowered by his feet head
first down the dome and make his way
over the crown bars to the seat of the
trouble

  it was no trouble to replace the pin
the loss of which meant the disconnected
throttle but it was an awful job to worm
ones way back again to where welcome
hands would seize his feet and haul him
out

  it is remembered in this connection that
joe brady once an apprentice with the
writer but now probably general foreman
of the b and o at the riverside round-
house in baltimore became stuck in tlie
boiler of the  on his return trip fol-
lowing this feat

  they claim that if a man loses his nerve
he swells when in such environment but
it is nevertheless a fact that they thought
the boiler would have to be cut apart
before joe was finally released

  winter in these old roundhouses was
not much of an improvement they were
ramshackle affairs at the best all of them

the doors didnt fit there was always
a gap under them of from one-half to
three inches and it required all the waste
bagging which we could beg or steal from
the oil-house to stop the crevices

  there wasnt a whole pane of glass
anywhere how the wind did whoop it
up when the wind was blowing right
then the boys would put in many hours in
the cold and damp pits under the engines
chipping away the ice so that the bolts
could be uncovered to loosen the nuts

  the drop-pits on which this work was
done were not tlie quick-action affairs of
the present operated by an hydraulic or
air jack with a minimum of labor but
on the contrary they were extremely
primitive

  the entire machinery for lowering the
table on which the pair of driving-wheels
rested while being dropped consisted of
a jack-screw in each corner turned by a
wheel taken from the brake-staff of a

  of course every new apprentice was
assigned to the unenviable job of oper-
ating one of these wheels unenviable is
without reservation because there are
tricks in all trades the older hands on
the other three wheels had the art of run-
ning their own down in unison finely de-
veloped leaving the apprentice to lower
practically all of the weight to the ac-
companiment of blistered hands and a
lame back

hunting  john murphy

  there was another feature too hat
was  raw and so  raw  that its n ji-
ory lingers through all of these many
years

  that was the innocent but none the
less disheartening  kidding  to which
every new boy became the logical victim

  he was sent off in a hurry and always
on a long journey for some impossible
tool for instance a machinist in the
 knockabout  gang would opportunely
discover that the progress of the work
at hand must be hed up until he could
secure the loan of a  half-round square
this impossible tool being the property of
a certain  john murphy

  john murphy was always farthest
from the gang which the limits of the
shop would permit if indeed he were


the railroad mans magazine

not equally as mythical as the tool itself
the apprentice would be instructed to
borrow this appliance from mr murphy
and not return without it

  fertility of invention worthy of a bet-
ter cause was displayed by the mechanics
of those days in creating these errands
the boys were hustled after  straight
hooks  left-hand monkey-wrenches
 whistle-tuners and  smooth files

  they carried bogus orders to the store-
keeper for  white lamp-black and to
the blacksmith to temper a  lead-center
punch carefully filed into a semblance
of the steel article

sent for  blast

  there is indeed an instance on record
where an apprentice spent his entire din-
ner-hour in begging the foreman of the
iron-foundry for-a bucket of  blast he
was anxious to please the machinist for
whom he was working and that worthy
had informed him that a great favor
would be conferred if he could possibly
beg or borrow a bucket of  blast

  this is a part of what happened to the
big boys who went to learn a trade in
those  good old days because there was
an infallible precedent to sort the new-
comers in two classes big and little

  the big ones had their initiation in the
roundhouse while their smaller brothers
were assigned to the machine-shop until
they grew up strong enough to stand the
roundhouse and its vicissitudes

  it cannot be said that they fared any
b er either the machine-shops of those
days wouldnt bear much comparison with
what you may now see at reading or
hornell there were no gear-tables on
the lathes and if you wanted to chase
an eight or a twelve thread you had to
cover the whole machine-shop floor with
figures and many of these figures had as
little bearing on the matter at hand as the
 whistle-tuner  on the device to which
it refers

  this first year of apprenticeship was
the real test of a boys staying qualities
if he survived it there was good stuff in
him the remaining three years didnt go
so hard he received his reward in the
shape of a  bounty now a thing of the
past and a clearance into the full-fledged
machinists ranks

  the  bounty  was a great institution
and it is a pity that it has passed away
it meant that from each and-every days
pay eight cents would be deducted by the
company to be paid in a lump at the
expiration of the apprenticeship

  this amount usually  was a pretty
good stake for a boy getting  free of
course there were certain tithes on this
amount but enough remained to buy a
good kit of machinists tools and more
cash at one time besides than the boy ever
saw

  after they were  out of their time
and received their  bounty they gener-
ally drifted away from the home fold to
secure experience boys who started as
apprentices long ago gave value received
for the trade they learned it was simply
a case of the survival of the fittest straight
through and represents the school in
which those whose names are mentioned
at the beginning of this article acquired
their knowledge

  the trade had to be picked up largely
from the mechanics in the shop where the
boy worked and the result was almost
entirely dependent on the desire of these
mechanics to impart information there
was little disposition on the part of the
shop supervisors to teach any apprentice
the foreman thought his duty done when
he placed the boy as helper with a good
mechanic or in a position where he might
pick up what was to be learned

seeking information

  the old apprenticeship system was
wofully weak in this particular feature
because it lacked the spirit of cooperation
before the advent of the shop instructor
-who is now paid to instil the ideas and
best procedure in the mind of the appren-
tice through practical demonstration-
the apprentice when placed on a machine
asked a mechanic how to do a certain job

  he had to ask him as there was no
other way the mechanic would say
 you will have to learn that the same
way that  did if the boy went to the
foreman for information he would usual-
ly find him so loaded with other duties
that he would not have any time to devote
to apprentice education

  the result was that the machine did
not turn out the work and unless the ap-
the railroad apprentice



prentice proved to be an unusually good
 sticker  lie became disgusted with his
trade

  so much for what used to be  but what
a revelation for some of those old foremen
if they could walk through one of the
perfectly appointed apprentice schools of
the present day	

the difference to-day

  they would see classes presided over
by competent and well-paid instructors
drawing-rooms with all implements fur-
nished free of cost to the apprentices in
the shops it would be noted that the boys
work on a defined schedule  that they are
changed from machine to machine or
from operation to operation at stated
times and not allowed to remain two years
on a bolt lathe

  the slow boy is shifted in the regular
routine so that the quicker boy who is to
follow him may have the full time al-
lowed upon the machine a slow boy
who does not show decided improvement
after three or six days of instruction is
taken off the machine and put on special
work for which he is better suited

  he is told that the company cannot
afford to reduce the output of that ma-
chine

  some boys learn quickly and others
slowly the quick boy often makes mis-
takes while the slow ones when the idea
is grasped seldom forget it for this
reason every effort is made to study the
dull boy and bring him up to the standard
before removing him from a machine

improving the shops

  in order to meet the demands made on
their shops many railroad companies
within the past four or five years have
practically renewed all shop machinery
additions to shops power-houses round-
houses and roundhouse machine - shops
have been built to keep in good condition
the motive power and car equipment to
derive the greatest possible benefit from
this investment it is certain that the com-
panies must have trained skilled and
careful workmen

  in keeping with this advanced move-
ment the erie railroad has created an
organization for the purpose of giving

technical and practical instruction to
young men who enter its service as ap-
prentices it has established apprentice
schools at meadville pennsylvania hor-
nell new york susquehanna pennsyl-
vania and dunmore pennsylvania

  these schools are free to apprentices in
all departments and attendance is com-
pulsory instruction in the classes covers
the fundamental rules of arithmetic com-
mon and decimal fractions proportion
simple problems in interest tables and
weights the elementary principles of
plane and solid geometry mechanical
drawing practical and theoretical me-
chanics and instructions pertaining to
the construction of cars and locomotives
as well as lessons in their successful and
economical operation

  apprentices seeking employment in the
shops of the erie and the same require-
ments apply practically to the other roads
maintaining these schools must not be
less than sixteen nor more than twenty-
one years old and have good general
health

making application

  preference is always given to the sons
of employees all applications for ap-
prenticeship are made to the master me-
chanic or officer in charge of the shop
and the applicants are sent directly to the
instructor of apprentices who examines
them as to their general education

  if he finds that they are qualified for
the position sought he so certifies to the
proper officer and the applicant enters
the service

  the rules and regulations of this and
other companies are based on a specified
course of four years as the maximum time
to be served time lost by apprentices is
not allowed but each apprentice must put
in three hundred days or the number of
hours a day which the shop works before
he is entitled to advancement to another
year

  those who complete the course as in-
dicated by the award of a certificate of
apprenticeship are given machinists rates
in the shop in which they are employed
the rate being based upon ability and
merit

  apprentices in this department are
given a general knowledge of the differ-

 and under the instruction of the man in
 charge of the laying-out table

 the term of service in this work will
 be at least six months at the end of

able to take a third and so on

  the erie railroad company announces
in connection with its apprentice schools
that the movement has for its primary
object not the making of mechanical en-
gineers out of shop workmen but the
making of first-class skilled mechanics so
that the shop forces may be sure of men
trained and educated iii erie standards
and erie methods

  those who prophesied a few years ago
that the new apprentice system which was
being established on the new york cen-
tral lines would deteriorate and die a
natural death as soon as the first excite-
ment passed off must be glad to learn
that they were badly mistaken

  after three years those who have fol-
lowed its progress closely are convinced
of the principles on which it is estab-
lished

  the new york central has now ten
schools in connection with its shops-at
beech grove indiana  collinwood ohio 
depew new york east buffalo new
york elkhart indiana jackson michi-
gan mckees rocks pennsylvania
oswego new york st thomas onta-
rio and west albany new york the
last report indicates a total of  ap-
prentices enrolled the union pacific
and the santa fe have also fallen in line
and are organizing apprentice instruction
schools in their various shops

what apprentices have done

  the wonderful susceptibility to me-
chanical development induced by this
systematic course of training is well illus-
trated by the following instances taken
at random from some of the shops of the
new york central lines

  in the west albany shops a first-year
apprentice with only two-weeks experi-
ence bored twelve eccentrics in thirteen
hours and five eccentric straps in seven
and one-half hours

  a second-year apprentice with helper
set the valves on an engine in seven hours
he also set valves on two other engines in
good time a second-year apprentice
with helper lined up two sets of guides
and coupled pistons all in six hours

this boy had only three months experi-

   	r r

ence in this work a third-year appren-
tice in charge of the rod job repaired
thirty-two main rods ten pairs of front-
end brasses and eighteen pairs of back-
end brasses he also made two sets of
front-end brasses all of this work was
done in three weeks

  at the oswego shops an apprentice
with but three-months experience with
a helper ran the link job successfully
during the temporary absence of the regu-
lar foreman at the elkhart shops a
third-year apprentice laid out a new drop-
pit jack for the roundhouse from a blue-
print

in the drafting-room

  at the mckees rocks shops two fourth-
year apprentices had full charge of a pit
with an engine for general repairs the
boys ordered all parts made sketches for
new bolts lined up the guides laid off the
shoes and wedges wheeled and trammed
the engine and set the valves

  a fourth-year apprentice took complete
charge of erecting a new engine includ-
ing the following jobs leveling and
squaring the frames scribing and chip-
ping the saddle laying off the shoes and
wedges and wheeling and tramming the
engine

  in connection with this mechanical
training bos are used in the drafting-
room both before and after graduation
before graduation those best fitted for the
work spend three months making blue-
prints drawings and tracings after
graduation those specially adapted may
be used as regular draftsmen

  when rushed the head draftsman often
takes drawings to the apprentice class-
room to be worked up or traced ap-
prentices assist the drafting-room in ma-
king numerous tests such as indicating
engines dynamometer car testsj coal tests
etc

  debating clubs give the boys an oppor-
tunity to write and talk on mechanical
subjects speaking in public makes and
develops initiative and the ability to do
this is due to classroom instruction club
socials and picnics bind the boys to their
fellow workmen and build up valuable
friendships the boys learn to under-
stand and respect their superiors but not
to fear them


the railroad mans magazine

    the cause of this striking movement in
 the interests of advanced education brief-
 ly summarized is due to the tremendous
 strides in the development of the locomo-
 tive in the last twenty-five years and to
 little else

a perplexing problem

   in  the standard passenger-engine
 in use throughout the country had cylin-

-	ders sixteen inches in diameter and twen-
 ty-four inches stroke of piston a toy com-
 pared with the present passenger-engine
 of the atchison topeka and santa fe-
 the -which would pull ten such
 engines as those of the centennial year
 and their trains also

    the early locomotive builders had this
 advantage the established gage of track
 - feet si inches-was larger than
 their ideas while their ideas progressed
 slowly the extension of railroads pro-
 ceeded tremendously until  miles
 of track was laid in this country-and all
 at that gage of  feet j inches not
 until this mileage was down did the fact
 dawn that the locomotive was outgrowing
 a gage now too late to change

    it is certain that this will remain the
 standard width of track for all time to
 come as it is certain that no more than
 fifteen feet will remain the limit of over-
 head clearance

    during the past thirty years the weight
 of the locomotive has increased on this
 -feet---incli gage from less than 
 tons to upward of  tons engines
 have become higher and wider until the

limit has been reached in both directions
and the only thing which can be done
now is to improve the efficiency of the
machine within the present limitations

  to cope with these requirements per-
plexing problems are presented and be-
fore they can be successfully combated
each and every man in the mechanical
department must be specially trained to
an appreciation of the difficulties

  this explains largely why we have ap-
prentice schools they were not needed
in the old days because the track was
bigger than the engine but now the loco-
motive dwarfs the track and all that can
be done is to enhance its power within
itself

thinkers are wanted

  this is why the railroads want their
boys to think and they are willing to
spend any amount of money to encourage
them because the greenest among them
all may stumble on something which
might mean a revolution

  they pay their apprentices well too
when compared to the old das the
writer put in his apprenticeship at sev-
enty cents a day for the first year with
ten cents a day added for each succeeding
year

  it is not unusual for to receive now
eighty cents the first year  the second
 the third and  the last year

  this may be an unwritten chapter in
railroading but it is true in illustrating
the effort which all roads are making to
develop men

    in the next article in this series which will appear in our may issue mr rogers will
describe the occupation of a railroad machinist
the greater love

by benjamin rush thornbury

          sam selkirk proves that the victory
          of love is as great as that of war

he gaunt frame building that
had served as division head-
quarters at centerpoint for
the past quarter of a century
trembled and creaked in the
grasp of the blizzard every-
body down in the yard who could leave
his work had been driven to the shelter
of roundhouse and train-slied by the fury
of its blinding gusts

  even the snorting little switch-engine
that had just finished making up an extra

crawled under the leeward side of the  	 o  

coal-chutes to keep itself warm the running over the old mans special to

sure to find some reason for running that
varnished wagon of his out on the line
to play shuttle-cock with the schedule
its a bad night to keep things moving
lie was addressing no one in particu-
lar but the superintendent wheeled
around from his desk-in the corner and
faced him

   speaking of the old man he said
 did you notice that drunken bum that
just went out

   no he snapped  ive been too busy
keeping half a dozen hog-trains from

big ten-wheeler that had backed down
and coupled onto the long line of empties
was panting a protest at being dragged
out on such a night its breath freezing
upon its black sides as it fell

  a shaft of light shot across the yard
as an upper door opened and closed
and the form of a man came out upon
the landing and staggered down the
creaking steps that flanked that side of
the gaunt building

  it moved slowly across the half dozen
tracks and disappeared through the open
door of a box car that stood in the out-
going train

  a lamp waved a signal from the ca-
boose and was answered by two short
blasts from the engine-and with a clank-
ing of draw-bars that sounded sharp
above the storm the extra pulled slowly
down the yard

   it never snows but theres a blizzard
out here grumbled the night despatcher
bending over the train-sheet at the long
instrument table in the center of the room
 and that applies to something more than
the weather chart too just let us get
a heavy run of stock and tlie old mans

notice anything whats- he got to do
with the old man

   nothing now but there was a time
about ten years ago when the old man
was a strong factor in his life the
superintendent hitched his chair over to
the table and cocked up his heels

   just a moment ill get this extra
out of town and then eat my lunch while
you talk interrupted the other

   it isnt a long story began the su-
perintendent as he lighted a cigar and
carefully studied the burning end  that
drunken bum is sam selkirk at one time
the smoothest operator on the m i and
n copper-plate copy and all that and
his morse came so clean that even fatty
dalton out at elba would not break him
and thats saying a lot for fatty was the
worst ham on the division

  that was before the consolidation and
just after they brought mr goodell down
here from the soo to be general man-
ager the road never saw such times
as that before nor since for he was the-
best all-around operating manager they
ever had

   well sam blowed into the general




the railroad mans magazine

offices one clay they were located at
kensington then and hit -the old man
for a job i guess no one ever knew
where he came from as that was before
the days of the petligree system and a
man got a job for what he could do and
not what he had done

   beyond the fact that he could pound
brass the old man never asked any
questions i was a clerk in the office at
the time and i remember the expression
on the old mans face when sam sat
down to that key he did love a -com-
petent man  matter what branch of
the service he happened to be in

   you can bet there wasnt any bulled
messages in that office after that and
things went on as smooth as the road-bed
for about six months until one day joe
kelsoe came in on no  and an-
nounced that he needed a despatcher and
needed him bad

   you never knew joe did you well
he was the littlest man with the biggest
heart you will find anywhere and when
it came to getting trains over this hun-
dred and forty-four miles of steel and
cotton-wood his peer wasnt born he
went down east when the road was gob-
bled up but he was train-master here in
centerpoint at that time

   the old man knew by the way joe
cut his eyes around at selkirk when he
made the announcement that he might
as well look out for a new operator for
what joe went after he usually got and
so the next day sam was ordered to re-
port here for second trick work that
was the beginning of sams troubles

  the superintendent paused to relight
his cigar while the night despatcher
marked up an os on no  on the
train-sheet and said  gn  to the oper-
ator

   of course there was a girl in the
case continued his chief  and the girl
in sams case was jim okeefes daugh-
ter jim was road-master the old man
having brought him and the chief des-
patcher down with him from the soo
we had no superintendent here in those
days that work being divided between
the chief despatcher and the train-master

   the chief was a good man all right
or the old man wouldnt have had him
and we all thought he was straight as
a die but a lot of straight trees have

crooked roots you know and they never
showed in his make-up until sam raked
off some of the dirt by taking up with
fanny okeefe

   somehow fanny never told sam
that she and the chief had been thick up
north from that moment the chief be-
 gan throwing it into sam and never let
up until he finally got his scalp

    things went on that way until sam
and fanny concluded to tie up she
was buying her wedding things and sam
went around with the glad hand out to
everybody the boys used to say that
even his  ok  sounded like a  god
bless you and many a lonesome lad up on
the west got an hour off when sam knew
he ought to have been doing his work

    he paid no attention to the malice
of the chief and took a good deal off
him for the sake of peace he always did
his work and everybody liked him from
the old man down

   about that time the transcontinent-
al bought up the line and there was a
general shake-up all around the gen-
eral offices at kensington were abolished
and the road made a part of the st
toe branch of the continental they
wanted the old man to go down there
as general superintendent but he was
too good a man to sub to any of those
wall street importations and as good as
told them so besides he was tired of
the game anyway so he resigned and
moved over into illinois and went into
the real estate business

    i never did know just how it hap-
pened for i was in st joe at the time
having been moved down there along
with the other office fixtures but it seems
that the chief had some kind of a pull
with the powers-that-be that we didnt
know anything about and the first thing
i knew he was carded up as superintend-
ent of the division

    just one week from that day sam was
 fired for cause of course it was plain
 to everybody that the cause was under the
 new superintendents hat but you dont
 need a gatling gun to kill a mosquito
 and sam wasnt much more than that in
 the transcontinental eye

   he came down in a day or two to
get his time and i never saw such a
change in a fellow i started to open the
subject of his trouble but lie shut up like
the greater love



 a clam didnt have a word to say against
 anybody only that he guessed he would
 go out west and grow up with the
 country

   that was the last i saw of him until
he drifted in here to-night on- this bliz-
zard and i never learned the whole story
until the chief was raised from superin-
tendent to general manager of western
lines and  came up here to take his
place

  our general manager exploded
the night despatcher

   our general manager pursued the
superintendent  it seems that what-
ever the charge was he queered sam with
the girl as well as the company and in
six months married her himself and i
guess it was that more than the loss of
his job that put sam all to the bad and
he must have gone to the bottom for i
didnt know him to-night until he told
me who he was

   he wanted me to place him but i
couldnt do anything for him for the
old man had seen to it that he is on
the black book of every general manager
in the country and it would have been
worth as much as my head i have a
wife and two little ones that must come
first	

   i offered to stake him though but
he straightened up in a semblance of that
old imperious way of his and said he
wasnt looking for charity he wanted a
job i told him then that the old man
was coming through to-night and that if
he would wait i would see if something
couldnt be done in the matter he turned
on his heel and went out i never saw
murder in a mans eye but-

   ds ds ds-br

   the night despatcher opened the key
to answer the call and the superintendent
went quietly back to his desk in the cor-
ner he wasabout to ask how the spe-
cial was coming on when he heard a
sharp exclamation behind him and
turned to see the night despatcher stand-
ing rigid in front of his key  his face was
as white as chalk

   great scott man ive put second 
head-on into that special 

  what do you mean gasped the
superintendent springing to his side
 speak man for heavens sake say
something 

   the night despatcher had fallen limp

in his chair and the haggard face he
raised to his chief was like death he
pointed silently to the open order-book

    i got that train of empties over to
the junction for them and then gave them
that meeting-point with second   they
left there ten minutes ago and bradford
just said  had run his signal board and
had gone over the hill tils light was
out

  he was speaking calmly now but his
slow deliberate sentences came with a
metallic ring

    that means he continued  that in
about twenty minutes from now that train
load of hogs will be going down deanley
hill at a forty-mile clip and about five
minutes later she will land on that spe-
cial and-

   and no night man at deanley 
the superintendent groaned

    yes affirmed the other  price goes
home after no  passes and the
old mans wife and daughter with him
too whats that  he leaned toward
the sounder which was clicking rapidly

  what is it asked the superin-
tendent

  wait  the word cracked like a
pistol - shot then he began translating
slowly

    dont worry up there ds im not the
operator here but i got that report br
just sent and have put a glim  the
bulls-eye itll stop the one that gets here
first and-

   the circuit went wide open and did not
close again leaving the two staring at
each other in helpless amazement

    sounds like a message from heaven
said the night despatcher in a whisper

   extra east pulled up at deanley tank
and the fireman crawled over the ice-
covered tender to let down the spout a
brakeman jumped down from the caboose
steps pulled his cap over his ears and
started toward the engine

turning when he saw a tattered shoe pro-
truding from the door of a box car

   here this aint no pullman lim-
ited clear out o here   he called rough-
ly and giving the foot a jerk the form
of a man struck the frozen ground and
lay in a heap the brakeman swung to
the steps of the passing caboose and the
tail-lights glimmered around the curve

  the man rose to his feet and steadied
himself with an effort then staggered
across the snow-covered platform to the
door of the station it swung open against
his weight and he fell prone across the
floor of the little waiting-room a ruddy
glow from the smoldering fire came
through the open door of the stove aid
petted the white upturned face with little
caressing touches of color

  for half an hour he lay thus with no
sign of life save the quick rise and fall
of the stiffened coat at his chest when on
the other side of the lattice partition
an instrument began pounding rapidly

  the man stirred uneasily and raised
himself upon his elbow his eyes fixed
in a glassy stare he was listening in-
tently suddenly he struggled to his feet
and stood with fists tightly clenched his
face was the face of a demon

   at last he sobbed  at last hang

fatal courtesy

a guileless rustic wishing to be em-
ployed on a railway emerged from the
examination-room and informed his father
he had failed because he was color-blind

but you cant have said his father
youre no more color-blind than i am

   i know that feyther he replied  but
its all through bein polite

  what do you mean explain yourself
 well feyther  went into a room and a
chap held something up for me to look at
this is green isnt it ses he come
now youre positive its green  quite plead-
ing like and though i could see plain
enough that it wor red i couldnt find it in
my heart to tell him so so i agreed with
him and they bundled me out no more
perliteness for me it dont pay -pear-
sons clondon iveckly

him hang him and hell die like
the dog that he is if she was only there

too-she-she oh my fanny

  a mighty passion shook him then slow-
ly as the light breaking through a storm-
cloud his features relaxed and the fire
illumined a transformed face

 like a madman he flung himself
against the frail door and burst into the
office tearing open cupboard and locker
he at last found the lantern and hugged
it to him with a little inarticulate cry
in another instant he was at the stove
again wrenching off the globe as he ran

  insensible to the pain he grasped a
blazing coal and held it to the wick it
flickered and went out he flung it back
and picked another and was successful

 he replaced the globe with shaking
hands and darted outside to the plat-
form where he hooked the lantern to the
signal-board stumbling he groped his
way back to the office and sank f into the
chair at the instrument-table

  outside above the howl of the increas-
ing storm a locomotive uttered a single
shriek which was echoed by another far
up the track and a moment later the
two panting engines came to a shuddering
stop with their frosty noses almost touch-
ing a glimmer of ruby light fell softly
upon them from the swinging lantern

   inside they found the corpse of a man
his stark fingers clutching the key of a
telegraph instrument

just a habit

a number of railway men were once
discussing the question of accidents
 the roads in scotland said one official
 used to have a bad name indeed in re-
spect to accidents no one thought of em-
barking on a railway journey unless he had
provided himself with an accident policy

   the famous dr norman macleod was
once about to set off on a long journey
through the scotch country just as the
train was pulling out the clergymans serv-
ant put his head through the window and
asked

     hac ye taen an insurance ticket sir
    i have replied the doctor

    then continued the servant  write
yeer name on it and gie to me they hae
an awfu habit of robbin the corpses on this

letters of an old railroad
man and his son

by herman da costa

no -the scheme of a real winner

breezy secured a job as office-boy and although he incurred die
everlasting enmity of the c c he learned something
new about railroading

had been a fruit-train and id told them
to hold it for regular movement the next
day

  connelly went up in the air about it
it seems that they had intended this train
to be delivered in new york the follow-
ing morning and were going to put on
extra engines and give it tlie right of way
in order to get a big piece of traffic from
the south

  when t f came out of course he
had to be told what had happened then
the general traffic manager came in and
he had to be told and then as if to add
insult to injury the third vice-president
strolled in and the whole blame thing was
gone over again

  you have been telling me a lot dad
about how t f can cuss i know all
right now if there wasnt a cuss word
that he didnt know it was because hed
neyer heard it i expected every minute
that id lose my head i would have too
if it hadnt been for the s g and q
offering to let us use their engine to haul
it through  and by some good luck we
happened to have a pilot down there who
took the engine over the road

  that was mistake no  about two
days after  was fixing up a lot of passes
and in going out to lunch left two books
which had been countersigned by con-
nelly lying on my desk when i came

-jim to the old man

           ear dad  of late ive been
             having a pretty hard time
             of it at the office i was
             pretty well discouraged
             the reason i got discour-
             aged was on account of a
             little trouble i had with t f

  martin t fs secretary had been
homesick right along and ive done all
of martins work of course mr con-
nelly did some of it too but when the
fruit season opened connelly had his
hands full attending to his own work so
that i had to do all of the work by my-
self

  one day a rush wire came in asking
what should be done with a train of
peaches that was to be delivered us from
tlie s g and q at fredericksburg that
afternoon

  id been watching the fruit movements
for some time and as that was a part of
martins work and connelly and t f
were very busy i wired our people to re-
ice the cars at fredericksburg and hold
them for regular movement the next day

  late that afternoon t f was out talk-
ing with connelly and i heard connelly
teil him that there had been no fruit-
train that day after t f left  went
over to connelly and told him that there


the railroad mans magazine

hack they had gone i didnt think any-
thing of it until live oclock when i
couldnt find them any more and then i
told connelly about it

   coming so soon after the other trouble
it made things look pretty badly the
worst of it was that we hadnt taken a
record of the book numbers and so
couldnt tell which books were missing in
order to take them up when presented

eel a letter the next day by connelly
in which the general superintendent
through his c c politely and gently in-
formed us that we were drunk

   then for a couple ofdays little things
happened they just seemed to flow
along as if they had determined to flood
me under i got so that i was afraid to
shake hands with anybody for fear they
would drop dead

i felt as if everybody had it in for me
just because j happened to run into a lit-
tle streak of bad luck for one day and
somehow when i get in that shape im
not worth my bread and butter so far as
work is concerned

there are lots of people in this world
who get down in the mouth one minute
and up in the clouds the next but you
know im not ojie of that class still
when things begin coming at all like the
way they did recently i just cant help
feeling blue

 have often thought it really doesnt
amount to anything for in
two weeks time i would
forget all about it and perk
right up again but i get in
the dumps once in a while
and when i do i stick

  im not going to make
you blue however ill get
over it i guess in time

   martin is still sick and
im still with the railroad
nothing much on hand now

a lot of

ordering

though times
seems

vv-rrr

breezy heard some one enter-the office

he passed it up however although be
was supposed to report it to t f

  the next day i made a mistake of
twelve hours in reporting that  the fast
freight had run late on a trip and it
wasnt until after a hot letter had been
written to the general superintendent
about it that we found out it was a mis-
take

   of course it was too late to stop it
and  had the pleasure of being hand-

theyre
new cars and
look hard nobody
particularly worried

  cant yoh get mother to
take her picture and send
it to me get yours taken
with her so i can put it up

-	on the mantel in my room
give miss pesnelle my love
and ask mother to write soon affec-
tionately	jim

the old man to jim

  dear jim before you start reading
this letter pick a nice easy chair with a
good light over your shoulder

you said in your last letter that you
got discouraged with your work i want
letters of an old railroad man and his son 

to tell you about a young friend of mine
who used to work in the superintendents
office on the new york division twenty
years ago the boys called him breezy
he was too he was as breezy a sight
as ever blew down the pike

  one day the superintendent was sitting
in the inner office when he felt somebody
was standing before him and looked up
it was a boy about nineteen with hair
like red ink and a face full of freckles

   what is it  asked the superintend-
ent

   how are you   asked the boy in a
kindly voice holding out his hand

  the superintendent shook it

   i came after a job explained the
boy confidentially

   what job -

   office-boy

  after talking to the bov a while the
superintendent called in his chief clerk
swidges and told him to give breezy a
job as office-boy nothing was heard of
him for about four months then one day
breezy was in the office by himself when
the telephone-bell rang he hustled over
to it

   this the b and d  he heard

   yes sir whos this

   adams  co weve five cars of
chicks for chicago can you take em
breezy whistled the c c wasnt
down but he had accidentally heard once
that the company had been trying to get
adams  cos business for a long while
lie did some quick thinking

  well came impatiently over the
wire

  give me your number ill let you
know in ten minutes then he called
up the freight-house

   anybody down there 

   no one but tlie watchmen and two
day men sir

  breezy scratched his head  hold the
day men this is the superintendents
office there will be five cars of chicks
out to-day from adams  co for chi-
cago get the empties from the yard and
put them alongside the freight-platform
hustle

  exchange give me d o he
asked this the train-masters office
 yes  whos this 

   the superintendent mr darrell
his voice grew gruff therell be five

cars of chicks to go on  hold  one
hour if necessary then switch the cars out
with her

  hold  why mr darrell-

  so the bluff worked - dannys throat
almost burst in his endeavor to speak
more gruffly  i said hold  one hour
isnt that plain enough

   all right sir d o rang off grum-
bling

  then breezy did some more quick
thinking the crack fast freight of the

b	and d r r-no -was due
to leave at  pm it was now 
thirty minutes to load and send the
chicks down to the station one hour to
load them in the car that made  thirty
minutes late

  just then the phone rang breezy
jumped for it well
superintendents office

    yes sir  what it is 

  those five cars of chicks-
  well

   we cant get any empties no en-
gine to switch a car it was the freight-
house

  breezy groaned then had an inspira-
tion

   all right ill attend to that tele-
phone me when the cars reach the plat-
form and when theyre loaded then he
rang off and called again  d o
please then after a little wait  hul-
lo d o

   yes sir

  this is mr darrell run a switch-
engine out quick to the east yard to take
five empties to the west-bound platform
telephone me when it leaves and do it
quick   breezvs voice was eommand-
ingly deep

  all right sir

  then he called up adams  co  are
those chickens loaded  

   yes all ready

   send em down then  well take em
on 

  the man at the other end was silent
for a moment  whos this he asked
breezy modestly gave his name  we
wont forget you assured the other
breezy thanked him then rang off

  d	o rang up  no engine in service
but  they reported

   l ake that he ordered desperately
then he sat down and drew a deep


the railroad mans magazine

breath he was in all the way over and
he might as well see it through

  in three minutes the bell rang again

  those chicks just arrived reported
the freight-house  two men on the
wagon are helping us load them

   how long will it take

   about an hour sir

   all right ill give you thirty min-
utes the engine will be there then

   well try its pretty quick work
though

  the next thirty minutes breezy lived
in suspense and when the telephone-bell
rang he almost jumped for it  yes
he asked eagerly

   ninety-seven is just leaving he
heard  theyve got the chicks

  breezy heard some one enter the office
and stop behind him but resisted the de-
sire to turn

   you did very well he gruffly spoke
 thank you the other fellow rang
off and breezy turned to the newcomer
it was the chief clerk

   who was it   asked swidges

  breezy explained matters to him the
c c went up in the air he was a hard
man and had never forgiven breezy for
going over his head to get a job he
finished by telling breezy he would report
the whole thing to the superintendent
mr darrell the next morning the
superintendent came out of his office to
the c cs desk and breezy prepared for
a storm

   that was pretty good work of yours
yesterday swidges he said

  the c c glanced up  whats
that

   those chickens on  yesterday
answered the superintendent

  breezys heart jumped now for the
storm

   oh yes answered the c c care-
lessly   had to figure pretty closely
on it too

   the traffic department called me up
yesterday evening and told me about it
explained the superintendent  they
say itll give us a big lot of trade in the
commission field you did splendidly
he walked in his office again

  then breezy understood that the c c
hadnt told him the truth but he made up
his mind to keep quiet just because he
did swidges disliked him all the more

  it was bard for breezy to keep still
however - one day he suggested to
swidges that by a change of stenog-
raphers on different desks they could save
the salary of an extra man the c c
told him angrily that he wasnt put there
to make suggestions the next time he
did it he would be fired

  then a long report was made to the
president thegeneral manager and the
genera superintendent of the delays to
trains on all divisions breezy saw where
the reports could be cut out and a daily
morning report made which would not
only be up to the minute but only take
a few minutes to make

  he told the train-report man about it
who told the c c generously giving
breezy the credit the change was made
but the c c called breezy up and told
him that after this he either had to attend
altogether to his own work or quit

  that kind of thing would have dis-
couraged anybody with feelings but
breezy apparently didnt have em

  the temptation to have a hand in run-
ning the road was irresistible one din-
ner hour when the freight-office called
up to get the routing of a car and every-
body was at lunch breezy who had been
shown how to get routes by the routing
clerk after hunting diligently gave the
necessary instructions

  three days later the traffic department
called up the superintendents office the
chief clerk answered the phone and after
quite a lengthy conversation went in the
superintendents office	

  then he came out again called the
routing clerk and retired with him to the
sanctuary again by this time the office
was listening wide-eared breezy was
wondering what it was all about when
the echoes of a heated argument came
through the door of the superintendents
office followed by the routing clerk
flushed with anger

  the train-report man who was an old
friend of his stopped him as he passed
 what is it he asked

  the routing clerk was still angry
 that fool swidges lie loudly declared
 he wants to tell me i sent a trial ship-
ment out of route green  co gave us
a trial shipment for c v delivery and
told us to hold for special instructions
now swidges wants to tell me that i
letters of an old railroad man and his son 

wrr h-atc k

this boy has done more

to destroy obedience than
any man weve ever had

sent it without instructions and were go-
ing to lose all their competitive business
breezy suddenly remembered the car
he had routed a few days before he
was up in a second and hustled inside
the superintendents office

  the c c was just getting up to come
out the superintendent was facing the
door  mr swidges said breezv  i
did that

   did what  

   routed that car b and d and
c v

   you  exploded the chief clerk
breezy nodded everybody was out
of the office he explained li and the
freight-house-

  i dont want your excuses the

c	cs voice shook with anger he
grasped breezys arm  mr darrell
this boy has done more to destroy obe-
dience in this office than any man weve

ever had-up here i think its time to let
him out

  breezy pulled his arm away and his
face flushed but he did not answer the
superintendent looked gravely at him for
a moment then he spoke

   who told you to route the car that
way  he asked

  no one was in here at lunch-time but
myself he explained  and the freight-
house called up and said  was made up
with this car and they wanted a routing
as she would leave in ten minutes and i
told them to send it via cumberland val-
ley

  the superintendent looked at the chief
clerk he shook his head  the traffic
department are in the air about it he
said  its not his-fault in a way but-
the telephone rang and he broke off

   yes yes this is mr darrell they
hearct
sos

the railroad mans magazine

   mr green oh yes green  co
that was the firm that had shipped the
car what was coining now breezy won-
dered

   we are very sorry mr green-
what-delivered no i didnt know
that they called me up all right
thank you sir he hung up the re-
ceiver

   that was dan green he said to
swidges then he motioned to breezy
to leave the room

  when the chief clerk cme out from
the inner office he said nothing to breezy
or the routing clerk who was still smol-
dering at his desk lie began dictating
and breezy got up and went to his desk
 say mr swidges-

   go to your work said the chief clerk
harshly

  the next day breezy heard the full
story the shipping man of green 
co had called up the traffic department
to give them instructions for routing and
when he was told that the car had been
shipped by another route he immediately
notified the traffic department that it
would mean the loss of their entire com-
petitive business whereupon the traffic
department had called up the chief clerk
and notified him to that effect

  almost at the same time green  co
had received notice of the delivery of the
car to the c v and the time three days
was so startling that the head of the firm
had called up the superintendent and traf-
fic department and after congratulating
them promised them all their business

  while the results were good the in-
creased dislike of the chief clerk rendered
breezys position almost unbearable and
he was more uncomfortable because the
routing clerk wouldnt let him come near
the routing desk again it drove him to
spend much of his time in the yards
where he got a lot of valuable experience
that he would never have learned in the
office

  the peach season came on for ten
years the p f r r had cornered all
the peach movement from the south
though their service was generally poor
their facilities rotten and they steadily
refused to improve them

  the southern peaches amounted in
season to as high as fifty cars a day and
the revenue was a nice little sum but

somehow nobody had been able toget it
away from the p f r r

  this year however the b and d got
after the business the result of the
traffic departments work was a request
on the general superintendent to run a
daily train of two cars of peaches over
the b and d there wasnt any profit
running two cars special particularly to
new york markets to which point there
was always a heavy run of traffic-unless
the traffic department could guarantee
that the amount would increase

 the traffic department very politely
declined to guarantee anything more than
two cars finally the papers drifted
down to the new york superintendent for
schedule over his division and he after
talking it over with his men declined to
offer anything but movement on the regu-
lar local when connection could be made

  naturally the question was talked
about a good deal and breezy out of
curiosity got the papers and looked them
over they contained a lengthy state-
ment of existing conditions written by
the traffic department and also a sched-
ule of southern connections given by the
commercial agent at atlanta

  breezy after reading the correspond-
ence over decided that his road was be-
ing robbed of traffic that rightly belonged
to it that made him mad and gave him
an idea

  he went out on an unofficial inspection
of the p f r r then he saw his
friend the train-report man and got him
to make up a schedule of special move-
ment over the new york division

  as the peaches were delivered at wash-
ington practically the entire movement
lay with the new york division except
for forty miles and remembering what
the commercial agent at atlanta had said
breezy showed his friend that the
peaches could leave anacostia junction
just outside of washington and where
they were delivered   in time to con-
nect with a special and make early morn-
ing delivery in new york-something the
p f r r had not done for six years
and meaning practically forty-eight hours
from the south to new york

  then the b and d had a big pier
practically unused the p fs pier
was too small to accommodate all the
traffic breezy explained that lie had seen
letters of- an old railroad man and his son 

that himself and had heard the buyers
complaining about it another advan-
tage was that the b and d pier was near
the commission district well lighted and
with first-class accommodations for the
produce trade wouldnt his friend help
he had an idea

  his friend the train-report man be-
came enthusiastic whejvlie heard the great
idea and helped him to make up not

from the grinning buyer a promise that
if he got other names to the paper in his
pocket he would give in his signature
the next day he went to see another man
when breezy told him his name the man
thought a moment then said

   didnt you take some chickens for us
to chicago some time ago im mr
adams

   yes sir

i wont tell you what i think of you

only a statement of existing conditions
but also a statement of guaranteed forty-
eight-hour movement from the south to
new york city on the part of the b
and d

   with the caution to him not to tell any-
one breezy slipped out he went to the
auction sales and followed the largest
buyers and commission people to their
stores then one day he came down to
work dressed in his best suit during
the lunch-hour he disappeared as usual
and went to one of the men he had tracked
down

  he talked with him earnestly con-
vincingly and forcibly and after a for-
ty-five-minute conversation extracted

  well we owe you something for
that what can i do for you

  breezy explained his plan the man
asked him question after question and
when breezy produced the schedule that
his friend the train-report man had pre-
pared mr adams promptly signed his
name

  bidding breezy wait he dictated a let-
ter which he handed to breezy telling
him to give it to the first man he had
seen that gentleman after reading the
letter looked over breezy curiously and
after talking to him a little while added
his name

  when reezy showed the train-report
man those two names that gentleman


the railroad mans magazine

gasped the great idea was making a hit
at last 

  the next day breezy got two of the
largest commission men who signed when
they saw the names he had secured

  then the following day he got two
more names-both of them first tele-
phoning adams  co-and the great
work was done they were the control-
ling members of the produce exchange
and with them for a lead every small
buyer would follow

  breezy determined to make it sure
however and on the sixth day he landed
the president of the produce exchange

  he returned to the office fifteen min-
utes late the c c called him over
 this makes the fifth time youve been
late this week you can go

  breezy looked puzzled go go
where he asked

   go anywhere youre fired

  breezy looked at him in amazement
 but mr swidges-

   i dont want any excuses get out 
interrupted the c c and turning to his
stenographer began dictating

  breezy stared at him still dazed
 mr swidges ive got the names here-

  the c c looked up  havent you
gone yet do you want to be put out 

  then rage suddenly entered breezys
heart  i wont tell you what i think
of you   he exclaimed and ere the sur-
prised c c could gather his wits breezy
seized his hat and departed hastily

  he walked home with his head up
discouraged not he he was just mad
-mad clear through after all he had
done- then the dust bothered his eyes
and he rubbed it out hastily

  then he took his case in his own hands
the next day he called on the general
superintendent

   i want to show you a paper in my
possession he said

   sorry to hear you were fired said
the g s

   so am i replied breezy smiling

   lets see your paper breezy pro-
duced it the g s looked at it his
eyes opened wide he handed it to dar-
rell  weve been trying for ten years
jo get that traffic and this boy stepped in
and got it in five days

  the superintendent read the names

to be

signed to it then he whistled  by
george  he cried  why didnt i think
of this before

    why didnt any of us think of it be-
fore  said the g s  no the boy has
got sound common sense then his
voice sharpened  mr darrell explain
to your chief clerk what vou want him
for

  the superintendent turned to the c

c	who was already shrinking

   how many passes have you sold
since you have been with us swidges
he asked suddenly

  the c c turned as white as a sheet
he tried to speak but couldnt the
superintendent produced a paper from his
pocket

   weve found two hundred here so
far maybe you can add to the list
he turned to the g s  by the way
he said do you remember that adams
 co gave us all their business  ac-
count of some chicks we moved for them
some time ago

   well they telephoned me this morn-
ing that this boy was the one that ar-
ranged the movement for them

   he indicated breezy with a wave of his
hand

   yes answered the g s  i know
that and a lot more he turned to
breezy how old are you danny
he asked

    twenty sir

  the g s thought for a moment
 im going to take this boy darrell he
said then he turned to the c c-but
the c c had disappeared

  the superintendent glanced inquiring-
ly at his chief  let him go said
thomas  maybe the poor fellow-
then he stopped and spoke to breezy
again  i want you to report at my of-
fice to-morrow danny

  do you know where danny is to-day
hes third vice-president of the b and

d	and i guess you see him almost every
day if hed allowed himself to be dis-
couraged where would he have landed
its the fellow who climbs over the rocks
in the road that gets where lies going
and not the man who sits down and weeps
when he runs into anything that looks a
little hard

           old purdue drove crippled  to her des-
           tination after a braver man had jumped

our drowsy engine crews
cursing at the unex-
pected summons of the
caller lounged sleepily
in the despatchers of-

little after midnight the air was pun-
gent with the smell of burning pine
and the men coughed as the bitter smoke
bit their lungs behind the eight men
there skulked a great hulking fellow
whom none of the rest seemed to notice

  suddenly the despatcher and the su-
perintendent of the division to the east
burst into the room the two eyed the
enginemen a moment and then the des-
patcher said

   men i have called you all for i
want a crew to volunteer to take a fast
engine and two cars up to the lost
horse mine one car will be loaded
with italian miners the other will carry
tools and dynamite  will not order
any crew to go nor any man the for-

  he paused and there were sleepy
curses in comment he eyed them again
and again spoke slowly

   i ask for these volunteers because
there was a cave-in at the lost horse
mine an hour ago and the whole night-
shift is entombed the day-shift is de-
moralized and the dynamite that should
have been put oif at the siding there
last night is in the yards here with-
out it the work of rescue cannot be
done they are perhaps only dagoes-
but they are men now who will go
gallipel the oldest of the engineers
lifted his voice

   and you want some of us fellers
to go up there and git blowed up in the
snow-sheds eh well  wont go
certain of his position with the su-
perintendent gallipel stumbled out his
fireman followed him jones the next
oldest and trusted -engineer stepped for-
ward 

   id do it in a minute sir but you
know mv wifes an invalid and there is
all my kids

   i wouldnt want you to go jones
the superintendent answered jones and
his fireman stood aside

  masterson the daredevil of the divi-
sion stepped forward

   i caint go i wont go up against
a thing where they haint no chance
leave off the giant and ill pull her

   but the giant must go for the train
goes to save the miners in the cave-in
we are not sending up there to add more
to the number that now sit round and
hold their hands  the superintendent
spoke sharply masterson with a self-
satisfied smile stood aside with his fire-
man

  parkman the last of the four stepped
out hung his head and stammered

    i aint agoin

  the superintendent said nothing and
parkman and his fireman stood with the
others who had refused

  the hulking giant who had skulked
behind now shambled forward he tried
to square his shoulders but they drooped
quickly he tried to hold up his head
but he only jerked his chin his eyes

blinked like those of an animal threat-
ened with blows on the face and his
lips opened and closed without a word
there was something piteous in his atti-
tude the superintendent spoke not un-
kindly 

   il purdue the caller only brought you
because i forgot to tell him there was
no use	v

   the coarse hands of the giant fluttered
for an instant and then he found his
voice

    id like to have the chance

   the superintendent smiled in spite of
himself and masterson snorted with
vast incredulity

    old purdue 

  the gravest and most sympathetic
smiled the others roared

  the superintendent recovered his
equanimity and studied the frightened
face of the man before him then he
said slowly

    purdue you have been eligible for
an engine now for fourteen years you
know your record as well as any of us
as a fireman you jumped half a doz-
en times when there never was a wreck
you never could have an engine on a
regular run under me you could not
have this one if there was any one else
to go

   but we have promised the manager
of the lost horse the men and powder if
we could get a crew to pull the train find
you a fireman inside of twenty minutes
and remember that if you jump this
time you will never go back to tlife
roundhouse even as a wiper

   old purdue tottered out without stop-
ping to ask his favor of any of the fire-
men present as he passed they saw
his face was white as chalk and that he
was trembling from head to foot

  the outcome w-as pleasing to the
crews that had refused to go it would
have to be developed by old purdue-
the grotesque and farcical old purdue
the man who hadnt sufficient nerve to
fire the engine on a work train

  it was a joke to be enjoyed beneath
the noses of the superintendent and the
despatcher

  the superintendent listened to them
for an instant and then his voice cut like
a knife

   and when it is explained why no
the lost horse limited	

help came to the entombed men it will
appear that even a coward like old
purdue would have pulled the train
but all other enginemen were greater
cowards and he could not get a man
to give him steam

  masters on sprang forward with
clenched fists and angry face and cried
 if hell give me steam ill handle
her

  the superintendent ran to the door
and called old purdue he came and
stood frightened with his cap in his hand
as if he feared permission had been
given to some one else

   masterson has agreed to handle the
engine purdue if you will fire for him
will you do that

  old purdues chin shook and his hands
worked nervously as he an-
swered 

   id be glad to fire for
masterson hes a braver
man than me

  the comparison struck the
risibilities of the crowd and
all guffawed save masterson

  masterson was mad he
growled

   and ill let you fire for
me because you are a blun-
derin ass-and because i
might make a man of you

and if you open your head
agin here in this crowd like
that ill punch it for you

  what might have resulted
in horse - play was side-
tracked for the superintend-
ent lifted awarning hand and
cautioned the men to remem-
ber that this was an expedi-
tion to save the lives of men

the swing to the gravity of
the occasion was accom-
plished when the despatcher
who had gone to the key for
a moment returned with the
word

  all hope of rescue from
the other side is gone the
bridge over buffalo river
has burned carriton siding
reports that the trestle over
carriton creek is likely to
catch fire at any time and
he says that from his win-

   	r r

dow he can see the fire licking away at
the spruce next the snow-sheds hurry
or the debris will block the way 

  without more ado the whole party
dashed down the stairs to the platform
outside the night was thick but over
in the east there was the red glow of
the fires and every now and then a puff
of wind brought clouds of pungent
smoke and heat

  down by the roundhouse an engine
gave two warning blasts and then
dashed up to the platform on which they
stood it paused and leaving a car
passed on

   the dynamite  the superintendent
muttered

  the engine shot by them backing
down on a switch and a moment later


the railroad mans magazine

came tearing forward again with another
car through the rude windows of which
there gleamed faint lights that was
the car containing the miners then
from down at the roundhouse came a
mighty wail and the steady tolling of
a bell and all murmured  old 

  an instant later  came rumbling
down the switch paused and backed
down to the coupling with the rescue

turned to the crouching and fear-struck
volunteer and thundered

   old man its a race fur life give
her steam give her steam give her all
there is in her for ill use it all and
if you start to jump ill brain you
he turned and steadily opened the
throttle to the last notch and the speed
became terrific old purdue looked out
into the flying night and it seemed as if

train masterson grumbled some sort
of thanks for the best engine on the
division-the heaviest and fastest of the
heavy and fast for which that mountain
division was celebrated-and then clam-
bered proudly to his seat

  old purdue climbed in mechanically
and did not turn his face to them
in response to the throttle  swung
slowly ahead but old purdue did not
look out nor did he notice the men who
cheered masterson

  when the last frog had rattled be-
neath the pounding drivers masterson

 -the old desire to jump would master him
 but the shame and contumely of the past
 held him back with a stronger hand

   mechanically he got the shovel going
 and fired carefully the dread of death
 had passed in old purdue-he had suf-
 fered its acutest agonies he fired as
 masterson had never seen a man fire be-
 fore

   old  leaped along like a thing gone
 mad until she took the grade there
 the steep ascent cut down her speed but
 she was flying with the swiftness of an
 express masterson reckless though lie
lhe lost horse limited



 was eased down the throttle notch by
 notch

   the steam in the gage showed 
    by five-pound advances
 the hand went round until  showed-
 and old purdue mechanically shoveled
 in the coal and mechanically swung to the
 door with lightning-like precision mas-
 terson leaped across the cab and yelled
 like a madman

   hold up cant you see the gage
 youll bust her biler we dont need
 steam going down drop that shovel or
 ill brain you  

   old purdue leaned against his side of
 the swaying cab and took a deep draft
 of the smoky air he looked forward
 and for the first time saw the fire ahead
 the glow in the sky just over the grade
 was just what he had seen when the
 prairie burns by night in an instant
 they had topped the grade and were
 dashing down

   ahead there was an arch of leaping
 flames that swung like a low-flung ban-
 ner squarely across the tracks on either
 side as far as the eye could penetrate
 the lurid palls of fire leaped and burled
 upward and billowed in vast waves of
 smoke like a tempestrswept infernal sea

   with an oath masterson threw on the
 air and reckless of the consequence to
  threw her over into the reverse old
 purdue aware of what was going on
 reeled back from the boiler against
 which the shock had thrown him and
 hesitatingly yelled

   aint you goin on

   not on your life a man would
 be a fool ill back her iu home to
 crags

   old purdue shifted his feet as the en-
 gine slowed down and then on a sudden
 he threw up his head and hand 

    i volunteered to take the train-and
the train is goin  with that lie threw
her over into the forward shifted the
air and opened the throttle with a jerk

   masterson struck once and ineffectual-
 ly at him and with a frightened glance
 at the burning sheds jumped

   old purdue leaped up to the throttle
 side and craning his head far out
 studied the blazing bow toward which
 he was hurling as yet no timbers were
 sagging nothing prevented his safe pas-
 sage through unless parts of the frame-

 work should give way as he advanced
 he thought of the possibility of the
 povvder-car catching fire and opened the
 sand pipes lo give him greater speed

  the pilot entered the flaming portal
and old purdue slipped over behind the
fire-box and began shoveling coal he
counted eight shovels and looking up
saw no walls of flame about the cab

  he looked again to the mounting
gage and then clambered onto the ten-
der he got the water-bucket and fill-
ing it crawled out onto the top of the
car containing the men

  from that position he saw that the
roof of the car behind was blazing in
two places-and the speed was fanning
the flames

  he balanced his bucket ran nimbly
along the reeling deck of one car and
leaped to that of the other at the first
flame he spilled most of the water and
put out the fire there he went back
to the other and fought that with his
hands

  when the last ember was gone he ran
back again but even as he leaped to
the deck of the miners car a gust of
flame swept up between

  he stumbled across the tender and
shut down he filled his bucket and
once more ran back and tins time clam-
bered to the ground as he stood by
the blazing trucks that threatened each
breathless second to ignite the terrible
cargo above he beat on the end of the
car ahead and cried

    out there  out--and help  

  in a moment the ground around him
was swarming with the frightened ital-
ians he fought the fire with his bucket
coming back each time with it replen-
ished certain that each time would be
the last before the explosion would end
it all and then seeing he could make
no headway alone he ran to the cab and
seizing the coal-liammer drove the cow-
ards to the work and made them beat
the flames

  when that was done he drove them
back into their car then with reeling
brain he crawled into the cab dimly
conscious of the fact that  was leak-
ing steam at joints that never had been
known to give and that her safety-valve
was roaring louder than the flames

   he opened her throttle easily fearful


the railroad mans magazine

of the high pressure against the half-
cooled cylinders she moved off slowly
and for some unexplained reason did
not gather speed he threw the throttle
open wider but she only took the pace
of an old freighter

  purdue looked at the gage and saw
that the steam was down to a hundred
he looked far ahead and saw that the
trestle over carriton was a mass of flame

  without pausing he bent to the task
of making steam shovelful after shovel-
ful he scattered in until a little more
would have choked the draft

  then  began to take on life again
old pardue was glorying in her speed

  he looked forward again the trestle
was close at hand his heart leaped as
he saw that the rails lay true the whole
way across and that none of the ties
were burned off

  he pulled at the throttle striving to
open it beyond its limit and just as
the thing seemed done there came a
splitting crash and  trembled from
peak to pilot and her left-hand cab-
side vanished

  she jolted for a hundred yards or so
and came to a stop

  old purdue knew that keys came out
of drivers and that when they did con-
necting - rods spinning like windmill-
sails demolished whatever they touched

  he looked at the flaming trestle and
with a torrent of oaths got crowbar and
wrenches and once more summoned the
men they came forth gladly all of
them they loosened the nuts as he
directed them and they helped pry the
connecting-rod loose

  he ordered them to get in again but
they ran away

  old purdue heaved a sigh that was
half relief and again he crawled into
the cab of  he made more steam and
slowly opened the throttle but she was
on center-the other cylinder was dead

  he got down and with his crowbar
pinched her a little way enough to give
her head

  again he clambered to his seat and
gave her steam she took it like the
cripple that she was and hobbled off he
watched her carefully and saw her
gathering speed and then he made more
steam

  out onto the quaking trestle the

crippled train dragged its way the
timbers beneath cracked and some of
them fell down sending up embers and
clouds of sparks andsullen sounds the
heat grew terrific the cab was full of the
smell of blistering paint and the roar of
the flames was mighty

  but old purdue who had passed the
fear of death mechanically shovelectcoal

  at length crawling crippling and
thumping with her one cylinder 
gained the far approach-she groaned
on a little farther and the train was clear

  old purdue shut down and went back
again with his bucket to put out the fire
that he knew would be burning under
the car of dynamite it was there and
again he fought it time and again he
dashed to and fro the strength of the
mans body was gone but the will of old
purdue drove him on

  all the profitless life of the man was
focused in this pressing moment to accom-
plish what other men might not accom-
plish in years

  suddenly from the lurid darkness be-
side him the mining crew began sham-
bling near he heard them

  but this time old purdue did not
need the coal - hammer to drive them
he had gained a quality he had be-
come a man to lead and to command

  he shouted and they ran to him he
bawled ins orders and they faced death
to do them 

  when the fire was out he made them
pinch the right-hand drivers over far
enough to let her have a head of steam
before he loaded them into their car
he selected a strong fellow to shovel coal
and again they crippled on

  about forty minutes later old pur-
due whistled into the siding at the lost
horse mine and more dead than alive
sat down in the shanty where the opera-
tor was ticking away to tell how the
train had arrived in charge of the man
who had started out to fire the trip aft-
er a long interchange of ticking the tele-
grapher handed him a paper

  it was a message of thanks from the

superintendent he was glad that there

wassuch a man on the division and all
that old purdue didnt make much fuss
over it however what was greater than
all the praise and adulation was the
knowledge that at last he was a man
progress in locomotive
building

by john t walters

the improvements that busy minds are devising- to make the american
locomotive faster and stronger rank well up in line with the best
achievements of to-day

     since the old eight-wheel or american type in  the steam-engine
lias gone through successive stages of betterment until to-day we have the
marvelous greyhound of the rails with her walschaert valve-gear super-
heated steam improved superheaters and other new things and the end is
not yet let him who thinks that the time of the locomotive is on the wane
read this-and change his mind

    we are indebted to the american locomotive company for some of the
information given in this article

the past thirty years has been the period of the locomotives
greatest development-the importance of the walschaert valve-
gear and superheated steam in recent construction

jftajfrerore -the year of the
centennial exposition at
philadelphia-american lo-
icomotive practise had be-
come to a certain extent
standardized and certain
types had been generally adopted for the
various classes of service

  for fast passenger service the eight-
wheel or american type was almost uni-
versally used at that time this type was
also used to some extent in freight serv
ice where the requirements demanded a
greater power than could be provided with
the four coupled wheels of the american
type the ten-wheel type with six coupled
driving-wheels and a four-wheel leading
truck was employed

  this latter type was also extensively
used in freight service and as at the
present time was considered a very sat
isfactory type for mixed service-that is
either passenger or freight

in freight service the mogul type with



six coupled driving-wheels and a two-
wheel leading truck and the consolida-
tion type which was a development of
the former by the addition of another pair
of driving-wheels were generally used

  at this time the eight-wheel type had
attained a total weight of seventy  five
thousand pounds and the hauling of
three hundred and thirty-six tons  a
level road at an average speed of thirty-
five miles an hour without stops was con-
sidered a very good record in passenger
service

  when we compare such engines with
those built by the american locomotive
company weighing two hundred and
twenty-six thousand pounds which to-day
handle the twentieth century limited-
the eighteeurhour train between tyew york
and chicago-and maintain a speed of
sixty miles an hour over a level road with
a train of six hundred tons we realize the
tremendous growth of the locomotive
during the past thirty years


the railroad mans magazine

  in the ten-wheel mogul and consolida-
tion types weights of   and
 pounds respectively were com-
mon to-day the american locomotive
company is building a freight-locomotive
for the delaware and hudson company
which will weigh  pounds

ten-years development

  from  to  there was a great
increase in the weight and power of loco-
motives the development was along
well-established lines there was little de-
parture from standard practise and no
new principles were introduced

  this period however saw the intro-
duction of a new type of wheel arrange-
ment-the decapod so called because it
had ten driving-wheels like the con-
solidation type the decapod had a two-
wheel leading truck and was merely a
development of the former type to meet
special conditions and provide greater
power without overloading the rails

  about this time however a very dis-
tinct departure was made from existing
locomotive practise by the introduction
of the compound principle hitherto
american locomotive designers had given
little attention to improving the efficiency
of the locomotive but now the demand
arose for greater economy in operation

  compounding was universally used in
marine and stationary practise where
high duty and great economy were de-
sired and this principle had also been
employed in locomotive practise in eu-
rope with more or less success

  in the effort to satisfy the demand for
saving in coal and water locomotive de-
signers in this country naturally turned
their attention to the development of a
compound locomotive adapted to ameri-
can conditions in  the baldwin
locomotive works brought out a com-
pound locomotive built after designs
by s m vauclain of that company

the first compounding

  this system of compounding was first
applied to an eight-wheel engine built
for the baltimore and ohio railroad
and employed the use of four cylinders-
a high and low pressure cylinder on each
side of the engine

  the two cylinders on each side were
placed one above the other and both pis-
tons were connected to the same cross-
head the steam distribution to the two
cylinders on each side was controlled by
a single hollow piston-valve operated by
the ordinary form of stephenson shifting-
link motion

  a device was provided consisting of a
three-way cock operated by the engineer
by means of which in starting steam from
the boiler was allowed to pass from one
end of the high-pressure cylinder to the
other and thence through the valve to the
steam end of the low-pressure cylinder

  a large number of locomotives of this
type were built but the economies ef-
fected in coal and water consumption
were offset by an increased cost of main-
tenance due largely to the use of a single
cross-head for the high and low pressure
cylinders

  as the power in the cylinders was not
equal the cross-head was subjected to un-
equal strains causing in many cases fail-
ure of that part and making it impossible
to keep the piston-rod packing tight

the vauclain four-cylinder

  because of these objectionable features
of design the vauclain four - cylinder
compound is but little used to-day but
it was among the first compound locomo-
tives to meet with any success in this
country and constitutes one of the most
important steps in the development of
the modern american locomotive

  in the same year that the vauclain
four-cylinder compound was introduced
the schenectady locomotive works
brought out a two - cylinder compound
engine built under patents granted to
a j pitkin

  the feature of this system of- com-
pounding was the intercepting - valve
which was so designed as to admit live
steam at reduced pressure into the low-
pressure cylinder in starting and prevent
the pressure backing up against the high-
pressure piston and to automatically
change to the compound position when
the pressure in the receiver-pipe located
in the smoke-box reached a certain
amount

  this system also included a so-called
separate exhaust-valve operated by the
progress in locomotive building	

engineer which permitted the exhaust
steam from the high-pressure cylinder to
be diverted directly to the stack and the
locomotive operated as a single-expansion
engine with materially increased power

  one of the first examples of this type of
compound was built for the michigan
central railroad and its performance
was very satisfactory like all the earlier
types of compounds however it has seen
its day and few of this type are now
built 

  another type of two-cylinder compound
engine was scon after brought out by the
richmond locomotive works in which
the mellin system was employed

  the richmond compound was iden-
tical in principle with the schenectady
compound but differed essentially from
the latter in the design of the intercepting
and separate exhaust-valve from the
standpoints of simplicity of design and
operation economy of fuel and water
and low cost of maintenance it has
proved very successful

  though as applied to two-cylinder en-
gines the use of the richmond or mellin
system of compounding is at the present
time limited this same system is a dis-
tinctive feature of the mallet articulated-
compound locomotives built by the amer-
ican locomotive company which type
will be considered later

the compounds future

  the introduction of the compound en-
gine may be considered largely responsible
for another important improvement in
american locomotive design-namely the
use of the piston-valve

  as the locomotive increased in size and
power and larger cylinders were used
the valves controlling the distribution of
steam to the cylinders were necessarily-
made larger in order to admit larger vol-
umes of steam

  at this time the flat side-valve even in
simple engines had reached such propor-
tions that difficulty was experienced in
perfectly balancing it the unbalanced
weight of the-valve put a great strain on
the gear causing the parts to spring if
not to break and also made it hard to
handle the reverse-lever

  the combined effort of the engineer
and fireman was often required to  hook

up  the reverse-lever to overcome these
difficulties it became necessary to evolve
some new design of valve and the cylin-
drical form commonly known as the pis-
ton-valve in which the pressure on al
sides was equal giving almost perfect bal-
ance was introduced

  although the first instance of the use
of the piston-valve on an american loco-
motive antedated the introduction of the
compound its first successful application
was in the case of the vauclain four-
cylinder compound locomotive where it
was necessarily employed

  on two-cylinder compound locomotives
the piston-valve soon came into general
use

making engines simpler

   in the application of his type of valve
to simple locomotives the brooks loco-
motive works took the lead of other loco-
motive-bu i lders

  tht many advantages of the piston-
valve over the balanced slide-valve par-
ticularly its nearly perfect balance and its
adaptability to any type of valve-gear
have led to its general use at the present
time on simple as well as compound en-
gines although some motive-power men
still prefer the latter type the design of
which has been improved so as to give
more perfect balance

  about the time that the early types of
compound locomotives were being devel-
oped the requirements of passenger serv-
ice had become so severe that they had
almost outgrown the capacities of the then
favorite types of passenger-engines

  in  the eight-wheel passenger-en-
gine had reached its highest development
in the class represented by the famous
locomotive no  of the new york
central lines which was exhibited at the
worlds fair in chicago

  as the speed of passenger-trains in-
creased locomotives were required with a
larger steam-making capacity than could
be provided in the eight-wheel type in
this type with the larger driving-wheels
required for high-speed service the fire-
box is necessarily placed between the
driving-wheels and the amount of grate
area available is consequently limited
not only is the grate area limited but
also the heating surface


the railroad mans magazine

  in order to secure a larger boiler and
sufficient grate area to provide for the
large fuel consumption required in fast
passenger service a new type of wheel
arrangement was introduced in  by
the baldwin locomotive works this
was called the columbia type and had a
two-wheel leading truck four coupled
driving - wheels and a pair of trailing
wheels over which the fire-box was
placed

advantage of trailers

  the advantage of the use of trailing
wheels in this design was quickly recog-
nized they permitted a large grate area
in a satisfactory design of wide fire-box
adapted to burning soft coal by placing
the fire-box over these wheels the co-
lumbia type though not itself extensively
adopted was the forerunner of the types
of engines which have since become the
favorites for high-speed passenger service

  soon after the columbia type appeared
the atlantic type with a four-wheel lead-
ing truck four coupled driving-wheels
and two-wheel trailing truck was intro-
duced and soon became popular super-
seding the eight-wheel type

  in  the brooks locomotive works
introduced another type of high duty pas-
senger-engine having a two-wheel lead-
ing truck six coupled driving-wheels and
a pair of trailing wheels the first exam-
ples of this type called the prairie were
built for the lake shore and michigan
southern railway on which road it be-
came the favorite type of passenger-en-
gine

  owing to the fact that most motive-
power men consider a four-wheel leading
truck essential to safety for an engine run
at high speeds the prairie type was never
very extensively employed in passenger
service but is largely used in freight serv-
ice

  when the weight of passenger-trains
outgrew the power that could be pro-
vided with only four coupled driving-
wheels the design of passenger - engine
known as the pacific type was introduced
this was a development of the atlantic
with an added pair of driving - wheels
this type is to-day the favorite for the
most severe passenger service and it
might be said has taken the place of its

predecessor tlie atlantic type on most of
the roads in this country

  during this period locomotive design-
ers had been endeavoring to improve the
compound locomotive

  the two-cylinder type had not met with
the success anticipated and although the
vauclain four-cylinder typewas quite ex-
tensively used its faults were clearly rec-
ognized

  in  the schenectady locomotive
works brought out a four-cylinder com-
pound in which the two cylinders on each
side were placed one ahead of the other
or in tandem and the two pistons were
mounted on a single piston-rod connected
with its cross-head

  a similar arrangement of cylinders had
been previously introduced by the brooks
locomotive works in  but had not
proved successful owing to certain com-
plex features of the valve arrangement

  in the schenectady tandem compound
these faults were corrected by setting
the cylinders tandem the power of both
cylinders was exerted along the same line
thus overcoming tlie most serious defects
in the vauclain four-cylinder compound
-namely the connecting of two cylinders
of unequal power and in different hori-
zontal planes with the same cross-head

  a number of this type of compound
were built but as has been the case with
all the earlier types of compound engines
it has been superseded by other and later
types

increase in weight

  the period from  to  saw an
enormous increase in the wreight and
power of both passenger and freight en-
gines a comparison between the engines
exhibited at tlie worlds fair in chicago
in the former year and the locomotives at
the louisiana purchase exposition in the
latter year showed that during these
eleven years the average total weight of
passenger-engines had increased fifty-one
per cent and the weight on driving-wheels
thirty-three per cent in the case of
freight-engines the increase in the aver-
age total weight was forty-six per cent
and fifty-four per cent on driving-wheels

  during this period the consolidation
type had become the standard heavy
freight-engine and had reached its pres-
progress in locomotive building



ent limit in power in two locomotives built
for the bessemer and lake erie railroad
in  by the pittsburgh locomotive
works these engines had a total weight
each of  pounds and the cylinders
were twenty-four inches in diameter and
thirty-two inches in stroke

  where the conditions required a greater
weight on driving-wheels than could be
provided in the consolidation type with-
out overloading the rail other types of
wheel arrangements were introduced

  notable among these was the famous
santa fe type so called because it was
first used on the atchison topeka and
santa fe railroad this type has a two-
wheel leading truck ten driving-wheels
and a trailing truck

  it reached its highest development in
the class represented by the tandem com-
pound locomotive built for the santa fe
by the baldwin locomotive works ex-
hibited at the st louis exposition which
had a total weight of  pounds

  the mikado type having a two-wheel
leading truck eight coupled driving-
wheels and a two-wheeled trailing truck
was also developed to meet special service
conditions and is now quite extensively
used in freight service

  on roads having long and steep grades
the increase in weight and power of the
standard freight-engine had at this time
created conditions which it was hard to
meet with the existing types of locomo-
tives

the mallet articulated

  in order to pull a train up these grades
which the road engine could easily handle
over the remainder of the road it was
often necessary to use several helpers or
pushing engines which entailed both ex-
pense and delay in moving the traffic

  to meet these conditions the american
locomotive company in  introduced
the mallet articulated-compound locomo-
tive this type of locomotive which de-
rived its name from its designer anatole
mallet a prominent french engineer had
been successfully used in mountainous
sections of europe for several years to
meet conditions analogous to those exist-
ing in this country

  it remained for the american loco-
motive company however to modify and

adapt this design to meet american re-
quirements

  this type is practically two locomo-
tives combined in one and employs two
sets of engines under one boiler there
are four cylinders compounded together
the two pairs of cylinders are connected
to independent groups of driving-wheels
the rear group of wheels which are
driven by the high-pressure cylinders is
carried in frames which are rigidly at-
tached to the boiler to which the cylin-
ders are also secured in the usual manner

  the front group of wheels with the
low-pressure cylinders are however car-
ried in frames which are not rigidly at-
tached to the boifer but which have a
center-pin connection with the rear group
being thus in effect a truck which is capa-
ble of swiveling radially around its pivot

weight equally distributed

 the advantage of this type of construc-
tion is that it provides a locomotive with
a short rigid wheel-base capable of easily
passing through curves of very short ra-
dius with the weight distributed over a
long total wheel-base and a large number
of axles so that an enormous total weight
can be provided without excessive weight
on the individual wheels

  the first engine of this type was built
for the baltimore and ohio railroad it
had twelve driving-wheels arranged in
two groups of six each its enormous
weight of  pounds exceeded any-
thing that had previously been dreamed of
as possible in a single engine

  at first railroad men spoke of it as
 freakish  and  monstrous and pre-
dicted all kinds of failures for it con-
trary to all predictions it has proved suc-
cessful from every standpoint and was
the forerunner of what to-day promises
to be the most efficient freight-engine of
the future

  on the baltimore and ohio this engine
soon earned the nickname  maud forc
the famous mule which could move any-
thing it went up against

  the articulated-compound type lends
itself very readily to the concentration of
enormous power in a single engine and
since its introduction a large number
have been built for various roads

the record for weight established by


the railroad mans magazine

the baltimore and ohio engine was soon
exceeded by the construction for the erie
railroad by the american locomotive
company of three engines of the articu-
lated type having sixteen driving-wheels
and a total weight of  pounds
each

  the baldwin locomotive works as al-
ready mentioned have recently built two
engines of this type for the southern pa-
cific having a total weight of 
pounds six more are under construction
by the american locomotive company
weighing  pounds each

  although originally introduced for
helping or pushing service the articulated
tvpe of locomotive has proved itself very
efficient as a road engine and offers the
possibility of increasing the capacity or
a division and moving the greatest amount
of traffic over the line at the least oper-
ating cost

what walschaert gear is

  the introduction of the mallet type of
locomotive led to another important in-
novation in american locomotive prac-
tise namely the use of the walschaert
valve-gear

  in the mallet type of locomotive the
flexible receiver-pipe between the high and
low pressure cylinders being located be-
tween the frames on the center line of
the engine it was impossible to use the
ordinary stephenson valve-gear the
walschaert valve-gear which is located
outside of the driving-wheels was con-
sequently applied to the baltimore and
ohio mallet engine

  this type of gear which derives its
name from the inventor egide wal-
schaert was patented in belgium in 
and soon became the standard type of
valve motion on the railroads of europe
even as the so-called stephenson shifting
link motion which was invented in eng-
land about the same time was adopted in
america

  although william mason one of the
most prominent of early american loco-
motive-builders had attempted to intro-
duce the walschaert valve-gear into
american locomotive practise in 
and had exhibited an engine -equipped
with that type of gear at the centennial
exposition he did not meet with any suc-

cess as he was ahead of his time and the
american railway world was not then
ready to adopt a new valve motion

  as the locomotive lias increased in
weight and power the parts of the valve-
gear have reached such proportions that
there is hardly room enough between the
frames of a modern heavy freight or pas-
senger engine for the accommodation of
a satisfactory design of stephenson valve-
gear

  with the stephenson valve-gear the
parts are so crowded together between
the frames that it is almost impossible
for the engineer to give them proper in-
spection or lubrication

  the application of the walschaert
valve-gear to the baltimore and ohio
mallet engine again directed the attention
of american locomotive designers to it as
a means of meeting present-day condi-
tions

  being located outside of the frames
this type of gear is perfectly accessible
for inspection and lubrication so that it is
much more easily maintained than the
stephenson gear moreover by remov-
ing the valve-gear from between the
frames a better opportunity is afforded
to introduce a strong system of frame-
bracing thus tending to reduce frame
failures

  the principal difference in action be-
tween the two types of gears is that the
walschaert valve - gear gives a constant
lead at all cut-offs while with the usual
construction of the stephenson valve-gear
the lead increases as the reverse lever is
 hooked  up

  the superior advantage of the wal-
schaert valve-gear over the stephenson
link motion in the matter of accessibility
has led to its use on all of the most im-
portant american railroads and to-day
it has almost taken the place of the ste-
phenson gear as the standard type of valve
motion

another improvement

  about the same time that the mallet
articulated - compound locomotive ap-
peared another important advance was
made in the development of the american
locomotive by the introduction of the
four-cylinder balanced compound loco-
motive
progress in locomotive building

  in all reciprocating engines some pro-
vision has to be made to counteract the
disturbing effects of the horizontal mov-
ing of reciprocating parts such as pis-
tons cross-heads etc in locomotives
having two crank-pins and main rods this
is accomplished by placing a certain
amount of weight over that required to
balance the revolving parts in the driving-
wheel counterbalances opposite the crank-
pin

  except when the piston is at either end
of the stroke this excess weight exerts a
vertical force due to the centrifugal ac-
tion which increases or decreases the nor-
mal pressure of the wheel on the rail ac-
cording as the counterbalance is below or
above the center of the wheel causing
what is commonly called the  hammer
blow

  the vertical force of this excess weight
is greatest when the counterbalance is at
the top or bottom quarter of its revolu-
tion in the modern high-speed passen-
ger-engine with its heavy reciprocating
parts this vertical force is frequently ex-
cessive and causes serious injury to the
track

  to overcome this difficulty european
locomotive designers had developed the
four-cylinder balanced compound loco-
motive in which the driving mechanism is
so arranged that the reciprocating weights
balance each other

  this type of engine also provided all
the advantages of the compound prin-
ciple in the way of increased capacity and
improved economy and offered the means
of meeting the increasing weights of
trains and severe requirements of service
without increasing the weight and size of
locomotives the limit of which seemed to
have already been reached

no increase in size

  american locomotive designers conse-
quently directed their-efforts toward mod-
ifying and adopting the european de-
signs to meet conditions in this country

  in  the baldwin locomotive
works brought out a four-cylinder bal-
anced compound locomotive built after
the designs of s m vauclain the first
engine of this type was a ten-wheel loco-
motive built for the plant system

in the baldwin balanced compound



engine the four cylinders are placed side
by side usually with their centers in the
same horizontal plane the two low-pres-
sure cylinders being outside the frames
and the two high-pressure cylinders in-
side

  the cylinders are cast in two parts
with  half-saddle  as usual each part
containing a high and low pressure cylin-
der with their valve-chest above and be-
tween them

  steam distribution to the two cylinders
on each side is controlled by a single
piston-valve operated by a single valve-
gear in the earlier engines of this type
the stephenson link motion was employed
but many of the subsequent designs have
been equipped with the walschaert valve-
gear

in opposing motion

  the main rods of the high-pressure
cylinders connect to one of the axles
which is cranked for that purpose while
the two low-pressure cylinders are con-
nected to crank-pins on the driving-
wheels in the usual manner

  the cranks of the driving axles on the
same side of the locomotive are  de-
grees apart in other words when one
of the pistons is -at the front end of its
cylinder the other piston on that side is
at the back end of its cylinder and the
horizontal or reciprocating parts are thus
in opposing motion and consequently
balance each other without the need of
excess balance in the wheels

  in the ten-wheeled or atlantic type
engines the inside main rods are usually-
connected to the leading axle while the
outside main rods are connected to either
the front or second pair of driving
wheels as may be preferred

  in cases where the leading driving
axle is so close to the cylinders that it
is impossible to connect the higli-press-
ure cylinders to it without making the
main rod too short as in the pacific and
prairie types they are connected to the
second driving axle

  in such cases either the inside cylin-
ders are inclined at such an angle that
the main rods will clear the front axle
or else the main rods are constructed
with a loop of bifurcation which em-
braces the leading axle


the railroad mans magazine

  two years after the appearance of the
baldwin balanced compound engine the
american locomotive company intro-
duced a compoimd engine in iwhich the
balanced principle was employed built
after the designs prepared by f j cole
consulting engineer of the company

  in this type of compound the low-
pressure cylinders are outside the frames
and the high-pressure cylinders are in-
side but located ahead of the low-press-
ure cylinders following the arrangement
employed in the famous de glehn bal-
anced compound locomotive which had
been so successful abroad

in one casting

  separate valves are used for the high
and low pressure cylinders on the same
side of the engine but these are mounted
on a single valve stem operated by a sin-
gle valve motion

  both high - pressure cylinders with
their respective valve-chambers are in
one casting while the low-pressure
cylinders with their valve-chambers are
cast in pairs with  half-saddles in the
manner usual in single expansion en-
gines the valve-chambers of the high-
pressure cylinders are in exact line with
those of the low-pressure cylinders the
two being connected together so as to
form a continuous valve chamber

  this arrangement of cylinders permits
of balancing the reciprocating parts and
also of dividing the application of
power between two driving axles with
the least change from the usual construc-
tion of single expansion engines

  by placing the high-pressure cylin-
ders ahead of the low pressure the in-
side main rods can be connected to the
leading axle in all the present types of
passenger-engines and a good length of
min rod secured without increasing the
length -of the wheel-base

  this alo involves a corresponding in-
crease in the length of the boiler and
flues which latter course must be fol-
lowed to obtain the same results where
the four cylinders are placed abreast as
in the case of the baldwin balanced
compound

  although it cannot be said that the
four-cylinder balanced compound has
been generally adopted it offers impor-

tant advantages and it would seem that
the further development of the passen-
ger-engine will probably be along the
line of the four-cylinder engines-either
the balanced compound the balanced
simple or the articulated compound type

  in this connection it is interesting to
note that the american locomotive
company has recently built two atlantic
type passenger-engines for the chicago
rock island and pacific railroad hav-
ing four simple cylinders arranged on
the balanced principle and using super-
heated steam

  simplicity of construction has always
been the keynote of american locomo-
tive practise the complications in de-
sign resulting from the application of
the compound principle to locomotives
is one of the main reasons why the com-
pound locomotive has not met with the
success in this country that it has abroad

  american railroad officials however
are alive to the necessity of unproved
economy and the effort to effect this and
avoid the disadvantage of the compound
principle has led to the introduction bf
another important principle in american
locomotive practise

superheated steam

  this principle is the application of
superheated steam to locomotives super-
heated steam is nothing more nor less
than very hot steam it is steam of a
higher temperature than that which it
attains in the boiler in being raised to
the boiler pressure by separating the
steam from the water from which it is
generated and passing it over very hot
surfaces additional heat can be added
to it this is what is done in a loco-
motive

  when steam enters a locomotive cyl-
inder it becomes cooled by coming into
contact with the cylinder walls and it
becomes further cooled by performing
work in the cylinder if the steam is
of ordinary temperature a large amount
of it is turned into water because of
this cooling process and passes through
the cylinder without doing any work and
is therefore wasted

 every engineer knows that besides
doing no work this water in the cylin-
ders is dangerous and if not released
progress in locomotive building



causes broken cylinder-heads bent pis-
ton-rods etc the use of superheated
steam offers the means of preventing
the steam being turned into water or
what is commonly known as cylinder
condensation since all the heat that is
added to the steam may be given up
before it is cooled down to the point
of where it becomes water

  by adding sufficient heat to the steam
therefore all the loss of power which
otherwise occurs can be prevented and
a great saving in coal and water effected

  superheated steam has another im-
portant advantage inasmuch as its tem-
perature is increased its volume is also
increased so that it will take a less
weight of steam to fill the cylinders if
the steam is superheated than if it is
at an ordinary temperature a further
saving in coal and water to do a given
amount of work is thus effected

  although the advantages to be de-
rived from tlie use of superheated steam
were fully appreciated by locomotive de-
signers and although numerous attempts
to apply it to locomotives were made in
the early days of locomotive building
it is only comparatively recently that
this principle has been successfully in-
troduced into locomotive practise

recently introduced

  in s dr william schmidt of
germany invented a design of super-
heater which was applied to two en-
gines on the prussian state railway

  in  the american locomotive
company brought out a superheater aft-
er the designs prepared by f j cole
who was also responsible for tlie four-
cylinder balanced compound built by
that company

  this design was applied to several en-
gines and considerable saving in fuel
and water effected since that time over
 locomotives equipped with super-
heaters have been built by that company
all of the superheaters applied by the
american locomotive company have
been of the fire-tube type that is a num-
ber of ordinary boiler tubes are replaced
by larger tubes in which are placed the
superheater pipes through which the
steam has to pass on its way from the
throttle to the cylinders

  with this arrangement the hot gases
direct from the fire are utilized to super-
heat the steam and high temperatures
are obtained by which only can be se-
cured tlie greatest advantages that are to
be derived from superheated steam

improved superheaters

  in the latest form of the american
locomotive companys superheater
each of the large tubes contains four
superheater pipes which as they emerge
from the tube are bent around horizon-
tally to meet the header or steam boxes
which are located in either side of the
smoke-box these headers are divided in-
to two compartments and steam from the
throttle enters one compartment and
passes into the superheater pipes

  it flows over the hot surfaces of these
pipes from which it receives additional
heat and is carried back again to the
other compartment of the header from
whence it enters the cylinders

  two forms of this design are in use
one gives a very high degree of tempera-
ture and the other a moderate degree

  superheated steam has been used on
the canadian pacific railway to a much
greater extent than on any other ameri-
can road the present standard super-
heater on this road is also of the fire-
tube type of the design known as the
vaughan-horsey type after the names of
its inventors h h vaughan assistant
to the vice-president and a w horsey
district master mechanic of the cana-
dian pacific railway

  following the introduction of the
cole superheater the baldwin loco-
motive works brought out a design of
superheater of the smoke-box type in
which the waste gases in the smoke-box
are utilized to superheat the steam as
the temperature of the gases in the
smoke-box are not sufficiently high to
givevery much superheat comparatively
little economy is effected by this type of
superheater and the most approved
practise here and abroad is to use the
fire-tube type of superheater-

  the application of superheated steam
to locomotives is fast growing in favor
in this country and promises to be one
of the most important developments in
present-day locomotive practise

chapter xxiii
how the high priest died

fhe came over to me took me in
her arms and kissed my lips

 save uncle dick  whis-
pered  you may escape in

 there is no way she said
 be a brave boy roland and
go back to the united states and tell your
story perhaps some one will listen to
you and you can have these people pun-
ished you must live for you have your
whole life before you

   and what will my life be when i
know it was gained at the cost of my
uncles life   i asked

   you must be brave she said again
 show that you are a little man

  then she kissed me again looked long
at uncle dick took the captains hand
then turned and walked back toward the
guard and away from the altar

  as she left us we heard chanting and
turned to find that the doomed priests
were entering the clearing under guard
they came forward quickly and stopped
just outside the circle of shells

  what is the meaning of this the
high priest demanded

  it means said welch that the
people will not stand by and see the great
aitu desecrated again it means you
lacked the courage to attend to the duties
of your office

    acted in wisdom and fairness the
high priest said  i call upon you now
to stand aside and allow me to address
the people

  the people do not care to hear you
  the law says a condemned man may
 have his say the high priest said in a
 loud voice  dare you deny me the
 rights of the aitus law 

   in the face of the announcement welch
 could not refuse the high priest walked
 within the circle of shells and spoke

    when you entered the aitus temple
last night and desecrated it by your mad-
ness  and my priests were at council

    you took me and my brethren from
the temple and called us condemned we
were not condemned before the sacred
aitu and therefore an execution on this
sacred altar will be a profanation we
have served you long and faithfully and
this is the way you forget shame my
 children where is your reasoning

    enough  welch cried afraid the
sentiment of the mob would change

      will go on the high priest declared
  i am here to save the aitu from further
 profanation my people in searching the
 law we found that in a case such as this
 there is a way the aitu may be purified

    the law says that at any time there is
 the slightest doubt of the aitus sanctity
 it may be made pure by the execution of
 a priest upon the sacred altar the law
 further states that all the brethren as-
 sembled in council may select by silent
 lot the priest so to die if it is your wish
 that the aitu be preserved sacred we will
 return to the temple and go through the
 ceremony in the presence of the aitu

    after the execution of the priest these
 prisoners may be rightfully condemned
 and executed without incurring the aitus
 displeasure and our temple will be sacred
 again and our land safe from distress

-the daughter of the idol



   no no-it is not the law  welch
cried

    it is the law the high priest said

  it is peculiar how the sentiment of a
mob will change in the twinkling of an
eye here was their high priest a man
they had respected for years standing
clothed in the dignity of his office speak-
ing with the voice of wisdom the re-
action was at hand

   let us preserve the sanctity of the
aitu   they cried  to the temple  to
the temple  let the priests ballot what
differs it these men must die 

  in vain welch tried to stpp them he
knew how the balloting would result
they surged forward to kiss the garments
of the priests the procession was formed
again and we made our way back along
the forest path up the broad avenue and
to the temple we were taken to the room
of worship and placed under guard

   then in the silence of death the high
priest prepared the ballots one by one
the priests stepped forward and selected
one and marked it welch did not dare
speak for the law said a word meant
death during the ceremony

  when all the ballots were marked the
high priest placed them on a golden plate
and put the plate at the aitus feet then
the chantbegan and candles were burned
in the presence of them all the high priest
counted the ballots and put them back at
the feet of the idol then he walked
across to welch

    the aitu claims your life brother
he said  through your death it will
become purified

  it is a trick welch cried to the
people  they are killing me because i
took your side last night dont you see
it is a trick i returned the aitu to you
from a foreign land i have done many
things for you

   the high priest silenced him

    my children he said to the people
 the brother looks at the matter in the
wrong light he is not condemned be-
cause of a fault he lias been chosen to
have the greatest honor possible to one jn
the priesthood what greater honor could
there be for any of us my children than
to give up our lives that the aitu may be
blessed

    its a trick   welch cried again

    it is an honor  true son of the aitu

would refuse unless he be a coward   the
high priest replied

  ill show you i am no coward
welch screamed

  his hand came from beneath his robe
holding a revolver the weapon spoke
the smoke drifted to one side and the
high priest lay upon the floor blood flow-
ing from a wound in his breast and
welch waving the revolver in his hand
dashed for a side door

  then bedlam broke loose again the
other priests ran to their fallen chief

   he is dead-dead   they moaned

  the high priest is dead-is dead
the people screamed

  they rushed for the door through which
welch had disappeared like angry beasts
they went through in pursuit

   he killed a man in the presence of
the aitu  they screeched  the aitu is
defiled again until he dies 

  in time all of them were gone the
guards had forgotten us in the face of
this great tragedy only the priests re-
mained surrounding the body of the one
who had been the head of the temple
and as we watched they lifted the body
and bore it into another rsom

   now is our chance  captain haw-
son cried

   we cannot leave the temple said
rutli  for they will see us as soon as
they have dealt with welch they will
remember us

   then we can hide within the temple
the captain said

  he ran toward one of the doors and
we followed through a great corridor
we hurried in the darkness and into an-
other room and from that to another
apartment in another part of the temple

  there was a window in the room and
we looked out the mob surged about
the square they had taken welch easily
and were carrying him down the avenue

   not to the execution ground some
of them were crying ive cannot slay
him there for we are not priests

   then get the priests others an-
swered

  while some held welch under guard
others ran back toward the temple in
a short time they emerged again two of
the priests with them and then the
crowd hurried on down the broad avenue
on the way to the execution-ground


the railroad mans magazine

  il it is not safe to remain here the
captain said  they will search the tem-
ple and find us

  we left the apartment and went tljrough
another dark corridor making our way
to the first floor of the temple and emerg-
ing in the worship-room behind the aitu

  adjoining the main worship-room was
a smaller apartment used by the priests
it had but the one entrance and only one
window which was high up in he wall
we hurried into this room

  there were weapons there and we
seized them gladly and saw that they were
properly loaded then the captain and
uncle dick carried heavy furniture across
the room and piled it against the door
then we waited for their coming

      chapter xxiv
      how it all ended

xjalf an hour passed and we heard
the mob approaching the temple
chanting and screeching

   it will soon be over now the cap-
tain said	-

  i sat in the corner saying nothing it
was not a pleasant predicament to say
the least and the future looked dark
uncle dick and ruth holland were
standing near me in each others arms

  we heard the mob start to enter the
temple heard the frantic people rush
from room to room below searching for
us crying to the priests and demanding
what had become of us

  there was a great crowd outside in the
square waiting for us to be captured and
taken out their cries were fearful

  suddenly as we listened we heard the
tone of their cries change from anger to
surprise heard loud shouts and com-
mands and the sound of firing

   they must be fighting among them-
selves   uncle dick said

   pray heaven such is the case the
captain answered  that will give us
another respite

   listen  i cried suddenly so loud
that the men in the temple must have
heard me

  for i had heard something other than
the howling of the mob the others
heard it too

  it was the shrill note of a bugle

   the cruiser is here  the captain
cried

  thank heaven ruth exclaimed

  then the firing in the square became
a regular battle the bugles rang out
loud and clear and mingled with the
howls of rage and fear from the fanatics
were the cheering cries of the marines
and bluejackets as they fought their way
toward the temple

  here roland the captain cried
from beneath the window

  he helped me to his shoulders- and i
stood up and peereclout into the square
in regular formation the men from the
cruiser were advancing on the temple
driving the fanatics before them the
air was filled with smoke which half ob-
scured the scene of battle the fanatics
were not cowards-they fought bravely
enough-but no body of untrained men
no matter how large could stand up
before the splendid discipline of uncle
sams navy

  foot by foot the fanatics gave way
then they broke and fled from side to side
throwing away their weapons screeching
at the top of their voices as they rushed
for safety to the jungle and the men
from the cruiser rushed for the temple
doors

  if they are only in time uncle
dick said  these men will kill us now
as soon as we are found

  i got down from the captains shoul-
ders and we crossed the room to the
door the crowd was in the main wor-
ship-room now looking into all the rooms
that opened into it the din was deaf-
ening we could not understand what
was said

  then the assault upon our door came
we placed ruth in a corner and the
three of us stood in a line each with a
weapon handy ready to sell our lives as
dearly as possible and reach the sailors
alive if we could

  the battering at the door continued
the cries grew louder the battle raged
suddenly in the temple-room for the sail-
ors and marines had reached there

   i wish we were out there uncle
dick cried

  it is safer in here at present the
captain said

  volleys of shots sounded in the temple-
room we could hear the sailors cheer-
the daughter of the idol



ing could hear the fanatics giving their
peculiar battle-cry

  which side was conquering we did not
know the fanatics could not stand be-
fore the marines in the open but in the
temple in the presence of the great aitu
it might be a different thing

  again the cries of the fanatics changed
in tone and now became cries of fear
there were cries of fear in english too

  what can it be ruth cried

  the captain had gone nearer the door
and was trying to hear

  they are crying fire he said
 some one must have set fire to the tem-
ple it will burn like tinder 

  outside in the large room there seemed
to be a stampede but the battering at
the door continued and in time it was
forced open a little

   stand ready  the captain cried
 give it to them we must fight our
way through dont forget miss hol-
land when the time comes 

  the battle in the temple-room still
raged now we could hear the crackling
of the flames the door was forced open
a foot and the thick black smoke poured
in upon us

  to the floor the captain cried
 crawl toward the door  

  we threw ourselves on the floor the
smoke filled the room and poured
through the one window into the open
air we could see flames in the temple-
room could see the figures of men dash-
ing through the smoke they were com-
ing nearer

   this way  get them out  some
one cried in english

  he was answered by screams from the
fanatics half a dozen men showed in
the smoke just outside the door in a
moment they were sprawling over the
furniture we had piled there

  in another moment the furniture had
been hurled to one side and some one
sprang in upon us i raised my revolver
captain hawson threw my arm upward
as i fired and the bullet went wild

   it is one of uncle sams men  he
cried

   where are you came the cry

   here 

  out all of you be quick the
roof will fall in a few minutes 

  we sprang to our feet and with ruth

    	r r

in the midst of us staggered to the door
the smoke was not so thick that the ma-
rines could not cheer when they saw us
and then we began our battle to reach
the temple entrance

  there were fanatics still in the room
firing wildly at the sailors and at each
other in the smoke before we realized
it we were hemmed in by marines and a
midshipman was issuing orders in a loud
voice we made our way slowly across
the room

  i felt my head swimming felt my
lungs growing sore the flames were all
about us once i turned to find that
captain hawson and uncle dick were
carrying ruth between them

   on - on   the midshipman was
shouting  we are almost there 

  another moment and we had reached
the entrance we staggered down the
steps into the midst of the sailors and
marines who had remained in the open
as we reached the monument in the
center of the square there was a great
crash behind us a cloud of smoke and
flame shot into the air and the roof and
walls of the temple fell burying the
great aitu in its sepulcher of ruins

  the fanatics who remained unscathed
fled in terror into the jungle

  it was the work of only a few minutes
to bring ruth back to consciousness and
then we received the captain of the
cruiser who had come ashore when the
heavy firing began captain hawson
told his story as quickly as possible

    have sent men to see about this
man welch said the commander

  as he spoke his men returned and a
midshipman stepped forward to make his
report then his superior turned to us
again

   welch has found a grave in the land
he tried to despoil he said

  then we marched down the broad ave-
nue to the shore the cruiser lay at an-
chor a short distance out white and buff
shining brightly in the sunshine old
glory was fluttering in the breeze at the
stern

  half an hour later we were on the
deck of the cruiser

  what shall i do about your ship
captain hawson was asked

  he faced  the cruisers commander
bravely


the railroad mans magazine

  send a shell into her he said
 if i returned to another port i would
have explanations to make and from
this time on i lead an honest life and i
cannot do it on a dishonest ship

  the two captains clasped hands

   it shall be as you wish said the
cruisers commander

  we stood on the bridge while one of
the great guns forward barked and
watched as the shell struck there was
a roar a crash and the faraway sank

  then the cruiser sailed from the tiny
harbor and started back across the pa-
cific the commander had promised to
land us at honolulu

   when i make my report he said
 i shall treat captain hawson with
charity inasmuch as both mr engle and
miss holland do not wish to prosecute
him for his part in their abduction he
has won their regard by his bravery
but this boy roland burke must have
a grievance against the captain too of
cdurse if mr burke wants him prose-
cuted-

  i felt my chest expand when he called
me mister and ruths silvery laugh rang
out for answer i stepped forward and
took captain hawson by the hand

    i guess that settles it said the com-
mander

  it was evening and i was standing on
the bridge when ruth and uncle dick
came to me hand in hand

   we are going to be married ro-
land ruth said  we wanted to tell
you first of all

   i had almost guessed it i replied
with wisdom beyond my years  but
there is one thing id like to know what
was it that made uncle dick dislike you
so when first he met you  

  her face clouded for a moment but
when uncle dick put his arms around
her the smiles came to her lips again

   he thought she replied  that i
was in league with welch

   i do not understand i said

   he thought-or rather was made to
believe - that i had conspired with
welch to steal the aitu and that it was
taken aboard the cruiser instead of the
yacht by mistake your uncle respects
all religions and has no love for one
who would despoil a temple

the

   then he was made to believe that
i was really going to marry welch that
i had been playing with his heart we
met in california at a resort a few days
before i was abducted

   that was when i left you alone in
san francisco for two days roland my
uncle explained

   we had a quarrel there she went
on  your uncle wanted me to marry
him and i refused because i knew the
fanatics would seek us and try to carry
us back to death he thought i refused
because of welch he went away angry
i was angry too

   when lie saw me aboard the fara-
way he thought i had told the fanatics
where to find him  that i had betrayed
him to his death  that i was seeking re-
venge and trying to help welch at the
same time but it is all clear now

    i think you were both very foolish
i exclaimed  i thought all the time it
was something really important

   roland roland  cried ruth
laughing in spite of herself  it was
important-very important-to your un-
cle and to me

  uncle dick kissed her fondly the
executive officer of the cruiser who was
on the bridge looked the other way

   on the bridge  hailed captain
hawson from below

   well sir asked the executive offi-
cer

   kindly tell that pair of lovers up
there that they both need rest and that
their cabins are prepared for them
therell be plenty of time for spooning
after they reach honolulu

    aye aye sir  laughed the executive
officer

   and tell that boy roland to come
down here to me immediately i want
to talk to him hes got fighting-blood
in his veins  

  then we all laughed and i went down
and up to where the captain was sitting
there we sat and talked until my eyes
would stay open no longer captain haw-
son put one of his strong arms around
me i felt myself lifted tenderly and
carried toward the cabin

   its been a terrible experience i
heard him mutter  but it has made a
man of him
end
but there was nothin doin

     thus bill markleyspoke
to me as we sat on a truck
at the kourtland depot
one june evening as one
of the oldest engines of the road wheezed
and spluttered by to pick up a train

   yep i replied

be christened that name

    series began la the october  railroad mans maeailne single copies jo eents




the railroad mans magazine

then and the company operatin the same
was broke amost the line was earnin
good money all right but it was too heavy
in debt

the only engine

   they only had one engine with no
name or number ter do the freight and
passenger busness of the whole nineteen
miles of road i was fir in then and our
run was from the east end of the road at
cinnatus to the west end here nineteen
miles and two round trips every day

    the company had put up a big water -
tank at cinnatus and then found out they
was too poor ter buy power enough ter
pump her full of water they finly fixed
it with the milk-station people next to it
to fill the tank from their wells by their
big pumps

    our leavin time fer the first trip out
of cinnatus was  am about seven-
forty-five one june morning jim daley
my engineer backed the nameless power-
plant to the tank and i filled the tender
to the brim

   everything was workin right that
mornin until we got ter pullin up the
grade at whytes mills when i discovered
the steam was failin off my fire was
burnin great but i couldnt  ways seem
ter make that steam-indicator show right

   i turned on the blower and there
wasnt hardly enough power left ter blow
the fire

   well we struggled along until we
got bout to east freeville when i heard
jim yell and seen him jam on the air and
then jump

   we werent runnin fast enough ter
do any particular damage by leavin the
track and we sure did jump regular those
clays with that poor-ballasted road i
stepped to the side of the engine and
looked fer jim but all i seen was his back
and that was fast fadin inter the per-
spective

   i stood there wonderin what had
hit jim when al kemp our conductor

comes runnin up and wants ter know
whats wrong says i  jims gone crazy
jumped and run there aint nothin
the matter only we cant seem ter keep
up steam enough ter git anywheres

    i hadnt no moren got the words out
of my mouth afore i heard   jump bill-
jump  shes goin to blow up  

    then fer the first time i seemed to
hear a sizzlin an foamin goin on inside
that engine which didnt sound right and
there was a white fluid just boilin out all
over her it didnt take me long ter go
after jim then you bet and the whole
crew followed suit we got over behind a
hill and waited fer the explosion but
there was nothin doin

   after about an hour we screwed up
gumption enough to go back evry-
thing was quiet and no-trouble seemed
to exist about the engine cept she was
coated over with some white stuff and
the sizzlin had expired

just a mistake

   we sat round fer a spell tryin ter
make out the cause but nobody seemed
ter have any explanation finly jim
got up on the tender and lifted the tank
cover he stood lookin in a minute and
then motions me up i took one look
and shut the cover down remarkin ter
jim it wont do nobody no good ter
say anything about that

    it wasnt until after the engine had
been ter the shops that any of the crew
learned what the real trouble was but
they did joke us some after that about
her stomach being full of dutch cheese
bill sat back and puffed a while in si-
lence i gazed at him wondering how
the cheese got into the boiler he evi-
dently reading my thought continued

   yep twas dutch cheese and one on
me you see the milk-station people had
pumped our water-tank full of sour milk
by mistake and i had filled the tender
without noticing the mistake

     he and monk hastily desert their auto when they
     get a jack binns from geraldine and her mollycoddle

te having nothing else
on hand engineered an-
other meeting between
monk and the individual
with the watery eyes aft-
er an interchange of cour-
tesies the individual with the watery
weeps inquired  have you had any
more of those remarkable adventures since
i saw you last 

   have i   queried monk  why
ive had the time of my life ive been
hobnobbing with the harriman of the
highways doing stunts in an automo-
bile with the only and original auto hobo
of america

   if you can relieve yourself without
crossing the rubicon of truth i believe i
can pose as a willing listener without re-
sorting to anesthetics commented the
watery-eyed one	

   the last time we met retorted
monk  you cast aspersions on my verac-
ity by inquiring whether ananias did not
grace the upper branches of my genealogy
ical tree

   i did replied the watery-eyed one
 but with all due respect to annernias
 in that case replied monk  i will
overlook your seeming irrelevancy and
give you a leaf from the log of my ad-
ventures with this motor marauder one
afternoon i was doing the at-home stunt
neath the shade of the old apple-tree
when a stranger hove in sight wiped his
feet on the  welcome  mat and proceed-
ed to ingratiate himself i entertained
him with a recital of one of my adven-
tures after which he announced his de-
sire for sleep

   very natural interrupted the weepy
one

  ignoring the remark monk continued

                         

 he requested me to awaken him should
an auto bearing his crest put in appear-
ance and was soon pounding his auricular
appendage on the herbaceous hummock
while i listened to the sighing of the
wind in the branches and mused on the
mutability of things in general lazily
i watched the passing autos and envied
the favored sons of the ennui class who
are handicapped by the burden of wealth
and the responsibilities of rank theres
nobody to flash a red at them and chase
them along a siding until the perishable
produce goes by

   theres nobody to worry them except
the bucolic burgomaster who penalizes
them seven-fifty for flirting with the un-
dertaker on the only decent mile of- road
within the burg

  as i lolled and dreamed a machine
came along traveling slowly as it drew
near i noted that it contained but a single
occupant evidently the chauffeur who
appeared to be on the lookout for some
one i arose and sauntered leisurely for-
ward

   the only occupant asked me whether
i had seen an individual meandering
around who looked like an imitation of
richard mansfield

   i asked him for specifications as to
the character in the great actors repertory
the meandering mansfield assumed he
replied that he was not long on histrionic
characterization but he thought it was
markhams  the man with the nose

   i associated his meager description
with the personality of my guest and
informed the proud pleasure  pilot that
the great cyrano was doing the by-by act
neath the pippin-tree he asked me to
awaken the rostrand replica and inform
him that his auto had arrived


the railroad mans magazine

     say sport i answered  desist your
dippy discourse whoever heard of a
weary wayfarer along handout highway
possessing an automobile 

   the chipper chauffeur did not deign
to reply but strode over to the slumberer
and shook him de bergerac awoke and
cast his optics over the moving-picture
show then he indulged in a conversa-
zione with the haughty-autoist who final-
ly handed him some bills and took his de-
parture

   i watched him hoofing it down the
pike and wondered what i was up against
then i approached the guest of honor
and by judicious questioning i elicited
the information that the auto belonged to
him

   say pard ive heard of pan-han-
dlers pushing toward the stygian dark-
ness on proud plugs but that was the first
time id been up against the auto-hobo
combination just imagine an intelligent
itinerant mastering the mysteries of me-
chanics or getting up energy sufficient to
turn the hurdy-gurdy crank of an auto
so as to get a tune out of the engine

   i expressed my doubts as to his abil-
ity to run the auto but he assured me that
he was an expert said he was a meander-
ing mechanic-an md of the autopathic
school-and made real money doctoring
the afflicted autos of the rich then he
asked me to take a ride and when i put
up the bluff that like the ballet-dancer
id nothing to wear he dug down into
the hamper and produced a couple of auto
rigs which we put on then he started
the engine and we climbed in say sport
did you ever take your affinity to one of-
those gladsome groves where every one
indulges in the abandon of amusement 
questioned monk

   do i look like one who would lure
a lady to a luny park resented the
watery-eyed one

   well theres no use negotiating the
altitudes retorted monk  i meant
nothing impersonal if youve never been
to any of the hilarious haunts you do not
know the fascination of shooting the
chutes or gliding over the undulating sur-
face of the scenic railway like a streak
of greased cosmoline if youve never
leaped along the level ways or climbed
the incline like a ricket-if youve never
shot down the declivities like an alpine

 avalanche bent on a mission of oblitera-
 tion-you cannot appreciate the sensation
 i experienced on my first automobile ride

--  i abandoned myself to the novelty of
 the situation and thought of the many
 times i had traveled in a more primitive
 way brake-beams and empty freights
 are all right but the auto is the aristocrat
 of conveyances

    de bergerac certainly knew how to
 handle that car and he kept her going
 until near dusk we put up for the night
 at a farmhouse where it happened that
 the host was an enthusiastic autoist and
 de bergerac so won him over by letting
 him talk about his machine that he forgot
 to make any charge for our entertain-
 ment

     we made an early start after an ap-
 petizing breakfast and de bergerac said
 we would take a run up to lake nocopo
 a swell summer resort i saw more scen-
 ery on that trip than you could see in a
 week traveling in the old-fashioned way
 we finally reached the lake and had our
 first view of the classy resort from the
 lower end around the hotel which we
 could barely discern in the distance there
 did not seem to be much evidence of life
 the guests evidently being at breakfast

    de bergerac brought his machine to
 a stop that we might enjoy the witchery
 of the scene coming across the water
 toward us was a canoe containing a
 young man and a young woman the
 feminine end of the combination was fur-
 nishing the motive power while the chol-
 ly-boy seemed to be content with looking
 picturesque and puny

    on they came gliding over the wa-
 ter when suddenly that mollycoddle mas-
 culine made a fool move and upset the
 birch bateau the girl came up first
 and grabbing the struggling shrimp by
 the back of the neck she swam with him
 to the overturned craft

    the physical-culture girl seemed to
 be handicapped by the swimless swain
 and made no effort to right the canoe

    de bergerac realizing her predica-
 ment remarked that it was evidently up
 to us to do the heroic-rescue act

    how do you propose to capture the
 carnegie compensation   i inquired

    de bergerac thought for a moment
 then he jumped from the car and got busy
 detaching the tire from one of the wheels
de bergerac

of the boes



     say i protested  those capsized ca-
noists are doing a jack binns dont
you think youd better let your repairs
wait until we have rescued them

     thats all right he answered as he
sprung the tire from the wheel  here
get busy and pump this up tight

   i got onto the job wondering wheth-
er the harrowing scene had affected his
mentality as  finished he sprung an-
other tire from its wheel and proceeded
to inflate it thoroughly then he picked
up the tire and made for the lake bid-
ding me to do likewise when he reached
the water he jumped in and i realized
then that we were rushing to the rescue
with improvised life-preservers

   i followed de bergerac into the chil-
ly water im no woolly water-spaniel
and i dont fancy scorching over the
water on a personally conducted auto-
mobile tire after about ten minutes
hard work we reached the distressed
damsel and her companion and de ber
gerac instructed them as to the method
of putting a life-preserver on straight

   when the pocket-edition of mascu-
linity had gotten himself comfortably en-
sconced in his life-preserver he fumbled
in his coat-pocket and pulled out his card-
case with difficulty he opened it and
took out a damp card he handed it to
de bergerac saying

    i feel that the conventionalities
should be observed before we proceed fur-
ther permit me to introduce myself

   de bergerac glanced at the card and
said

    mr de trop i am pleased to meet
you unfortunately i have left my card-
case in my auto i am known as c
de bergerac this is m hausen

  the drawing-room hero acknowledged
the introduction with a porpoiselike bow
muttering  chawmed

    miss geraldine he said turning to
the girl  allow me to present messieurs
de bergerac and hausen gentlemen
miss geraldine pendelton

   say sport commented monk  ive
been up against social etiquette in all
quarters of the earth but blow me if that
wasnt the first time id participated in a
deep-sea drawing-room function

   after the formalities had been ob-
served de bergerac approached the fair
maiden and said

    miss pendelton may i have the
honor of saving your life 

   fair geraldine smiled her assent and
de bergerac righted the canoe then
while i steadied it he assisted her to re-
embark then he climbed in and asked
me to pass him the paddle which was
floating a short distance away i secured
it for him and he directed me to lash the
two life-preservers together i did so
and he made them fast to the canoe

    i say de bergerac remarked the
de trop party going to leave me here
  as there does not seem to be any
chloroform in the pursers cabin replied
de bergerac  i think we had better pro-
ceed as we are

   de trop attempted to remonstrate
but de bergerac swung the paddle and
we started on our triumphal journey to
safety the girl looked happy but humid
de bergerac looked heroic and hopeful
while your humble servant and the too-
much individual looked like a couple of
inanimate automatons stuck in crullers

   we proceeded shoreward guided by
the skilful strokes of the versatile volun-
teer and eventually landed de berge-
rac quickly replaced the tires and bun-
dling the rescued resorters into the auto
drove swiftly to the hotel

   when the guests heard of the heroic
rescue they lionized that carnegie hero
 i suppose ventured the individual
with the watery eyes  that your friend
with the histrionic handle married the
water-nymph and lived happy ever aft-
erward 

   no replied monk  fiction may
flourish but truth will prevail as a
chronicler of facts i have no other re-j
course than to announce the union of the
house of pendelton with that of de trop
though what she could see in that scion
of immobility surpasses understanding

   what became of the chauffeur with
the courtly name asked the individual
with the lacrimose lamps

  the auto hobo is no more replied
monk  he has forsaken the open road
for the closed shop of servility he is now
chauffeur - in - chief to the house of de
trop i was offered the position of but-
ler in the same institution but as i know
nothing about butling i declined if you
can spare me a match ill light up and
say good-by merci bocoo

i

ive traveled all over this blessed land-know every burg on the map

and you can take it from me straightdope it isnt much of a snap

its the lonesomest life in all the world forever and ever to roam
especially so for a girl like me whos crazy to have a home

say thats phony dope about millionaires hanging around the stage

those guys aint lookin for song-birds to put in a legal cage

they want the girl with the champagne taste-the one who can kick so
     high-

but the decent girl with the shabby dress why she gets the icy eye

thats a great old joke about virtue being its own reward-

and whenever a well-meaning dub says that i laugh and swallow hard
sounds funny when ive starved and froze because i was on the square-
so me for a large-sized healthy hunch that the world aint playing fair

may be only a chorus girl but i know a thing or two

if youve got a moment to while away ill put you wise to a few
seems strange for me to be resting here with never a thought of
care

         when i ought to be with  the moonlight maids swingin my
             feet in the air


                one morning out in lonesome tank while waiting for a train

                we were tired and cold and hungry drenched with a driving rain

               when it came at last-two hours late-and i ran out to see-

                a kindly face in the engine-cab looked down and smiled at me

                 the cars were full but i found a seat and managed to sleep a while

                and into my dream came the kindly face and the sympathetic smile

               then all at once a crash-a pain-and scream that followed scream

               i tried to wake-i couldnt move-i thought i was in a dream

                 at length i came from that awful sleep in the arms of the engineer

                hed pulled me out of the wreck they said and then he sent me here

                he never asked any questions but one day as he stroked my hand-

                 i told him the whole of my miserable life for i knew hed understand

                 say you can have all the millionaires but ill take bill jerome

                 for while im lying dreaming here hes fixing up a home

                 its never again to pike around to starve and fear the cold-

                 for under his greasy working clothes there beats a heart of gold

                  itsnix on the guy that owns the road or the son of a millionaire

                 they hand out bottles of hells first aid and bunches of stale hot air
                 but the man who is used to the worlds hard knocks is the one to bless a home
                 and when i get well its a lead-pipe cinch ill bet on bill jerome

a trestle over a crack in arizona catches fire and  almost proves
that he is made of real hero stuff when
he rescues jimmy bailey

              y

every engineer and scoop-pusher in helper
service began to take notice of him and
help him along

   of course some of them took liberties
at times especially  smoke  kelley
 smoke  liked to have his little fun
every semioccasionally and almost put
in quite a bunch of time hunting left-
handed bell-ropes and on one occasion
put in half a day polishing the bell to
improve its tone

  but when  smoke  liked you he
showed it by every sort of a practical
joke and as lie was always showing the
boy little things about the engine he
added his share to the general educa-
tional donation

there were times when almost ap-

series began in march railroad mans magazine single copies jo cents



          aving nothing much to do
but wait for pay-day and
maintain the dignity neces-
sary to a  general fore-
man  at hulbrook i
found quite a chunk of
time in which i could drop grains of wis-
dom in almosts vicinity it was a reve-
lation how near human he was

  in less than a week after i made him
chief clerk he could dump a grate and
pull a fire as artistically as any tallow-
pot on the pike he even knew the in-
jector from the air - valve and got over
looking at the steam-gage to see what
time it was	

  in another month he knew every part
on that engine by its first name and
the evolution of almost



peared hopeless he insisted on letting
an empty coal-car down from the coal-
chute and as a result -he built a little
church out of a flat car which was stand-
ing in on the coal-chute track about fifty
yards away

  almost didnt stop at the same time the
gondola did he knocked two boards
off the sand fence which stood a good
twenty feet from the siding outside of
that he was all right and insisted that
he  almost had it stopped when it hit

  there was one great thing about al-
most when he started something he al-
ways hung around for the finish of
course it was up to the general foreman
and the chief clerk to make the needed
repairs on the gondola and the flat so
almost had a chance to take a lesson
or so in box-car physiology

  knowing as i did that digging clink-
ers from a grate polishing wheels and
banking fires with putting in a brass
now and then as an extra amusement
wasnt exactly conducive to intellectual
progress i was rather surprised that al-
most began to show signs of  book
larnin

caught with the goods

  he was mighty careful to hide the
traces but i caught him with the goods
one day under the engine in the pit
with the time-table spread out on his oily
knees and he was spelling out the names
of the stations along the pike he had
the letters down fairly well but what he
called some of those towns would have
made them pretty sore if they had heard
it

  it wasnt more than a month after
that that almost came into the box-car
office one afternoon about four oclock
and handed me the list of cars initials
car numbers and all the regular report i
had to send into the terminal office every
night i looked it over and you could
really read the thing

  of course  didnt want to embarrass
the boy so i just thanked him as if he
was in the habit of doing it every day
from that day on he did which left me
nothing to do but let my salary accu-
mulate and look out for almost

  finally maggie mahorney informed me
that almost was taking a daily newspaper
from albuquerque she said it in such

 a way that i knew without guessing twice
 where almost was attending night school

less title more money

   of course it was bound to come i
 couldnt stand die climate very long aft-
 er six months as general foreman i de-
 cided that i would take less title and
 more money

   about the only thing to break the si-
 lence at hulbrook was the sound of jed
 latroupes wooden leg pecking along the
 ties as he came to the station every
 morning to spring an old joke of his about
 it  bein awferl dry this year and the
 rumble of the trains as they passed by
 i wasnt cut out for the simple life any-
 how not for long at one time

   i wanted to get over into the train
 service as i had had a little taste of that
 in years past and liked it prejty well
 better than feeding coal to a double-
 doored hog or pulling a throttle at the
 head of a long string of empties or full
 tonnage of loads

   it looked as if the t m would never
 stop off at hulbrook and when he did
 come the little entertainment kept us

he had jimmy baileys body


the railroad mans magazine

so busy that i forgot about hitting him
for a job

  it was along in the afternoon when
every one in hulbrook took their  shut-
eye ail extra stock - train pulled up
at the station for orders against the pas-
senger - train and j k-we all called
the trainmaster j k when we didnt
call him something else-dropped off the
caboose and wandered up to the station

an air of industry

  jed latroupe was whittling  his
wooden leg and i saw the old man com-
ing so i got busy making out a bogus re-
port an air of industry around a station
carries a lot of weight with an official

  the stock-train pulled out and j k
remained to take up a few little matters
of business including an investigation of
the accident at the coal-chute when al-
most went coasting in the empty gondola
i told j k just how it was and he told
almost just how it was and assessed
fifteen brownies against his personal
record as fifteen brownies didnt de-
crease his pay a bit almost stood for
it and went back to his stall in jed
latroupes livery - stable to change his
clothes-for almost had two suits now
one suit of overalls and another of hand-
me-downs from albuquerque which he
insisted on wearing every sunday whether
we had company or not

the cry of  fire 

  about fifteen minutes later almost
came rushing into the box car puffing like
an engine on a heavy grade

   somethins on fire over yonder he
exclaimed

  and of course realizing that a fire in
a place where water dont grow is a
mighty serious thing j k and i did a
handicap free-for-all for the door it was
a dead heat and we jammed

  when we finally got out on the plat-
form a couple of miles down the track
and around a curve we could see a big
bank of grayish smoke rolling up it
looked as if it might be the bridge over
the little colorado but almost lowed
as how the only thing on the bridge that
could burn was the ties and that there
was too much smoke for that

  j k suggested that we advise the ter-
minal office and almost again lowed as
how about the only thing down that way
what would burn was that stock-train
which had pulled out about twenty min-
utes before

   then well order the wrecker from
winslow remarked the trainmaster and
began to write out a message using -the
side of the box-car station as a desk

  but almost had not been watching the
red ball freight and the varnished wag-
ons roll by day after day longing to be
out  top of the string swinging a high
ball or wishing that he was the man on
the rear platform with the blue uniform
and the brass buttons to let such an
opportunity as this pass by without ma-
king an effort to land

getting in line

  he couples into the trainmaster with
the suggestion that the wrecker would be
a long time getting over from winslow
and there was a pusher engine down on
the pit track an old derrick on the spur
and two full water-cars near the coal-
chute it would only be a matter of
switching them out and hitting the grit
to get over there

  if the fire was nothing to mention then
there was  harm done if it was a
wreck and a string burning up then
after all haste was the first demand

  j k fell for it almost put himself
in motion toward jed latroupes livery-
barn where the helper crew had just
turned in for a little shut-eye

  i five minutes they were down on the
engine which still had a fair head of
steam and then with me in the role of
engine boss with j k and almost work-
ing the field we switched out the cars
we wanted then we went it wild for
the cloud of smoke leaving word with
the station-agent to hold the board on
everything until we got back

at the scene

   smoke  kelley had the throttle on
that old teapot and according to al-
most  he shore did crack the whip with
them four cars

  the closer we got to the smoke the
surer we were that it wasnt a barbecue
the evolution of almost



or an old settlers picnic and when we
came around the aztec curve  smoke 
threw the big hole into them and even
then we only stopped a few inches
back of the dog-house

  of course the first move we
made was to see how many of the
crew was in sight  humpy 
jamison with one side of his face
hanging in ribbons came running
back toward us as we hastened
ahead it wasnt the lit-
tle colorado bridge that
had burned out but it
was a wooden trestle
over one of those cracks
in the ground which you
find all over arizona

  some of them you can
jump across but they
will be as much as fifty
feet deep this one was
about eighteen feet
across and forty deep

  jamison went the air
route and landed on his
face on the other side of
the canon his fireman
beat it to the brush be-
fore they went in and
was all to the good but
the head shack didnt
clear the wreckage and
was pinned under a car

  they had got him free of the wreck-
age and had him lying back  the desert
the rear brakeman was all to the good
except that when jamison threw the air
into them the brakeman tried to butt the
front end of the cupola away and really
did a good job of it too-laying his head
open for a few inches or more

  but they were all alive and kicking
except the captain of the ship jimmy
bailey he was missing the rear
shack said that the last he saw of him
he was coming over the string toward the
dog-house about midway of the train

  no i dont care for any more mutton
not since that day and every time i hear
the ba-ba it gives me a spell of chills
five cars of mutton went into that ditch
with the engine and they took fire three
more cars turned over and two others were
derailed and if a-human being can pro-
duce a more agonizing cry than some of
those sheep did-well just count me out

outside of that he was all right

  but then that has nothing to do with
the  report just about as fast as men
ever worked kelley drifted into the rear
of the string coupled onto the caboose
and we cut the string off behind the cars
that were derailed and pulled all those
that were  the track back about a mile

  in the meantime a terrier digging af-
ter a rat could not have been more busy
than almost he had grabbed an ax and
the way he was making holes in those
stock-cars and the way the sheep were
coming through those holes-well it was
really good to see except that the fire kept
coming back toward him and he kept
working closer to the fire

he was heat-proof

i suppose living in arizona most all
his life made him heat-proof for i know
i tried to get in and help him a little
and couldnt stand it if some one sue-


the railroad mans magazine

ceeds in convincing me that hades is just
half as hot as that place was im going
to be an awful good boy all my life

  heroism is all right in its place but i
never could see the virtue of risking your
one life er-for sheep say-so i began to
yell at almost to climb out of it j k
came running over and helped me cuss
the idiot

  then jamison came up and the rear
shack would have been there too if we
hadnt sent him over to see how the other
brakeman was making it out there under
the shade of a cactus almost didnt
even look up

  he was chopping away like a man gone
wild i was sure that he had suddenly
lost what little sense he had in fact i
was ready to admit right there that he had
had none to begin with

  his hat was gone his brick - colored
hair was singed you could see the blisters
raising on his face the fire was leaping
about him the inhuman screaming of the
sheep penned in the burning cars wreck-
age and blood every place and him stand-
ing there like a fool boy on the burning
deck eating peanuts

  then i started up after him but it
wasnt any use now i dont claim to be
the real hero but no one ever accused me
of having yellow stripes along my spine

almost is busy

  ive helped pick them up in baskets
and oft of boiler-heads ive faced the
big works a couple of times myself and
didnt let out a whimper but to see al-
most up there cutting kindling wood with
an ax while he was literally burning
alive well i guess there were a couple
of other fellows who said now i lay
me down to sleep and wasnt ashamed
of it either

  he seemed to be cutting a little hole
in between two cars which had telescoped
we finally couldnt see hihi more than
half the time for the smoke and the fire

  finally he stepped down into the hole
he had cut i saw him grab a brake-rod
and bend it back out of his way and the
thing was so hot you could see the smoke
from his burned hands when he took hold
of it

  once down in the hole to his waist
he shoved aside a board and bent over

a little and twice more he swung that
ax dropped it bent over and when he
straightened up his clothes burst into
flame and - so help me he had jim-
my baileys body in his arms

a fast ride



  he climbed out of that mess staggered
from one piece of wreckage to another
and fell his length in our direction

  jamison j k and myself reached
them in a jump jamison grabbed baileys
body and dragged it out to the side of the
track while j k and i beat the fire
which avas eating the boys clothes
baileys left arm told the story

  it had been pinned in the wreckage
so that it was held fast and the only way
that almost could get him free was to
cut it off those last two blows had done
the work

  conductor bailey still has one arm and
a mighty good body which he says he
owes to almost but just how completely
he owes it to almost no one knows any
better than i do

  ive ridden a few fast ones in my time
there was the time skinny farris took
me from torreon to jimulco there was
the time paxton rolled me down the big
divide when we expected the crown-sheet
to drop every minute but i never rode
quite as fast as  smoke  kelley pulled
us that evening in the dusk from the
wreck to the terminal and the nearest
surgeon

  that nig-ht bailey and almost occu-
pied neighboring cots in the hospital-
ward and it looked for a time as if neither
one of them was going to have much use
for ozone before long almost came out
of it first

in the hospital

  the trainmaster was there so was the
doctor and they let me hang around
seeing as how i got hostile when they
tried to put me out almost came to
his senses and raised a bandaged arm to
a more bandaged head and asked where
am i at

   youre in the hospital young man
and you want to keep real quiet for a time
well take those bandages off your eyes
the first thing in the morning
the evolution of almost



  then the details must have come back
to him he let out a sickening groan
the kind a fellow gives up when he lays
down to die and knows hes been a big
failure

   oh yes he says  i almost got
him

and jed once i told it four hundred and
eighty-seven times but before i started in
 them i hunted up maggie mahorney
and while we sat in her little dobe room
i told her the story and almost didnt
lose anything on account of me being his
john aldeneither

  i almost got him

v

   almost got him  chuckled j k in
the boys ear or right near where his
ear ought to be almost what-you
sure got him boy hes here in the hos-
pital with you

   thatll help a little replied al-
most and a few minutes later he drifted
off into a troubled sleep

whittled in two

  they both got well of course the
next day i had to hurry back to hul-
brook for tlie general foreman and the
chief clerk couldnt be away at the same
time and when i got back there i found
the town all but gone to the bad

  the posj-office had been closed ever
since the news became known jed la-
troupe had whittled  his wooden leg
until he whittled it plumb in two

if i told that story to the station-agent

  of course the story got out among the
boys you might hide a candle under a
basket but it wont cover a burning train
and when they got wise to the real dope
there was nothing to it but a medal for
almost

  i wondered what he would do witli a
medal in hulbrook where there was 
one to see it but the boys thought that
was the thing to do and as they didnt
consult me they went ahead and did it
they sent to albuquerque and had a sure
enough gold medal with a blue ribbon
on it and a nice epitaph inscribed

on a strike

  maybe it wasnt an epitaph but it was
something of that kind in the mean-
time i got hold of the-trainmaster told
him that every night i thought i heard
sheep howling down at hulbrook and my


the railroad mans magazine

nervous system wouldnt stand the strain
and suggested that i quit and that he use
his influence to get almost the job as
general foreman

  he said he would do it i quit and
they sent another man down there to fill
in until almost grew a new crop of skin

  well there was a tangle in the red
tape some place and before they got
around to making almost general fore-
man he went out on a strike when he
went back to work as chief clerk and
ex-officio guardian of uncle sams post-
office the boys sent a delegation down to
present the gold trimmins

  the very next day he came into the
terminal hunted me up and i was advised
of the wherefore and why of the strike
at hulbrook taking almosts own words
it was after this fashion

   now mr thomas i dont mind
cleanin ash-pans and diggin out clink-

ers fer your railroad an tryin ter earn
them forty-five pesos every month but
ill be durned if im-going ter trot around
that town a wealin a breastpin like this
and he produced the medal

  i talked it overwith almost and it
seems as if he really wanted a badge but
he wanted a stingers badge-he wanted
to be a real shack he wanted the priv-
ilege of eating cinders on the smoky end
chewing sand on the desert and digging
for switches in four feet of snow

  thats all the reward he wanted and
he did want that powerfully bad i sug-
gested that perhaps maggie mahorney
would like to have the breastpin and i
guaranteed to get him the brakemans
badge a switch-key and a lantern for i
knew how the trainmaster felt about the
ungainly chief clerk at hulbrook and
as this proved almost satisfactory to all
concerned the strike was declared settled

    in the final instalment of the story of almost next month mr herr tells how he
earned the right to sign orders

 recent railroad patents

it is apparently such little things as these that have made the
railroads of the united states and canada
the wonders of industry

equal brake-pressure -

one of the greatest difficulties experienced
in the operation of trains and particularly
freight-trains is the equalization of the
brake-pressure on the wheels in order to
simultaneously apply the brakes to the
wheels of every car of the train it is custom-
ary to maintain an air-pressure of about
twenty pounds to the square inch throughout
the entire brake system and when the brakes
are operated this pressure is exerted equally
against the wheels of empty cars as well as
against the wheels of heavily loaded cars
which vary greatly in weight according to
the character of tlie load carried

  this pressure applied to the wheels of an
unloaded car will stop the wheels entirely
and cause them to skid on the rails it will
not only wear flat places  the wheels but
will cause the cars of the train to bump
against each other which is very damaging
to the draft-rigging as well as to the bodv-
structure of the cars

  to overcome this disadvantage of the ordi-
nary brake-syslems frank d thomason of
chicago has patented no  decem-
ber   a brake-equalizing mechanism
which is so constructed that the weight of
cach car of a train will result in the wheels
of its trucks being moved toward their re-
spective brake-shoes a distance or degree
proportionate to the weight of the car

 rr

  as a result the wheels of a heavily loaded
car will be nearer their respective brake-
shoes than the wheels of an  empty and as
the pressure exerted by the brake-shoes in-
creases in ratio to the approach of the wheels
to the shoes greater braking pressure will
be applied to the wheels of the heavily loaded
cars than to the wheels of the  empties se-
curing the above-mentioned result



air-brake release-w h e n

the brake mechanism of any car of a train
becomes inoperative the train is stopped and
one of the trainmen must crawl beneath the
car and cut out the brakes of that particular
car this method results in the loss of
considerable time to say nothing of the dan-
ger involved

  to obviate this disadvantage simon p
cota of dickinson north dakota has pat-
ented no  december   a re-
lease for air-brake apparatus which may be
operated from within the car to which it is
applied

  the device is embodied in a valve which
is interposed in a branch pipe leading from
the train-pipe to the brake-cylinder and the
stem of this valve projects up through the
floor of the car a short distance so that it
may be opened or closed from within the
car




the railroad mans magazine

  as the valve-stern is turned to close the
valve an exhaust valve for the auxiliary
cylinder is opened at the same time so as to
relieve this cylinder of pressure

a

control for street

cars-a novel brake-control system for
 pay-as-you-enter  cars is shown in a pat-
ent no  january   issued to
frederick h lincoln of philadelphia as
it is customary in this class of cars to keep
the doors closed when the car is in motion
and only open them to allow passengers to
enter or leave the car this system will pre-
vent numerous accidents which might other-
wise occur

  motormen  such cars have acquired the
habit of first starting their car and then
closing the door and it not infrequently
happens that just at this moment a person
will attempt to either leave or board the
car forgetting that  foothold is afforded
when the door is closed or partly closed
conductors  such cars due we must say
to the necessity of taking on and discharg-
ing passengers as rapidly as possible have
become careless in guarding the exit doors
so that persons may leave by these doors
while the car is in motion

  the system of control devised by mr
lincoln while electrical in its nature is
very simple and renders it absolutely im-
possible for the motorman to start his car
while any of the doors are open as there
are exceptions to all rules however a switch
is provided which may be thrown in case
of emergency to permit of the car being
started while the doors are open



easy switching- a decidedly

advantageous switch construction is shown
in a patent no  january  
issued to archie k murray of johnstown
pennsylvania it has been adopted by one
of the largest switch manufacturing com-
panies in this country

  as is well known right and left hand
switches differ materially in construction the
parts in one arranged the reverse to the
parts in the other consequently two sets
of castings must be made

  t the switch disclosed in this patent how-
ever this is obviated and a single casting
of each part is all that is necessary to con-
struct either a right or a left hand switch
tn this switch construction the switch-rod
carries a member which may be reversed
and the spring for normally holding the
switch in one position or the other may be
disposed between this member and one wall

of the casing for the switch in order to
adapt it to a right or left hand curve as the
case may be

  it can be disposed between the said mem-
ber and a bracket upon another wall of the
casing to obtain the opposite result

creeping rails-devices for

preventing the creeping of railroad rails
have usually been embodied in clamps or
plates similar to the ordinary tie-plate but
such devices are generally too expensive for
extensive use

  one of the simplest means yet devised for
this purpose is shown in a patent no 
january xi  issued to edward t train-
er of portsmouth ohio mr trainer forms
in the base-flanges of the ordinary rail at
the proper points openings for the passage
of spikes of the ordinary construction and
through these openings are driven extra
spikes which serve to hold the rails in fixed
relation to the ties upon which they are
supported

  the ordinary spikes are also preferably
employed although their use is not abso-
lutely necessary



smaller tubes -now that sub-
ways are coming into general use improve-
ments are being made which tend to cut
down the initial expene of the construction
of the way itself

  to lessen the height of the tunnel on even
a short road would mean an enormous sa-
ving antoine b du pont of cleveland
ohio has managed to accomplish this result
without a counter-expense it is true that
he contemplates a change in the construction
of the cars used on such lines but the
change does not mean an increase in the cost
of manufacture of the cars

  the car devised by mr du pont is of the
ordinary construction except that the trucks
are located beyond the ends of the car in-
stead of beneath the car as is customary
in other words the car-body is supported
near the ground between twotrucks located
one at each end of the body and as a result
the height of the car is reduced to a degree
equal to the height of the trucks usually
employed



car-truck frame-a radi-
cal departure in the construction of car-
trucks is disclosed in a patent no 
december   issued to theodore w
remitters of st louis in this truck the
connection between the journal-boxes at
each side of the truck is in the form of a
recent railroad patents



  frame above which the bolsters of the truck
are positioned on the journal-boxes are
formed guides in which the ends of the
bolsters are guided

  springs are arranged between the bolsters
and the frame connecting the journal-boxes
and serve to support the bolsters in the usual
manner as a result of this arrangement
the bolsters are prevented from moving in
a-direction lengthwise of the car and are
guided in their up-and-down movement due
to the yield of the springs in a true vertical
direction

j

switch pivot-in a switch-point

pivot the principal wear is at the pivot and
on the under side of the switch-point or
tongue heretofore it has been difficult to
take up this wear except by tightening the
pivot which as a matter of fact only com-
pensates for the wear of the under side of
the tongue

  a switch-manufacturing company has
adopted a patent no  january 
 issued to heenan s goughnour of
johnstown pennsylvania which covers a
switch construction in which the wear of
both of these parts is automatically taken up

  i this switch there is a tapered projec-
tion on the floor of the switch which fits into
a similarly formed recess in the butt end of
the switch-tongue but this recess is of a
depth greater than the height of the projec-
tion so that as the pivot wears the tongue
settles and the wear is taken up

  it will be understood of course that the
projection and the recess in which it is re-
ceived affords the pivot for the tongue

fr s cleveland ohio- how

	should an inventor proceed in dis-
posing of his patent  a railroad device

   is it advisable to place a patent for
sale with a patent selling agency

 the best method is to have some com-
pany place the device in use on a short line

of their way and test it thoroughly if it

does the work better than present devices
and is not too expensive you will find no
trouble in disposing- of the rights if this
method proves too costly a small working
model placed with a large railway company
will probably do the work equally as well

    there are numerous agencies of this
character now in existence and many to the
sorrow of the inventor the usual scheme
is to collect a certain sum for advertising
which may or may not be given depending
upon the reliability of the concern in any
event the chief motive is to get the money
for either newspaper or correspondence ad-
vertising neither of which are of any avail
to the inventor of railway appliances the
method mentioned above with a few excep-
tions is the best and only reliable one to
follow

hr r-is it advisable for a patentee
 in this country to apply for patents
in all foreign countries

   no the general rule in such matters is
to apply only in the countries in which the
device is liable to be in actual demand fur-
thermore devices which would be useful in
railroading in this country would be worth-
less as a rule in other countries of course
there are exceptions but they are few and
definite advice can only be given regarding
specific questions in this line



sb-the patent office procedure is as

	follows applications for a patent
must be made in writing to the com-
missioner of patents the applicant must
also file in the patent office a written de-
scription of the invention or discovery and
of the manner and process of making con-
structing compounding and using it in such
full clear concise and exact terms as to
enable any person skilled in the art or science
to which it appertains or with which it is
most nearly connected to make construct
compound and use the same and in case of
a machine he must explain the principle
thereof and the best mode in which he has
contemplated applying that principle so as
to distinguish it from other inventions and
particularly point out and distinctly claim
the part improvement or combination which
he claims as his invention or discovery the
specification and claim must be signed by
the inventor and attested by two witnesses

tive on top of the earth anywhere he left
a will squire brown drawed it up as
you all know without me tellin you and
you all know besides that bub who took
care of the old man the last ten years or
so and was a mighty favorite of his too
heired all old jed had which wasnt
much as it turned out

   bub never was adopted according to
court by old jed but he always went by
the name of spivens just the same what
is bubs real name uncle henry 

   well now said that old gentleman
taking off his glasses that he might wipe
them with his blue bandanna  ill have
to calculate a bit bubs ma was orig-
nally susy whittington she married

   as i was about to say resumed
smiler  what bub heired didnt make
him rich though old jed was once pretty
well off and about a week ago he took a
notion hed go down to kansas city and
see if he couldnt get him a job in a
wholesale house or something

   he come to me thursday a week
ago and wondered what chance hed have
gettin to go down some time on a pass
when i was shippin a car or two o hogs

    best in the world bub i said
 come around monday and ill fix you
up want a pass for both ways he
allowed that he didnt he guessed he
wasnt calculatin on cornin back for a
spell if he could find anything to do

    all right i said  i believe ill
run down myself you come along about
six oclock monday mornin and well go
together

   he was on hand all right luggin
his grip and we piled into the caboose
and hit the trail

    smiler he says to me  kind of
watch around after me the first hour or
two when we get to the city to see that

bub got ten thousand dollars in cold hard cash for her


the railroad mans magazine

i dont get run over by one of these auty-
mobiles or somethin ye know im a
mighty green customer away from home
atchison is the biggest place i ever was
in he savs

    dont you fret bub i told him
 youll be all right with me to watch
alter you k c streets aint so wide but
what you can get across safe and sound
well bub and me got off the train
down in the yards and while they was
switchin the stock around to where they
belonged we went over to a restaurant
and got dinner bub left his grip there
and we started out to find a boardin-
house for him he said he had about ten
dollars in money to tide him over till he
struck some kind of a job

   we looked into two or three places
on the way up-town but they didnt seem
to suit bub for one reason of other he
allowed they were too dark and stuffy
and he didnt intend to risk his health
stayin in no such unsanitary rookeries as
them he said hed pay five dollars a week
before hed do it-

   thet wuz jest right too interrupt-
ed uncle henry  look at mace jor-
dan thet went down there to study den-
tstry roomed in a three-dollar-a-week
boardin-house an come home with the
consumption died inside o six months
and-

   bub foiid a place he liked drectly
and paid a dollar down to hold it till he
brought his grip when he was to fork
over the other two and a half then we
went down-town to see the sights you
ought to seen bub countin the stories in
the tall buildins he shore enjoyed em

    smiler just think of the money it
took to build these here stores he
pointed out one ten-story buildin- and
said hed pretty near bet that it hadnt
cost a cent less than a thousand dollars
to build i just laughed at him

  just about then somebody hollered
acrost the street at us and vvhod you
reckon it was but nate fisher-

   that low down cur said the major
that nate fisher skinned everybody
round here he ever had dealins with we
all know that he raised that note he held
on old jesse winthrop frm a hundred
dollars to nine thousand an made the
widder pay it-

   yes an all thet saved him wuz thet

  it couldnt be proved on him by hokv l 
said uncle henry  nate fisher would
rob his own ma an her down bed-fast
why i recollect once when he swin-
dled me out of a span o mules-

   yes nate had a little office with a
sign on it that said  real estate-loans
and insurance  smiler resumed  and
he was standin in the door  come
over he said to bub and me we felt
to see if our money was safe hid in our
inside pockets and went over nate was
as friendly as all get out

    well well he went on when we
got inside and took chairs in his little
office  i aint seen anybody from mud
lake for a year of- sundays hows
everything still clerkin in the store
smiler i told him i was buy-in and
shippin a little stock now and then he
allowed that was a good line of busi-
ness

     hows old jed spivens stackin up
bub   he ast  i spose you an him
are still operatin the hundred and fifty
acres down on the river

  jeds dead bub told him

    well well he said mighty sur-
prised a right nice old man jed was
you was his sole legatee wasnt you
bub

    hows that  ast bub puzzled

    you heired what he had didnt
you 

    yes but-

    sold the old farm yet bub nate
broke in without waitin for bub to fin-
ish what he started to say

    nope said bub

  whatll you take for it nate
come back with

    aw   bub kind of grinned  i
wouldnt want to swindle you that
there farm of mine is-

never mind said nate i know
what she is of course its run down
an all that but its good bottom land
an well watered bein on the river-
  yes it is bub agreed

    ill give you fifty an acre for her
bub nate said  sight unseen take it
or leave it what dye say 

    aw say now nate bub com-
menced i saw bub appeared to be kind
of confused so i butted in

    give him time to think it over
nate i said  fifty an acre is a fair
stung by heck



price but theres lots of land round mud
lake sellin for as high as seventy-five
an acre now

    yes but them kind of places has
mighty good improvements he said
 and you must remember im offerin
spot cash ill write you my check for
the total amount right
now what dye say

bub 

    of course he
went on  its under-
stood that you can
give me a clear title
to the place-

    yes that parts
all right said bub

 ive got the will an
all the papers in my
pocket right now

t here they are

but-

   nate was anx-
iouser than ever when
hed looked over the
will an seen that bub
was the sole heir to
the farm  no buts
goes he said  i
wont hold this offer
open bub you take
it now or its all off

what do ye say  

    well to tell the
truth- bub looked
like he hated to tell
the truth just then-

 ive had a better of-
fer than that nate
so i cant do noth-
in for you

 that set nate
afire- right away

why ive turned
down sixty dollars
an acre for it once bub went on  i
wouldnt be likely to take ten dollars
lessn that just cause it was you would
i   and bub never cracked a smile

   that stumped nate for a minute in
fact it stumped me i was beginnin to
suspicion that bub was foxier than he
looked so i kept still nate raised his
bid to sixty-five but bub didnt show
much interest finally he kind of
yawns and says to me

    come on smiler hadnt we bet-

ter be goin were just takin up nates
time for nothin

    bub ill give ye ten thousand dol-
lars in cold cash for that farm said
nate as we got up to go bub studied
it over a minute

    have you got the actual cash here

a	

ill set up the sardines if
it wasnt in yellow boys
and greenbacks

where i can look at it no check you
know he said finally

    no but you come along with me
to the bank an ill get it nate said
 you bet ye  it wont take ten minutes
smiler can wait here an amuse himself
in the office watchin the crowd go by
till we come back

   well in a quarter of an hour they
come back with some sacks and pack-
ages and ill set up the sardines to the
crowd if it wasnt ten thousand dollars


the railroad mans magazine

in yellow boys and greenbacks bub
had chose what he could carry handy
in gold and the rest in big bills i had to
heft it once in my hands just for luck by
george it was some money i say

   then we went in next door to where
there was one of these fellows that makes
out deeds and bub signed over the farm
to nate shook hands ancl away we went
with the money all we could lug

    wasnt you ashamed to do it bub 
i ast him as soon as wed put fifteen or
twenty blocks between us and nate

    i wouldve been if it hadnt been
for one thing he said  once when i
was a little kid i lost a five-dollar bill-
the only money i had an id been savin
it up by nickels an dimes for three months
to do the fair with an nate fisher
found it an kep it i know he found it
an im shore he kep it

    les go somewheres he said
 where we can buy us some dollar seegars
an hire one of these autymobiles to take
a ride around town in and thats what
we did you bet

  there- was an uproar of laughter and

comments when smiler finished- even
the major unbent himself enough to ex-
press his satisfaction in no half-hearted
terms and uncle henry hatfield laughed
until the tears dripped from his chin
he had once dealt with nate fisher in a
horse trade and revenge was sweet

  one man in the company did not join
in the hilarity fie was a traveling sales-
man from saint jo

  what is the funny part of it all
this person queried  wasnt the farm
anygood what the-

  dont ye ketch on uncle henry
said  this here farm o bubs avuz
swallered up in the hungry maw of the
mizzoury river durin the last two june
rises ever bit ofthet farm is caved into
th river ther aint enough of old ted
spivenss place left to plant a turnip on

   whered bub go to smiler  asked
the major

   the last i seen of him he give me a
hundred-dollar bill to keep to remember
him by and got on the train for seattle
said smiler  and he was togged up
like a banker too i say

educating signal-men

while it is perhaps too much to say
that each successive development in
the  art of signaling  demands a higher de-
gree of technical knowledge and skill on
the part of the average signal-man it is
true nevertheless that the general improve-
ments in quality and increases in quantity
of signal and interlocking apparatus occur
so rapidly that the signal-mans responsibili-
ties are constantly becoming greater

  the growing demand for books on signal-
ing and allied subjects and for other means
of individual study is evidence however
that lie is preparing himself to meet the
new conditions

  of great interest in this connection are
the methods which various signal depart-
ments are adopting to place educational fa-
cilities within reach of their members some
of these take the form of class instruction
conducted at some central point where at

intervals the men within reach assemble for
general work in certain fundamental sub-
jects and for open discussion of their prob-
lems and the methods of solving them

  others are more in the nature of indi-
vidual instruction such as the examining of
one man on his knowledge of a text-book
previously given him to read or upon the
rules of conduct in certain cases and the
reasons therefor or perhaps a series of
private lessons in a prescribed subject given
by a superior officer

  in all cases the methods employed are
those best calculated to meet the existing
conditions the comparatively large pro-
portions which some of the educational
movements have attained speak well for the
signal-mans appreciation of his opportunity
and the railroads realization of the value
of a better-equipped employee- the signal

a yard engine can make a flying switch better than a mogul each

  the record of 

by remsen crawford

it is seventeen years since engine  of the new york central reeled off
what was then the fastest mile on record with one exception it is still
the record we have built heavier engines that would pull longer trains
at a higher rate of speed for more hours than would the  but that wild
dash for the worlds record has been  gone better  but once

    naturally an engine built for speed and made to produce it day in and
day out could not be expected to last long at that sort of work old 
served her time as a thoroughbred and dropped back to the cart-horse class
for a time finallyfincling a comfortable place among the family dobbins of
the rail she is still to be found in the latter class receiving the reward of a
long and useful life

career of the engine that established a new worlds record for
speed in  which has been beaten but
once since that time

them had a story to tell and they were
trying to talk all at once

  presently there came a distinct peal
from a bell-more nervous more earnest
wilder than the rest it carried the un-
mistakable expression of a locomotive en-
tering a city after a wearisome journey
and soon the massive form came in view
at the head of a train of passenger-cars
like a black giantess with a string of toys

  nearer clearer came the wild warning
clanging tone as the giantess pulled in
and glided to a halt alongside the plat-
form

meeting an old friend

  i began to run my eyes over the perfect
form and figure of the great iron creature
before me a habit i formed years ago
when my duties threw me with machinists

secies began in the february railroad mans magazine single copies  cents

little while ago i min-
gled with the throng of
happy home-comers hock-
ing like migratory birds
from the thousand islands
of the st lawrence river
the little town of clayton new york
nestling close beside the upper neck of
lake ontario was literally filled that day
with its annual pilgrimage of summer
tourists

  like a veritable army they came on
lake or river craft and crowded about the
railroad station clamoring for baggage-
checks chattering like magpies and dri-
ving the ticket-agent to madness with a
million questions

  out in the railroad yards the engines
were holding high carnival their clang-
ing bells and coughing smoke-stacks
sounding for all the world as if each of




the railroad mans magazine

and railroad experts there was some-
thing familiar about this colossal engine
-familiar as a letter from home

  i was wondering where i had seen her
before when there shone forth from her
shielded breast that historic magic name
-

  i had found an old acquaintance in the
crowd thirteen years ago i had been
introduced to her in chicago by charley
hogan the daring engineer who loved
her as he would his bride even then i
had not felt as a stranger in the presence
of  for who had not heard of 
with her record of a mile in thirty-two
seconds 

  she it was that revolutionized railroad-
ing  that set a new pace for express-
trains  that brought chicago nearer to
new york and became the pet of the
plutocrats who owned her the pride of
the nation which adored her yes i
knew every chapter of her life

  like thousands of others i had read
of her birth in the smoky shops of the
new york central in april  how
she had been hailed as a creature of
destiny fashioned as she was for the mis-
sion of mocking at all the records of
speed how she had gone forth and with
greatest ease torn these records asunder
on her first trip sending word to cornelius
vanderbilt to put on the dream of his
life-his twenty-hour train to chicago

  i knew how she handled that train in
the years that followed in a way to scatter
consternation among the britishers with
their east shore and west shore flyers
by settling upon this country the cham-
pionship of fast long-distance travel

her last days

  i had seen her there at chicago on ex-
hibition in the heyday of her triumph
where thousands of worlds fair visitors
thronged about the pedestal where she sat
like an enthroned queen of iron twirling
her great drivers i had seen her flying
through country towns

  i had seen her in the grand central
station at new york when mechanical
engineers and all manner of men of con-
structive genius gathered around her for
study

  and here she was at last lost in ob-
livion to the great main line current of

traffic pulling a train of cars on the
rome watertown and ogdensburg di-
vision of the new york central between
syracuse and clayton

   how are the mighty fallen   was my
first thought and i looked with a sort of
sympathy upon the handsome creature
which seemed to speak like something
near human with her air-pumps groaning
and breathing as if winded and worn out
by the journey she had just made through
the clover-covered hills of northern new
york i wondered what had become of
this world-famed locomotive all these re-
cent years when nothing has been heard
of her

mr vanderbilts orders

  i was anxious to get accurate reliable
information about her history in detail
and determined to put myself in commu-
nication with all those who have been her
keepers and her associates since she was
first led out of the west albany shops to
awaken the world

  from w o thompson division super-
intendent of motive power of the new
york central at oswego john howard
the superintendent at new york and
charles h hogan now division superin-
tendent of motive power at buffalo and
formerly her engineer who was with her
when she broke the worlds record i have
gathered the full story of 

  engine  first glided out of the rail-
road shops of the new york central at
west albany one morning in april 
one of the vanderbilts had given orders
for an engine to be made that would travel
faster than anything under steam had
traveled

  he had watched the advances in rail-
roading and locomotive construction in
england and at home he had a keen
sense of the competition that was increas-
ing every day among the railroads of
america

  he had studied the natureof americans
and knew that they were a people of great
haste and impatience willing to take risks
beyond all other peoples of the world to
gain a point he knew that the compe-
tition of great american trunk lines for
the future was essentially a competition
in speed

  besides that was the year of all years
the record of 



for the great vanderbilt system of trans-
portation lines to make a showing it
was a festival year in the progress of
the american republic-the year of the
chicago worlds fair the greatest ex-
hibition of things industrial ever known

cutting the time to chicago

   we must bring chicago several hours
closer to new york he said repeatedly
at meetings of the directors of the new
york central we have spent millions
to make the road-bed safe and sound
what we want now is an engine that will
go the gait

   have one built at any cost put
drivers on her big enough to cover a good
jump at every stroke of the piston-rod
and put enough steam into her cylinders
to keep those drivers busy

  the order went to the master mechan-
ics and they set to work the outcome
was  a greyhound of iron

  when she rolled out of the west al-
bany shops that april morning charley
hogan was there to take her in hand he
was an experienced engineer a man of
nerve and determination whose whole
life centered in his work and who on
many occasions had shown himself ready
when danger lurked about his path of
duty

  take that engine and break the
worlds record was the order hogan
received

   give her to me just one day ahead of
the test he replied  i want to take her
for a gallop all on the quiet just to see
how she behaves herself

 a  warming-up  canter

  he was told to take  for as long a
time as he wanted to make the tests prior
to putting her on record publicly so
the first day out was all for charley
hogans personal benefit and satisfaction

  hogan looked at the great driving-
wheels taller than himself and knew that
with their seven-foot diameter they would
cover twenty-two feet of rail at every
stroke from the cylinders he examined
all the machinery and gear and noted
wherein it differed from other engines he
had ridden

  fie knew the laws regulating steam

pressure- and the power such pressure
would engender fie was thoroughly in-
formed as to the inward nature of this
new departure in locomotive construction
all that remained was for him to get the
woii out of 

  with a feeling of pride he sprang into
the cab and flung himself on the seat be-
side the throttle shining in the sun like-
a jewel  glided as gracefully as a
sprite over the side-tracks andonto the
ponderous steel rails of the main line

  charley hogan touched the throttle
again and the massive engine bounded
forward sensitive as a tender colt under
the lash on and on she sped at a swift
clip each time smarting under a pull at
the throttle and hissing like a wild pan-
ther with each flush of steam

  now and then hogan closed the throt-
tle by degrees and saw that  slackened
her speed quite as obediently as she had
picked it up when the throttle was opened
he tested her brakes time and again and
saw that they would warrant him in ta-
king the bridle off if he chose but hogan
didnt choose to that day

the real thing

  his stop-watch had told him that 
was already a record - breaker and he
wanted to have something up his sleeve
in the way of a surprise when the time
came for him to make the real public run

  he did notget all out of her that he
knew to be in her on that trial trip but
when he took her to the roundhouse at
syracuse that night he had established
a record in her-favor of one hundred and
two miles an hour and he knew by the
way he saw her bound ahead at the slight-
est touch of the throttle that she would go
faster

  it was on may  s that the real
test came-a race against every locomo-
tive engine on the face of theearth char-
ley hogan was ordered to take  to
syracuse meet the empire state express
there couple onto the train and take it
to buffalo as fast as he could

  by this time it was generally known
that this new engine was out for the
scalps of every engine in service specu-
lation ran high in railroad circles as to
whether the locomotive could do what had
been mapped out for her


the railroad mans magazine

  hogan had kept his little joke all to
liimself he knew that  could  de-
liver the goods

  he played with her a trifle after the
city of syracuse was behind him just to
see if she was in the same humor as-when
he first tried her out he saw that she
was if anything she seemed all the
more anxious to be turned loose but ho-
gan held her down to an easy gait and
made rochester  the minute

a new worlds record

  he knew his road-bed better between
rochester and buffalo he gave the
throttle a nice little squeeze and 
sprang forward like a nimble horse ap-
proaching the town of batavia she was
rushing along at an easy gait

  hogan touched the throttle again and
held his hand there while he watched his
timepiece then it was that  shook
herself with a tremble as a racehorse does
when a jockey digs the spurs into its
flanks gave the cars a suggestive jerk
and settled down in earnest

  she equaled the worlds record with
great ease making a mile in thirty-five
seconds and charley hogan looked at
the fireman and smiled he pulled again
at the throttle and murmured to himself
 now then well go after that record
and set a new pace for the world 

  this seemed to be what  had longed
for all the time for never before had ho-
gan pulled his throttle wide her great
drivers sped round beneath her with mar-
velous rapidity each time they turned
throwing the great mass of iron twenty-
two feet forward charley hogan was
all eyes then for he had to keep a view
of the track ahead and watch his time-
piece too the other timekeepers on the
train were all busy with their watches

  telegraph-poles multiplied in hogans
vision as they had never multiplied be-
fore with a buzzing of air the engineer
vaguely saw the mile - post ahead and
fixed his eyes npon his watch the mile
had been covered in thirty-two seconds
the worlds record had been beaten for
a single mile by three seconds and hogan
sped on at the same gait to crittenden
many miles farther

  that very day the executive committee
of the new york central railroad held

a meeting-sind waited for the news from
 when it came they voted to put on
the twenty-hour train between new york
and chicago they also determined to
put  on exhibit at the worlds fair
and charley hogan was sent along with
her

  the engine and her master were greet-
ed there by thousands and  became al-
most a household word she had estab-
lished a gait of  miles an hour which
had never been dreamed of and which has
been excelled but once since when the
philadelphia andreading ran a train 
miles in two minutes and thirty seconds
near egg harbor pennsylvania in july
 which is equal to  miles an
hour

  afterward  was brought back east
and put in service as the star engine of
the empire state express charley ho-
gan still at the throttle on various occa-
sions he turned her loose each time show-
ing that she was true to the record she
had set

  her service for several years also
proved that the public notion that she
was built as an advertisement only was
false the engine did excellent service
in pulling with safety and at great speed
heavy trains of cars on both- the new
york and the buffalo divisions of the line

hauling a milk-train

  as travel increased however the de-
mand for a more powerful engine grew
and the type now in use for pulling the
empire state express is much heavier
much stronger and also very speedy
though the record of  has never been
equaled by any of the newcomers

  strange as it may appear neither of her
twin sisters  and  equaled the
speed test that  bore so easily and
equally strange it is that although ar-
chie buchanan ed chase and half a
dozen other crack engineers have han-
dled  she has never consented to show
her speed with them at the throttle as she
did to charley hogan

  after she had been replaced by stron-
ger locomotives on the main line  was
put to hauling a malk-train in this ludi-
crous role she became lie target for the
bright and witty fellows of the press and
one of them printed a very pathetic in-
the record of 



terview with the old engine which he
said she gave him on a side-track in the
freight-yards of the new york central

  her wheels were cut down from eightv-
four to seventy inches and she was sent
to the r w and o division for use
division superintendent of motive-power
w o thompson thought too much of
her to give her an ordinary task and she
is now pulling what is known as the syra-
cuse and clayton club train which is
ordinarily composed of a buffet-car three
parlor-cars and two first-class coaches

  the schedule puts a speed on her of
about forty-five miles an hour and she

handles the train in a highly successful
manner the engine is practically the
same now that she was when she made her
record-breaking run except that she has
a little smaller driver and a new boiler

  charley hogan her favorite engineer
has been promoted to division superintend-
ent of tlie buffalo division of the new
york central with headquarters at de-
pew new york he frequently gets let-
ters from all parts of the world asking
him about  and how he felt when she
took him over that mile in thirty-two sec-
onds  but hogan is a modest man and
hardly ever talks about the incident

prizes for apprentices

grand trunk shows how it appreciates the motive power of a
special reward for superior work

the winning of a prize however small
has a fascination and stimulus entirely
out of proportion to the value of the reward
there is a sort of  glory of conquest  in
beating everybody else to a fixed goal that
appeals to human nature especially to the
young the grand trunk railway takes ad-
vantage of this instinct among its appren-
tices every year in every shop it offers
prizes for excellence says the railway and
engineering review

   the annual competitive examinations is
always conducted by the companys chief
draftsman from montreal and has just been
completed at all the large shops along the
system prizes are awarded to the appren-
tices obtaining the highest average in their
respective years

   these prizes amount to  for each shop
and arc distributed over the different years
of apprenticeship thus the apprentice ob-
taining the highest average for his first year
in mechanical drawing gets  the highest
in practical mechanics  also so it is possi-
ble for one apprentice to obtain both prizes

  a keen interest is taken in this examina-
tion which takes the form of a contest be-
tween the various shops in addition lo the

prizes as stated above there is a capital prize
offered of  for each subject this is com-
peted for by the apprentices obtaining the
highest averages in drawing and practical
mechanics at their respective stations

   these apprentices are given a trip to
some point  the system where the final
examinations are held and the one receiving
the highest number of points in each subject
receives the amount stated

   this added to what he has received at
his station will make a total of   or
 if he has been successful in all subjects

   after the season has closed the boys at
some of the large shops hold what is termed
 apprentice night this is the social event
of the season each one makes a drawing
which is neatly gotten up and inked in

   this is placed on exhibition and the
prizes are awarded for each year of appren-
ticeship these prizes amount to  for
the first prize and  for the second prize

   there are also prizes offered for special
colored drawings amounting to  for first
prize and  for second prize this may
be competed for by any apprentice irre-
spective of his year and considerable interest
is manifested by those of artistic ability
always a railroad man

by e a spears

an old eagle-eye talks aboyt business systems in railroading and
why it is hard to quit when once you have eaten cinders

piey-ve got railroad bookkeeping
down to a fine point said an old
eagle-eye  for example they can turn
to their records and learn just what an en-
gine has cost to rim and how much the
engine has earned

  if my engine needs a flag i am ordered
to get it and it is charged up against the
engine and the company knows that i got
it they know how long it takes for an
engine to earn back what it costs they
can figure out how much a depot is worth
and when they build a new depot they know
how long it will be before they get back
what they have spent

   in old days if a car jumped the track
the crew would lay it to the bad road-bed
and this department would lay it to the
crew to-day it is different there is
more team work and a greater desire to
help one another

   now according to the rules a brake-
man is not supposed to shovel coal for a
fireman and a fireman is not supposed to
disconnect an engine for a brakeman when
water is being taken but in an emergency the
brakeman is doing the proper thing if lie
helps the fireman to shovel down coal in
the tender one trainman i know was
fired because he delayed a train twenty-
five minutes by just such a refusal fie
wasnt cooperating

   speaking about cooperating did you
ever read a statement on the subject post-
ed in the various roundhouses and depots
 the new york central president
brown is full of the idea it isnt just talk
but he means what he says he is one of
the friendliest of men you ever knew

   we railroad men would be sitting
around and brown would come walking in
everybody would be quiet as a mouse
brown would say

  you neednt be afraid of me boys
and then he would commence to talk in a
friendly manner before long he would
get deep into the subject of railroading
and he would tell what the road is trying
to do

   when he gets interested he almost
cries every one likes brown he worked

up from the bottom and has a deep regard
for every man on the road any man with
a grievance can carry jt straight to brown
and he will listen

   the men would do anything for brown
it makes all the difference in the world
how the boss stands with you while i
was working on another road there was
one boss we all liked when he asked us
to do anything we did it speedily and cheer-
fully but the other fellow would try to
boss us about as though we were slaves

   when he was out of sight wed loaf
when i got ready to quit i quit gladly

   speaking about quitting a whole lot of
railroad men are just ready to quit they
keep saying  well im going to quit but
they never do theres something fasci-
nating about railroading you come home
dead tired and swear that youll never go
back again but there you are just as sure
as fate an engineer i know says that
every trip will be his last but it isnt

   i said once to a fireman who was talk-
ing about quitting

  why man youre earning four or five
dollars a day what would you do if you
quit-you are too old to learn anything
else  

  he said well i guess t can do car-
pentry just as i did before  came on the
road

   he thinks he could but he couldnt
he has forgotten a lot of carpentry and
besides he would be twenty years behind
the times

   i know a conductor who got fired he
was earning good money but now he is
cleaning streets another man works in
a brewery another works about a hotel
and i know quite a number that have jobs
which pay about a third what they got on
the road they left too old to learn some-
thing that paid as well as railroading

  if they have saved they may start a
small business but they will not be up-to-
date in that business railroading is hard
work it pays well and there is something
about it that makes it hard to cut loose
from it once a railroad mail always a
railroad man
breaking the combine

by william s wright

            when men are bound together for no
            good purpose it is well to interfere

chapter v

greek meets greek

bout ten minutes later the
fire - gong clanged to
leighs astonishment no
man rose to ascertain
the location of the fire
by consulting the signal-
book  four-nine-three he said as
the gong beat out the signal-numbers for
the third time if i recollect aright
thats at atwood and river streets-tene-
ment - house district with the folsbee
paint-factory in the middle of it and
lie reached for his hat

  where are you going cried hal-
stead

   to see what the fire amounts to said
leigh curtly

 aw sit down laughed the other

 and get used to the ways of this crowd
we dont go out on first-alarm fires-
only third alarms

  but asked leigh  suppose things
break loose on your first alarm-as theyre
likely to-what then some of these
dinky little fires give up the most news

   we hear of them through police head-
quarters or somebody calls us up from
the precinct station-house or if an am-
bulance has been wanted the hospital doc-
tors usually give us the tip over the tele-
phone explained el

   easy times you must have remarked
leigh tentatively

   sure thing said ely  else whats
the use of a  combine   

  leigh looked doubtfully at the speak-
er  you must miss a whole lot of good
stuff waiting for news instead of hustling
for it he said

began in the march railroad mans

   we get all the news that we want
snapped ely  and - i dont think we
want any advice on the subject as a
committee of ways and means this crowd
up to date is satisfied with itself and its
methods of doing tilings give-me three
cards cronson

   keep your hat on ely remarked
allen  you forget that billys a stran-
ger to us and that in consequence lies got
a right to ask questions as a matter of
fact we do let a bunch of news give us the
go-by every day just because were too
lazy or dopey te grab it

  keno howled griggs suddenlv
awakening and as suddenly going to
sleep again

   griggs and allen seem to think that
theyre on  space like leigh is said ely
maliciously

  allen flushed if i were maybe id
make you make a bluff at earning your
living he retorted  it isnt by reason
of your society being so everlastingly fas-
cinating ely that im found in it for
some hours daily its only because-

 oh stop growling you two inter-
posed halstead  or have it out when the
games finished your ante bronson
the men subsided as bidden and leigh
again moved toward the door

  hold-on a minute billy ill go
with you said allen suddenly  and 
-he glanced at griggs- i think a walk
would do him good too eh 

  leigh assented griggs was protest-
ingly hoisted to his feet his face swabbed
with a towel dipped in ice-water and
after a brief struggle-during which al-
len administered what he described as the
 facial percussion treatment  with the
flat of his huge hands-griggs departed
peacefully with the others

magazine single copies  cents


the railroad mans magazine

  the fire did not amount to anything
apart from the panic which is the accus-
tomed accompaniment of a tenement-
house blaze  so the trio-griggs having
become his own man again-turned to go

   where now  asked allen

  leigh pulled out his note-book and
read off a list of happenings that were
to take place in the district during the
evening-it was then only half past seven
oclock

  allen looked puzzled  youre surely
not going to look after all of these  he
asked

   wont the rest of the fellows handle
some of them  asked leigh

  the other shook his head  no im
pretty sure thev wont

   and why not 

   well said allen hesitatingly  we
-that is they-dont trouble with much
outside of the  must  matter of the dis-
trict

  leigh made a gesture of impatience
 well jimmie just for once break the
rules and come along with me

  the other shook his head but hesitated
nevertheless  im one of the combine
you must remember he said laughingly

   and im sorry you are considering
what the combine is replied leigh
gravely

  allen grunted and griggs snickered

  leigh didnt pursue the subject further
and the two walked a block in silence
leigh halted as a cross-town car-track
was reached

   im going over to columbia hall to
the highburg board of trade meeting
he announced  understand theyre go-
ing to get busy with burke and his crowd
to-night over the main way improvement
and other local contracts we have a hint
that there will be a red-hot time of it
and that the preliminaries looking to a
legislative investigation of burke and his
crowd are to be put in play

  allen looked at him queerly  you
know i suppose billy that-that-burke
is a pretty decent fellow

   never heard it till now thought he
was about as bad as they make em po-
litically and in other ways but sup-
posing that he deserves your good-con-
duct badge whats that to do with the
board meeting 

  the other looked uncomfortable

   well ill put it another way then
replied allen  he stands well with the
combination

   and

   the combination doesnt like to see
its friends get the rowel

   have you been asked to tell me
this said leigh looking allen square-
ly in the face

   i have notr billy was the instant an-
swer  but you and i have always hit it
well together and-and-well i dont
want to see a good fellow like you run
up against a barbedwire fence as some
of your predecessors have done-to their
disadvantage

  leigh smiled  i appreciate the warn-
ing jimmie but when the combine pays
me my salary ill do by it and its friends
as it wishes and not before it may think
it owns highburg but its beautifully
mistaken if it thinks it owns me

   the others talked like that said al-
len with a note of pleading hi his voice
 good for them im sorry that they
didnt last out was the reply

  a car hove in sight  will you come
along asked leigh

  no said the other but he looked
wistfully at his friend

   then good-by for the present cried
leigh as he caught the car on the fly
 ill see you later at the municipal

  at about eleven oclock leigh true to
his promise appeared at the reporters
quarters five of the combine were pres-
ent including allen the poker - game
was still on

  anything doing he asked cheer-
fully

  jennison the dean of the combine and
representative of the martport gazette
exchanged glances with the others

   have you got anything  he said

   yes replied leigh producing a
note-book and copy  good stuff at that
want to take any of it 

   id like to hear what you have first
growled jennison  maybe well use it
and maybe we wont his tone was a
challenge

  leigh felt that a crisis was approach-
ing then he proceeded to read noting
however that none of the others were ta-
king notes of his items when he had
concluded jennison spoke again

   that kidnaping affair in the fifth pre-
breaking the combine

cinct will probably turn out to be just an
ordinary case of lost kid i dont take
any stock in it and wont write it un-
derstand if the strausssugar-house ac-
cident had been as out of the ordinary as
you say it was its queer that we didnt
hear of it from dr bayliss of st marys
hospital as we dont usually go over
the docs head we wont use that gither
about the board of trade meeting well
send in a few words

  leigh looked at him  did i make
myself quite clear he asked sena-
tor clives and assemblyman potter de
liberately charged burke and his asso-
ciates with out-and-out theft and pledged
themselves to set the wheels of legal and
legislative machinery in motion to punish
them their speeches were the culmina-
tion of a whole lot of sizzling oratory
oh snorted jennison those stiffs
are all hot air burke is it in this dis-
trict and cares  more for the gassing of
that crowd than he does for a ten-spot
when one of the boys needs it burkes
all right

  leigh felt himself growing hot at the
clumsy hint of the speaker but managed
to keep control of his temper just then
he glanced at allen and the expression on
the latters face puzzled him it seemed
as if the big fellow was encouraging him
to continue the controversy which in-
deed leigh was only too willing to do
being in no humor for compromise and
feeling too that he had reached the part-
ing of the ways

   leigh- began ely

   youll kindly hold your tongue ins
terrupted allen a gleam of battle-light
coming in his eyes  leighs got the
floor

  ely scowled and leigh resumed

 burke may be all right as you know
him but thats  reason why i should
kill a piece of news in which he figures
 leighs on space you know said
ely with a grin addressing jennison

   and if leigh wasnt  space re-
torted that individual  he would do pres
cisely as lies now doing it would al-
most seem lily as if you were not in the
district to getnews but to keep mum
about burke in return for burkes rum
 rime and reason chuckled griggs
ely again opened his mouth to reply
and once more allen cut him short

     r r

   shut up  he said angrily  this is
between leigh and jennison when they
get through you can butt in meantime
put the nippers on that wagging jaw of
yours

  jennison rose and lit his pipe  we
may as well understand each other first as
last he said turning to leigh  if you
care to come into the combine youre wel-
come provided you do as the combine
does but ive a shrewd notion that youre
in the district for the express purpose of
going it alone maybe im wrong but i
think im right youre a clever boy
leigh but if you imagine that you can
down this little coterie as easily as youve
done some other star jobs on the record
youre mistaken

   i think replied leigh slowly  that
its come to a show-down im here to
get the news of highburg-and i intend
to get it if  tread on the corns of you
fellows or those of your friends i shall be
sorry-but im out for the news all the
same

   dont be a fool broke in halstead
 even as it is theres sufficient space in
this job-plus your salary - to satisfy
your-lust for dollars billy

   the job might satisfy his pocket but
not his conscience you know said jennis
son with a lumbering attempt at sar-
casm

   i dont consider you an authority on
matters of conscience retorted leigh
 anyhow ill have none of the combine
as its now run in mine  so good night

   go and be hanged  snarled jenni-
son  a couple of weeks hence youll be
begging us to let you come back into the
fold

   i dont think so said allen sudden-
ly  leighs  cur and all of the
combine is not of your way of thinking
either



chapter vi

the first gun fired

tennison and the rest looked at him
 with mute amazement allen was
bundling together copy paper note-
books tobacco-box pipes and other of
his belongings

   leighs estimate of this gang and its
ways is about right he said wrathfully


the railroad mans magazine

stopping suddenly in his work and turn-
ing to the others  were a measly lot
of muckers who sell our souls for gratis
booze and a microscopic share-of the big
graft that the burke species couldnt get
within a mile of if we didnt keep our
pencils quiet

   a sweet wholesome lovable congre-
gation we are he went on his voice
booming with self-contempt and anger
 gorgeous specimens of  gentlemen of
the press oh and a gritty lot too-
such a gritty lot afraid to even claim
whats coming to us as accomplices of the
gang that runs this district that engineers
the rotten deals which have made high-
burg notorious

  are you crazy allen cried jen-
nison

  no nor drunk said the other fierce-
ly  but leighs stand on the matter has
brought to a head my determination-
that isnt by any means new-to cut the
combine-

   rot  cried halstead

  truth replied allen ill not
stand in any longer with- here leigh
lets get out of this or ill be saying
things that ill be sorry for

   youll be sorry for what you have
said declared jennison threateningly

  leigh took the other by the arm before
he could reply faced him toward the door
and without further words the pair left
the municipal allen was hot with ex-
citement

   i want a drink billy he declared
as they drew near the cafe at the next
corner

   youll drink-ice-water-at my-at
our office replied leigh   nothing else
until we have sent our copy down

   your office 

   yep i looked for this rumpus and
so got quarters beforehand its a block
farther up-first floor-over higginss
drug-store snug place and ive a tele-
phone installed also two desks

 two

  to tell the truth jimmie i half-
expected that id succeed in persuading
you to break with that crowd anyhow

i intended to try but i didnt look for
the rupture to come about quite so sud-
denly

   nor i although it was inevitable
but i heard a tale to-night after i left

you about certain easy money that came
to ely recently that sickened me-and
so the explosion still as i said ive
been thinking over this step for a month
or two im not quite a bad un billy
and my little tears have always been of
the impulsive sort

   but this cool business of sitting down
and making a permanent job of booze
and loafing and borrowing is too much
for me you-r coming here was a god-
send there is many a man who reallv
wishes to get out of the gutter but cant
manage it simply because his moral knees
are a bit too weak to help him onto the
sidewalk of decency

   thats the time for the friendly hand
to get in its fine work my moral plans
and specifications arent in keeping with
my chest development im afraid - in
which respect you have the advantage of
me and he clapped leigh affection-
ately on the shoulder

   youre all to the good jimmie said
leigh heartily adding with a chuckle
 its been an iridescent evening the
inventory to date includes a fight with the
combine a news sensation for to-morrow
the rescue of a good fellow from perdi-
tion and trouble ahead

   and a bad beginning for the com-
bine ill bet those fellows are worried
said allen

   not as much as they will be though
by the big blue pencil but well make
em work 

   you couldnt hurt their feelings
worse than by causing them to do that
remarked the other with another cavern-
ous smile

  and then they reached their destina-
tion and wrote and telephoned news to
their respective papers until nearly
two am

  leigh that same morning published
in the sentinel the proposed burke inves-
tigation  and as he had written it it was
as staynes remarked  hot stuff the
kidnaping case too made interesting
reading there were also half a dozen
other good items the nights work had
been entirely satisfactory

  allen had done nearly as well  so much
so indeed that the city editor of the
clarion telephoned him asking the where-
fore of his unwonted industry the news-
papers of the combine had as jennison
liad promised but a few lines of the
burke sensation in consequence there
was a lurid and general calling down of
the combine members by their several edi-
tors the replies to which were that the
sentinel story was more of a fake

  jennison and the rest of the combine
began to feverishly plan for leighs and
allens undoing

  before he went over to highburg that
evening leigh dropped in at the sentinel
office staynes greeted him heartily
 ridgelys highly delighted over the
burke story he said  billy youre the
only cereal are you going to give us
more of the same to-night

   i guess so-including a talk with
burke if liell talk and sam i now
expect trouble the combine will among
other things see to it that i dont get
much out of the station-house blotters
so get your police headquarters man to
keep his eye  any slips that come from
the highburg precincts ahd ring me up
if he notes anything important

   it shall be done said staynes  and
dont hesitate to let me know if at any
time you want any help

  i wont but ive a good man to work
with as it is and he told the tale of
allens withdrawal from the combine

  the city editor laughed  tis the lit-
tle rift within the lute of the combine
billy he said gleefully

   yes replied leigh   but tis only
the commencement remember and therell
be music in the air before the end comes
not far from the druggists over which
he had made his headquarters leigh ac-
tually ran into burke when he was leav-
ing a cigar-store now the politician
knew the foolishness of unnecessarily an-
tagonizing a newspaper man in the lat-
ters personal capacity so he caught
leigh by the arm as if he were trying to
save him from a fall laughing heartily as
he did so

  hallo leigh he cried that
you trying to break my neck are you
i think thats rubbing it in after the

	roast  i got in the papers to-day and
again he laughed-a well-fed well-oiled
well-trained laugh

  leigh said something in the way of
apology and added

    was going to look you up later to
ask if you had anything to say regarding

my article this meeting will save me
that trouble if you can give me ten min-
utes

   ten minutes my boy  cried the
other why cert half an hour if
you want it come down to my place and
well open a small bottle

   no said leigh  lets go to my of-
fice well be free from interruption
there

  your office asked burke with a
capital affectation of surprise  why
arent you down with the rest of the boys
at the municipal you know youre wel-
come there however much you pound me

  leigh glanced at him understanding
perfectly that he knew

   oh thats all right he said
 thanks just the same but i like a
quiet life and-here we are

  he led the way up-stairs the poli-
tician noted the telephone and other sug-
gestions of permanent occupation

   you look as if you thought you were
here to stay he said and the reporter de-
tected a tinge of malice in the remark

   yes replied leigh easily  thats
what im here for and now as i dont
want to detain you let me ask-

  so he put a lot of questions relative to
the charges made against burke at the
board of trade meeting some were an-
swered direct others evaded and yet oth-
ers failed of reply altogether because so
the politician alleged he knew nothing of
their subject-matter

  the interview ended and burke rose
 i suppose the sentinels going for me
again to-morrow   he asked with a care-
less smile

  leigh smiled back but replied not

   why have you got it in for me
billy went  the boss good-na-
turedly  was i ever up against you in
any way

   no said leigh rather sharply and
if you had been it wouldnt have made
the slightest difference one way or the
other its a plain proposition burke-
that and nothing more im in this dis-
trict for the news and the news i pro-
pose to get

   just now you happen to be the news
youre the best judge as to whether you
are or are not to blame for that fact but
theres no personal equation in this so
far as i am concerned if the board of


the railroad mans magazine

trade had voted you a halo instead of
handing you the remarks that it did i
should have written the proceedings just
the same-as news

   and news it would have been in-
deed replied the other with a grim
chuckle  well ill be going but i
hope that outside of business well be
friends

   i never ask too much of human na-
ture replied leigh with a laugh that
however didnt veil the meaning of his
words

   nor i he stopped on his way to
the door and faced the reporter  i like
an honest fighter like you leigh and as
i said before i hope well be friends
come what may but and he spoke
very slowly and deliberately  i think
youre making a fool of yourself that
little row at columbia hall dont amount
to a pinch of snuff youre not familiar
with things in highburg or you wouldnt
attach any importance to it why those
long-eared mules-

  is this for publication asked
leigh in accordance with reportorial
etiquette

   i dont give a flip whether you write
it or not replied burke  the point
im getting at is this we-myself and
friends - happen to be running affairs
hereabouts just now the other fellows
are squealing because theyre not in on
the game by the looks of things theyre
likely to remain out of it for a long time
in fact  dont see how theyre going to
sit in anyhow consequently while they
may make a whole lot of noise no harms
coming to any one on this side of the
house see you aint a baby leigh
you know what practical politics are

   and this too is for publication i
suppose said the reporter

  no it isnt replied burke bluffly
 its for you and you only its this way
whats the use of you making yourself un-
popular among people who have the
power and who are willing to be friends
of yours 

  friends said leigh quietly in
what way

   any way you like replied the other
significantly

   i wish you hadnt said this to me
why asked burke staring in a
puzzled fashion

   of course i understand what you
mean and so there is only one way of
replying

   that being

   well said leigh with a smile
 youll find out soon enough but youre
not the only practical politician who has
made the same blunder

    ill be shot if i know what youre get-
ting at billy replied the boss

   the fact is mr burke said leigh
very deliberately  that youre so used to
mixing up with people who can be bought
at a price that you imagine every man has
his price-when you want to buy him
and therein lies your mistake

   its a fair proposition anyway re-
turned burke  i never ask a man to do
anything for me that i aint willing to
pay for

   if you think its worth paying for at
your figure you mean i dont think that
we need talk further about the point in-
volved replied leigh  youll have to
excuse me for ive a lot to do

  burke didnt go on the instant how-
ever instead he came back into the
room a little way

   youre going to declare war then
he cried with another hearty laugh

   no said leigh  but im going to
tell the truth about highburg-and some
of its people

   umph  snorted the politician
telling the truth as you call it aint
always the way to keep the peace

       chapter vii
       in working order

teigh didnt answer and burke
- again made for the door  well
billy good night to you and remem-
ber that alls fair in love and war he
said

  the reporter turned to him with a con-
fident laugh  you intend that as a hint
as to what i am to expect but you havent
a monopoly on everything and everybody
hereabouts - especially the ear of the
public

  leigh worked on his interview with
boss burke for an hour or so and then
went to hunt up some of the board of
trade members on his return to the
office at nine oclock he found somewhat
breaking the combine



to his surprise that allen had not turned
up

  consoling himself with the thought
that allen was probably going the rounds
of the district and would presently put
in an appearance he turned to the burke
matter once more just as he finished
writing the telephone-bell rang allen
was on the wire

   that you billy 

   yes

   im sorry to have to tell you old
man that ive come to the conclusion
that you and i cant work together after
all said allen

   is this a joke jimmie 

    no  its deadly earnest it isnt that
im scared of the combine but i cant
afford to antagonize a lot of people in
highburg by standing in with you-
burke among them

   up to now answered leigh  id
have smashed the man who said in my
hearing that jimmie allen was a coward
but id let him go on talking now

   think what you like of me came
back  but my minds made up

  are you going it alone then

   i cant quite tell what im going to
do maybe i shall ask our people to
take me out of the district altogether
maybe ill resign and billy be warned
by me-cut out the sentinel and dont
try to fight the combine and the people
that its friendly with

  leigh cut the conversation short by
hanging up the receiver

    allen of all men he muttered  ill
lie hanged if i can believe it but ill
see him to-morrow and find out the true
inwardness of his surrender theres
something in this that he hasnt hinted at
trying to scare me off by throwing it
into jimmie are they well we shall
see

  leigh who had an unduly obstinate
chin unconsciously protruded that feature
at the burke interview then he tele-
phoned to staynes to send a man to help
him over the evening allens deser-
tion having upset his plan of campaign
staynes sent him bryant who had a repu-
tation as a hustler together the two
reporters got a tidy budget of news al-
though at a couple of station-houses the
blotters were grudgingly opened by the
gruff desk sergeants at some of the

gathering places of burkes associates-
centers of political news-leighs recep-
tion was to put it mildly cheerless the
leaven of the combine was evidently at
work

  when he reached the office again bry-
ant handed him a note that had come by
a messenger it was from allen and as
leigh read it he chuckled and slapped his
knee

    bryant said he  please take carbon
copies of what you have and let me have
them and you can quit when youve got
through with your copy we wont try
to cover the district again to-night

  at eleven-thirty came another messen-
ger from allen bearing a bulky envelope
and receiving in exchange one from
leigh- when at midnight one of the
sentinel boys came for copy he took back
with him a note for staynes marked
 strictly personal

  now the highburg morning news-
paper men were on duty until three am
at which hour they gave the  good-
night  signal over the telephone to their
respective offices

  three-quarters of an hour before
leigh laid down his cigar  i dont
quite like to do it he said to himself
 but one has to fight the devil with fire
i suppose

  he rang up the sentinel he must talk
to mr staynes personally and in a hurry
staynes came quickly and in a voice that
trembled with apparent excitement leigh
gave him a brief but sufficient bit of ex-
clusive news of a sensational sort

   it was to the effect that the two-year
old child of henry f dobson one of the
most prominent and wealthy men of high-
burg had been kidnaped from out of the
dobson mansion on the upper part of
arlington avenue on the outskirts of the
borough

   the child slept in a large nursery on
one corner of which was a bed occupied
by the nurse some time after midnight
the nurse was awakened by a draft of air
blowing on her lace she found that the
window of the nursery was open and that
the childs bed was empty

   a ladder leaning against the side of the
house showed how the kidnapers had
gained access to the room the extensive
grounds that surrounded the house fur-
nished ample cover for the movements of


the railroad mans magazine

the daring person who had stolen the
child

  one of the mysteries of the case was
that three or four dogs that were let loose
in the grounds at night had given no
warning of the presence of the kidnapers
when mrs dobson was notified of her
loss-she became insensible and a physi-
cian who was called declared her to be
in a critical condition

  the subsequent confusion was respon-
sible for the police not being -promptly
notified coming on top of the other kid-
naping affair of two days before it seemed
as if a daring and organized gang of child
stealers was operating in highburg

  exclusive asked staynes over the
wire as leigh finished

   thats what i said was the reply
 and i think ill give you  good-night 

  leigh hung up the receiver and stood
looking at the telephone doubtfully

   i dont know he said to himself as
he shook his head  but i suppose it was
called for yet-

  he turned out the lights and left

       chapter viii
       blocking the game

that same morning every one of the
newspapers represented by the
members of the combine published the
alleged kidnaping in one or two cases
the night city editors had added such
additional sensational touches as their
overheated midnight imaginations had
prompted

  neither the sentinel nor allens paper
had a solitary line about the affair all
of the martport evening sheets in com-
menting on the story as a rank fake ex-
plained that no such person as henry f
dobson lived in highburg and that the
scene of the alleged kidnaping was in
reality a soap-factory

  allen dropped in at the seventeenth
district court at about noon

   you see billy he said to leigh  as

i	couldnt explain at length in my note
one part of the plan of the combine to
shut out an anticombine man was to have
the telephone  centrals  tip us off when
the former was phoning to his office and
they connect us with the wire that he was
using

   consequently we only had to listen
and take notes of what he was saying in
order to make it nearly impossible for
him to  scoop  us we were always pret-
ty well posted by headquarters and our
friends on the early news of the district
and the only chance that the other chap
had of twisting our tails was to watch
out for the happenings that we were like-
ly to miss late at night being busy with
flushes and full hands

   of course the gang knew that i
would tell you all this but that alone
wouldnt have done much good to either
of us central would have gone on con-
necting your wire with theirs you would
not have been able to prove it and your
phone would in consequence have been
practically useless

   so your object then was for the
sentinel to get positive evidence that a
leak was taking place with the conni-
vance of a telephone operator 

   precisely and that too was why i
kept away from your office last night and
made suggestions by note as to how you
should work the thing i wanted you
and staynes to be able to swear that only
you two had engineered the test of cen-
trals probity

   and that too is why you so cruelly
severed your connection with me over the
phone said leigh with a grin he
frowned a trifle  it was justifiable i
suppose he said haltingly  but to tell
the truth allen i didnt like to do it
im naturally not a very fluent liar and
it was certainly a bit of tall lying you
must confess

  tut tut cried the big reporter
 it was merely a diplomatic assertion
spiced with necessary reservation the
end always shakes hands with the means
when the scrap between fact and fiction is
over

   but why did you want me to send a
copy of my news to your house instead of
coming to the office for it 

   i havent the slightest doubt that your
incoming and outgoing was the object of
much interest last evening replied al-
len  if then  had visited you after
telephoning my irrevocable determination
not to have anything more to do with you
the sincerity of my declaration might have
been doubted by some of my late asso-
nates
breaking the combine



  leighs eyes twinkled  how are you
going to square yourself when they find
out how theyve been done by you

   i shall explain that you have exer-
cised undue influence over me was the
reply  and if thati doesnt satisfy them
ill call their attention to the fact that its
none of their business

  to be beaten by the sentinel and clar-
ion over the burke scandal was bad
enough but the dobson kidnaping fake
emphasized the need of drastic remedial
action

  the interview with burke obtained by
leigh was as written by the latter
 tabascoesque as allen put it worst
of all there had begun to arise a public
murmur that the sentinel and the record
were the only papers that had sufficient
pluck to tackle the rotten politics of
highburg

  the emphatic word went forth that
combine or  combine such happenings
as had characterized the past two days of
highburgs news couldnt and wouldnt
be tolerated-that the next exclusive
piece of news would be equivalent to the
dismissal of everybody concerned there-
with

  the combine took the rebuke scorn-
fully and sullenly burke was informed
that afternoon the highburg boss had a
talk with one of the biggest men of the
party and the big man who was very
corpulent and had elephantine ears that
readily lent themselves to the purposes of
the cartoonist- called at the offices of the
morning newspapers who politically
were affiliated with him and his he
wanted to know if it were true that they
 was going to give the foot to some of
them highburg boys jus because the boys
hadnt thrown it good an heavy into
burke

  and he wanted to know if there was
 anything doin-any hedging or fence-
straddling behind it all see and
 never mind who he got it from-it come
to him as straight as he wanted it an
of course they could do as they bloody-
well pleased but if they was goin to
fall in behind the sentinel muckrcart he
wanted to have it aforehand an while
he didnt give a so forth and so  what
they was goin to do the party wasnt
goin to be played for a fool 

  when tiie combine-breakers met again

that evening they had the air of those who
know that real work lies before them

   the overture being over the play is
about to begin said allen

  leigh nodded  yes weve got busy
times ahead those fellows will stick us
mostly  station-house stories in other
directions i think we can hold our own
or nearly so but when it conies to the
station-houses i confess that im a bit
puzzled as to how to act

   youre right billy admitted allen
 the same thing has occurred to me i
too dont quite see how we can get next
in this direction

  leigh mused  the only thing that
we can do for the present is to wait de-
velopments if we find that were being
studiously thrown down by our friends
in uniform why but one way remains

   the same being 

  usually jimmie one catches more
flies with sugar than vinegar in the first
instance well try the saccharine treat-
ment if that fails well have to turn 
the sour

  excellent but how

   did you ever yet know of a copper
who hadnt a motli-hole or two in his rec-
ord through which you could prod him
with a pencil and make him squeal  
the light of understanding spread over
allens countenance

   true he said  if i hadnt been
in the combine  wouldnt have been put
next to the ways of the gents in question
 and i too have some similar notes
in the neighborhood of my cuffs replied
leigh  altogether i think that were
pretty well heeled for whatever sort of
game we may run up against

  the earlier part of the evening passed
without incident except that at the quar
ters of the franchise club leigh was re-
fused admission  the plea that an ex-
ecutive meeting of the members was in
progress

  burke was president of the organiza-
tion which politically was the most
prominent of its kind in highburg and
leigh felt that something was brewing
that was being kept from him purposely

  he determined to find out just what it
was therefore after telephoning to al-
len he began to patrol the sidewalk op-
posite the clubhouse keeping in the shad-
ows of the trees and an arc-light the
	the railroad mans magazine

meeting being over he saw halstead and
jennison leave with others which con-
firmed his suspicions he observed one
brone-a small rotund german the pro-
prietor of a saloon

  once upon a time a man with a pull
who also owned a saloon tried to have
brone enjoined from maintaining a nui-
sance  for the man with a pull desired to
monopolize local patronage later his
rival failed to close brones place and
rightly or wrongly the little german at-
tributed the defeat of his foe to leigh
and leigh alone  for leigh had made a
funny story of the affair so he took
occasion to try and prove his gratitude in
many and divers ways

  the reporter remembering all this
followed his man until the latter turned
into a side-street  hallo brone  he
cried  how goes it 

   meester leigh responded brone
his plump shining little face crimsoning
with pleasure  ach hi mint how i am
pleased you to see come my place in
we trink glass of beer oh yes lay-
ing a restraining hand on the others coat-
sleeve  you come must

  leigh nodded  the saloon was reached 
nobody else was there except the tailor
who lived next door and who was asleep
on a chair in a corner mrs brone the
counterpart of her husband in face and
figure greeted leigh heartily

  vos you the meeting at to-night
asked brone after some general chat
leigh had been leading up to the ques-
tion

  	no replied the reporter  t couldnt
get up which was true  adding with a
yawn anything interesting

   eenteresting  cried brone  i pet
vou  some of the newspaper poys vos
dere i see em deyll put lots der pa-
pers in

   perhaps so replied leigh  but
what was it all about he half rose as
if to go

   seet down insisted his host  thees
is fine peece news you vait lena more
beer  fine news yes 

  with very little prompting brone then
told how the meeting was really of a semi-
executive sort-at all events the door-
keepers had instructions to bar all per-
sons but members and  those invited
leigh smiled to himself at this know-

ing the wherefore of the order that a
home rule association had been organ-
ized to the end of checking  attempts at
meddlesome interference on the part of
the legislature in regard to matters that
had to do with local interests which in-
terests were best administered by persons
conversant with them   that several of
the martport party leaders were present
and made speeches denunciatory of the
attack on burke  and that finally a reso-
lution had been passed to the effect that
a bill be introduced at an early date by
one of the highburg assemblymen call-
ing for an investigation of the motives
and certain of the official methods of the
inaugurators of the board of trade move-
ment

  leigh took but few notes he had the
tenacious memory of the trained reporter
and he excused himself as soon as pos-
sible after wringing brone dry then
he hastened to tlie office where he found
allen awaiting him

  allen looked a trifle worried  i feel
it in my bones he said -that theres
something doing to-night that weve been
shut out of

   why  asked leigh

  the other shrugged his shoulders help-
lessly  i dont know why i feel it in
my bones

  your bones didnt fib jimmie re-
plied leigh and he told him of the meet-
ing of the franchise club

   that explains said allen  i ran
up against jennison about half an hour
ago and his little green eyes looked mis-
chief as i passed  good night said i

 good night said he  and pleasant
dreams to you and then he grinned evi-
dently he was reveling in the thought of
how joyous wed feel when we read the
combines  scoop  to-morrow

   get anything out of the district  
asked leigh

  allen handed over the scant notes that
represented his evenings labor and both
men then fell to work leigh finished
first

   eleven oclock he said glancing at
his watch  senator clives is stopping
at the bay view house  he goes to bed
early as i know and so i feel pretty sure
that ill run him to earth there ill also
see moriarty the board of trade presi-
dent and jimmie if you dont mind
breaking the combine



breaking up the beauty sleep of halpin
the legal adviser to the board of trade
and one or two others who are interested
in the matter well put a sting in the tail
of this story thatll make the combine look
pale

  both reporters were lucky in meeting
the men -they sought

  at about one oclock in the morning
they went to a near-by restaurant on
the way thither they met burke  any-
thing to tell us  leigh asked blandly of
the politician

   nothing to tell you was the reply

   my bones arent quite easy yet said
allen as they were on the way back to the
office

   i think wed better make a tour of the
rounds once more said leigh

  allen consulted his watch  its rather
late for that anyhow lets ask  cen-
tral  if anybody has rung us up

  somebody had but  central  didnt
know who the men looked at each other
vexedly

   ill try the sentinel office and police
headquarters said leigh the calls
proved fruitless however  now let me
see if it was the clarion people remarked
allen holding out his hand for the re-
ceiver

  just then came the sound of heavy foot-
steps on the stairs outside

   a late visitor muttered leigh

  allen threw open the office door
there stood ahearne

  hallo pat cried leigh  glad
to see you come in you know mr
allen 

   oi do sor replied the officer  an
yez hev a snug place uv it here

   yes said leigh  and welcome for
a friend-like yourself

   how are things pat asked leigh

   purty an well but av either uv yez
been up to the fifth precinct to-night

  allen glanced at leigh as much as to
say  i told you so

   mr allen has replied leigh

   did he get the story about  father
poldinski thin

  no said allen what was it

  oi thought yez was out uv it an so
oi called yez up but didnt get yez so
passing here on me way home sez oi
oid hate fr th boys to be bate on so

illigant a chunk uv news an up oi

 so said leigh what hap-
pened 

   well yez know that th re-lay-shuns
av father poldinski th good man an
his gintle payrishners hev bin tsthrained
for many a month so tnight a whole
lot uv bleatin polacks comes to th fifth
jabberin that th  father  had licked a
couple uv hunder uv um tremenjus an
had kicked a thousan into th street

   an in the midst uv it all with ma-
loney-he was disk sergeant-tryin to
make some av them talk sinse bang an
intirs th  father  himself

   he was cross oh my but whin th
flock seen its shephird thus it didnt sthop
to wish maloney good night but just scat-
thered-payin no attenshun to where an
how an why it was goin the  father 
was blockin th dure but th windies was
handy-both back an front-an they was
took advantage uv in a way demoralizin
to th frames an th glass uv um

   some uv the fleein ones skipped up
th stairs ladin to th quarters uv the
resarves many uv whom was slapin

mullins who was awoke by a large po-
lack wid black whiskers steppin on his
face  the furriners is risen byes  he
blathers  an wid that there was swing-
ing uv niglit-sticks an drawin uv guns
an a scene of cruel war

   what time did it take place

   about nine oclock oi should judge
rawlins got excused for a half-hour at
eight oclock and on his way back to th
station he noticed bunches uv distrissed
polacks on th way there th throuble
began not long afther he had reported
agin

  and maloney was at the desk
said leigh

   yis

   so you thought that we might slip up
on this story and looked us up did you 
went on leigh looking at the big irish-
man with friendly eves

  ahearne smiled in affirmation  ma-
loney is a burke man ye know

   i sliant forget this pat said leigh

   nor i added allen

   its a fight to the death now said
leigh
the railroad mans
b r a in teasers

 a few hard nuts of the early spring variety to loosen
 up the mental machinery of our mathematicians

       ld haseltine of richmond indiana contributes the following

        	a siding holds three cuts or sixty cars an engineer hauling a train
        of twenty cars conies to this siding and wishes to take the middle twenty
        cars and place the twenty cars he is hauling in the place of the twenty cars
        he takes out leaving the end sections in the same position he found them

            the engine can only handle twenty cars at a time no drop staking
        or roping to be done

           can this be done if so show how many moves

            w a hickey of chicago obliges us with the following

            given two intersecting railroad lines a west-bound and north-bound
        train each four hundred and forty feet long each train starts at the same
        time from a point one hundred miles from the intersection the north-
        bound train runs at a speed of fortv-cight miles per hour at what speed
        must the west-bound train run to reach and clear the crossing at the
        moment that the locomotive of the north-bound train touches that point

             the answer to these puzzles will appear in our may issue

 answer to march puzzle

            i the car does not slide from under smith while he is in the air
        he does alight in the same spot because smith and everything else car-
        ried by the train partakes of its progressive motion he is traveling
        thirty miles an hour when he made the jump and thirty miles an hour when
        lie completes it

             the only distance which he could alight behind the take off -
        would be what the wind kicked up by thirty miles an hour would have
        blown him if he jumped straight not more than two or three inches

             no

             if he performed his stunt in the aisle of an enclosed passenger-
        coacli he would return absolutely to the same spot


on the editorial carpet

      side-talks with the man who sits in the cab of
      the magazine and is commonly called an editor

the monorail is all very well as a valu-
able asset of the sunday newspaper
and maybe when theyre through tinkering
around a bit theyll get something that might
be useful but for ourselves we like to
feel all the ten wheels of our engine spanning
the standard gage track and whirling along
without depending on any spinning top to
keep us right side up

  thats why we dont try any freak motive
power or rolling stock in the make-up of our
monthly train we know what our readers
want and the only difference month by-
month is caused by the effort to get a higher
polish on the coach-trimmings of a higher
steam-pressure in the gage

  of course improvements are all right
and we dont intend to miss any chances in
that direction blit the things that we put on
must have passed all the safety-appliance
tests ever formulated by a government of
critical readers it is through this method
that we are able month by month to promise
for the following month a magazine keyed
to as high or higher pitch as the one being
turned out

  in fact for may we have had to get a
new steam-indicator put in the cab for we
couldnt register the pressure without bust-
ing the old one this is particularly true in
the matter of fiction

  we dont think we ever had quite such a
collection of authors in one issue as we shall
have in the may number j r stafford
frank condon robert t creel robert f
hoffmann f h richardson and augustus
wittfeld make a train-crew that any fast-
flying limited could be proud of

  mr staffords story is about a refreshing
irishman whose cool impudence is as uncon-
scious as his natural capability is great mr
hoffmanns story will probably be called
 bill daidys chapter and youll agree that
it is one of the most unusual chapters ever
written by a railroad man in its way it is
as refreshing as mr staffords irishman

  mr wittfeld is as funny as ever which is
saying something hard to believe

  besides these stories we have others equal-
ly good but we fear to mention more be-
cause if in the excitement of making up the

train one or two cars got switched we dont
like to feel responsible for too many disap-
pointments

  in the special articles we have the very
sad announcement to make that the may
number will see brought to a close the
evolution of almost by horace herr we
consider this sketch to have been a distinct
 find

  there is in newspaper parlance a much-
abused phrase namely  human interest
if the writers of some of these human in-
terest stories would read  the evolution
of almost we think they would quit out of
shame

  we dont remember reading in a long time
of so distinctly human and lovable a charac-
ter as  almost he is the male mrs wiggs
and we all feel better in a very real sense of
the word for having made his acquaintance
he is an addition to railroad literature

  other features among the special articles
for the may number will be number six of
the  letters of an old railroad man and
his son a series that has taken particularly
well the always delightful observations
of a country station-agent  no  of mr
rogerss articles on the shops entitled  rail-
road machines commercial traveler yarns
told in the smoker old-timer tales and
maybe an instructive article on the story of
railroad trade-marks

  we have in mind several other fine high-
class pieces of equipment but we dont want
to put  so much fuel here that well have
to spend the rest of the month hauling out
the clinkers so we guess well take the high-
ball and get out of town

  clear track for may

at

a million miles

nphe lake shore and michigan southern
-t- mail-train no  and extra coal-train
no  were in rear-end collision at a point
fourteen miles west of toledo on january
 a brakeman edward mckinley of to-
ledo was killed and ten or more of the
two train crews were injured the mail-
train with engineer a g reynolds and

r


the railroad mans magazine

fireman m l curtice in the engine over-
took and crushed the caboose and two rear
cars of the freight derailing and partially
overturning the engine of the mail-train
according to reports received

  the cause of the wreck as given by these
reports was the failure of mr reynolds to
observe soon enough a signal set against
the mail while he was busy trying to reseat
an injector check-valve on the firemans side
of the engine which had stuck while open

  the need of this repair was urgent it
was a fast and heavy train the water was
rapidly lowering in the boiler and blowing-
back into the tank

  this is by no means the first time that an
engineers natural anxiety for the proper
working of the injectors upon which his
own life and the lives of others largely
depend while running fast has led to disas-
ter and greatly as it is to be hoped this
will not be the last time that such a thing
will happen

  we have no intention of entering upon a
discussion of the merits or demerits of this
occurrence we are quite willing to leave
that to the able disciplinarians and arm-chair
philosophers whose duty or vagrant incli-
nations lead them to do it so willingly at
the same time we would request these
lay-philosophers to be careful in pitting their
knowledge of the chances and complex du-
ties of an engineer against that of the engi-
neer himself

  what we have chiefly in mind is the broad
human aspect of this unfortunate event and
the unusual circumstances which attended
it

 in the railroad mans magazine for
september  we printed a story under
the title a modern mazeppa there is in
that story of wreck and anguish a paragraph
that met a quick response in the hearts of
experienced railroad men we have reason
to believe that it carried well its message
of finality fellowship and implied conso-
lation to many of our readers who are best
able to appreciate its healing and sober
truth

  just now it seems to epitomize the thing
we wish to say and to send forth anew a
human note broad and deep enough to meet
the need of almost any sorrow that through
mishap may come to a railroad man and his
family

  the paragraph supposedly spoken by a
wounded engineer is as follows

   you see he continued when he had re-
gained control of himself there is so much
to remember and to do in most of the af-
fairs of life mistakes can be corrected-a
little lapse of thought a little extra weari-
ness a little error of judgment a little thing

undone but with us it is final and complete
there is  recall  sufficient extenuation

  that is it there is no recall for the ap-
parently little thing undone as in the com-
mon daily derelictions of life instead
there are sometimes the irreparable loss of
life the maiming and bruising of crews and
as in the accident west of toledo the added
pathos of a lifetimes splendid work marred
by one fell stroke at its close

  picture a man courageous kindly soft-
voiced instinctively a gentleman-in short
the highest type of locomotive engineer-in
whose mind the welfare of his fellow work-
ers and the passengers entrusted to hig care
are ever uppermost

  for forty-one years two and one-half
years of which are spent in firing he runs
consecutively at the head of his train build-
ing up a well-nigh perfect record and look-
ing ahead to that half-dreaded yet much de-
sired honorable retirement to which every
engineer now aspires

  at the end of this more than average span
of a working life filled with tense activities
calling out the utmost from every faculty
he has arrived with hair long since whi-
tened hy the strain at the seventy-year mile-
post of his life

  if we assume that he has run his trip of
say one hundred miles a day for only two
out of each three days that have gone with
the years he will have run a million miles
or more through that which seems to the
wayfaring man a fierce and menacing wilder-
ness of sights and sounds forty times the
distance around the earth at the equator
one hundred and twenty-five times the dis-
tance through it there one ninety fifth of
the distance from earth to sun 

  and if for somewhat more than twenty
years of this time he has pulled a passenger-
train he will have led some million or so
f humans upon their hurrying ways safely
through that wilderness of menacing sights
and sounds not one in a thousand of whom
has ever so much as seen him much less
touched his hand or acknowledged him a
leader among men

  this in effect is the almost matchless
record of a g reynolds engineer of the
mail up to january  when he stood in the
toledo station just before starting on his run
home to elkhart indiana with his pension
papers in his pocket retiring him for age
at the end of this particular run

  less than fifteen miles out of toledo
his engine was ditched there was death and
suffering for his fellows and himself his
spotless record was gone like a breath of
vapor blown from his cab-window and his
well-earned retirement upon pension was in
doubt
on the editorial carpet	k

  unnumbered generations of men have
read the story of leadership of courage of
momentary human weakness overmastered
by unflagging zeal for duty which sustained
moses through forty years of striving
through the wilderness toward canaan

  they have read of the one thing undone-
the one failure to observe the detail of the
spoken law when common human needs
were sorely pressing

   and now that time has truthfully revealed
the great iaw-giver in the long perspective
of its passing the thing that lives in the big
human consciousness is the aching gripping
tragedy of the indomitable leader ripe in
years and honor trudging courageously to
the mountain-top of his ambition only to
look over into the land of promise which
he might not enter

   something of this feeling we believe will
attach to the consideration of the deplorable
accident in point especially among those
who best understand the possibility of such
happenings in the ordinary course

   at the time of this writing there is some
doubt being expressed as to the eligibility of
an engineer to pension for age under the
circumstances above recited there is how-
ever an additional fact which may be con-
strued in favor of mr reynolds

   it is that he had reached the age-limit of
seventy years on the day before the accident
and was it is said finishing out the month of
january with one last return run to his home
station at his own request and of course
with the consent of his superior in authority

   all in all therefore we believe we express
the sentiment of many railroad men and
others in hoping that long before this ap-
pears in print this veteran engineer who was
treated so shabbily by fate in the very last
hours of his great work may have been
honorably enrolled among the pensioned vet-
erans and that his hurts of body and
thought may with those of the others who
likewise suffer be well upon the way of
healing

   mothers signal

albert cain an old reader of this

	magazine has sent us from his home
in cochran indiana the words of the fol-
lowing poem  mothers signal which is
commemorative of john little who lost his
life in a wreck at cochran july   
the b and o s w

john little was an engineer

careful skilful without fear

a widowed mother was his care
and everything he had to share
with her was shared in equal part

for john loved her with all his heart

each day john littles train went through
his  mothers signal little blew

and all our town this signal knew

and well we learned to love it too

his train was always run  time

his love for mother was sublime

and whether passing east or west
he signaled her whom he loved best

 at first this signal loud and shrill

pierced every one with noisesome thrill

but after while our whole town knew

what meant the signal little blew

and loved to hear his engines cry
each day as littles train flew by

so reglar littles train went long

your watch with it could not be wrong

and thus for years this engineer

careful skilful without fear

went running through now east then west-
on all the road he was the best-

and when his mothers town he passed

john little blew his loyal blast

and all the town as he flew by

rejoiced to hear his engine cry
his signal sweet to mothers ear

and more we loved it year by year

twas music sweet to evry ear

and sweeter it grew evry year-

because it told of filial love

most certain of reward above

at last there came a fatal day

and littles spirit passed away

and nevermore within her town
is littles mothers signal blown

on open switch a freight-train lay

and johns train had the right of way
whose fault not his but in a flash
there came an awful-awful crash
and wreck such as is seldom known-

and noble littles soul had flown

there underneath his engine bound

john littles body crushed was found

the whistle-valve his hand held fast

one moment more as he flew past

his mothers home his signal-call

would have cheered her and thrilled us all

and littles mother scarce a mile

away was waiting with a smile

to hear her boy blow her his love

when littles spirit soared above

his face glowed with a heavenly light

but littles soul had taken flight

now nevermore that signal will
echoes wake from hill to hill

but lord  our god  father in heaven 

if he had sins be they forgiven 

for faithfulness like his-and love-

must surely find reward above

bouquets and kicks

although we are regularly running
 under two hundred pounds working
pressure we like to occasionally ease up and
gather in the kind and unkind words with
which our readers are wont to strew our

 and mocked al god in your hellish pride
 youve paid full fare so i carry you through
 for ii is only right that you get your due
 for every laborer is worth his hire

 so i land you safe in my lake of fire

 w here my fiery imps will torment you for-
    ever

 and all in vain you will sigh for a savior
 then tom awoke with an awful cry

 his clothes soaked wet and his hair stand-
    ing high

 and he prayed as he had never prayed before
 to be saved from hell and the devils power
 and his crying and praying was not in vain
 for he never more rode on the hell-bound
 train

 tell me not

 teli me not in box-car numbers
 life is but an empty dream

 if youre working for a railroad

 oh how happy life must seem

 life is business on a railroad

 where you have to do things right

 do just what the yardmaster tells you
    labor hard from morn till night

 lives of railroad men remind us
    we must never be sublime

 but when going leave behind us
    garnishes upon our time

 garnishes which perhaps some other
    wandering on this stormy main-

 some forlorn and wayward brother-
    seeing shall pass  again

 when our working days are over

 and our harvest days are spent

 with our shoes all worn and dusty
    with our backs all tired and bent

 we shall near the gates of heaven

    but inside well never get

 for st peter there will tell us

     weve  railroad men here yet

   lifes railway to heaven

 by charlie d tillman

 copyrighted  by charlie d tillman

 life is like a mountain railroad

 with an engineer thats brave

 we must make the run successful
    from the cradle to the grave

 watch the curves the fills the tunnels
     never falter never quail

 keep your hand upon the throttle

 and your eye upon the rail

 chorus

 blessed savior thou wilt guide us
    till we reach that blissful shore

 where the angels wait to join us

 in thy praise forevermore

  you will roll up grades of trial

  you will cross the bridge of strife

  see that christ is your conductor

  on this lightning train of life

  always mindful of obstruction

  do your duty never fail

  keep your hand upon the throttle

  and your eye upon the rail

  repeat chorus

  you will always find obstructions

  look for storms of wind and rain

  on a fill or curve or trestle

  they will almost ditch your train

  put your trust alone in jesus

  never falter never fail

  keep your hand upon the throttle

  and your eye upon the rail

  repeat chorus

  as you roll across the trestle

  spanning deaths dark swelling tide

  you behold the union depot

into which your train will glide

  there youll meet the superintendent
  god the father-god the son

  with the hearty joyous plaudit

   weary pilgrim welcome home 

  repeat chorus

  we were none of us thinking of danger

  as the train sped  in the night

  till the flames from a burning forest
  made the passengers wild with fright

  then a tiny maid near a window with a
      smile said

  theres nothing to fear

im sure t-iat  harm will befall you-

  my dads the engineer

  retrain

 daddys  the engine dont be afraid

  daddy knows what he is doing said the
      little maid

   well soon be out of danger dont you ever
       fear

  every one is safe because my dads the
      engineer

  with the sparks falling closely about us
  through the flames we sped  so fast

  and the brave little maids father

  brought us through the danger all safe at
      last

  and the proud sweet face of his lassie

and the words of the calm little dear

  will live iti my memry forever-

greenhouses etc where correct heating and ventilation are an absolute necessity
ideal boilers and american radiators are made in such small sizes yet
with equal completeness that they are now put into thousands of cottages houses

by cutting down the fuel bills and absence of repairs while their cleanliness halves
the housework and saves much wear on carpets and furnishings

do not wait until you build that new house which you may have in mind see that your present

home is warmed as you know it should be
and it will rent for   to  more or
sell quickly at a higher price when you

        dust into
        gold dollars

   

 a ijittle giant cleaner should pay for itself
 in less than two months out of the profits of the
 business after paying help and all expenses

          it is capable of earning  to  clear
          profit a month and we cannot see where there is
          a possible chance for anyone that buys a machine to
          fail to make big money but every reason why they
          should make thousands of dollars

give us a chance to help you

       you can make  to  a year on each machine it advertises itself

       and orders for work come pouring in so you should be busy all the time

           the little giant house cleaner is proving one of the greatest money-makers ever
        put on the market if you are willing to hustle you can easily make  to  a year
        on each machine you own make a start to-day and you will never regret it as soon as
        you earn money enough and have one machine paid for buy another hire other men and
        let them make  or  a day for you getting one of these machines and hiring a
        man to run it beats working for a living to a standstill be johnny on the spot
        with a machine and get the cream of the business if you can get a number of these
        machines workingthey should make you rich we believe there never has been a
        machine placed on the market that has so pleased everybody met with such immediate
        success and made so much money as the house cleaning machine

a perfect wonder

             the little giant reaches every crack corner and
         crevice of the floor the cracks in the wall the ceiling
         and mouldings it cleans and renovates bedding com-
         forts blankets mattresses and pillows the cracks or
         crevices in wooden and iron beds even the dust fuzz and
         other accumulation in tightly coiled woven-wire springs

              it consists of a powerful gasoline engine a double
          acting suction air pump a vacuum condenser cold water
          tank electric spark battery vacuum gauge high-pressure
          suction hose observation glass and cleaning tools-all
          properly connected so as to work in unison and give the
          desired results the whole is erected on a substantial
          four-wheel wagon to be drawn by hand so that it can be
          moved from place to place

   nothing to compare with it

  there are several small machines on the market for home
use to be worked either by hand or a small water or electric
motor but they have never been a success because they do
not have power enough to clean with although they will
draw the top dust from the room the little giant
cleaner does the same work in the same way as the large
machines costing from  to  each it has the
same size hose

  we have seen it pull out pail after pail of dirt from
houses-dirt that was impossible to remove completely by
the ordinary means of beating etc when it is working
on the streets the dirt and filth pouring through the obser-
vation glass attracts a crowd of people that look with
wonder they would not believe it possible

   our liberal offer -pay for it out of your profits

      we want you to investigate this exceptional opportunity we do not believe
      there is any business where so small an investment will bring such wonderful returns
      because right here in toledo we have proved this by our own actual experience
      we have such implicit confidence in the wonderful money-making powers of tho little
      giant llouae cleaner-that we will ship one to any live man who is honest and
      willing to work on  day trial-upon such liberal terms that it is next to impos-
      sible to lose we will even go further and allow you to pay for it in liihtallnicnt
      and in such a way that your profit should easily tako caro of your payments

  in our illustrated book we give full particulars as to how to organize your business
  solicit orders what to charge for tho work and how to turn every minute of vour tine iuto
  money we will send it to you free every ambitious man who lias any get-up in
  him should write at once for this book a postage stamp will bring it to you and it
  will show you how you can become independent and ono of tho prosperous men

new iver johnson

 safety automatic revolver

the famous
 home defender
whose safety feature
is an inbuilt integral
part of its mechanism has
been brought to the highest
perfection yet achieved in a
revolver

  in this latest model of the
famous hammer tlie hammer
revolver improvements have
been made which add immeasur-
ably to smoothness of action
certainty of fire and durability
of mechanism in a small arm

  every spring in the new iver
johnson revolver is made of fin-
est piano wire drawn tempered
replacing the old hat springs
coil springs are insisted upon by
the united states government in
its rifles wherever possible note
these coil springs in the ghost
picture above

  the flat or kick spring of
old type revolvers is always at
greatest tension at one point and
after long use fatigue attacks the
metal at that point and the spring
weakens or breaks down

  in the coil springs of the iver

johnson revolver tension is sus-
tained equally throughout every
point of the coil there is no
one point to weaken under use
and finally break down-and leave
you defenseless in a moment
when possibly life depends upon
action it is positive trust-
worthy and practically good for
the life of the revolver itself

  the iver johnson is the first
and only revolver equipped with
this type of spring at every pos-
sible point it is positively the
highest type of small arm ever
made and while fitted to work
as smooth as velvetthe action of
the iver johnson is simple strong
and dependable for a lifetime

  the safety action of the iver
johnson revolver is as impossible
to improve upon as it is impossi-
ble to imitate and has therefore

undergone no
change it is
the same safe
and sound
hammer the

hammer it safeguards you
from accident without your hav-
ing to remember any directions
how to use to push a slide or
press a button when you want to
shoot-say in an emergency it
is always ready to shoot in-
stantly accurately and hard

  the accurate splendid shoot-
ing qualities and high penetration
of the iver johnson are unsur-
passed because the barrel drop
forged from the finest steel made
for the purpose is rifled as accu-
rately as in revolvers that cost
several times as much the
bullet flies fast and true the iver
johnson is in a class all its own

features of our revolvers including the new models

 i won over  per cent of all the blue ribbons that were
 offered during  and  the last season that i

              the elite watch for critical users an acctcrate timer
              jewelled with seven jewels and beautifully cased

the ingersoll-trenton solves the watch-problem for the
man who wants to be told the exact time by a handsome and
honestly-built watch which he can buy at a moderate price

every ingersoll-trenton watch is enclosed in an
original ingersoll-trenton case and time-tested at
the factory before shipment watch case and time-
keeping-all three-are guaranteed by the same
maker this fact is of the utmost importance
to the buyer and is the only instance oi the kind
in the history of watchmaking

the ingersoll-trenton rivals in accuracy any
other high-grade watch it is sold by  re-
sponsible jewelers at a factory-fixed price which
pleases the purchaser and puzzles other watch-
makers who make their product in smaller quan-
tities employ expensive and sometimes un-
scrupulous selling-methods and are obliged there-
by to make the watch-buyer pay unnecessary and
fictitious prices

here are the ingersoll-trenton prices

the widely-known	models

the famous ingersoll dollar watch together with the other ingersoll models at
 and  has turned the watch-world upside-down and made millions of people
carry watches who never carried them before more than seventeen millions of
these watches have been sold twelve thousand are now being sold every day
in the week  dealers sell them

    ingersoll watches tick everywhere-tick truly and tell time ask any-
    where for an ingersoll the dealer will know exactly what you mean

      we have published a little book bound in an embossed cover it contains five facts worth five
      dollars to anyone who is ever going to buy another watch the title of this book is how to judge
