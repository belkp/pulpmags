w youre that man heres something
i m that will interest you

          not a magic formula-not a get-
rich-quick scheme-but something more
substantial more practical

of course you yourself need something
more than just the ambition to be an ac-
countant youve got to pay the price--be
willing to study earnestly thoroughly

still wouldnt it be worth your while to
sacrifice some of your leisure in favor of
interesting home study-over a compara-
tively brief period in your life always pro-
vided that the rewards were good-a salary
of  to 

think of the thrill of cashing a good sized
salary check of building a modern home of
cruising about town in a new car of swelling
your bank account

many an accountant-who mind you doesnt
have to kill himself with work to afford
them his duties are interesting varied and
of real worth to his employers he has
standing

in a large accounting house under the personal

pose with his aid you studied accounting
principles and solved problems day by day-
easy ones at first-then the more difficult
ones if you could do this-and if you could
turn to him for advice as the problems be-
came complex-soon youd master them all

  thats the training you follow in principle
under the lasalle problem method

  however under lasalle the training is
much broader you learn more than one ac-
countant usually could teach at lasalle
theres a staff of experienced specialists to
guide you you get the benefit of their com-
bined experience

principles right up through accountancy
systems and income tax procedure then

 i

oreillys ceremonial farewell to
india was a magnificent affair all
the maharajahs twenty elephants
were lined up in the square opposite the
palace their restless trunks painted white
and vermillion like sinuous barber poles
their howdahs glittering in the burning
glare of the tropical sun

  perched aboard the largest bull of the
twenty the one with the gold-and-dia-
mond studded tusks was terrence
oreilly himself his massive frame
hunched to fit in among the plush and
spangles of a howdah designed for lesser
men than an ex-new york cop

 the resplendent uniform which
oreilly was wearing for the last time
dazzling with more gold braid than a
circus band master was wet with per-
spiration his bright red hair too was
dewy beneath his gold-spiked sun hel-
met

  yet despite the heat he had a funny
cold feeling inside him and a strange
lump in his throat he wondered why he
should feel like this about going home to
become patrolman oreilly of the ninth
precinct again instead of oreilly sahib
marshal of personal safety to his high-
ness vinayak rao bahadur maharajah
of zarapore then he looked off across
the square to where the green-coated
green-turbaned palace guards were
drawn up at attention and his angular
bull-dog jaw worked sidewise

  the guards were firing off a loud and
ragged feu de joie with muskets that had
seen service in the sepoy rebellion the
palace musicians were beating on ancient
drums blowing into squealing wind in-
struments raising awful sounds from
copper trumpets so long that it took three
small boys to hold them off the ground

  the sabers of the maharajahs aides
flashed in salute and the brilliant mosaic
made by the turbans of the watching
crowd bent forward to salaam like
poppies before a breeze the maharajah
emerged to mount the throne beneath the
five golden umbrellas on the palace steps

the horns blared again and the
maharajah began his public good-
byes to oreilly sahib he spoke in urdu
and oreilly did not understand a fifth of
what he was saying but he knew the
content his highness had said the same
thing in english the week before when he
broke the news over a bottle of cham-
pagne

  i cant help myself terry the
maharajah had said the british raj
is clamping down all the war-time regu-
lations and theyve told me to dismiss all
aliens in my service

  i havent forgotten youve saved my
life i never shall and i promised you
that your job was permanent i know
you wouldnt want to give up your
american citzenship though so im
sending you back to new york my
bankers in the states will continue to pay
your salary so you can live like a pen-
sioner if you like

  pensioner my eye oreilly had said
im going back on the force ill be a
sergeant in another year and that brings
all the dough a man like me needs the
pension can go to buying a little house


over in brooklyn just for my old lady

  ill miss you terry the maharajah
had said

  sure and ill miss you too vinnie
oreilly had replied glibly he had said
it to be polite but now as he looked out
on all this pomp and display of a feudal
oriental state he knew it was true

  for all the heat and homesickness of
the gasping nights before the monsoons
broke when he would have given any-
thing for the smell of snow on the wind
from east river the whiff of bacon from
an all-night coffee pot or the scraping
sound of a snow-shovel on a frozen side-
walk-i-for all that he was at this moment
sorry to leave

  he knew that when he got back to the
roar of the subway the routine of the
station house the flash of traffic lights
and the scream of sirens he would be
thinking of this carnival of pomp and
poverty of strange brown and black
faces of whiskers and turbans among the
tumip-like domes and heat and dust of
zarapore

  he would be thinking of the young
maharajah whomhe had saved from the
conspiracy of an ambitious brother of the
chubby brown siibadar of civil police
whom he had taught to play poker and
who had helped him put down a hindu-
moslem riot almost single-handed of the
mad yogi with a tenth avenue accent
who had taken a hand in the game after
the affairof the opium factory in ganeshi
mohans private temple

  well fate had whisked him to india
as bodyguard for a hindu prince and he
could not quarrel with fate now that the
magic carpet was making a return trip 

the horns squealed and howled again
and oreilly climbed down from his
elephant his six-feet-four towered
above the flanking adcs as he marched
forward to the throne for the ceremonial
award of a pugaree a pugaree is like a
turban except that it is narrower and is
one hundred sixty-six feet long to a tur-
bans thirty and is consequently more
complicated to wind

  but when it is awarded by a mahara-
jah it is like a medal for bravery and
carries a rise in pay or a pension with it
so oreilly understood that the matter
of his pension had to be arranged accord-
ing to the customs of zarapore and duti-
fully bent down while two expert tur-
ban-winders removed his helmet and
went to work weaving an intricate struc-
ture of brilliant cloth strips upon his
head

  when he looked up at the maharajah
however he was startled the young
man in all his regalia of satin and jewels
was not the breezy confident young ruler
he had expected to see there was a
haunted haggard look on his handsome
face a strange pallor under his olive-
tinted skin

  whats wrong vinnie oreilly mut-
tered under his breath while the turban-
winders were putting the finishing
touches on the pugaree

  i want to talk to you after the cere-
mony the maharajah murmured in
tense english come and see me in an
hour ill be in my private diggings

  ill be there your highness said
oreilly he beamed as he straightened

up and saluted the thought that there
was still trouble for him to get into be-
fore he left zarapore made him so elated
that he forgot to feel foolish in his new
pugaree returning to the palace after
divesting himself of his uniform his
pugaree and the smell of elephant
oreilly found the maharajah nervously
pacing the thick rugs of his private apart-
ments there was never any formality
about him when he received his ameri-
can friend but there was even less of the
potentate than usual in his manner to-
day he was merely a very worried
young man who had stripped off his tur-
ban and his court clothes and was wear-
ing only a pair of shorts and a deep
frown

  terry im going to ask you do me one
more favor before you leave india said
the maharajah running his nervous fin-
gers through his sleek black hair dont
answer until youve heard the story be-
cause you may not want to do it it may
be dangerous

  thats swell said oreilly grinning
when do i start

  i suppose you know about the fire in
my government laboratories last night
yeah too bad

 and that dr khopri was burned to
death

 was he they didnt tell me that
oreilly shook his head khopri was a
nice fella tough luck

  it wasnt luck terry the maharajah
came over and stared hard at oreilly
with a strange fire burning deep in his
dark eyes it could have been an acci-
dent that all of dr khopris notes and
records were destroyed but that he him-
self should die that he should be there at
such an odd hour of the night-
murder eh oreilly arose and
picked up his malacca stick as though
ready for instant duty who-

  sit down terry its quite a story did
i tell you about the manganese deposits
in the nila hills ten miles from here
not that i remember

  the maharajah passed a silver box of
cigarettes oreilly waved them away
and took a burma cheroot from his
pocket

rpheres no need to tell you terry
said the maharajah holding a
match for oreilly that im devoted to
the british cause in this war even if i
hadnt been educated at oxford id be a
rabid partisan any intelligent man
would

  well when dr khopri told me several
months ago that he had discovered man-
ganese in my state i immediately com-
municated with delhi manganese is a
strategic material you know steel and
armaments and theres never enough
of it

 well delhi sent down a government
mineralogist by the name of henry
fayne i disliked him instantly but that
has nothing to do with the mans ability
i even believed him when he reported
that the supposed manganese deposits
were really a freak-that the nila hills
had been salted by nature thousands
of years ago a shower of meteorites
pelted down on this part of india and
since the fragments are rich in mangan-
ese the soil still shows traces of it he
 remember redheaded terry oreilly the former flat-
 foot who serves a maharajah well oreilly sahib is
 retiring with hindu trumpets blasting and turbans bob-
 bing but his route out of india is by way of havoc

 by l g blochman

author of crisis in calcuttathe magnificent babu
dutt etc

the handcar gathered speed oheilly aimed at it carefully and bred


said but not nearly enough to warrant
mining it

   since fayne sent his report after hed
left zarapore x could not take issue with
him when i showed it to dr khopri
however he disagreed violenty he
pointed out that the manganese in me-
teorites is in its native form that while
some oxidation was certain to occur
over a period of centuries his own pros-
pecting had revealed a uniformity of de-
posits which indicated a deep-seated mass
of both manganite and braunite

  i had-great confidence in dr khopri
and supposed that henry fayne was
merely mistaken i asked dr khopri to
prepare his own report with ore speci-
mens and was seeking some way i might
tactfully reopen the matter then dr
khopris death in the fire which de-
stroyed his records made me change my
mind i no longer consider henry fayne
incompetent what do you think terry

  oreilly whistled fifth column he
suggested

   possibly the maharajah agreed the
germans would certainly try to prevent
the development of new manganese fields
and as much as i detest the nazis i must
admit that they are thorough and far-
reaching in their underground organiza-
tion

   there is another possibility however

i	always suspect my brother in matters of
this kind the intriguing fingers of
prince mahmed are very long and very
active even from his exile in goa

  it is more likely that the germans
have got to him in portuguese india and
that he is merely seeking to exploit the
fields for commercial gains-after he
steals my throne i would rather think
that mr fayne is merely greedy not a
traitor

  where do i come in oreilly asked

tn this way said the maharajah i

  a cant very well go to the political
officer here because mr henderson is a
guileless scholar who would resent my
implication that an official from delhi
might be betraying the interests of his
country

  i no longer have dr khopri and his
records to bear out my suspicions i am
forbidden by treaty from going over the
political officers head and dealing di-
rectly with delhi therefore i am asking
you to go to delhi for me will you
terry

  i wont be much good at explaining
about the magna-about the rocks
oreilly said

  im sending someone with you for
that the maharajah said im sending
professor gurda a science teacher in my
high school here who had heard dr
khopris theories and who will be able
to explain the ore samples im sending
with you

  i want you to see that the professor
and the samples arrive safely at the
mining office and i want you to pretend
that you and he are doing this independ-
ently-a pair of private prospectors if
you know what i mean i want you to
protect my official non-interference so
to speak and still guarantee the zarapore
manganese deposits for britains war
that makes you more or less of a diplo-
mat do you think you can manage it
terry

  sure why not i thought you said
this was dangerous

  it is the man who killed dr khopri
may be on your train tonight

  i see oreilly studied the glowing
stub of his cheroot who is he

  i wish i knew terry does that mean
you say no

   hell no i dont say no on the con-



trary gives me something to think about
on the train

  if only henry fayne were still in
zarapore i should say the matter would
be greatly simplified but he left ten
days ago you know what he looks like
by the way

  sure i met him while he was here
oreilly nodded hes a skinny red-

-	faced sourpuss that looks like hes tried
everything and dont like any of it
good the maharajah smiled im
glad you remember in case he should
turn up along the way youll do it
then terry

  sure said oreilly extending his
hand

  at this moment an aide-de-camp en-
tered and made a peculiar grimace at the
spectacfe of the maharajah bare-waisted
shaking hands with the red-headed
colossus

  oreilly immediately looked grim
straightened up and saluted gravely he
said ill do your bidding your high-
ness

  the maharajah looked as dignified as
a man in shorts can he replied good
then pleasant trip oreilly sahib
when he left the palace oreilly
hadnt gone a dozen yards before some-
body took a shot at him

ii

the bullet spattered against the wall
just above his head and showered
plaster down upon his broad shoulders
at the same instant he recognized the
grimly familiar report of a pistol shot

  he knew it was a shot because the
only vehicles in the street at the time
were bicycles a horse-drawn ghaii and
a bullock cart loaded with ripe jute-
none of which were apt to backfire the
pedestrians in the crowded street looked
innocent enough too-fat marwaris go-
ing home from the cotton bazaar
bearded moslems thin black tamils red-
turbaned sikhs

  none of them seemed to have heard
the shot unless it was the only eui opean
in sight-a plump perspiring anglican
missionary whose clerical collar seemed
to dissolve as he hurried down the street
in pursiut of a carriage no the shot
had probably been fired from one of the
shuttered second-story windows above
the shops across the road

  and there was no sense in looking for
the marksman now since he had missed
he would no doubt show up again later
the maharajah was right in his guess
that the murderer of dr khopri would
be aboard oreillys train

  oreilly reached the station fifteen
minutes before train time without be-
coming a further target his friends who
came to see him off had been there at
least an hour inasmuch as the hindu
mind seems incapable of judging time
in units as small as ten minutes

  the maharajah of course was not
there but he had sent an adc with a
heavy package which oreilly immed-
iately clamped under his arm it at-
tracted no particular attention since all
his friends had brought farewell gifts
the minister of education brought a set
of poker chips carved from buffalo horn
the subadar of civil police contributed a
pan box of hammered brass which had
been beaten from the brass knuckles that
killed ganeshi mohan the mad yogi
offered a stone jug of trance-provoking
palm toddy

   just as the train puffed into the station
from the south headlight boring into the
hot darkness whistle shrieking oreillys
travelling companion came puffing into
the station from the north

  professor gurda was a rotund little
hindu with buck teeth protruding from
beneath a dejected black mustache and
enough white turban piled above his
bulging forehead to fill a good-sized
laundry basket he was so completely
encumbered with cloth-tied baggage
brass pots books an umbrella and what
appeared to be a weeks supply of food
that oreilly was afraid that if the pro-
fessor put down his impedimenta to
shake hands he would never be able to
collect it all again before the train pulled
out

  howdy prof oreilly said looks
like were traveling in the same- whoa
hold it

  professor gurda tried to join the palms
of his hands in front of his face to make
the customary salutation and four books
and a brass pot cascaded into oreillys
arms assuring himself by a side glance
that his own bearers were loading his
luggage and bedding roll into what ap-
peared to be the only vacant first-class
compartment oreilly piled the books
back on the professor and took his arm
to guide him to the train

  goodbye johnny he called to the
subadar good luck diwana he shook
outstretched hands goodbye mugs
ill send you all picture postcards of
brooklyn bridge

  the station master blew his whistle
the engineer answered shrilly the train
jerked and the guard ran along the side
of the cars closing doors oreilly
boosted the professor aboard just as the
train began to move he slammed the
door turned to yell final goodbyes to the
crowd on the platform when he turned
away again he saw that two other eu-
ropean passengers were settling down in
the compartment

one of them at least was a european
and an anglican missionary at that
he looked very much like the plump
gentleman with the wilted clerical collar
oreilly had seen hurrying away from
the palace just after someone had taken a
pot-shot at him

  he was for the moment busy with his
luggage so oreilly turned to eye the
other passenger who might not be en-
tirely european he was a tall sallow-
faced black-haired gentleman and the
cut of his elegant well-pressed pongee
suit was flawlessly english

  something about the east of his nar-
row eyes however and the purple cres-
cents at the base of his polished finger-
nails told oreilly that there was a touch
of the tar brush somewhere in his line-
age

  the eurasian favored oreilly with a
greasy smile good evening mr
oreilly he said

  oreilly puckered his bushy red eye-
brows what jail did we meet in he
demanded

  the eurasian chuckled there was a
cold mirthless quality in the sound
oreilly sahib is famous from the
deccan to kashmir he said you cant
hope to travel incognito unless you
change the color of your hair and your
incredible stature im happy we meet
by chance after all ive heard of you
my name is frank janeiro

  janeiro    portuguese india    goa
  prince mahmed    chance meeting
my eye oreilly thought

  traveling far mr oreilly purred
janeiro

  pretty far new york

  new york again that mirthless
chuckle i fancy youll have to change
trains

  go ahead and fancy said oreilly
he looked at professor gurda who was
making a nest for himself among his
strange luggage on one of the leather-
covered berths the professor had
slipped off his shoes and had tucked his
feet under him

  the anglican clergyman was settled
in another corner of the compartment
smoking a crooked pipe and reading the
bible

  your friend appears to be starting out
on an expedition to explore the sindh
desert said janeiro indicating gurda

  i am professor gurda ba of his
highness maharajah vinayaks high
school said the professor grinning with
all his teeth am unfamiliar with train
journeys having remained static in zara-
pore since return from allahabad uni-
versity twenty-nine years past am
therefore prepared for all exigencies

  i see janeiro nodded pleasantly
and are you going to delhi too pro-
fessor

  professor gurda tells me hes visiting
the old folks in agra oreilly put in
quickly

  yes of course janeiros thin dark
lips curled in a curious smile

oreilly dropped the wooden shutter
to look out the window the train
was speeding through rice fields aglitter
with the cold green light of a million
fireflies he watched the shadows of stiff
tal palms and the pyramidal domes of a
hindu temple slide by in the hot night

  the corner of his glance however was
still very much occupied inside the com-
partment he could not forget that
either the eurasian or the man with the
clerical collar might very possibly have
taken a shot at him outside the mahara-
jahs palace when he saw the clergy-
man staring at him strangely over the
edge of his bible therefore oreilly
turned suddenly

  see anything outa the ordinary about
my rear view padre he asked

  the clergyman closed his bible and
smiled there is nothing ordinary about
you from any view my friend he said
gently

  didnt i see you this afternoon in
zarapore outside the maharajahs
palace oreilly pursued

  quite possibly if you did you saw
the reverend eustace potts in a some-
what flustered harried and not at all dig-
nified condition i was hurrying to keep
a last minute appointment there was so
much to do and so little time to do it in
before leaving for delhi

  i hope you finished your business
okay said oreilly pointedly

  our work is never done the rev-
erend eustace potts sighed and puffed
several times on his dead pipe no
doubt you know our mission school in
zarapore we have been making changes
we- could i trouble you for a light

  sure thing reverend oreilly
struck a match he was careful to hold
the flame at some distance from the
clergyman and well to his left so that the
reverend potts would have to lean for-
ward with his left elbow raised in order
to light his pipe oreilly wanted a closer
look at an intriguing bulge beneath the
clerical left armpit

  the locomotive whistled for an ap-
proaching station and the clacking
rhythm of the rails began to slow down
oreilly suddenly decided to get off and
send a wire to his friend the subadar of
civil police at zarapore inquiring as to
the background which might cause a man
of god to wear a shoulder holster

  thank you    very    much 
said the reverend eustace potts between
contented puffs

  youre welcome as- youre very wel-

come padre said oreilly any time
the train was screeching to a stop it
would be a short stop and the only one
before mogul junction where he would
have to change trains for delhi but he
could still get an answer to his wire at
mogul junction with the help of the
various hindu gods responsible for the
balance between lethargy and industry
in hindu telegraph operators

oreilly opened the door mumbled
something about a breath of air and
waded through the station crowds of
water-vendors with their glistening black
goatskin bags luggage coolies the melee
of arriving and departing passengers

  at the far end of the train twelve men
were holding up long pink curtains so
that a purdah lady could get into her
compartment without being subjected to
the gaze of vulgar masculine eyes

  when he found the dim-lighted tele-
graph office oreilly addressed the fol-
lowing telegram to the mbadar

  dear johnny please find out ek dum
  what reverend eustace potts was
  doing at zarapore mission school
  that rates packing a gun reply
  mogul junction

oreilly

  while he was licking the stamps to af-
fix to the telegraph blank oreilly rea-
lized with a cold sinking feeling that he
had neglected to bring the package of ore
samples with him-the heavy compact
oblong packet wrapped in green paper
and sealed with two great blobs of green
wax

  of course professor gurda was in the
compartment with it but the professor
making his first train journey in twenty-
nine years was not apt to prove much of
a watchdog against a couple of wolves
such as janeiro and the padre might be

  while the halfcaste telegraph operator
was fumbling to make change the station
masters whistle sounded the operator
lost count of his paper rupees square
nickel two anna bits and copper piece
he started counting all over oreilly
left him counting and elbowed his way
across the platform just as the red cars
began to move

  he caught the latch of his compartment
as it slid by jerked the door open
bounded in he was relieved to see
janeiro and the reverend eustace potts
still in their places then he noted that
the rotund hen-like professor gurda was
no longer squatting in his nest of lug-
gage

  quickly he crossed the compartment to
the far corner opened the lavatory door
professor gurda was not there either

  the locomotive whistle screamed the
clicking song of the rails rose to a high-
pitched even purr

ill

the reverend potts seemed lost in rev-
erie as he smoked his pipe he was
no longer reading his bible frank jane-
iro had a smug half-smile on his lips as
he looked out the window

  which of you gents is the magician
oreilly asked its a good trick
trick the reverend potts appeared
puzzled

  sure trick oreilly repeated the
vanishing professor

  ah yes droned janeiro professor
gurda has gone hasnt he i hadnt
noticed

  i suppose he just climbed up a rope
and disappeared pulling up the rope
after him oreilly said i hear hindus
are like that

  i couldnt say really janeiro said
i was out stretching my legs on the
platform i dont know where he went

  you didnt see him go up in a cloud
of bright green smoke did you padre 

  as a matter of fact the professor got
down in quite a prosaic and mundane
manner said the reverend potts i
assumed that he had gone after you mr
oreilly

  hell be back shortly no doubt hes
left his household accoutrements be-
hind janeiro chuckled

  hes got pretty short legs to be run-
ning after the train for long oreilly
said hell be outa breath by the time
we get to the next stop

  silently cursing himself for having
left the professor alone oreilly sat
down in his own corner with all the
casualness he could muster he began
rearranging his baggage as he restacked
his bags and his farewell gifts the cold
feeling at the pit of his stomach turned
to a hard lump of ice the maharajahs
ore samples-the green packet with the
big green seals-was gone

the roar and flashing lights of a pass-
ing train occupied the next twenty
seconds giving oreilly a welcome res-
pite to light a burma cheroot and try
to organize his thoughts the disappear-
ance of professor gurda and of the ore
samples were certainly not disconnected
phenomena

  had the professor carried them off to a
safer place after having his suspicions
aroused by janeiro and the reverend
potts not likely in view of the ap-
parent naivete of the hindu was he
perhaps himself an agent of the fifth
column who had merely departed for
greener fields

  possibly after all the professor was
supporting his family on some sixty
rupees a month-about twenty dollars-
and he might conceivably be attracted by
the musical crackling of a few thousand-
rupee bank notes or had both the pro-
fessor and the ore samples been deftly re-
moved from the picture by janeiro or the
reverend potts-or both-who were now
merely awaiting a convenient moment
to dispose of oreilly

  whatever the answer there was little
oreilly could do about it now except
keep awake these damned indian
trains with their separate compartments
prevented him from making any search
for professor gurda in other cars if
only they had civilized trains with con-
necting corridors the way american
railways did he wouldnt be quite so
helpless

  as it was he was locked in with jane-
iro and the reverend potts and his fum-
bled mission for the maharajah-until
the train stopped again at mogul junc-
tion they were due there at midnight
still an hour to go

  the train wheels clack-clacked over
switch frogs the steel flanges screamed
against a curve in the black distance
the smoky lights of a village wheeled
past oreilly puffed furiously on his
cheroot and let the perspiration trickle
down his cheeks unnoticed he would
wait until the next station before taking
further steps

  when the train finally stopped at mo-
gul junction with a great steamy sigh
oreilly noticed with some surprise that
both janeiro and the reverend eustace
potts were preparing to get off with the
ore samples and professor gurda out of
the way it would seem more natural for
the saboteur of the zarapore manganese
fields to continue to bombay by the same
train instead of changing here for the
punjab express


   that both men were getting off with
 oreilly could only mean that the job
 was not yet finished that oreilly was
 still considered a military objective so
 much the better there was still a chance
 for oreilly to redeem himself

   the door of the compartment opened
 out of the hubbub and confusion of the
 station crowd oreillys bearers mater-
 ialized to reclaim his luggage

   better pack this stuff out too ali
 the redhead pointed out professor gur-
 das abandoned bundles to his white-
 bearded servant

   quite a new role for you isnt it
 oreilly sahib said janeiro with a
 crooked smile being nursemaid to an
 absent-minded hindu school teacher
 i just thought id turn his stuff over
 to the station master in case he shows
 up on the next train oreilly answered

   he jumped to the platform-and al-
 most demolished professor gurda who at
 that moment emerged panting from be-
 hind a stack of luggage

 rphe rotund professor bounced back
 against a large bejeweled parsee
 lady caromed off two scowling pathans
 and was just about to collapse seat-fore-
 most on the charcoal stove of an itiner-
 ant curry vendor when oreilly grabbed
 his arm and restored his balance

   where the hell did you come from
 bellowed oreilly he didnt know whe-
 ther to hug the professor or kick his
 pants-if he wore pants instead of a
 dhoti

   so    sorry  panted professor
 gurda

   dont ever do that to me again
 oreilly admonished unless you got
 reasons have you

   was unavoidably detained in inter-
 mediate-class compartment said the
 professor encountered former student
 en route to bombay and was engaging in
 friendly chit-chat with same when train
 resumed operation

   okay well skip it as long as youve
 got the whoosis sie

   got what safe please

   oreilly glanced back at the train and
 saw janeiro and the reverend potts busy
 with their luggage the ore samples
 he said

 professor gurdas expression was a
 complete blank

 the rocks oreilly amplified the
 package of manganese wrapped in green
 paper

 the professor shook his head until his
 high-piled turban trembled violently
 please pardon puzzlement oreilly
 sahib he said but understood green
 package was confided to you

 you mean you havent got it

 not single iota

 oreillys comments were completely
 unintelligible to professor gurda whose
 english curriculum at alahabad univer-
 sity had quite overlooked the rich and
 picturesque vocabularies of brooklyn
 dock hands manhattan taxi drivers and
 army mule-skinners

 look prof said oreilly when he
 had run out of cuss words you and me
 have played the maharajah a dirty trick
 and im ashamed of us how loud can
 you yell

 am not noted for loudness although
 voice is quite distinct and somewhat
 shrill you are wishing demonstration
 not yet prof but listen there goes
 janeiro and the reverend potts into the
 waiting room with their baggage coolies

 i want you to follow em in and stay with
 em if they try to leave the station or
 start any monkey-business with you i
 want you to yell

 what words shall i yell please

 

   anything police murder fire just
 yell your head off so i can hear-you at
 the other end of the platform i got to
 look in at the telegraph office for a min-
 ute

   oreilly found a miracle at the tele-
 graph office the reply to his zarapore
 wire had already arrived it read

   sorry reverend eustace potts quite
   unknown to local ecclesiastics or
   mission school pleasant trip
   oreilly sahib

gopalsingh subadar

rv

 rphe punjab mail did not come through
 j- mogul junction until  a m so
 the passengers from the south had their
 choice between a long dreary vigil or a
 short restless nap

   most of them were evidently going to
 try to sleep coming back from the tele-
 graph office-the professor had not yelled
 -oreilly found he had to step over
 rows of third-class passengers stretched
 out on the dusty cement of the platform
 and in the first-class waiting room bed-
 ding rolls were being opened on hard
 benches and europeans in shirtsleeves
 were assuming uncomfortable positions
 in chairs

   a smoky lamp burned dimly on a wall
 bracket and the hot gloom smelled of
 kerosene a punkah made of tattered
 strips of cloth swung lazily back and
 forth across the ceiling stirring up warm
 odors

   janeiro had installed himself in a
 chaise longue rented from the station
 master for six annas and was apparently
 asleep already his head reposing upon a
 pneumatic pillow oreilly noted that
 he had unfastened his collar and tie but
 that he had not taken off his shoes

   the reverend eustace potts was sitting
 on a bench with his back against the wall
 his eyes were closed and his hands were
 clasped across his plump stomach but
 oreilly was sure he was not asleep
 he had made no effort to loosen his
 clothing and the bulge under his left
 armpit was quite distinct

   professor gurda had unwound his tur-
 ban and was squatting in a corner rub-
 bing his shaven pate when oreilly saw
 him

   you are still requiring yells oreilly
 sahib he asked

   ill take a raincheck on the yells
 oreilly replied you may as well try
 and get a little shuteye before the mail
 comes along

   professor gurda adopted the sugges-
 tion with amazing promptness oreilly
 had himself known fatigue so intense that
 he could doze sitting up but he had
 never seen anyone fall asleep in that
 position as quickly or as loudly as pro-
 fessor gurda

   no doubt the professors vocal cords
 were all primed for the yelling that
 oreilly had ordered and were releasing
 their pent-up sound at any rate the
 succession of guttural gasps whistles in-
 haled gurgles and exhaled moans which
 emerged from between the professors
 buck teeth was a marvel of cacophony

 oreilly took off his coat loosened his
 collar and belt he tipped up the stone
 jug for a swig of the yogis palm toddy
 and almost immediately opened his
 mouth to let the smoke escape when he
 had caught his breath he sprawled on
 the vacant endof a bench from where
 he could watch the door he had no in-
 tention of sleeping and was glad to dis-
 cover that the toddy was an aid to wake-
 fulness a few drops would probably give
 insomnia to a week-old corpse

 fphe assistant station master came in to
 turn down the smelly jamp when he
 left the waiting room the wick sputtered
 the flame popped and expired little by
 little the sounds on the platform died
 away until the dark silence was marred
 only by the creaking of the punkah and
 the snoring of professor gurda

   oreilly fought off drowsiness the
 third time he found himself nodding he
 was just about to reach for the jug when
 he felt his nerves go suddenly tense
 someone was moving in the room he
 sat up very straight straining his eyes
 but could make out nothing in the dark-
 ness then he heard a sharp metallic
 sound like the catch of a valise spring-
 ing open his gaze turned in the direction
 of the sound he saw a shadow straight-
 en up glide silently toward the gray ob-
 long that was the door

   for an instant a plump silhouette was
 stamped against the dim light from out-
 side oreilly recognized the reverend
 eustace potts

   at once oreilly was on his feet he
 waited a few seconds then stealthily
 crossed the room he paused at the chaise
 longue where janeiro slept he listened
 the eurasian was breathing evenly as
 he went out the door oreilly could still
 hear professor gurdas discordant organ
 notes

   the reverend potts was already at the
 far end of the platform hurrying into the
 gloom oreilly stepped over a knot of
 sleeping hindus and set off in long-leg-
 ged pursuit

   from beyond the station oreilly
 caught sight of the self-styled missionary
 walking rapidly behind the row of little
 square bungalows where the railway
 employes lived the houses were very
 white under the blazing stars behind
 each one on raised cement floors people
 were sleeping beneath tents of mosquito
 netting here and there a punkah swung
 from a gallows-like frame over the out-
 door sleepers

   the reverend potts was a good hun-
 dred yards ahead a dark phantom glid-
 ing past the railway bungalows moving
 toward the native village the native
 part of mogul junction consisted of only
 a few straggling streets of lopsided mud-
 and-bamboo huts with roofs of thatch or
 tile so oreilly was not worried when
 he lost sight of his quarry at the first
 turn

   he continued down the dusty lane un-
 til he came to an open space on the other
 side where cakes of cowdung had been
 stacked to dry he stopped to listen
 there was no sound but the mournful
 laughter of jackals somewhere on the
 baked plain far beyond the dark dump
 of palms

   oreilly turned into the next street
 without catching sight of eustace potts
 he did see however a crack of light
 shining between the solid wooden shut-
 ters of a hut just a few steps ahead he
 approached carefully brought one eye
 close to the narrow opening then he
 smiled to himself

 tnside the bare mud-plastered room
 a sat two men one was the man who
 called himself reverend eustace potts
 the other was a thin red-faced fish-
 eyed individual whom oreilly recog-
 nized as henry fayne the mineralogist
 from delhi

 on a table between them burned a na-
 tive lamp-a wick floating in an earthen-
 ware bowl of cocoanut oil also on the
 table-and oreilly breathed a deep sigh
 of relief-was an oblong green package
 bearing two large blobs of green sealing
 wax the reverend potts kept the fingers
 of one hand tightly clasped about the
 package as he spoke to fayne his voice
 was low-pitched and came to oreilly
 only as an unintelligible rumble fayne
 said little although he nodded occasion-
 ally

  oreilly congratulated himself he had
not only recovered practically the miss-
ing ore samples but he had established
the criminal complicity of henry fayne
of delhi unearthed his zarapore lieuten-
ant and in all likelihood put his finger
on the murderer of dr khopri whats
more he had caught them with the
goods he-

  faynes lips moved he and the rever-
end potts turned their heads abruptly to-
ward the window oreilly knew they
could not see him but it was uncom-
fortable to feel them staring in his direc-
tion the reverend potts quickly unbut-
toned his clerical jacket slipped his right
hand toward his left armpit fayne
reached over to pinch out the floating
wick the room went dark

  oreilly dropped to his haunches his
hand moved to his hip seeking the com-
fortable touch of steel it was not cold
steel-nothing was cold in india at this
time of year-but it was comforting nev-
ertheless his fingers curled tightly about
the butt of his 

  keeping his head below the level of the
sill he backed slowly away from the
window he wanted to reach the corner
of the hut where he could still command
an exit from the window and yet watch
the door if the two men tried to escape
that way then with brutal abruptness
the universe came roaring down about
his ears

  oreilly did not know what hit him
his fleeting impression was that the sky
had fallen on him from the rear striking
the back of his skull with a great
crunching smash there was a blaze of
pain a brief whirling flash of giddy light
he felt himself drawn into a vortex of
dizzy darkness a void in which nothing
existed

he was out for only a few seconds he
thought because as he fought his
way back to dazed consciousness he was
aware of things going on around him
he was sure he heard running footsteps
but when he tried to follow his muscles
disobeyed

  he thought too that he heard the roar
of a passing train the shriek of a loco-
motive whistle the bark of a pistol the
slamming of a door-but he couldnt be
sure perhaps they were just part of the
confused noises drumming in his ears
time and space seemed completely
scrambled and he couldnt quite find his
own place in the chaos

   with great effort he finally raised him-
 self to one knee he groped along the
 ground and touched his gun that was a
 relief he stood up a sick wave of
 dizziness swept over him and he leaned
 against he wall of the hut he was aware
 of a throbbing welt growing on the back
 of his head he breathed deeply and
 found the wbrld settling down to its old
 solidity beneath his feet he began to
 walk	

  he made he circuit of the hut without
meeting anyone he came back to the
door it was locked there would be
nobody inside of course fayne and the
padre had been frightened away and
yet it seemed impossible that either of
them should have had time to sneak
around behind him and lay him out cold
perhaps it was someone who had follow-
ed him from the station janeiro per-
haps or professor gurda maybe hed
better have a look inside anyhow

  he struck a match to examine the door
lock he was so startled by what the

flame revealed that he dropped the
match it sizzled out in a puddle of
crimson there was blood seeping out
from under the door

   oreilly stepped back then flung his
 shoulder against the wooden panel pain-
 ful fireworks went off inside his head he
 stepped back again the panel was flimsy
 and the lock primitive he tried again
 there was a splintering crash the door
 shuddered inward

   oreilly stepped aside poked his gun
 past the jamb

   come outa there he ordered

   there was no answer across the street
 a shutter opened and a woman called
 something in hindustani a few houses
 further on a light appeared an old man
 came out carrying a lantern

   get away with that light oreilly
 commanded chalao scram

   the old man stopped in his tracks

   oreilly cautiously ventured inside the
 hut at the third step his foot brushed
 something heavy but yielding he
 changed his course hugged the wall
 feeling his way along until he was oppo-
 site the door satisfied that his adver-
 saries at least the abled-bodied ones had
 gone he shouted

  you can bring that lantern now
 chiragh lao

   the old man came as far as the door
 then grunted set down the lantern in a
 hurry and backed away in awe

 the glow- illuminated a man lying on
 the floor in a pool of blood his face
 was turned toward oreilly and the eyes
 were closed it was the reverend eus-
 tace potts

   oreilly walked quickly to the motion-
 less figure near the padres outstretched
 hand was his bible between him and the
 table was the torn green paper which
 had wrapped the maharajahs manganese
 samples

   oreilly bent over to peer into the pale
 face he felt the shoulder holster it was
 empty he explored the mans sticky
 shirt for a heartbeat

   the reverend eustace potts eyelids
 fluttered open he stared dully at oreil-
 ly his lips moved faintly but no words
 came then his fingers moved he was
 trying to point to something something
 on his person

   sure i know youre hurt reverend
 oreilly said its probably your own
 damned fault but ill see what i can do
 for you which one of those mugs shot
 you

   the fingers still moved to oreilly
 they seemed to be pointing to the pocket
 of the clerical tunic

   the redhead plunged his big fist into
 the pocket brought ought half a dozen
 polished gray discs he stared at them a
 puzzled frown wrinkling his forehead
 they looked like he buffalo-horn poker
 chips that the minister of education had
 given him what the devil

   he stared at the reverend potts whose
 pain-wracked eyes were full of questions
 as they held his gaze oreilly looked at
 the horn discs again then he looked at
 the bible on the floor and the torn green
 paper an expansive grin bloomed sud-
 denly on his rugged face he nodded vio-
 lently that he understood

   i get it reverend he said nice
 work

   a shadow of a smile flickered in the
 clergymans eyes he sighed his lids
 closed

oreilly gathered up the wounded
man in his arms strode to the door
a crowd of indians had gathered in the
narrow street watching in silence

   is there a railway doctor in this

 dump oreilly demanded can one of
 you lead me to a doctor hakim hail

 a naked brown boy stepped forward
 hakim-ka-ghar idhar hai

 sahib he said starting off for the
 colony of railway bungalows

   oreilly followed the reverend eus-
 tace potts was no featherweight and the
 lump on the back of oreillys head gave
 off sparks and steam at every jolting
 step but he managed to keep up with the
 boy until they reached the doctors bun-
 galow

   the railway doctor was a white-haired
 old man blinded by sleep naked except
 for a pair of shorts and a flannel cum-
 merbund he came shuffling out to his
 veranda in response to oreillys bellow-
 ing

   what in the name of brahma is going
 on he grumbled sleepily another de-
 railment or is mrs sousa having pre-
 mature pains or- good lord harrison
 bring him inside quickly

   the doctor had finally got his eyes open
 wide enough to see the limp and bloody
 figure in oreillys arms and instantly
 he was thoroughly awake he led the way
 into the house calling for lights hot wa-
 ter and instruments

   as he bent over the wounded man cut-
 ting away his clothing he asked what
 the ruddy dickens is harrison doing in
 mogul junction

   the mans name is the reverend eus-
 tace potts said oreilly

   yes yes i know the doctor smiled
 tolerantly as he worked you c i d
 men like to be ruddy mysterious dont
 you but dont forget ive been in india
 fifty years and i know every secret agent
 between bengal and the western ghats
 ive known harrison for twenty years
 he cant fool me by dressing up like a
 ruddy vicar

   is he hurt bad doc

  hell have a belly ache for a few
 weeks the doctor said lucky hes got
 plenty of paunch to spare so he wont
 miss the few inches of blubber that car-
 ried away of course ive got to be care-
 ful about digging out these bits of under-
 shirt the bullet has planted here and
 there    hello harrison does that
 hurt

   the sting of antiseptic and the bite of
 the doctors probe had penetrated the
 pseudo-clergymans coma he opened
 his eyes

   i dont suppose theres any use of my
 asking you to introduce me to your
 friend here harrison the doctor went
 on because youll only tell me hes the
 viceroy himself traveling incognito hes
 a c i d agent of course

  the man who called himself eustace
 potts smiled wanly he is-for tonight
 he whispered

   thats a hint for me to get on with
 the job said oreilly ill be seeing
 you

 long before he reached the waiting
 room again oreilly knew that pro-
 fessor gurda was still there and enjoy-
 ing undisturbed slumber no other
 human could produce the hair-raising
 dissonances that resounded on the hot
 night

   he hurried to the bench under which
 he had left his baggage and held his
 breath as he looked through his parcels
 for the box of jaipur enamel which had
 contained the minister of educations
 poker chips

   there it was heaven be praised it
 was much heavier than it had been ori-
 ginally strange he hadnt noticed that
 before he moved toward the door and


opened the box yes there wa the col-
lection or rocks and clods that meant so
much to the maharajah and perhaps to
britains war smart guys these boys of
the criminal investigation department

  oreilly wondered if mr harrison
alias eustace potts expected him to do
anything further about janeiro and
fayne janeiro of course was gone from
the waiting room it was undoubtedly he
who had smacked oreilly from the rear
just as it was fayne who had shot harri-
son-potts on discovering a bible in place
of the ore samples

  oreilly had no authority to act but
he felt the least he could do would be to
give justice a gentle nudge he went to
look up the station master

  he was surprised to find the station
masters office locked and the light out
he could have sworn that when he
passed a moment before the office had
been open he was still rattling the door
when the tail of his glance picked up
three spectral figures moving across the
tracks toward the freight yards perhaps
a hundred yards away something about
the way the specters moved told him that
they were wearing white european
trousers not hindu dhotis immediately
he started in cautious pursuit

  he remained within the protecting
shadow of the station walls until he saw
the three figures disappear behind a line
of goods vans on a siding then he drew
his gun and sprinted

when he reached the line of cars he
again slowed to a stealthy pace he
climbed silently over the couplings be-
tween two cars and looked in both direc-
tions

  again he saw the three specters they
were only fifty yards from him now-
close enough for him to recognize them
janeiro and fayne were marching the
station master before them at the point
o faynes gun marching him toward the
next track where a handcar stood

  thats all fayne up with your hands
janeiro oreilly bellowed suddenly

  fayne whirled and fired twice the
station master started to run stumbled
and fell flat on his face oreilly ducked
back between the cars his  thundering

  fayne and janeiro started pushing the
handcar down the track oreilly fired
again he could hear the bullet clang
against steel and ricochet whining into
the night

  the motor on the handcar wheezed
coughed and popped into action janeiro
and fayne jumped aboard as the car be-
gan to gain momentum

  oreilly leaped from between the
freight cars took aim squeezed the trig-
ger then started running both janeiro
and fayne were shooting at him now
the orange flashes of their guns made a
flickering pattern with the intermittent
blue flame of the motor exhaust

  oreilly raised his arm drew careful
bead to make the last shots count then
his finger froze on the trigger his arm
fell and his mouth opened he could
not have explained why he wanted to
yell and he didnt have to explain be-
cause no sounds came from his parted
lips

  the men on the handcar probably
wouldnt have heard him anyhow the
motor was making too much noise-so
much noise that they didnt hear the
switch engine come charging around the
corner of the freight shed on the same
track facing the rear to exchange shots
with oreilly they had their backs to the
onrushing locomotive when it struck the
handcar

  the crash and clatter of rending metal
dinned on oreillys ears the handcar
seemed to explode flinging pieces in all
directions pieces of wood and steel of
eurasian and mineralogist of cowcatcher
and gasoline motor

  when the switch engine came to a stop
and oreilly and the station master ran
to where the handcar had been there
wasnt quite enough of fayne and jane-
iro left for the railway doctor to work on

the punjab mail luckily was a few
minutes late so oreilly had time to
get professor gurda awake and ready for
loading they had a compartment to
themselves so oreilly could continue his
detailed historyof the lump on the back
of his head

  so you can see that the guys in delhi
werent quite as dumb as his highness

thought since they had a c i d dick in
zarapore watching the whole show he
said

he ran a hand through his red hair

and when this dick in padres rig gets
left alone at that last station where you
and me and janeiro get off he figures
were too careless with the ore samples
and hell help out by making em harder
to steal so he dumps the rocks into that
box where the poker chips were and he
wraps the green paper around his bible
which was about the same size as the
other package

he knows where this bird fayne is
hiding in mogul junction so he goes
around with the package probably ex-
pecting fayne to make some crack which
would show whether there was a nazi
in the rock pile or just the maharajahs
half-brother mahmed all fayne did
though was to say something to get the
padre to turn his head while he puts out
the light and plugs him in the stomach

of course the padre must have spot-
ted me for a cop right away and a new
york cop at that so he knew he wouldnt
have to draw diagrams he knew a new
york cop would be following him like a
bird dog and if anything happened why
itd be a cinch id get the signals on the
poker chips right away

and the chips wouldnt mean a thing
to anybody else but me its funny how
cops sort of feel a thing from one cop to
the other without saying a word sixth
avenue sense we call it in manhattan

the padrell probably be tickled to
death when he comes to tomorrow and
finds out that those two yeggs accident-
ally committed suicide trying to make a
getaway and did they commit it you
couldnt have done a better job with a
meat ax

the roar of the punjab mail crossing
a bridge covered oreillys voice the
first gleam of dawn lay upon the river
making the girders of the bridge seem
very black as they leaped past the car
window on the far bank the minarets
of a mosque raised thin dark fingers
against the paling sky like an adrnoni-
tion for silence oreilly stopped talk-
ing

but professor gurda snored

jeopardys jewel

     

by h bedford-jones

author of sinister sapphire the angry amethyst  etc

the detective for the jewel insur-
ance people was cool efficient cal-
lous he sat in the office of
shipmans gem laboratory-quite with-
out emotion-described the strange case
of the young woman who had lost
herself

  shes been seen here in this state
in this city he went on because
of her strange mania for jewels she
may turn up at any of the big shops
or she may come here to your place
well run her down of course and shall
count upon your help

  shipman and his assistant korvo as-
sented with courteous interest

  inwardly the tall hawk-faced ship-
man was suffering a chaos of emo-
tions this final blow had shocked him
deeply might come here she had
already been here four times changing
the course of his whole thought and ac-
tion and life

  and now he must lie about it to the
insurance people he luke shipman
one of the foremosl experts in precious
stones must lie if he would protect
her

this young woman disappeared three

 months ago from seattle where she
 was attending college went on the dis-
 passionate voice shes been reported
 in various cities always in connection
 with jewel thefts she must have a
 pretty swell collection by now

   her background suggested korvo
 who appreciated the suffering of his
 chief her name family and so
 forth 

   the detective went over his notes to
 shipman the torture was growing in-
 tolerable despite everything he had
 believed in this girl trusted her helped

 this evasive sinister beauty
 whose face is in the heart of
 every priceless gem pays her
 fifth visit to shipmans labora-
 tory with her she brings a
 shimmering opal-and a proph-
 ecy of one last soul-shattering
 conflict

he understood at last on the white beach
there at guaymas facing leveled rifles in
the early sunrise

her heaven help him he was in love
with her yet this information hurt
more than anything else

  marie wilson aged twenty-two of
excellent family her father dead her
mother remarried she does not lack
money having her own inheritance
heres a photograph

  he offered it

  shipman forced himself to look at
it his heart chilled it was her like-
ness this was the girl who had sat
here in this very office and he must
lie about it

  now we dont want the police in it
we dont want her arrested if we can
avoid it said the detective appar-
ently its a case of mania of mental
unbalance shes screwy on no other
subject in no other way

  she steals stones and hoards em
my business is to get em back her
family will make good every loss theres
to be no prosecution

  but mind you lord knows what may
happen with such a mental case a
woman of the very highest character if
deranged on the subject of jewels may
go to any length

  shipman lied korvo lied the detective
presently took his leave humming a gay
tune with him it was just another case
to be run down and closed


 tn the office of this laboratory whose
 brains and machines served the jewel
 trade of the entire country where every
 last secret of precious stones was laid
 bare by the latest scientific research the
 two men sat and looked at each other

   chief i know how you feel said
 korvo gently his dark powerful fea-
 tures held a great compassion now
 this backs up my theory dont feel down
 in the mouth we can get in touch with
 this girl at least shell be coming here
 were the only ones who can help her
 shipman groaned if your theory is
 right shes possessed by a devil

   yes a devil whos mad about jewels
 and thats why we can help i believe
 we can rid her of this devil i know the
 way ive been reading up another two
 or three days and ill be ready to han-
 dle the case

    remember her only hope is in us let
 the medicos get hold of her and shes
 lost theyd never believe in this theory
 theyd call her insane

   and shes not insane so cheer up
 chief need me this afternoon

   no

   then ill run downtown its on her
 case too theres one thing i need when
 we do take her in hand and i know
 where to find it

   the door closed behind him alone
 shipman gloomily poured himself a
 drink he needed it believe in devils-
 of course the doctors wouldnt who
 would

    in the effort to put it all out of his
 mind he flung himself into work the
 laboratory specialized in testing and
 treating stones in mounting them cut-
 ting them inventing new uses for them 
 and in teaching all these things to the
 trade

   shipman was dictating furiously when
 the interphone buzzed the reception-
 ist in the outer office spoke

 that young lady mr shipman miss
 crews

 for an instant shipmans heart stood
 still then he found voice

 send her in at once

 she walked in as the stenographer
 departed she stood inside the door re-
 garding him coolly distantly almost with
 hostility but she was very lovely slim
 proud darkly capable

 im glad you came shipman started
 up as she came to the desk so youre
 marie wilson thats your real name

 she halted angry suspicion flamed in
 her eyes

 how do you know that

 a detective was here youre being
 sought everywhere shipman said rap-
 idly we took care of it but youre in
 frightful danger of being picked up
 wont you put yourself in my hands
 wont you trust me let me-

 i dont care to discuss it at all she
 broke in to his shocked amazement no
 doubt of her hostility now i came
 here because i had to come and ill
 come again they cant catch me you
 know the worst about me and youll not
 give me away or trap me

 no said shipman in a low voice
 no you know you can trust me but
 youre not yourself today youre-

 i am myself she interrupted again
 almost with disdain i came to ask you
 to put a stone in the machine for me
 its glorious glorious i cant wait to
 see it to hear what it says to me

let me have it said shipman
quietly

 a s she searched in her bag he forced
 himself to see her objectively with-
 out sentiment he knew the truth now
 

 her words had confirmed the worst sus-
 picions

   she was two persons and this was the
 other person today the devil the ele-
 mental as korvo called it the being that
 had seized upon her driving her despite
 herself with a lust for jewels

   hitherto shipman had seen her fight-
 ing against this alter ego but today the
 girl he knew was gone and here was a
 hard cold passionless being moved only
 by the overpowering greed for the gems
 she loved

   watching her in this moment shipman
 resolved to play the game and if possi-
 ble to save her from herself or from
 her other self this very day

   he put no faith whatever in korvos
 rather vague promises korvos belief
 that she was possessed by a devil-quite
 literally-was to him ridiculous

   he did not know what to think what
 to believe this attitude of hostility on
 her part even while she begged a favor
 was beyond understanding

   there from her handbag she ex-
 tracted a chamois pouch loosened its
 draw-strings and from it produced an
 unset stone of some size it was as large
 as his thumb

    i suppose you can see at a glance why
 it interests me and she adcled with
 astonishing malice dont you wish it
 were yours

   shipman gave her a glance no a
 man whose life work lies among gems
 must learn at the outset not to covet-
 not even to own any in fact unless hes a
 millionaire and im not yes i see why
 it interests you it would interest any-
 one

    the stone was an irregular but beauti-
 ful cabochon yet it had never been cut
 or even polished it was one of those
 milky opals found from mexico to mon-
 tana sometimes within the matrix where
 the silica and water have been com-
 pressed this was just as it had come from 
 the matrix one side alive with green
 the other with red iridescence

   further shipman knew this particu-
 lar stone he had seen it in a museum
 in another city when he was studying
 such opals it was on the list of stolen
 gems shown him by the insurance detec-
 tive this girl had stolen it

    but she had not been able to resist the
 temptation to see its wonders revealed
 by the polyandroscope that machine
 which shipman himself had invented

   come along he said quietly and
 turned to the door he knew that the
 chamois pouch in her handbag must hold
 all these precious stones which she had
 stolen his clear duty was to summon the
 detective here and now but he could
 not

 npogether they went into the outer
 a office korvo was not back yet ship-
 man ushered her into the examination
 room last time she had been here she
 had made a frantic effort to save her-
 self as she expressed it now she was
 a totally different person

 the little room with its three chairs
 and the intricate machinery on the
 stand closed out the world marie wil-
 son-he knew her real name now- took
 one of the chairs put her wrap and her
 bag on the center one and lighted a
 cigarette

 shipman made no attempt to explain
 how the iridescent coloring of the stone
 was due to the cracks in the original
 jelly-like substance which now refracted
 the light so variously he saw she want-
 ed no information she wanted her curi-
 osity her avid desire satisfied

 he was curious too and as he placed

 the opal in the central clamp of the ma-
 chine he wondered why it had made
 so tremendous an appeal to her

   he switched off the room lights and
 took the unoccupied chair at the heart
 of the machine was now visible a needle
 of light which grew stronger and more
 intense

   once again shipman wondered wheth-
 er the peculiar visions this girl seemed
 to evoke from certain stones were not
 pure hypnosis induced by this light a
 neat explanation could he accept it but
 he and korvo knew better

   the effect of the polarized light on
 the opal said shipman breaking the
 silence and also of the ultra-violet and
 red rays should be marvelous a lucky
 stone the opal

   i thought it was unlucky came her
 voice still hostile he laughed softly

   no no because one of scotts nov-
 els started that notion its not necessar-
 ily true in fact its been long ago ex-
 ploded and opals are now highly favored
 in england in ancient times the opal
 was held sacred to truth even today
 the occult east believes that it clears the
 brain and that its touch is lucky

   there now its coming up

   often as he had seen the workings of
 this machine its results were ever new
 to him the great hollow glass ball above
 the stone the curved silver reflector
 overhead were suffused with a lovely
 dancing play of colors

   gradually within that sphere grew the
 image of the stone itself enormously
 enlarged but as yet vague in outline

   but the colof it was a riot of flash-
 ing reds and greens shot through with
 living sunlight continually changing as
 the opal was slowly turned the lit-
 tle room was lighted almost brilliantly
 with this prismatic sheen

   stealing a glance at the girl shipman
 saw that she was utterly absorbed fierce-
 ly intent upon that mass of glowing iri-
 descence he caught a startled dila-
 tion of her eyes and looked to see the
 cause

   the glory of light in the glass ball
 rippled and deepened became dotted
 with the yellow smoky glow of many
 lanterns shipman saw them plainly as
 lanterns bluish tobacco smoke twisted
 and twined in them   

 voices rose in a steady roar of sound
 and the duller clink of coins and chips
 men became visible tables for gambling
 heavily crowded voices of women lifted
 in shriller accents a drunken voice
 rose piercingly above the confusion
 hray hray for frisco hray for new
 years day hray for the year 
 a roar of laughter went up hes
 still celebrating thinks its last night
 still

 faces began to grow clear between the
 tables and the bar moved a strolling
 guitar player a mexican he came up
 to a man who leaned against a pillar
 smoking a man with bold eyes and
 aquiline nose-striking vibrant keenly
 alive-and spoke to him softly

 don gaston she will be waiting in
 ten minutes at your office

 at my office diable the other
 started but its night no one is there
 the office is closed

 all the more reason for you to be
 there and open it with a smile and a
 strum of chords the mexican moved
 away don gaston was still staring after
 him when another man came up with
 a hearty greeting and a clap on the
 shoulder

 ha count raousset not tempting the
 goddess this evening
  here was patrice dillon the handsome
energetic french consul in san fran-
cisco and raousset turned to him with
suppressed eagerness

  no im not gambling i heard that
a ship from the south arrived today

  dillon glanced around and spoke in
low rapid french

  yes why didnt you come to my of-
fice

  i didnt get back from sacramento
until this evening

  well youve run freight up to the
mines for the last time said dillon
the reply is here from mexico city
everything is assured our men will pay
over their money at once on the strength
of this youll have five hundred men in
a weeks time

  raoussets face lit up it was the face
of a dreamer a poet a captain of ad-
venture such a face as a young cortez
might have had before age embittered
him he started to speak but dillon
checked him

  not here come to my office at eleven
tomorrow heres a man you must meet
he got in by todays boat danger-
ous 

  a suave pleasant smiling mexican
don pedro yorba dillon introduced the
two of them the three chatted amiably
don pedro was here it seemed to settle
some land disputes with the united
states regarding the vast california
ranches

  raousset found him affable and a good
talker he wore a glorious opal ring an
enormous stone which he himself had
found he said while crossing the desert
some years ago

  as quickly as possible raousset made
his excuses and hurried out of the lucky
strike gambling hall here under the
stars he could give free rein to his
wild exultation

  he had soldiered colonized adven-
tured he had written novels had man-
aged a newspaper now he had come
to california as one among uncounted
thousands-but the only one destined to
become a king

  thus he told himself as he hastened
through the dark sandy filthy streets to
the upstairs loft that he dignified by title
of office

  the guarantees here the money sub-
scribed mexico welcoming him all in
a moment everything had come true-
dreams plans ambitions that steamer
from the south had brought everything
this day raousset blew a kiss to the
lights of the ships in the bay he was
ecstatic overjoyed transfigured he was
actually no longer the same man

mounting the stairs to his office he
hastily got a lamp alight closed the
door of the back room where he lived
and slept and hurriedly brushed up the
room a bit that she should come here
was astonishing but then the dona ynez
did as she pleased and was a law unto
herself

  a refugee from mexico she had opened
a restaurant for latin-americans and
was making money fast in this amaz-
ing melting pot of all nations drawn by
the mad lust for gold it was work or
starve noblemen princes scions of
wealth and genius worked with their
bare hands

  was not count raousset of the bour-
bon line a lighterman plying a freight

	boat to sacramento

  she came a light swift foot upon the
stairs smiling she entered and he
bowed over her hand with formal phras-
es she was slender dark a spanish
mantilla about her head a cloak envelop-

ing her graceful figure her lustrous
eyes widened upon him as she laughed

  you greet me formally don gaston
what courtesy

  i greet you as a queen he said with
dignity and placed a chair for her

gracias she laughed again and seat-
ed herself i needed to see you tonight

i have had word that i may be allowed
to return to mexico that the government
has decided to restore my estates and
you have spoken of going there-

  all that is of small importance now
he brushed aside her words despite
his french ways and gestures there
was a certain simplicity about him a
direct appeal one felt the charm that
never failed him you shall have great-
er estates than your family ever owned
jewels servants wealth power

  she leaned forward puzzled intent
this new air of self-assurance of com-
mand became him well

  something has happened gaston
everything has happened he
laughed suddenly cast off formality
seized her hand and kissed it now i
can speak freely now i can tell you
everything i go to mexico by the next
ship you shall come then youll marry
no laboring man but a child of destiny
tell me she exclaimed and she
added shrewdly only facts gaston no
dreams

  thanks to the aid of dillon count
raousset had only facts to tell

he pointed out to her how the in-
flux of french in california had
met with trouble they the chinese
the latin-americans had been driven
from the gold fields by those of ameri-
can birth they were ready for anything
and he had a project to offer them

  it was no dream but a solid future
he had been a staff officer in algeria
he knew his business mexico had now
agreed to let him head a large number
of french colonists who would come
from california

  he would go to mexico city sign the
necessary papers get the required-and
promised-commission then go back and
meet his first arrivals at guaymas

  they would be armed of course for
protection against the apaches they
were to colonize the fertile valleys of
sonora

  you see he concluded i dillon
one or two others-we alone know the
truth once established we seize guay-
mas and the rest of the sonora coast it
is ours the silver and gold mines are
ours more frenchmen flood in you
shall be queen of sonora

  she caught her breath he was in
sober earnest and his dream was pos-
sible

  and you gaston-a king

  he nodded its not fantastic look
at the mormons in utah their empire is
independent of the united states there
is talk of california becoming independ-
ent as texas was a king has established
himself on the islands in lake michigan
they say he has thousands of followers
and is actually a crowned king so why
not in sonora

  why not indeed mexican rule was
slack a thousand determined french-
men could seize the province american
capital was interested in the scheme the
ultimate aim was still a deep secret
once established the new kingdom
would be recognized by france the
united states was too torn by slavery
troubles to interfere

  it was a glittering shimmering pros-
pect as he talked count raousset
thought of the opal he had seen on don

pedros hand yes his plan was glori-
ous and iridescent as that opal

  the girl kindled to the possibility but
be careful gaston she warned him
when they had discussed the future and
resolved to seek mexico together be
careful san francisco is full of mexican
spies they say all sorts of plans are
afoot here plots and conspiracies and
intrigues some want to seize lower cal-
ifornia others talk of nicaragua spies
have been planted here to send word
of such things to mexico be careful

  raousset gravely assured her that not
six people knew the secret-all of it
then donning hat and coat he escorted
her to her own place it was close by
and if they parted upon a kiss only the
stars saw

  with morning every dream came true
in patrice dillons office the documents
the guarantees the money but before
raousset left dillon cautioned him

  be careful of one person watch the
fellow i introduced you to last night

  don pedro yorba

  precisely hes a mexican agent if
i know anything and that means spy
work

  raousset laughed promised caution
and with a twirl of his moustache went
his way walking on air if ever a man
did he had already sold his boat and a
few cattle he had picked up as a specula-
tion and was in funds the future was
golden

  that night as he stood watching a rou-
lette table in the lucky strike raousset
found don pedro at his elbow they
fell into talk they went to the bar and
drank they went to raoussets office
and there over cigars and a bottle of
wine they talked late and made an
engagement for the morrow

  raousset was wary and knew precisely
what he was doing he liked don pe-
dro however finding him a man much
like himself soldier adventurer gay
blade even a dreamer don pedro
might well be a spy but he was pos-
sessed of a high sense of honor and a
tremendous spanish pride which raous-
set appreciated

  in fact the two men drew close to-
gether during the succeeding days they
were drawn by a mutual liking and ad-
miration so far as his colonizing
schemes went raousset could talk open-
ly of them up to a certain point and did
they were no secret

  he took don pedro up to sacramento
to see the gold diggings discussed col-
onization and apache fighting with-him
and in short did everything except trust
him

when he went to monterey however
only dillon accompanied him they
were gone a week-for raousset a week
of greater import than it seemed at
monterey they met three of the six per-
sons who knew the entire secret

  financial and legal matters were set-
tled transportation to guaymas from
san francisco arms and munitions-a
score of details regarding the practical
side of the expedition were set in order

  raousset was delighted with the busi-
ness-like form everything had taken and
his backers were delighted with him
his magnetism his power of attracting
men was equalled only by his cool com-
mon sense and capability

  so he and dillon rode back to san
francisco they got into the city late
at night and went to the lucky strike
for a bite to eat and a drink and a whirl
of the dice dillon was ever a man for
the tables though raousset was not

  amid the familiar roaring crowd the
      argosy-march 	
haze of tobacco smoke and the click of
chips and coins the two separated
raousset grasped at food and gulped his
wine being weary and hungry a laugh
a strumming twang of chords and the
mexican guitar player at his elbow he
bit at a cigar and nodded amiably to
the man who was paid by the house

  well tomas i just got back it is too
late to see her she is well

  oh quite well sen or quite well but
she has gone away across the bay
eh raousset looked at the man who
was a malignant scarred rascal work-
ing during the day as a dishwasher in the
restaurant of dona ynez gone where
the mexican strummed a note or two
winked and grinned

  to the rancho de las rosas the
hacienda of senor vaca it is a grand
baile a dance she will be back tomor-
row but when the swallows go away
the swifts take their nests eh
raoussets eyes sharpened he knew
what a rogue this fellow was he caught
the undertone of significance in the
drawling peon voice he felt in his
pocket produced a coin and placed it
in the mans hand

  well

  ah caballero i kiss your hands and
feet the other pouched the coin
strummed a chord and grinned again
the excellent don pedro went also
senor adios

  he moved away gracefully his lilting
voice breaking into song leaving raous-
set stricken and agape don pedro yorba

 dioble he exclaimed and puffing
at his cigar he left the place and sought
his dark chill office jealousy seethed and
burst into flame in his soul he had not
discussed ynez with don pedro but now
he intended to discuss don pedro with
her

he did it the following afternoon
haggard and impetuous he picked
her up and took her in a hired carriage
out over the sandy hills and on to the
beach  and had the thing out when
ynez at last divined the cause of his
trouble and suffering she burst into a
trill of silvern laughter and hugged his
arm

  gaston i laugh at your imagination
and i grieve for your needless pain
she pouted deliciously concern in her
eyes denying the laughter in her voice
in two words let me put your anger
to rest i love you i dont love him
oh he is a great caballero he is hand-
some he is wealthy-but what is he to
you

  hes in love with you then

  not particularly he amuses himself
with me she replied maliciously and
privately i amuse myself with him he
is such a fool he thinks that i do not
know he has a wife and three children
in guadalajara

 an angry word escaped raousset
what and he dares to approach you
tut tut she laughed again her
hand warm in his my dear its just his
way let him be and remain satisfied
are you not my divinity shall we not
be in mexico together then forget poor
don pedro i cant prevent his hanging
around me and after all hes rather nice
to talk with when youre gone

  i shant be gone again said raous-
set and kissed her

  and now tell me everything she
urged gayly i have news for you too
ive sold the restaurant and shall turn
it over tomorrow then im free until
the next steamer that goes to guaymas
your steamer gaston

  she chattered of her affairs drifted


around to his and sat enthralled while
he told her what had happened at mon-
terey raousset sketched every detail for
her showed her how nothing was being
left to chance his tremendous relief
his vast happiness filled his heart to
bursting

  in this moment of her love he could
have forgiven the whole world all its
injuries he could almost have forgiven
don pedro his lust-almost but not
quite

  it was not until they were nearly
back to the city with the sun westering
that he noticed the chain around her
neck at his inquiry her slender fingers
went to the gold chain her eyes went
to his face her lips parted breathlessly

  promise me youll not be angry

  why the devil should i be angry
he said laughing

  but promise your word of honor

  certainly all trouble or suspicion
was far from his mind he smiled into
her dark lovely eyes and swore the
oath she desired word of honor my
dear no anger not even one angry
look so lets have the terrible secret
sweet child

  she lifted the chain from her bosom
displaying the pendant that had hitherto
been hidden from sight

  raousset swallowed hard as that flash
of fire met his eyes he recognized the
stone that had been in the ring of don
pedro the glorious milky opal that was
always green on the one side and crim-
son on the other a somber prescience
flashed into his mind

  green and red and white they are
the colors of mexico he said bitterly
well no anger if you accept jewels
from other men i must like it eh

  no it is a loan gaston no more-
the day were married ill return it to
him she declared look how beau-
tiful it is until then let me play with
it

  she was like a child bathing herself
in the iridescence of this gem raousset
was amazed by the wild passion it
aroused in her he had not dreamed that
a woman could be so enthralled by a
mere jewel her promise to return it
mollified his first resentment her naive
delight in the opal her utter abandon
to its hypnotic charm actually pleased
him

  her kisses restored his confidence and
his high spirits and as they drove back
into the sprawling sandhill city he swore
that the queen of sonora should wear
the most wondrous opals in all mexico

  he did not however forget don pe-
dro yorba perhaps she was careful that
he should not forget don pedro for
as she kissed him at parting she laughed
and promised again that she would re-
turn the opal to don pedro before their
marriage

  thus raousset went away with the
thought in his head and that evening
he looked for don pedro and found him
at a monte table in the lucky strike

don pedro was winning he was
playing broad gold pieces and win-
ning fast a whole heap of them before
him a laughing excited crowd was
watching the game

  raousset came and stood behind don
pedro who was not aware of his pres-
ence anger boiled in him at thought
of this handsome caballero trying to
buy the favors of ynez with gems this
man who had left a family in the
south

  then a spark touched the tinder as
someone nearby cracked a jest about
luck at cards meaning no luck at love

and don pedro broke into a gay laugh

  not true in my -case amigo said he
raking in more gold ive found both
cards and ladies very kind to me in
your charming city ive nothing to
complain of

  but perhaps i have said raousset

  don pedro glanced around recognized
him saw the storm of fury in his gaze
and came erect with an astonished oath

it was- checked midway as raousset
struck him across the face he staggered
and recovered

  are you mad raousset he cried
out between amazement and anger

  you damned mexican spy retorted
raousset determined not to bring the
name of ynez into this public brawl
im not insane no but i have a pistol
that will do the talking for me

  so he had and brought it out

  tumult was instant and hasty scatter-
ing of the crowd leaving the two men
alone don pedro beside himself with
rage called for a pistol someone stepped
up with one and the crowd yelled with
glee as don pedro took it

  back to back ten paces and fire
exclaimed a voice reglar duel boys

  raousset and don pedro eyeing one
another exchanged a nod the bartend-
er acted as master of ceremonies amid
the shouts of delight the wagers the
roars of laughter the two men came
back to back and then stepped out the 
bartenders voice counted off the paces

 ten do your damndest and no
scalping

  raousset wheeled at the word he
was  trace ahead of don pedro he
waited deliberately till the other pistol
leveled then squeezed the two shots
roared out as one a drift of powder-
smoke belching and mingling

  raousset felt the hot breath of a bul-
let past his cheek saw don pedro star-
ing wildly through the smoke then the
mexican fell

  they laid him on a table he was
dying raousset gloomily looked down
and met those brilliant handsome eyes

  spy mexican spy murmured don
pedro no not i im not the spy
but-

  his head lolled and the life went out
of him

 the crowd roared around count
raousset cruelly delighted only a
frenchy killing a greaser went up the
word no matter no matter it was all
done fair and aboveboard and no blame
to anyone

raousset pushed his way out of the
throng and into the night air what
had don pedro meant by those last
words he pondered them vainly frown-
ingly intently he could find no mean-
ing whatever in them yet that parting
gasp of life must have had a deep and
terrible message had it not been cut
short the thought fascinated raous-
set

  don pedro had been trying desperately
to tell him something as he lay dying
on that table

  those unfinished words lingered with
raousset in the days that followed again
and again he studied them pored over
them tried to discover what was in
them

  and in the end he did discover their
meaning

  this discovery came to him in the
whitewashed cell at guaymas when the
guards laughed at him and taunted
him and told him of the woman who
greeted her lovers with a chain and
a dangling jewel of fire lit by the flames
of hell
  he had learned now that dona ynez
loved not him alone but had loved
many and would love many more in
her gainsome trade

  and the unfinished speech of don
pedro was made clear to him on the
white beach at guaymas in the early
sunrise when he smiled and faced the
leveled rifles no not i the voice
of don pedro seemed to whisper the
words to him now im not the spy but
she is dona ynez the spy for mexico
who lured and tricked you-

  the rifles crashed so raousset learned
everything and smiled in the glory of
the sunrise and died like the king he
might have been   

all the scene faded out save only
that sun-smitten glory lingering in
the room that was lit by the glittering
shimmering iridescence of the opal

  shipipan started those scenes had been
vivid and real flashing before him like
the flashing vivid hues of the stone now
he was plummeted back to reality

  dona ynez sat beside him her eyes
wide upon the glinting lights still utter-
ly absorbed in them the same dusky
lovely features the same slim feline
grace-and today for the first time the
same hint of cruelty and bewitching
power and deception as if in her lurked
the same devil who had lurked in that
other woman of old san francisco

  shipman touched the switches the
glowing crystal sphere before them slow-
ly waned and paled until only the nee-
dle-point of light remained in the ma-
chine then this too perished he came
to his feet

  i hope you recognized her he said
bitterly to conceal his own tension she
only laughed a little upon the dark-
ness

  he switched on the light went to the
polyandroscope took the opal from the
clamp and dropped the stone into his
pocket he turned and met her flash-
ing eyes

  my opal please she exclaimed

  she was standing now slim and straight
and lovely and the strange fire in her
eyes seemed to flame brighter she was
beautiful and terrible

  no i cant give it to you marie wil-
son its not yours he said gravely
steadily im returning it to the own-
ers this is only my barest duty be-
lieve me i should hand you over as a
thief i cant do that i still believe in
you god help me i still hope that we
can help you cure you-

  but her swift passionate gesture
stopped him she stepped closer to him

  damn your hopes she burst out
furiously he was thankful that the
room was sound-proofed as her voice
shrilled give me that opal give it

to me this is a trick a trap hand
it over and stop your mawkish talk give
it to me or ill kill you

  yes l think you would-if you
could he said her words her look
her action all gave him a heart-break-
ing sense of defeat ive knocked
around the world too much to be im-
pressed

  he had to prove those words for she
struck like a flash of light without warn-
ing he caught the glitter of a knife
and then he had her in both hands

  a man who trades in jewels had best
learn all the answers and shipman had
learned them long ago by shore and sea
he was even more active than she and a
wild cry of pain broke from her as she
found herself helpless in his grip

  he had meant to push matters and
give her a lesson a frightful one but
he could not do it the pain in her
voice the agony he was causing her
the love that he bore her were too much
for him

  the little knife fell to the floor his
grip relaxed she caught her breath
dived for her wrap and handbag and
then was gone

shipman removed the opal from the
machine went into his own office
and slumped into his chair before the
desk he was still sitting there twenty
minutes later when korvo walked in

  hello they tell me shes been here
again damned bad luck i missed her

  he came forward and pulled up a
chair holding a twist of paper up then
pocketing it

  whats that demanded shipman

  korvo smiled gravely

  thats the trap for the devil thats in
her next time she comes well tell me
what happened

  shipman forced himself to comply the
recital graved bitter lines in that lean
face of his the recollection of her words
and manner hurt deeply but when he
had done korvo leaned forward and
spoke earnestly

  chief ive been informing myself from
people who do believe in demoniacal pos-
session and what youve just told me
proves my whole theory the way she
acted today-dont you see shes been
trying to rid herself of the thing the
devil whos in her is furious at you its
your influence thats fighting him

  thats why she spoke as she did today
-not she but the elemental within her
and they tell me these elementals arent
very hard beings to exorcise

  shipman leaned back and began to
laugh

  korvo im damned if i feel like laugh-
ing but i cant help it the way you
talk about this devil as if he were a
dog under the table a real creature like

all tragedy the damned thing has its
comic side

  im not asking you to believe any-
thing replied korvo but next time
she comes let me handle her

  agreed said shipman i dont
think shell be back though

  i do korvo was confident and
tapped his waistcoat pocket when i
put this thing in the window shell be
in to see it never fear

  -what is it then

  never you mind chief ill confide
in you when im ready to bait the trap
why this very story about the gold rush
days about count roausset-dont you
see how that bears out my theory were
seeing-or rather you are-various pic-
tures from the past not of your girl
friend but of the devil thats in her
scenes from other lives of that devil-
oh forget the whole thing will you
broke in shipman i just cant make
myself swallow this devil stuff dont
force it down my throat

  very well assented korvo cheerful-
ly hello is that the opal

  he leaned forward as if to pick up
the opal that lay on shipmans desk
then he checked himself he was look-
ing at something else lying there by the
opal a chamois pouch whose draw-
strings were knotted tight

  chief is that-can it be-

  its the pouch with all her stolen
stones in it said shipman grimly

  good lord you mean she gave it
to you

  not by a damned sight i slipped it
out of her handbag while the show was
on

  korvo whistled good work chief
good work shell be back tomorrow
sure now youve got her shell be back
to beg borrow or steal those gems
no shipman dissented stonily
theyre going to that insurance detec-
tive at once now dont you see man
its all i can do for her-get her immuni-
ty ill tell a fine story the detective
doesnt want her pinched anyway hell
get back these stones that means hell
give up and let her alone

  and shell start in stealing stones all
over again

  damn it cried out shipman his
voice tortured what else can i do
you might have some faith in what
i say replied korvo quietly after all
chief there are a lot of people and sects
and religions in this world who do be-
lieve in devils

  shipman looked at him with hard
bitter eyes for a long moment

  all right he said abruptly youre
the doctor but if you fail-

  then shes no worse off nor are you
agreed

  agreed said shipman

many never suspect
             cause of backaches

this old treatment often brings happy relief

nights swelling pufflness under the eyes headaches and dizzi-
ness frequent or scanty passages with smarting and burning
sometimes shows there is something wrong with your kidneys
or bladder

dont wait ask your druggist for doans pills used suc-
cessfully by millions for over io years they give happy relief
and will help the  miles of kidney tubes flush out poisonous
waste from your blood get doans pills	adv

  many sufferers relieve nagging backache quickly once they
discover that the real cause of their trouble may be tired
kidneys

  the kidneys are natures chief way of taking the excess
acids and waste out of the blood they help most people pass
about  pints a day

  when disorder of kidney function permits poisonous matter
to remain in your blood it may cause nagging backache
rheumatic pains leg pains loss of pep and energy getting up

by arthur leo zagat

start now this exciting story of
dikars journey toward freedom

it is a dark time for america with her
land held by an alien tyrant and her
people enslaved but now each day the army
of rebellion grows stronger led by norman
fenton president of america this army has
marched to the foot of the great smokies
the plan is to surprise and vanquish yee
hashamotos asafric army

only dikar suspects that the asafrics have
arranged a trap

his suspicion is borne out with terrible
effect suddenly the sky is black with asafric
planes the bombs rain down on the trapped
american army after the endless moments of
terror dikar and marilee arise from their
hiding place to find that the havoc though
tragic has not been disastrous and now
walt bennet comes to dikar with a request
from president norman fenton

the heavy guns of the asafrics are em-
placed on the mountain slopes command-
ing this valley where the americans are
camped in one spot called newfound gap a
nest of lighter guns-archies-is situated and
if the americans can capture this stronghold
they will be able to make short work of the
other asafric fortifications

only the agile mountain-trained bunch
would have the slightest chance of scaling the
cliffs of newfound gap and the odds are a
thousand to one against their succeeding so
norman fenton asks rather than commands
that they undertake the perilous assault

to a man the bunch agree to make the
attempt so dikar leads them up the
bare steep mountainside where the least
sound will betray their presence to the asafric
soldiers at last they reach the gap they
charge the black soldiers and the battle is
savage

dikar having maneuvered an archie into
position blows the asafric headquarters to
fragments and so concludes the fight but
then with victory in his hands hp topples
suddenly from his gun-seat to fall into black-
ness

chapter v

monument between battles

the earth was springy under di-
kars running feet and its coolness
was good to feel the woods smells
-the brown smell of the earth the green
smell of brush and leaves-were good in
dikars nostrils best of all was the
silver happy sound of marilees laugh-
ter as she ran from him hid just ahead
by a green tangle of brush

  all of a sudden marilees laughter end-
ed

  dikar broke through the green cur-
tain that hid marilee he stopped short
the brush had been cleared away here
so that he could see farther through the
gray-brown tree-trunks than marilee
could have run but there was no mar-
ilee to be seen not even the press of her
feet on the moss

dikar stood very still a muscle



this story began in last weeks argosy
twitching in his cheek a line of ex-
citcd ants hurried through the moss near
his feet each carrying a white egg in
its strong jaws a green snake slid
lithely out from behind a gnarled elbow
of root its tiny black eyes bright in its
three-cornered flat head a bump on a
stone was a warty toad so still that it
might be dead a fly flitted too near it
and the toads tongue flicked out of in
again to its wide ugly mouth the fly
was gone

  over dikars head a squirrel chrrred
scolding dikar grinned and his knees
bent straightened to send him flying
upward his hands upflung caught an
oaks sturdy bough his feet found hold
on the bough dikar stood erect was
climbing the swaying ladder of leafy
branches quick and sure as any squirrel
in the green heart of the tree marilee
was curled on a branching fork her
gray eyes dancing

  her hair was a silken glory about her
but only her skirt of plaited grasses her
breast-circlets of woven flowers covered
her brown loveliness legs astraddle on
a bough beneath dikar plucked his mate
from her perch and held her arm-cra-
dled over empty space

  im going to drop you he growled
deep in his chest for thinkin you could
get away from me hey let go my
beard -

  she only pulled its golden hairs hard-
er as she laughed fins dikar cried
fins i wont drop you he settled
down in the fork where she had been
held marilee nestling against him

  oh dikar marilees voice lifted
with happiness you jumped up here
like youd never been hurt youre all
well again dikar

  didnt i tell you i was

  yes you did but i couldnt believe
it i kept thinkin how the doctor said
when you were carried down here to
norrisdam a month ago that you would-
nt even be able to walk till the end
of the summer

  aw what do those fool doctors
know we got along pretty good with-
out em all the time we lived on our
mountain didnt we they dont know
anythin

  silly marilee frowned doctors
are awful smart they know a lot-
but they dont know as much as
you do about the roots and grasses that
heal hurts if it hadnt been for you
id be still layin on that bed

  ill never forget how you looked all
bloody and torn with the asafric bul-
lets-

  that first week must have been a
bad time for you im sorry you had
such a bad time on account of me he
gathered her closer to him let me
show you how sorry i am marilee
marilee he bent his face to hers

for a long time she would not un-
twine her arms from around him
but at last she let him put her on the
bough beside him he leaned back
against the bark of the tree and she nes-
tled close against him

  ah marilee sighed eyelids drooped
moist-red lips wistful this is grand
just you an me alone together its like
we were back in our tree on the tiptop
of the mountain lookin out at the
far land an wonderin what was there
a shadow stole over dikars face
maybe i shouldnt ever have led the
bunch down off the mountain this was
the thought that had been bothering him
maybe i was wrong to do that look
marilee if i hadnt little carlberger
would be alive today an louvance an-

  an normanfenton would be skin an
bones dried by the wind dikar hangin
in chains from the top of the empire
state buildin in new york marilee
pulled a leaf from a twig walt would
still be a beast man dirty an starvin in
the woods below our mountain or may-
be the asafrics would have caught him
an put him in one of their cages in
which a man can neither stand up nor
sit nor lie down

  johndawson- oh you know as well
as i do that if you had not led the bunch
off the mountain there would not be
anyone fightin to make america free
we were free on our mountain mar-
ilee we lived our own happy life there
an nobody bothered us

  yes marilee pulled little bits from
the leaf let them flutter from long slim
fingers yes dikar we were free we
were happy we could not hear the whips
of the asafrics on the backs of white
men an women we could not see the
people herded in filth an sufferin inside
the barbed wire of the concentration
camps

  we were not bein driven by the guns
an the kicks of the blacks to slave
in factories an mines makin things not
for ourselves but our masters all of
those things and lots more lots worse
were happenin in the far land but on
our mountain we lived the good life
we earned it marilee we worked
hard for it all the years since the old
ones brought us to the mountain

  an gave us the musts an must-nots
the law by which we should live hap-
py-then died so that we could live free
when the asafric soldiers came to the
mountain the old ones did not run
away an hide in the woods did they
they went down off the mountain to
meet the asafrics they gave their lives
gladly

  the old ones had heard the voice
she went on that you yourself told me
about in our tree on the tiptop of the
mountain they had heard the voice
that came into a dark place under the
ground where mothers huddled their lit-
tle children to them while the thunder
of bombs humbled overhead theyd
heard it sayin in these little children
lies americas last faint hope of-of a- 
marilee hesitated looked at dikar her
brows knitting

   of a tomorrow  dikar helped her
 when democracy liberty freedom 
all of a sudden his voice was clear and
certain shall reconquer the green an
pleasant fields that tonight lie devastat-
ed 

ou do remember marilees face
 was alight again you do remem-
ber the voice you heard a long time ago
in a dream you have not forgotten it
you have made me remember it my
sweet dikar knew now why marilee
had brought him up here into this tree
that was so like the tree where hed
told her first of all the bunch about
his dream and the voice in it i had
forgotten this morning when for the
first time since clingmans dome i came
to brekfes with the bunch an looked
around the table what i saw made me
forget my dream

  what you saw

  dikars hands closed into fists so tight
their knuckles whitened eight boys
only marilee are left of the twenty-six
i led down off the mountain nine count-
in myself the rest are dead an buried
there was a smile on franksmiths
face when we buried him dikar his
body was all torn with the asafrics bul-
lets but there was a happy peaceful

smile on his face you know there was

  there was no smile on bessaltons
face this mornin there was no light
in her eyes she sat there white an
silent an if alicekane had not kept
after her she would not have eaten a
bite

  there are smiles dikar on the faces
of hundreds and hundreds of women all
across this land they have hope now
but they would not have it if you had
not led franksmith an bessalton an all
the rest of the bunch down from the
mountain did you do wrong dikar
when you did that

  no marilee i did right i did-

  dikar broke off and his head canted
listening to a call from somewhere be-
low helloooo helloooo dikar it was
coming nearer dikar where are you
helloooo

  dikar dropped down to the trees low-
est bough pushed aside leaves from his
face here nedsmall bushes were
threshing down there here i am
the toad hopped from his stone and
the green snake flicked back behind its
elbow of root what is it what do
you want

  the bushes parted and nedsmall came
into sight oh dikar he looked up
and sunbeams danced on his freckle-
dusted impish face i been lookin all
over for you he was the smallest of
the boys walt sent word youre want-
ed at headquarters youre to meet him
on top of the dam in half an hour
dikars wanted at headquarters
marilee was alongside dikar on the
bough the two standing there without
using their hands to hold on comfort-
able as if on the ground what for
i wasnt told nedsmall shrugged
but i know what i hope he looked
excited im tired hangin around here
doin nothin i hope they got another
job for us to do

  dikar heard marilees breath pull in
all right nedsmall he said thanks
for tellin me he watched the young-
ster run off

  so soon marilee whispered oh
dikar why couldnt they let me have
you for myself a little while longer
dikar smiled at her but there was no
smile in his blue eyes you could
have had me all for yourself all the time
if wed stayed on the mountain but
i seem to remember your sayin that it
would have been wrong for us to have
stayed there

  i said that marilee laid her little
hand on dikars arm and her fingers
were icy cold trembling an i meant
it i was talkin to the boss of the
bunch then just njw im thinkin about
my mate	

chapter vi

look on my work   

norrisdam was a white stone wall
that men had built joining one great
hill to another its top was wide enough
for ten men to walk abreast and its bot-
tom was so far below the top that men
down there looked no bigger to dikar
than his thumb

  that was on one side on the other
side was water a great lake of water
stretching back between green forested
hills as far as dikar could see the
lake is as deep as the dam is high
walt told dikar as they walked along
the top of the dam but before the
dam was built there was only a little
muddy river way down there on what
is now the lakes bottom

why was this dam built dikar


asked why did they make the lake
here

   because the farm lands of eight states
from the mountains of virginia to the
ohio river were being washed away
by the spring floods and in the summer
what soils the floods had not washed away
was cracked and thirsty with drought
the crops yellow and dying

   so engineers built this dam and others
lljce it it was a great thing they did
dikar they harnessed the floods and
the storms and gave the people of these
states fertile fields and cheap power
they gave the people a better life

   men built mountains like this di-
kars forehead was wrinkled his eyes
puzzled so that they could have a bet-
ter life

   exactly

  they were smart enough an strong
enough to do that dikar said as if to
himself he stared at walt then why
couldntthey keep hold of the mountains
they built why couldnt they go on
making their life bettef and better what
happened to them

   walt shrugged with a bitter smile i
dont know he said the men who
built the mountains were engineers but
the men who had the job of making the
better life work and keep on working-
they were statesmen he started walk-
ing faster we havent got time to talk
about that now dikar general fentons
waiting for us

  they came to the end of the road
along the dams top and hurried across
a wide stone-paved field where hundreds
of men in gray-blue uniforms were
lounged dikar was thinking that maybe
if people had taken time to talk about
things like this before it was too late
things would be different now but he
didnt say the thought aloud because
they were going into the stone building
that was called headquarters here at
norrigdam

normanfenton stood looking out
of a high round-topped window
when walt and dikar came into his room
he seemed thinner than the last time
dikar had seen him at wespoint but he
was still very tall and his long legs and
long arms still looked as if theyd been
hitched on to his body in a hurry and
not very carefully

  but when normanfenton turned and
dikar saw his face once more dikar for-
got how clumsy his body was

   his great head with its gray-threaded
straggly black beard seemed somehow
too big for that ungainly body gaunt
cheeks were molded by bones very near
the surface of the skin and the skin was
scribbled over with a tracery of wrinkles
fine as the threads of a spider-web un-
der a broad and thoughtful forehead
eyes were deep-sunken and somber

   in normanfentons eyes was pain and
a dreadful tiredness but in them there
was also the soft light of a vision seen
far off seeing dikar he smiled and
his whole face seemed to brighten with
a warm and tender welcome

   ah my boy his voice was not very
loud but it seemed to fill the big room
as he held out a gnarled hand to take
dikars strong brown one i have not
had the opportunity yet to thank you
for what you and your-bunch did up
there on the roof of the smokies

  i-uh- dikar swallowed shifted
from one foot to the other it was noth-
ing norman-mr president he re-
membered just in time how he was sup-
posed to talk to normanfenton any-
body could have done the same thing
i dont agree perhaps others might



have had the same will and courage but
you possess certain unique skills that
none without your peculiar background
can match and it is of those particular
skills that we have need again or i should
not have sent for you as soon as i heard
that you had recovered from your
wounds

  what job do you want me to do
dikar asked tell me

  the warm smile flickered in norman-
fentons eyes and then faded captain
bennet he looked at walt will you
be good enough to send the guard out-
side beyond earshot and remain at the
door yourself so that we can be abso-
lutely certain there are no eavesdrop-
per

   walt saluted and obeyed

  whn we were on the mountain to-
gether dikar said the president turn-
ing to him again i think i taught you
something about maps am i right
yes you taught me a little then an
walt-capn bennet-has taught me a lot
more since

  good that will make my explanation
easier look here normanfenton took
dikars arm led him to the wall to the
left of the window this is a map of
the southern quarter- of the united states
mexico and central america

   it was a bigger map than any dikar had
ever seen and he thought it a shame
someone had stuck a lot of different col-
ored pins into it i didnt think we
would be concerned with that region for
a long time yet normanfenton went on
but ive had some news this morning-
he stopped sighed his fingers tight-
ened on dikars arm bad news dikar
danger threatens our cause a graver
danger than ever before

   normanfenton put his forefinger on the
map im going to send you down there
my boy it will be a miracle if you can
get there it will be a miracle if you can
accomplish what im sending you to do
but the cause of freedom can be saved
only by a miracle now

it was very quiet in the room so quiet
that as normanfenton stopped talking
for a minute dikar could hear the rus-
tling of the ivy that grew thick on the
wall outside the lap lap of the lakes
waters close to the bottom of that wall

   and the slow throb of the blood in his
ears

  only by a miracle normanfenton
sighed and so very many things can
happen to prevent you from working that
miracle if what im going to tell you
should leak out to the enemy- the look
of pain deepened in his face we must
take every precaution that it shall not
you must repeat what you are about to
hear to no one dikar not even to that
lovely wife of yours do you under-
stand

  i understand dikar said through
cold lips but he didnt he was wonder-
ing why normanfenton didnt want him
to tell marilee

   not that i dont trust her as much as
i do you but a single inadvertent remark
-there are spies in camp here my boy
the look of pain deepened on the lead-
ers face matters have reached the ene-
my that only someone on my personal
staff could have known this matter must
not

  he turned abruptly to the map now
thats understood ill explain what its
all about first perhaps i had better tell
you how things stand now

  dikar moved to the other side of the
president so that he could see better

  after we took newfound gap nor-
manfenton began we- dikar whirled
away from him face suddenly white

he bounded to the window leaned out

   hed heard from outside here a sud-
den gasp quickly cut off and a threshing
of leaves someone clinging to the vine
to listen had missed his hold and grabbed
for a better one to save himself from
falling

   he hadnt saved himself there was a
splash from the water below dikar saw
a blurred form deep under the lakes sur-
face then he had vaulted the sill and
he was plunging down into the icy waters
of norris lake

      inspiredby the manner in which
dikar and his bunch had at fearful cost
used their woodland skills to breach the
asafrics mountain breastworks and made
possible the union of the two branches
of his eastern army across the tennes-
see valley general norman fenton re-
solved to attempt a similar junction be-
tween these forces and the rebel amer-
icans who had gained virtual control of
the central mid-west

   to this ambitious project viceroy yee
hashamotos gunboat patrol of the mis-
sissippi interposed a formidable obstacle
following the pattern of the tactics by
which the great uprising had grown from
a mere rioting of a few disaffected slaves
to the dignity of a major insurrection
president fenton initiated simultaneous
feints-in-force toward chicago and new
orleans contriving through patriots pos-
ing as renegade mudskins to get word of
these to hashamoto

   the latter at once concentrated his
strength on the threatened cities setting
up traps like the one at the great smoky
mountains that the americans had es-
caped only through dikars brilliant ex-
ploit

   on may rd-th fenton delivered
his genuine assault against the weakened
forces that had been left to hold cairo
illinois and its vicinity his stratagem was
completely successful the mississippi
was crossed and penetration of the ozark
plateau from the bridgehead thus estab-
lished

   in the face of these repeated defeats
yee hashamoto still sedulously concealed
from the asiatic-african confederations
supreme command at home any knowl-
edge that he was in difficulty to explain
why we must refer back to chapter ii
of this history

   the reader will recall that here we dis-
cussed the characteristics that so well
fitted the leaders of the asafric cabal for
the program of world conquest on which
they embarked when axis diplomacy
having invited them as allies into the
arena of welt politik revealed to them
the rotten beams behind the facade of
vaunted white supremacy we also point-
ed out a psychological weakness the
oriental preoccupation with face

hashamoto had only to draw upon
the confederations tremendous mil-
itary resources to crush the american
uprising even now but by so doing he
must admit his own failure he must
admit that a slave whom he had paraded
through the countryside naked and in
chains had out-maneuvered out-gener-
aled him he would lose face this
was unthinkable

   it was also inevitable unless he took
strong measures at once there were in-
creasingly urgent demands from across
the pacific for explanation of why the
flow of cargoes from his bailiwick was
so materially dwindling and the viceroy
was running out of excuses with each
victory the numbers of the insurrection-
ists were growing as liberated slaves
flocked to their standards he could not
very much longer keep his secret

  from this dilemma hashainoto saw
one means of escape the asafrics first
incursion into the western hemisphere
had been by way of south america that
continent was still docile hashamoto
had two tank divisions guarding the
panama canal but no threat thene was
possible

  they were the reinforcements he need-
ed all he had to do was bring one of
those divisions up through central amer-
ica and mexico using texas as a spring-
board they could strike the americans
on their exposed southern flank drive
north through the central plain and
then facing westward herd the insur-
rectionists toward the rockies

  in the latter range would be waiting
the west coast troops that had so far
maintained undisputed control over cali-
fornia and the columbia river valley
caught between two fires a full half of
fentons forces would be destroyed

  meanwhile relieved of concern with
the prairies hashamotos present con-
tingents would be equal to the task of
annihilating the remaining rebels

  viceroy yee hashamotos wireless
flashed the orders perhaps he was not
aware that the americans could intercept
and decode the message perhaps he did
not care it was a good plan and even
if general norman fenton in his head-
quarters at norris dam knew about it
he was helpless to defeat it   



tts a good plan-there was deep
a worry in normanfentons voice-
that of hashamotos dikar shivered
a little  the fawnskin draped over his
left shoulder and around his brown
strong body was still chilly-wet from the
lake though hed been listening so long
that the water had dried from his thighs
and his legs

   we will be helpless against his tanks
once they reach texas here the gen-
erals bony finger rested on the map just
above where the blue that meant water
took a big bite out of the bottom of the
united states theyve got to be stopped
before they get this far and thats what
im putting up to you

  to me dikar gasped how can i
stop em

   dikar could swim like a fish but hed
been blinded by the splash of his own
wild dive out of the window and before
he could see again the spy who had been
listening under it had swum too far un-
der water to be seen

  my only hope son normanfenton
answered him that they can be stopped
rests on you

  the funny thing was that though some
of the boys and girls of the bunch had
been in swimming where the woods came
down to the shore on the other side of
norris lake none of them had seen any
stranger come up out of it dikar had
sent the bunch to see if they could pick
up the spys trail and had returned to
normanfenton

  now he said but normanfenton how
do we have any chance of stoppin two
divisions of asafrics theres only nine
boys left in the bunch-

  i said you my boy not your bunch
what has to be done can be done by you
alor e or it cannot be done at all

  the listener could have heard only
that normanfenton was going to send
dikar somewhere that must be kept a

secret even from marilee and now there
were soldiers in a little boat out on the
lake to make sure no one climbed the ivy
again

  why should anything be easier for me
to do alone than with help dikar asked

  please stop breaking in on me like
that young man normanfentons tired
smile took away the hurt of the sharp
words give me a chance to explain one
man can do what is to be done as well
as nine or ninety

  to get to where i am sending you
you will have to steal through the ene-
mys lines through six hundred miles of
territory held and patrolled by his troops
capture will mean a particularly horrible
death for you for me the end of my last
hope of checkmating hashamoto

  you will need every atom of your skill
in moving silently and unseen and any
companion you take with you would only
increase your peril

  all right dikar shrugged where
am i goin an what am i to do there
normanfenton turned back to the map
you see how mexico and then central
america narrow his finger moved
downward on the many-colored sheet
pinned to the wall curving around the
gulf of mexico to here where the
panama canal cuts through it

  the panama-thats where the tanks
are comin from

  thats where they will be coming
from according to the messages weve
intercepted about three or four weeks
from now

  three or four weeks what are they
waitin for

tvvisions of tanks cannot move at

-	a moments notice my boy like
your bunch theyve got to accumulate
supplies of fuel munitions food to sus-
tain them on the march their machinery
must be repaired put in perfect order

  there are innumerable details to be
taken care of to prepare them for a long
campaign even more than usual for these
divisions which have been somewhat dis-
organized by their idleness and all this
dikar must be done surreptitiously lest
the officers of vessels passing through the
canal observe the unusual activity and
report it to the asafric supreme com-
mand

  viceroy hashamoto fears his own
home government more than he does us
normanfenton sighed and rightly
but if its goin to take em so long to
get started an we already know what
theyre up to couldnt we get ready in
that time to meet an fight em

  meet them where they will have all
texas to spread out over and we have
no way of anticipating where they will
choose to strike fight them how

  in a battle of movement tanks can be
fought only by tanks dikar and we have
none we have nothing that would give
us the slightest chance against them un-
less-an thats the whole crux of my plan
-unless they can be taken by surprise
unprepared for action their crews un-
suspecting an enemy anywhere near

  now the general went on all of
this isthmus except for some narrow
stretches along its coast and along a few
short unconnected stretches of railway
remains pretty much the same as it was
when columbus first saw it

  where the sierra madre range does
not thrust its crags to the sky a thick
and well-nigh impenetrable tropic growth
bars travel there is only one practicable
route by which it can be traversed the
pan-american highway a broad con-
crete road that was completed just a year
before the invasion since hashamoto
does not dare requisition transports to

convey his tanks by water that is the
way they must come

  normanfentons finger started moving
back up on the map this way dikar
skirting the inward base of the moun-
tains that join the andes to the rockies
through costa rica nicaragua hon-
duras

  and here the finger paused just be-
fore it would have crossed a line that
zig-zagged across the picture of narrow
land the colors different each side of it
as they approach gautemalas mexican
border is where they must be stopped
if theyre to be stopped anywhere
why there dikar goggled why
just where the lands widest of all
beside where the generals finger rested
a kind of bump stuck out into the water-
blue i-i cant make out why you
should pick that place

  im picking it precisely because the
land is widest here because here the
highway passes along the base of the
yucatan peninsula normanfenton point-
ed to the big bump wilderness as the
rest of the isthmus is it is a tamed gen-
tle region compared to the primordial
jungle of yucatan and son when the
asafric hordes overran texas and louisi-
ana and mississippi a large number of
americans fled across the gulf of mexico
to this green hell in yucatan

  many of the boats that carried them
were sunk by the guns of the enemy fleet
many were wrecked by a hurricane but
some reached the shores of yucatan and
campeche and quintana roo and their
passengers found sanctuary in the in-
terior

  what became of them we do not know
the sisal that was yucatans only crop
was of no use to the asafric and so they
did not bother to conquer that region
the underground wireless of the secret
net never received a response from that
green mystery the jungle swallowed the
refugees they vanished

dikar scratched his head ygu dont
know how many there are you
dont know if theyre still alive in there
you dont know anythin about them
but you expect-

  i know this about them norman-
fenton broke in i know that they were
americans once and that whatever they
have become whatever the jungle has
done to them if they still live they are
still americans

  im gambling on that dikar im gam-
bling my hopes that the cause i lead
may still be saved if you can reach them
and tell them that their countrymen are
fighting for freedom and are in danger
theyll come out of their jungles
when the asafric tanks pass by-

  and stop them a thrill came into
normanfentons deep voice and as he
turned to dikar he seemed suddenly
taller in his faded gray-blue uniform
stop them dead there in the shadow of
the sierra madre unless they do we
fail i cannot believe god means to let
us fail i cannot believe that needing a
miracle now he will not help us work
that miracle

  he spread wide his gnarled hands bony
and bulging with an old mans net of
veins under yellowing transparent skin
i send you alone on a long long road
dikar every inch of which will be fraught
with peril of death for you

  i send you into a steamy jungle to find
men who for all i know may have turned
into savages i send you to ask them
for the sake of an ideal which almost
surely they have forgotten to attack
trained soldiers who have conquered the
world

  by all the laws of reason it is a mad


 project foredoomed to failure i put my
 faith in that god who created men to be
 free that it will succeed and it must

      dikar walked slowly back across
 the top of norrisdam the hushed gray
 of dusk sifting down through the tree-
 clad hills to veil the lake with darkling
 mist was answered by a gray hush within
 him

   dikars eyes burned with long looking
 at the maps that normanfenton had
 showed him hundreds of maps picturing
 every yard of the way he was to go
 dikars head throbbed full to bursting
 with all that normanfenton had told him
 with all the hundreds of things dikar
 must not forget

   dikars heart ached with knowing that
 tonight for the first time since he could
 remember he must leave marilee with-
 out telling her where he was going

   tonight he was going to leave the
 bunch that hed been boss of so long
 without a word of goodbye he was going
 to slip away into the dark and he had as
 much hope of coming back to them as-
 as this twig shooting over the dams spill-
 way and down into the foaming flood
 below had of ever going back up the
 river to the woods

   like that twig dikar was being car-
 ried along by a rushing river far and far
 from the woods hed loved far from the
 mountain that was his home

 rro dikars left and right along the
 a sides of the clearing into which hed
 come were the little houses that walt had
 called log-cabins when hed brought the
 bunch here to show them where they
 were to live at the other end a great
 fire sent its leaping orange light up into
 the spreading branches of a tall oak

   down the middle of the open space a
 long table ran the girls bustling around
 it as they set it for supper the firelight
 danced on the girls smooth brown arms
 on the thighs peeping briefly through the
 lustrous cloaks of their hair almost as
 tall as dikar but black-haired and
 bearded johnstone talked with alfoster
 nearer the fire patmara and abestein
 and henfield threw little stones at a
 mark they had blazed on the oak

   the clearing was filled with happy
 laughter friendly chatter but beyond the
 fire the woods were black and the sun-
 set wind made a rushing sound in the
 treetops

   dikar

   marilee had seen him she was coming
 toward him her hands held out to him
 her body slim and straight every grace-
 ful line of her every movement was a
 song swelling in dikars throat an ache
 in his arms

   as dikar waited for marilee the fire
 flared and he saw another girl who stood
 very still in the shadows her form was
 slim and straight as marilees but the
 long fall of hair that robed it was a lus-
 terless black her eyes seemed to watch
 marilee but there was no life in them
 her hands hung empty half open as
 though something very dear had spilled
 from them and was gone forever

 bessalton

 the wind in the treetops made a rush-
 ing sound like that of a wide dark river
 flowing from here into the far and lonely
 night

chapter viii

no farewell

 tt was very dark in the cabin so dark
 - that dikar could not see marilee at all
 though he could feel her warm soft body
 close against his smell the clean fresh
 sweetness of her hear the whisper of her

 

 long tired breathing that told him she
 was deep in sleep at last

 hed waited a long time staring aching-
 eyed into the dark till he couldbe cer-
 tain that she slept now very carefully
 he slid his arm from under her and
 slipped from the bed and she did not stir

 dikars heart was very heavy but his
 feet were light and silent as he felt for
 and found the apron of twigs marilee had
 plaited for him on their mountain he
 tied it around him fastened to its belt
 his knife in the sheath marilee had made
 for him out of the skin of a deer these
 were the only things dikar took with him
 from the cabin these-and the memory
 of marilee

 dikar saw nothing of the dark woods
 as he went down through them he heard
 nothing of the uncountable little voices of
 the woods he went down through them
 silent as any creature that prowls the
 sunless hours but only because he could
 not move through the woods in any other
 way not because he gave thought to what
 he was doing

 hed shut out thought because if he
 thought what he was doing he could not
 do it at all

 a sound of voices stopped him at the
 bottom of the wooded hill

 dikar crouched just within the bushes
 that ended the woods peered out at the
 road that crossed the top of norrisdam
 and then went around this hill and away
 the voices came from the black bulk of
 a big covered truck that loomed out there
 against the lakes paler glimmer

 dikar rounded his mouth and made the
 sound of a hoot-owl

 whats idea startin us out this
 time uh night one of the voices
 grumbled without us even knowin what
 were carryin or where were goin
 dikar could see other trucks standing
 on the road there were five of them
 and this was the middle one you think
 theyre gonna tell you another hoarse
 voice said yer in the army now car-
 son yer not behin th plow

  plow hell i was runnin a loom over
 to sweetwater before i joined up with
 a big black crackin a bull-whip across
 my back every time a thread got snarled
 first thing i did when i heard our boys
 come a-whoopin inter town i grabbed
 thet whip out of his han an spattered
 his brains all over the floor with its butt
 whatre yeh crabbin about then
 whos crabbin cripes fer what
 fenton done fer me he could tell me tgo
 jump off th top uh thet dam there an
 id do it all im sayin im hankerin to
 know whats the idea us bein turned out
 in th dead uh night an findin these
 trucks a-waitin fer us all loaded an
 locked up sos we dont know whuts in
 em

 why ill tell yeh why tom carson
 thars spies in camp thats why

 spies me eye thets a lot uh bunk
 the hell it is didnt one get away this
 mornin thet climbed up th wall uh
 headquarters ter take a shot at general
 fenton

 i still say its bunk if that bunch uh
 dikars couldnt even spot where the guy
 come out o th lake there wasnt never
 no guy in it they even sent divers down
 t see if he was caught in th spillway an
 they couldnt-

 all right men the dark shape that
 was suddenly in the road had walts
 voice youll be moving in a minute
 your instructions remain unchanged
 maintain as much distance behind the
 truck ahead as you can without losing
 sight of it watch for a sudden stop show
 no lights keep your motor running as
 quietly as possible and on no account use

 your horn is that perfectly clear
   yes capn bennet

   i shall be on the leading truck in
case of emergency cut your muffler out
for a count of two and ill stop the mo-
torcade come back to you thats all
walt moved on toward the head of the
line carson exclaimed softly must be
somethin big up ef th generals own pus-
sonal aides ridin with us

   dikars muscles were twitching under
his skin he was really going when
walt had said your instructions remain
unchanged hed told dikar that nor-
manfenton had heard nothing new to
make him change his mind when walt
had said i shall be on the leading
truck hed told dikar that he was going
along as far as the trucks were going

rphe motor of the first truck made
a sound another one throbbed in the
darkness and now the one here in front
of dikar came alive it was moving the
next one came slowly past him and then
the last

   dikar lifted out in the road leaped for
the narrow shelf across its back his foot
missed his fingerhold on a knob at the
corner slipped and then his toes caught
in a loop of chain and he was all right

  the truck was moving very slowly
dikar got up on the little shelf groped
for the padlock that held the doors closed
a tug and it came loose dikar pulled
one door open climbed in through it
pulled it shut making sure it didnt slam
the blackness was thick but his hand
found a loose little board at the doors
edge and he turned it to hold the door
closed

   the hoot-owl signal to walt the pad-
lock that wasnt really locked this little
board were the first three of all the
things normanfenton had given dikar to
remember

   he was squeezed between the door and
what felt like a rough wooden wall rising
just inside the truck swayed a lot that
was because the road twisted like a snake
crawling down the hillside wheels rum-
bled underneath and the chain that had
saved dikar clanked as it hit up against
something

   the clanking stopped all of a sudden
just as there was a soft bump against the
end of the truck dikars scalp prickled
and then he remembered how narrow the
road down the hill was so narrow that
the bushes on either side of it would
scrape the sides of the trucks

   in some places the boughs of trees met
over the road it must be a very leafy
bough hanging low that had bumped the
trucks roof

   now they must be at the bottom of the
hill and the road must be getting straight
because the rumbling told dikar they
were going faster and faster he squeezed
around to face the wooden wall and his
hands crawled up it feeling that it was
made up of big wooden boxes piled high
when he got his arms stretched up over
his head he could just reach the top of
the boxes his hands closed on an edge
and he pulled himself up

the space under the trucks roof was
just big enough for dikar to scrouge into
it he didnt have to inch along very far
before the top of the boxes ended

dikar worked himself around till he lay
sidewise along the inner edge of the boxes
and then let his legs down over the edge
he dropped down into a black space

the space was as wide as the truck
but toward the front another wall of
boxes closed it off just the other side of
this there must be a hole in the front wall
of the truck because dikar could hear
someone say i dont see why theyre
makin us drive in the dark it would be
different if we werent allowed to show
as many lights and fires as we want
around camp

  we aint in camp now you dope the
asafrics aint sendin planes to bomb us
there cause they dont want to wreck the
dam but were gettin far enough away
from it so they dont have to be afraid
of that if they spot us now   

  dikar didnt pay any more attention to
what the men up front were saying he
was down on his knees and his fingers
were prying at the side of the middle
box of the lowest row

  it swung out like a door dikar reached
inside the box found a round thing that
was cold to the feel he touched a little
knob on its side and light leaped out
from it

  the light showed him other things in
the box there was a green uniform
spotted with the dried blood of the dead
asafric it had belonged to there was a
shiny revolver and a shiny leather belt
filled with bullets

  there were two of the fiat glasses that
you could look into and see yourself in
even better than you could see yourself
in a clear smooth pool in the woods
dikar remembered their name mirrors

  dikar grinned thinking how excited
marilee got the first time shed seen one
he mustnt think about marilee not yet
not till it didnt hurt so much to think
about her

  beside the mirrors there were a comb
and a bottle of the black water walt had
used to make dikars hair and beard
black that time last fall when- dikar kid-
naped major benjamin apgar the amer-
ican spy who for years had been on
hashamotos staff

  dikar hung the flashlight on a nail
sticking out from the side of the truck he
fixed the mirrors one on each wall of
boxes so that he could see the face and
back of his head picking up the comb
and the bottle of black water he went to
work on his hair and beard

  all the time he worked the rumble
of wheels went on underneath him car-
rying him on into the night

  when hed finished the job as well as
he could dikar started to put on the
green uniform his legs got all tangled
up in it and he was thrown down as the
truck went around a curve and bumped
his head but he got it fixed right at last

  he was glad theyd found out that a lot
of the abyssinians didnt wear shoes be-
cause the uniform only made him feel
uncomfortable and clumsy but with shoes
on he would have been good for nothing

  dikar fastened the belt around his waist
and put the revolver into the pocket fixed
on the belt to hold it there was another
pocket on the belt for a knife dikar put
his own knife into it

  he bent and put into the box the limp
sheath that marilee had made for his
knife and the apron of plaited twigs that
hed brought from the mountain lifting
dikar saw in the mirror a tall swart
abyssinian in asafric green black-beard-
ed and scowling

  underneath him the wheels rumbled
rolling faster and faster

  dikar put the other things away into
the box the flashlight last the dark that
came when he thumbed the little button
on its side seemed even blacker than be-
fore he closed the side of the box set-
tled down on the floor his back propped
against the box on the other side 

  he was very tired he was so tired that
the rolling rumble of the wheels blurred
was like the rush of a wide dark river  

  a loud snort woke him the truck had
stopped

  whats up the soldier up front was

frightened cripes jordan whats
stopped us

chapter ix

ill hide the river

liyjmhy-whyd you signal cap ben-
 net the scared soldier babbled
i dont see nothin dikar could imag-
ine him staring wide-eyed into the dark
his hands tight on his gun i dont see
nobody

  relax the other man up there said
there aint nothin to see were stopped
because were fresh out of gas thats all
out youre nuts the first one
yelped i checked the gauge when we
started an it said-

  full tank sure it says the same
thing now an we been running damn
near all night that gauge is jammed
cal an the monkey was supposed to fill
us up must of went by it

cal groaned what do we do now
ask the captain here he comes
dikar pushed himself to his feet made
sure the revolver and his knife were safe
in the belt walts voice came in to him
low but plain whats the trouble men
both talked at once telling him

  thats rank carelessness walt sound-
ed awful mad somebody will be sorry
for it when i get back but we cant hold
up the whole convoy ive got to get it to
cairo before daylight

  hey cap hows about we siphon
some gas out of each of the other tanks
mmmmn no it would take too long
besides they all might run out if we do
that i guess well have to leave you-
oh damn you men are supposed to go
on to betteville first thing in the morn-
ing all right he snapped as if hed
just made up his mind heres how well
work it

  you two men go up to the lead truck
and tell sergeant carnorvan i want him
to take the other four trucks on to cairo
and then find places in them for your-
selves ill stay here and guard this one
till you can send some gas back here to
me get going

  yes sir scraping noises from up
front told dikar that jordan and the
other soldier were getting off he reached
up chinned himself to the top of the
boxes the space under the roof was a
tight fit on account of the uniform he
had on now but he managed to crawl
through to the back end and squeeze
down again to the floor

  a throb of motors beat against the
truck faded gravel crunched outside
and knuckles thumped on the truck-door
dikar twisted away the little board that
held the door closed

fresh air was like a drink of cold wa-
ter after the thick stinking stuff hed
been breathing there was still no moon
but walts head and shoulders were plain
against the paler dark

  dikar dropped down alongside of him
and said you did that good the way
you talked those soldiers couldnt ever
guess it was you that fixed things so
theyd have to stop here

  yes walt chuckled the whole thing
worked out swell youve disappeared
from camp and no one can possibly know
which way you went or how

  dikar thought of something hey
wont the men who unload the truck
wonder why the boxes are piled that
way with a big hole in the middle
nobodys going to unload it im go-
ing to set it afire and report that it was
done by an asafric patrol from whom i
escaped by the skin of my teeth

dikar stiffened thats what cal was

scared of the blacks do prowl around

here

  right enough were quite near their
outposts here and every now and then
some of them slip through our lines to do
as much damage as they can under cover
of night

  but the way you look youll have to
worry more about being spotted by oui
friends rather than by the enemy which
is why wed better quit wasting time
gabbing come on ill show you just
where we are so you can make what dis-
tance you can before daylight this way
they went around the ead of the truck
and abruptly dikar stopped pulling back
against walts hand on his arm wait
yes were in a town

  but the noise the trucks made sure
must have waked someone up theyll
see us

  the trucks didnt wake anyone up
dikar walt spoke in a queer flat tone
take another look

  dikars eyes narrowed

  the houses didnt just look black be-
cause they stood against the sky they
were black the black of charred wood
not oneof them had glass in its win-
dows or a whole roof

  over here there were just two walls
standing to make a corner that gap
down there wasnt a big garden but a
tumbled heap of burned timbers the
high thing sticking up out of it was a
chimney standing guard over the ashes
of a home

  no dikar our trucks couldnt make
a loud enough noise to wake the people
who sleep in those houses they are the
most fortunate of those who once lived
here the others- walt shrugged its
the old story its happened thousands of
times in the last twelve years all over
america someones capacity for en-
durance came to an end and he turned
on his tormentor his neighbors paid for
his crime    come on over here i
want to show you something

  dikar stumbling along beside him was
too heartsick with thinking of what had
happened here to watch or care where he
was being led look down there walt
said stopping him and pointing

the houses were just black sticks
leaning every which way so you
could look right through them looking
through them dikar saw water glint-
ing faintly in the dark the water was
so wide dikar could not see the land on
its other side it was a wide dark river

  the mississippi walt said on its
way to the gulf of mexico its flow will
give you your direction

  youve got a boat to take me down it
like the one you had to take me down
the hudson to new york that time i-
no dikar walt broke in that
would be sheer suicide maybe you could
get down almost to memphis without dis-
covery-theres enough of the night left-
but the asafrics hold that city and all
the territory below it

  from there on down the river is
crowded with their vessels gunboats
freighters all kinds of boats moving
troops to and from garrisons batches of
slaves to the various plantations you
couldnt travel a hundred yards without
being seen and you have five hundred
miles to go

 five hundred muscles knotted
uhder the skin of dikars face it would
take me weeks on foot walt his fingers
dug into walts arm im goin down that
river i dont know how but ive got to
go down it to get to yucatan in time and
so ill find a way

seven isnt lucky

its an old chinese custom never wait for a natural to come up because in china its the
sign of mr seven and mr seven is poison-but definitely from the lore of nureddin ali
the college student with the turban

by e hoffmann price

author of hindu holiday yaqui gold etc

 down the tracks that run along the
 embarcadero a switch engine
 hissed and muttered a foghorn
 woooooed and what few lights there were
 didnt count for the mist

   we bump-bumped over the rails that
 make battery street no more than a
 name on the map i said to nureddin ali
 anne is nuts if she thinks her old man
 came down here to sleep off a drunk
 nureddin cocked his turban but i
 

 didnt know whether he was listening or
 just whiffing the air his nose was thin
 and beaked and now the nostrils flared
 and twitched a bit

  something burns not referring to
 your sentiments toward anne jordan

  me anne heck shes just a cus-
tomer

  we were idling along in one of my re-
 conditioned and guaranteed cars when i
 fix them up you cant hear them and you
 cant smell them i said look here just
 because youre trying to squirm out of

 signing on the dotted line you dont need
 to rib this bus

 i was thinking about the drunken
watchman nureddin said annes
father

 then i got it burned paint at the
pacific  asiatic importing companys
warehouse where old man jordan
punched the watchmans clock i mean
where hed used to make the rounds till
he got fired

 now drunk and hostile he was going
back and punch the clock whether or no
thats what anne told me over the phone
breaking in just about the time nureddin
was getting ready to make a down pay-
ment

 she wanted me to find her dad before
he got into a jam and here i was anne
is that kind of a girl or maybe im that
kind of a guy
  swung right and bumped over some
ties about the time we were opposite
the warehouse we noticed a cream-
colored buick coupe parked at the load-
ing dock

 my bus had a spotlight which i
trained down the alley one of the side
doors of the warehouse had a hole in it
a couple feet wide and maybe four feet
high that black blob against the gray
paint was plain

  i began to understand the burned paint
somebody must have used a cutting
torch to slice a panel out of the door
my first thought was anne sure will lift
the roof if her old man is practicing up
burglary

  the thing to do was to tell the cops
but that was just what i wasnt doing
not until i made sure old man jordan
hadnt passed out inside though that
new buick wasnt within a number of
years or pounds of being jordans car

  so we went in and thats how we met
the corpse

the man was folded up on the asphalt
emulsion floor maybe three four
yards inside i couldnt get a good look
at his face there was too much blood on
it someone had popped him a honey
the blunt instrument was a pinch bar
like you use for prying up box lids

  that poor fellow had an assortment of
compound fractures that made me want
to park my lunch

  his soft white hands were curled up
his gray suit was a mess though it was
pressed his shoes were shined and he
wore a high grade wristwatch the hat
lying near a stack of rattan rice pockets
must have cost fifteen bucks anyway

  nureddin said manifestly this is not
the night watchman

  then he dipped into the coat pocket
there were two letters addressed to the
pacific  asiatic import company one
was marked for the attention of mr w f
westfield

  then there was a wallet with a drivers
license that settled another detail the
dead man was hewitt barclay aged 
weight  and he lived out in st fran-
cis wood

  nureddin slipped the stuff back into
the pocket and snapped on the lights the
warehouse reached from battery street
to sansome all brick with no ventilation
to speak of there was a smell of fish
ginger tung oil and dried shrimp

  in one corner were cases of ng ka pay
which is chinese rice brandy that tastes
like orange shellac blended with rubber
between sumatra tobacco persian dates
bars of banka tin and chinese groceries
pacific  asiatic covered the field

  nureddin was interested in the cut in
the iron door it was a ragged job and in
spots the metal had foamed and boiled

  for maybe a sixteenth of an inch the
paint was completely gone then a quar-
ter of an inch of paint with all the life
baked out of it powdery white-and-yel-
low thats a smell that lasts long and
carries far

  just outside the hole and a bit to one
side was the piece that had been taken
out

  up front on a sort of mezzanine floor
was a glassed-in office steps led to it
from the front entrance i headed for the
phone and when i got to the foot of the
stairs i saw that the front door was un-
locked a key was still in place and a
ring with other keys dangled from it

 when i reached the mezzanine i
planted myself at a golden oak desk
marked mr barclay and dialed the cops
there was a private office marked mr
westfield a third desk was marked
chief clerk

  the man at police headquarters wasnt
impressed by another corpse along the
embarcadero not even when i told him
whose it was but id barely gotten down
from the mezzanine when i heard a siren
howling its head off

  nureddin said if you drive me back
to berkeley ill tell you something in-
teresting

he was studying engineering and he
lived at international house along
with a bunch of other arabs a few
turks and some chinese the foreign
contingent coming to uc for super-
education

  so i said sure but what is so damn
-hey who pays the bridge tolls and
are you buying this reconditioned and
guaranteed

  nureddin yawned haste is of satan
easy to buy hard to sell

  are you telling me here i try to sell
old man jordan a new used bus and he
gets fired im trying to sell anne one
and she says all her boy friends have
cars

  they do do they not

  sure and she has lots of them boy
friends

  so you neglect me a customer and go
out to find her poor drunken father and
you find a corpse now this interesting
thing i promised to tell you

  i guess youll say this is a warehouse
robbery

  nureddin nodded and patted his white
turban into shape though it always did
look like it was die-cast he wore an
emerald ring with a stone in it the size
of a muscat grape so big that youd take
it for a phoney shah jahan emperor of
india gave it to one of the nureddin
family about three hundred years ago
and it hasnt been in the hands of a
pawnbroker since then

  warehouse robbery yes the odd
feature is the thief took ten cases of
green apricots in spiced syrup worth
about six dollars a case retail

  before i could ask him how he figured
everything out including the flavor of
the syrup the cops piled in an ambu-
lance pulled up

  two press men got busy with flash
bulbs and the police camera man got
busy the photographers got pictures of
everything but each other in the mean-
while nureddin and i were answering
questions

  the cops dont like fellows with tur-
bans first because hats are the fashion
and second because there have been
thirty-four hindu murders-in california
all but one of them unsolved nureddin
ali having uncorked that one last sum-
mer

  however these brave lads in blue
didnt know him one said to his buddy
another one of these damn hindus
he turned to nureddin and said all
right you savvy english whatcher
name

  i am sayyied nureddin ali al mam-
oun ibn ghazi is spelling included in the
police manual

  that got a hand from everyone but the
gent with the notebook and he said
never mind the wisecracks

  they finally got him catalogued as n
ali student uc

 my name was easy enough dean
webber huh dean of what
reconditioned and guaranteed cars
huh

  im no professor much less a dean of
anything it started this way anne
jordan-thats the watchmans daughter
-asked me to find her dad

  where is he

  havent found him yet all i found

was this dead guy i didnt look down

  there was no chance of stalling every
time i tried it they headed me off youd
have thought they thought id conked
barclay

  then nureddin cut in pardon me
officer my friend is confused miss jor-
dans father was-ah-quite swacked de-
spondent you might say at having been
dismissed

  fired is the word i think a week
ago and he insisted on coming to the
warehouse

  i shouted him down hes whacky
sergeant he doesnt know a thing about
it

  nureddin raised the hand with the
emerald as i was saying sergeant i
was in mr webbers office when she
phoned and that was my understanding

  miss jordan seemed to fear that her
poor drunken father might insist on
walking his beat anyway and hed get
into trouble that was my understand-
ing mr webber very kindly agreed to
find him i came along

  the sergeant turned on me what the
hells the idea of holding out

  between you and him i havent had
a chance to answer anything am i a
mind reader do i know what the gal
had on her mind weeping into the
phone why wouldnt i do her a favor
i been trying to sell her a car the last
three months

before we got through nureddins
story was a matter of record when
i finally stepped out into the nice cool
fog i remembered id forgotten some-
thing that quip hed made about green
apricots in syrup

  i said i have half a notion to tell
them what you held out what was the
idea of spilling the beans about the old
man being drunk and hostile and cussing
the boss

  nureddin twisted the dash lighter and
touched off a cigarette before he an-
swered it is this way dean they will
hunt the old man and that will save you
many gallons of fuel

  many my eye this bus gives  per
gallon in traffic

  i dont think he believed me he just
said another thing theyll suspect him
the girl will be worried silly as the
saying goes

  i wanted to sock him but sometimes he
was a nice fellow and he might be a
customer some day thats just it you
heel shes a swell gal shes a honey
and her old man is a good guy and he
used to have a big job before he went
busted

  nureddin had an answer they will
suspect mr jordan but they cant prove
a thing mainly because he is innocent
even the police will finally admit that
that poor kid is half screwy from
worry

  when you have cleared her father
he calmly went on she will be so grate-
ful that she will buy a reconditioned and
guaranteed car

  i	stared

  me clear him

  well perhaps not you this whole
business is fascinating a man getting an
oxy-acetylene torch to cut a hole into a
warehouse to steal ten cases of green
apricots in spiced syrup have you ever
eaten them

  sounds like cholera morbus to me
anything to humor a customer though
nureddin was the slipperiest id found
in many a year so i swung up pacific
street and through the refined barbary
so-called coast

  for a wonder we found a parking spot
on the main stem of chinatown to buy


green apricots while anne was depend-
ing on me to locate her drunken dad

ii

phinatown has more neon lights
 than any section of frisco except
maybe mission street we hoofed it down
the narrow main stem nureddin looking
into the windows where they had bottles
of ng ka pay and dried horn toads and
gentian root finally he saw a place that
looked right

  a minute later he came out with a
can of green apricots in spiced syrup and
he said now let us see anne jordan
anne and her dad lived out on san
jose avenue i headed up the california
street hill in high which is swell even
for a new car it didnt take us long be-
fore we were rolling along through a
section of little houses with their fronts
jammed right on the sidewalk and their
sides wedged against each other

  id barely pulled up when anne busted
out of the house she was streamlined
and blonde and the light in the doorway
put a glitter in her hair she ran to meet
me to give me a hand with her dad

  her face changed when she saw me
clumping up the stairs with a guy in a
turban following me anne looked puz-
zled and hurt and she said where-
we couldnt find him i stepped to
one side to make way for nureddin
we been looking for him at the ware-
house

  nureddin sized her up for a second
the wide blue eyes the nice curves under
the blue robe the slim ankles he said
after what happened miss jordan it is
just as well that he was not at the ware-
house

  this is nureddin ali i told her
maybe he wont gripe you

  she spent a couple seconds looking at
the lean arab from india tell me about
it im worried mr ali

  we followed her into the little white
shack and parked ourselves in the living
room which was too small for the old
and solid furniture shed salvaged

  there was a persian carpet worn thin
like some they have in museums too
big for the room but class all over

  first time id ever been in her house
and i began to understand how come her
dad would get swacked just thinking too
much hed had big jobs at one time and
getting fired from a warehouse would get
under his skin

  nureddin set the can of apricots on a
tabouret of carved teak we know you
are worried he said perhaps i can
help you why was your father dis-
missed

  she twisted a handkerchief they said
that they didnt need a watchman that
he was a useless expense that the war
had upset the importing business that
there wasnt anything in the warehouse
that needed watching anyway nothing
but chinese groceries and all sorts of
odds and ends like that but where is
he

  we were there and we didnt find
him i got a chance to say that much
for all we know he wasnt there at
all

  anne was getting impatient youre
not telling me everything

  nureddin hefted the can of apricots
these are packed in canton by yee
jun and company

  anne was ready to scream but some-
thing about his purring kept her from
cracking off i said the warehouse was
busted into and robbed tonight anne
they stole ten cases of these things

  anne brightened up a little and re-
laxed oh then maybe dad will get his



job back being fired made him feel use-
less we dont need his salary i earn
enough at verniers but thats not the
point

  nureddin looked at the clock saw it
was eleven and spun the radio dial a
man was killed mr barclayione of the
partners that is why we came out

tight on the second the news com-
mentator chimed in telling about the
war anne cracked off oh how ter-
rible then her face got tense

  mr barclay-killed-mr barclay-
fired dad- she grabbed my arm how
-what did happen have they got
him

  he wasnt there we found barclay
but theyre looking for your father
she looked at the radio is that why
you turned it on

  nureddin nodded the police jumped
at conclusions they would want to find
him we had to explain our presence
you understand in the meanwhile we
wondered about the strange loot green
apricots in-

  he picked up the can and looked at the
lithographed label with green fruit and
chinese chicken tracks in red in
spiced syrup are you sure your father
was dismissed just to save expenses
he smiled that slow smile that never
told you anything loot and not worth
the trouble maybe he knew something
that mr barclay did not want known
may i have a can opener

  she got up he had a way of making
people fall in line with his ideas at the
door leading into the next room she
stopped and asked you mean there
might be smuggling opium for in-
stance and they fired him because he
had a suspicion

  nureddin patted his turban right
now i couldnt make a better guess nor
a worse one

  the news broadcast told all about the
bombs in london annes heels tick-
tacked through the dining room toward
the kitchen nureddin eyed the old per-
sian carpet so old it didnt have a bit of
nap left and it was patched in spots

  a real feraghan he said and the
way he said the words told me it was like
a rolls royce do you know that young
lady has made a very decent guess half
right half wrong

  how do you know they stole apri-
cots

  that asphalt emulsion floor is soft
while you were in the office calling the
police i looked at the marks the weight
of a stack of boxes had made indenta-
tions in the soft paving i could read
the prints the traces of the lettering
painted on the boxes

  they had been removed recently
after standing there quite a while the
dust on the rest of the floor made the
clean squares stand out

  nureddin never skipped anything but
i found one hole in that hell suppose
theyd sold the stuff that afternoon
would the warehouseman make a
trail in the dust leading from the pile to
the hole in the door it was an old door
one they had not used for a long time
the loading dock where trucks pull up
is on the filbert street side not on the
alley side

  he was so slick it griped me all
right you read prints of box markings
transferred to asphalt thatd gotten soft
under a low roof on a hot day and so
you made apricots out of it howd you
know there were ten cases

  that pillar he explained there was
a dust mark between each two boxes
you see they had been stacked there for
some time

anne came in with a can opener

    nureddin set to work the syrup was
spicy smelling the apricots were grass
green he speared one with the point of
the can opener offered it to anne she
shook her head for the radio had a hold
on her i took a bite

    it was hard as a gourd and crisp it
had the pit in it but it wasnt bad eating
once you got used to it i wouldnt kill
a man for ten cases of these

    no one else would

then the police report came in from
the news broadcast anne said oh
lord and jerked back they had found
her old man in his parked car at the
foot of clay street near drumm

he couldnt account for anything and
said that for the past two-three hours
he had sat there no one knew what hed
done since leaving the scandanavia sa-
loon where hed finished getting liquored
up

two-three hours alone that was jor-
dans story

anne was white as paper im getting
a lawyer im going down to see him
drive me down ill be dressed in a 
minute

nureddin said they will try to make
him tell where he got a cylinder of
acetylene a cylinder of oxygen a cutting
torch and where he put them and
where he hid ten cases of apricots after
he killed mr barclay they will keep
asking him just tell your father to
speak only the truth miss jordan

hey howd the cops know about the
cots you didnt tell i didnt

but the chief clerk and the inevitable
inventory would tell or the surviving
partner nureddin said without even a
split-second pause so miss jordan just
tell your father not to speak other than
the truth

what else would he speak she flared
up

he raised the hand with the emperors
emerald it is very hard for a man to
keep to a truth that no one will believe
he is the handiest suspect he has a mo-
tive he was drunk and angry so they
will force the facts to fit the easiest way
being human

a nne eased up im glad you said
that i might have believed-be-
lieved that dad did do something wild

is it hard to get acetylene and the rest
nureddin was an engineer and i had
used the stuff for cutting up old cars for
jur k we both knew the answers but
for once i beat him to it

theyre easy to get anne anyone can
buy them stealthem from a construc-
tion job but they weigh about a hun-
dred pounds apiece and then there are
the gadgets and the torch and the hose
that goes with the outfit hauling them
around is a chore hiding them is an-
other

why- she stopped at the bedroom
door why its silly thinking that a
groggy man could do a job like that the
fools

when she closed the door nureddin
said to me maybe i can furnish another
suspect before they beat a confession
out of mr jordan

huh that crusty old buzzard-theyll
have to work a week to wear him down
that is good nureddin drew his
finger tips across his palm before the
police have finished proving mr jordan
did the work i will have a chance to
speak to-well the dead mans partner
his chief clerk perhaps to some of my
chinese friends

i still do not think that this old man
cut a warehouse open and killed one of
his employers just to prove that a watch-
mans services are indispensible
neither do i but thats still more mo-
tive proving it was crazy to fire him
maybe barclay dropped in remember
that key hanging in the door and sur-
prised him and jordan conked him and
then cooled off

  and then got stinking drunk the way
i might do after killing a man when id
just intended to sock him one for general
indignation

  you couldnt blame the cops for trying
to make that shoe fit the uselessness of
the loot-the point id figured would
prove old man jordan couldnt have done
the job-was what really made it all the
worse

 nureddin said tomorrow we go to
chinatown to ask about green apricots
and about the partners

  huh youll get plenty out of china-
men

  he struck light to a cigarette and his
brows twitched like devilish little wings
making chinese talk is impossible but
persuasion-

  then anne came out all dressed with
a handbag tucked under her arm she
smiled and caught my arm and nured-
dins i heard every word of it and
somehow you make it sound worse and
sound better

ill

re morning paper got it all nicely
boiled down with old man jordan
unanimously elected when i drove anne
down to the big smoke-staineid hall of
justice on kearney street the night of
the murder i had intended to wait out-
side while she talked to her dad but
nureddin horned in for all that i gave
him a dirty look and nudged him

  let the gal talk to her dad without an
audience but nureddin made a smooth
job of it and she insisted on him tagging
along through the creosote smell of that
old jug well whatd i do but tag along
too

  jordan was still groggy but he knew
what the score was he was big and
square-rigged with shaggy gray brows
and wiry gray hair and his close-cropped
mustache was bristly

 the turnkey let anne into the cell
nureddin and i stayed in the corridor

  the old man said ive beena plain
fool but dont you worry

  anne was crying a little she sat be-
side him on that iron-latticed bunk with
the crummy blankets spread over it and
put one arm over his square shoulders
dad i know you didnt do it ive got a
lawyer on the way cant you remember
what you did where you went

  he snorted and straightened up who
are those fellows

 mr webber and mr ali they drove
me down theyll help me

  private detective the other one i
mean

 no nureddin cut in im an en-
gineer he took my flashlight out of
his pccket mr jordan will you please
stretch your legs out so i can look at
your shoes

 jordan gav him a funny look then
chuckled go ahead you wont find
any filbert street dirt on them i wasnt
there i got swacked and forgot it till
they found me parked and snoring

 the flash played around jordans
square-toed shoes they were black half-
soled and had a good shine

  then the light shifted to the blue wor-
sted pants threadbare but pressed a
nail snag stitched so you could hardly
see it the pants hadnt dragged dirt from
his heels nureddin squinted and said

no cuffs he straightened up then

 jordan frowned and shiny at the
knees young man

  nureddin looked him in the eye smiled
snapped off the light im quite con-
vinced you did not kill mr barclay he
bowed from the hips and touched his
forehead with his fingertips somehow
that did not look stagey

  good luck sir we will wait outside

  which we did and looking back at all
that the following morning while i
tossed off some javi along with the
paper i wondered what nureddin had
seen about jordans pants and shoes
that the cops had skipped

 i phoned anne when she said that
the lawyer was sure the grand jury
wouldnt bring an indictment she
sounded like shed been awake all night

 dont strike me youre much im-
pressed with the mouthpieces optimism
honey dont let it get you down he
wouldnt get a preliminary hearing till
this afternoon and he may not even be
bound over to the grand jury

  i got that sigh over the wire oh hes
all right only its not his father its
just a client thanks for calling but i
do have to hurry to work

 work

 win lose or draw this will take
money her laugh was a brave stab at
being cheerful how much do you bid
for dads car well i dont think theyll
let me out for being a notorious mans
daughter

 she hung up lucky anne wasnt
working in a place where she had to
meet the public or theyd have had to
sack her like that dame in the beauty
parlor the customers came to gawk and
not te get finger waves

 but anne was private secretary to a
box manufacturer so having her picture
on the front page didnt hurt her not
much

 i looked at the paper she was a
camera mans treat if shed knocked
barclay off herself shed be signing on
the line for a floorshow or something

that day i muffed a couple of push-
over sales i told a joy rider to go
climb a tree and an hour later he drove
past bearing down on the horn of a bus
hed bought next door he wasnt a joy-
rider after all

  either i was losing my grip or i was
worried about anne

  finally i turned the place over to my
left-hand man-me being the right hand
and that all thumbs-and called nured-
din at international house

  hed left a call for me not wanting to
break in on business he wanted me to
meet him in chinatown at pagoda place
to watch a chinese funeral of all things

 i parked near the three dragons on
jackson street the air was thick with
the smoke of black powder someone was
sawing on a sam-yin a sort of fiddle that
sounds like a tortured cat

  gongs were whanging away like crazy
and a little old chinaman was pasting
strips of bright red flimsy on the dirty
brick wall at the corner of jackson and
the alley

 then i jumped and ducked for cover
but it was just the start of a firecracker
barrage a couple chinese dames gave
me a merry laugh the whole alley
began crackling like a bunch of machine
guns had gone crazy nothing but part
of the fixing for an old style funeral

 and everyone going to the prelimi-
naries gets slices of bacon boiled in sugar
syrup and candied water lily roots and
maybe a silk handkerchief

  nureddins white turban stood out like
a torch light parade in that murky alley

i dodged a street car danced over the
slippery cobblestones and asked him
whos dead and what is it to us

  he handed me an early edition and
pointed kwong li committed suicide
he is now enjoying-nureddins deep set
eyes had a laugh in them-a lavish
funeral i am full of almond wafers and
candied kumquats and tea and-
thats not all youre full of eating
candy while theyre hanging old man
jordan you act like youre tickled about
kwong lis doing the dutch act what
have you got against him

lots of people had plenty against
kwong li next to dog stories and
kid stories for human interest the papers
love chinee stuff and kwong li had
spent forty years being advertised as the
slickest crookedest smilingest slant-eye
in all the thirty thousand mongolians of
chinatown

  g-men had broken their hearts trying
to prove - he smuggled hop girls and
aliens you might not know who  the
mayor of frisco was but youd be sure
who kwong li was

  remember the time he was getting
shaved two highbinders came in with
hatchets before they got one cut at him
he pulled a short-barreled  from under
his bib and blew them both back on their
rumps and then made the barber carry
on

  he always padded around in his shoes
with the inch-thick felt soles his skinny
old hands hidden in his sleeves he said
he was a klistian chinaman

  the foxy old buzzard used to give
candy to the white kids that came with
their folks to see chinatown he paid off
debts for busted gamblers he was easy
copy for feature writers and they loved
him no wonder there was a big blurb
about the eccentric and lovable son of
confucius who suicided early this after-
noon

  but i still didnt see what they had to
do with annes dad

  nureddin said the surviving partner
of pacific  asiatics will be here before
the obsequies are over he has to be
the company had chinese customers
look hes pulling up now

  a car door slammed a tall man in a
dark topcoat was heading for the alley
he had a big beak of a nose a tanned
face and slightly popping eyes they
looked awfully tired and worried his
mouth was unsteady and a bit loose his
chin didnt match that he-man face

  nureddin said there was no partner-
ship insurance i cut school today and
found that out among other things
westfield edged in through the crowd
of chinese and we followed him up the
stairs where the corpse waited as we
reached the second floor i saw that the
loft was jammed with lean chinks with
chubby chinks with chinks in silk
jackets and caps and with young squirts
in store clothes

  boys circulated around offering cakes
and drinks candles three inches thick
and a couple feet high stood in rows at
the far end

  the coffin was on a trestle and the
smoke of joss-sticks made the air blue

  even if you could understand chinese
that screeching sam yin that plink-
plonk-plank of a flat-backed mandolin
the tomtoms and the gongs would have
knocked every word out of shape

  the men who filed past the coffin all
stopped at the head and bowed to the
young man who stood there clasping his
own two hands and returning the bows

that coffin was built like a battleship
the planks had to be heavy or they


couldnt have been carved so deep you
couldnt tell what kind of wood it was
for every inch of it was painted red and
decorated in gilt

  i tiptoed and looked over those hats
and little silk caps they kept them on
as a mark of respect id forgotten my-
self so i put mine back on

  the coffin planks were three inches
thick anyway i couldnt see the corpse
except just a bit of yellow face a million
wrinkles a shriveled mouth and that
mouth gave me the creeps

i yelled in nureddins ear that old
buzzard is laughing at something hes
layed a dirty joke on someone i bet
e committed suicide to spite someone
to bring em tough luck

  so you believe that too he did not
yell but his voice ate right through all
the noise

  he was ribbing me for a boob hell
i read they do that dive off to put a curse
on an enemy

  he caught my elbow and i looked
westfield hat on where it belonged
formed an alley in the crowd they
melted away he didnt touch a man not
even with his sleeve

  i said im getting a close look
kwong li is snickering no one ever beat
him alive no one beats him when hes
dead

  dont nureddin said you cant
get near

  but i tried

  i still dont know how they did it no-
body shoved me around nobody prodded
me but a solid mass of chinamen
blocked me

  i said there were dozens of them there
must have been a hundred popping up
from nowhere with little glasses of
wine cups of tea cookies they didnt
seem to see me or know i was there but
i did not want to shake a tea cup out of
anyones hand and rile them

  before i knew what was going on i
was back a dozen feet where i belonged
i guess

  nureddin had a silent laugh

  westfield was bowing chinese fashion
the young man by the coffin was bowing
the yellow wave shifted and the two
were edged toward a door i hadnt no-
ticed

  i caught one look of westfields face
he was gulping like a fish out of water

  i followed nureddin to the entrance
an old man gave me a white silk hand-
kerchief and i said thank you he didnt
give nureddin one you dont get seconds

  when we got down to the street the
arab said shake the fire-cracker paper
from your shoes and take me for a
drive

  hey i was going to see anne

  later yes but now take me to west-
fields house like his late partner he
lives in st francis wood

  what in hell has this funeral got to
do with old man jordan

  i think that the answer to barclays
death lies somewhere between kwong li
and mr westfield let me drive while
you read westfields statement in the
paper

  just read and ignore police guesses
as to whether acetylene and oxygen
stolen from the construction job on third
street was used to cut open pacific 
asiatic warehouse

  answer there is probably yes but
definitely irrelevant

iv

while nureddin booted that recon-
ditioned and guaranteed over twin
peaks i managed to read but sometimes
i skipped a line mainly from wondering



whether to jump or stick with the roller
coaster

  but i did get westfields statement be-
fore we zoomed down the far side and
into the madhouse of horseshoe streets
in st francis wood

  barclay he said had hollered on ac-
count of the asiatic unpleasantness play-
ing hell with the import and export busi-
ness and claimed they ought to cut down
expenses by firiftg the watchman and the
chief clerk

  after all westfield claimed you didnt
need a watchman to guard groceries and
such like it wasnt like a bank or jewel-
ery store the warehouse was fireproof
and it had looked theft-proof too

  taking a bunch of apricots cockeyed
no chinese angle at all just a sour puss
old man trying to prove his job shouldnt
have been eliminated

  while nureddin was nosing into one of
the gateways that give the exclusive
touch to the section just off portola
boulevard i said to him hell this is
all static we know all this

  he set the parking brake correction
please this afternoon i talked to the
widow mrs barclay and she insists her
late husband was against firing the
watchman that he was annoyed at his
partners insistence

  that makes westfield a liar

  very concise unless newspaper men
made a mistake and misquoted him the
widow also said that business was not
bad but that westfield had overdrawn
his account he played the races

  if it hadnt been for the hole in the
door and the missing apricots id have
said westfield got called for pulling too
much dough from the till and he conked
his partner

  but it was a cinch that hed not have
had time to dash out for a couple hun-
dred pounds of gas tanks and cutting
equipment to fake a robbery ajter hed
killed barclay in a sudden wrangle

that pinch bar did make it look like
a sudden brawl not a planned job
yet the cutting torch angle wasnt spur
of the moment i still had chinese
funerals on the brain when i asked
quizzing westfields wife

  no nureddin headed up the grade
mrs westfield is indefinitely away from
home i hope i was not misinformed or
she will be startled

  she will we will pal i do not like
this a bit

  nureddin jingled a bunch of keys he
stalked along easy as if he owned the
whole district lights winked among the
trees and chauffeurs tooled big cads
and packards around the curves

  he said a man living here would lose
face if he had to move to quarters like
anne jordans he would go far to keep
from leaving

  now be casual we go in by the front
door that makes it an honest mistake
the house had white pillars and sat
well back on a terrace there were oaks
and conifers and some acacias a broad
drive made a loop in front of the house
a branch led to the garage

  nureddin stepped to the door and tried
a key he did not waste any time with
that one nor with the second the third
one kept him entertained i could hear
the metal whispering and grating as he
fooled around

  then the bolt slid and he walked in
he found a switch and snapped it i
was sweating and uncomfortable but its
hard to run out when the other fellow
is so cool

  stairs led to the second floor to the
left of the vestibule was a long living
room with hardwood floor that had a thin

coat of dust over its polish there was
a grand piano and some scatter rugs be-
yond that a breakfast room and sun
parlor

  we backtracked and headed up the
carpeted stairs nureddin skipped the
first- two bedrooms whose furnishings
were covered and stepped into the third

  he glanced at the walnut dresser and
then opened a clothes closet he looked
at all the shoes most of them were on
trees then he looked at the suits and i
wondered what for it was something
like his way of going over old man jor-
dans shoes and pants

  he didnt say anything and his poker
face told me nothing

  maybe he was looking for bits of
scattered brain and drops of blood it
takes a good cleaning to get every trace
but i was too jittery to askor argue
they usually have private watchmen in
these deluxe comers of town even early
in the evening

  nureddin pointed toward a room with
an acre of windows facing to the back
and over the rooftops of houses further
down grade it was a library furnished
with a walnut desk and a lounge

  on the desk was a red piece of paper
with one chinese character done in
black a thumbtack held it down near
it was a white rooster with a sliced
throat fresh blood spattered the desk
top and the floor and the chair

  fu manchu coming to town huh
that fell flat as beer on a plate what
kind of a game is this

i knew damn well it was no game
leaving this dump looked better
every minute a chinese delegation had
beaten us to it by not much time

  i began to think of that yellow wave
that edged westfield to the back room
at the funeral all of a sudden i knew
that wed watched a pattern shaping up
and not just accidental trifles

  killing a white rooster nureddin
said is one of the first steps to putting
a curse on a man they do it in burma
in the malay states in the chinese se-
cret societies someone is not playing
can you read that brush-splashing
that happens to be one of the few
characters i do know it is a number
westfields i guess chinese humor
that is seven it means completion
the end the fullness which is what
death is for every man it also means
traitor ah-tsat mr seven is the name
they give what you call a double-crosser

  this may be only a warning or it may
be a sentence i wonder what westfield
will say when he sees what has been
put on his desk while he attended a
funeral

  im not waiting to listen then i
heard footsteps below a mutter of people
trying to talk in an undertone and
making a hash of it whatll we do
duck or hide in a closet or-

  shhh he listened a second and
shook my hand off his arm there were
sounds from the back a scratching at a
screen they always surround a place

 he snapped off the switch in the study
as he strolled down the hall toward the
stairs he sounded off no i do not care
for this place quite too big that fool
of an agent

  maybe that gag would work-pretend-
ing we were looking over a house ad-
vertised for rent so i adlibbed what in
hells wrong with it aint it furnished
there werent any more sounds below
and my guess was neither were there
any ways of dodging a squad of cops a
licensed private detective might get away
with this but not us two eggs

  then i felt someone looking holes into
my back i turned nothing but an open
bathroom door but in the medicine
cabinet mirror i saw the reflection of
the chinaman peeping past the edge of a
shower curtain the glass picked him
out behind the gathered folds that had
been slid to one end of the stall other-
wise id never have seen him

  in the meanwhile nureddin wrangled
his way to the foot of the stairs

  there was a cop below a private patrol
cop he wore khaki and a gun the last
being in his hand a crusty bird and his
face looked like he knew he packed a lot
of weight

  all right i guess youre a meter
reader eh howd you get in
nureddin looked at him a second or so
with a key what is the trouble offi-
cer

  the cop didnt know what to think
who would have with that calm fellow
wearing a turban and an easy smile

  trouble for you wise guy walking
into a private residence

  a furnished house nureddin said
as if correcting a half witted boy did
you rent your house without looking at
it

  huh

  wait let me show you he dug a
newspaper clipping out of his pocket
and also a key which had a real estate
agents tag on it you might try calling
crawford  canning and ask them if
nureddin ali did or did not leave a de-
posit for keys to inspect a house

  the tag had westfields address and the
street number

rphe cop didnt know whether hed
a made a mistake or not he said
hell this is westfields house he didnt
tell me he was sub-leasing i saw him
last night

  the agent did not say whose house it
was i was not interested

nureddin twirled the key the cop
stepped to the phone called crawford 
canning he ended by getting one of the
firm at a residence number he asked
you give a key to a turk or hindu
whatever the answer was he grunted
slammed the receiver all right all
right its my job mr ali just my job
nureddin was nice about it if i
should move in here ill remember your
vigilance who is at the rear
neighbors chauffeur he saw you
and called me

  when we got shed of him and locked
the door behind us-though not with
the key wed offered the cop-i said
one more like that and im through
suppose hed tried the key

  but he didnt because i put him in the
wrong and from the start there really
is a place for rent in this block nobody
but a resident ever does get the num-
bers  straight out here so i got a key
fpr that place

  well it had worked i changed the
subject there was a chinaman hiding
in the first bathroom

  i saw him a clever fellow he got in
without being noticed

  there was a hidden laugh in his voice
and he went on no they didnt see him
they merely saw us

  look here you sound as if thats
swell

  when we reached the car he answered
it is just as you say the policeman
will start thinking and he will ask west-
field or the chauffeur will start talking
in the meanwhile westfield will have
found the sign of mr seven

  i think that he will tell the police
that he expected people to inspect the
house also he may be looking for us
i hope nobody else does

  he will i caught his eye up there at
the funeral a turban is conspicuous you
know

  so youre gunning for westfield you
mean he did knock off barclay

 as i made a u-tum he answered
westfield and the late kwong li were
engaged in smuggling using the pacific

	asiatic import company as a front a
can of apricots need not assay one hun-
dred percent fruit

  it began to make sense but nureddins
trick of pulling things out of air griped
me all over i guess kwong lis family
just up and told you the old man was
smuggling hop or something

  nureddin said i am a moslem from
hindustan however there are twenty
million chinese moslems and islam is
one of the greatest fraternities in the
world

  you understand i could hardly go to
the police to accuse westfield of
smuggling it would cause casualties
among the chinese moslem friends who
trusted my discretion

 we do not want any more mr
sevens

v

assuming nureddin was right about
the smuggling this business made
sense fill those apricot cans with opium
and youd have something and the
sign of mr seven ah-tsat traitor
whered a double-cross come in except
if one partner grabbed all the loot in-
stead of divvying up

  we had nothing to do but catch west-
field with the ten cases of apricots to
prove he had killed hewitt barclay or
that he knew who had

  i said something like that

  nureddin wouldnt say yes or no but
he admitted if westfield has loot he
should have shared with kwong li he
would hardly dare keep it in his house
we cannot wait for him to go to get the
plunder if he is wise he will let it lie
for a long while

  indeed with a murder to complicate
things an unpremeditated murder he
might never go after the apricot cans

  i see you got my point

  he missed that sarcasm so i must
make him get the plunder at once i
think kwong li has similar aims
huh hes dead

  that funny smile again i wanted to
sock him i meant the heirs and as-
signees of the late kwong li absurd of
me after having seen the coffin

  that suicide dont make sense
turn here he cut in we want to
see mrs hewitt barclay i would like to
persuade her to let me manage her in-
terest in the pacific  asiatic import
company

  this was a hot one get me a job
too now kwong li was double-crossed
so he kills himself

  in chinese that makes sense the old
man knew that such an act would make
it a point of honor for all his tong broth-
ers and relatives to hound ah-tsat the
traitor to death or to restitution

  the chinese are funny that way i re-
member hearing of condemned bandits
paying a man to take their place under
the head-lifting sword the substitutes
family got the dough and became inde-
pendent for life the old clan spirit

another winding block and we
parked in front of the late hewitt
barclays house a brick job with a steep
english style roof

  mrs barclay had pulled herself to-
gether she was a swell-looking widow
not a day over thirty-five and she had

a very elegant way of wearing black

  her hair was dark and her skin was
white and clear hardly a touch of make-
up and not a speck of jewelry on those
long slim hands except a platinum
wedding ring

  that gilt-edged louie something fur-
niture managed not to fold up when i sat
down

  she shushed nureddin when he apolo-
gized for intruding again

  im only too glad to help you mr ali
and i do hope you can find something in 
favor of that poor old watchman i cant
believe he killed hewitt

  i had something else in mind could
you if you so desired buy mr west-
fields interest in the company i mean
would it be plausible would it seem
bona fide if you offered to buy

  why-really now im sure i dont
understand why should i buy

  because the partnership is dissolved
he would buy you out

  which would be better

  she was still amazed at nureddin
taking a hand in her affairs but that
didnt bother him pardon me mrs
barclay that would be worse however
you feel about getting away from such
tragic associations you must offer to buy
westfields interest

  whether you actually do so or not is
entirely your own affair madam do not
think i am impertinent but you must
make the offer

  why must i

  her chin went up a little but she was
more puzzled than annoyed nureddin
could sell almost anything in the way of
ideas

  in the interests of justice without
being vindictive you surely wish to ex-
pose the man who struck your husband
down not giving him a chance

  mrs barclays eyes widened and she
leaned forward and one hand closed
tight on the gilded arm of the down-
cushioned love seat how would such a
purchase have that effect

  i do not know not yet but if the
pacific  asiatic import company goes
under an entirely new management it
would be better perhaps you were
thinking of retaining your interest as a
silent partner under a new agreement of
partnership

  well  she eyed me then said
that had occurred to me but-i wasnt
too sure of mr westfield he has had
family troubles and he plays the races
of course you would not be too cer-
tain that your interest would be pro-
tected so why not make him a fair
offer you could readily engage a man-
ager to attend to the import business

  you could sell out yes but a gambler
is usually in need of money and so you
would get the advantage if you bought
hed sell for a low figure

  i think i see your point she said
slowly

vureddin poured on the oil i
 rather suspected from the chief
clerks remarks that your husband was
the real head of the partnership and that
mr westfields only asset beside his
original investment was his chinese con-
nections and with the suicide of kwong
li-

oh she sat up straight when
this afternoon i know youve had no
time for the papers as i said with
kwong lis suicide i doubt that mr
westfields connections amount to much
you dont like mr westfield

  i do not have more confidence in him
than you do until he is entirely out of
the company my hands are tied justice
is tied and doubly blind


  the police have a suspect and so far
i am unable to prove that they are
wrong help me and i shall clear him-
and expose the criminal

  westfield she fairly whispered
that	j

  nureddins gesture committed him to
nothing at all westfield has some odd
associates please call him now i am
sure he will hurry over

  she went into the hall where there
was a phone alcove i listened to the dial
ticking

  i said to nureddin look here if he
did kwong li dirt those chinese will kill
him and its pretty hard to hang any-
thing on a dead man even if you are
holding out circumstantial evidence it
wont do a bit of good unless the cops can
use it to slug a confession out of him and
how do you slug a corpse

  the chinese will not harm him
neither can you make a corpse tell where
ten cases of apricots are hiddeir

  i could hardly make out what mrs
barclay was saying over the wire

xlhen she came back she began he
is quite interested he will be over
as soon as he can get in touch with his
lawyer he wants to draw up the pa-
pers

  without an inventory or checking of
the books

  the final price will depend on all that
and he said that hed take a down pay-
ment the balance to be subject to the
auditors report

  nureddin leaned back eyes nearly
shut he was twisting that big emerald
set in old soft gold ive seen him on
short rations but ive never seen him
hocking that chunk of green unless you
knew emeralds youd never believe it
was the real mccoy suddenly he sat
up

  mrs barclay

  yes

  all it takes is what you call a binder
to make this agreement of sale a sound
transaction

  that is right she hitched herself
back in the love seat smoothed her skirt
down over those trim legs but i need
not go that far i can always call for more
time to consider

  she still wasnt sold on nureddins
idea and i wondered if he could talk her
into slapping five or ten grand on the line
she was no ones dummy as long as
emotion prodded her shed carry on but
soon shed cool off

  nureddin took the ring from his finger
he held it looking at it himself turning
it a little until it was a great ball of live
green under themights

  he said i noticed that this held your
interest mrs barclay would you care
to examine it

  oh i hadnt really-

  she meant she hadnt realized she had
eyed it so openly that hed noticed her
before she knew it the ring was in her
hand her brows pulled together just a
little and her mouth became o-shaped

  why its genuine its marvelous i
never saw not even at shreves-

  few people can believe that it is
genuine mrs barclay the emperor of
all india shah jahan gave it to one of
my ancestors nearly three hundred years
ago the appraiser at shreves tried to
tempt me but how did you recognize
this stone

  i have a few very small ones mr
ali

  her fingers curled a little she hated
to return it he did not reach for it he
let her caress that old gold that smooth
deep green it seemed to wink in the
light-


  try it on your middle finger mrs
barclay it takes a womans smooth
white skin to do it justice

  it was a loose fit it did look swell
then he got up and uncorked the
play give westfield a check to bind
the bargain give him five thousand ten
thousand enough so that he will know
you are not trifling

  i will leave shah jahans emerald
with you as a hostage mrs barclay in
case my advice goes to your disadvan-
tage if in a week you say i was wrong
sell the emerald to whatever jeweler can
give you its value

  she-was on her feet now first looking
down at the ring and then up at
nureddin this is to assure me that you
are working for me and not for mr
westfieldv

  just that perhaps you had best call
your lawyer to assist with the papers
but do not let him persuade you against
a substantial payment

  he bowed touched his fingertips to his
forehead now we must leave before
mr westfield calls

cor a second the widow stopped look-
ing fascinated by the emerald she
was frightened oh but i cant run the
risk this stone is worth the whole im-
port company suppose-

  i do not worry mrs barclay it has
been stolen several times in the past few
centuries but no thief has ever been
happy with it good evening mrs bar-
clay

he didnt give her a chance to go with
us to the door he left her standing there
with lord knows how many thousand
dollars worth of splendor on her finger
i didnt know what to say

  when i started booting the bus up the
grade nureddin took command take
this locomotive back to your lot and get
me something small black and common
something that will keep a man from
realizing that he is being followed
there wasnt anything i could say after
seeing him risk-and dont tell me there
wasnt any risk-an emerald as big as a
goose egg just to get anne jordans dad
out of the district attorneys paws

  already i had a hunch wed be hang-
ing the sign of mr seven on someone
that night

  not within the week but that night or
at least the one after

  just where mrs barclays check for
five thousand would come in i couldnt
guess but its a cinch nureddin wasnt
playing when he tossed shah jahans
emerald to a strange woman

vi

knce nureddin got a v- from my lot
 he went back to watch mrs barclays
house he said there might be a lot of
sleep lost that there was no need of me
watching with him and that it was about
time someone saw anne so i phoned
her and drove over

  anne was pretty low before i got a
chance to tell her what nureddin was
cooking up she started off theyre
working on dad wearing him down
keeping him awake

  no i couldnt see him but i know
theyre trying to make him tell where he
put the tanks of gas and the torch and
that fool of a lawyer-

  she doubled over in the big needle-
point chair and began crying into her
hands i knelt beside her and patted her
shoulder whatd he do

  thats it she choked a little noth-
ing just nothing running around in
circles oh i know what hes working
for trying to find out if we have enough

money for an appeal thats obvious

  appeal wait till hes indicted

  no but he will be that fools been
suggesting that dad take a plea claim
self-defense claim he was drunk in-
sanity by reason of drunkenness or
something like that

  huh even manslaughter with a
breaking and entering would amount to
capital punishment a couple years of
san quentin would kill him that lawyer
is afraid to risk a not guilty and getting
either an acquittal or else the works for
his client he isnt really selling you
down the river

  oh he isnt well it amounts to just
that

  i hated to see her cutting up that way
but i didnt want to tell her about
nureddins combination play mainly be-
cause i didnt see how all this finagling
around was going to work i had a deep
hunch it would or nureddin would not
toss the emperors emerald around casu-
ally

  but spilling that chinese angle wouldnt
help anne and it might hurt nureddin
all i could say was nureddins cooking
up something tonight hes watching a
suspect

  who she sat up straight

  westfield do you know there was
something odd about that cutting job i
dont know why i didnt think of it be-
fore

  that door was cut from the inside
you can tell by the way the slag from
hot metal the-oxides you know stick on
the edge furthest from where the torch
nose is held

  your dad didnt have a key did he

  of course he didnt dean he turned
everything in but that didnt last long
her smile faded and her face dropped
theyll say he had a duplicate made
and threw it away when he finished the
job

hhen i left anne i began to wonder
 if nureddin had noticed that the door
had been cut from the inside i kept won-
dering all the next day

  and when he did phone that night
there was no chance to ask him for once
he was in a hurry

  meet me where hunters point avenue
curves at the ships graveyard quick
ill be in the v- right at the end of the
bend

  he hung up i stuffed a  into my
pocket and took off i went out third
street and a-helling across china basin
channel the district is all warehouses
gasoline storage dumps freight sheds
with the big aluminum tank of the pa-
cific gas  electric commanding the
works

  after dark there is not a dimes worth
of traffic though every once in a while
a fellow bopping out of a cross street can
line you up for a complete overiiaul

  nothing hit me and no cops noticed
me a switch engine just missed taking
off a rear fender but i won a few sec-
onds for the risk and i thanked nured-
dins allah when i saw that the bridge
at islais channel wasnt even thinking
of lifting to let a barge go through

  then i poured her around the curve
at evans avenue going so fast that the
smell of rubber killed the slaughter-
house bouquet

  the bus was steaming like old faithful
smoky joe hadnt filled the radiator i
booted her till she pounded the pistons
seized i was so sore i didnt think of
cussing running took too much breath

  it wasnt a long sprint past the power
substation and the pile drivers ferry
boats and barges rotting in the salt flats
of india basin squatters lived in some of
the derelicts the long-abandoned boats

   not that i saw all this as i ran i knew
 that tumble-down corner and wondered
 what family nureddin had tangled with
 who he had spotted

  he must have heard my hoofs or my
 breathing before i could spot the make
 of the car parked at the far end of the
 curve i saw a turban in the dark

   nureddin said if you ran all the way
 from home you did nicely

  which way

  he pointed around the corner the
 old brewery

 rphe square tower reached maybe thir-
 ty feet up from the side hill it was
 a skeleton and only the walls of the sub-
 structure were standing what was left
 was solid masonry built years ago

 td often seen it while driving out to
 the sea food joints a mile or so beyond
 there were tunnels leading way into the
 middle of the hill drifted into rock
 lagering vaults for beer at one time
 where dti come in i hefted the 
 put it away youre merely a witness
 you had your guts going to the near-
 est phone your men couldve ducked
 out and gotten away

  not with what he was doing

  he funny i hadnt asked him
 sooner who

   westfield

   so it wasnt the chinaman after all i
 followed nureddin up the slope and
 across the three-by-twelves that hadnt
 rotted ahead it was black as a squaws
 pocket we were in an artificial cave i
 was afraid even to whispr so i couldnt
 ask him how about a flash light

  that would rave been wasted breath
 there was a light far in a column or
 angle or something blocked all but the
 indirect glow i heard a funny sound
 familiar but hard to name also a pour-
 ing and sloshing

  we were on concrete paving now i
 walked like a cat on eggs and it seemed
 i made more noise than a junk wagon
 nureddin might have been a ghost or
 the devil

   yeah the devil come to think of it i
 never forgot the time he made a hindu
 murderer hang himself

   that yell ahead of us convinced me that
 satan had popped up i didnt know a
 man could make a sound like that
 choked but shrill tearing the guys
 throat i drew my gun and followed the
 turban though running the other way
 would have been more fun

  we swung around a corner and did i
 nearly drop when i saw what was in the
 half-masked light of a battery lantern

   westfield was there backed against the
 wall his hands high and dripping his
 good-fellow face all gray his chin sagged
 to his chest

  there were four-five empty boxes and
 about as many not emptied fifty-sixty
 cans with the lids slashed open that
 explained the funny sounds id heard at
 first

   the floor was stacked with green apri-
 cots and flowing with syrup that drip-
 dripped into a drainage channel to our
 right i could hear the dripping because
 the only other sound was westfields
 breathing

   then i felt like westfield there were
 chinamen there with knives and drawn
 guns all but one stood back in the
 shadows so not a face was plain

  the one coming toward westfield when
 we barged in was kwong li

  kwong li smiling that me klistian
 chinaman smile he used when cutting
 down a highbinder had come out of his
 gaudy coffin

i was so shocked i saw things id not
have noticed otherwise right away
there were pearls near the green apri-
cots great big shining pearls on a piece
of flannel

  westfield had been cutting open the
cans until he found the one that was
loaded with more than fruit

nureddin stopped the parade west-
field yelled dont let em kill me
kwong li said you catchee aplicot
nureddin answered no sawee apli-
cot me catchee him fellow chop-chop
maskee no see you belong dead

  kwong li scooped up the pearls as
near as i could get the pidgin english
nureddin meant i want the guy not the
loot and whats more i didnt see you
youre dead

  granting that chinamen are lousy
shots and that i had a gun it still was
tactful but i was worried we knew too
much and how long before kwong li
began to consider ways and means
smuggled pearls would interest the cus-
toms officials

  i was still shaking when the yellow
wave drew back looped around and
slipped along the further wall heading
back to the road and by then west-
field could speak

  whyd you let those devils get away
they murdered my partner i trailed one
of them to the loot the others surprised
me

  a good yarn first class nureddin
took it with a smile and said you
opened the cans when you found them
suspecting of course that such useless
booty must contain smuggled valuables
certainly but who are you ive seen
you before

  nureddin ali at kwong lis funeral

i have been watching you ever since mrs
hewitt barclay gave you that check
what what that shook him
yes that check westfield the one i
asked her to give you so that you would
have a reasonable excuse to leave town
with the pearls you kept instead of shar-
ing them with kwong li

  when mrs barclay offered to buy
your interest in the warehouse you were
very happy to sell you wanted to leave
san francisco ever since that white
rooster was put on your desk that
faked suicide by kwong li shook you
then i saw the cylinders of acetylene
way off in a dark corner thdje they
are i sounded off the gas the torch
and nureddin said pointing to
westfield here is the man who murdered
hewitt barclay the man who faked a
robbery in a futile attempt to convince
kwong li that the pearls had been stolen
by an outsider not by an accomplice

  barclay surprised you westfield while
you were robbing your own warehouse
so you hit him with a pinch bar

  youre crazy you cant prove it-the
police cant- he laughed youre
whacky you damn turk

  nureddin shrugged in your ward-
robe is a pair of trousers and a pair of
shoes all peppered with droplets of iron
on them molten iron spattering from a
torch cut drops so fine that they can
burn through your socks and you scarce-
ly feel them on your skin

  even if there is not one fingerprint on
the torch those clothes finish you mr
westfield

  he tried to make a break and i conked
him with my gun barrel nureddin said
that was needless i have sabotaged his
parked car up the block a call to the
police would bring a squad to search his
house long before he could get home

  oh well give me a hand and well
carry him

  before we packed him out i stepped
over for a look at the cutting equipment
any man who wasnt a positive runt
could handle the stuff

  westfield had snitched a wc size
acetylene tank which weighs only a lit-
tle over ninety pounds and a k size
oxygen cylinder which is the midget of
its family

  i said to nureddin he wouldnt need
a helper to take this stuff out of his car
and into the warehouse and then back
again to bring it out here and ditch it

nureddin eyed westfield listened to
his breathing and smiled in that
gentle-assassin way of his this man
will not know his own name for the next
several days i fear but please continue
explanations

   nothing left to say i said it all
 pardon me but not all and not totally
 accurate he did not have to remove
 tanks from his powerful and costly car
 he had merely to pass the torch and hose
 through a ventilator near the eaves then
 go into the warehouse and start cutting
 now be pleased to assist with this-
 the word is cold meat

  when we dumped westfield into his
own car nureddin opened the luggage
compartment which had an automatic
light inside

  he pointed and said see the black
paint that flaked off the acetylene cylin-
der see the scraping of green enamel
from the oxygen cylinder also bits of
red earth from the construction job where
he stole these things

  now be pleased to drive to the near-
est telephone i will wait with the pris-
oner

   that settled it and the rap stuck west-
field squawked about the pearls but
kwong li didnt have them and didnt
know who did-that was his story

  he claimed he had been helping fellow
tong brothers and he didnt have the fog-
giest idea of what the score was-and he
got away with that

  nureddin figured that it wasnt his
business helping the customs officials all
he was concerned about was to get his
emerald back from mrs barclay and get
annes dad out of the jug he did both

  you see he told me later it was
simple first that torch cut was from
the inside of the warehouse so that the
glare would not attract a possible passer-
by or switch engine crew but for the
murder that followed that detail would
not have been important

  then there was the way the chinese
let westfield get to the coffin but kept
us away westfield already worried by
the so-called suicide of the man hed
gypped wouldnt notice that the supposed
corpse was not totally dead

   all these and gossip from a couple of
chinese moslems gave me my suspicions
there was a sly smile and he went on
finally the funeral before the corpse
was cold an old time chinese is not
buried until the jeng shut men the sooth-
sayers pick a lucky day

  westfield knew chinese customs but
he did not think clearly being worried
by his conscience worried about the un-
intended killing of barclay and by the
threat implied by kwong lis suicide-
for-vengeance

   very simple for an oriental like my-
self

   it was just as simple as the way i sold
anne a reconditioned guaranteed a cou-
ple days after she never drives it be-
cause shes got too many boy friends
with cars

   there may be justice in the world but
where do i come in

this he growled

g unswift

 by jack byrne

cass gentry coming to triangle town
with his partner swifty ogden finds that
his job is to untangle a sinister web of mys-
tery a professional gun-hand gentry quick-
ly decides that the best technique is to start
rattling triangles skeletons only thus will
he be able to probe the murder of
matt mchale the owner of the rocker-m
ranch who was shot down and robbed a year
before since his death the rocker-m herd
has been severely raided by rustlers and nest-
ers have over-run the range taking advantage
of the new homestead law the inheritance of
mary ellen mchale the dead ranchers
daughter has dwindled almost to nothing de-
serted by her fiance the smooth young lawyer
martin burdette mary has found refuge in
the home of one of her few remaining friends
dr george farabaugh she is a companion for
the doctors wife ada a crippled and embit-
tered woman also loyal to mary is bearpaw
a grizzled veteran of the rocker-m

ollie shand cattle-thief is the man most
generally suspected of matt mchales
murder for mchale and his men strung up
shands father yet it is shand who saves the
lives of gentry and ogden when they ride
into an ambush by kettledrum river shand
kills the ambusher

tex cordill formerly the ramrod on the
rocker-m now a tool of the mysterious tri-
angle combine only a few minutes after the
killing gentry and the others see a man ap-
proach the body of cordill and take from it
a thick sheaf of bills then he rides away
but shand has recognized him to be
vic barth deputy sheriff in triangle
barths crony is wash parsons the mayor
and gentry has no particular suspicion of that

oeeiy man until he witnesses a secret meeting
between parsons and a buck-toothed stranger
out on the range suspicion grows when cass
discovers that buck-tooth the wearer of a
snakeskin hatband played some part in a
rustler raid

frank irish triangles shrewd banker
cannot explain to cass why matt mchale
left behind him so meager an estate he had
considered mchale a wealthy man irish
warns gentry to take it slow and easy in his
probing of triangles mystery but cass be-
lieves in the use of dynamite so he roughly
handles

ben quigg the rabbity sheriff demanding
to know what happened to the bills taken by
vic barth from cordills body could that be
the same money that was stolen from the
murdered mchale a year before continuing
to push the fight gentry knocks around sev-
eral cowhands from the snaketrack ranch
owned by

abel bannister an old enemy of matt mc-
hale it is suspected that bannister may have
a hand in the rustling of the rocker-m herd
and now cass serves notice on him that he
will have some explaining to do

hop randolph gambler was once the
suitor for mary ellen mchales hand and
he had cause to hate old matt mchale but
cass somehow trusts this bitter heavy-drink-
ing man he believes him when the gambler
says he had nothing to do with the murder
randolph has a savage distrust for mairtin
burdette but he will not explain why and
cass gentry has been unable to shake the glib
poise of the young lawyer

triangle contains two secondary mysteries

which are puzzling what is the englishman
talbot doing in town and who supplies
duke costello with money and why is the
man drinking himself to death   

one night while cass gentry is stabling a
horse in the farabaugh bam mary ellen mc-
hale comes to him there and she tells him
that to have him as an ally has given her new
strength they are talking when a gun ex-
plodes in the night outside and only cass
split-second lunge saves the girl from the bul-
let intended for her   

chapter xvi

light is danger

c ass gentry shot out the lantern

he was twisting toward the girl to
a shield her as he fell he was kick-
ing the hampering bench aside he was
hooking his weapon out of the leather
and pointing it by blind reckoning and
fingering the trigger-all these swift func-
tions packed into that heartbeat interval
between the instant that mary ellen was
driven back and the instant following
when cass gentry sprawled on the stable
flooring

the echoes of the gunblast that had
buzzed a bullet between them were still
pounding the stable walls when cass fired
his answer he shot at their greatest
danger the light that would expose them
to a following attack and his heavy slug
shattered the glass knocked metal clank-
ing brought down the curtain of dark-
ness

he fired and he rdled his body wildly
in the gloom his free hand sought for
mary ellen to warn her somehow against
any movement any faintest noise his
fingers touched her face and two hands
tightened on his wrist and pulled his palm
against her cheek

this story began in the argosy for february 

 
  she had sensed his message in those
tense seconds of waiting he could feel
the warmth of her breath and the silken
softness of her parted lips his muscle-
ridged arm marked the slow lift of her
breast in tempo with his own soft inhala-
tions he was propped on elbow and hip
and the muzzle of his colts was posed to
cover any stir from the blacker blot of
the doorway

  for more than a minute the frozen
tableau held a shake of his wrist sig-
naled mary ellen to loose her grip then
and cass lifted in a crouch he crossed
to the doorway swiftly huddled at the
opening to peer into the bare expanse of
yard

  the kitchen light still burned in the
house and in the shadowed space be-
tween he could see or hear nothing as
he watched however a second light
flared in an upper room a muffled voice
called out then lifted in sharper alarm

  the girl had crept after him its mrs
farabaugh she whispered ive got to
go to her-

  stick close beside me cass said
scared off i guess whoever it was
the  jutted from his hand moving with
the slow turn of his head that searched
the night mary ellens shoulder rubbed
his arm as they crossed to the kitchen
entrance

  lock that door when you get inside
cass said grimly til look around the
back here

  she nodded mrs farabaugh was shrill-
ing her name and she called out reas-
surance cass gave the gun a savage jerk
as he turned that singing bullet had
whizzed as close to her head as to his
own he thought of the roan horse foun-
dered on the creek bank and the image
of what might have happened on that
stable bench twitched his mouth with
rage

  who were they what murderer had
been prowling there at which of them
had the skulking gun been aimed-at cass
gentry or mary ellen

  he had scarcely begun to search the
shadows when sounds from the street in-
terrupted dr farabaugh came hurrying
along the driveway a long-striding giant
with bearpaw humping behind him

  did those shots come from this way
gentry he hailed whats up man
why are all my lights burning

  some kind friend took a shot at me
cass said with no harm done i was
just about to strike a light and see if any
trace might been left behind im afraid
the grounds too wet though

  i told yuh bearpaw exclaimed
when them shots cracked off i said to
the doc they sounded from his direction
wheres ellie

  cass told the story briefly while lan-
terns were being lighted in the stable
old bearpaw rumbled a string of exple-
tives and farabaughs hand huge and
hairy made a convulsive snatching mo-
tion

  it was something like this i was afraid
of he said thin-voiced i-we-it cant
go on he turned to stare toward the
lights of the house perhaps id better
see if theres something to be done for
mrs farabaugh

the soggy turf had no evidence the
amber lights could find the stable
verged on a narrow alley that was irreg-
ularly lined with sheds and fences and
the would-be killer might have ap-
proached from any direction or have van-
ished into countless dark hidings there
had been ample time for getaway cass
thought in that interval when the threat
of further attack had forced him to play
possum

  mightve been anybody he said dully

i saw no more than a ghost in the dark
heavy-caliber pistol id judge from the
sound-which is just about all we got to
go on theres nothin more we can do
here mudded tracks wouldnt tell us
much nohow whereabouts were you
when you heard the shots

  over town-corner of division street

i seen the doc turn out of tlere an him
an me was passin the time-

  what i meant was cass said that
if we knew certain people stood else-
where at the time at least wed know
who didnt do it how long you been
over town

  i stayed close here bearpaw protest-
ed until she blew her light out she
tried to run me off-

  it wasnt your fault cass said i
drew the fire on her moren anybody
he thumbed his chin has vic barth
showed up lately

  not that i know i aint seen im
men swifty been hangin out like yuh
told us watchin who talked with who an
what little things went on wampum
streets still waxin strong the biggest
crowds at venables an swiftys watch-
in that high-stake sattidy game they
hold there

  who could you account for when the
shots cracked off and maybe a little be-
fore

         -bearpaw pushed back his
 soggy hat-i sat on the step of the
travelers house just before that time
to roll me a smoke les see now   
ben quigg was snorin drunk in his cub-
byhole an that big dutchman of his was
runnin duke costello out of the happy
hour so as to head off a fight the duke
genally delivers speeches around this
hour of mornin an gits overloud the
party at eli lombards had split up an
five or six come down the hill for a night-
cap

  was burdette along

  he was damn im bearpaw said
him an frank irish an henry gaunt
an some others they passed me close
mr fancy-pants burdette said hed step
across to his office to pick up some papers
an join em at the wheel of fortune
later he-

  whats the matter cass said
funny said bearpaw it never
struck me before from where i was on
the street id shorely notice his office light
up he crossed tords the buildin pud-
dle-jumpin but i cant recall any lamp
that lit upstairs there

  martin burdette night-prowling that
slick young lawyer risking his handsome
skin to further some sly scheme he had
the odds were against it yes but it still
remained a possibility

  who else was around cass asked
the snaketrack bunch are mainly at
the happy hour cuttin high-jinks that
hook-nosed feller yuh run in with is one
of bannisters high-priced gunhands they
say he didnt take to the way yuh han-
dled im i reckon he was talkin mighty
big a little earlier curlin quite a kink
into his tail

  cass nodded there was no telling who
might have seen him ride into town with
the doctor plenty enough time had
elapsed while he was putting up the
buggy and tending the doctors horse
for word of his return to be passed along
two minutes walk cutting the back lots
would fetch a man from wampum street
to the stable

  there wasnt much doin on the
street bearpaw said the rain kept em
close in the shank of the evenin an i -
know from the days when i was frisky
that a drinkin man or a gamblin man er

whatever else dont change his stand
much after midnight

  i did see hop randolph come out fer
a breather walk an venable went look-
in from place to place to see what trade
the rest was doin an wash parsons
waddled off somewheres-

 what time was that cass said
sharply

  why i dunno jest latterly it was
five-ten minnits before i run into the
doc

  cass lifted his shoulders let them sag
its like i first said-it might been any-
body it could been some stranger we
never heard tell of you might stop at
the house and see if shes-if theyre all
right in there mis farabaugh took a real
big scare from the way she sounded
shes sickly bearpaw said been
crippled up fer years i shorely pity her
if she has to stand these doggone miseries
i git in my bones when it turns this kind
of rainy weather

  see you cass said ill go and hunt
up swifty

he traveled the alley the lights
of wampum street had a brighter
shine in the clearing air and he stood
briefly to look and listen

  at this dim hour the thoroughfare again
wore the haggard guise he remembered
from his pre-dawn stroll the black
hulks of houses straggled forlornly
though now they were spotched with
lighted squares and oblongs six saloons
still running open in this one block cass
counted and more beyond

  he walked toward the biggest light the
noisiest light toward the wheel of for-
tune and a secretive whistle hailed him
midway along he halted turning and
the young un stepped out from the
shadow of a wall

  youd already passed he said be-
fore i could make you out i thought
you was opt of town mr gentry
youre slippin cass said i come
back a little spell ago as others seemed
to notice what you cattin around for
this hour of night young stuff your
age should be long in bed

  i had to let somebody know said the
boy i couldnt find bearpaw and id
give myself away if i tried to catch
swiftys eye in venables i went out to
the shack-

  whats up cass muttered

 vic barths back the young un
breathed i figgered youd want to know

i aint see im-he aint showed his face
around-but his white-footed horse is in
the spur corrals and his saddle too been
there moren a hour

chapter xvii

wheel oe fortune

cass moved slowly along the bar in
the wheel of fortune the big room
was heavy with warmth with stale scents
with a smoky haze that eddied against
the rafters it buzzed with a drone of
talk a murmur of small related sounds

 the long bar was well lined cass
counted eight tables of poker big and
small in session against the north wall
a wheel of roulette was spinning and a
birdcage layout had ten or twelve gath-
ered around there were a pair of faro
boards where twenty or more bucked the
tiger

  cass gentrys entrance caused no stir
no special notice that he could discover
at this hour of night the drinkers were
too deep in their drinks and their talk
the gamblers too absorbed in their games
to be easily distracted cass was passing
toward the rear toward the table where


the thickest ring of watchers were gath-
ered

  he saw familiar faces hop randolph
was dealing from a faro box and martin
burdette was one of a group at a bar-
side table some quality in cass gentrys
stare must have transmitted its message
for the young lawyer turned his head as
cass was moving past in that quick
clash of glances cass thought he could
detect a flicker of emotion

  cass hesitated deliberately his gaze
traveled down to burdettes tight-fitting
trouser leg to the mudded boot it was
possible that a man might splash himself
so in crossing the puddled street such
spatter-marks might also be acquired in
running the alley shadows

  shrugging cass strode on two-thirds
of the boots and brogans in triangle
town would be muck-browned to some
extent and the scrapings of them all
would not assay a single ounce of proof

  swifty ogden saw him coming he
edged through the ring of spectators at
the big table and the tilt of his head
steered cass aside sudden shifts of plan
and tactics were the usual course in any
deal where cass gentry was concerned
and swifty accepted his presence without
question they found elbow-room along
the rear wall

  theres a man in the game swifty
said who was huntin the town for you
around supper time abe bannister they
call im and he looks like he might be
hard to throw

   thats fine said cass ill spare im
further lookin what else goes on
there was quite a stir a while ago
some gent busted in to holler that night
riders was loose up north bannisters
leadin a bunch to look into it come day-
light theres been talk of necktie parties
and the whole county gangin up to wipe
out ollie shand

   yeah said cass its a loud-talkin
town looks like they got a good-sized
game there

  real good swifty muttered he
touched the fading bruise that ringed his
eye wagging his head if i could put
my hands on a stake of money    he
sighed but i reckon its just as well
theyve stepped the bets beyond a bank-
roll of my caliber since that little banker-
man of yours sat in

  you mean frank irish

  he took a chair about a hour back
they say he plays here once a week and
id tell a man he knows his poker he
bets em both ways-when hes got em
and when he hopes to git em that brick-
faced englishmans dropped one pile
aready and had to ramble out to collect
fresh money

   lets have a look cass said and they
circled the cordon of onlookers to find a
vantage that would put their backs
against the wall

stud-horse poker was the game and
seven players sat at the big round
table dan venable a lean and angular
man of middle years banked this high-
stakes table each saturday night

  a thousand dollar stack was the mini-
mum requirement and the final hand was
customarily dealt at the crack of dawn
it was a gentlemans game-traveling
deal no cut to the house no side bets
permitted the biggest men in the nearby
country were frequent participants

  tonight was representative the scar-
faced man swifty whispered was one of
the get-rich-quick crowd from plateau
there was a mining man from deadwood
a cigar-chewing redhead who owned a
rival establishment down the street and
a stocky brown-skinned man in a bow-
ler hat who sat dourly between venable



and frank irish showing no interest

  wheres the englishman cass mur-
mured

  he aint come back thats his man
friday holdin down his chair take no-
tice of that froze-face jigger cass i
overheard im talkin earlier and you
cant hardly sawy a word he says his
mouths full of prickle-burrs

  i pieced out enough though to hit on
one point that struck me funny aint
this englishman supposed to be a minin
man if thats the case why is his meal-
mouthed right bower so doggone nosey-
cass jogged his arm he was shifting
for a view of the seventh man and over
an intervening shoulder he had his first
sight of the snaketrack boss abel ban-
nister

  swifty had called the man right cass
thought bannister had the look of a
critter who would be hard to rope and
tough to throw a bull-muscled neck was
set on a body that was thickly layered
with strength his coppery face was
broad harshly lined blunt featured his
pouched eyes wrinkled now against the
reflected shine of the swing-lamp above
the table inspected his layout of cards
with suspicion he glared at the man who
had bet five yellow chips on his ace-king
in sight

call yuh he growled i swallowed
down enough damn bluffs for one night
and up another five hundred said
frank irish briskly ive got to protect
this little straight i aim to fill

  thats what i mean swifty muttered
a ten-spots his highest up-card yet he
bets em as if he had the table beat hes
lucky too wait and see if the final fall
dont pair im

  and so it happened the fifth card
gave the banker sevens over tens to beat
bannisters back-to-back queens

  i got second sight frank irish
crowed i could see that seven cornin
deal the cards the rancher growled
it aint your winnin frank that i mind
so much as it is the fact that you always
got to be so right about ever little thing
that happens

til et me through here a high voice
l commanded and cass saw the pink
face of talbot as the tall englishman
pushed through the watchers his pale
eyes were angry beneath yellow brows
and he spoke with jerky impatience

  sorry gentlemen sorry never like to
delay the proceedings very good low-
ery take this coat will you and have
them send a fresh glass

  he settled in the chair that his dour
companion vacated produced a sheaf of
squarish currency from his fuzzy jacket
pounds sterling he announced no
objection i trust i am playing five thou-
sand of your dollars

  fresh money said the man from
deadwood shake up that deck and let
me at it

  wasted a confounded hour the eng-
lishman muttered stupid fellow at the
inn wasnt on hand to open his strong-
box had to chase all about in your
beastly muck   eh whats that oh
yes yes certainly

  he cut the deck that the dealer had
pushed toward him

  cass stared at the long-faced britisher
talbots present attire from white stock
to glossy puttees showed no evidence of
muddy wanderings was it over-sharp
imagination which made cass think that
the englishmans public announcement
had been too elaborate

  the cards had been flipped around the
board when the first betting came to
frank irish he folded his hand i pass
the buck he said ive no mind to quit

winner gentlemen but youd better deal
around me for the next few hands
theres a man i got to see can you spare
a minute abe

   me  said the rancher hell no ill
hike your bet there five blues mister
what man-what for

   frank irish was showing his wise grin
why the man you been lookin for he
said i thought if you had the time abe
id make you acquainted with cass gen-
try whos standin back in the crowd
there

chapter xviii

whisper the dawn

aflutter ran through the ringed
watchers-bodies shifting heads
turning feet shuffling men shrank away
as abel bannisters chair grated the floor-
ing and as cass stepped a half-pace back-
ward to merge with his shadow against
the wall

   it was a queerly strained situation a
small drama suddenly set in motion by
the little bankers ironic stagecraft any-
thing might have stemmed from it cass
thought though the actual eventuality
was the development he least expected

   the snaketrack boss came to his feet
he leaned forward his head thrust ag-
gressively and confronted cass with a
black-browed glare

your name gentry he demanded

   so i been told said cass

   i been lookin for you gentry the
bull-necked man said with heavy empha-
sis to make some statements plain the
first is that any snaketrack hand from
the boss on down who hooraws a woman
on the public street-he deserves whats
cornin if id been in your boots this
evenin mister id dosed them hammer-
heads of mine with the selfsame medicine
you dealt out or more so

   he slapped the table thats that
gentry the second thing is tex cordill

i hired im for the simple reasons that
he savvies cattle and knows this country
and needed a job

   if he mixed into crookedness at the
rocker which youve hinted around it
was none of my affair if he taken a pot-
shot at you as you claim it wasnt done
by snaketrack orders is that plumb
clear

   i never stated otherwise cass said 
quickly

   but while were at it bannister
rushed on lets git the whole fandango
straight where is cordill and what ex-
actly happened with you and him at the
kettledrum

   i left it to the sheriff to look into
that cass said you mean to tell me-
i mean its time to back your talk with
some facts bannister said gruffly you
words no bettern the next mans here in
triangle gentry bluff and blow cuts no
ice with me

   the bunch that looked over the six
pole ford did find some signs of skirmish
there was spent shells a spot of blood
and cordill aint been seen since he head-
ed out yonderly since its one of my
hands accused ill trouble you for the
plain story mister

   so that had been vic barths sly dodge
doubling back hiding cordills body-
it was a cleverness cass should have fore-
seen by that one little stunt the deputy
had reduced the bushwhacking incident
to a question of cass gentrys evidence
against his own

   cass instantly saw the dangers of the
situation we was shot at from the
bank he said costellos boy can prove
that cordill chased after us his picture
tallies with what we saw of the man be-


hind the bushwhack gun we shot im
down-

  you killed im bannister demanded
 we left im for dead cass said
 looks like we might been mistaken
 though since he up and gone

  bannister eyed him suspiciously
 smells damn queer tjo me he said
 whats this talk of vic barth bein in on
 it robbin money from tex vic says
 hes never set eyes on you and he aint
 seen cordill for days

  i reckon thats for barth and me to
 argue cass said grimly ill attend that
 little matter right away

bannister grunted theres one
more thing gentry he said if you
got some notion of lockin horns with me
theres no call to weasel-foot this after-
noon you spoke a question to my boys
that a bunch of other damn fools been
mumblin ill answer it here and now

  there aint no skunktrack mystery in
 the way ive held my losses down its
 been done by spendin money by hirin
 extra hands and ridin double shifts i
 aint been licked gentry and i wont be
 licked so long as i still got strenth to
 fight we got plans laid-

   easy abe frank irish called out i
 suggest we finish this in venables office
 ill hold my tongue the burly rancher
 growled its a sign what triangles
 come to when a honest man cant speak
 his mind unless behind locked doors its
 a fine fix when the law lies drunk and
 thieves rob us blind to hell with tri-
 angle i say when weve cleaned out the
 devils pocket well ride back here and
 finish the job

   frank irish had sidled around the table
 to grip his arm men had come cluster-
 ing from the reaches of the silenced room
 to listen perhaps abel bannister realized
 that his anger had led him to crow too
 loud for he permitted the little banker
 to push him aside 

  come along here gentry irish di-
 rected lets use what heads we got on
 our shoulders yonders the office

  in the narrow rear room they faced
 each other briefly silent abel bannister
  stood near the desk fists on hips cass
 lounged in the angle near the window
 white-tufted frank irish peered at them
 with his monkeys half-grin

   i seem to be the middle-man he said
 lets see what profit i can shave out of
 bringin you two together you asked
 some questions concernin abe today
 gentry nows your chance to git the
 straight of em

  i know what talks been passed
 around bannister said plenty fingers
 pointed tords me when matt mchale was
 rubbed out and its a fact i had no cause
 to love im like a brother his rocker
 was as good a layout as mine-some ways
 better mebbe-and any cattleman would
 like to own it

  i never had no idea though that my
 legs spread wide enough to straddle both
 propositions if i did have it was knocked
 plumb out of me by them storms last fall
 it may be that the snaketrack wasnt hit
 as hard as some but we was hurt a-plen-
 ty

   ive seen the books abe keeps frank
 irish said and thats the gospel

   i never did have cash enough to swing
 both irons said bannister im spread
 out too thin right now and unless the
 market stays high my next shipments
 wont hardly cover the money ive had
 to borrow theres no profit in ranchin
 this country the way things stand and
 there never will be until we clean that
 nest of thieves from the pocket

  you got any private notion who
 mightve murdered mchale  cass asked

   private bannister snorted hell
 man any fool knows it was ollie shand
 that yaller-headed ferret had his trap
 long baited for matt and nobody will tell
 me different that boys more pure poison
 than old milo ever was

   hes got twenty men hid out in that
 badlands maze and its a salty crew for
 the last year gentry them devils have
 been gettin rich while honest men eke
 out on their leavins

   bes got good reason to feel like he
 -f- does about devils pocket irish
 said his youngest boy was in town that
 day before christmas when matt mchale
 collected his vigilantes rex was feelin
 his drinks i guess and rode along with
 the bunch he was one of the three that
 wa shot in passiti through the notch
 he died later

   bannisters face hardened it was the
 kids bad luck he said harshly i did
 hold it hard against mchale for a while-
 lettin a boy of eighteen trail into a mess
 like that-but i got over it

   ill admit i never wept too hard when
 matt was paid off i didnt lift a finger
 either when the rockers tail was bein
 twisted later ive come to see though
 that we made a mistake what happened
 to matts girl was a sign of what would
 come down on the rest of us if we didnt
 keep our horns sharp

   abes got his organization pretty well
 along said the little banker hes hired
 on a bunch of fightin hands and every
 day sees more of the smaller ranchers
 decide to throw in with him hell be all
 fixed shortly to smoke out ollie shand
 and straighten out the problems of the
 county

   i hear you mr foxy bannister
 growled there may be a few snakes in
 town here well need to tromp on later
 and well have to elect some honest law
 but that devils pocket is the first sore
 to be fired and therell never be a bet-
 ter time

   the queer sidelights of this blue hills
 mystery were shuffling again in cass
 gentrys mind he could not doubt abel
 bannisters sincerity and yet he remem-
 bered a similar sincerity in the voice of
 the stubble-chinned man who had hauled
 him from death in the kettledrum roils
 he moved his fingers to brush the lump
 in his pocket-the fold of a rattlesnake
 hatband-and his eyes were gravely
 thoughtful gravely puzzled

   well there you are gentry bannis-
 ter said ive spread my soogans out
 thats how i stand and what i aim to do
 if your job is to hit back at the crowd
 that killed mchale and turned the rocker
 belly-up youre welcome to join us or
 play it lone mister just as you choose
 whats your next move cass asked
 im takin a few boys out tords the
 valleys they had some flurry at the lig
 and well look the ground over as soon as
 it comes light i dont expect to find a
 thing but it offers a chance to line up a
 few of the little stockmen that been jig-
 glin on the fence i likewise intend to
 nose among that ragtag and bobtail bunch
 around burnt mills some think the
 pocket outfit may have lookouts planted
 in there

   i just come dack from out that way
 cass said but i left without any real
 chance to get acquainted if its just the
 same i might travel back along

   suit yourself said abel bannister
  well ride from here about an hour say
 before sun-up

 they rode out in velvet darkness that
 would gradually pale with blue and
 sooty gray into a clear fresh-smelling
 dawn there were six horsemen cass

gentry rode in the van of them beside
abel bannisters stirrup

  with dry clothes on his back with a
catnap to rest him and a good meal under
his belt cass was ready to greet what the
morning offered he had accepted the
ranchers invitation on a spur-of-the-mo-
ment hunch and the hunch seemed to
have more wisdom behind it the more he
he thought it over

  he wanted to see the rocker country
he wanted a better chance to hear the
opinions of  these local men chiefly
however he was pleased with the idea of
getting out of triangle town before he
overplayed his hand

  he had needed the meeting with ban-
nister to jolt him out of the proddy mood
in which he entered the wheel of for-
tune the shock of that bullet which had
missed mary ellens head so close-not
to mention his own-had steamed him up
pretty high

  he had been ready to suspect anybody
and everybody he had read guilt into
burdettes passing glance into the brit-
ishers casual remarks into the mud that
splashed every bootheel it would have
been the same or more so if fat wash
parsons or deputy vic barth had shown
their ugly hides

  and his instinct knew that the hour
was not ripe the time for fist and bullet
was yet to come he could not risk any
harebrained risks for she was depending
on him

  six horsemen riding north from tri-
angle towm 

  the lights they left behind were scant
and weary the wheel of fortune was
the sole remaining sentinel along wam-
pum street and even there the nights
carouse was staggering to its end the
wheels were hooded and swampers were
piling the chairs no more than a hand-
ful of diehards still watched the big-
stakes poker game

  deadwood mans the heavy loser a
bartender muttered to a yawning stick -
man  is ryle henglish ighness hit a
streak that pushed im ten thousand to
the good

  them that has is them that gets the
stickman grumbled   

  at farabaughs house a lone lamp
burned behind the window of the doctors
office the bearded physician sat at his
desk elbows planted wide staring blank-
ly slowly his eyes lifted to the ceiling
and a muscular spasm humped his shoul-
ders his lips firmed and abruptly he
resumed his former task

  from the pigeonholes of the desk he
removed tattered sheafs of papers-let-
ters accounts bills cuttings from medical
journals some he rearranged and re-
placed others were dumped in a waste-
basket

  he used a key to open a small inner
compartment producing a packet that
rubber bands pressed thin the topmost
article was a worn bankbook in which
was recorded the account of george f
smith with the federation bank of
omaha

  dr farabaugh fluttered the pages that
listed substantial and regular deposits
over a period of years and his dark head
made a jerky nod of decision as he fitted
the bankbook packet into his pocket   

and there were lights across town on
division street a low-turned wick
sputtered in the upstairs room of mrs
rambos gray house where the sick girl
slept a moving light descended the stair-
case there and halted at the curtained
doorway of the bay-window parlor

  madame mustache was dressed in a
silken black robe and curl-papers
twigged the pile of her hair she held
her lamp at shoulder height to illumine
the hunched shape on the floor the
crash of a bricabrac stand had hurried
her below

  what are you doing what do you
want get back in your chair and sleep
it off you fool

  costello the drunken duke crawling
the rug on hands and knees turned on
his hip and propped himself with a shiv-
ering arm he looked up emptily

  drink he said lil dram-good fr
beast an good fr man potry he
chuckled and his voice gained momen-
tary distinctness empyrean font he
said the rich theblushful hippocrene
 i beg your pardon lady of shad-
ows most grateful for your hosh-your
hospitality

  it was on the kids account the wom-
an said that i sheltered you from the
rain for all i care you could sleep in
the gutter-muck you root in or six feet
under it you cant stand on your feet
costello theres no place open now to
serve you whisky even if you had
money to pay get back in your chair
ill get money he said my frien
-hell buy a drink my good frien
whos your friend costello she said
sharply who gives you the steady
handouts who keeps you drunk

  he was a shabby mud-caked scare-
crow lying there he was sickly thin and
the skin of his unshaven face was skele-
ton-stretched across the bones hair
ringed down over his forehead and his
sunken grin gave him an idiots look
there was a knowing glint however in
the bloodshot eyes that rolled up at her

  oh no he said slyly my client-
profeshnal confidence-lawyer never
tells thass what im paid for-secret
life n death means big money-thou-
sand-if i work it right 

  wait she said softly ive got a bot-
tle ill brink a drink

  drink he muttered youre my
frien too-my boys frien thass why
im doin this-a stake fr my boy five
thousan i want fr the young un let
em kill me then an i wont care theyd
killed me long ago if they didnt blieve
-he chuckled- that i wrote down what
i still don know

he sat up pawing a hand across his
face big money fr what they think i
know he said and all i really know-
he peered at her owlishly drink-a
lil dram-

and there was one more light briefly
flaring that cass gentry left behind
in triangle town it was- the flame of a
match in the hand of vic barth he
touched it to his cigarette and the glow
painted his features harshly in brights
and shadows then darkness again vic
barth moved on toward the spur cor-
rals

  go home damn you he said to the
bulky blot that trailed at his shoulder
crawl into the hay and whine to your-
self pull the covers to hide your head
but listen vic wash parsons
wheezed i ony want to know where we
stand i got a right-

  the deputy bumped him vic barths
hand clamped on the fat of his compan-
ions shoulder and his quick thrust stag-
gered the heavier man barths voice was
thick with anger

  you got a right to git that blubber-
mouth shut with a bullet he rasped
what damn good are you anyhow if it
hadnt been for you goin off half-cocked
with te cordill-

but im in it as deep as anybody vic
i ought to know whats goin on whats
to be done about gentry how will we-
welldo what were told said barth


its all been figgered out well handle
gentry when were ready theres a little
scheme to settle im when he rides back
to town

  yeah but about the other things i
got to have money i tell you did you
tell im what i said itll take another
thousand-

 now just exactly what said vic
barth slowly have you got itchin up
your sleeve whats been bitin you
lately that you need money so bad
there wouldnt be another little some-
thin would there that you was hidin
out on the boss and me

  no no vic its that bunch at the
mills just like i said they claim that
extra work should bring in extra wages

and i just cant keep stallin im

  ill look into it said the deputy i
may be ridin out that way the thing
is wash that we might be able to clean
this whole slate up within a week or so
the tides runnin strong as you know
if two-three little angles work around
why we might not need a tough crowd
there no longer

  he flipped his cigarette away go on
to bed he said sit tight you fool and
keep your nose clean if you had a brain
in that fat skull youd see what a edge
youre on youre another un wash
who could mighty easy be done without
its a point youd be smart to remem-
ber 

 so much the wan lights saw and the
darkness heard in that dim hour at the
end of night when cass gentry rode one
of six from triangle town

chapter xix

no owls hoot here

they reached their destination in the
brightening dawn and the smell of
coffee greeted them plenty of talk would
follow but as abel bannister had fore-
told there was little actual evidence to
be uncovered at the lig that morning

  as a matter of fact cass thought there
was scant desire for proof from the
general talk every cattleman in the val-
leys was fully convinced that the raiders
came from the devils pocket the
search collected a batch of rifle shells
and revolver casings all of ordinary
make and general usage mudded trail-
signs indicated that the foiled rustlers
had bunched and headed westerly cutting
a beeline for the malpais roughs

  except for ollies crew one puncher
said i dont know a man who wouldnt
lose himself or break his neck in that
country after nightfall this verdict met
with full agreement

  cass had duly explained to bannister
the incidents that led to the shooting of
the roan and had recovered his cached
equipment the lig would cart his extra
gear in the next wagon they sent to town
once again however as with dr fara-
baugh he had concealed his finding of
the snake-banded hat the investigation
of gopher face cass had decided could
best be started through mr wash par-
sons

  the morning passed uneventfully abel
bannister spent most cf his time in
private session with the owners of near-
by spreads and the result of these con-
ferences was -soon common property
cass learned by keeping his ears open
that the vigilantes expected to ride a
hundred strong when they set forth sub-
leaders had been named and gathering
places were discussed

  it was said that bannister expected to
bribe information from certain members
of the devils pocket crew and that he

planned some arrangement to guarantee
that the pocket would never harbor
thieves again

  it was quite a tall order cass thought
as he bided his ease on the lig porch
and waited the dinner-call

  the shand system of rustling as cass
understood it was to pounce down on a
small bunch eight-ten-twelve head and
snake em off fast and quiet it was
supposed that the rustlers had halfway
depots where they held the stuff by day

  under the cover of the following night
they would drive by ambushed trails to
the honeycombed inner valley that could
only be reached through a sheer defile
called the devils notch or gap the
valley was a holding ground where the
brands could be altered or botched

  no one could say for certain how the
shands disposed of their beef though
it was presumed they had connections
with brand owners on the other side of
the malpais who were not too proud to
sniff at a bargain

  it must have been an excellent system
it had been in operation for ten years or
more and old milo shand had always
been careful to space out his raids and
to split his thefts among the various irons
most ranchers had agreed that it was
cheaper to stand the losses than to try
to outwit and outfight milo and he might
have gone on forever if matt mchale
hadnt grabbed the bit in his teeth

  ollie shand-or so it seemed-was
working the same dodge on a much en-
larged scale where milos crew had
never toppedfive or six the estimates of
ollies bunch were variously totaled as
high as thirty it was said that he had
sent his parties into three scattered sec-
tions in a single night the rocker had
lost as many as two hundred head in one
gobble	f

  so cass heard and much more in the
course of an idle morning

when he had eaten and said his
thanks he spoke briefly with ban-
nister the snaketrack boss had an-
nounced he would ride toward burnt
mills very shortly and named a ren-
dezvous cass went on ahead intending
to swing on a pasear that would give him
a clearer picture of what had been the
rocker layout

  from bearpaws map and from the
amount of talk he had heard he had a
good rough outline of the six valleys a
birdseye view would have shown them
in the semblance of a big gnarled extra-
fingered hand the palm was a broken
plateau from which the valleys pronged
toward the humpbacked rise of far hills
and the hazy loom of the badlands peaks
beyond it was a wild-spread section but
cass had already begun to see its pos-
sibilities

  the rocker had grazed the middle
valleys three of them and the home
plant stood on a rise of plain that could
have been likened to the hands knuckle-
ridge summer range at the front door
cass thought and the winter larder
stretched behind he rode close enough
to mark the greener squares of last years
feed fields and the sprawl of barns and
sheds and corrals and holding-pens be-
yond the low-lying main houe

  skeleton ranch-the boneyard of matt
mchales ambitions

  with the sun shining brightly down
the writs and the legal attachments and
the sight-bills and the loans past due
didnt show their plasterings yet they
were there and the rocker would sink
beneath the weight of them into the same
mud-hole that was swallowing many an-
ot r livestock enterprise

  changing days frank irish had pro-
nounced the sands were running out
for the free-range cattle kings

  and he was probably right for all cass
knew new tidies new notions in an-
other ten years this whole wild country
in here might be combed and tamed
posts and wire and plow-patches and the
smoke of chimneys rising through the
hills and if that was the shape of to-
morrow then it might be just as well
that old matthew mchale didnt live to
see it

  one thing certain he was killed just
in time to save him a lot of grief and
disappointment

  it would have galled him to see his
rocker as it stood all tied around with
the laws red tape shuttered and un-
stocked waiting for the final ax to fall
he wouldnt have savvied any more than
cass did how the busy little kingdom he
had fought so hard to build could collapse
so quickly and utterly

  he would still be trying to fight the
law that had sold off the tag of his herds
his horse strings and had installed a
court-appointed stranger in his house to
hold his other belongings safe until the
rightful buzzards snatched them

  sixty cents on the dollar as eli lom-
bard said and whats land worth when
its bordered around by hell

cass shook up the big-headed chest-
rut swinging toward the east along
a hogback ridge his eyes were grimly
thoughtful and the rattlesnake band
rubbed his hip with every saddle jounce
the nesters had scattered throughout the
back valleys but cass had no desire to
see how their three-strand wire had
hacked old matthews erstwhile ranges

  he belonged to the old order too and
wouldnt like seeing that

  he would take the accepted word for
it that they had unloaded helter-skelter
and with the grangers usual boneheaded-
ness had picked the unlikeliest sections
for any sensible crops more important
now was the unofficial headquarters these
new-come pilgrims had established

  he headed that way that was what he
had come to see

  burnt mills lay in the northmost valley
the smallest and roughest of the six
jutting like a crooked thumb and cass
increased his watchfulness as he neared
the vicinity he had no expectation of
danger no inkling of what might be
found ahead but as he approached the
broken land at the end of the plateau
turning to skirt a spit of timber that
angled down to the traveled trail his
vigilance was rewarded

  near the top slope of the ridge beyond
the timber he glimpsed a moving sparkle
it was a flick of light a glitter-gleam and
it came again as he stared

  in the nick of time cass arrested the
dart of his hands toward carbine he
kept the chestnut in the same leisurely
pace the glint he was certain was the
reflection of sun from the spyglass of a
sentinel outpost

  he was not overly surprised it made
him a little more eager though to see
just what brand of nesters it was who
stationed lookouts on the heights above
their nesting place

 was waiting for abel bannister
shortly later when the snaketrack
boss and his trailing riders arrived at the
joint of roads near the last valley mouth
bottles had been passing around at the
lig and a couple of the boys were feel-
ing frisky there was joking and laugh-
ing as the cavalcade moved on

  their boss was sober and determined
but willing to talk

  its a smart ride home bannister

i

said and i dont expect to waste much
time in here ill just leave word with
axton for these hoe-hands to keep their
ears pulled in itll be dangerous travel-
in by night around these parts durin
this next week or so

  you get things fixed cass asked
bannister grinned widely his deep-
set eyes were weary but the wag of his
head was vigorous and well-satisfied
youre doggone tootin i dont mind
tellin you gentry that my deals all
set to pop therell be guns enough and
to spare when i pass the word to ride
and that word might pass a damn sight
sooner than some are expectin 

  i reckon it might said cass i hear
youre ho man to hem and haw

  no said bannister and he slapped
his hand against the hang of his holster
he was obviously pleased cass gentry
had said exactly the right thing and was
well aware of it

  the valley road was well-traveled
heavily wheel-rutted though there were
no signs of any considerable movement
since the rain they rode half a mile be-
tween slopes that gradually bulged the
brush-choked ridges were knobby with
gray rock and at one place the road made
a fresh bulge to round the slide at the
base of a jag-faced fault there was good
green growth on the valley floor but to
cass the soil looked to run mighty thin

  where these testers mostly from he
asked

  everwhere said bannister theyre
just the usual no-account run ive seen
their setups there beyond the rocker
and ill garantee not onell last next win-
ter they aint built for it

  as the ordinary thing said cass the
homestead folks ive seen run bunch-
like a big family say will fettle rela-
tives in together or else its all swedes
or yankees that set out in a common
crowd

  bannister shook his head not here
they aint these are mongrel-mixed
they got acquainted after theyd moved
in and they clan at the mills for com-
pany this hound-face feller axton set
up a store to handle their trade though
from their looks theres none of em flush
with money

  axton cass frowned he wouldnt
be-no it might be another by the same
name these men bring their families
three-four got their women but
they mainly stood the cold alone youll
see for yourself when we round the spur
there

  they passed the shaggy spur and cass
saw the settlement of burnt mills-the
high-porched store the five rawboned
shacks the jumble of sheds in a bluff-
backed clearing a brook ran in the
rocky bed of what once had been a larger
stream and at the edge of it was a
pasture lot where a few thick-bodied
horses grazed

burnt mills was placid dozing in
quiet not even a yapping dog came
forth to hail the coming riders two men
sat on the store steps but they might
have been wooden figures they watched
the approach with careful disregard with
lazy indifference

  one of them was the speckled buck-
toothed rider who had met wash parsons
yesterday at squawmans knob the
gopher-whiskered jigaroo whose identity
was on the tip of cass gentrys tongue
if he could only speak it a battered
black hat slanted down on one eye-a hat
that sported a rattlesnake band spliced
by a flat stud of silver

  this was the first surprise it raised
considerable questions about the similar
hat cass had shot from a night-raiders

head and the similar hatband now in his
pocket

  the second man had been pithily de-
scribed by abel bannister he had a
hounds baggy eyes and a hounds long-
nosed solemnity cass recognized him
instantly

  he recognized them both as one of the
snaketrack  iders spoke to another sad
ones axton who runs the place the
puncher said other uns named buck
childress

  childress that was the name and it
was also the second surprise it was
even something of a shock to see what a
sharp resemblance this fellow bore to a
dead man tom childress had regular
teeth and an ordinary complexion but it
was plain to see-once you thought of it
-that buck was toms brother

  and tom   

   it was almost two years now since cass
gentry had tracked tom childress down
and killed him

chapter xx

rattler on the bar

a woman appeared in the store en-
trance she struck a pose elbow
propped against the door-jamb and hand
on hip and watched them dismount her
flax-bright hair thickly fluffed trailed
to shoulder-length she was dressed in
sleazy black that smoothed a gloss upon
her bold hip that modeled her thigh that
notched a deep vee below her pale throat

  queenie the knowing puncher mut-
tered and some of the others chuckled
one rider gave a soft expressive whistle

   abel bannister strode toward the steps
hidee axton he hailed youll recall
me i reckon

   why surely said the sad-faced man
how-do mr bannister what can we do
you for today

  ill stand the boys a snort of your
whisky first off bannister said we
just stopped by to let a little bird sing
well walk right in gents said axton
rising cass thought he could detect a
note of relief in the voice and that the
ugliness in the face of buck childress
was suddenly relaxed the woman in the
doorway turned on a red-lipped smile
lifting both hands to push the spill of
her hair as she stepped aside

  come on gentry bannister called
from the top of the steps this is on
me

   cass could see no effect that the pro-
nouncement of his name produced the
lank buck childress had turned his back
to enter with the others and axtons
sidelong glance was expressionless had
they already been informed that he was
dne of the party had cass gentrys ar-
rival been expected here

   well that would come out later there
would be a time for that

   ill first treat my long-headed friend
to a drink cass said slapping the chest-
nuts haunch ill step inside directly
he led the horse toward the brook
ignoring the pump-trough nearby there
were several details he had noted-items
which bred suspicion in him that puddle
which fronted the hitchrack for instance
might have been standing since last
nights rains

  from the looks of the nearby ground
however cass would be willing to bet it
had been formed by water fresh-doused
to wipe out recent hoof-prints that
move of the girl in the door pushing
back her hair had spelled signal if cass
ever saw one

  he was positive that burnt mills had
been geared to handle trouble ths spy-
glass lookout on the upper ridge had

s
been posted for a purpose and doubtless
there were hideout men in nearby cover

  buck childress knowing his hat would
be found on the scene of last nights raid
had adopted the simple defense of band-
ing another hat in identical fashion
sitting on the steps with axton he had
been prepared to face accusation their
surprise at bannisters mild approach had
been obvious

  so much cass knew he could point
out moreover that axton the ill-dressed
backwoods storekeeper had been known
as preacher axton card-sharp and con-
fidence-man in the boom towns west
and that buck childress had been on the
way to building up as snaky a reputation
as his younger brother but would cass
gentrys unsupported word convince
hard-headed abel bannister

  he doubted it

  the chestnut sniffed the brook and
shook his heavy head but cass held him
there while he stored up minor obser-
vations one of these was the sight of a
red-headed man at the window of an
outlying shack a strangers flat-nosed
face that bobbed up briefly another was
the long shed where the horse droppings
were fresh and plentiful there were also
certain indications of travel along the
rubbled bed of the brook that deserved
more thorough investigation

  cass led the chestnut to the rack and
entered the store

tt was more saloon than store along

  one wall were shelves of supplies
piled sacks and stacked boxes but the
main space was bare crudely-nailed
chairs were set around the few rough
tables that fronted the slab-faced bar it
seemed to cass that this bar-counter ran
extra long and that the stock of whiskey
barrels was large for the usual out-coun-
try trade

  there were no other customers the
flaxen-haired woman was behind the bar
rolling her eyes at the punchers she
drew spigot-whisky into a tin cup and
set it out for cass

  drink hearty abel bannister said
this squirrel-juicell raw your throat
but it wont kill you drink er down
boys

  the woman joined them when she put
down her empty cup she glanced at
cass squarely for the first time her 
eyes were hard bold reckless and cass
saw that she had polished off more than
one drink today she was the bright-
haired woman dr farabaugh had men-
tioned jio question of it a man had
risked his life to fight for her had died
for her

   dont you like the taste of pur whisky
mister she asked aint it good
enough huh

   no he said not looking at her its
plenty good for me sister

  he stood beside abel bannister axton
hugged the counter on the other side
of the snaketrack boss handing out a
flow of oily talk buck childress at the
far end of the bar had pointedly ignored
cass since his entry

  bannister pushed his cup aside and
cleared his throat what i stopped for
axton he said was to hand out some
advice yoit can pass it on to the crowd
that uses around here the main thing
is public notice that times has changed
the bull-necked rancher spoke with
harsh emphasis frowning and cass had
to admire his dogged square-fisted way

  us ranchers aint fools bannister
went on we know moren likely axton
that ollie shands got friends among the
nesters theres spies who notify the
pocket crew when cattles been moved
and where and other suchlike

  i dont say these men aint been
planted unbeknownst but i want the
warnin made plain to one and all any
skunk that rides with shand is runnin
his neck into a noose and the rope is
likely to be pulled up short any next
minute

ollie shand was a bug in the ranch-
ers brain cass thought in the face
of absolute proof that buck childress
rode with last nights raiders and that
wash parsons tied in with it too bannis-
ter would probably connect them with
the devils pocket

  and not without reason either as cass
admitted wash parsons could be shands
spy in triangle town childress could be
a cog in the badlands machine for all
cass knew cass had other ideas but
proving them would be a man-sized
order

  a private rewards been posted ban-
nister said for information concernin
the pocket bunch or any side-riders
anybody who knows any facts-what
trails them sons use what hideouts they
got who might be workin with em-
will be paid for same word can be left
at the lig or the pothook ranch well
pay a hunnerd dollars for any piece of
news thats worth it

  ill surely shout that loud preacher
axton said yessir i sure-

  you tell em too bannister rumbled
that this whole valleys section is dan-
gerous country after night startin from
now and lastin till further orders the
roadsll be watched and any man who
travels will need the password your
crowd would be best off to stick at home
come dark if they got to journey let em
light up with a lantern god help em if
they dont

  he slapped the bar thats what the
bird sings axton lets have a last drink
here before we ride

  cass gentrys minutes were running
short if any move was to be made now

was the time to start it there was hidden
danger in this place cass knew but ban-
nister was a fighting man and his hands
drew fighting wages it was time for
dynamite

the woman was serving the snake-
track hands axton was droning a
monolgue to abel bannister and buck
childress stood lonely beyond cass
leaned his hand on the bar staring down
at childress as if he had suddenly recog-
nized some familiarity his words how-
ever were addressed to axton

  big pljice you got here mister mighty
big place to be so out-of-way

  why yes-yes axton grinned crook-
edly ill need the space though when
this country settles and business picks

up

  abel bannister chuckled

  what kind of business you chiefly
do cass asked from the looks of your
store-sheds and dump and what boxes i
can see your biggest stock is barb wire
and ammunition and whisky wheres
your plant seed and granger tools
freight travels slow into here said
axton i stock as needed and theres
other stuff on the way i sell what my
customers want mister it aint for me
to ask how these homesteaders aim to
profit they may expect to live off their
crops or to hold their sections for natural
increase in value

  it was a clever admission preacher
axton was a smooth one and he had
prepared himself with all the answers

  there was talk of that latter yes
said bannister its their legal right if
they choose so some buzzards expected
i suppose that the new rocker owner
might buy em out he grunted ex-
plosively i dont see what youre drivin
at gentry

  i meant said cass that this layout
dont look right to me i dont like the
smell of it nor of some i see around i
got a curiosity to know what trails lead
out of here and where they push and
what travel-tracks theyd show

  how many of these nesters ride saddle
horses i saw fresh sign of quite a bunch
out near that long shed from the looks
of that pasture with its few poor work-
plugs it wouldlook that a string of
twenty-thirty commonly grazed there
how about it axton

  the air had grown tense

  we did have a extra-big night at the
place last night axton said there was
quite a few here is that all youd like to
know mister was there anything else
you found

  yes said cass harshly i found
this explain it to me axton-you or
one of your friends

  he tossed the rattler hatband on the
bar and it wriggled snakelike unfolding

to be continued next week

for fast smooth economical shaves


by r w daly

author of crowd sailj

fitzpatricks right fist traveled in
a short arc chopped against car-
ruthers chin and carruthers
crashed to the ground

  a soldier too long

re heavy blue uniform cloth clung to
his damp body his thin brown lash-
es were unable to hold back the sweat
that welled from the flushed fair skin
beneath the shading brim of his cam-
paign hat and his eyes stung with salty
moisture

 dust churned up from his horses
hooves and blackened his nostrils and
throat he was thirsty his insteps
throbbed where the soles of his boots
curved about the iron stirrups of his
saddle he wished he could ride barefoot

 coppery beeches overhead kept most
of the golden sunlight from blistering
down on him but the leaves also stopped
any breeze from moving the masses of
hot torpid air in the forest

  if the map was correct thered be a
stream ahead and he could soak his feet
and soothe the irritation of bis throat
after the stream there was a plantation

  his wide lean body bobbed easily ef-
fortlessly with the swelling muscles of
the horses broad back beneath his thighs
his relaxed seat in the saddle was a com-
bination of skill and abstraction

 he was wondering why he had ever
joined the cavalry volunteer cavalry at
that resentfully he felt someone should
have warned him

  the infantry now-there was the life
nothing to do but walk around and wait

it happened in the war between
the states but it still holds good
a weeks campaigning can teach
a soldier things about men-in-
cluding himself-that never got
into the manual

for battles the infantry didnt have to
ride far out on the flanks of the army
and scour through the pregnant peace of
a hostile countryside

 he had looked forward to war and now
he had had four years of it the time had
passed too quickly for him to think he
was a man after six months and he still
didnt know how he stood in a mans
world some day when he wasnt harried
by the problems of command hed find
out

 hed spent years reading about hanni-
bal alexander marlborough frederick
napoleon and washington all about
grand tactics he laughed silently bitter-
ly-

 there were lots of things they hadnt
told him at the point grand tactics
they had ignored teaching him how to
keep scouts from falling into ambushes

how to find food when there wasnt any
how to keep a column of men and horses
from soaking to death in a hissing rain

  he had found out those and a million
other bits of knowledge by himself and
the finding had kept him from thinking
about anything else

  he had learned how to maneuver divi-
sions so they had taken him out of school
and given him a squadron which re-
quired that he forget his training as a
potential general in order to cope with
the practical difficulties of his limited
sphere

  he who had understood strategy in
preliminaries and phases was forced to
discard this faculty to sublimate it in
the far more important business of meta-
morphosing scribbled words from the
colonels pen into actuality

  the war to him had to be exactly
where his squadron was from the
theoretical man he had shrunk to the
practical man dimly he perceived that
it was a pity

beside him on his right rode his sen-
ior captain carruthers was an aver-
age man in size intelligence and expe-
rience he wore long drooping mus-
taches

  well major carruthers said heavily
failing to conceal a certain nervousness


which he shared with the extended file
of riders stolidly jogging behind them
i dont see any signs of paget must
have been false information

  he spoke as if he would will his wish
into reality hed feel a lot more com-
fortable if pagets guerrillas werent
lurking in the slumbering georgia woods

  the major looked at him and being
young in years was unable for a moment
to hide his thoughts carruthers flushed
and looked away

  were not concerned with individuals
captain but with the enemy there is
no such thing as information in our case
were finding it not taking it

  after the one little betrayal of con-
tempt in his eyes he had mastered him-
self again he mustnt let carruthers
know how he felt about him bad for dis-
cipline

  the regiment was composed of militia
the major was the only regular army of-
ficer in the outfit the only professional
soldier carruthers was a volunteer
joining as a private he had risen to cap-
tain with a rapidity that indicated either
military skill or politics

  he had been a lawyer in civil life
plunged violently into the boiling hell of
war his civilian nature was encrusted
with a hard ruthless brutality in uni-
form he found a sanction for a lust to
kill

  at antietam he had slain his first man
an elderly alabama colonel whose desire
to wield a heavy saber had been greater
than his physical strength carruthers
remembered the exultant moment when
his blade swinging in a vicious madden-
ed circle chopped aside his adversarys
feebly opposing steel and sank its keen
edge into a pulsing corpulent neck that
gouted a fountain of crimson from its
depths

  and the young trooper who had rushed
up in a vain effort to save his comman-
der only to receive from the vigilant vic-
tor a sudden ripping thrust that bulged
his viscera out upon the saddle

  he had come through that charge un-
scathed and many other charges he
wondered how he had stood his dull life
before the war which had started as a
vacation and imperceptibly became an
end a reason for existing

  and that was where he differed from
the major

  the major persisted in his attempts to
detach his perspective from its depend-
ence upon its immediate viewpoint that
he might see the maneuvers of his army
as directed toward its proper end-the
destruction of the opposing army

  starting from this detachment he went
further and took the war itself in its
character as a necessary evil an evil
which was necessary to preserve the good
that was the federal government of the
states only on that basis could the major
justify his participation in the fratricide

  to him carruthers was bestially im-
moral therefore he maintained a cool
attitude toward the ex-lawyer and his
overtures for the favor of his pointer
superior

he strained his eyes to probe into a
clump of bushes fifty feet ahead he
thought he had seen something move that
shouldnt have been there his fingers
flew to his holstered colts smoothly drew
and fired it in the instant that a spout of
flame blew from the shrubs

  he heard a sharp familiar droning a
man behind him cursed the bushes
threshed and cracked and then were still
far beyond his scouts wheeled and raced
back

  halt he cried raising his hand
sergeant dismount the first troop as



skirmishers his voice was crisp cool

   he watched a line of blue jackets sift
into the woods the rest of the troops
waited in silence carbines cocked he
reloaded the chamber of his revolver
there was a snapping of underbrush as
if somebody was running and a volley of
shots

  he caught a gleam and glanced side-
ways at carruthers leaning tensely for-
ward his saber resting on the pommel of
his saddle

put that away the major said quiet-
ly there isnt room to use it here

  sulkily the captain obeyed drawing
his gun instead

  the commander turned to see if any of
his men had been hurt a trooper had
been shot through the chest mutely giv-
ing his life for the union stupefaction
and agony were in his glazing eyes

  when the major looked forward again
determination had put iron into his jaw
two hundred men pi ced the preserva-
tion of their lives in his hands and he
must do his best

  after a few minutes the skirmishers
came back they had a prisoner a sandy-
haired gaunt defiant youth his clothes
were ragged rotten material torn by
clawing branches a trouser leg was
stained with blood and ripped up to the
hip to accommodate a rough bandage
his face and body were emaciated

  there was another one sir regret-
fully said the sergeant a burly sweat-
ing man but he got away

   the major returned the sergeants sal-
ute and looked down into the bright
steady brown eyes of the captive

  your regiment

  no answer

  the majors lips compresed the
youngster wasnt wearing anything that
resembled a uniform not even a belt
with c s a on its buckle hed have
to reply to the questions

  youre a confederate soldier

   the prisoners head inclined slightly
proudly acknowledging his allegiance he
was distracted openly studying the situ-
ation in which chance and a good shot
had placed him

   then tell me the name of your corps
the major said patiently he was tighten-
ing inside an obscure closet of military
law opened in a corner of his mind and
tumbled ugly phrases about franctireurs
and the punishment dealt them into the
consciousness of his mind

   he tried to quiet the voice of tradition
by observing to himself that the fellow
was obviously a soldier and not a civil-
ian but the voice had an answer to every
objection triumphantly reminding him
that if the man was a soldier and out of
uniform he was a spy

   still unaccountably unreasonably he
rebelled against the obvious he did not
wish to take the spark from the darting
eyes before him he did not desire to be
a mere tool of antiquated usage why
this man was just about his own age

   are you attached to pagets brigade
he asked

  the young fellow smiled sorry ma-
jor he replied his voice was soft and
slurred the words

  thats enough blurted carruthers
hoarsely hang him

  the major whimsically confused car-
ruthers with the voice of doom he ges-
tured to a sergeant to approach and take
the prisoner who at that movement
wrested himself free from the grasp of
his captors and twisted to run into the
woods

   a pistol cracked a round hole punched
into the back of his shirt he faltered
spinning halfway around

surprise anger accusation moved his

 features for a second until his legs puttily
 sagged and slid him forward onto the
 ground

   a half smile distorted carruthers lips
almost got away he said cheerfully
holstering his smoking revolver

hthe major stared at him the stare
- was much the same as that given by
the confederate with the addition of
authority

  why did you kill him

  he was escaping carruthers replied
easily his manner was pained and in-
jured he had acted as he saw fit accord-
ing to his lights and cultivated brutality
a superior place in the engine of disci-
pline a position where he dictated the
acts of other men had not imbued him
with a sense of his own submission

  the men veterans were shocked by
the needless slaying the wounded pris-
oner could have as easily been shot in
the other leg as in the back

  angry as they were with the reb for
the death of one of their own number
they had a certain sympathy for them
to them the ultimate unit in the game
rebs were men like themselves and had
the same interest in trying to outlast the
war

  we wont discuss it now said the
major checking his passion in time to
remember that an officer must not be
publicly reprimanded hed discuss it
later-at a court martial hed break
carruthers

   he looked down at the motionless body
he saw a youngster who should have
been devoting his thoughts to the culti-
vation of enough whiskers to attack with
a razor instead of skulking in an ambush
to snipe at invaders invaders because
the major knew that his army was on
the aggressive even if the aggression
was justifiable

  the prisoner had been defending his
native soil there was nothing cowardly
about that

  forward he shouted

  the column once again jogged along
the worn pathway carruthers fell back
beside the trumpeter he was mystified
by the grimness in the faces of the men
at whom he chanced to look they were
reflective hating resentful

   it was all right he muttered savagely
to himself but the stem profile of the
major gave him cause to doubt that it
was all right

  he began to think one man had gotten
away from the skirmishers maybe he
had witnessed the shooting of his com-
panion maybe even now he had crawled
into another ambush from which he
might avenge his comrade

   a little gimlet of fear bored into the
bravado of captain carruthers his
cheeks turned pasty beneath his rich
limp black mustaches his smouldering
eyes narrowed any bush might hide a
rifle and a resolution of revenge

   he began to feel conspicuous the wide
red sword sash about his waist was an
excellent target he wasnt a small man
a careful marksman would hardly miss
a marksman who had lived in these
woods couldnt miss

   a sweat of fear mixed with that of heat
and bathed his body in its soggy serge
he shuddered as with a chill he longed
to get down off his horse and walk among
the trees protected by their trunks

  only the mocking eyes of the major
kept him from ramming spurs into the
belly of his charger to plunge along the
path until he broke into the safety of a
clearing where he could see what was
about him he was shrinkingly aware of
the power of a bullet against which the
heavy rolling muscles of his torso were
defenseless his whole body tightened

  despite his strength his saber his
colts he was at the mercy of an ounce
of lead and a few grains of powder

   it wasnt right

after an hour of torture the squad-
ron reached a stream and by then
carruthers was ready to collapse

  the major ordered a brief rest taking
off his boots to keep his promise to him-
self he sat on a rock studying his map
and dangled his feet in cooling purling
water the other officers took the time
to snatch something to eat

  carruthers splashed into the brook he
stood in front of his preoccupied com-
mander waiting for some any comment
they werent out of the woods yet he
had the impression a crawling of the skin
that the squadron was carefully watched

  the major didnt speak so he took the
initiative

  we must be close to the plantation
he remarked he hoped they were or-
ders were for him to take half of the
command and proceed on a tangent back
to the army hed feel much safer near
the infantry and their alert pickets

  the major didnt glance up at once
his feet were becoming comfortable but
he had a mind which couldnt enjoy the
present spending the present in contem-
plating the future or regretting the past

  he anticipated things he had been
watching for the brook that he might
soothe his aching feet and they had come
to the brook now he had to fasten his
mind on another distant object

  he didnt want to he sensed vaguely
that the future was full of men like car-
ruthers who took advantage of their
chances to be inhuman the future was
charged with blood and suffering

  he had heard indeed could see that
the generals march to the sea would split
the confederacy already split in the
west into two allowing each half to be
doubled on and beaten in turn the war
would be so much closer to the end those
grand men lee and johnson couldnt
hold on much longer it was impossible

  but he reflected it had also been im-
possible two autumns ago the war was
still going on these men overcame diffi-
culties impossibilities

  he was very very tired maybe some
day this would be over

  at the end of this raid captain you
may consider yourself under arrest

  he had killed one of our men

  he was a prisoner

  carruthers sneered as openly as he
dared youre squeamish sir

  he was a prisoner the major repeat-
ed coldly

  carruthers went back to his horse

  refreshed the squadron remounted and
jingled along their way

  the woods began to thin a scout came
back to report that a deserted group of
buildings was immediately ahead the
major received the news quietly de-
taching a troop as an advance guard
they could not find a trace of the enemy

they came to the edge of the woods
five hundred yards away a large
rambling u-shaped house sprawled on
top of a slope the style was old colonial
with a long portico

  it had once been magnificent but now
retained only the gentility of its designer
and inhabitants storm and wind and
rain had worked upon its boards and
paint aging virgin white into weather-
beaten gray

  it was silent windows closed and
masked with lace

  the patrolling squadron waited while
their lieutenant walked boldly up the

steps to the door and banged the knocker
they watched the door open saw the
lieutenant bow hesitantly and then dis-
appear into the yawning hallway  

  what the devil muttered the major
eyes narrowing

  the door opened again a figure in blue
appeared and becked to the squadron that
it was all right to proceed remaining in
the doorway a glass in his hand

  the major  was suspicious carruth-
ers he said take over now but wait
until ive reached that porch before you
head south toward the army

  whats wrong

  that officer should rejoin his troop
the major explained even if he does like
mint juleps

  seventy men clattered out of the woods
after him cursing the intensified heat of
the sun in the clearing the air shim-
mered he loosed his saber in its scab-
bard and automatically swung his belt
so that his pistol was ready to hand

  the mansion was too quiet too inno-
cent to be quiet and innocent it was
excellently situated to be a fortress a
trap with long unobstructed ranges on
all sides

  with a wave of the hand he ordered
his men to remain in their extended
double column rather than close up into
fours

  -they came up to the idling advance
troop a hundred feet from the house
when it happened

the blue figure in the doorway threw
away the glass and shrilled the rebel
yell instantly rifles poked from every
shutter the side of the house was filmed
in white smoke

  yankee troopers tumbled fatly from
their saddles a branding iron scorched
the majors left shoulder his arm dan-
gled uselessly

  having anticipated treachery he was
prepared to meet it there was only one
thing to do theyd have to go through
hell to get thjg close again nor could
he withdraw and subdue the house from
a distance it would take too much time

  draw arms he roared to his stricken
cavalrymen charge

  his horse bounded across the short dis-
tance to the porch pulling up sharply
at the breast-high planking the major
stood in the stirrups and jumped over the
balustrade losing his balance and meas-
uring his full length upon the pine
planks just as a second volley ripped from
the windows

  he stumbled to his feet and dashed at
a round eye of steel it erupted at his
waist but he was able to deflect the bar-
rel with a sweep of his saber and the
bullet shrieked past him

  then he was safe flattened against the
peeling wall hard by a window feebly
gripping his gun in his left hand he broke
the glass panes with his sword and
hacked at the wooden framework

  his men came up

  heavy colts revolvers drove the de-
fenders from the windows sabers made
short work of flimsy glass and wood

  the major mechanically shot a man
lunging at him with a bayonet as he
legged over a windowsill he wondered
at the simplicity of taking life

  a squeeze on a trigger a slight kick in
the palm of a hand and all that had gone
to make a man-life family friends re-
ligion education-all vanished in the ac-
rid tang of burnt gunpowder leaving
behind a graceless bulk devoid of all po-
tentialities save that of decomposition

  tonight trying to sleep hed see that
spurt of flame and answering spurt of
blood

  he stepped quickly over the sill into

the interior of the house parrying a
thrust with his sword he coolly knocked
his assistant unconscious with a sharp
blow on the head from his pistol

 his shoulder throbbed he looked
around the room well furnished was
brightened by oblique rays of sun light

  a handful of shadowy figures fero-
sciously flung themselves upon the at-
tackers but the blue jackets poured into
the house in overwhelming numbers as
carruthers brought his demi-squadron
into action

  theyre too many boys gasped a
voice were licked

  the fight was over as quickly as it had
begun a dozen or so confederates sul-
lenly dropped their weapons and suffered
themselves to be huddled into a group

  the major looked at his prisoners the
bodies on the carpet he started to speak
his heart stabbed convulsively blackness
stealthily flowed through his brain and
he quietly toppled onto his face

he fought his way back out of a
buzzing void he opened his eyes
he was on his back staring up into a
blue cloudy sky he forced himself to
sit up the movement almost sending him
back into the hazy reaches his shoulder
was crudely bandaged his tunic gone
and his shirt ruined

  whats going on he demanded
hoarsely seeing men working over a fire

  captain carruthers ordered the house
burned sir explained his sergeant

  the major got to his feet how many
did we lose he asked softly his ser-
geant told him it wasnt so bad consid-
ering then he walked toward the pris-
oners

  what the devil he exclaimed and
turned to his sergeant a woman was in
the group was she-

  yes sir right in the middle of
things

  was she harmed

  the sergeant grinned shes just mad
sir

  ignoring the men he went over to the
woman she was elderly perhaps sixty

  im major fitzpatrick he said polite-
ly eleventh ohio cavalry

  she frigidly acknowledged the self-in-
troduction by raising her eyebrows there
was a barrier between them that she
wouldnt cross not even at the expense
of courtesy

he tried again mrs stevenson
yes she spoke as though this bar-
barous yankee would torture answers
from her if she refused to give them
im sorry maam

  must you burn my house she asked
suddenly after a moment of speculation
and compromise she didnt have to say
that it was all that remained to her he
could judge that from the poverty of
flesh and color in her cheeks he was
somehow proud of her pride and calm-
ness

  carruthers coming up overheard the
question you harbored rebels he said
roughly take the consequences
fitzpatrick bit his lip many many
troubles of the past few years stretched
taut and broke under a surge of emotion

  he looked back over his experience
seeing dead men everywhere men strick-
en on battlefields cut down in little out-
of-the-way skirmishes hung as spies
men who had been americans killing
each other because they disagreed in
political and social ideas

  but they killed according to rules
people fired from houses well then the
houses were burned

  damn you carruthers he said dis-
passionately get your men and clear out
of here he was amazed that he did not


smash his fist into that righteous face

  mrs stevenson was surprised but
stoically awaited the outcome

  carruthers smiled he suspected that
he had stumbled upon an advantage and
purposed to follow it to the hilt the
house must be burned he said thats
law

  as beseechingly as her principles per-
mitted mrs stevenson stared at the
young officer who was befriending her
then was no longer a barrier she trust-
ed him that angry look in his blue eyes
made him worthy of trust

  she had sons sons with hood and hill
she understood men so she perceived
that this tenseness wasnt a personal an-
tagonism the yankee major was too fine
for pettiness it went deeper than social
dislike

  she was right

  carruthers was revealed to fitzpatrick
as the personification of the system that
legalized terror and cruelty a system
with rules iron rules that couldnt yield
to humanity because humanity was a
national prerogative-nationality an ac-
cident of birth was an accident important
enough to make a science and profession
of killing

  and he was practicing that profession

  fitzpatricks thoughts were far away
from a magnificent aged mansion and a
magnificent aged lady yet curiously he
was aware of what carruthers had said
the habits of years made him reply as a
commander preserving his authority

  i know the law captain your men
are waiting

facing court martial carruthers
sought any opportunity to discredit
his superior he sensed the majors per-
turbation and determined to force the
issue

  youre wounded sir he said with
elaborate courtesy if you dont mind
ill stay and-

  i do mind fitzpatrick interposed
go to your command

  the men close by yanks and rebs
alike gravely witnessed the dispute they
werent often spectators at an officers
quarrel

  carruthers didnt move

  im ordering you to go fitzpatrick
said evenly take the prisoners and
wounded

  my duty is here carruthers retorted
the house must be burned

  youre giving me no alternative mr
carruthers place yourself under captain
hardys orders youre relieved from
duty

  what

  fitzpatrick ignored him addressing his
sergeant my compliments to captain
hardy he said please direct him that
i desire him to accept captain carruthers
responsibility

  outraged carruthers leaped forward
clawing for his colts his jaw was slack
his lips writhed with furious gibberish
his gun cam into his hand he meant
to kill

  fitzpatrick measured the distance his
right fist traveled in a short arc chopped
against a stubbly chin he put the re-
pression of years into the blow wincing

with pain as his wounded shoulder pro-
tested the strain

  carruthers stopped in his tracks a
smile flickered on his puzzled relaxed
face he slowly crashed to the ground

  fitzpatrick was strangely serene he
looked at his sergeant who was semi-
delirious with approval revive him
he said he exulted with the exultation
of a galley slave when the chains are
riven from his ankles carruthers had
been a symbol and he had crushed the
symbol

  then his satisfaction curdled captain
hardy a trim efficient officer came to
him and saluted

  im pleased to comply with your re-
quest sir he said formally happy that
he had been distinguished by a superior
whom he admired any further orders

fitzpatrick felt a contraction of his
soul he knew now how he stood
in the world he couldnt escape the
acts of years bound him the pride of his
family shackled him he was left in the
midst of it complete with all the trap-
pings

  he was an officer and received the
deference due his rank he was looked
up to as an authority a cog who rotated
smaller cogs in their spheres they
wouldnt fail him he couldnt fail them

  take the prisoners he said quietly
and leave immediately

  the lady sir

  no mr hardy she remains

  feeling rebuffed hardy stiffened sa-
luted and as quickly as possible took his
troops away toward the southeast an
officer holding the dazed carruthers seat-
ed upright

  fitzpatrick watched them go a poig-
nant bitter canker gnawing at his spirit
he couldnt be free he had been a sol-
dier too long he had too many times in
the course of duty caused death true
he had been impersonal about it but sud-
denly he saw that this detached manner
was as horrible as the impassioned fury
of carruthers both achieved the same
end both destroyed

  the horsemen disappeared into the
woods

  mrs stevenson passively waited for
him to speak in her eyes he saw that she
knew much of what had been in his mind
she smiled to give him strength and
courage in his resolution if he had re-
solved to break

  i cant he said gently shaking his
head im in too deep but i wont burn
your house to hell with the colonel
it was the least he could do

  thank you she replied graciously
im sorry he caught her meaning
wont you let me take care of your
shoulder

  he hesitated to accept her invitation
loitering in enemy territory was danger-
ous still the men could use a rest and
his shoulder did hurt he called to his
remaining captain who ran over to him

  dont unsaddle he directed stand
to ready to leave this is rather exposed
in case anything happens gallop to the
woods

  and you sir asked the captain

  dont wait for me im a fool to take

a risk like this therefore ill take the
consequences alone if there are any

  he spoke convincingly but didnt mean
it he wasnt a fool for having been kind
remembering this lady would give him
something to continue on

  he followed her into the mansion past
the hallway where his lieutenant had
been knocked unconscious while a reb
took his place through the living rooms
where they had fought back to a quiet
sitting room where she made him wait
while she got some cloth and water

  alone he began to think again

  he was idly brooding over the view of
the ravished barren fields when she re-
turned how does it look in the spring
he asked absently

  she smiled and set to work on his
shoulder

they didnt speak because they didnt
have to he was at peace not with
himself but with the world he could
never be at peace with himself he had
done too much

  but he felt clean as clean as the cot-
ton with which she swabbed his purpling
wound the army had him but there was
now a part of him which it could never
have it was his to keep until he could
have the freedom to nurse it into vitality
into a force which could carry him to the
end

  it had almost been extinguished but it
was still there or he would have been
incapable of appreciating the charm of
these few moments

  when she was done she threw away
his shirt and helped him into a fresh
whole one he knew without asking that
it belonged to a son of hers gingerly
he put it on she held out his bloody
tunic

  he smiled suddenly

  after its over he said may i come
back

 she nodded pulled downhis head and
kissed his forehead

  he gently disengaged himself and went
back through the empty house

  suddenly he heard firing and in the
instant realized what had happened that
ambusher who had escaped- he had
reached paget and now the demi-squad-
ron was surrounded

  he ran to the open door grateful to
see his men faithful to orders bolting for
cover under a whistling hail of minie
balls he reached the porch he could
see the rifles fringing the woods

  he looked for his horse it was held by
his sergeant he raced to its side as he
bung himself up into the saddle he saw
a group of men run from the under-
brush

  ride he shouted to his stubborn en-
listed man who waited for him to get
started

  one of the men dropped to his knees
he could see the muzzle bear down on
him

  strangely fitzpatrick didnt care not
ever when the slug tore through his silk
sword-sash and snuffed out his animal
life hurling him beneath his cursing ser-
geants horse

  he was content he had all eternity to
be himself

farewell
to the

by borden chase

flanagan wasted no time
he lifted the german high
above his head and tossed
him over the rail

chapter xxv

love should wear armor

mark nodded and went to his
cabin it seemed his head had
scarcely touched the pillow be-
fore olsens hand was on his shoulder

the cook had made coffee and mark
dressed quickly he went to the cabin
and sipped a cup of the steaming liquid
a moment later he heard a step and
turned to find connie coming toward the
table

her hair was tousled and her eyes not
quite open and when olsen brought the
coffee she yawned mark thought she
looked like a youngster wakened an
hour too early from sleep

 momin she said hows the big
deep-sea diver today

couldnt be better said mark but
what brings you out of your bunk so
early

oh i just couldnt sleep

go on youre half asleep now
am not said connie she rubbed
her eyes and if you insist that i am
then youre no gentleman

mark laughed could it be youve de-
cided to stand a watch with me

does it look as if i intend to do some
moonlight swimming

that might be the answer

oh shush up said connie its too

early to be clever and i dont like to
sound stupid finish your coffee and lets
relieve red tanyas with him and hes
probably bored to tears

  mark grinned at her and said with
considerable emphasis

  yeah-i can just imagine

  mark put down his cup and followed
connie to the deck the schooner had
swung wide on her chain and tanya and
red were leaning against the after rail
looking toward the island flanagan
turned quickly at the sound of connies
footsteps

  ahoy the watch he called faith
twas but a moment past that you left
for your bunk connie time flies in
the indies so it does

  it was four hours ago said connie
pertly

  was it now laughed red he took
tanyas arm and headed toward the
cabin in that case tis time i had me
coffee and caught up with a bit of sleep
keep a sharp eye on the island mates
and ill see you the moment its light
connie made a snoot at him and seated
herself on the forward hatch mark
walked the deck for a time glancing oc-
casionally toward the island the quar-
ter moon had reached the zenith and
was dipping toward its home in the sea
as it went it built a silver path across
the caribbean to the battered bow of the
wanderer

connie sat with her knees hunched up
her chin on her hands and her eyes
on the moonstreak as mark passed her
she yawned he circled the schooner and
passed again and again connie yawned

having trouble keeping awake he
asked

yes

then why not go below

im on watch stupid

mark grinned dont you trust me
yes and thats just the trouble
said connie she glanced up at the stars
a schooner in the tropics a moon in the
sky a soft wind blowing across the ca-
ribbean-and i get stuck with a man any
girl could trust

mark walked to the hatch and sat
down he put an arm about her shoul-
ders is this any better

a little but not much say something
nice

mark shook his head ive tried a
dozen times it sounds good when i say
it to myself but when i try to say it to
you-well it seems stupid

what for instance 

oh everything connie ive just-
well ive never had the opportunity to
talk with a girl like you

thats better said connie now tell
me why youve never made love to a
girl like me

too busy i suppose it isnt so many
years ago when i was working for fifteen

the first- installment of this six-part serial herein concluded appeared
in the argosy for february 


a week as a clerk since then iye gone
a long way but it took every moment
of my time to get there

  to get where

   i run dufresne industries at least i
 did until i made this trip

  so what

  well i thought that was something
 connie put both hands on his cheeks
 held his face firmly and kissed him
 squarely on the lips it was a long kiss
 and connie did a thorough job of it
 when she was finished she drew a deep
 breath folded her hands demurely in her
 lap and looked at mark

  now what do you think she asked
 you and your stupid dufresne indus-
 tries

  mark looked at the stars ah me
 he said to think of the time ive
 wasted

   connies laugh was a silver thing oh
 mark you sound like red flanagan
 do i

   exactly

 then perhaps theres some hope for
 me connie if i stay close to red for
 another few weeks i may learn the way
 to tell you the things ive had in my mind
 since the day we met

  what things

  that your voice plays in my ears
 and keeps me awake when i should be
 sleeping its a sweet voice connie
 sweeter than any tropic breeze that
 blows across the caribbean

  his arm went about her slim waist
 and drew her toward him connie tilted
 her head and her eyes were bright as
 she rested her cheek against his

 for a moment mark held her in si-
 lence and then ive often looked at
 the tips of your ears and envied their
 closeness to your cheeks and your hair
 -soft as the strands of a gossamer web
 caught in the rays of the setting sun
 beautiful hair connie-

   he stopped and turned his head slight-
 ly connie waited waves rippled against
 the hull of the silent wanderer still
 connie waited a night bird called con-
 nie turned her cheek to touch marks
 my hair- she said go on mark
 i-

  yes

  i thought i heard a sound like an
 oar hitting the water

  connies lips grew a pout you were
 talking about my hair

  but i heard a sound connie

   my heart silly its knocking against
 my ribs

  mark grinned this was a splash
 then it was a flying fish said connie
 impatiently she lifted her lips lets
 not talk

  connie was lovely and mark was hu-
 man-even as you and i he drew her
 close and his lips met hers while the rest
 of the world went spinning by in a mad
 procession of night and sea and stars that
 had lost their way in the heavens

  a moment passed perhaps a score
 time was a foolish thing

  then mark heard a laugh that was
 almost a grunt he dropped his arms
 and he whirled about to find a man with
 a gun in his hand

  so sorry said the man you will
 say noding-both of you

  he was a tall man blond and heavy-
 set with a heidelberg scar across his
 cheek and a smile that stamped him a
 cynic he wore an officers cap with an
 anchor emblem a high-necked blue
 sweater and dark trousers

  the hand that held the gun was large
 and mark noticed it didnt tremble

  over the stern came additional men

 

 silent creatures out of the night they
 jumped to the deck like hurrying shad-
 ows and came toward their leader

   mark drew a long breath his stomach
 felt as if it had been on ice for a week
 the gun was very close then he braced
 his legs and doubled one fist and his
 voice was filled with rage

   like hell you will he cried he tried
 a looping right run connie call red
 -the crew

   achi dummkopf said the officer

  he lifted his gun and brought the
 barrel down on marks forehead

chapter xxvi

morning captain

 onnies voice came from far away
 saying the same thing over and over
 mark tried to catch the words but his
 head hurt his back hurt everything
 hurt

  the voice was closer now mark
 dear are you hurt badly mark-

   he opened his eyes and blinked then
 he closed them again the world was on
 fire it must be he could see the red
 blaze even through his tightly closed lids

   but that was stupid water doesnt
 burn and he was on the wanderer he
 tried again this time the red flame had
 rounded to the shape of a monstrous ball

   the sun it flared across the water and
 painted the surface an angry crimson

   mark was angry too at the moment
 he wasnt quite sure why he was angry
 his head was raging he tried to lift
 one hand to it the hand wouldnt move
 he tried the other they were tied be-
 hind his back and he was stretched at
 full length on a hatch

   he heard connies voice again then
 he remembered that officer with the
 gun-the men climbing aboard the wan-
 derer

  oh hell said mark wearily he
 turned his head and looked at connie
 what a mess ive made

   sudden relief came intoher eyes she
 too was resting on one shoulder hands
 fastened behind her back beyond was
 red flanagan seated on the edge of the
 hatch his hands were lashed securely
 and so were those of the crew

   mark looked toward the island the
 wanderer had been moved into the
 mouth of the small bay and in the dis-
 tance mark could hear the sound of
 pneumatic drills biting into rock a dust
 cloud grew from the side of the cliff and
 at times there came the rumble of a
 blasting

  competent men these germans it
 hadnt taken them long to put their ma-
 chinery to work marks teeth clamped
 firmly on his lower lip as he shook his
 head 

   are you all right dear asked con-
 nie

   yes said mark dully i see the
 heinies moved in and made a fool of
 me a fine thing i ought to have my
 head examined

   captain schmidt says theres a doctor
 on the island hell put stitches in it for
 you

   i dont mean that

 mark scowled and even that was pain-
 ful he winced

   well i do

 mark grunted is he the guy that
 slugged me

who

 captain schmidt

 yes

 louse said mark he turned his
 head and looked at flanagan well
 what do you think of your mate now

 red dropped a slow lid it could
 happen to any man mark-though

 i	doubt many would have the courage to
 jump a gun you owe captain schmidt
 a debt for not pulling the trigger

  i owe him a debt all right said
 mark he nodded toward the cabin is
 hugo still in his bunk

  theyve not harmed him said flan-
 agan hell be on deck later

  why

   to go ashore with the rest of us
   prisoners 

  red bobbed his head so it seems
 mate i dont savvy the vile language
 well enough to get the whole of it but
 tanya sold them a bill of goods with
 that most persuasive voice of hers
 tanya eh said mark where is
 she now

  having breakfast with captain
schmidt no doubt

  connie wriggled across the hatch and
 put her cheek next to marks your face
 is flushed and youll work up a fever
 just lie quietly and-

  connie please said mark theres
 a time and place for everything this is
 neither

   is that so said connie quickly and
 her eyes went round if i had one hand
 free mark hallam id-

  red flanagans laugh chased a gull
 from the rail look out for these red-
 heads mate theyre dangerous ladies
 both

   mark tried for a smile you say tanya
 and the captain are at breakfast

   most likely

  what happens after that

  oh well be dumped ashore and
 tanya will sail back to see how the
 sphinx is getting along she left velas-
 quez and his men under guard while
 her engineroom crew tried to patch up
 the bearings if they can be repaired
 quickly the sphinx will go on about her
 business if not me lady will look for
 another yacht

  and what of velasquez and his
men

  if theyre lucky said red quietly
 theyll join us as prisoners on the island
 if not theyll walk the floor of the carib-
 bean without the aid of a divers rig
 these people mean business mark

 hthere was silence for a time mark
 - tugged at his bonds once then gave
 it up as useless he recalled some of the
 clever escapes he had seen in the movies

  there was that business of using your
 teeth to unfasten your partners lash-
 ings not a bad idea except for the fact
 that marks teeth would probably come
 loose before the knots in the lines did

  and then there was the square-faced
 heinie with the gun who passed slowly
 along the deck hed have something to
 say about any teeth tricks

  a sharp piece of metal-that was an-
 other gag but there wasnt any sharp
 piece of metal around and mark
 couldnt get to the matches in his pocket
 to burn through the ropes besides he
 had never been a boy scout

  mark eased onto his back and gave the
 whole thing up as a bad job

   could i borrow one of your shoulders
 connie he asked at length if we sit
 back and sort of lean against each other
 we might- be a little more comfortable
 youre a snob said connie youre
 only nice when you want something
 youd get as much benefit out of the
 arrangement as i

   oh a business deal eh

   call it that if you like

   i dont like said connie she wrig-
 gled her legs and pulled her shoulders
 from the hatch i dont need any part-
 ner

 you will when your back starts to
ache -

  oh all right mr dufresne industries
sit up and put your shoulders against
mine im just dying to hear all about
the excess profit tax-or something
mark grinned and wished he hadnt
each time he moved his face pain leaped
through his head he got his shoulders
against connies and for a time they sat
quietly

  silence grew monotonous mark turned
his head and said hello you

  sssh said connie im thinking
  about what

 tanya padilla wouldnt it be won-
derful if she tried to make breakfast for
captain schmidt and used lye for the
biscuits instead of flour

 you can think of the damnedest
things

  well its a pleasant thought any-
way

 mark shook his head wearily and as
he did there came a shout from the bow
the square-faced man with the rifle ran
forward others followed him there was
a moment of quick conversation and a
seaman ran to the cabin

captain schmidt came on deck and
tanya followed she was carrying
glasses the officer took them from her
and leveled them along the sun streak
drei schijfe he said curtly
dampjschiffe asked tanya

  nein schooners

  red flanagan was sitting erect as he
looked under the sun toward the horizon
mark leaned forward hunched his knees
and bumped across the hatch to reds
side

 what does he say

 three ships coming our way an-
swered red and he chuckled the cap-
tain says theyre schooners and faith
im sure hes right

  schooners cried mgrk

  aye velasquez has given the sphinx
the slip and now hes come for his
wanderer and hes not come alone by
the looks of things hes brought peder-
son griffith and burke along for com-
pany

chapter xxvii

the swede is a sailok

the mornings red sun had promised
wind and now it started to blow
hardly a gale but a spanking breeze that
feathered the tops of the hurrying waves
that raced past the mouth of the bay

 mark squinted his eyes and looked
into the sun beneath the rim of the
fiery ball he saw three silhouettes min-
iature ships with their tiny masts
weighted down by a spread of canvas

  red called them by name the dancer
the gull and the leprechaun and his
laugh was a shout as he turned his head
to look at tanya padilla

 the top o the morning to you me
lady he said i see youve got com-
pany coming

  theyre fools said tanya and so
are you if you think they can take this
schooner

  i wouldnt gamble on that said red
ive seen velasquez angry before and
faith the man is no angel if youll take
my tip for what its worth youll not be
here when he comes acalling

 tanya came to the edge of the hatch
and looked down at red her eyes were
worried have you forgotten the three-
inch gun on the island

 it had slipped me mind said red

quickly ah me youve the devils
own luck tanya darling the setup is
perfect made to order for the likes of
your friends theyll enjoy this shelling
three ships that cant shell back it
should be almost as much sport as bomb-
ing youngsters at school

  thank you said tanya she seated
herself beside him

  oh youre welcome said flanagan
and dont be distressed tis the fortune
of war and luck as well the men who
sail the caribbean are used to such
things and theyll laugh as they die

  i dont want them to die red
  dont you now

  no

then why not stop the slaughter
tanya shrugged you should know
better than to ask that she pointed to
captain schmidt who was giving orders
to his men

  he has a country too a few dozen
sailors more or less wont stand in the
way of his duty still if you can think
of any way-

red looked at mark and his eyes
asked the question mark twisted his
mind for the answer a dozen came but
none was good

  no use to ask tanya to set them free
evenif she could mark hallam and red
flanagan would stand little chance
against the men who had taken the
wanderer

  these men had guns and knew how to
use them they werent in a mood for
nonsense

  mark shook his head he looked aft
and saw a pulling boat heading toward
the shore captain schmidt had sent his
orders

  looks as if its all over but the shoot-
ing said mark at length

  it does that said red slowly and
now i know how judas felt those men
are trying to help me

  his wide shoulders drooped and he
hunched them forward as he looked
toward the sea the schooners were
growing as the minutes passed coming
close and always closer

  mark shut his eyes and turned away
but he couldnt shut his mind he looked
at thft island and saw men on the cliff
the drills had stopped and the bay was
silent except for the song of the wind
in the stays and the sibilant wash of the
waves

  captain schmidt had gone forward to
watch the sea he stood near the rail
with his glasses leveled and waited with
stolid patience

  the schooners tacked and went off on
a reach then came about in a slanting
line like three ancient men owar with
all sails set and sheets close hauled each
carried a bone between her teeth as she
raced across the wind

  how long will it be asked mark
they must be well within range of that
gun

  they are said red but the men at
the gun are taking no chances those
schooners are fast in a wind such as this
the gunners will wait till they reach the
bay no chance of a miss and plenty of
time to finish all three before they could
get away

  connie had bumped across the hatch
and taken a place- at marks shoulder
now she closed one eye and opened it
wide then looked at both men wisely
she turned her head no more than a
trifle and rolled her eyes toward the
shrouds

  mark looked quickly red took his
time both saw that tanya had left the
hatch and was standing close to a signal

halyard she seemed to be pondering

  now what on earth is me lady to do
whispered red

  nothing good ill bet said connie
tanya crossed the deck she seated
herself beside red and reached up to
unknot the blue scarf that was wound
about her hair she spread it across her
knees and dipped into reds hip pocket

  he looked at tanya sharply as she took
out his white handkerchief casually tore
it in two strips and placed them diag-
onally across the blue scarf

  got any pins connie she asked
act your age where would i have
pins

tanya turned to red have you
he glanced at the lapel of the linen
jacket it seems velasquez has the sail-
ors habit theres some driven down
through the top seam

  thanks said tanya and helped her-
self

  now what asked red

tanya waited until she had pinned
the white strips to the blue scarf
diagonal white stripes on a blue back-
ground-isnt that the flag signal for
danger ahead

   tis the other way about but thats
like a woman said red he chuckled as
he looked at the improvised flag and
what would you be up to with that

  if i can get it aloft velasquez may see
it and put about

  a long chance but worth the try
said red have you thought what the
good captain schmidt will do to you
when he finds you playing both sides
me dangerous lady

  tanya smiled i have a fairly good
idea

  she stood up and as she did the
harsh crack of a three-inch gun sounded
from the island a puff of smoke drifted
up from the cliff a shell broke the water
just over the bow of the leading
schooner

  too late said red and now the
dance begins

  very slowly tanya tore the white
strips and dropped them onto the deck
she sat next to red and rewound the
bright scarf about her hair knotting it
firmly over one ear then she rested her
chin upon her hands and watched the
schooners	

  the gun spoke again and this shot
went home it splintered a mast on the
flying gull and brought her canvas
down a third hit her hull just off the
bow and let the water in

  tis murder cried red but look
at the dancer-and look at the lepre-
chaun theyve not changed course
theyre driving ahead driving straight
for the mouth of the bay

  are they mad yelled mark dont
they want to live

  i doubt if they care about that said
red his eyes were bright and his lips
were back from two rows of even teeth

  theyre coming in theyre trying to
close ah mate look yonder at men of
the sea and be glad youre one of the
breed

  he struggled erect and opened his
mouth the cords were like ropes on
each side of his throat and he strained at
the lashings that held him

  pederson burke tis flanagan here
make for the schooner you sons of the
devil and well have a waltz with the
huns

his voice roared out across the waves
to challenge the sound of the distant
gun that was firing from the cliff the
leprechaun staggered as a shell hit


her square and tore away the wheel

a scarecrow figure was hurled aloft
and flanagan groaned in his chest

   ill pay them burke i swear i will
he cried as he strained his arms then
he swung about and his flaring eyes
looked straight at tanya padilla get
me a knife you woman from hell or ill
wait for you beyond the grave and twist
your lovely throat

  and have you killed said tanya
softly she pointed forward toward the
rail where captain schmidt was stand-
ing hed put a bullet through your
head before you had taken three steps
the gull was sinking by the bow and
the leprechaun had walked into irons
another shell brought her foremast
down the next split the bow of the
crippled ship and her stern commenced
to lift

   but the dancer drove on to the mouth
of the bay heeling hard over from the
thrust of the wind a tow-headed man
was at the wheel and his legs were
spread on the slanting deck he lifted a
hand with a club-like fist and shook it
once at the gun on the cliff

   a shell was the answer it holed the
jib a second tore splinters from the
deck but the next shot missed the
dancer completely

  the schooner rushed on forward
stood a tall dark man with a line coiled
over his arm there was a noose in the
end and he lifted it high then silent as
death and equally sure he waited there
at the dancers rail with his eyes upon
the wanderer

   velasquez said red he was laugh-
ing now-a peculiar sort of a laugh
hes come to claim his schooner

   why does he carry that line asked
mark

    tis a custom thats old as the sea
said red and he turned those flaring
eyes toward tanya ten fathom of line
with a noose in the end-sure its more
than enough for a pirate

   the gun crashed again and a stay was
cut but the dancer seemed to be circled
with luck she was close in now-five
hundred yards-and each minute
brought her closer pedersons voice
came over the water as fie roared an
order to the crew

   now the gun on the cliff was holding
its fire the schooners were beam and
beam the dancers bow dropped down
with the wind and she raced past the
wanderers stern

  now pederson nows the time
cried red the wheel spun and the
dancer turned in a beautiful pirouette
ah me the swede is a sailor

   captain schmidt had gathered his men
and now they waited near the rail as the
dancers bow came into the wind the
schooners headway carried her on while
her canvas rattled as her tall sails luffed

   then a rifle spoke and a man on the
schooner put both hands to his chest and
sat down there was another shot and
then a third

   the dancers bow rubbed the wander-
ers beam smoothly quietly the two
ships closed

captain schmidt took careful aim at
velasquez who still swung his rope but
hed waited too long velasquez leaped
and the line went twisting through the
air it caught the german full in the
face and the captains shot went wild

mark felt something tug at his wrists
he turned and found tanya at his shoul-
der her fingers were working at the
lashings that bound his arms behind his
back

flanagans hands were already free
and just for a moment the great red man



crouched at the rail while he flexed his
fingers the crew of the dancer was
swarming aboard and the germans were
running to meet them

    youre free said tanya her voice
 was low

chapter xxviii

sea-patch

 jltark rubbed his hands and looked
 about four wooden belaying pins
 were racked at the stays he grabbed
 one and started forward

   and just ahead of him went red
flanagan leaping along the dancers
deck like some monstrous jungle cat
red laughed as he ran and he laughed
as he hit

    a german moved a gun into line but
 his wrist was caught in a crushing grip
 that made him scream aloud red lifted
 him high and ran to the rail

   the german screamed again then
 mark heard a splash and red was back
 looking for captain schmidt 

    mark saw a close-cropped head near-
 by and he swung at it with his belaying
 pin he hit a shoulder but that was all
 right the german staggered

    mark tried a second time he heard
 the pin hit and he liked the sound then
 turned to block a thrust from a knife
 he took the blade on his forearm and
 wrist

    it was strange but he felt no pain he
 swung again and the man went down
 mark looked for another and found
 velasquez standing at his side

    the tall dark man was showing his
 teeth in a most peculiar grin his hands
 were tight on a germans throat and he
 shook the man as a terrier might

 mark heard a snap and then a laugh
 velasquez reached for another

 and up ahead sounded flanagans
 voice it roared above the noise of the
 fight

    hi captain schmidt cried the big
 red man ive a debt to pay for griffith
 and burke will you try a waltz with
 me

 jvtark wanted to watch but he didnt
 l-- dare men were swarming the deck
 of the dancer he lifted his pin and ran
 toward one then felt a hand on his
 shoulder

 velasquez was laughing and shaking
 his head the fight-it is over

 it was as he said these men were
 friends-deep-water men of the indies
 they raced to the halyards the mainsl
 broke free and climbed quickly up the
 mast

 mark heard the rattle of anchor chain
 and the sound of a deep-sea chantey
 hurrying feet walked the capstan around
 more canvas flew aloft the wanderer
 felt the urge of the wind and put her
 best foot forward

 there was little work for a novice to
 do mark would only be in the way he
 turned and saw tanya at the rail be-
 side her was connie lunquist both
 women watched the forward deck where
 two men faced each other

 captain schmidt was a heavy man
 his arms were long and his back was
 strong and he knew how to use his fists

 -- he was using them now in hard pun-
 ishing blows that slammed against
 flanagans jaw red took them in silence
 and kept moving in his arms were
 spread and his fingers were wide his
 chin was tight on his chest

then those arms reached out and
closed like a vise just under the ger-
mans elbows one of reds hands found

 the wrist of its mate it locked and red
 started to squeeze

  the veins went black on the captains
forehead as he tried to break the grip
his chin lifted high and his head dropped
back

  he tried with a knee and battered the
face that was held so close to his own

  do you like my waltz whispered
flanagan

mein lieber gott gasped schmidt
red dropped his chin on the captains
chest and his monstrous shoulders
arched mark heard a gasp that was al-
most a sob

  then he felt a hand on his arm con-
nies fingers were clenched on his wrist
her eyes were wide and her cheeks were
drawn as she watched the struggling
giants

   i think wed better go aft said mark
quietly

  yes-please mark

  as he turned away mark saw another
woman watching the fight tanya who
might have been watching a dance for
all the emotion she showed he started
toward her then changed his mind it
was tanyas man who was fighting

jel a sq uez was aft at the wheel of
 his wanderer and the schooner
seemed to know it she was doing her
best and a good best at that her sails
were full and her stays were taut the
lee rail dipped in a smother of foam as
she followed the dancer out of the bay
to the blue water of the caribbean

  velasquez grifined my darling eh
they think they can steal my sweet-
heart he shook his head and his teeth
gleamed white this is not so these
fools should know velasquez would
come to get her

  the schooners were racing bow to
stern and now the gun on the cliff
picked up the shell came first and
landed wide then the sound of the shot
came bucketing after

  oho cried velasquez they try to
stop us they want us to stay but velas-
quez is in one very big hurry

  the next shot was bad and so was the
third then the gun crew settled down
a shell broke water just under the stern
and spray dashed over the wheel

  mark fooked at the cliff and watched
the flashes and he knew what it meant
to be helpless he wasnt afraid but he
wanted to answer wanted to hit back

   connie had left for the cabin he didnt
blame her it wasnt easy to watch that
gun throw steel at the schooners mark
wondered if he ought to go below and
talk with her

  then he stopped wondering connie
was coming across the deck with band-
age and antiseptic mark glanced at his
arm and wished he hadnt the cut sud-
denly started to ache

   lets have it said connie she tore
the shirt away to his elbow if youre
not the darndest nuisance i ever met
youll do till he comes along this arm
is a mess so is your head

  its worth the scratch to get such a
nurse answered mark but dont you
think you should stay below and do
what you can for hugo

   hes all right except for a bit of cuss-
 ing and damning angry because he
 missed the fight

  a shell landed aft and connie winced
but she went ahead with her work
velasquez watched and nodded his head
then he turned to wink at mark

   she is brave that one he said the
shells are close but she is not afraid

 dont kid yourself snapped connie
im frightened to death
velasquez laughed by gar so am

then stop laughing and show it said
connie she finished with marks arm
and dabbed antiseptic on a cut that
streaked velasquez cheek your
schooner is lazy i could make better
time on a bicycle

yeiaquez sighed as he glanced at
 mark and his shoulders moved in a
latin shrug he turned and lifted a hand
in welcome to flanagan who was coming
toward the wheel

tanya walked at reds side and there
was amusement in her eyes when they
met those of velasquez

i noticed you swinging a rope with
a noose she said was that meant for
me velasquez

for certain he answered and
nodded his head just so soon as i get
one moment of time i will stretch your
pretty neck

reds laugh was loud as he looked at
tanya what did i tell you me lady
mark wanted to ask about captain
schmidt then he realized there was no
need the only men on the wanderers
deck were those who were old to the
indies the others were gone

and as he looked he heard the scream
of another shell this one was close the
gun had the range

the next shot crumpled the wander-
ers rail as it plowed past into the sea

pedersons clear said flanagan or
they couldnt be favoring us alone five
minutes more and weu make it too
the gun was firing faster now a
topsl shredded and a spar came down
then a shell crashed into the deck and
drove clear down through the hull

the wanderer staggered and slipped
down wind velasquez spun the wheel
the bow came up and she held her
course

the next shell landed just off the
stern the next was further back

made it cried red he pointed
ahead now make for yonder island
velasquez the tide is running toward
the ebb so dont lose any time well
careen the schooner and plug the hole
then back to vanity point

the crew of the wanderer was already
at work some ran below to build
quick bulkhead others were rigging a
collision mat two loops of line had gone
over the bow and men were hauling
them aft

still others had brought a spare sail on
deck and carried it to the rail the lines
were made fast to two corners of this
and the canvas was started over the side
just forward of the hole

velasquez put the schooner hard up
when she slowed to a walk the lines
were hauled from the far side of the
deck

the men bent their backs and the sail
ran over the side the wash of the wa-
ter eased it astern until it had covered
the hole

then the lines were made fast while
the rest of the crew raced below to help
build the bulkhead planks were torn
from the splintered deck and even the
broken spar was used

but now the schooner had gathered
headway and velasquez steered for the
island

chapter xxix

goodbye to a giant

the afternoon was almost gone when
mark hallam climbed with connie
toward the crest of the hill that centered

the island he paused a moment to look
out over the caribbean

  pedersons schooner was anchored off
 shore and his men were working with
 velasquez crew racing the tide that was
 coming back as they patched the hull of
 the wanderer

  shed been careened high on the hard
 white sand of the gently sloping beach
 and just beyond near the dancers small
 boat red flanagan walked with tanya
 padilla along the waters edge

  they were hand in hand and their
 heads were close and once mark saw
 flanagan lift an arm to point toward the
 anchored schooner

  mark turned away connies fingers
 werejtwisting a blossom of wild sea is-
 land cotton whose seeds had ridden the
 warm tropic wind that came from the
 nearby barbados a tangle of fern was
 about her ankles and the spiked green
 leaves of a century plant reached almost
 to her shoulders

  connie lifted her head and the bright
 sun built a sheen on the mass of auburn
 hair she looked along the winding path
 then turned to glance at mark

  how soon do we leave for vanity
 she asked

  red claims the wanderer will be
 afloat within three hours that means
 well probably reach vanity before mid-
 night

 -	and then

  mark shrugged a radio message to
 admiral stackley and a suggestion for
 target practice either that or a quick
 trip to washington for a personal re-
 port

  what happens to tanya

  im sure i dont know shes reds
 prisoner not mine

  he took connies hand and climbed
 the rise to the leaning palm that red had
 described as an excellent place to sit
 and watch the gulls it was all red had
 promised

  connie seated herself on the trunk
 patted her hand on the smooth wood and
 looked questioningly at mark

  this was reds idea you know he
 said he insisted i bring you here for
 the view

  the view is that the reason you
 came all the way up here

  one of the reasons

  whats the other

  a red-headed girl with very blue
 eyes and a very bad temper too

  my temper is always under control
 said connie she looked at mark and
 grinned well almost always

  can i depend upon that

   if you do youre crazy

  she continued to grin at him and her
 eyes were very bright now and she leaned
 a little toward him

 mark drew a deep breath red said
  the same about tanya they were
 up here a while ago he smiled and
 leaned against the tree beside connie i
 wonder what they were talking about
 themselves of course

  theyre a strange pair connie i
 doubt if there are two people like them
 in all the world eternal wanderers
 searching for something without a name
 treasure they call it

  he laughed and glanced at connie
 when they find a treasure they dont
 know what to do with it

  why do you say that

  that oil well of tanyas mark
 chuckled she asked me to give it to
 madam tulon

but why did she drill for oil if-
merely as a blind so she would have a
reason for being in the indies she didnt

expect to bring in a well and when she
did she gave it away shes like red
only happy when shes searching the
world for an indefinite something a
something neither of them will ever find
alone

  perhaps theyll find it together said
connie softly

  perhaps said mark he turned and
looked toward the anchored schooner
then he lifted an arm and pointed look
connie the dancers mainsl is going up
thats odd i didnt know there was any-
one aboard

  neither did i connie swung her legs
and jumped to the ground then turned
to look at the dancer mark-on the
branch of that tree

  what is it

  come here if you stand next to mt
and look at the dancer youll see some-
thing hanging from the branch just ahead
of us

lyjark did as he was told on a level
with his eyes as he looked at the
schooner was a small leather pouch that
hung by a thong he walked forward
took the pouch from the tree and looked
at it curiously

  connie was at his shoulder her fin-
gers wiggled as she reached for the
string

  open it oh hurry

  it belongs to red he answered its
the pouch he always wears about his
throat youve seen it before connie
open it

 mark drew the string and dipped in-
side a folded paper crackled against his
fingers he spread it and the two black
pearls rolled into his hand-reds stake
in the race they had never run

  there was a message on the paper
written in bold broad characters-letters
that looked as if they could come only
fromthe hand of red flanagan

  mark started to read but connie was
impatient she snapped the message
then her mouth went round and her
brows went high as she looked at mark
and then again at the paper

  listen to this she said quietly and
she read when you see the dancer
put to sea no doubt youll find this too
pearls for your ladys ears mark youd
have won them if we raced

  the devil i would muttered mark
be quiet said connie she con-
tinued ive paid pederson for his
schooner though tanya suggested we
steal it a rare one that red-headed girl
of mine i doubt that ill know a mo-
ments peace for the rest of me natural
life and neither will you if you take my
tip and ask-

  go on said mark finish it

  if you take my tip connie continued
and ask connie to be your wife but
who could resist them the beautiful
things with their flaming hair and lovely
eyes and lips that taste of the mornings
breeze when it ripples across the carib-
bean

  is that all asked mark

  not quite

  what else does he say

  connie looked again at the paper her
voice was low so take your connie
tight in your arms and kiss the tips of
her tmy ears-ive tried it with tanya
and found that i like it-and turn again
toward the sea to wave a long farewell to
me for red flanagans found his treasure
at last and hes taking her far away
and thats the end asked mark
yes said connie

mark took one of her hands in his he
dropped the two dark pearls into the
curved palm and rounded the fingers

recently we received a particularly
interesting account of how one of our
readers judges a story in brief he says
that if he can see the story then he
knows it is good

 apparently he is a man with a very
strong visual imagination and so reading
a vivid description of a place or an inci-
dent is for him precisely like seeing it in
front of him a picture forms in his mind
static or in motion as the moment of the
story requires if the picture doesnt take
form if it is blurred and confused he
considers the story unsatisfactory

 undoubtedly that is a sound way to
judge a story providing that the reader
is equipped to do it that is providing
that words bring pictures into his mind
but they dont for everyone in fact the
visual imagination is seldom as strong as
our correspondents seems to be

 we would guess that a good many
people can follow a story clearly and with
enjoyment and yet not see it happening
it disappoints them if it doesnt seem
plausible if the people are unreal but
they think about the story rather than
visualize it one method is not neces-
sarily inferior to the other theyre just
different

  well all this has been very abstract
and were out of our depth so well turn
quickly to the gentleman who is respon-
sible

     g r townsend

   i	wonder how many of your read-
  ers read a story the way i do i got
  to thinking about it the other night
  and i decided to write in to argo-
  notes just out of curiosity this is
  how a good story affects me i read
  it and i see it just as if it were a
  scene outside my window or as if i
  were at the moving pictures

    for a long time i didnt realize what
  happened when i was reading but
  one time i started wondering why i
  didnt like a certain story and i
  finally decided it was because the
  story wasnt real and clear i could-
  nt see it it was just words so then

  i	realized that i had to see an actual
  picture of what happened and where
  it happened or else i didnt like the
  story

    for instance i could see the le-
  gionnaires and the fighting in robert
  carses stepsons of france i could
  see thewhole thing just as if i had
  been thete but i have never been
  to africa in my life another case is
  a mase mckay story i can always
  see the glades when i am reading
  one of them

    on the other hand i have read a
  half dozen serials about old cali-
  fornia by johnston mcculley and
  they all seemed poor to me because i
  couldnt see them i havent any idea
  what that part of california used to
  look like

   what i want to know is do all
  people read this way or not

  dallas texas

 t ets hear from the rest of you about
 your methods of judging a story
 do you read as mr townsend does if
 not then how the subject is a fascinat-
 ing one

 our next correspondent wants to know
 what has happened to dave mcnally
 well that amiable miracle man was ab-
 sent from argosy for quite a while but
 you will be glad to know that we have
 just received a new story about him it
 will be reaching you shortly

philip witherbee

   i	have got a complaint to make
 where is dave mcnally what has
 happened to him a couple of years
 ago we used to get plenty of stories
 by richard wormser about his freak-
 hunting hero not any more not in
 a long time anyhow as far as i am
 concerned dave mcnally is the best
 series character in argosy and i
 dont want to see him dropped s
 wake up mr wormser

   now that i have made my com-
 plaint i want to compliment you on
 the serials that have been in argosy
 recently they are better than ever
 before i think-especially the ones
 by max brand judson p philips
 richard sale louis c goldsmith
 and bennett foster all different and
 all good

 new york n y

 again it is pleasant to make space for
 our indefatigable correspondent-

w w llewellyn

   here i go again

 how about asking nelson s bond
 to write us a long fantastic serial

 i	think that bond is about the best
 in this field except perhaps edgar
 rice burroughs so how about it

 farewell to the indies

         c continued from page 
  above them then he did as red flana-
  gan had told him to do and he too found
  that he liked it

  look said connie when she was able
  to talk the dancers leaving the bay

 mark stood with connie anc watched
 the schooner he lifted a hand and waved
 it once he thought he saw an answering
 wave from the red-headed giant who
 stood at the wheel with one arm about
 his lady

 then the dancer tacked across the
 wind and put out for the open sea

the end

long road to tomorrow

         continued from page 
  got a hunch you will ive heard your
  voice sound like that before more power
  to you dikar he tried to pull away
  and in the dark dikar could just make
  out his twisted grin good luck boy

    wait walt dikar held on listen
  theres somethin i want you to do for
  me when you get back to norrisdam i
  -i couldnt lie to marilee i couldnt tell
  her i was just goin away for a little while
  so-so i didnt tell her anythin at all
  will you go and tell her that i-that ive
  gone away from her far an far an that
  im not ever comin back will you
  walt

    no i wont tell marilee that youre
  not coming back i dont even want to
  think of it myself you are coming back
  dikar

    maybe i am maybe a long long time
  from now when weve chased the asa-
  frics out of america ill come back to
  marilee but i cant till then an i dont
  want her waitin and waitin for me

   i want her to be mad at me so mad
 that shell stop lovin me the first hurt
 will be worse that way but it will be
 over quicker an then marilee will forget
 me an-and find herself another mate

   when walt spoke his voice was low
 and kind of shaky i guess youre right
 i guess- all right ill tell her he
 rubbed his hand down his leg stuck it
 out at dikar

    dikar took walts hand and squeezed
  and then walt was going back to the
  truck and dikar was going toward the
  river through the tumbled jungle of the
  burned houses

    the blackened timbers were almost as
  thick as the trees of the woods but they
  did not smell like the trees they must
  have burned a long time ago but the
  smell of their burning stuck to them and
  there was a smell of something else that
  had burned-not wood but flesh

   dikar stopped all of a sudden the
 blackened timbers blotting out any sight
 of sky or road the rough wood hurting
 his feet he stood rigid his lip curling a
 prickle running up and down his back

   dikar couldnt see anything he
 couldnt hear anything but he knew
 there were eyes on him somewhere in
 this dark

    dikars hand went to the butt of his
  gun closed on it someone hidden in
  these black gaunt ruins was looking at
  him

   there was a sudden swoosh behind
 him and a burst of leaping light walt
 had fired the truck out from between
 two black timbers a wild shape leaped at
 dikar knife gleaming as it sliced down
 at him dikar brought up his gun to
 shoot-

    from behind cold fingers clamped his
  wrist jerked the revolver sidewise

          free from the outer air into the heart of the
          gas mixture it is entirely automatic and
