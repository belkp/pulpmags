   usual magazine stories perhaps a little different perhaps a good deal it may violate a canon of literature or a custom of maga-
   zines or merely be different from the type usually found in this magazine the difference may lie in unusual theme material
   ending or manner of telling no question of relative merit is involved

protection

without the presence of the coast guard
coastwise shipping would be in constant
danger when seas are smooth and winds kind
these men are ready for the first sign of trouble
then when lives and cargoes are endangered
by raging storms the real need for this protection
is most keenly felt

without the presence of a colt revolver or auto-
matic pistol your home is also far from well pro-
tected a colt in the house gives a constant sense
of security but it is when your property is en-
dangered that the readiness and dependability of
your colt is most appreciated

the colt positive lock is as reliable as the arm
itself and makes the colt safe against accidental
discharge

 any colt dealer or the new colt catalog
 will explain this colt positive lock safety

times feel it to be the truth-he knows why further-
more he knows how to overcome it-in five minutes-
and he showed me how

  this man offers no such bromides as setting-up
exercises deep-breathing or any of those things you
know at the outset youll never do he uses a prin-
ciple that is the foundation of all chiropractic naprap-
athy mechano-therapy and even osteopathy only
he does not touch a hand to you it isnt necessary

  the reader will grant bradstreets method of stay-
ing young worth knowing and using when told that
its originator whose photograph reproduced here was
taken a month ago is ixty-five years old

  and here is the secret he keeps his spine a half-
inch longer than it ordinarily would measure

  any man or woman who thinks just one-half inch
elongation of the spinal column doesnt make a differ-
ence should try it it is easy enough ill tell you
how first though you may be curious to learn
why a full-length spine puts one in an entirely new
class physically the spinal column is a series of
tiny bones between which are pads or cushions of
cartilage nothing in the ordinary activities of us
humans stretches the spine so it settles day by
day until those once soft and resilient pads become
thin as a safety-razor blade-and just about as hard
ones spine the most wonderfully designed shock-
absorber known is then an unyielding column that
transmits every shock straight to the base of the brain

  do you wonder folks have backaches and head-
aches that ones nerves pound toward the end of a
hard day or that a nervous system may periodically
go to pieces for every nerve in ones body connects
with the spine which is a sort of central switchboard
when the insulation or cartilage wears down and
flattens out the nerves are exposed or even impinged
-and there is trouble on the line

  now for proof that subiaxation of the spine causes
most of the ills and ailments which spell age in
men or women flex your spine-shake it out-
and they will disappear youll feel the difference in
ten minutes at least i did its no trick to secure
complete spinal laxation as bradstreet does it but
like everything else one must know how no amount
of violent exercise will do it not even chopping wood
as for walking or golfing your spine settles down
a bit firmer with each step

  mr bradstreet had evolved from his -year experi-
ence with spinal mechanics a simple boiled-down for-
mula of just five movements neither takes more than
one minute so it means but five minutes a day but
those movements i never experienced such com-
pound exhilaration before i was a good subject for
the test for i went into it with a dull headache at the
end of the second movement i thought i could actually
feel my blood circulating the third movement in
this remarkable spine-motion series brought an
amazing feeling of exhilaration one motion seemed
to open and shut my backbone like a jack-knife

  j asked about constipation he gave me another
motion-a peculiar writhing and twisting movement-
and fifteen minutes later came a complete evacuation

  hobart bradstreet frankly gives the full credit for
his conspicuous success to these simple secrets of
spine-m otion he has traveled about for years con-
ditioning those whose means permitted a specialist at
their beck and call i met him at the roy croft inn at
east aurora incidentally the late elbert hubbard
and he were great pals he was often the fras

hobart bradstreet the man who declines to grow old

guest in times past  but bradstreet young as he
looks and feels thinks he has chased around the
country long enough he has been prevailed upon to
put his spine-motion method in form that makes it
now generally available

  i know what these remarkable mechanics of the spine
have done for me i have checked up at least twenty-five
cases with all sincerity i say nothing in the whole realm
of medicine or specialism can quicker re-make rejuvenate
and restore one i wish you could see bradstreet himself
he is arrogantly healthy he doesnt seem to have any
nerves yet he pulfs incessantly at a black cigar that
would floor some men drinks two cups of coffee at every
meal and i dont believe he averages seven hours sleep
it shows what a sound nerve-mechanism will do he says
a mans power can and should be unabated up to the age
of  in every sense and i have had some astonishing
testimony on that score

  would you like to try this remarkable method of
coming back or if young and apparently normal in
your action and feelings do you want to see your energies
just about doubled it is easy no apparatus is re-
quired just bradstreets few simple instructions made
doubly clear by his photographic poses of the flve posi-
tions results come amazingly quick in less than a
week youll have new health new appetite new desire
and new capacities youll feel years lifted off mind and
body this miracle-mans method can be tested without
any advance risk if you feel enormously benefited
everything is yours to keep and you have paid for it all the
enormous sum of  knowing something of the
fees this man has been accustomed to receiving i hope
his naming  to the general public will have full
appreciation

  the  which pays for everything is not sent in ad-
vance nor do you make any deposit or payment on
delivery try how it feels to have a full-length spine and
youll henceforth pity men and women whose nerves are
in a vise

amp towels are dangerous hamper companions

jor chiffon stockings

when delicate silks are put in a hamper with
the towels sheets and colored cottons of the
weekly wash they wear out long before they
have given the service you have reason to
expect of them

  why because even though not obviously
soiled they contain perspiration acids from the
skin which are kept moist by the hamper damp-
ness and destroy the silk fibres

  so to preserve fragile garments and prolong the
  length of their service many women have made it
  a habit to tub them in ivory suds as soon as pos-
  sible after they are worn whether they look
  soiled or not

in this way acid action and the fading and
streaking that come from tossing such garments
into stuffy hampers are all prevented all delicate
things reward this simple care with far longer life

  of course a soap that is the
slightest bit too strong will
spoil your whole effort by in-
juring the fabrics and colors

   ivory cake or flakes is safe

for as you know ivory has

for  years protected the complexions of
millions of women

  the best test we know of for determining
the safety of any soap for delicate silks and
woolens is this ask yourself would i use it
on my face

how to wash blankets safely

harsh soap rubbing and extremes of tempera-
ture cause sensitive wool fibres to mat down
shrink and become hard and scratchy

  keep blankets fluffy by squeezing lukewarm
ivory suds through the fabric rinsing in luke-
warm water and airing well

  the ivory suds assures you of beautiful safe
results and absolute cleanliness

n the midst of what appeared
to be an old pasture was a small
wooden house one of the port-
able type such as one sees at
summer resorts and on the fringes of great
cities where bank clerks and what-not are
getting back to the land

 before the door of the house was a line
of men waiting patiently this house
however was not a home but the head-
quarters of a rest camp where men new-
landed in france were taken to recuperate
they wore the olive drab of the united
states army but though they were mem-
bers of the american expeditionary force
they did not wear the overseas cap they
wore campaign hats with hat-cords of

  to a cavalry regiment

    these men were all unarmed save one
  who carried a rifle and had a pistol hung
  to his cartridge belt which he wore in true
  cavalry fashion around his hips as a shim-
  my dancer wears a sash

    the men spat and shifted from one foot
  to the other and gazed at the sky they
  were prisoners awaiting trial by the sum-
  mary court and the man with the rifle
  was guarding them the men were sad
  and their eyes bloodshot this was a
  monday morning and the joy of saturday
  or sunday night had turned into a headache
  and a rebellious stomach that which had
  soothed and exhilarated going down had
  not been as pleasant on its return journey
  therefore the men stood sullenly said

adventure

nothing to each other even in undertones
and cursed the tardy court

  the court had a throat and a head as
well as any one else but the court had no
husky sergeant of the guard to get him out
of his bunk hence he was late nor was
his lateness due to dallying overlong with
his breakfast he had no more stomach
for breakfast than had the prisoners

  suddenly every head in the line went up
there was a stir among the men but it was
not a stir of stiffening to attention but
rather one of surprize an imperceptible
murmur rippled along the line

  cut out the talkin growled the guard
and ejected a yard of tobacco juice to show
how unconcerned he was

  two soldiers were approaching the line
of men both wearing the chevrons of ser-
geants one wore a pistol and the other
was unarmed they came on side by side
young men of about the same height lithe
and spare as good cavalrymen should be

  their blouses fitted them like their skins
and the peg of their breeches was like that
of a hemisphere those were good breeches
made by the troop tailor out of old-time
overcoats and stitched with yellow silk
at the pockets their leggings were of the
type that lace up the side but of solid
leather and so polished and shined that they
glittered and cast little circles of light about
each foot

  the two sergeants went past the line
never looking to right or left and having
gone a little apart halted and leaned against
the side of the building under one of the
windows the prisoners looked at them
open-mouthed

  there was sergeant colburn of a troop
evidently a prisoner and guarded by ser-
geant olsen his buddy they would have
been less astonished to see their colonel
under guard

  sergeant colburn was as fine a soldier
as there was in the regiment he was a crack
horseman and he wore the mexican ex-
peditionary ribbon above the silver marks-
manship medals that showed he was both
rifle and pistol expert

  yet here he was waiting his trial and un-
der guard this last was the most extraor-
dinary thing for non-commissioned officers
are not placed in confinement nor under re-
straint except for the very gravest offenses

  sergeant colburn seemed to be the one
who was least disturbed he manufactured

a cigaret and proceeded to smoke it with
satisfaction sergeant olsen looked at him
intently and then catching the others eye
carried it to where the butt of sergeant
olsens pistol protruded from the texas
style holster right within easy grasp of ser-
geant colburns hand sergeant colburn
affected not to see it the other sergeant
coughed and repeated the performance
with no effect

  nell said the sergeants guard whats
the matter with you you blind or what
can you see that gun or not you aint
handcuffed

  be yourself grinned colburn dont
every man in this regiment know were
buddies wanta serve my time for me
and while i was grabbin your gun and mak-
in my getaway what would that john
from b troop be doin hed rather let
a slug through me than be a lance jack
nell groaned the other sergeant what-
ever did you do it for why dont you ask
em to put your trial over till the old man
comes back hell fix things for you
before the other could answer the guard
with the rifle barked attention and
there was a stiffening of backs while the
summary court the commanding officer of
the first squadron walked past and en-
tered the building

  the prisoners all looked at him intently
as he passed they noted that his eyes
were slightly bloodshot that his face was
haggard and that he spat what seemed to
be a little piece of cotton as he went up
the steps every one was expectorating
that morning the mens hearts sank

  beneath the window the two sergeants
heard the major enter the courtroom grunt
an answer to the clerks good morning
throw his hat on the desk kick his chair
and growl send em along thereupon
nell colburn spoke in loud clear tones

  i heard a rumor said he that my
troop was goin up to the front and the front
is no place for me i like it too well right
here in camp genicart so i didnt see
no other thing to do than to get put in the
mill and for a good long stretch and when
i get out the war will be over

  shut up husked sergeant olsen he
can hear you that windows got paper in
it in place of glass dont yuh know that
the prisoner was immediately silent and
answered his companions look of horror
with a wide grin
a sergeant of cavalry

ordinarily the sergeant
would have been tried first but
in this case he was not and so
waited until all the other men had
filed in and filed out and when the last one
had paid his call on judge duffy-any
summary court is so called in the army-
the sergeants name was called and he
went in

  sergeant nelson colburn troop a
th united states cavalry you are charged
with violation of the ist article of war in
that you did neglect your proper duty while
commander of the guard on or about july
  this at camp genicart france
guilty or not guilty

  guilty sir

  by- snorted the major if this

charge sheet was properly made out it
would be a general court martial affair
you ought to be shot suppose that jerry-
had escaped

  he wouldnt escape sir said colburn
he told me we feed him better than he
ever got in his life

  well thats beside the point the fact
remains that you allowed a prisoner of war
to be absent from the camp and beyond
our control for an unknown length of time
and that is a very serious offense the
french are wild it makes no difference
if he did come back he was gone and we
dont know where for a whole afternoon

  your troop-commander is away so that
i couldnt consult with him but it was my
intention to overlook a good deal and give
you a mild sentence on the strength of your
record i had in mind to confine you to
camp for a month but ive changed my
mind i heard you utter sentiments just
now that are traitorous that a yellow cur
wouldnt own to youre a disgrace to the
regiment a dishonor to the uniform i
still think you ought to have a general
court and if it wasnt for the good name of
the regiment id see you got one youre

guilty as- ill fix you get out

  the sergeant took his departure he
was received by sergeant olsen the latter
at the point of tears

  theyll hang you sure said olsen
whatever made you do it

  come on over to quarters oley said
colburn i wont let you suffer come
on over and ill spill it dont make any
more motions about my getting away
because i dont want to make any getaway

and some one might hear you theres
no use in losing your stripes

  they proceeded in silence through the
camp where cooks police troop clerks
and hangers about who were not at drill
regarded them with horror they passed
two german prisoners one carrying a pick

and shovel and the other pushing a wheel-
barrow herded along by a very diminutive
french soldier one of these prisoners
grinned at colburn and the sergeant
dropped his eyelid in reply

  is that the bird asked olsen

  thats him

  who put him the mouse on his eye

  i dont know said colburn things
were hectic i aint kiddin yuh and if
thats all he got out of a bottle barrage
hes lucky

  the two went into the barrack where the
sergeants were quartered the place was
deserted all the occupants being at drill or
off about their business somewhere and
the prisoner and his guard had the place
all to themselves

  now began olsen sitting swn on a
bunk spill it lets hear all about it
theres more cook-house rumors afloat
than i ever heard in my life but lets get
the low-down was you drunk or did the
sun get to yuh

  to begin at the beginning said col-
burn unhooking his blouse and hunting for
cigaret material it was a saturday morn-
ing id been reading the newspapers and
everything and all they say is that the
americans won a great victory at chateau -
thierry then that the frogs have taken
soissons and that the boche are in full
retreat it looks as if the war might be
over any day


adventure

  well now i felt pretty sad there
wis all that fightin goin on and me here
ridin herd on draftees just landed and goin
on guard every four nights and tryin to
make france a desert by drinkin up all
the liquor in it so feeling sad i wanted
comfort

  well along about then comes the little
frog with the jerry latrine squad and i had
a bright thought that id take one of em
over and straighten out my stuff for in-
spection which would save me a lot of
work so i wandered over here with this
squarehead well i started to show him
what i wanted done you know and makin
signs like a chink tellin you how much the
laundry was and this bird sounds off in
english not awful good but still you
knew what he was talkin about

   make up the blankets says i showin
him how an put the shoes under the bunk
and hang that towel straight and whisk
the broom a bit well he was glad enough
to do that instead of what he was supposed
to do you fellars got good shoes says
he putting mine away thats a nice
coat pointing to joe shupps hangin on
the wall try it on i says for the fun of
it so he tries it on then the old nick comes
out from under the bunk and whispers
in my ear

   howd yuh like to go out and have a
ball of vin rooge says i

   the police he moans theyd kill
me

   ill put you on a uniform i says an
you an mell go for a pasear down to the
gate an back an you can have a drink and
then well come back an go to work 

  you crazy boob interjected oley

  shut up directed colburn no re-
marks well the jerry climbs into shupps
uniform and out we went of course the
frog had gone back to his stockade and
none of our gang knew this here jerry so
we got away strong i expected to get
burned for leaving camp while i was on
guard and that was all i took the jerry
along to get some dope from him about the
war he wasnt part of the original plan

  what plan asked olsen

  dont interrupt now he wasnt part
o the plan well we went out the gate
and i chewed the rag with number four
a minute and told him to keep his ojo
peeled for the o d because i knew hed
be just as happy as a bug on a hot stove

watchin for the o d and tryin to see him
in time to give me the office and o course
the o d would see him sneak off post to
tell me so i thought i was all set

  then we went down to that gin mill on
the corner about then the fun began
there was a bunch of frogs in there guys
on leave i guess all in uniform and all
drinkin death to the boche and readin
out loud about the big fight and my guys
hair stands right up straight

  well i got him into a chair and we had
a couple of shots of wine and i tried to get
some dope out of him about how the war
was fought he aint got no ears for me
so i decided about then that id better get
out of there i began to guess i had the
old steer by the horns then over comes
one o these frogs and allows some thing
about camarade americain and lets have a
drink and he pours us out some stuff hes
got in a canteen

  ray he says death to the boche or
somethin to that effect anyway i heard
the word boche and my jerry friend lets the
frog have his glass right in the mush then
he gives a warcry in dutch well now
ive been in the bucket o blood in thomp-
sonville when the fourth field was doin
m p duty an ive been in one or two bar-
room cleanouts in my time but that was
the liveliest

  all i thought of was to get out and bein
near the door i did they all goin for the
jerry anyway he put a table under a few
o their feet and lets another guy have our
bottle that set me back three francs right
about where he tucks his dinner and then
he comes along of me i guess the wine
kinda got to him or he was just mad as-

  well we run allee same jackrabbits
with all the bottles in that part of france
buzzin by our ears an we got in the gate

and the guard hollers like-and shows

his rifle to the frogs an so we got away

  well who comes in the barracks but
the o d with a moan that theyre one jerry
prisoner short theres only two shovin
the cart and there ought to be three well
i rushes right out with the o d and the
jerrys got sense enough to change his
clothes and he just gets em swapped when
in comes the whole gang inspecting and
catches him in the barracks

  well he says i had him in to police up
around my bunk and so they had me in and
about then some bright lad picks up shupps
a sergeant of cavalry



uniform off the floor and between one
thing and another i get my belt pulled
and thats the end of it only of course
the frogs go and report that a yank gives

colburn weakly

tion of the sentence as relates to confine-
ment and forfeiture of pay is hereby re-

all his rage gone from him

  nell said the top hows chances on
swappin jobs you be the top and ill

- sick of soldierin in this hole i could

cry

  say what do you hombres think i went


adventure

through all this rigamarole for asked
colburn

  you mean to say you went and got
broke and tried and everything to get sent
up to the front cried olsen

  thats whatever agreed colburn
  well how about the commission
  thats all part of it

  well i m -- said the first sergeant
whats the rush theres rumors that
were going up ourselves any time
theres been rumors to that effect ever
since we struck france four months ago
but we aint up yet an i cant wait any
more i got to get going

  well what did you take that jerry out
with you for you could have got broke
without puttin the rope round your neck
by such a fool trick as that

  well i was lonesome and sad and so
was he and i was afraid they might just
break me so i was going to get some dope
from him about the german army and go
down town some night to that cafe where
the m p said they had a spotter tendin
bar and get soundin off an m p told
me that every once in a while some one
sounded off in that place and the next week
he went sailin up to the front

  you -- fool said the top again
they dont send enlisted men up like
that only goldbrick officers that go shootin
off their face when an enlisted man
below grade seven talks too much he gets
his face pushed in he dont get sent to
no front

  well the jerry got snarled with the
frogs and i saw i was in wrong and i didnt
know what id do till i thought of letting
the major hear me say i didnt want to
go to the front and then he might send me
there and sure enough he did i was
goin to get broke and then ask for a
transfer

  how come you thirst to get to the front
like that asked olsen

  well said colburn i crave excite-
ment

  sergeant said olsen addressing the
top go get a doctor this guy is off
his nut complete

  maybe he is said the top but the
orders says to get him to the fourth pro-
visional company and the major told me
if he got away from me not to never show
up here again so gather up your clothes
private and well be goin

two days later the fourth
provisional replacement com-
pany descended from its box
cars at chateau-thierry they
did not need to ask if they were at the front
the railroad station was a wreck a near-by
repair shop was a pile of brick and rusty
iron and the telegraph wires still hung in
great festoons from every pole like spa-
ghetti from a fork they lined the company
up counted noses and ushered them into
some trucks

  do you know what outfit were going
to ex-sergeant colburn asked one of
his companions as they clanged over the
bumpy street

  i dont know said the other n i dont

give a - theyre all the same i

been hounded up an down from this to
that and back again for eight months now
an theyre all the same one hog-wrastle
after another im glad im gettin to
the front at last i waited long enough
whats that sign mean

  the sign was a great black plank with
the word in white on it-

unterstanden

  -fino said nell its a boche sign

this must be where we chucked em out
i wonder how far weve gone say this
was quite a town to be all knocked to
chewin gum its a wonder they couldnt
clean it up

  the truck by now had left the town and
turned into a highroad running out into the
country the white dust billowed up and
surrounded the men so that conversation
came to an end on pain of smothering in
the clouds when the dust would lower
for a second glimpses could be caught of
broken carriages a ditch with german
helmets scattered about in it yank over-
coats hanging to trees a rifle stuck into the
ground by its bayonet

  the men began to show excitement
they wanted to appear calm they wanted
each other to think that the approach of
battle meant nothing to them but the
strain finally became unendurable when
at last a squadron of planes appeared high
overhead in the cloudless sky and black
flowers began to bloom beneath them the
men could restrain themselves no longer

  yay they cheered bring em down

kid hit em in the eye pepper em-

em shoot em all down
a sergeant of cavalry



  look at em they dont mind them shells
a mite aint them gunners got no eyes
at all

  they dont seem to hit within a mile
of em do they

  shut up the bellerin called the driver
of the truck over his shoulder them is
our planes and- the jerries are tryin to
down em

  that so said the men in the truck
well we might a known that our gunners
wouldnt be so far off the target

  you tell em said the truck driver
if you want to see some fine shootin all
over the lot you want to watch some o
them cosmoline anti-aircraft outfits theres
only one thing worse an thats the field
artillery in this mans army half the
time theyre shellin their own roads
well i aint no man to discourage yuh
the driver slowed to a stop as an officer
came out to the road and held up his hand

  are those replacements for the thirty-
first called the officer

  yessir

  well you might as well drop them here
it will save them quite a walk back how
many in there

  it appeared that there were twenty the
fourth company had been composed of a
hundred and forty men which would fur-
nish the replacements for a battalion the
truck that held nell colburn was emptied
and another like it and the officer after
conferring with one of the company offi-
cers who had been on the second truck
formed the men up and marched them into
the woods here they were divided and
nells truckload with some twenty others
taken to a great block of a building on the
edge of the forest

  this here is g company said the man
who had brought them over the top
will be out in a minute

  a guide led colburn around the corner of
the building to a small room that had the
appearance of having been a cow shed at
some time or other

  hey corporal called the guide heres
a friend for yuh

  a red-haired man in his undershirt ap-
peared and colburn was pointed out to
him then the guide passed on with his
other charges

  my names mead said the corporal
looking keenly at nell you ever soldiered
before

  well began nell but the corporal in-
terrupted

  his eye had noted the neatly fitting
blouse the old army breeches and the scar
of the chevrons on the sleeve

  never mind he said quickly i dont
care taint nothin to me cm in and ill
see about a bunk

  within the shed were six men one of
whom wrote a letter another wrapped and
unwrapped a new pair of puttees in an ef-
fort to make them look somewhat present-
able a third placidly cleaned his rifle and
the other two were engaged in a game of
pinochle

  you can sling your pack down in the hay
anywheres said the corporal you wont
need to make up a bunk because were
movin outta here at dark its about time
or the coots would eat us alive the place
is lousy with em

  the men after one look at nell went on
with their occupations they were very si-
lent probably because of the newcomer
and also because of the heat they all had
glaringly new underwear on most of them
had new breeches and some had new shoes

  didnt they give you a new rifle a
man asked suddenly pointing to the en-
field that nell had stood against the wall

  nope said nell thats the only one
ive got i see you fellers got the old
springfield maybe i can buscar one
theyll issue you one out maybe said
the corporal you wouldnt want to lug
that one very far

  itll do to kill one or two squareheads
with said nell smiling

  huh cried two or three at once you
wont kill no squareheads for some time
how come gasped the ex-cavalryman
isnt this the front

  sure its the front but we aint on it
said the corporal we come outta the
lines three days ago and were startin for
rest billets tonight we wont do no more
fightin this summer

  nell said never a word he sat on the
floor his back against a stall and looked at
a german ammunition pouch that had been
souvenired by one of the men it was made
of leather with three oblong pockets and
had wire hooks to hang to the knapsack
straps nell would never get one no more
fighting this summer

  would they mind a guy taking a little
pasear around here asked nell


adventure

  nope said the corporal theres a
boche trench over there on the edge of the
woods you might like to look at

nell went out the sun was
terrific and the fields were dry
and burned the wheat had
been cut by the germans and
either shipped to their field bakeries or home
to germany there was no clamor of bat-
tle no sign of war nothing but the peaceful
aspect of a country landscape distant hills
half seen through the haze and the snaky
road with trucks thundering by from time
to time at intervals a lonely plane buzzed
overhead

  dont it beat- muttered colburn

here i go and get broke to get up to the
front and then dont get there ive known

some-fools in my time but none as big

as me a uck private in a doughboy out-
fit the thirty-first thats a new one
on me must be one o these home-made
regiments like the three hundred and
first cavalry or the fifty-second artillery
bunch of lunatics cooks police to do an
i havent had my hands in a pan for three
years bet they give me recruit drill

huh this is a-of a war no wonder it

lasted four years if this is a sample

  he inspected the old german trench
which was nothing but a shallow ditch with
a few reels of machine-gun ammunition
lying around and a piece of a rifle about
the farm and here and there in the woods
he could see men moving hanging clothes
to dry cleaning rifles or killing time and
meanwhile the war was raging and no
chance of getting to it any more than if he
ex-sergeant colburn were still doing patrol
duty at ruidosa or marfa or any other re-
mote border post

  -s bells and the-to ring em

groaned nell the army in war time is
no place for a guy thats got any ambition
i got just about as much chance of gettin
a commission as a louse has of bein made
commander-in-chief of the armies

  somewhere in the woods a bugle blew
first call for something and whatever it
was it behooved nell to be gone to his
squad which he did and made himself
ready to stand a formation he fell in with
his squad and before assembly blew took a
good look at them

  the formation was evidently retreat
there was much calling of the roll and

checking of numbers and inspection of
equipment which took some time the
company commander a tall nervous man
walked up and down exhorting

  every man got a new gas-mask canis-
ter he cried if i find a man without
one ill skin him alive be sure all your
men have a full allowance of ammunition
corporals fill canteens with water only
let me catch you with wine in them
youll never be able to drink a drop of it
again with comfort

  at this formation nells enfield or model
x rifle was taken away and he was given
a model  known as the springfield
this was the rifle with which his regiment
had been armed and with which he was fa-
miliar this rifle was also lighter than the
later model a thing that he was very thank-
ful for abruptly they were dismissed and
each man without waiting for the call got
his mess kit and lined up by the shed where
the rolling kitchen was then when mess
call blew they were all ready to eat

  colburn ate with his squad they all sat
together against the house wall and he
thought this would be a good chance to get
acquainted with them as he sat down
very gingerly skilfully balancing his mess
kit so that the slum would neither run out
of the meat can nor the apricots off the
cover nor the handle of his cup come un-
done and his coffee all go-ward one of

the men was speaking his mind

  it dont look right said the man for
us to have all this chow tonight slum
an a guy could shut his eyes and make a
stab at it an hit a potato or a piece o meat
every time apricots fer dessert coffee with
canned cream to go in it and all the bread
you want take two i maintain theyre
goin to march us off our feet they may
take us clear across france who knows

  ferget it said a dark swarthy man a
little inclined to stoutness youre off
your head they got all this chow on hand
and want to get rid of it

  you got the idear spagett  said the
corporal with his mouth full

  that so objected the first man
well if thats so then how come all this
moan about havin lots of ammunition
every man have his belt full says the
skipper what for i spose were goin to
shoot snipe or somethin

   bottle you aint got half the brains
-give a mule skinner how we gonna
a sergeant of cavalry



carry our ammunition if the guys dont
lug it in their belts its got to go on wagons
and we aint got too many wagons

  well i wish t-we wasnt inkin to-
night interjected another member o the
squad i believe im cornin down with
my boils again i got a regular peony right
where itll do the most harm ill have a
interestin march kid me for the ammuni-
tion cart the minute it gets dark

  you lemme catch you said the corporal
darkly

  dont worry responded the other
you wont

  then bottle who must be so called be-
cause his name as shouted at retreat was
bartle looked at colburn

  i bet youre glad were goin away from
the front tonight anyway even if we are
hikin it

  well im not said nell not by a-

sight i came up to see some horn tanglin
with the boche and id just as soon see a
little before i go away this wars liable to
be over any day

  after that there was a long moment of
silence then the corporal in view of his
rank spoke

  man said he you wont never regret
goin away from the front we been in
there monkeyin with them krauts for about
a week and were fed up aplenty you
neednt worry about the war bein over
itll run for some time yet an a little of
this fightin stuff does a man a long long
time especially if hes a mud thumper
theres guys right in this squad- here he
looked hard at bottle-that if you was to
yell boche at em good and loud right
now theyd jump clean out from under their
wig

  it aint so said bottle his face a deep
red i aint no more afraid of em than
any one else

  theyre kiddin me said bottle turn-
ing to nell because when we wras going
through some woods some o the guys snarls
up with a machine-gun and while they was
all yellin an givin advice i stepped on a

hornets nest what the - do they

think id stand there an get stung to
death

  i hollered boche grinned the man
called spagett an bottle give a jump that
took him clear out of the advance zone

  i didnt run far said bottle i just
run an jumped in that creek any o you

guys would have if youd stepped on that
bees nest

  the men finished the meal hurriedly for
a few drops of rain had pattered down and
then hurried to the cow shed

  i dont think well start till dark said
the corporal an it may let up before
then

  the men sat in the hot interior of the
shed steaming while the rain poured down
outside it came in sheets and the dark-
ness with it

   nother wet march growled the men
our nice new clothes too when those
trucks get through splashin mud on us
well look worsn we did before

  theres the whistle cried the corporal
suddenly outside every one be sure
you got your breech covers on good an
tight

the march began in a hazy twi-
light it was colburns first
march on foot with a pack and
after the first hundred yards he
was sure he was not going to like it in his
pack were two blankets emergency rations
that had been issued at retreat his mess-kit
and toilet articles a shelter half poles and
pins and an extra pair of shoes

  he got rid of the shoes first since they
were on the outside and could be more
easily discarded

  the company followed the road for some
distance and joined up with the other com-
panies of the battalion then the column
came out on a main road for nell could
hear trucks rattling and the creak of axles
mingling with the stamping of hoofs a
loud cry was heard at the head of the col-
umn and as it was passed back nell could
distinguish what it was

  take hold of the man in front

  nell reached out his hand and got hold of
the straps of a mans pack at the same
time a groping claw came over his shoulder
and took him by the face

  leggo cried nell

  my mistake said the other man
whos that

  colburn

  im goodrich said the other man
my boil is near killin me man aint it
black

  the column toiled along stopping start-
ing and stopping again at times there
were loud rumbles and terrific crashes


adventure

nell thought this was gunfire but the noise
usually followed a lightning flash so that he
decided that it was thunder

  the lightning would show the dripping
column on one side of the road and on the
other a line of trucks moving steadily along
seemingly endless

  the rain came down in torrents it was
like standing under a waterfall the water
ran down the mens faces and so under the
collars of the slickers it ran in between
the hooks in front it dripped from the bot-
tom and soaked down inside the puttee
their shoes were full of water not from the
outside but from this internal seepage

  nell feeling a mysterious bulge discov-
ered that his slicker pocket was full of water
this he emptied and swore feelingly
once the man ahead of him broke awav
from his hold and nell had to grope wildly
for a half minute or so with all the help-
lessness and panic of a drowning man be-
fore he could find him then it was only
because a lightning flash showed him his
man about a yard ahead

  come on cried nell leggo my belt

you-fool how can i catch up with

my man if you hang on to me like that
theres fifty guys got hold of me pro-
tested goodrich

  well tell em to take up the trot

  this was passed back and the men mov-
ing out faster goodrich moaning because of
his boil nell finally found a pack within
the grasp of his hand once more at the
same time he received a sharp blow upon
that portion of him where a kick would be
most apt to land

  hey he cried who the-kicked

me any of you birds want an argument
i wont stand for any rough stuff and you
might as well find it out now as later i can
knock any man for a gool that kicks me
he turned sharply around still keeping
hold of the pack in front and as he did so
goodrich cried out

  ow leggo that rifle gimme that

rifle you - where the - do you

think youre goin

  fresh truck drivers cried several voices
at once and howls from the line of trucks
showed that missiles were being hurled by
the infantry

  there was a glitter of lightning and nell
saw what had hit him there was an am-
munition cart drawn by a limber just be-
side him some part of the limber had

struck him in passing now the cart had a
brake a long thing that stuck up in the air
like a lance and was worked from the limber
by a rope this brake arm had caught
goodrichs slung rifle and was very nearly
tearing it off his shoulder the flash went
out and a chorus of jeers and cries went up
from the column

  wheres he goin with that thing cried
nell but his words were lost in a sharp clap
of thunder

  on the heels of the clap came such a cry
as men hear in their dreams but rarely dur-
ing waking moments another clap nearer
and sharper-blam another shout more
like a shriek the column halted in con-
sternation lightning again the sky as
bright as day but there was a great blot of
shadow on the column on the man in front
of nell on the trucks and the ammunition
cart darkness again a roar of sound and
a great red light

  hey hey a plane a bombin plane
  lay off those bombs were yanks
  git off the road

  under cover

  stay on the road its one of our planes
  boche plane boche plane

  there was another bomb and another
wild cry to the man overhead that the sol-
diers on the road were yanks there was a
sound as of a rushing torrent the rustling of
hundreds of slickers the sucking of hun-
dreds of feet in the muddy ditch the bat-
talion had taken to the fields

  in the first second of horror and confus-
ion colburn went with them but as he
jumped across the ditch the thought oc-
curred to him that if this was a panic he
might obtain some measure of gratitude
from his new officers by helping to stop it
however the officers and non-coms had nc
idea of letting the men get out of hand

  steady g company he could hear
them call and as the men halted he heard
his own corporal commanding

  fourth squad stick around spread out
but dont run no more fourth squad all
right any one hit sound off your names

the men began to call out their
names answering from here and
there in the darkness they were
all present the same thing was
going on all around them corporals assem-
bling squads and sergeants helping lieu-
tenants to re-form shattered platoons
a sergeant of cavalry

ii

  la a little while the men stopped calling
and now another sound that had been un-
heard before began to make itself audible
there was a tremendous mess on the road
there were dead and wounded horses dead
and wounded men trucks with their motors
still running and the hind end of them in
kindling wood

  - muttered nell cant we do

something for those guys out there

  the stretcher bearersll look after em
said some one theyll all be took care of
its kinda tough on em aint it spoke
another man to be knocked off just when
we was goin out to rest billets if we was
goin up to the front now it would be a
blessin to get a little skin knocked off and
get sent out right at the start

  there was a command from the head of
the column

  forward

  a mad scrambling ensued as every one
reached out to take hold of his neighbor
squads and platoons were intermixed men
seized each other and as they started to
move out many found they were going in
circles

  hey cried several we aint gettin
anywheres whose the head o this line
which way do we go

  a sharp voice rose above all the others
not loud or bellowing but crackling like a
whip a voice whose sound was distinguish-
able above the clamor in much the same
fashion that a one-pounder gun can be
clearly heard above all the racket of a bat-
tle

  straighten out here men - my

soul were not playing ring around a rosie
youre worse than the militia first squad
where are you good move out second

squad second squad where the-s the

second squad second squad is that the
second squad what are you doing over
there lying down who told you to lie
down corporal youre a private compree
that youre a private mulkern you
take charge of the squad remember ser-
geant mulkerns a corporal if im a casu-
alty move out now third squad all
right fourth squad come come lets
get going we cant stay here all night

  as they hurried along the edge of the
field nell felt a surge of fear the men
were being hurried as fast as possible from
the scene of the bombing for there is noth-
ing that will wreck the morale of even

veteran troops so quickly as a black night
and the presence of a great number of
wounded calling for first aid

  it was strange though that the men
about nell should have been affected so
suddenly a few minutes before they had
been fairly calm a little breathless a little
jumpy till thej found who had been hit but
not more than mildly excited on the tick
of a second it had all changed breath
whistled through teeth men panted and
coughed and all hurried hurried crowding
and shoving and the atmosphere was
charged with terror

  what the-struck all this gang so

quick asked nell over his shoulder

  he was not answered but from the dark-
ness beside him came excited whispers

   juh hear what the old man said if
im a casualty he says were goin back
to the front

  shut up you ordered the corporal
you got another one o your coke jags
why mightnt the old man be a casualty
think thats the only boche plane thats
out tonight

  that was one o our planes

  wasnt no such a thing our planes got
a light on em thats a boche an he
never knew what luck he had i betcha
how could he tell there was a road there
and it rainin soup and stones to splash it
he was huntin for a dump or a hospital or
somethin in them woods an let them
bombs go for luck

  there was a thud from in front and a
smothered curse on the heels of it a clat-
ter and another thud

  for -s sake pick up your feet

pleaded some one you shoved that-

rifle halfway through me

  theres a ditch here called some one
look out for it

  we must be gettin back to the road
observed the corporal well soon enough
see if were goin back to the front fat
chance we done all our front stuff last
week

  the column was back on the road they
could tell that by the feel of the ground
under their feet and by the roar of the mo-
tors there were not so many here they
were lighter cars by the sound probably
ambulances

  if we could see some trucks observed
an invisible speaker we could tell which
way they was goin and then wed know


adventure

where we was at in this - hole

  cant you tell by the ambulances
asked nell

  naw they might be goin up empty
they rim both ways but trucks usually
only run one way this time o night and
thats up to the front if id only had
sense id have looked when they was splat-
terin mud on us but i was too busy hang-
ing on to the guy ahead

  after a while there was a halt the halt
was signalled by each man running his nose
against the rifle or pack of the man in front
at the same time doing his best to climb up
the back of his legs the men stated their
feelings with some energy of expression but
finding after a minute or so that his was a
real halt and not just a check in the march
to allow traffic to clear up sat down in the
mud and listened to the rain pattering on
their steel helmets

  i begin to think i could sleep said
nell to the man next him i spent the
last two nights in a box car with about
forty other birds and the sleeping quarters
were poor what do they do to you if
you ease off your pack and forget to put
it on again

  i wouldnt said the other man whose
voice showed him to be spagett we
all got new stuff issued us an when we
get back to billets theyll have a show-
down an any one thats shy finds it on
the payroll

  nell sighed the pack was intolerably
heavy it bumped the back of his legs
when he walked and the straps were cutting
his arms off in addition he had a belt full
of ammunition an item that was not the
lightest of all he had on him he wondered
how goodrichs boil was off in the woods
there was a short sharp sound a kind of
crack likea bat meeting a ball for a home
run the resting column woke to instant

   s a g i can

  aint either were outta range

  was that a shell by- it sounded

like one

  the sound occurred again prefaced by a
short whistle

  boy said spagett they done us dirt
those are shells as sure as im sittin in

this mud rest billets - were goin

up again

  do you really think so cried nell
honest to-now

  huh grunted spagett i seen enough
of em you wont be so crazy about goin
to the front this time tomorrow night that
is if you aint pushin up daisies by then

the column moved forward a
few yards and halted again per-
haps to get away from the
shells there was bitter discus-
sion on all sides

  the noise was a shell bursting the noise
was no such thing but men unloading lum-
ber for barracks

  the column was already under fire and
there had been casualties at the head of it

  the column was out of range for they
had just passed a cross roads where they
had lost the road coming up ten days before

  the officers were lost and were going back
to the front instead of away from it

  another short forward stretch and an-
other halt this was prolonged and nell
tried to lie down and get a bit of sleep first
cautioning spagett to awaken him when the
column went forward again this spagett
agreed to do provided he was awake him-
self

  the next thing nell heard was the clang
of a bell and a wild cry he sat up at once
knowing from the stiffness of his limbs that
he had been asleep

   s that cried the men that a gas
alarm

  gas alert was passed sternly up and
down the column and the men who had
been carrying their masks under their arms
put them at the alert position that is
strapped to their chests and waited with
beating hearts for another alarm or the
smell of gas in the air

  curran said the corporal sternly
was that you made that noise

  it fell outta my pack said curran
plaintively

  all right a week in the kitchen for you
when we get to billets i told you to leave
that- thing behind

  whats this asked nell

  aw this dizzy currans got one o those
vases they make outa a  shell the
order is out that we aint to do it no more
and that all that kinda stuff is to be turned
in but currans hangin on to that vase like
grim death he says hes goin to send it
home to his girl hey here comes some
troops

 there was the sound of a column
a sergeant of cavalry



marching down the other side of the road
slop slop slop went their feet their slick-
ers rustled and their equipment rattled
they were moving in a direction opposite
to that in which the column was headed
what outfit called some one
ninety-fourth was the reply

  what

  if there were any sleepers in the column
they awoke now to instant wakefulness at
that cry of rage and chagrin

  you the ninety-fourth the guys that
relieved us

  yup said the inarching men

  they lost the fine called a voice down
the column they couldnt hold it an
we got to go take it back again

  oh the dirty unspeakables howled the
men in the ditch oh the --- milishy
an we lost our rest an everything

  the growl increased opprobrium was
heaped on the marchers hoots and cat-
calls resounded the marchers were too
tired to pay any heed but suddenly some
one who from the way he talked was an
officer began to shout

  listen here you men dont talk that
way to us we volunteered to take over
your sector for you so that you could get

some rest and weve had a-of a time

up there while you were rolling on your
backs and this is all we get for it theres
gratitude for you youre a bunch of
skunks every -- one of you i can lick
any six of you that have got the guts to
come out here and fight you arent fit to
dig latrines for the quartermaster corps
whos there called some one from the
ditch draw it mild draw it mild youre
tired and all that but dont blackguard this
outfit or ill hang a lily on your nose my-
self

  thats our old man cried spagett de-
lightedly hed do it too

  raaazzberry cheered the men in the
ditch secure in the hiding darkness

  just as this interesting point there was a
stir of men getting to their feet and the
march began again

  any doubt about our going to the front
now asked nell

  not for sour-apple juice answered sev-
eral at once

  not so bad thought nell not so bad
things may come our way yet

  then he walked on with better spirits
they turned off the road in a little while

and falling and stumbling went some dis-
tance into black woods

  this is us said spagett and we aint
very near because i dont hear no shells

  if you can find a hole said the cor-
poral get in it if you cant dig yourself
one no one sleeps on top the ground now
mind

  nell could hear muttering the clink of
pick and shovel and the thump of packs
being hurled to the ground he began to
undo his own as some one took him by the
arm

  that you colburn this is corporal
meade hunt around an youll find a hole
there ought to be all kinds of em here
golly theres one i like to broke my neck
falling in to it well that fixes you good-
rich where you at got a hole

  the rest of it nell did not hear he had
lain down in the hole and in spite of the two
or three inches of water in the bottom was
instantly asleep

  nell slowly began to realize that there
was an intermittent pain in his leg that
shifted suddenly to the upper part of hia
body as the pain increased his mind be-
came clearer and he discovered that a man
was prodding him with something he
opened his eyes to see a soldier standing on
the edge of the hole a dim shape against
the mist of early day lifting his rifle and
letting it fall with the motion of one churn-
ing cream in an old fashioned churn nell
taking the part of the cream and the rifle
the dasher

  lay off cried nell what the -
do you think im made of

  gup said the man

  then sighing he moved over to another
hole and nell could see him prodding away
with a will a strangled shriek came from
that hole a cry that made every scalp
within yards draw tight and prickle the
hole erupted a man with a slicker flying
who made for the prodder but the latter
fled and the man who had shrieked did not
follow but limped about moaning and utter-
ing burning words nell recognized good-
rich

  my boil cried the poor man in answer
to some ones question he poked his --
rifle right into it i thought hed run his
bayonet through me

  it was quite light now though the mist
was heavy and nell could see something of
the nature of the ground they were in a
h

adventure

thin wood a sort of park with considerable
space between the trees and with no brush
there was much litter on the ground belts
packs rifles chaucat ammunition carriers
bandages from first aid packets-there are
two in a packet and when one is used there
is nothing to do with the other but throw it
away - tin cans that had contained hard-
tack and innumerable slickers

  the rest of the battalion were invisible but
in that particular part of the woods nell
could see his own squad sleepily rubbing
their eyes and enough other men to let him
know that a platoon was being organized

  the platoon commander was a young
man much younger even than nell but
the sergeant who was assisting him was an
old timer wifh grizzled hair they were
hurrying about inspecting ammunition belts
putting a chaucat gunner in a different
place finding a bayonet on the ground for
a man who had lost his handing out fist-
fuls of rifle ammunition to men who stuffed
their pockets with the clips and keeping up
a running fire of comment and advice the
while the officer suddenly espied nell and
came over to him

  arent you one of the replacements
he asked

  yessir said nell

  do you know how to work your rifle

  yessir

  let me see you load it

  nell did so and the officer satisfied gave
a grunt

  youd be surprized how many times we
get men that dont know how to load their
rifle he went on and thats not only bad
for them but for all of us youd think theyd
have more sense in the replacement camps
there the sergeants found a novice

the officer hurried away to
where the sergeant was giving a
short dissertation on the rifle to
one of the men who had come up
with nell the day before whether the man
was getting what was told him did not ap-
pear but the sergeant left him and hurried
to another

  the reason for such a sad state of affairs
was that this division was armed with the
model  rifle and the replacements
were invariably trained with the model
 which while not very greatly differ-
ent is exceedingly so to one not familiar
with firearms

 aint that-commented curran

  nell knew it was he for he had his brass
vase under his arm

  now these poor goops that joined yes-
terday dont know what theyre doin here
they dont know what their bayonet is for
an the best they can hope for is to stop a
bullet in some place where it wont do much
harm

  well if they stop one that might hit a
better man they done their duty said
spagett

  yeh agreed curran but most usually
the bullet goes right through em and hits
the better man just the same

  well you stay in front o me then it
wont go through both of you

  you first alphonse said curran i
got a vase i dont want spoiled by no demon
machine-gunner  

  there was a sharp blast of the whistle
and the men began to move off each squad
in single file threading among the trees

  where are we going now asked nell

  gonna eat said a man who was another
member of the squad that nell had not
heard speak before

  the squad laughed heartily and got a re-
proving look from the officer who was some
distance away and a growl from the ser-
geant who was following along behind
after that they moved in silence stepping
carefully avoiding thickets holding their
breath and waiting waiting like hunters
nearing the game

  the men all had their rifles slung this
nell noticed but he also noticed the chau-
cat gunner he had his rifle slung but its
muzzle pointed to the front and the but
was against his hip

  nell felt a slight increase in the number of
his heart beats these men were going
into action and he was going with them
he would like to dump his pack but the
sergeant was behind and would probably
make him take it up again

  rap-rap-rap - rap - rap - ra p - ra p - ra p
rap every man went down

  off packs cried the corporal the

looey forgot it or he dont give a- but

take em off now

  nell undid the hooks of his pack carrier
and thrusting his finger through the loop of
the strap that held his blanket roll to the
rest of his pack pulled it out and his blan-
ket roll and shelter half came away

  there was another rapping that swelled
a sergeant of cavalry



as it continued into a steady roar then
stopped there was a crying in the mist
like hurt children

  it aint us muttered spagett its
over on the left when they shoot at us
you can hear the bullets tickin on the trees
and the none of our guys aint hollered for
first aid

  blam babablam

  there goes the grenades called the cor-
poral over his shoulder ready now
there was a short blast of the whistle and
the men got to their feet most of them
were hooking their suspender straps into
their belts again and some had thrown
away pack blankets and all such a one
was goodrich and the corporal took him
severely to task

 youll be--good and hungry to-
night with no rations said he and belly-
achin because the guys that lugged their
packs all day wont give you none o theirs
i aint got no appetite said goodrich
my boil keeps me too amused i aint got
no mind for nothin but it anyways
therell be plenty to eat for them that can

eat it by night-huh whathe-

  here shouted the officer dont shoot
dont a man fire they didnt fire at us

here-you let them alone

  he ran forward and nells astonished eye
saw him seize a man by the scruff of the
neck and haul him back bodily then as
people sometimes blink their eyes to make
sure the vision nell rubbed his eyes to be
sure he really saw what he thought he did

  yes the vision still persisted there
was a group of men clad in gray uniforms
that made them hard to see in the fog
standing with their hands in the air there
seemed to be a lot of them but nell could
not count how many he tried several
times but each time lost track there
were almost a dozen anyway

  they stood grinning foolishly not sure
that they would not be butchered out of
hand the men seemed half inclined to
put them to the bayonet but the officer had
said no and after all these jerries had
surrendered without firing so that it was
hardly fair to kill them

nf as he went by nell saw the pit and the
reels of ammunition and the tripod the
gun was lying in the bottom of the pit not
even mounted so that it would be plain to
the advancing americans that this particu-
lar gun crew meant them no harm

  theyre licked said curran we
wont have no trouble with em now

  this aint no kind of a fight anyway
remarked spagett wheres our barrage
off in the woods about a mile like it al-
ways is said curran they cant make
me mad the farther away it is the less
chance o them dizzy artillerymen droppin
it on us

  a machine-gun buzzed under their feet
like a rattler they dived to earth and
nell thought every one must be hit the
gun chattered steadily then stopped spat
again then silence the gunners were
waiting for the men to start forward again
nell flattened himself he was not afraid
but quite excited and eager to see more of
this affair hence he hated to think he might
be hit at this early stage

  now what the men lay face down
he could see a pair of hob-nailed soles that
belonged to spagett and the hills and val-
leys of a form that must be goodrich al-
though his face was hidden behind a bush
none of them moved a muscle

  at intervals the gun scolded nell finally
began to think he could tell where it was
it was off to the right about opposite the
first squad perhaps just as he came to
this conclusion he felt a hand on his ankle

  fourth squad on your way said the
sergeants voice take em along meade
it is over to the right a little ways

  nell felt a thrill such as he remembered
when he was a recruit and was getting his
first instruction in jumping a horse you
next the corporal had said and away the
horse had taken nell to what he did not
know except that he knew it was going to
be very unpleasant not to say disagreeable

  so the squad went forward and nell with
them he saw spagett making ready a
round ball-like thing that he knew very
well was a grenade on the other side of
him crawled curran his brass vase strapped
where his blankets had been in the same
manner that a mountain-gun is strapped to
the jug-head that carries it

  these two thought nell were always
near him these two and goodrich by
accident or design undoubtedly design
they had surrounded him with old tried
campaigners as a green colt is put in a set of
fours with three veteran troop horses in
order that he may take pattern by their
calm and steady bearing whenever some-
thing new and strange startles him which


adventure

without their quieting presence might drive
him into a frenzy of fright

  and he a sergeant of cavalry did not
even know how to handle a grenade and
was not to be trusted with one lest he do
injury to his comrades

  then he saw the gun

        the boche were just ahead of
them in a shallow trench the
gun was on the parapet and the
mcn that were serving it were ly-
ing listening the gun was aimed directly at
them he could even look down the muzzle

  the gun was huge and round a large cyl-
inder with a tiny horn projecting from the
muzzle and a plug with a little chain hang-
ing from it the gunner sat on the tripod
his body invisible but his boots and gray
clad legs stuck around the side there was
a hole in one of his trouser knees

  beside the gun a man knelt looking into
the fog with an anxious expression there
was another man on the opposite side of the
gun just his head visible his nose in the air
like a dogs smelling the wind the gun-
ners knew that attempts were being made
to surround them and they hesitated to
fire lest they shoot in the wrong direction
and thus disclose their position

  nell held his breath until his ears roared
it seemed that those germans must be able
to see him why he could see their buttons
even and the breast of the mans coat rising
and falling as he breathed suddenly the
kneeling man pointed his arm darting out
like a striking snake

  the gun swung to the left and the bullets
began to climb up the belt and disappear in
the breach like a moving staircase spa-
getts arm snapped up and back but nell
did not see the grenade go spagett must
have only signaled for there was no explo-
sion an unseen german gave a sharp cry
that was drowned in a thunderclap of noise
white smoke boiled from the trench and
with a shout the squad rushed forward

  nell not knowing the tactics of silencing
machine-guns was not ready for the rush
and so was a little slower than the rest
when he arrived at the gun there was noth-
ing to be seen but a tangled heap of bodies
the machine-gun still pointing to the left
into the woods and little spirals of smoke
curling up from the shattered ground

 jump in the trench said meade
keep low till the other one gets goin

  some men rushed in from the woods and
jumped down they were the men of the
right of the company

 did they get many of yuh asked
meade

  two said the newcomers they seen
us an we couldnt duck

  well we fixed em said the corporal
get under now this aint the gun we was
after theres another one round here some-
wheres lay low till it starts wheres
the rest o the outfit

  the men in the trench listened they
could hear men moving through the woods
the faint crash of grenades and machine-
guns firing on the left

  its time we was gettin on said the
corporal of the second squad we dont
want to get left

  i tell you theres another gun around
here said corporal meade and i dont
crave to go on and leave it

  well lets buscar round a bit then

  i know a better way said meade

  here he nodded his head wisely and
winked

  gonnaturn the gun on em suggested
spagett

  nope theres too many of our guys
runnin round in this fog

  come on said the other corporal
there aint no more guns lets get on
we can wait here ten minutes said
meade or more an then catch up with the
platoon they wont go so awfulfast i
dont think well now lets wait here
and not say a word and see what happens
in five minutes lets you an me skip
rocks

  the men of the fourth squad grinned
this sort of thing was evidently a common
enough thing to them

  they sat on the parapet or strained their
eyes into the fog the men of the other
squad stayed in the trench their rifles
ready listening the two corporals began
to throw stones ahead of them into the
woods nell watched with intense curios-
ity he knew that some deep-laid plan
was afoot but what it was he did not know

  the stones were thrown a few feet beyond
the trench then a little farther and then
still farther into the woods it occurred to
nell that the sound of them striking the
ground was similar to the little sounds men
would make if they were moving very cau-
tiously through the woods
a sergeant of cavalry



  tack-tack-tackl the men on the parapet
threw themselves on the ground and began
to wriggle in the direction of the sound

  its in the trench whispered meade

  the other corporal nodded and his men
began to creep very slowly along the bottom
of the trench

  blam a wild yell and the machine-gun
barking it fired a long time almost a
minute then stopped nell heard the men
about him growling in their throats evi-
dently a rush had failed rooting out
these guns was not as easy as it might ap-
pear the fog made it difficult to tell
where the gun was by the sound of it and
it was very possible that it was not in the
trench but in front or in back of it

  meade cast a handful of stones into the
woods and was rewarded by another burst
of fire from the gun he held up his hand
for attention and then pointed over the
trench wall the men went up one by one
and nell wondered why it should be so cold
on top of the ground when it had been quite
comfortable in the trench

  the men he was with were on the back of
the trench and spagett and goodrich with
one or two others had crawled along the
opposite side or front the corporal threw
some more stones and again the gun re-
sponded this time with terrific noise it
must be under their very noses nell could
not see it but the corporal must have
been able to for he took a grenade from his
pocket and held it up so that all might see

  the others each took a grenade and as
the corporal hurled his followed his ex-
ample nell gathered his legs under him
for the rush this time he was going to be
there as soon as any of them the grenades
exploded with glorious roar much too close
for comfort for when nell leaped to his feet
he heard a piece of one buzz by his ear

  there was a man by nells side and as the
two rushed forward nell heard a sound as
though some one had struck this man with
a fist the man went down in a heap
nell heard the gun hammering and some
one crying to him to lie down a single
look around showed him men diving to
earth leaping to shelter of trees or disap-
pearing into the trench

  he got behind a tree and tried to push
himself into the ground the ground was
too hard and his gas mask in the way
when the gun fired he could hear the bul-
lets thudding into the tree

  

  this was discouraging to say the least
nell dared not move an inch the rush
had disorganized the squads so that the cor-
porals could no longer control them and
each man did as he saw fit there was a
great deal of indiscriminate grenade throw-
ing some rifle firing and occasional yelling
there was a little shoot a sucker growing
out of the tree root about two inches from
nells head when the top half of this
sucker jumped slightly and then fell to the
ground nell gave a gasp and decided to re-
treat he inched his way backward keep-
ing the tree between him and the enemy
things were too warm right there

meanwhile time was flying
the mist was beginning to burn
off and the woods were getting
lighter and hotter nell wished
he could unhook his blouse collar but he
dared not raise up enough to get at it he
began to wonder if he would get out of this
alive and how long the squad would stay
there and what there was to be done if the
machine-gun could not be captured

  then beyond the trench a way he heard a
coughing explosion a sound like a man fall-
ing down a flight of stairs and a crash as
though the supposed man had landed on a
pile of tin pans a most tremendous cloud
of smoke boiled up there was a wild yell
and men began running past him nell
jumped up and joined them

  there was a great deal of shouting cries

of heire they are the- dont that

beat- and dont gang up men dont

gang up there are other guns about

  there was a pushing crowd there men
coming in trying to see and men going away
trying to shove back the newcomers a
man with captains bars pinned to the
pocket of his blouse began to take men by
the shoulder and shove them bodily away
and corporal meade appearing he gathered
nell and the rest of his squad and led them
back the way they had come spagett and
goodrich appeared from somewhere and
curran with his vase

  you want to shake that --- thing
said the corporal  cause when the sun
comes out its goin to shine on it and give
us all away now no more talkin these
guns are gettin thick an we make noise
enough without chewin the rag

  then though nell was burning to ask
what had happened and how the gun had
i

adventure

been destroyed they went forward in si-
lence listening halting and looking care-
fully about and going forward again

  from time to time nell would hear whistles
blown two together then two more blasts
and each time the corporal would hearken
till he located the sound and several times
he changed the direction of the march

  nell decided that the whistle was the
platoons commanders and that he was
blowing it to let the squads know the proper
direction to take sometimes they heard
distant firing shouts the crashing of gre-
nades but in front of them there was no
resistance

  they captured two pallid youths with a
light machine-gun and dragged a man from
under a bush-what he was doing there was
a mystery-but except for that they saw no
enemy

  the woods grew thinner and finally ended
on the edge of a small field on the other
side of which they began again the sun
was out now and blazing cheerfully

  hold up a minute for the rest of the
gang directed the corporal we dont
want to start across this pasture all by our
lonesome there may be boche in the
farther woods

  there they go announced one of the
other men suddenly pointing to a line of
men starting out from the woods

  come on said the corporal and they
went out across the field for all the world
like a crowd of picnickers

  five steps they took and a low moan wel-
comed them a moan that became a shriek
and as every man hit the ground ended in a
short sharp explosion nell raised his head
there was a cloud of black smoke drifting
away and men getting up and moving for-
ward again

  good enough said the corporal looking
all around to see that his squad was intact
i guess theres no more machine-guns if
theyve begun to shell us

  how do you suppose they see us asked
spagett i dont see no balloon

   i can give a guess said the corporal

  he tipped his head back and shading his
eyes with his hand looked into the sky

  i thought so he muttered see
the-

  he pointed and nell could see a tiny far
away gleaming thing no larger than a bird
a bird that wheeled and dipped and circled
and hovered over them very very high

  thats a plane said the corporal to
nell hes directin the boche artillery
wont our guys drive him away asked
nell

  all laughed harshly

  let em try it said one scornfully
another shell arrived and after flopping
until it had burst the line went forward
again

  they dont hit any one said nell
the bunch all get right up again

  the guys that are hit dont said the
corporal see them stretcher bearers
he pointed to a pair of men with a long
pole-like affair over their shoulders as
nell watched these men put down their
pole and kneit in the grass

  theyre right on the job observed
nell

  oh its early in the day yet they aint
lost their courage said spagett

  i wonder would they have anything good
for a boil said goodrich ive a good
mind to ask em

  ill cure it for you said the corporal
pretending to unfix his bayonet where
is it

  uh said goodrich it aint no joke
believe me i wish you had it on the end of
your nose

  into more woods where they were de-
layed a while by some wire but the wire had
no defenders and after the stretch of wood
had been crossed the men came to a field
gleaming hot under the sun and on the far
side of the field could see a town

  a road entered the town its course
marked by telephone poles with their porce-
lain insulators glittering and when one
stepped a little to one side he could see a
second town behind the first a long blast
of the whistle and the line lay down shells
fell at irregular intervals but there was no
other firing and the white houses of the
town gleamed peacefully

  theres our meat said spagett that
town i bet were goin to take it

  if the boche dont want it grunted
the corporal but i dont guess well have
much trouble jerry dont seem to have a
whole lot of pep today

  say what happened back there in the
woods asked nell when we were held
up so long

  oh cried several at once the boche
had chicken wire over their gun

  chicken wire
a sergeant of cavalry



  yeh said the corporal they have a
big piece of chicken wire on a slant held up
by poles and when you throw a grenade at
it it bounces back the harder you throw
it the harder it bounces then when you
jump up to rush they let you have a fistful
of bullets

  gee they nailed young bottle to the
mast all right said one of the men he
stopped about six bullets

  nell looked around in astonishment
sure enough one of the men was gone the
man called bottle and there were only six
and the corporal left

  well went on the corporal wed have
been there yet only some one in the other
company got word to a trench mortar an
they come up and put the skids to em
one o them bombs is worser than a shell
it knocks everything within twenty yards
for a crape here comes the old man
hows every one fixed for reserve rations
and ammunition

  the captain accompanied by the platoon
commander was going along the line in-
inspecting the men

 every man have plenty of ammuni-
tion said he i want you corporals to
be on the job weve got a battle ahead of
us and any man that lays down ill speak to
him about it god help any one that gets
gassed or has shell shock hell wish he
was dead and no mistake you might as
well eat a meal now but dont waste any
food youll wish you had it later

the men thereupon took out
their cans of hardtack and opened
some beans which spread on the
hardtack went very well this
was breakfast and dinner combined and
they had for accompaniment the shells
bursting between them and the riverbank

  wouldnt you think theyd have brains
enough to shell the woods asked nell
they must know were in here

  thats fritz way of tellin us well be
all right if we stay where we are said the
corporal if they shelled us here it
wouldnt make no difference whether we
stayed here or went out and chased across
the field but when a guy knows that he
aint goin to get shelled in the woods he
aint too eager to run out of em and once he
gets out hell come back right priesa the first
minute he gets the chance i dont think
well have any trouble though fritz is

moving back his guns and wont have very
many to bother us with

  heres action cried spagett

  he pointed back in the woods a way
where a group of officers were standing
together

  thats the battalion p c said the
corporal every one remember where
they saw it we may need to send a runner
back some time

  theres a runner just come in to them
said spagett i bet he brought an attack
order

  thats what agreed every one there
go the company runners

  men began to run from the group to all
points of the compass forward to the as-
sault companies and back to the support
all the men began hastily to strap up their
haversacks look to their rifles and the ad-
justment of helmet and gas mask

  there was a long moment of tense wait-
ing then the soft trill of the whistle and the
line went forward at the platoon com-
manders signal they marched to the
edge of the woods they left the woods and
entered the field they proceeded through
the field

  no business said the corporal hone-
fully

  betcha theyre settin their s-s-sights
remarked curran his voice shaking ever so
slightly

  machine-guns began to mutter over on
the left the gunners in the town were
firing on the troops in that section of the
advance but in front of nells company
there was no excitement then suddenly
like the first drops of rain before a thunder
shower a few shells burst here and there

  while the smoke of them still curled
about the enemy barrage began the
shells sounded like a horse walking on a
hard pavement and they fell with about
the same speed and regularity as the sup-
posed horse would put down his feet one
after the other nell noticed that the men
were not lying down for the shells now 

  indeed if they did they would spend all
their time lying down and getting up and
would have none left for the advance nell
kept his eyes straight to the front and kept
his feet moving

  when he heard a man cry out he did not
look to see what had happened to him
when a fountain of dirt and smoke leaped
up in front of him and the dust of it nearly


adventure

blinded him he kept right on going while
he cleared his eyes he watched the cor-
poral all the time

  if im ever going to get my opportu-
nity said nell to himself itll be sudden
like all opportunities are im thankful
im a cavalryman theyre trained to recog-
nize the right instant to seize a chance and
turn it to a glorious victory and if my
chance comes i want to have some idea
how these doughboys fight id look fat
giving them fours right and prepare to
fight on foot 

  the advance crossed the road they had
noticed before they left the woods and
took shelter in a ravine on the far side
the men of the fourth squad lay pant-
ing on the grass and muttered to them-
selves curran bound up a puttee that
had come loose

  where the-s our artillery said he

takin a day off i aint heard a shell go
all day

  theyre doin their stuff said good-
rich see up on that hill there

  he pointed to a hill beyond the farthest
town where white clouds told of bursting
shells the nearest town was almost di-
rectly to their left now a mass of white
buildings surrounded by a sort of thin
haze from time to time white smoke
would float over the roofs or gush from
the windows of a house in the fields
before the town nell could see men
running advancing lying down and then
retreating

  theres machine-guns in there said
spagett theyre givin the second battal-
ion - if the attack keeps on we wont

get no notice from there but if that bat-
talion quits and falls back to reorganize oh
man theyll run us outta these fields like
kids out of a orchard

  the advance began again by squads the
old fashioned squad-rush one after the
other the squads jumped to their feet and
ran forward a little way then lay down

  now then said the corporal every-
body get set come on

  they stood up and went forward nell
heard a clank and curran cried out nell
looked and saw the other man come to a halt
and try to tie himself in a knot

  come on cried the corporal this is

no place to match pennies what the-

you stoppin for

  they socked one through my vase

panted curran running forward again

  the corporal laughed heartily and when
the squad had come up on the line and laid
down the men rolled with laughter

  it aint no - joke said curran

hey can you see where it went

  he appealed to nell who turning over
examined the vase the bullet had gone
through the base making a round hole and
had come out the top without further
damage

  it isnt hurt much said nell the
hole is in the bottom youd never know
it was there when you set the vase on end

  well thats cheerin said curran

  i dont know why were advancin this
way commented the corporal there
aint much fire here maybe the rest of the
line is gettin it well here we go again
come on

  after the second rush the word was
passed along to change direction the next
rush brought the men across a narrow gage
railroad and found them facing the nearest
town there was a marsh within a few
yards of them that betokened the presence
of a river they could also see the ruins of
a bridge between the two towns

  faint yelling on the left betokened the
beginning of the assault of the nearest town
and during the next rush of the squad nell
could see americans running about in the
streets

  the noise of the battle increased tenfold
as if the enemy snarled in rage at the loss
of the town machine-gun fire opened
upon the men from the heights beyond
the farthest town artillery redoubled its
activity and great things like pigs be-
gan to sail through the air and fall with
deafening explosions that drowned all other
sound

  minnies an machine-guns muttered
the men and began to look questioningly at
the corporal

  dont get excited said he they wont
leave us here very long

  he was right for it was but a minute
before the word came down the line to
fall back to the shelter of the railroad
track and this the men did with astonish-
ing celerity

  now i suppose said goodrich we dig
in they couldnt have picked a better
place for it all the boche have to do is to
shoot at the railroad track and they know
theyll hit us
a sergeant of cavalry



y  the man beside nell gave a dry
v m cougb and rolled upon his side
tien roed back again good-
rich who was on the other side of
the man that had coughed looked at him
intently

  this guys hit said goodrich he
rolled the other man on his back hes
dead too that leaves six of us two new
guys and the four old-timers

  see that town across the river said
the corporal to cause a diversion dont
look now for --s sake youll get one
through your skull but look the next time
you get a chance well thats the nut
weve got to crack there wont be no
counter attack cause of the river when
we get across that brook watch out for a
hot time

  farther down the track some men were
trying to dig in but so many were hit that
the attempt was given up

  i hope we dont stay here long con-
tinuedthe corporal if we should get the
order to fall back to the woods i wouldnt
be a bit disappointed then we could
come out again after dark this is fierce
we cant even get a chance to dig a hole
well what are we waiting for cried
nell after a long time

  the inaction was getting on his nerves
it was not so bad to advance even if the
fire was hot for he was moving getting
down and getting up and the physical effort
required helped to keep his mind from the
danger but while he lay on the ground and
heard the shells strike and the machine-gun
hammering and the men calling he began
to feel his courage weaken

  dont get in a sweat advised good-
rich well do our stuff soon enough
were waitin while theartillery shells some
of those boche guns and those minnies up
on the hill there then when we move out
the goin wont be so rough

  then in response to some signal that
nell did not see the corporal retired like a
crab backward and went out of sight

  non-coms front and center suggested
spagett now well have some fun
when the corporal returned the expres-
sion of his face betokened anything but fun

  this platoons going over as a patrol
said he advance by individuals proceed
at the whistle the general attack wont
be made until tomorrow because the en-
gineers have got to put up a bridge now

then curran take off that - piece of

brass pipe because they can see you going
through the reeds with it and youll be
killed now take it off

  this being a direct order and disobedi-
ence to it a serious thing curran took off the
vase then he inspected his gas mask ad-
justed his belt and made ready

  go ahead said the corporal good-
rich you follow him in three minutes ill
give you the word

  im glad that boil o mine is in back and
not in front said goodrich

  some boche may save yuh the trouble of
havin it cut laughed spagett

  thats right agreed the other
thatll be a comfortin thought every time
i cross a open space

  goodrich got away into the marsh and
the corporal turned to nell you new
man there-er-colburn youre next
when the corporal nodded looking up
from his wrist watch nell taking his bear-
ings from the church steeple in a town to
the left rear slid over the railroad track
and into the marsh it was a lot like diving
into cold water the worst of it was getting
in after he had begun to crawl he had no
apprehension only a lively interest as to
what it was going to be like across the river

  this scouting said nell to himself
is something i can understand i may not
savvy very much about taking machine-
guns but when it comes to making a recon-
naissance or knocking over a few with the
rifle i wont stand back for any of em

  he got through the marsh without any
more excitement than a bath of mud when a
shell burst within a yard of him and came
out on the riverbank where the rushes were
very high and where the pitch of the op-
posite bank protected him both from ob-
servation and fire

  he could see down the river here to
where soldiers were crossing on the frag-
ments of the old bridge they crept along
swinging under the arches jumping from
one junk of shattered masonry to the other
some wading waist deep and when they had
reached the far bank they crawled up and
disappeared over the edge as well as
nell could see the crossing was not being
opposed up river was a sharp bend

  now said nell ive crossed a few
rivers in my time and i dont think theyre
much different here than they are in mexico
ill bet theres a ford below that bend


adventure

  he crawled up the rushes a way though
it was terribly hot and the rushes like so
many knives slashing at his face and when
he sounded cautiously with his leg he
found a ford sure enough there must be a
bar there going diagonally across to the far
bank it was not very wide though and it
petered out a little when it got to the other
bank but it was a good place to know about
and nell tied a strip of bandana handker-
chief to a bunch of rushes so that he could
find the ford again if he were returning in a
hurry

  if he had been a more experienced soldier
that is more experienced fighting machine-
guns he would have looked very carefully
for strings or wires near that ford that
would give the alarm to guarding machine
guns but he did not look for them and
even when he saw a piece of broken string
floating in the current on the far side of the
ford he thought nothing of it

  when nell came under the shelter of the
other bank he removed his helmet put his
arm through the chin strap and unslung
his rifle

  now then forward the light brigade
said he and gritting his teeth and pushing
his rifle ahead of him he eased his way
slowly into the rushes and as the ground be-
came firmer and rose higher he bent lower
and lower until he crept along on his
stomach

  he was in a field of uncut wheat here
nearly breast high he passed a lane a
place in the wheat where some one had cut
a swathe seemingly clear through the field
it went nearly a hundred yards in one direc-
tion and in the other ended at the riverbank

 now what the - is that for

thought nell it must be a path for those
squareheads to go down to the bank and
back on

the path was a fire lane cut by
the boche for their machine-guns
and so constructed that a man
crossing it at night a man or a
rat even would be silhouetted against the
sky at the far end and the wary gunners at
the other end could make a sieve out of him

  the former cavalryman however went
unscathed he began to grow confident
and to forget that he was on a very danger-
ous mission the wheat was thick and he
could not see the death that was all around
him suddenly he came upon a place

where another man had crushed the wheat
down as he crawled

 aha the hunter hunted who had
done it german or yank nell would
discover he listened no sound of move-
ment or of breath he drew one knee under
him and straightened it no sound again
he drew up his knee and shoved his body
forward silence he rolled upon his
stomach and stiffened as if an electric cur-
rent had passed through him

  a boche his brain howled a boche

  outwardly he held his breath

  in front of him scarcely four yards away
he could see through the stalks of wheat
the broken outline of a man the man was
clad in gray a dirty gray that was almost
black he lay on his stomach his feet out
of sight in the wheat on one side and his
head out of sight in the other he must
have been the man who had made the track
that nell was following

  nell hesitated to attack this man he
might give away the fact that there were
americans in the wheat in addition this
boche might be the point of an advance
guard or a flanker for a company on the
other hand it would not be wise to leave
him unmolested to go back and report

  if he was a connecting file a flanker or a
scout the battle would be on but that was
a chance that nell must take he began
to crawl dragging himself with his elbows
closer and closer to the german

  it was five yards to where the german lay
and nell proceeded at the rate of a yard a
minute he could swear however that it
took him an hour to get close enough to the
boche to see the barrel of a light machine
gun nell thereupon estimated the situa-
tion as the books say he had a yard to
go the boche was facing away from him
his head resting on his arm squinting along
the barrel of his gun nell could rush the
last yard and bayonet the other man before
he could have time to swing the gun about
to bear on nell

  here without waiting for command from
nells brain his legs gave him a tremendous
heave forward his bayonet flashed in the
sun and zipped into the ground under the
germans arm as clean a miss as ever red
flag waved for nell felt as if a bucket of
ice water had been dumped over him and
letting go his rifle and still moving with the
momentum of his rush he leaped upon the
germans back and seized the other about
a sergeant of cavalry



the throat with every ounce of strength that
he could muster

  hey said a voice git offa him

i	killed him five minutes ago

  a wrathful face peered from the wheat
a lean hard face with high cheek bones and
lantern jaw a face surmounted with a steel
helmet of american design nell got off
he realized the german was dead the in-
stant his hands had seized his throat
without a word nell wiped his hands on the
germans blouse very carefully finger by
finger recovered his rifle and joined the
man in the wheat

  what the- dyuh mean makin all

that noise whispered the other man

  how would i know he was dead re-
plied nell did you expect me to ask
him

  the other man grunted scornfully
swiftly he flattened himself on the ground
all but his head but he kept his face up and
resting his chin on the ground scowled very
fiercely straight to the front nell followed
his example he could hear a number of
men coming toward them through the
wheat the newcomers came cautiously
along the sound of them showing that they
were moving very slowly on hands and
knees

  nell noticed that the other man had no
rifle but held a long triangular knife with a
very large guard in one hand and a bomb
in the other nell looked at the blade of
the knife and then looked rapidly away
again he clenched his fists and ground his
teeth one upon the other but in vain

  war is tough on the stomach in more ways
than one and the sight of a knife blade still
smoking from a jugular vein is liable to up-
set the strongest when nell was himself
again he shook the tears from his eyes and
prepared to do battle the hard-boiled
man with him glared at him with naked
teeth

  - he hissed

  there was silence in the wheat the
other men had heard and halted there
was a thud and nells startled eye beheld a
black pear-shaped object just under his
nose a thing of metal cut into many tiny
squares the thing sizzled like a boiling
kettle a hand licked out and the bomb
was gone bong it exploded some dis-
tance away and stones and little bits of
wheat stalk rained down on nell and the
hard-boiled man

  come on said the hard-boiled man in a
low voice were a couple of yanks and
he gave the name of his company com-
mander

  the wheat parted and lo appeared
corporal meade with spagett goodrich
curran the platoon commander non-com-
missioned officers and soldiers they spoke
profanely

  what are you doing here asked the
corporal

  i came across at a ford said nell and
came right along

  you certainly went fast said the lieu-
tenant id advise you not to make so
much noise we thought you were boche
and threw a bomb at you we had no
idea youd be up here so soon we didnt
know there was any one in front of us
come no more talking lets get where
we can see something the wheat ends
pretty soon

  then he led the way forward about ten
yards where the wheat stopped at a low
belt of barbed wire they all lay down
while the officer reconnoitered

  nell could see through the stalks of
wheat green hills striped with yellow and
bands of darker green sweeping up to the
sky in the distance lower down a row
of poplars marked a road the road itself
hidden by a railroad embankment the
town was on the left half hidden by
trees but with the outlying houses painly
visible

  nell noticed how silent and peaceful
everything looked it did not seem pos-
sible that there was a fight going on yet
the distant heights were wreathed in smoke
from the bursting shells and the houses of
the town shone through a faint haze a sort
of blur like the heat waves that rise in
front of a mans sights on the target range
machine-guns were doing their duty there
and doing it nobly

  heads up whispered the returning
lieutenant i think we can make it to
that railroad track there doesnt seem
to be any one in the fields the firing
in the town is all on the men trying to
cross up there i think we would have
been fired on before now if there was any-
thing stirring here now well cross the
field by twos at intervals of about ten
yards ill lead this wire out here isnt
very thick and we can get through it all
right ive cut a lane


adventure

away went the lieutenant and
after him two more the pla-
toon sergeant timed the advanc-
ing men and sent out the next
two men when he thought proper

  these guys arent so wise after all
thought nell if they were sent to re-
connoiter the north bank then theyve gone
too far inland and if they were sent to
get contact with the enemy the patrol is too
weak that looey is going to keep on until
he gets himself into trouble

  nell looked about him for a way of re-
treat in case of need the wheat was no
place to go for though it shielded a man
from observation it would not protect him
from gun-fire and a little sweeping from
machine-guns would dispose of all the men
hiding in it

  it was nells turn to go before he had
made up his mind what to do he had
joined his squad and found himself beside
spagett neither spoke to the other but
crept across the field fheir faces were
strained and their eyes fixed on the railroad
track as a man swimming and not very sure
of reaching the shore keeps his eyes on the
beach

  nell kept wondering what he could do in
case of accident he had come up to the
front for a distinct purpose but that pur-
pose was not to get himself killed at last
they reached the railroad embankment and
turning about in its shelter they could lay
on their backs agaust it and look back at
their own lines while they waited for the rest
of the men to cross the wheat the far
bank of the river seemed a long way off

  corporal said the lieutenant skip
over the track and see whats on the other
side we might as well be doing some-
thing while were waiting for the rest of the
men

  the corporal got up and crouching as low
as he could climbed the railroad bank
nells roving eye discovered an arch of
smoke-stained granite that was built into
the side of the embankment

  me for that place he thought when
the fun begins

  there was a scurrying sound from the
top of the embankment and a piece of bal-
last rolled down clattering the corporal
appeared with white face and bulging eyes

  hey he cried the whole german
armys on the other side o this thing an
cornin like ---

  the men leaped to their feet but before
the officer could utter a word a mass of
men poured over the track like a wave over
a sandbar the germans looked like a lot
at first sight like a young army but when
the americans leaped to their feet and be-
gan shooting they discovered that there
were not so many after all

  the germans were considerably taken
aback at seeing so many of their enemies
and almost before the fight started it was
over the germans going back across the
track and the americans being pulled down
off the bank by the officer nell had not
fired a shot

  come on cried the officer theyll be
back with their friends in a minute lets be
going now what the-

  in the field the men who had been crawl-
ing when the tight started had leaped to
their feet to come to their comrades assis-
tance several of them lay plainly in view
but in that tossed-away all-in-a-heap atti-
tude that means but one thing

 who the - done that muttered

the men

  two more men out in the field leaped to
their feet and made a dash for the wheat
they threw themselves to earth after run-
ning a short distance but did not get up
again and the americans under the rail-
road could see that they were motionless

  look at the wheat said nell

  the wheat swayed and rippled as if it
bowed before a strong breeze but there was
no breeze in that hot lifeless air nell lis-
tened the clatter of machine-guns was
clear and distinct they were searching
that wheat and when they got through
there would not be so much as a field mouse
alive in all that sector of river bank

  a stick bomb a german contraption that
looks like a potato masher clattered down
the stones of the embankment the officer
seized it and tossed it back none too soon
for it exploded in air and one of the yanks
was hit by the fragments

  i say over there called a voice with a
very british accent youd better surren-
der you know or well make proper giblets
out of you

  come on over and try it called the
lieutenant

  he hurled a bomb straight into the air as
high as he could

  they wont throw that back he cried

  the bomb rushed back to earth on the
a sergeant of cavalry



other side of the track and by the sound
exploded about a foot above the ground

  everybody cried the officer let em
have it

  over the bombs went the sound of them
like a young barrage

  now then shouted the officer every
man for himself into the ditch and follow
it to the river

  there was a ditch that ran from the cul-
vert nell had noticed down to the wheat
where it disappeared it was a very shal-
low one and nell wondered why he had not
crossed it in the wheat perhaps it turned
in a different direction when it got out of
sight

  nell had hesitated a few seconds to get
his bearings and so was a little behind the
others as they rushed for the shelter of the
ditch machine-guns cackled excitedly and
the men began to drop

  the officer was hit he went to his knees
and nell saw the bullets whip through his
blouse as he used to watch them make
holes in a paper target when he was marking
in the butts the men began to throw away
their rifles

  here cut that out roared corporal
meade keep your heads into the ditch

  the men heard and blindly turned for
the ditch into which they dived pht
went the bullets into them some lay
still others got up and tried to get out
again some cried a warning and died
with it on their lips

  corporal meade seized spagetts hand
and tried to drag him to safety but the bul-
lets found them both

  that sight maddened nell colburn he
knew nothing about infantry but he knew
a good deal about panic and he knew some-
thing about leading men

  lie down he roared theyre firing
along the ditch lie down in the field

  a bullet nearly tore his gas mask from
his neck and he lay down himself

  keep your heads men cried nell
lie still and dont move theyve got
us cold if we stay here till dark we can
get away

  he repeated this as loud as he could
several times the men must have heard
for they all lay as they were without mov-
ing

  dont try to crawl around ordered
nell they can see us from the hills
dont move a muscle

the guns fired and fired those
in the wheat would pound away
for a long time then they would
stop and the gun that was shoot-
ing down the ditch would carry on alone
this one had a very loud ringing sound a
peculiar clanging that the others did not
have nell decided that it must be a dif-
ferent type

  he looked at the blue sky and the fleecy
clouds and wondered how long they would
last would he ever be back on the other
side of the river again well at least he
would try and give the jerries a run for
their money before they killed him

  whatever happened he was not going to
let himself be shot like a rabbit when
dark came a man ought to be able to get to
the ford what wise birds these boche
were they must have had their eyes on
the patrol the minute it left the other bank
and they had allowed it to get far inland
too far to get back again intending per-
haps to take the whole lot prisoners

  they must have miscalculated the num-
ber or they would have sent more men out
to do the capturing and when the men
had made their dash for the ditch the ma-
chine-gunners must have lost their heads
and let go with all they had perhaps they
had fired so savagely to be certain that no
yank would go back with information or
so to destroy the courage of the americans
that the survivors would surrender without
further resistance

  suddenly the firing stopped from the
direction of the railroad track came a faint
calling but perfectly audible

  come on in americans come in we
wont hurt you

  there was no answer from the field

  come on called the far-away voice
dont you ever want to go home again
youll be killed if you stay out there

  the machine-guns began again the bul-
lets whining and cracking overhead a
minenwerfer began to throw rum-jars
about nell could not tell by the sound
where they were going although he knew
they must be very near the sun beat
down unmercifully nell knew the men
must be suffering from thirst for he cer-
tainly was but he dared not try to get at
his canteen

  at intervals the man on the railroad track
called to them to come in once late in
the afternoon a minenwerfer bomb landed


adventure

very close among the stones and dirt and
bits of sod that rained down after the ex-
plosion were little pieces of equipment and
a big chunk of od blouse that fluttered
down like a falling leaf

  oh oh americans sang the man on
the track youd better come in come
in and have a cold bottle of beer weve got
lots of it

  one of the men in the field began to cry
and there was a slight stir as of others
getting to their feet

  lie down barked nell the first
man that gets up gets a slug of lead through
his skull

  he meant it too and after that they
made no more moves the man on the
track gave it up after a while and took his
haunting voice elsewhere the afternoon
dragged it seemed weeks long nell could
hear men sighing from time to time and soft
muttering so that he knew there were some
still left alive

  he cursed the summer twilight but it
grew dark in the valley sooner than he ex-
pected for the sun went behind the hills
and a mist began to rise from the river

  now muttered nell to himself if we
dont get kettled we ought to be able to get
out of this place

  all afternoon he had been thinking of
plans for escape trying to remember his
progress from the river where the ford was
what signs of the enemy he had seen in the
wheat he remembered the fire lane and
guessed what it was and he was sure that
the ditch turned and went into the river
above his ford so that if he could once get
to the river end of the ditch he had but to
work downstream and he would find the
ford the first thing to do therefore was
to silence the machine-gun that commanded
the ditch and nell could give a good guess
where it was he felt that he should wait
until the night was darker but his impa-
tience was too great it was impossible to
remain inactive any longer

  what do you say gang called nell in
a low voice are you with me

  there were faint mutters of assent

  make for the railroad said nell the
machine-gun thats firing down the ditch is
in a culvert there if we can get it we can
go down the ditch to the river and get back
all right come on now take it slow

  nell began to crawl back across the field
he heard a man scraping along the ground

beside him and was tempted to speak to
him but thought better of it machine-
guns were rattling with great vigor and al-
though none seemed to be very near there
was a possibility that there might be some
within hearing distance the other man
chuckled happily nell stopped in aston-
ishment and the man gurgled again with
every indication of delight

  whos there whispered nell throwing
caution to the winds

  goodrich said the other man

  whats the grand joke

  oh kid chuckled goodrich my
boil has bursted i feel like i could lick the
whole german army

  youll probably get a chance to try
said nell

  in the shelter of the railroad the men
counted noses it was dark there and their
forms would be invisible against the back-
ground of rock ballast seven men nell
goodrich curran the hard-boiled man
who had knifed the machine-gunner in the
wheat and three others one of whom was
wounded in the arm

  they waited quite a while in case any
more should come in but no one came and
at last nell gathered the men with heads
close together and opened a counsel of war
the men accepted his leadership without
question their main idea was to get back
alive and any one who showed any signs of
ability to get them there was leader enough
for them regardless of his rank

suddenly as if by pre-
arrangement the ground between
the track and the river was
brilliantly lighted nells first
thought was searchlight but as he lay
hurriedly down on his back he could see
that the sky was filled with hanging lights
dazzling white floating steadily and sending
out little streamers of smoke

  its lucky we came when we did
thought nell

  one by one the lights died others took
their place but farther down the river and
some were fired from the far side of the track
that lighted the field but left the embank-
ment in deep shadow

  come on now cried nell while its
dark

  theres some o those-right around

here husked a voice

  in the culvert said nell notasound
a sergeant of cavalry



  a machine-gun roared into action at their
very elbows there was no time to give
directions nor could they have been heard
if they had been nell scrambled up the
embankment and crawled along its side the
barking of the gun drowning the noise of his
feet and the stones rattling down

  he began to fear that he would pass the
culvert in the darkness when a light was
fired and he flattened himself against the
stones praying that they would not roll
both him and themselves to the bottom of
the bank as it happened he lay with his
face down hill so that from one eye he could
see the other men at the foot of the bank in
single file flat on their faces motionless as
the dead

  he was alone on the embankment and
would have to do his work singlehanded
darkness again but nell had no sooner
gathered his legs under him than another
cluster of lights blazed and he was forced
to lie down again his position however
was changed slightly so that he could see
out over the field out to the wheat where
shells were bursting

  midway between scattered on the field
were the bodies of the men who had been
killed in the afternoon then nell saw the
far end of the ditch its course marked by a
black line of shadow his eye rapidly fol-
lowed this to where it went out from under
the embankment man there was a gun
there he could see it plainly with a man
beside it and another just at the edge of the
bank kneeling and looking toward the
americans

  as nell watched this man bent hurriedly
down and seized the shoulder of the man
by the gun he shook it and pointed to the
americans the other man jumped up and
bending over the gun picked it up clumsily
and swung it up on the edge of the ditch
the lights went out as though a switch had
been turned

  nell decided two things that the men
with the gun would fire another light and
then begin shooting and that when the
light went up he would make two jumps
and either silence the gun or be killed with
the rest of them

  bang went the pistol pop the lights
gleamed brightly nell made a leap for
the culvert edge landed on his feet crouch-
ing and swaying forward took a second
leap just as the gun gave its first bark he
landed squarely on the shoulders of the

kneeling german knocked him over across
the gun and nell gun and germans went
backward into the ditch with nell still
holding the others collar in a death grip

  the man squirmed and writhed his
body heaved under the yanks knees his
hands tore at the yanks clothes his nails
scratched at the yanks face but nell hung
on a flying body struck him in the back
and knocked him forward on to his antag-
onist a foot crunched against one of his
hands something struck him over the head
and nearly knocked him senseless mean-
while he hung to his german

  he had the others coat collar twisted in
his hands and he had his thumbs into the
germans neck as far as he could shove
them he intended to hang on until he was
killed and something told him that he had
a good leverage on the other for the mans
struggles grew perceptibly weaker there
was grunting splashing and thrashing
bodies all about but nell did not hear them

  a light went up and its glare shone full
into the ditch but nell paid no heed he
saw a mans head under his hands and the
back of a blouse and a shoulder strap with
 on it when the light went out the
german had ceased to struggle

  nell got very stiffly to his feet another
light lightened the field and across it two
germans their coat tails right out straight
were taking their hurried way some one
grunted and hurled a bomb after them it
burst and the two running men gave a little
jump as moving picture comedians do when
a pistol is fired at them but kept on
running

  then they must have been seen from the
farther bank for one of them dropped got
up again ran a few feet and then went
down for good and his companion did what
looked like an attempt at a handspring and
lay still nell was forced to laugh

  the crawling over the stones and the
holding of breath when the lights went up
and his bitter fight with the german had
all ended happily and there were the two
jerries running away with a hop skip and
jump as fast as they could he laughed
heartily and his chuckles were echoed from
the ditch

  theres one o them huns under my foot
as dead as a herrin whispered some one

  see has he got on a gott mit uns belt
cried another

  there was a scramble in the dark alas


adventure

neither the man nell had fought with nor
the other dead man had on a belt

  where did you birds come from asked
nell

  we heard the scrap said the hard-
boiled man in his rasping voice an we
wasnt agreeable you should hog it all your-
self so we come a-gallopin

  well lets get down and see what this
culvert looks like said nell we may
have to spend the night in it anyway
weve got a gun to knock over a few with if
they try to get rough with us

         the culvert was more properly a
bridge there was a tiny stream
in the bottom of the ditch as they
found by feeling around in the
bottom of it to locate the dead germans
nell knew how he had killed his man now
he had held his head under water

  the arch of the culvert went under the em-
bankment into a hole of darkness it was
solidly built of granite blocks and with the
railroad over it would stop anything it was
doubtful if a naval gun could cave it in no
wonder the boche gunners had picked on it
for a place to spend the night in

  the other end o this is in germany
spoke up some one

  thats right agreed two or three
maybe them bochell send a relief through
or somethin

  well where do you suppose it goes
muttered nell i cant see anything at
all youd think you could see the sky
through the other end

  a light went up from the far side of the
track but though it lighted the field and the
embankment and shone into the bottom of
the ditch it did not illumine the darkness of
the culvert

  theres a bend in it thats what de-
cided nell thats why we cant see
through it maybe it doesnt go through to
the other side even

  captain rasped the hard-boiled man
lets me an you go see where it goes
ill go you said nell somebody give
me a knife

  unfortunately the hard-boiled man had
the only trench knife in the crowd and he
wanted it himself most of the men had
left their rifles by the embankment or in the
field nell had forgotten where he had left
his but one man still had his and tendered
nell the bayonet

  ill go first said the hard-boiled man
it was my plan in the first place now
dont ram that bayonet up my neck a mile
if i stop quick

  dont you guys monkey with that gun
while im gone either directed nell

  then he and the hard-boiled man got
down and began to crawl into the culvert

  inside there it was cold and damp and
when a hobnail rapped a stone the sound
rang tremendously the arch was high
enough to sit upright but not to stand and
while two men could lie abreast in it with
room to spare they could not crawl that
way so the hard-boiled man led and nell
after him it was black as a pocket they
crawled and crawled and suddenly nell
bumped something soft with his head

  shhshsh whispered the hard-boiled
man in his ear have them lunkheads fol-
lered us

  nell looked back the mouth of the cul-
vert was perfectly discernable a square of
dark blue against a frame of deep black
across the bottom of the square were knobs
and projections these were the heads of
the men in the ditch who were kneeling and
staring down the culvert nell counted
carefully there were five hats there

  no he replied theyre all where we
left em

  then were goin to have callers said
the hard-boiled man listen

  there was a scraping sound in the culvert
that became more clearly audible with
every second the sound could mean but
one thing men were crawling from the
other end of the culvert

  get against the wall whispered nell
shoving the other man to one side

  if the boche came around the turn they
would keep to the nearest wall that is
turning to the left they would instinctively
stick close to that wall and nell had a hunch
that that was the way the bend turned if
he had guessed wrong then it only meant
that the contact would be head on nell
tightened his muscles he heard a man
breathing

  the man grunted and said something in
his natural voice he was crawling along
the right wall and nell let drive with the
bayonet as hard as he could the man
yelled deafeningly nell sought and found
the others mouth and clamped a hand over
it then he shifted his grip to the others
windpipe and tried to get back his bayonet
a sergeant of cavalry



but it would not respond to his wild tugs
then instinct told him the man would not
make any more noise and he released his
throat

  come on cried the hard-boiled man
the rest of em got away lets get after
them

  nell began to crawl furiously the
bend in the culvert was very near and after
he turned he could see light at the other
end and backs rippling as men crawled
along at their best speed the stones tore
ais knees and his hands were badly skinned
on the side of the culvert but he kept
on and in a few seconds was in the open
listening to pounding feet the germans
and the hard-boiled man had got out first
and had gone into the darkness

  nell looked about him like the famous
bear to see what he could see and also
like the famous bear he could see nothing
but the other side of the track there
was a black field in front of him that
might be crisscrossed with trenches or in
which a regiment of the enemy might be
bivouacking

  he could hear shells socking somewhere
in the distance and see the ghostly foun-
tains of smoke that leaped into air after
the explosion he moved along the base
of the embankment a few steps but
halted suddenly as he saw a number of
black shadows before him the shadows
were motionless and after looking for them
for a few seconds nell could see that they
were knapsacks twisted overcoats and a
blanket or two

  a little further on were some square holes
where a man might take refuge in the event
of shells coming too close nell thought
that the holes were a waste of labor since
the railroad track would be sufficient defil-
de for any projectile but nell was not
acquainted with trench mortars that are
designed for the attack of defiladed areas
and that can throw a demijohn of high ex-
plosive up into the air and down again so
close that its own crew are likely to become
casualties from the burst

  psst went some one in the dark

  nell flattened himself against the em-
bankment gripping his bayonet

  capn a hoarse whisper

  nell let a rock roll down the bank clicking
against its fellows and in a few seconds the
hard-boiled man took shape from the
darkness

  where did you go asked nell

  i was chasin that guy i dont want
for to have him go an get his gang an come
back an clean up on us

the bursting of a light on the
other side of the track interrupt-
ed it was well away and the
shadow of the bank covered them
the light showed them a field a narrow
cart track crossing it and the shattered
poplars of a high-road

  the stream that flowed in the bottom of
the ditch came down through the field to
their right at an angle and it was because
of this bend in the stream that the culvert
had the elbow in it the course of it was
almost parallel to the embankment wel-
come darkness again

  how did you make out continued nell
i got me one o them gott mit uns belts
said the hard-boiled man i been tryin to
get one for a week

  well said nell we better be goin
back while its dark one o those lights
might flash on us any time

  there seems to be more racket goin on
than before doesnt there

  nell listened shells were growling stead-
ily on the other side of the embankment and
on the distant road every so often he could
hear one go rustling by overhead probably
on its way to the german artillery position
on the heights above the town

  maybe our artillery has snapped out
of it suggested nell well anyway
lets go back an see whats going on with
the gang

  they started to go back to the entrance
to the culvert but somebody began to beat
upon a tin pan with a stick this was a
new sound to both but they lay down just
the same until it was over there was no
use being able to identify a sound by the
feel of its projectiles in ones anatomy

  nell however decided what had made
the racket it was a machine-gun firing in-
side the culvert with its muzzle pointing in
it meant one of two things either the yanks
were trying to work the thing and it had
gone off while they were examining it or
the party had been captured or killed by
the enemy and the boche were shooting
into the culvert to be sure that there were
no more yanks in there the bullets of
course could not come around the bend
but the sound could


adventure

  i guess we wont go back that way
said nell the gun stopped firing after a
minute or two but that was no sign that it
wasnt there any longer and ready to fire
again at the slightest sound

  whats the mad rush to get back
asked the hard-boiled man were just
as safe here as we are there were safer
we aint gettin any fire here from either
side and on the other side the track both the
jerries and our own guys are lettin fly
were goin to get perforated anyway but
theres no hurry about it

  no i want to see whats goin on said
nell the main object of this here war
party is to take seven whole skins back
across the river and if theres a way to do
it its goin to be done an that way
wont be found by stickin around here
lead the way capn said the other
over the top we go said nell and be-
gan to scramble up the embankment

  he forgot entirely that there were men
with ears all around him nor did it occur
to him that if a light went up just as he
reached the track that his light would be
extinguished and that with most astonish-
ing rapidity

  hey panted the other man wait a
minute theres a train cornin

  a train a train on this track that had
borne no traffic since spring by golly
there was one coming at that the boche
must have an armored train running the
two men crouched on the stones the rails
hummed and sang and nell could hear the
rattling of the wheels he cautiously
lifted his head there was a line of sparks
along the rails a glittering line of fire that
stretched clear down around the curve

  nell ducked and waited for the train to
go by the sound continued but no train
appeared nor did the rattle and song of the
rails grow in volume as it would if wheels
were making it a hand plucked at nells
coat

  lets get outta here cried the hard-
boiled man at the top of his voice the words
however only barely audible come on
offa here theres a machine-gun barrage
goin on this track

  nell went to the bottom of the embank-
ment in one jump train indeed the
yanks must be putting down the barrage
for if it had come from nells side of the
track he would never have got as far up the
bank as he had

  no wonder it sounded like a train there
were perhaps thirty or forty machine-guns
firing and each one doing better than a
hundred shots a minute the bullets were
rattling against the rails and striking sparks
from them the two men went down and
sat wordlessly in the shadow of the bank

  lets have a listen at the culvert again
suggested the hard-boiled man after a
while

  there being no objection to that they
crawled to where the culvert opened and
harkened

 - they both gasped theres

guys cornin through

  hark said nell theyre talkin
there was the familiar scraping sound of
crawling men and muttering of voices the
two craned their necks into the ditch and
then the voices were audible so close that
it seemed the men must be at the very en-
trance of the culvert

  i tell yuh its mine said a voice in the
culvert

  like so much pig bristles scoffed an-
other i found it didnt i

  aw grapenuts

  no grapenuts neither who killed that
jerry anyways

  go on go on cried several fcr

-s sake git goin never mind the a rgu-

ment move yourself

  the scratching sounds began again and
five shadows emerged from the culvert

  this is as far as i go remarked a voice
if them two aint no more sense than to go
curvin off through the whole boche arm
they oughta be captured

this nights so black it would make a
nigger look like a snow man said another
here nell thought best to say a word

 what the - do you men mean by

leaving your post he asked

  there was the sound of five men doing
their best to jump right out of their skins
is that you they gasped we
thought the boche got yuh

  well if they hadnt said nell you
birds would have only the culvert had a
crook in it waddyuh mean lettin that gun
go down the alley that way

  oh man said goodrich there was
six big krauts come along the ditch an we
staggered outa there they all ducked into
the tunnel so we hauls the gun off the
bank an turned it down the hole after em
but none of us knew how to work it so
a sergeant of cavalry

i

while we was monkeyin with it the krauts
heard us an they was cornin back to see
how come only the gun went off and stitch-
ed a couple o seams in em

  so then we come through with the gun
said another man its too hot over on
that side theres more iron flyin around
than if it was rainin hardware stores
hsstl went some one in the darkness
instant silence nell listened to the
blood pounding in his ears

  now what he thought if it isnt
one thing in this war its six

  hsst went the mysterious man again
come over here i found some chow

the pile of blankets and over-
coats about the holes under the
bank marked the place where the
machine-gun crew had slept dur-
ing the day and where men off duty rested
during the night

  there were several mess kits stacked up
very neatly and the hard-boiled man had
discovered them they had a kind of
slum in them with bits of something that
tasted like sausage floating around the
yanks had not eaten since they could re-
member and the slum tasted doubly good
on that account

  the night began to grow cold and the
men were more or less wet from crawling
around in the water in the bottom of the
ditch but they wrapped themselves in the
german overcoats and were quite comfort-
able one of the men began to prowl
around and explore as it happened there
was no whispering going on at that minute
id so the sound of him taking the lid off a
iess kit was clearly heard

  whats in that asked the hard-boiled
man curiously

  nothing said the other man quickly
there was something in his tone that told
the rest he was lying

  lemme see said one of the nearest and
they could hear him crawling

  no said he solemnly after a few sec-
onds there aint nothin in it just a old
empty can

  this man overdid it he used too much
energy in saying that the can was empty
the entire company moved over at once

  gimme that mess kit cried several at
once

  sounds of strife

  theres beer in it -if it aint full o

beer you guys tried to hold out on us
all right you wont get none

  the idea said nell indignantly of
you two birds tryin to hog all this beer
why theres enough to get a regiment
soured well all have a go at it and if
theres any left you can have it

  there was plenty enough for all however
and the only thing the men lacked to make
them at peace with the world was a smoke
but this was impossible

  now then began nell at what he
thought was an opportune moment we
dont want to lose sight of our mission i
suppose this is or was a patrol to find out
the strength of the enemy between the town
and the river well we know but it dont
do no good unless we get back with it and
itll be daylight pretty priesa and when day-
light comes we want to be far from here
cant we hang out in the culvert durin
the day asked one of the men sadly

  no we cant snapped the hard-boiled

man what the - yuh think youre

gettin a dollar a day for

  theyre playin - on the other side

the track said goodrich man im
tellin yuh its warm over there

  well its only a question of time before
were discovered and then theyll bring out
a gang and do some bayonet drill on us if
we go back weve got a chance i know
where theres a ford and all we have to do
is to follow the ditch to it weve got a gun
an it dont take but a spoonful of brains
to make it go or the boche wouldnt be
usin it

  well be cornin down on their riverside
guns from the rear so they wont bother us
none and if any of em do get argumen-
tative we can shoot a yard or two of bul-
lets at em

  well so you say said one of the men
after a long pause but i for one dont crave
to try to cross that field with all this throw-
down goin on

  listen said nell i was a sergeant in
this mans army when all you birds knew
about germany was that they made brass

bands and beer now if theres any-

here that dont want to do as i say just
step right up an say so like a man an he
wont need to wait till he gets on the other
side o the track to collect his insurance
good said the hard-boiled man you
tell em capn an let me help bury the
dead
 

adventure

  no one however accepted nells offer
and when he gave the word they all got
slowly to their feet and casting off their
overcoats and blankets went down to the
culvert and crawled in the hard-boiled man
first then goodrich and curran with the
machine-gun and nell last to make sure
that no one got lost in the tunnel

some time before daybreak the
captain of g company that held
a sector of the line on the south
bank of the river was making his
final inspection of the command there
was to be a general advance in an hour and
the word had come down from brigade
headquarters that the attack must not fail

  the losses so far had already been too
high and there was no material gain to show
for them up-river units of the division
had succeeded in crossing the river and
maintaining their position on the opposite
bank down-river patrols had crossed and
were holding out but unless the battalion
to which g company belonged crossed
and took the town before it both right and
left flanks would have to fall back

  divisional and corps artillery had been
shelling the german artillery positions on
the heights and machine-gun one-pounder
and stokes mortar had been hammering
the wheat and the field between the river
and the railroad embankment since eleven
oclock the town was being reduced to a
pile of unsightly ruins

  the captain however was not cheered
he had lost a platoon that had gone on
patrol across the river his men had been
without sleep for two nights their rations
were all gone ammunition was low gren-
ades were not to be had and about three
men out of every squad were casualties

  if the artillery preparation was thorough
enough the task of taking the town would
not be very great certainly there were
enough shells being sent over the fields
and the hillsides fairly glittered with the
flashes of the explosions

  it is one thing though to fire a bom-
bardment i on known gun positions and
strong points but it is another thing to fire
blindly into an area trusting to luck that
the hostile positions will be destroyed the
chances of the latter are rather slim how-
ever the germans had undisputed control
of the air and it was impossible for the
allies reconnaisance planes to take any

photographs or even to protect their own
lines from aerial attack so the artillery did
what they could and hoped for the best

  they swept up and down the hills and
from side to side the machine-guns laid
down a barrage on the railroad and the one-
pounders hammered the wheat the cap-
tain of g company fingered his first-aid
packet and was thankful he was not a mar-
ried man

  captain yelled some one in his ear
theres a patrol come back

  a patrol from across the river where
are they

  right over here sir

  the soldier led the captain to where nell
and his companions crouched in the shelter
of the railroad track the captured gun that
they had brought back to the american
side of the river at their feet

  whos in command here asked the
captain are you there trelawney
the lieutenant was killed said some
one

  wheres the rest of the men

  this is all that are left said nell i
took charge of em

  there was a long silence during which a
medical corps man who had been doing up
the wounded mans arm put away his band-
ages and went off

  whats it like over there asked the
captain finally

  nell told him of all that had passed that
the wheat was probably held in strength
but that along the ditch and about the ford
there were now no germans but good ones

  how do i know that this is straight
asked the captain how do i know you
men havent been cooling coffee over in the
wheat all day this yarn sounds a little
high 

  nell made no reply but tossed something
down that clinked one aftef the other the
men did the same the captain put down
his hand in astonishment at his feet he
felt a pile of leather belts with square buck-
les field glasses a german helmet and
several pistols

  did you capture that gun too said
the captain in a much milder even apolo-
getic tone

  yessir said all the men

  well hang on to it and take it back with
you when you go were going across in
half an hour ill be back again before we
go i want to know where that ford is
a sergeant of cavalry



  theyre bound theyll kill us aint
they said some one after the captain had
departed

  there was profane assent but no one
made any further comment the men who
had lost their rifles hunted around until
they had found others and each made sure
he had plenty of ammunition there was
a pile of belts that had been taken from
casualties and those who were shy anything
helped themselves from these

  suddenly there was a change in the sound
of the bombardment a new note had been
struck some new instrument had joined
the orchestra then whistles began to blow
and men spoke rapidly like the members
of a football team encouraging each other
before the kick-off

  the men that were speaking here how-
ever were the corporals and sergeants urg-
ing their men to their feet and giving a few
final directions nell rose with his rem-
nant of a platoon the captain suddenly
appeared

  wheres that cavalryman he cried
here show us that ford just show me
the approximate place weve got bridges
up but they may not last come on men
forward

  the line moved over the narrow gage
track

dawn was just breaking
things that had been invisible
and black were now a light gray
directly overhead was a patch of
rosy sky in front of the advance on the
opposite bank of the river was a high white
wall formed by the barrage and a smoke
screen out of this wall came rocket after
rocket green red and white the men got
to the river before the counter barrage be-
gan to fall

  hows your boil nell asked goodrich
who was beside him

                                         e

  boil it aint bothered me since it bust
capn i got more on my mind than boils

  if you guys keep on calling me captain
said nell ill begin to think-look out

  the two went to earth blam each
looked to see if the other was hit but
they were both unscathed although covered
with dirt they got down to the river
tripping and falling about in the reeds of
the marsh and found a bridge there that
the engineers had laid during the night

the pontoons pitched and heaved and the

  

bridge swayed up and down for the ger-
man shells werelashing the river into waves
such as it had never before seen in all its
thousands of years of existence many of
the men were too impatient to await their
turn to cross on the bridge and plunged into
the river half wading half swimming across

  lookit our ford said goodrich with a
slight catch in his voice

  nell looked there were guns guarding
that ford and they were whipping the river
into foam there was no reason now why
they should hold their fire this time they
wanted to kill and not to capture

  why do you suppose they didnt shoot
at us when we were goin back asked nell

  those guns that are doin that may be
clear up in the town said goodrich or
back in the hills i bet there aint many
guns workin on this bank not with that
barrage goin

  from down-stream came a tremendous
explosion nell did not want to look but
he was unable to keep from turning his
head a bridge down there had just been
destroyed and the river was black with the
fragments of it and men struggling in the
water

  nell reached the farther bank and stum-
bled through the rushes to hard ground
things were getting lighter every minute
but there was so much smoke about that it
was impossible to see more than a yard or
two nell went into the wheat a way and
looked around

  the line had halted and was waiting un-
til all were across the river before advanc-
ing the hard-boiled man appeared drip-
ping he had swum the river and was
plastered with mud and weeds a hump-
backed man came in from the smoke and
fell on goodrichs neck

  what the- cried goodrich

  nell took a second look at the newcomer
it was curran

 what the-you got on your back

cried nell i didnt know you

 my vase said curran i got it
strapped on to me and my blouse over it
sos it wont shine nor get hurt i aint
takin no chance on losin it

  i thought you threw that away long
ago

  well i went and found it again while
we was waitin

  some more men arrived their eyes wide
and their breath panting 


adventure

  they got our bridge said they blew

it all to-

  nell wondered why he had not heard the
shell that destroyed the bridge and decided
it had been drowned in the tumult some
more men ran up and then threw themselves
down on the line

  we come across a ford said they
the boche laid off shoo tin on it for a
minute and we come over

  more men came in singly and by twos and
threes they were all dripping wet from
the river and cursing because their wet
clothes hampered their movements the
smoke began to grow thinner a barrage
like time and tide has a habit of moving
on schedule regardless of whether the in-
fantry is held up or not it was now half-
way to the town and the advance had not
left the wheat

  forward g company called some
one forward

  everybody up said nell

  all with yuh capn cried the hard-
boiled man and scrambled to his feet

  some of the men who had heard looked
in astonishment at nell they noted the
cut of his uniform and decided he must be
a strange officer from some other outfit
that had joined during the night the
advance began again

  the barrage had passed on the ma-
chine-gunners who had stayed in their
holes while the shells were falling about
them directly the barrage lifted clambered
out set up their guns and turned loose the
artillery on the heights able to employ di-
rect fire began to work overtime this
sleet of steel struck the advancing infantry
and they laid down immediately the ma-
chine-guns continued to fire and the artillery
tossed shells around but the men lay still
and after a while the enemy turned his at-
tention to the riverbank once more

  whistles blew and the advance began
once more with a snarl of anger at the
americans tenacity the german guns
opened on the line again the sound of
the machine-guns was much louder this
time probably every gun in the sector was
concentrated upon the infantry in the field

  this was a welcome respite for the engi-
neers trying to construct new bridges and
for the men trying to wade and swim
across but it was hard on g company
the men were pounded by machine-gun and
rifle by minenwerfer and field gun

  whoa said goodrich im hit

  he went down and nell grabbed his arm

  whered it get you he asked

   taint nothin said goodrich strug-
gling to his knees i just stubbed my
toe help me up

  he tried to smile but his face was the
color of clay

  lie down said nell the stretcher
bearersll take care of you lie quiet
now

  all right said goodrich when im
in hospital ill have a drink for you

  then before nells very eyes-thudthud-
thudl-there were two holes in goodrichs
blouse and another through his helmet
nell felt the arm that he was holding grow
limp and he lowered poor goodrich to the
ground again

  nell gripped his rifle and started forward
his mind was so numbed by his comrades
death that it was a minute or two before
he was thoroughly himself again then he
noticed that there were very few men in
sight the company had been advancing
with wide intervals but there had been a
good many men visible just the same

  now however in just that scant space
of time most of them had disappeared
instead of a hundred or so there were not
more than twenty at the outside to the
left of nell was a chaucat gunner and be-
yond him about twenty yards away were
two men together

  in front of nell a little way were curran
and the hard-boiled man but there was a
cloud of smoke from a minenwerfer bomb
or a shell to the right that hid that part of
the line

  nell felt his rifle shoved back with a vig-
orous push he did not need to look at the
scar on the butt to know a bullet had hit it
a long blast of the whistle nell lay down
in a few seconds the hard-boiled man came
crawling back

  to the rear said he the old man
says to the rear he give the signal

  after that nells recollection was a little
dim he thought he crawled a way and
then ran a way and then crawled some
more but he could not be certain all that
he was sure of was that when he reached the
wheat he was on his feet and that he passed
two or three men who were doing their best
to run he came to the marsh where the
mud was ankle deep and clinging but he
went through like the--s cow then he
a sergeant of cavalry-



was at the rivers edge where three men
were hammeringtakes

  here comes the bride said one of these
men

  is it pay-day or did you hear mess-call
blow asked another

  a shell burst up-stream and the falling
water showered the men

  i wish id brought my slicker said the
first speaker

  some more men came down through the
marsh and halted they felt a little foolish
at appearing before so many of their com-
rades in such unseemly haste across the
river were a lot of men waiting to advance
lying down with very wide intervals and in
the river itself and along both sides were
engineers working as fast as they could to
put up bridges to replace those destroyed

the fire was not so hot here but
men were being hit just the same
and cries for first-aid came with
alarming frequency across the
river a man raged up and down like a mad-
man if he kept on he would be hit but he
seemed to care very little this man was
evidently an officer but he wore no in-
signia of rank and might be anything from
a major up

  he was raging because the companies
across the river had advanced too soon he
was raging because the artillery barrage was
clear over in the town by now and particu-
larly did he foam at the mouth because the
men in the field had fallen back

  inasmuch as it would have been murder
to keep them there any longer his remarks
as to the color of their livers were very un-
just he also spoke to the engineers the
engineer officer invited him to build his own
bridges if he didnt like it

  furthermore the engineer officer offered
to polish his nose rank or no rank in the
heat of battle be it known a difference of a
few numbers of rank amounts to very little
between officers of different branches

  the man who raged was the colonel of the
regiment he came to himself after a few
minutes and realized that cursing would do
very little good he was not to be blamed
for being a trifle emphatic for his regiment
was vanishing into thin air and as yet he
had not gained a foot of ground so then
he took a good look up and down the river
and saw the engineers were making progress
after all

  in one place some tree trunks had been
thrown across in another section of nar-
row gage track was being lashed to posts
and in a third enough boats had been col-
lected from the wreckage of the first bridge
to make another the colonel then went
back across the narrow gage track to a hole
where there were three very sad-looking
men armed with pistols this was the ar-
tillery liaison detail a sergeant and two
privates

  how long would it take to get a message
to your guns asked the colonel

  its about two miles said the sergeant
it will take half an hour anyway want
me to go sir

  no you stay with me send both
men each by a different route i dont want
this message to go astray tell your colonel
that i want the barrage to start over again
we havent even got off the bank yet

  the sergeant gave the necessary direc-
tions to the men telling them the route they
should follow and that if they could get into
the infantry brigade p c they could tele-
phone back the directions all that they
had to do was to say that the barrage should
begin again and that the infantry would
move when it did

 the men went out and ducked and
dodged across the field to the woods the
sergeant watched them go wistfully he
had little liking for his job and when the
advance began would like it even less

  meanwhile nell on the far bank of the
river laid aside his rifle and pitched in with
the engineers he and the survivors of his
company drove stakes lashed planks and
carried wounded out of the way suddenly
some one seized nells shoulder it was the
captain his uniform torn and dirty and his
helmet and gas mask gone

  come show us that ditch of yours
said the captain

  nell led the way along the bank some-
times knee deep in mud and other times up
to his shoulders in the water at last he
came out on the shallow bar of the ford
the engineers had discovered it and the bar
was marked with a row of stakes on the
opposite bank were machine-gunners and
some men with things that looked like
stove pipes and fourth of july cannon
the stove pipes were mortars and the toy
cannon one-pounders

  show these officers your ditch said the
captain


adventure

  nell led them upstream to where the ditch
came out on the bank and two of the officers
reconnoitered

  nothing there but some dead krauts
reported the officer in a few minutes
come on soldier lead out

  the officer waved to the men across the
ford to come over which they did holding
their weapons out of the water then
bending double they followed nell and the
three officers up the ditch there had been
shelling in that ditch since nell was in it
last there were holes in it aplenty along
the sides and on the edge just now how-
ever it was blissfully calm

  its a wonder we arent fired on mut-
tered one of the officers we must be under
observation

  cheer up said the other theyll let
us set up the guns and then theyll shower
down and after that we wont need to
worry

  one of these officers was the machine-
gunner and the other commanded the one-
pounders last in line were the trench
mortars and it appeared from the conver-
sation that these were not to fire but to go
forward when the opportunity offered

 the machine-guns were set up ammuni-
tion prepared and the squad leaders lay
down with one hand in air to show that their
squads were ready the section leaders
reported ready and the officer commanded
 range  at the town first section
right half second section left half over-
head commence firing at the blast of the
whistle

  the officer turned around

  i wish you werent going to fire your

-pop-guns in here said he to the one-

pounder man the boche can hear those
things going clear back in the hills and
theyll start to iron you out meanwhile
well get ours

  if you knows of a better ole grinned
the one-pounder officer go to it

  you and your better hole growled the
machine-gunner wait till the barrage
starts youll want to find it

  the two officers thereupon sat and bit
their thumbs nell looked them over
they wore no insignia not even a stripe on
the cuff of their blouses and nell reflected
that his was the better uniform of the three

  corporal davis said the machine-gun
officer take two men and find major
hemenway i think youll get him on this

  side of the river near that bridge theyre
making out of the railroad track tell
him that were in position in the ditch and
that well open fire with the artillery bar-
rage whenever he wants fire on any new
targets send me a runner

  waiting for the barrage to start was the
most trying time that nell had yet ex-
perienced the gunners kept inspecting
sights and the loaders were forever rattling
clips of ammunition the enemy fire had
not ceased a second but it was all on the
far side of the river and on the river itself
the casualties must be terrific

  nell could hear the shouting and the
bawling of orders in the river and decided
the men were crossing and coming up into
the wheat he trembled lest the enemy
barrage shift from the narrow gage track
to the wheat but fortunately it did not
suddenly there was a loud whack overhead
four or five shrapnel shells had burst above
the field

  theyre white cried the machine-
gunner theyre ours stand by for the
barrage they fired those shells to show
the observers where the barrage was going
to fall

  the barrage let down with the clap of a
closing cellar door the officers whistle
peeped faintly and away roared the ma-
chine-guns the distant town suddenly
became shrouded in smoke and began to
gush gray and yellow clouds of it like a gi-
gantic chimney

  the big eight-inch boys were dumping
gas and high explosive in among those
houses the barrage went forward slowly
and the smoke barrage that went with it
covered the entire field and shut off the view
of the machine-gunners they continued
to fire however and trusted that their
shooting was effective nell watched for
the wave of infantry but saw nothing of
them the barrage passed on was well
into the field and still he saw no sign of the
americans

  the-fools he cried theyve gone

and gummed it again

  after a minute or two by straining his
eyes to their utmost he could see here and
there a group of black dots just visible a
second then gone they were the helmets
of men crawling in the wheat higher
authority that is brigade and divisional
commanders had taken a hand in this thing

the second attack was more carefully
a sergeant of cavalry



planned the machine-guns and one-
pounders with nell were protecting it from
the flank more artillery was being em-
ployed to neutralize the enemy fire and the
men instead of advancing in mass were
going forward in small rapidly moving
groups hard to see and harder to hit the
barrage was going slower too much slower
than before and the infantry had plenty of
time to blot out a machine-gun here and
there before the enemy gunners could come
out of their holes so with a little less haste
and a little more care than the first the
second attack progressed very favorably

nell idly watching one of the
flank guns noticed the squad
leader beckon to the sergeant and
when the sergeant went over
pointed into the field toward the railroad
track on the right the sergeant had a
look with his glasses then went for the
officer there was a great deal of pointing
and looking and discussion and finally the
officer crept over to nell

  whats at the other end of this ditch
he yelled

  theres a culvert that goes under the
railroad track shouted nell

  the lieutenant asked another question
but with the guns pounding and the one-
pounder whining nell could not hear it
though he could see the cords in the officers
throat working when he yelled finally
by putting his cupped hands to nells ear
the officer got out what he wanted to say

  - are you deaf or dont you under-

tand english i say are there any of our
troops on the other side of that-rail-
road track for the love of - show

some signs of intelligence

  the officer was a bit excited in the first
place his target was obscured by smoke and
in the next place one of his guns had come
unclamped and had probably been spraying
the americans for an unknown time and in
the third place the fact that the machine-
guns had not been fired on was driving the
officer mad

  the boche knew they were there of
that he was certain they had plenty
of guns to shoot him up and yet they
didnt something was wrong and he
didnt have the slightest idea of what it
was nell yelled in his ear twice before
he paid any attention

  there are boche on the other side of

  that railroad track cried nell boche
boche you poor jiggering jug-head

  he added the last because he thought the
officer couldnt hear him the officer
however had caught the word boche
he jumped a foot and had another look
with his field glasses then he handed them
or rather thrust them at nell and pointed
nell turned the glasses in theindicateddirec-
tion there were some yanks under the rail-
road track setting up machine-guns he
handed back the glasses and ihe officer pro-
ceeded to have a rush of blood to the head
judging by the color of his face

  listen he bellowed if those are our
men theyve got no business there dash
and blank and stripe and star and blazes
are they boche or arent they

want me to go ask them asked nell
the officer heard that as a deaf man al-
ways hears what he isnt supposed to he
gave nell a dirty look and nodded his head
the officer then took another look

  jump on the bank he cried theyre
looking at us tell em to come over here
nell jumped up and seeing the distant
men looking at him waved his hand he
could see the white of every face looking his
way

  give me your glasses he cried

  the officer saw the gesture if he did not
get the words he handed up his glass
nell took one look

  theyre boche he cried theyre
boche their uniforms are dry as a bone
if they came across the river theyd be all
mud and wet

  the officer could not hear him and nell
shouted the word boche in his ear as
loudly as he could but the officer shook his
head he was not going to turn his guns on
some americans just because he didnt
know where they came from and nell said
they were boche

  then nell gave a real screech and seized
the officers arm the officer followed
nells horror-stricken gaze the gun on the
right was out of action its crew lying quiet-
ly beside it two of the next guns extra men
were in heaps and a third was tearing open a
first-aid packet a blood soaked puttee
told what he was going to use it for

  the lieutenant started across the ditch
and went down as if the earth had caved in
under him nell still had the glasses and
these he turned on the men by the embank-
ment they were still looking his way but


adventure

their guns were not the ones that were doing
the killing

  you boob cried nell to himself in
the culvert of course

  there was a gun there sure enough with
men in o d around it nell fled he was
outside the ditch and so just safe from the
machine-guns fire he ran with all his
might the one thought in his mind that
trench mortars were death on machine-guns
and that in the lower end of the ditch were
trench mortars

  as nell approached the lower edge of the
ditch he saw that there was some confusion
there the one-pounder squads were hur-
riedly getting out several wounded men
were on the crest of the ditch and officers
and non-coms were exercising their lungs

  the first casualties from the machine-
gun in the culvert had not been noticed but
when three guns went out of action the ces-
sation of sound was easily noticeable

  it was also possible for the men in the re-
maining sections to make themselves heard
nor did it take very long for them to discover
the direction the firing was coming from
some went out on the front edge others to
the rear no attempt was made to reply
to the fire the main idea was to get out of
the way of it

  at this stage of affairs nell arrived and
seizing a sergeant by the arm imparted the
news that there were boche in yank uni-
forms setting up guns and that the gun
that was shooting down the ditch was in
the culvert the sergeant dragged nell to
an officer

  in the culvert huh cried the officer
up the ditch well well know where

to go then lets change position and-

quick or we wont have a man left

  he blew his whistle and waved his arm
wildly then he sent a runner to the trench
mortar men who were on the other side of
the ditch preparing to go forward to the
infantry

  the effective range of a trench mortar is
only seven hundred yards and they had
been left in the ditch until the infantry had
got to that distance from the town and a
favorable position for the employment of
the mortars had been found

  meanwhile said the officer lets have
a look at the boche-yanks we dont want
to go shooting up our own men mustnt
trespass on the artillerys privileges show
us em

   it was rather difficult to see because of the
smoke but the officer wriggling like a
snake moved around until he got his glasses
on the gun crews by the embankment and
nell saw his jaw muscles tighten then
ensued some directions in pantomime and
the gun crew began to leap from shell hole to
shell hole the officer stayed where he was
to adjust fire

  ping went the one-pounder the officer
signaled some correction and the gun fired
again very rapidly for fifteen or twenty
seconds

  thats a bunch of dead yanks or a
bunch of dead boche now one or the other
said the officer slipping down into nells
shell hole but i think theyre boche as
you say they dont look as if they came
across the river and ill bet the reason there
was no fire on this dilch was because the
boche artillery was told to lay off any yanks
they saw in it

  anyway yanks have no business being
out there on the flank that way the wise
eggs even had hotchkiss guns to shoot
with now about these birds in the cul-
vert theyre still firing down the ditch
they got the runner i sent to the mortar
outfit lets see if we cant dig em out
theres no crossing the ditch with them in
there

  the gun advanced and nell went with the
officer telling him how the culvert had an
elbow in it and how deep it was and the
officer cursed because half of his platoon had
gone with the trench mortars just at the
time when he needed them most

  say cried the officer suddenly you
better skip over to whoevers in command
of the advance now and tell him his ma-
chine-gun support on this flank is no more
ill drop a couple of shells at the entrance
to that hole and you run before the smoke
clears we may be all day getting that
bunch out of there

nell wondered why the officer
didnt send one of his own run-
ners but the officer wanted to
conserve his own personnel for he
might have need of them later in the day
so nell gathered himself together and when
the little gun had dropped three shells one
after the other at the mouth of the culvert
he galloped across the ditch and dived into a
shell hole on the far side there he fell
himself over to be sure he had not been hit
a sergeant of cavalry



panted a while until he got his breath back
and then began to crawl from shell hole to
shell hole until he should come up with the
infantry

  nell had about a thousand yards to
cover this may not seem to be a very
great distance but when a man must make
it on his stomach crawling from shell hole
to shell hole and waiting in the bottom of
each one until the fire lets up for a second or
two it takes an unbelievable length of time

  the infantry had made considerable ad-
vance this the germans discovered
stopped trying to prevent the crossing of
troops along the river and concentrated
their fire on the men in the field the ad-
vance was supported locally by machine-
gun one-pounder and stokes mortar and
the artillery still pounded the german
positions

  however the enemy had destroyed every
bridge or makeshift as fast as it was put up
and bridge building had finally stopped
because there was no more material nor
were there any engineers to put it up if there
had been what few reserves had been left
across the river had been forced to come
over by wading or by paddling themselves
across on the wreckage of the bridges

  nell had not gone very far before he
found the backwash of the attack first
he came upon a machine-gun set up and
evidently in working order but abandoned
then he found rifles blouses rocket pistols
helmets water-soaked gas-masks a pair of
field glasses with one side shot away a
broken stretcher scattered among the
wreckage were the dead a great many of
them they had on their gas masks and
nell wondered if they had been in the same
hape as his

  he had got a bullet through the canister
when the patrol had been shot up and his
subsequent wading in the river had allowed
ithe water to get in and make cake out of the
contents effectually closing the intake
valve so that when he had put on his mask
he nearly smothered before he could get it
off again

  there were occasional wounded in the
shell holes but they were unable to con-
verse through their masks even had they
had the inclination

  id better get a mask thought nell
or ill be ending my mission right here
ive got a hunch that all ill get out of this
wild rush to the front will be a pat on the

back with a spade but theres no use in
bringing it on

  he looked around the field and sure
enough saw a gas mask a shell covered
him with dirt but he paid it no heed he
had ceased to notice either the shriek and
clang of shells or the whine and crack of
bullets any more than a traveler on a train
is conscious of the whir of the wheels be-
neath him

  had he had more experience he would
have known that a gas-mask that was
thrown away must be useless for it was the
last thing a soldier would part with this
particular gas-mask was full of somebodys
lunch

  nell rolled sidewise into a shell hole it
was deeper and the side showed signs of
having been squared with a shovel nell
turned his head and discovered that there
were several germans in the hole but they
were harmless they must have been a
machine-gun crew but their gun was gone
the men that had killed them had taken the
gun along to use in the attack

  these germans also had on masks the
german mask was made of leather a cone-
shaped affair with a little gadget like the
bottom part of a kerosene lantern at the
point of the cone this gadget contained
the material that neutralized the gas the
apparatus was suspended from the wearers
face and not tied around his neck and be-
hind his back as the american mask was

  it was therefore only necessary to remove
the germans helmet to get his mask off
this nell did gas is nothing to be squeam-
ish with and it is said of the british that
they took more desperate measures than this
in the early days when gas was first used
and they had no masks to protect them-
selves against it

  a few holes beyond nell came on a trench
mortar which its crew were swabbing out

  wheres the man in command of this
shebeen cried nell lifting his mask

  the mortar gunners made gestures f
ignorance with their hands nell there-
upon went his way he had instinctively
clung to his rifle all this time but his arm
was at the point of falling off from fatigue
and finally he let the rifle go there were
lots of them lying around and he could pick
one up almost anywhere if he needed one

  without his rifle he found he could roll
like a barrel which he did and after explor-
ing about six holes found one where three


adventure

men lay on gray blankets looking over the
edge from time to time one of the men
had field glasses and nell addressed himself
to him

  wheres the major asked nell

  hes dead said the other pulling the
side of his mask away from his cheek and
letting it snap back again

  whos in command

  the officer pointed to himself he had a
first-lieutenants bar on the cuff of his
blouse

  ive just come from the machine-gun
company on the right said nell theyve
been cleaned out

  the officer nodded understandingly
maybe he knew it anyway how are the
one-pounders he asked

  i took them up to the track to clean
up some machine-guns said nell i left
them at it and came up to report

  can you give us a hand here asked the
officer

  nell nodded

  the officer then slid over and hooking
the rubber of his mask over nells ear be-
gan to speak rapidly

  im in command here theres a com-
pany on the right that hasnt got any non-
coms left even and im afraid theyll break
weve got the razor edge of a chance if we
can once get the men to rush if we get into
the town well be safe from lots of things we
arent out here they can send us over all
kinds of supports after dark

  ive been sending out runners to have
all the machine-guns and trench mortars
and everything in sight fire on the town
steadily for twenty minutes and then well
get up and dash for it its three-thirty
now we can hang on for another hour
and a half-few casualties if we dont try to
advance-and at five oclock over we go
can you take em along

  nell nodded

  whats your rank asked the officer
you may be my senior for all i know

nell laughed in his mask and
was about to assure the officer
that he was only a private when
he suddenly changed his mind
his tailor-made uniform-was that it no
sir he remembered the machine-gun offi-
cers field glasses he had them still about
his neck the strap plainly visible and the
glasses in his gas-mask carrier where the

mask itself was carried when not being worn

  nells american mask had been hanging
by its hose for some time so the lieutenant
thought nell was an officer

  so i am said nell to himself im
just as good as one maybe better i used
to be a sergeant of cavalry

  therefore he nodded vigorously to the
officer shook his hand and crawled off in
the direction the officer had pointed out to
him where his new company lay he be-
gan to find the shell holes full of wild-eyed
infantry some of whom fired at the houses
in the town and others sent rifle grenades
tumbling

  nell began to wonder how he would know
where his bunch were he rolled into a
shell hole and found four men in it eating
sausage and cheese out of a german knap-
sack without further parley one of the
men offered nell some and he remembering
that he had had no food since early morning
took some willingly

  one of the men suddenly removed a piece
of sausage from his mouth which he left
open he appeared to listen a moment and
then suddenly turned on his knees and
cautiously stuck his head over the side of
the shell hole nell heard a clamor of
voices like the sound a crowd makes when
the circus parade comes into view the
man on his knees jumped to his feet and tore
off his gas-mask

  here comes our friends gang he cried
and he began to fire his rifle as rapidly as he
could

  the basis of the german tactical system
has been since the time of frederick the
great that of attack in mass their belie
has been that while the mass attack provide
for a short time a very large target the effect
of the mass on arriving at a thin firing-line
will be irresistible the system often works
or it would not have been retained so long

  the mass relies mainly upon shock ac-
tion for its effect the same as charging
cavalry do and like charging cavalry the
mass fails before intrenched or unbroken
infantry however when an enemy ad-
vance has proceeded some time when the
officers and non-commissioned officers have
been killed off or wounded when men are
scattered here and there in shell holes and
the units of platoon company and bat-
talion are all tangled up in each other the
opportune moment for the employment of
shock action has arrived
a sergeant of cavalry



  nell poked his head over the edge of the
shell hole oh man there was a column
of big husky huns advancing at the gallop
so near that nell could see their expressions
they looked mean their coal-scuttle
helmets shadowed their faces and from un-
der the vizors peered burning eyes tight-
lipped scowls and teeth skinned by blood-
curdling grins

  these boche were not tired looking their
uniforms were neither wet nor torn they
displayed intense eagerness to drink hot
blood from yankees throats nell thought
of a crowd he had once seen sweep off the
center field bleachers and start for an
umpire

  pop bottles began to fly they werent
really pop bottles but stick grenades as
the sound soon told nell remembered
that once upon a time a famous man had
said that the americans had no quarrel with
the german people nell wished that man
was there then to remind those germans of
that fact

  the germans had come out from behind
the town-there must have been a trench
there-and were attacking the right of the
american advance two-thirds of the
americans could not fire because their own
men were between them and the germans
and the germans had foreseen that when
the counter attack had been planned
they moved along rapidly

  some yanks stood up in the first bunch
of shell holes and gave battle the counter
attack rolled over them without even hesi-
tating the germans being very nearly
fifty to one the men in the next shell
hole had their hands in the air when they
stood up they might just as well have
put up a fight some of the americans
began to go away and nell remembered
that he had no rifle

  he looked to see if there were any on
the ground and discovered that he was
alone and the rush not ten feet away
something struck him on the arm numbing
it he thought at once that he had been
hit but on looking he saw a stick grenade
still rolling in the bottom of the shell hole
nell retired a man that disputes the way
with an express train is not called brave

  all along the line the americans gave
back the men werent panic-stricken
but they saw quite clearly that they were
licked and there was no use staying there
to be mopped up by those wild barbarians

with their sawtoothed bayonets it was
lucky the germans had no cavalry thought
nell

  a cavalry charge at this time would have
gone through and through the lines lashed
a retreat into a panicky rout hurled these
men back in a mob upon their machine-
guns and driven the remnants into the
river to drown infantry while they may
achieve the same initial success as cavalry
can not exploit it for they can not move
any faster or even as fast as the men who
are retreating

now in back of the yank ad-
vance had been machine-guns
one-pounders and mortars using
overhead fire when the ameri-
cans reached these guns there was some
effort made to stop them there were non-
coms and an officer or two there who made
heroic efforts to get the men to turn the
american artillery unaided by balloon or
plane and firing blindly for the most part
had its own observers on the high ground
across the river and these had telephoned
their guns the instant the rush began it
takes a minute or two to figure a little fire
dope and change the sights but now the
enemy column was getting a flock of shells
in its ranks the machine-guns were
pounding it with a will and its formation
began to have cracks in it

  panic is much like a fire in dry leaves
it starts from very little but it doesnt
take long to spread and the farther it goes
the worse it gets nell tried hard to keep
his head but every time he looked around
he saw men going and when he got to the
machine-gun line he could see two or three
guns already abandoned

  it looked as if all the ground that had
been taken with so much trouble and that
had cost so many lives was going to be lost
the germans were advancing from right to
left of the americans their idea being to
roll up the flank and drive the yanks out
of their positions so near the town hence
nell who had run parallel with the river
had got some distance from the boche
he jumped into a shell hole to catch his
breath and removed his mask to breathe
easier

  got a letter for me said a voice

  nell turned behold the high cheek-
bones and lantern jaw of the hard-boiled
man


adventure

  what do you mean letter asked nell
hoping the other had not seen him running

  you look like you was carryin the
mail said the hard-boiled man

  im looking for a rifle said nell
weakly

  huh grunted the other theres
plenty round

  show me one said nell and ill go
back and lick those boche single handed

  i got a luger you can have said the
other tendering nell a german pistol

 thats no good said nell you
cant do any good with that

  maybe you could scare em with it
suggested the hard-boiled man

  those birds arent so wise now re-
marked nell taking another peek out of
the hole

  the germans were being heavily pun-
ished by the american artillery and the
machine-guns across the river some ran
about in confusion and others were jumping
into shell holes and getting under cover
the other man stuck his head up

  right now said he would be the
time to go to give them guys a good swift
kick in the nose lets you an me get
some kind of a gang an go do it

  a third man wearing a mask arrived in
the shell hole with a rush he turned the
goggling eye-pieces upon each of the men
then he seized nells arm

  youre just the man im looking for
he rumbled faintly what are you doing
here

  we were just planning a counter at-
tack said nell

  the third man removed his mask re-
vealing the features of the lieutenant who
had thought nell was an officer and sniffed

  guess i can take a chance for a minute
he said those boche have been shaken
up by our artillery and what few guns ive
still got in the field here their officers
are getting them together for another rush
theyve been firing rockets for the last
ten minutes if we can get these men to
follow us i think we could do something
but weve got to do it quick you take
the left and ill take the right

  he looked at his wrist watch

  can you get them ready in five minutes
try it when i blow the whistle lets get
up and get at em and if we dont bust
up this attack were done

  he put his mask on again and was gone

  wed better start said the hard-
boiled man five minutes aint much to
warm up the feet o this gang

  think we ought to put on our masks
asked nell

  i aint goin to put on mine said the
other i got a cold an ive heard gas
was good for it

  the two started for the next shell hole
it was empty but the one beyond held
five men

  we aint got no ammunition said they
in response to nells announcement that a
counter attack would start in five minutes

  you wont need any said nell a
bayonet will do remember the only
chance we got is to get into that town
theyll wreck us if we try to cross the river
again

  the next shell hole received the news in
silence there were two men in it be-
tween that shell hole and the next out of
which stuck the muzzle of a machine-gun
some one threw a handful of gravel at the
two men at least that was what it felt like
little bits of dirt stung their faces the
two men went into the hole like frogs into
water

  machine-gun said nell

  they seen us agreed the hard-boiled
man

  some pieces of grass blew along the
gun was still going and it was very clear
that the organizers of the counter attack
would go no farther they inspected the
shell hole into which they had leaped

  there was a machine-gun in it standing
above a great pile of empty clips there
was a handful of rifle shells a first-aid
packet ripped open and empty and a can-
teen also empty here was evidence of
the desperate state of the americans an
advancing battalion with a river at its
back is liable to run short of ammunition
a rifleman can burn up a tremendous
amount of cartridges upward of four or
five hundred rounds in a day provided he
can get it the ammunition pockets in
his belt will hold only a certain amount
and the amount that can be carried in
bandoliers is limited

  in the shank of the day the dead and
wounded do not yield very much ammuni-
tion having been shooting all day them-
selves a machine-gun is in the same fix
as a rifle only more so because of its greater
rapidity of fire
a sergeant of cavalry



  the men of nells battalion had been
without sleep for two nights and had been
fighting hard since daybreak a soldier
gets tired as well as any other man their
wet clothes were uncomfortable and they
had drunk up all their water the boche
had given them a rub a few minutes ago
but they were too tired to run very far
hence they stayed in the shell holes into
which they had fled the next shove the
enemy would carry them to the river and
that would end the battalion

  nell had a pull at his canteen there
was just a trickle of water left in it

  - he muttered i dont remember

drinking all that water

  it was gone though and he thought
that the rest of the outfit must be just as
dry as he

  whatll we do now he asked his
companion

  we can stay in the hole said the hard-
boiled man an get killed when the boche
jump us or we can go along tellin these
guys that theres a party bein planned and
be killed right now

  i know something better than that
said nell lets yell and tell em to pass
it along

  try it

  nell cupped his hands around his mouth
and yelled

  counter attack in five minutes pass
it along

  he listened to see if any one repeated
what he said no sound save the faint
yelling of the boche non-coms distant
shells grunting and the yapping of guns in
the town he called again without suc-
cess

  you an me y ell together he said to the
hard-boiled man so they both yelled and
this time like an echo they heard someone
call

  counter attack in five minutes pass
it along

  the two listened to hear it passed but
they were disappointed

  lets yell again suggested nell and
took a deep breath

  wheeeee ivheeeee

  the whistle gasped nell

  then he and the hard-boiled man
jumped to their feet and went out of
the shell hole

  come on they cried lets go
everybody up come outta your hole

there was about as much
enthusiasm as there would have
been at a temperance meeting
with these same soldiers being
exhorted to step up and sign the pledge
there are about a thousand men in a bat-
talion and there should have been between
three and four hundred of them left to
spring to their feet with a ringing cheer but
after fourteen hours of fighting a man
neither springs nor cheers

  nells startled eye saw that not over
fifteen men were following him and the hard-
boiled man and that on the left where the
officer was supposed to be there was no one
a man jumped from shell hole to shell hole
blowing a whistle and they could see his
foot swinging but a kick in the stern is not
half so bad as a machine-gun bullet in the
bow and the men refused to come out

  its too late to go back now thought
nell were as dead as geese

  he continued to run forward a ger-
man stood up and aimed a pistol at him
nell threw up his hand and discovered that
he had in it a machine-gun ammunition
carrier a large thin box where had he
picked that up

  he forgot the german and looked about
for a rifle no sign of one behind him
he heard grunts his supporters were do-
ing up the germans nells breath came

pantingly now where were those -

boche he dodged between shell holes and
jumped over bodies what would he do
without a rifle when he reached the enemy

  he had not made up his mind when he
reached them and so there was nothing to
do but to shatter the ammunition box over
the head of one man and drive his fist into
another mans nose then the third
fourth and fifth men went down in a heap
with nell on the bottom it did not seem
that he had hit the ground before he was
up again and unencumbered his twenty
men were still with him and they had all
jumped into that same shell hole

  out we go cried the hard-boiled man
and away they went

  there is this disadvantage to a terrain
full of shell holes a force gets into them
and the tendency is to keep the head down
thus preventing the reception of signals or
commands such a condition is at its worst
among a soldiery like the german army
where the individual is not supposed to do
anj thinking for himself


adventure

  nell had armed himself with a german
rifle and had led his devoted band some
ten yards into the german line skewering
with a will before any notice was taken of
a counter attack the machine-gunners in
the town knew of it all right and must have
made the air black with harsh words but
they could not fire without endangering
their own men the twenty kept on
they made astonishing progress for the
germans were still disorganized and the
shouts of their officers did not convey any
meaning to them except that efforts at
further progress to the front were going to
be made

  when they caught the words ameri-
cans counter attack and heard ex-
cited voices they attributed it all to the
aforesaid efforts at reorganization thus
the americans found many of the enemy
still lying flat in their shell holes

  however the noise and shouts in german
continued and when it finally dawned on
the germans that their enemies were run-
ning wild in the shell holes they arose and
began to show signs of fight the ameri-
can machine-guns what few had any am-
munition left began to take toll of some
but the rest pulled the strings out of their
grenades and having hurled them bore
down upon the twenty americans whose
number was reduced to six in as little time
as it takes to tell it

  nell smote a helmet that proved to be
empty stung his hands and broke his rifle
then looking frantically about for another
rifle he saw a machine-gun a german two
of its crew dead and the rest running as
fast as possible toward a group of germans
who were getting ready to throw grenades

  git out the way cried nell and hurled
himself at the gun

  his fingers seized the handles and his
thumbs fell naturally into place on the
thumb-pieces the gun began to fire be-
fore nell knew how he had started it it
jumped and wiggled like an eel the vi-
bration was terrible nell sent a burst
into the ground that threw up a cloud of
grass and stones he leaned back and sent
one into air that probably went across the
river and landed among the guns on the
narrow-gage track and the third he got into
a line of boche that were running toward
him with very threatening looks

  wow howled nell as the line disap-
peared

  he saw another group to the right and
swung his gun at them expecting them to
go down like grass before the scythe they
did not mind a bit but continued to ad-
vance some firing their rifles and some
preparing grenades

  it is quite a stunt to shoot a heavy ma-
chine-gun and do it right because the force
of the machinery working has a very dis-
tracting effect on the aim and nell never
having fired a machine-gun in his life knew
nothing about resting his elbows on his
knees or pulling down hard on the handles
or any of the other ways of controlling the
guns actions

  cut out shootin that-gun cried a

voice in his ear here come our guys and
some of em might get hurted

  nell twisted his head and beheld the
hard-boiled man who pointed to a line of
trotting yanks they had heard the yell-
ing of the boche and poking up their heads
in expectation of attack had discovered the
thin brown line of yanks leaping about and
poking their bayonets at hunnish stomachs

  some of the yanks came out and began
to run toward the fight more followed
the lieutenant took heart again and urged
with foot and voice an advance is just
as contagious as a retreat once it gets
started in good shape more men sprang
up and hurried along they were as eager
now to close with the enemy as they had
been to stay in their holes a few minutes
before the germans began to give back

  dont bother me cried nell get
away from the front of this gun i got
work to do

  he turned the muzzle on some boche
who were moving a gun to a better hole
out of the fifty or sixty shots that he threw
at them one took effect upon the man who
was carrying the tripod the man let go
his hold the tripod fell on the foot of one
of the men with the gun who in turn let
go the gun and seized his foot

  the rest of the crew dropped what they
were carrying and took wings nell sent
some more bullets into the ground and be-
gant to feel fatigue in his arms the gun
coughed and was silent nell pushed on
the thumb piece but nothing happened
he pounded the breech as he had seen
gunners do when there was a jam but the
gun made no response

  it wont shoot unless it has bullets
said a man put in another belt
a sergeant of cavalry



the man ran by about his
business a german appeared
from somewhere a black-faced
man with a three days growth of
beard and a little round cap around his
ears he engaged in a bicker with a yank
and proved to be the better man then
he advanced on nell nell decided to go
elsewhere and raised a little cloud of dust
doing it

  hey wait for me called the hard-
boiled man and pausing to shoot the
black-faced german he followed nell

  you better get a rifle he panted in
nells ear when he had caught up with him
you hadnt ought to be chasin around
without one if one o these birds happens
to get mad at you you want to have some-
thin to talk back with heres a good hole
lets catch our breath

  no cried nell dont let this gang
get stopped again weve got these jerries
worried lets shove em good if we once

get into the town we can hold it till-goes

out follow me he cried as loudly as he
could for his dry throat follow me

  some near at hand heard and echoed his
shout

  keep goin they called into the
town

  some followed nell some stayed behind
to finish what they were doing still others
could not advance because the enemy in
front outnumbered them

  the contending forces swayed back and
forth a few seconds like wrestlers before
a fall in pitched fights like this but one
force can be victor there is no halfway
decision possible and the side that has the
most determination wins the americans
after having been pounded since daylight
by bullet grenade and shell ducked in the
river and burned by the sun in the fields
once thrown back and almost routed were
at last at hand grips with their enemy
within reach of the town and victory and
they would not be denied

  they gave a solemn shout more a croak
than a cheer and every man calling up
his last strength fired his last cartridge
hurled his last grenade and rushed forward
with the bayonet

  sthe germans recoiled gave ground
turned broke and scattered in wild flight
the americans followed and a fearful snarl-
ing crowd of both armies swept into the
town and jammed in the narrow streets

continued the battle there germans poured
from door window and cellar entrance
some fought others surrendered and a
-of a lot of good it did them

  nell pursued a german that ran before
him this german had a rifle and nell
wanted it at his side galloped the hard-
boiled man whooping the two of them
caught up with the german and leaped up-
on his back when nell arose he had the
rifle and was looking into the business end
of several more that protruded from a door

  git em he croaked and only hoping
that he would reach one before he was killed
he lunged forward

  he knew the rifles went off for he felt
the blast of their discharge then he was
through the door and shoving an impaled
german against the wall a table went
over and a man tripped in its cloth and
went headlong into a cupboard full of pans
that clanked dolefully a flower pot on a
window sill jumped a little and dissolved
into dirt and fragments

  if there is in hell any such turmoil and
noise as there was in that narrow street
then it must be hell indeed

  there was the continuous explosion of
grenades the crash of shells and the wild
yells now distant now under the very
windows of men gone back to their first
beginnings and clawing at each others
throat there was no rifle shooting the
americans wanted to feel their antagonists
under their blows butts bayonets and
naked hands were the things

  there was a sound of pounding feet
some yanks had just crowded in the door
but finding no one but two of their own men
went out again nell jerked his blouse
from the locked fingers of the men he had
fought with and got up where was the
hard-boiled man the house shook as
though it were built on the side of a track
and a train going by bits of plaster and
little clouds of dust filled the air the
trembling of the house and the rattling
noise continued

  theres a gun upstairs shrieked nell

  the hard-boiled man was by the fireplace
tugging at the overturned table nell
without knowing why helped him to right
it and shove it out into the room close
to the front wall the hard-boiled man
leaped upon it and clutching his rifle
crouched and then with a gasping effort
shoved upward with his bayonet through


adventure

the ceiling there was a shriek that all
the clamor in the street could not drown

  the hard-boiled man leaped in air and
clung to his rifle like an ape but the bayo-
net was wedged too tightly in plank and
lath-and something else-and would not
come out the trembling stopped and the
hard-boiled man let go his rifle and dropped
to the table

  the gun theyll fire through the ceil-
ing he cried to nell

  with the words there was a roar plaster
flew down and a cloud of dust leaped up-
ward from the floor the hard-boiled man
gave a leap and dived through a window
by the fireplace taking sash and broken
glass with him nell went through the
back of the house where a shell had broken
in the wall

  he was in a garden a tiny enclosure with
well kept rows of vegetables the boche
had been caring for that garden all sum-
mer the noise from the street came faint-
ly here but beyond the next row of houses
men ran hither and yon and smoke rose
above the roofs

  gee its dark said nell it must
be late

  he was surprized that the twilight had
come so soon he looked up at the sky
to assure himself that the sun was really
setting and that it was not his imagination
that made the air so gloomy the high
white clouds were pink and their edges
blue with shadow

  a great black shape passed swiftly over-
head just above the trees two more
followed and then three nell crouched
against the wall of the house on the wide-
flung wings of those fearful things he had
seen the thin arms of a cross and knew
the enemy airplane although he had never
seen one before

crash nells wits were some
time in returning after the heav-
ens had fallen that way and
when they did he found he had
turned and run back between the houses
almost to the street by which he had first
entered the town the dead lay in that
street like leaves and white-faced men
german and american fled together under
the trees

 another bomb and a house crumpled
in upon itself like a structure of cards
nell turned away there was a german

machine-gun crew lying in a heap on their
overturned gun almost at his feet and
among them was the hard-boiled man one
hand grasping the hilt of a hidden trench
knife and the other upon the handle of the
gun bombs rained down one on the heels
of another on boche and yank alike but
nell waited

  his rifle was gone long ago and he was
unarmed but he wanted to make sure he
could not help his comrade it was im-
possible the other had been shot through
and through by the machine-gun in the
room above but yet had taken toll of the
gun crew outside the window before he
died as he had lived a hard-boiled man

  and the rest of the gun crew must have
been dead when he had leaped on them or
had been killed soon after for he lay as he
had come from the window

  nell found himself running as does a
man in a dream four germans passed
him within arms length and though they
saw him clearly they made no sign but
kept on their way nell ran along going
sometimes through one wall and then the
other of a shattered house skipping over
shattered limbs of trees going through the
gate of a barbed-wire barricade a gate with
the saw-buck affair that closed it swung
wide as it had been to let the retreating
germans through

  he came at last to a great wide street
silent and deserted he ran down this
paying no heed to distant firing nor the
sounds of men running by him in the dark-
ness when the street ended at the river
he stopped but seeing the fragments of
the shattered bridge below him he jumped
down with the courage of desperation and
slipping and sliding from one block of
cement to the other got across to where
some machine-gunners on the other side
helped him to shore and gave him a blanket
to put over his head and in which he might
stifle his sobs

  there was a fearful calm along the riv-
er now the machine-gunners whispered
among themselves but their gun was silent
no lights went up when darkness fell for
the enemy knew there would be no more
attempts on the town that night the
corporal of the gun-squad finally detailed
two men for duty with the gun and he and
two others crawled into the hole where
nell lay and prepared to sleep

  better take a little rest said the
a sergeant of cavalry



corporal to nell you may need it

  i suppose well try our luck again in
the morning said nell

  not a chance said the other man
there aint enough of this division left to
take a machine-gun nest i got just one
clip for this gun an im savin it for any
jerry that tried to come across the same
way you did

  nell had thought that he could not sleep
but he did at last and had no sooner closed
his eyes than a man shook him violently by
the shoulder

  i will tell you that this man is dead
said a far-away voice im all tuckered
out shakin at him im fer lettin him lie

  im awake said nell what the-

do you want

  git up said another man stir your-
self we got to be on our way

  nell struggled to his feet the night was
black and a gentle rain soaked everything
it touched

  wheres the man that said we wouldnt
take another crack at the town groaned
nell

  we aint takin no cracks at no one
said the man who had awakened nell
we re bein relieved come on lets get
outta here

  relieved cried nell that may do
for you but im no machine-gunner how
do i know my outfits being relieved

  aw the whole -- divisions bein re-
lieved said the other whaddyuh think
we can stand this kind of a racket forever
ever play freeze-out well we been playin
freeze-out with the boche all our chips is
gone an some one else is gonna sit in

  a harsh whisper echoed from the dark-
ness

  now sergeant dont go hectorin me
about  spare barrel the only thought
i hev got is to get out uv range i hev
been a good soldier and done as you said
whenever you spoke but if you go botherin
an naggin at me now when i haint had
no sleep fer a week ill git into a state uv
mind now you better believe

  some one barked a command for silence
the machine-gunners began to move off
and some one else tugged at nells sleeve
he followed there was a tremendous
number of men moving in the darkness and
when they came out on the road and had
marched some distance they found it filled
with machine-gun carts ammunition carts

and infantry standing about in slickers
nell and his comrades increased their pace
he had no idea of how many there were
with him but from the sound there must be
quite a column they marched as fast as
they could chafed and swore in the halts
and swore roundly whenever trucks got in
the way

  think were outta range yet they
muttered

  day found them still on the road wet and
shivering for very few of them had any
slickers nell could now see that his ma-
chine-gunners had indeed joined a column
the remnants of the division men wild
eyed bearded and haggard their clothing
torn their equipment gone and their one
thought to put as much ground between
them and the enemy as they could while
they were able to move one foot after the
other every time they thought they were
safely away they would pass a great cater-
pillar gun or see the green netting that
covered a battery of snake-necked heavies
and know that they still were within reach
of enemy shells

  the column at last turned into some
woods and the order being given to fall out
the men fell out and down under the first
wet bush they saw and slept heavily
they slept until late in the afternoon and
then began to arise and clamor for food

  while supper and dinner combined was
being served men circulated through the
woods calling for members of the differ-
ent units and telling them where to report
to join their own organization infantry
machine-gunners and signal corps men were
all mixed up with each other and it would
be a difficult job to unscramble them again

  the first battalion to which nell be-
longed was in a farm a few hundred yards
down the road nell went there sadly
enough thinking of the men of his squad
and of what had happened to them the
man that had died the first day in the
woods spagett and the corporal in the
ditch goodrich nells captain the hard-
boiled man nell entered the farm and the
first man he saw was one who sat under a
shed bending over a brass  shell

  do i know you asked nell

  the other man looked up it was curran

  well hullo he cried so they didnt
get you either i seen you runnin around
like acrazy man boy i guess you an me
are the sole survivors of our old gang


adventure

golly all them guys gone just for a little
town an then we didnt get it after all
when did they bump off the captain
asked nell

  why they got him when we first started
out some guys were going to carry him
out but he says to leave him in a shell hole
so they left him an he props himself up
on a jerry knapsack an hollers you --
dont let me see you runnin away you
may think im out of it but if any man
starts to beat it hell find hes mistaken
i dont know what happened to him after
that because things got warm but he
stopped hollerin after a while an i guess
they croaked him

  i see you managed to save your vase
after all

 now aint that -cried curran

after all that trouble i took and bringin
it safe in an everythin an then last night
some great big mule-footed jughead goes an
tramps on it i think i can fix it though
he continued bending over the shell solici-
tously i cn put a block or somethin in
there an maybe pound the dent out of it
that way

  a man came out of one of the doors about
the farm yard and was going out the gate
when he noticed nell he stopped and
looked again and then came over to him

  ive been wondering about you said
the man i was beginning to be afraid
that the boche had gotten you after all

  it was the lieutenant that had led the last
dash into the town

  i guess they didnt get me sir said
nell grinning although i thought they
were going to once or twice in that town
how did your outfit make out asked
the lieutenant

  i guess theyre pretty well shot i was
just talking with curran here about the
captain

  why this mans in my battalion said
the officer in perplexity

  so am i said nell im out of g
company

  out of g company cried the officer
why i thought i knew all the lieutenants
in that company lets see theres noble
and trelawney and--

  im not an officer said nell sorely em-
barrassed im just a buck private

  the officer was speechless

  youre just a private he gasped
  thats all said nell

  an hes a john too spoke up curran
he just joined the night we went up

  the officers mouth shut like a trap
come with me said he and seizing
nells arm rushed him through the little
door into the farmhouse

  there was a table in there and a lot of
maps and papers and a mob of officers
sitting and standing the division com-
mander was making the rounds and this
was the p c of nells regiment

  the lieutenant shoved his way to the
table and saluted the white-mustached man
with the gold and the two stars on his over-
seas cap that sat there

  general said he youll pardon me for
interruption but i have just found the
officer i was telling you about hes the
man that led the counter attack and saved
us all from being wiped out he isnt an
officer hes just a private but he ought to
be one and so im going to recommend him
for a commission for gallantry in action
the general bent a lowering gaze on nell
hurrumphl said he write me a letter
about it put your recommendation through
channels and well see about it

  then he proceeded with his inspection of
a pile of papers

  meanwhile said the lieutenant as
they went out im in command of the
battalion we wont have any officer re-
placements until tomorrow when we get to
the railhead so youll command g com-
pany there are some corporals that youll
rank but you neednt mind that have your
company on the road by seven oclock

         nell had no trouble with his
company there werent many
more men there than he had had
in his platoon in the old regi-
ment a war strength company goes into
action with about two hundred and forty
men and nell had forty-eight survivors to
command the men accepted him without
question his uniform was creased and
dirty but still it was plainly tailor-made and
nells appearance and actions were such as
to command respect

  who the-is that guy asked some

  hes the guy that brung back the pa-
trol said others or hes the guy that led
the counter attack when we was gettin
ready to pull outta the wheat or if it
hadnt a been for him there wouldnt none
of us got out of that field
a sergeant of cavalry



  so throughout the night he led them and
no one fell out and no one tried to hop a
ride on a truck and when at the end of
the march nell led his forty-eight into a
barn and put them to sleep in the hay
without waiting to get permission to do
so they profanely allowed that he was the

best--officer they had ever met in all

their travels

  nell had marched in a daze all night a
commission for gallantry that was quite
a thing he didnt know yet how he liked
it it was like taking strange liquor one
had to wait until the kick came before giving
a decision on it

  i aint half as thrilled as i ought to be
decided nell

  he was still thinking about it as he made
up his bed in a horse stall he had ac-
quired some blankets and an overcoat from
a salvage pile and these were his coverings
there was a little window by the stall and
nell looked out of it for a minute

  huh he grunted in surprize

  there was a clattering of hoofs on a dis-
tant road and then the softj thud thud of
them on grass there was no moon but
the stars were out and nell could see a thick
clump of moving objects too tall for in-
fantry and too close together for artillery
going across the field behind the barn

  there was a succession of mournful crys
and the mass halted there was a rustle
of movement and then a confusion of soft
sound men called to each other com-
mands rang out there was the sound of
hammering on wood

  yessir cried nell thats an outfit
of cavalry and theyre puttin up a picket
line ill go look at em in the morning

  bugles awakened nell but he found they
were not the bugles of his regiment the
infantry were allowed to sleep late and
it was scarcely daylight the cool of a late-
summer morning with birds singing in the
trees old french women driving cows to
pasture and a bright blue sky overhead

  nell put on his shoes anyway for he
wanted to see what outfit that cavalry be-
longed to and it would be an hour before
his company would be turned out for rev-
eille down behind the barn he went
there was cavalry and no mistake with two
long picket lines the horses stamping and
kicking their tails waving and the air full
of hay that was being tossed down for their
breakfast

  

  the picket guard were putting on nose
bags and the horses nickered eagerly and
squealed and bit at each other in their im-
patience a man sang heaving forkfuls of
hay into the air

curry-comb and brush in the off-side pocket

on the nigh side picket pin an line

if your horse wont go for the proddin of the spur
then youll have to mix him up some turpentine

  nell choked that song was one of his
favorites the smell of hay was in his
nostrils and the smell of leather and of
horse and of bacon frying and no old
cavalryman can stand the combination
dry-eyed

  hey jerry called some one them
hard-tails o yours been fed yet better
get a move on

  nells ears began to sing and his heart
expanded so that it was difficult to breathe
he picked up a nose bag and examined it
though the picket guard eyed him suspi-
ciously on the bottom of it was stenciled
a pair of crossed sabres with the number 
above and the letter b below

  nell took a deep breath this was his
old regiment and if this picket line was b
troops the next must be a and that was
sergeant olsen calling to jerry daffinee the
wagon driver nell would have known his
voice had he heard it among those of the
entire regiment

  he went between two horses-old friends
too  and toodles which last
snapped his teeth at nells arm and then
flung his head high to escape the well-
merited slap that he feared was coming
but nell did not slap him he was looking
for his buddy

  oley he called

  the sergeant at the other end of the
picket line nearly leaped out of his clothes
and then made another leap that carried
him to nell

  what the - are you doin here

cried oley

  im with a doughboy outfit in the barrt
there we just come off the front

  ill say you did why dont you
shave

  never mind the shave ive been work-
in grinned nell wheres this gang of
jaspers going

  up to the front said oley just a and
b troops the old mans in command

  up to the front cried nell why when
did that happen


adventure

  we got the order about two days after
 you was gone we got off the train at
 chatter theery last night i told you you
 ought to stuck around why there was
 rumors about our goin before you had your
 brain-storm even

  what did the old man say when he
came back and found me gone

  to this sergeant olsen did not reply but
 inhaled his breath slightly as his eye wan-
 dered over nells shoulder

  i said you were a - fool said a

 voice

  nell swung about and beheld his former
 troop commander

  what the-was the matter with you

colburn asked the captain dont you
know you might have been hung for taking
that german out with you and why
didnt you wait until i came back before
you pulled out of camp that way

  i couldnt sir they shoved me in with
 that replacement outfit and away we went
 i just had time to get a pack carrier and a
 new rifle

  well did you get up to the front

  ill say i did said nell

  are you satisfied asked the captain
  ill say i am

  the captain turned to sergeant olsen
 how many spare horses have we
 seven sir said the sergeant

  how about equipment

  well terrio will have to turn in his hes
 going to hospital this morning

  we ought to have a man to ride one of
 those horses

  the captain looked at nell and then
walked away the sergeant nudged his
former comrade in the ribs

  yuh on kid yuh on he grinned

  it appears to me said nell soberly
 that the old man is incitin me to desert
 my outfit

  desert- this is your outfit come

 on eat breakfast is ready

nell thought a moment he
had another hour before his com-
pany would be up he might as
well eat with the boys anyway
he went up to the kitchen and a reception
was staged that was a bit uproarious the
stable sergeant would not allow nell to eat
a mouthful until he had taken him back to
the line and showed him his horse

  the top-sergeant tried to pump nell

 about the front but on that subject nell
 was as silent as a clam after breakfast
 nell went back to the picket line and leaned
 against the escort wagon while he and ser-
 geant olsen changed some bull durham
 into smoke

  goin with us asked the sergeant

  im afraid not said nell im afraid
not i got a company over there i got to
take care of

  a company

  yup a company they made me a looey
for some crazy stuff i did up on the lines

  did they make yuh or did they recom-
mend yuh to be made asked the sergeant
looking meaningly at nell

  they recommended me said nell

  oh said the sergeant

  nell thought on that for a while it was
one thing to be recommended and another
thing to be approved still it was worth
waiting to find out about

  well continued the sergeant i sup-
pose that was what you had in mind when
you got so all-fired eager to go up to the
front

  thats whatever agreed nell

  what shrieked the sergeant how
come

  do you mind that letter i got from
young duff that got sent to officers trainin
camp with me and got commissioned
well hes a first lieutenant now and if i
couldnt be a better soldier than he is id
put in for a transfer to the medical corps
and bein filled up with the swill the papers
pass out i thought the war was about over
an if i was goin to get a commission id
better get after it it was too late to go to
a trainin camp so the only way i knew of
was to get one for gallantry well to tell
you the truth i forgot all about it after a
while but i got it just the same

  nell colburn said the sergeant aghast
i always said that you wasnt right in the

head what the-s a commission in the

doughboys

  in b troop the man who had sung when
he put out the hay was still singing as he
took off the nose bags and piled them where
their owners could get them

id rather be a woodshed in my fathers back yard
than be a first lootenant in the national guard

oh tell me how long must i hes-o-tate

can i have you now or have i got to wait

  sounds reasonable remarked the ser-
geant
a sergeant of cavalry

i

  whos been ridin my horse asked
nell suddenly

  one o the johns said the sergeant
he dont take no kind o care o him

  he ought to be tried said nell

  the head of a column appeared at the
upper end of the picket line it was the
troop marching down to saddle up the
sergeant moved away to attend to the sad-
dling of his own mount he gave some
direction to one of the men who gathering
his saddle again followed the sergeant to a
different part of the line the troop saddled
and led out

  nell watched them with an aching heart
there were several things he would have
liked to correct-blankets on wrong side to
bits too far down in the mouth stirrups too
short he remembered his ignorance of
infantry tactics that he did not even know
how a grenade was fired

  this is the outfit i belong in said nell
to himself i know something about cav-
alry and all i know about infantry is that
it gets an awful rub when theres any
fightin to do

  still a commission was a commission
but what would he buy an outfit with

  all i need is a sam brown belt and a
pair o pins he thought

  good-by nell said the sergeant

  he had mounted and ridden up un-
noticed he bent down from the saddle
and shook hands a whistle blew and nell
could hear the trampling as the troops
moved out well a commission in the in-
fantry was better than a buck private even
in the cavalry

  so long said nell and started back to
his barn

  there were whistles blowing in the town
now and it was time the company was out of
the hay he turned for one last look at the
cavalry b troop was leading then a
then the escort wagons their khaki tops
swaying over the uneven ground there
was a knot of horsemen by the last wagon
evidently a rear guard then nell dis-
covered that there was a horse tethered to
a tree and left alone in the field

  hey called nell look at that horse
hey you left a horse

  the horse watching the departing troops
ran first one way about the tree and then
the other and finally nickered plaintively
nell stopped that horse looked like the
one he used to ride

  he never had that nickerin habit when
he was mine said nell i better untie
him an let him run hell catch up with
em

  he ran back to the tree and undid the
halter shank muttering his thought of the
man that would tie up a horse and then go
off and leave him

  beat it said nell waving his hand

  the horse however did not runbut came
close to nell and sniffed at the pocket where
nell used to carry his tobacco

 you knew me didnt you said
nell you old crow bait you cheat
the sausage-maker every day of your life
if i had a cigaret id give it to you
beat it now

  he turned the horses head in the direc-
tion the troops had gone but the horse
turned back this wasnt the first time he
and this man had been left when the others
went away the horse knew this was
to be a patrol an outpost or a picket and
after a while there would be a lot of fine
galloping with sugar and tobacco after it
was over the horse wasnt to be fooled
there he knew it the man had got into
saddle now for a good gallop

when nell came sliding up to
the rear guard he discovered it
was composed of the first ser-
geant the stable sergeant and
sergeant olsen

  there said olsen didnt i tell yuh
if i tied that old goat out there hed have
to come in make up your mind nell

  sure said nell a buck private of
cavalrys got em all beat clear up to
general

  all right privitl grinned the top ser-
geant bein as how you was late to forma-
tion you cn ride back here with us all day
an eat dust

  thereat there was great slapping of backs
and striking of hands and the rearguard
rode forward very merrily
mnmonay

he northeast trade blew strong
and steady blowing from the
anchorage in the lee of cayo
ingles directly toward the main-
land this latter was the north coast of
cuba the anchorage of cayo ingles lying
eighteen miles out from the seaport of cai-
mamtas eighteen miles alike as the barra-
cuda swims or the cargo lighters sail there
is no nearer anchorage or harbor suitable
for vessels of any size wherefore all cargo
coming into caimamtas must be lightered
in over that eighteen mile haul and all
export sugar must be lightered out

  this constitutes one of the many reasons
why the manager of the caribbean lines
branch office in caimamtas must be a man
of resource if he would hold his job

  at this particular time the freighters
carib prince and carib chieftan were the
sole occupants of the anchorage the former
loading sugar and the latter discharging
general cargo early in the afternoon the
last sling-loads of flour came out of the hold
of the latter ship and the two lighters lying
alongside prepared to start for shore
the gangs of stevedores boarded the launch
which chugged away toward the main-
land there was no tug in sight but the
steamer was ready to sail so the two light-
ers each manned by a patron and four
marineros cut loose from the carib chieftan

the weather being favorable the absence of
the tug made little difference as the lighters
rigged up big square tarpaulins as sails and
turned their blunt noses toward shore

  at dusk the lighter josefita had drawn a
little ahead of her consort and was nearing
the maze of small docks and warehouses
that constitute the caimamtas waterfront
in the dim light she resembled a viking
ship with her great square sail the heads of
a row of petroleum drums lying on their
sides completing the illusion by representing
the row of bersarks shields along the sea-
farers rail

  pancho urrutia was newly become patron
of the josefita this past week and his dig-
nity sat heavy upon him he took his
plate of tortilla and fried plantains a little
apart from the others as befitted one in
authority it seemed that the four mariner-
os under his command did not take this in
the right spirit

  is it that the deck is softer over
there panchito mio inquired one luis
raola

  this luis was an insolent fellow with no
sense of the fitness of things but pancho dare
not ask that he be discharged for was he
not a third cousin of senora urrutias own
mother pancho strove to think of the
things his wife would say at such an affront
to one of her kin but abandoned the task


medicinal methods



as being beyond him he allowed the
remark of luis to pass unnoticed as one
ignores the babbling of a child

  alfredo moreno looked up from the tiny
charcoal stove where he was busy transfer-
ring the last of the platanos fritos to his plate

  you are a fool luis he observed
do you not know that our patron has been
honored this day

  honored

  si el piloto the mate of the carib
chief tan asked him if he was an andaluz
the four went into paroxysms of mirth
for pancho was a gallego of northern spain
and gallego and andaluz are as near oil and
water as two branches of the same nation
can be pancho did not join in the laughter
it was a poor jest and showed how little is
needed to arouse the laughter of some

  in that there is nothing of humor he
observed severely

  he reached in his pocket and brought out
a square of some dark-brown substance

  you speak of el piloto my brave mari-
neros he said airily and well you may
see what he has given me-a piece of the
eating tobacco of the americans

  in the sudden silence which followed
pancho could feel the growing respect of the
others and he expanded under it

  el piloto and i we are close friends
he said we are men i gave him a bot-
tle of bacardi nothing more and he pre-
sented me with this he has promised to
teach me the boxing if we have time when
next his steamer comes to caimamtas
pancho looked straight at luis as he said
this and luis became greatly interested in
the soles of his canvas al par gates pancho
sliced off a large chunk of the plug and began
to chew

john okeefe had been many
things in this world before he
entered the employ of the carib-
bean line and was sent to cai-
mamtas as local manager he was of that
rare type of man which may spend long years
in the tropics without great loss of original
energy and vigor most mornings found
him afoot before five and all the native
employees of the line from the stevedores on
the ships to the carpinteros repairing the
two lighters hauled out on the beach
worked under the disquieting realization
that eljefe was more than likely to material-
ize from nothing at all at any time

  they still tell the tale of how in the early
days of okeefes regime a certain gang of
half a dozen of the dock laborers decided
that there was no harm in their taking a
quiet siesta in the middle of the afternoon
and of how their disillusionment was great
and sudden

  these characteristics made okeefe of
great value to the line and his worth was
further enhanced by his ability to get along
well with his native subordinates and with
the local merchants and his perfect com-
mand of spanish as spoken in cuba for
the rest he drank but sparingly was scru-
pulously honest and was a man of great and
varied resourcefulness

  okeefe was sitting at his desk in the one-
story building that served as both office and
residence reading a week-old new york
newspaper he was waiting word of the
arrival of the lighters bringing in the general
cargo from the carib chief tan and had just
begun to wonder why they were delayed
when there came hasty footsteps outside
then the door burst open and don pancho
urrutia entered

  to simply say that pancho entered is to
give an entirely false impression as he cer-
tainly could not have done so alone and un-
assisted his face was a greenish gray
his head hung forward his knees bent under
him if he had not been supported by the
strong arm of that prince among men his
wifes own cousin luis raola he would
surely have fallen okeefe hurled aside
his chair and crossed the office in three
strides

  que pasa he snapped

 senor moaned pancho el padre
should be sent for i die and a paroxysm
shook him

  okeefe ceased to look for a knife wound
and surveyed the mess pancho had made
of the clean tiles of the office floor for a
moment he thought of a similar incident in
his boyhood an incident closely connected
with some very green apples inspiration
came to him for panchos swaying to and
fro had made the plug of chewing tobacco
fall from his pocket to the floor okeefe
was about to tell pancho that he was no
nearer death than millions of people have
been after their first attempt to chew the
weed but on second thought he changed his
mind it was one of okeefes character-
istics that he sometimes followed devious
ways to an end he stepped forward and


adventure

felt the stricken mans pulse and looked
keenly into his face

  enrique the dock superintendent
who had come up with the others started as
okeefe barked his name

  go back there and get the small leather
box that lies on the table in my room
en seguida

  as enrique disappeared into okeefes
quarters at the back of the office the latter
turned to pancho

  it is of a very great sadness amigo
he said but you have the cholera

  cholera madre de dios luis let go
of pancho who collapsed in a heap on
the floor and made a leap for the door
okeefe dived for his knees and brought
him down in a perfect flying tackle it
did not suit his purpose to have luis start
a panic in the town by spreading news of
cholera

  pancho lay huddled on the floor groaning
rhythmicaly and feelingly after every tenth
or twelfth groan he called on the saints in a
few brief but heartfelt words luis re-
gained his power of speech which had been
knocked out of him by his sudden and un-
expected fall

  but senor it is necessary that i seek
d medico i have been much with that-
that poor one

  el medico can not save you they say
that for cholera there is no cure

  okeefe paused a moment to let this
sink in and heard the footsteps of the re-
turning enrique he spoke hastily

  say nothing to enrique in the box
he brings i have drugs that will save
you

  taking his medicine chest from enrique
okeefe mixed a dose of ordinary bicarbon-
ate of soda to soothe the tortured stomach
of pancho and prepared a foul-tasting
laxative for luis when the men left the
office a little later they were both convinced
that okeefe had not only saved their lives
but had averted an epidemic he had
gained two firm friends who might be useful
at a later date

  they were sufficiently grateful to obey
his request to keep the incident to them-
selves though occasionally they dropped
dark hints of some secret they shared with
el jefe

  this lent them a certain distinction such
as that which attaches to a privy coun-
cillor or the especial favorite of a potentate

ethe months passed and okeefe
might perhaps have forgotten the
incident had not the grateful
pancho mentioned it at intervals
december came and with it the start of the
grinding season in february and march
with the giant rollers turning in every
sugar mill in the island and with thousands
of bags of new raw sugar being turned out
for export every day the anchorage in the
lee of cayo ingles was always occupied by
a number of steamers loading outward

  okeefe took his sleep when he could get
it a few hours at a time and ate his meals
standing at the counter of some native
cantina or else with the officers of some ship
at the anchorage from january to april
life at an important cuban seaport is very
different from the rest of the year for
everything goes at fever heat when he
really wants to the latin can shed his
indolence for a fierce nervous energy and
he does it at that time of year it is then
that the money is made in cuba the rest of
the year is spent in marking time until the
next busy season

  okeefe shoved aside the bunch of re-
ports he had been attempting to complete
and lighted his pipe for one final smoke to
steady his nerves before turning in for a few
hours pancho stepped quietly in at the
door

  buenos noches senor he said hesitantly

  well responded okeefe wondering
sleepily what had brought the patron of
the josefita to him at that hour of the
night

  the senor once saved my life continued
pancho his tone slightly firmer don
pancho urrutia does not forget favors
i have news for the senor news of moment
tomorrow night the union of los estibadores
will strike

  sleep dropped from okeefe in an instant
a strike of the stevedores coming at the
height of the season would be a disaster
that would cost the line thousands of dol-
lars he relighted his pipe and began to
walk to and fro the length of the office

  about nine the next morning with four
hours work already behind him okeefe
boarded the launch caribette and headed
for the anchorage two of his pockets
bulged with unusual weight a couple of
hours later the launch drew up alongside
the carib warrior and okeefe went up the
jacobs-ladder he glanced into all holds
medicinal methods



with a critical eye for the stowage of the
sugar bags had a few words with the chief
tally clerk and the mate and then walked
quietly aft to the poop

  the eighteen miles separating cayo
ingles from the mainland make it impossible
to bring the stevedores ashore every night
and they remain on board a steamer the
whole time she is loading they sling their
hammocks in the tween decks in the poop
or in the bridge-space and they bring a cook
with them okeefe found the cook of the
gang working the carib warrior asleep
on the poop beside his charcoal stove and
the big wooden box containing the dishes
and food supplies

  what desires eljefe inquired the aged
cook starting to get to his feet

  do not rise don pedro said okeefe
courteously i would talk he sat down
on the edge of the box have you not
told me many times of your old home in
the mountains of cataluna don pedro
si senor it is my desire to end my
days there there are no mountains like
those of cataluna

  have you not saved nearly enough
money to enable you to return

  indeed senor i have saved but little
but i have nephews there in cataluna
with whom i could live if i brought a little
money with me

  okeefe thought a moment

  are you a man of discretion don
pedro he asked there then followed
some low-voiced conversation the outcome
of which appeared to satisfy both men

  shortly afterward okeefe boarded the
carib queen which was a sister ship of the
carib warrior they were the largest of
the half a dozen steamers then in the an-
chorage big freighters of about six thousand
torts deadweight and thirty odd stevedores
were employed on each as soon as he
reached the deck okeefe summoned the
president of the union one julio romero
this romero was large fat dirty and more
than half negro but not a man to be un-
derestimated okeefe went to the point
at once

  is it true that you strike tonight
romeros wide mouth hung open with
surprize

  who told you of la liuelga he de-
manded

  that is of no importance is it
true

  alas romero was the picture of
sorrow at the need for grieving his friend
the american

  la huelga it is of a necessity we have
debated it much i myself fought against
it with great vigor but at last my com-
rades made me see that it is indeed of a
necessity

  where is the necessity

  we are poor senor we must buy rice
for our families and clothing---

  this is foolishness broke in okeefe
your pay is better than that of any men
doing work of a similar nature throughout
the island

  el jefe does not understand does he
know what we must pay for the houses we
live in

  eight pesos a month

  does he realize what prices of an exor-
bitance we must pay for food and clothing
romero continued blandly does he
realize how much we must give to the
priest for the saving of our souls we
grieve but we strike tonight

  okeefe gave up trying to appeal to the
others sense of fairness and walked away
when romero had returned to the hold
he sought the bridge space the steve-
dores had been sleeping there and their
hammocks hung in rows but the place was
deserted at this time okeefe only re-
mained a moment

  at about a quarter to eleven okeefe
turned from the rail where he had been
leaning to find the excited chief tally clerk
at his elbow

  oiga jefe the cook can not find his
stove how shall we eat

  what happened to it

  who knows senor it was left in there
with our hammocks and now it is gone
perhaps el diablo took it but of a certainty
it is gone

  then do you go over to the carib
warrior there is food enough there for
all

  when the launch caribette returned from
taking the stevedores over to the other
steamer okeefe shouted down to keep
the motor idling he leaned against the
rail gazing fixedly at the carib warrior
with an air of expectancy the minutes
went by and he remained motionless
suddenly he grunted turned from the rail
hastily climbed down into the launch and
headed toward shore


adventure

the inroad of stevedores from
the other vessel had at first
caused consternation on board
the carib warrior they were
the two largest steamers in the anchorage
and their combined gangs comprised about
a third of the whole personnel of the union
incidentally all the officers and leaders of
the union were among them

  but don julio protested the chief
tally clerk of the carib warrior as the
president of the union climbed aboard
the old one will not have prepared enough
food for so many

  then shall we eat first as having to
return to the other steamer

  an angry murmur greeted this announce-
ment but it was stilled by the piping voice
of the old cook announcing that he had
enough ready to feed everybody the tally-
clerk was minded to reprove him for his
extravagance in cooking so much but for-
got it in the rush for plates

  some twenty minutes later romero
shoved away his plate on which there still
remained some rice with a vague but un-
mistakable feeling of unrest he lighted a
cigaret but discarded it a moment later the
smoke tasting stale in his mouth his
disquiet increased and he sat down heavily
on the hatch combing resting his head in
his hands hearing a low moan a few
minutes later he raised his head and saw
one of the tally-clerks lying on the deck his
head sticking out over the steamers side
a racking cough shook the tally clerk
romero joined him hastily

  the officers of the carib warrior were
asmuch at a loss to explain the strange
malady which had gripped all the steve-
dores as the victims themselves they
herded them all into the forward well-deck
where they lay prone and groaning the
men on the lighters lying alongside sensed
the excitement on board the steamer and
don pancho of the josefita climbed up to
investigate he was met at the rail by the
first and second mates

  heres another one said the shorter of
the two has he got it

  if he hasnt already he probably will
have answered the other

  right said the first forrard with
him

  panchos curious questions were cut
short by an affront to his dignity that left
him spluttering in incoherent fury the

two americans grasped him under the arm-
pits and lifted him off his feet they carried
him bodily forward and dropped him gently
down onto the broad back of the recumbent
romero

  pancho stood up and surveyed the deck
wonderingly of the sixty odd men who
formed the combined gangs of the two
steamers not one was able to stand
panchos questions got no answer panchos
sympathy received no acknowledgment
as he stood there wondering he thought of
a night the previous summer a night when
only the almost magical skill of el jefe had
stood between him and the grave

  oye don julio said pancho i know
what sickness this is i have had experi-
ence in such things it is cholera

  then are we all dead men groaned the
stricken romero

  no cried pancho excitedly there
is yet a chance see the launch he
pointed to the caribette which was passing
the ship on her way toward shore let
us wave to el jefe that he may come and
pancho hastily related the incident when he
himself pancho urrutia of the josefita
had been at deaths door and had been
saved by the american

  he ran to the bulwark and commenced
to wave his hat pale weakened men
staggered to their feet and lurched to his
side joining pancho in his efforts to attract
okeefes attention there were a few
agonized moments when it seemed that the
launch was not going to stop and then the
caribette swung around in a wide circle
and headed for the ship

  when okeefe came aboard pancho in-
terspersed his questions as to whether he
had with him the little leather box with
apologies for having revealed a thing el
jefe had told him to keep secret and ex-
planations that the greatness of the emer-
gency had seemed to justify it romero
heaved himself to his feet and stood there
swaying

  have you that little box of leather of
which pancho speaks he demanded of
okeefe

  i have the box answered the latter
slowly but i dont know if i should give
you any of the medicine the drug is a
secret one very rare and the only cure for
cholera if i save all of you there will be
none left in case the epidemic starts on
shore it may be wiser to let you die
medicinal methods



then you can be buried out here and the
drug can be saved to prevent an epidemic
in the city

  faced by this sunny prospect julio
romero rose to heights of eloquence that
he had never before attained and it was
his oratory that had elevated him to the
presidency of the union he spoke of all
that they had done for okeefe and the
well beloved compania in the past he
mentioned the sorrowing wives and children
of the men thus condemned to death he
even offered okeefe the sum of a hundred
or so pesos that was in the treasury of the
union when he had almost despaired of
ever melting that hardest of hearts okeefe
suddenly said--

  very well i will cure all of you if you
will sign this paper

  what paper is that romero glanced
suspiciously at the document okeefe had
taken from his pocket

  an agreement to call off the proposed
strike and to have no strikes or similar
troubles during the rest of the year
romero tried to evade the issue-

  the whole union is not here

  all the officials are here if you and
these others sign and you give me a note
to the rest i can get the signatures of the
men on the other ships

  although the astute romero was very
sick he felt that something was wrong he
did not like the business he very distinctly
smelled a rat but the fear of death was
on him and the others were crying out for
him to sign so he took the proffered pen
and affixed his scrawling signature to the
document

  as each man signed he was given a drink
from the bucket of water into which okeefe
had emptied one of the bottles from his
medicine case and was told to sit down and
keep still okeefe left them seated in
long rows on the deck and told the mate
to have the chief tally clerk turn them to
later in the afternoon if they seemed suf-
ficiently recovered

two days later okeefe was
making up the months general
statement for the accounting de-
partment of the home office at
the end he added together the amounts of
a couple of slips from the drug store of
doctor brutel for the purchase of a large
quantity of a strong emetic a personal re-

ceipt signed in a crooked old-fashioned
hand with the name of the man who had
been cook for the union and a bill for a
new charcoal stove he wrote the item
special expenses   and looked
at it critically wondering how many letters
he would have to write before the home
office was finally satisfied with the correct-
ness of the item at that moment julio
romero walked in okeefe quietly turned
the accounts face down and leaned back in
his chair

  you wish to see me don julio he
asked

  the carib warrior has just finished load-
ing and we are come ashore

and are you all completely recovered
we are of such a healthfulness that it is
difficult to believe that we were ever taken
with the deadly cholera replied romero
suddenly

  it pleases me greatly to learn of it
responded okeefe courteously and waited
for the others next move romero changed
his ground

  the signing of that agreement pleases
you greatly verdad

  okeefe shrugged his shoulders

  i was not worried the wages and
hours are fair and there was no reason for a
strike i feel sure that your sense of fair-
ness would have prevented a strike at the
last moment even if no agreement had been
signed

  romero digested this in his heart he
admitted the truth of the first part of what
okeefe had said and he saw no point in
taking exception to the rest at this time
he fired his last shot-

  that old one who cooked for us that day
he came ashore with you in the launch
being old he did not recover as quickly
as the rest of you i brought him ashore
for more medicine

  but i just came from his home and he
is not there my heart goes out to the old
one in his sickness and i would visit him
unfortunately he will be deprived of
that pleasure don pedro has taken ship
to return to his old home in spain

  romeros eyes grew black with rage and
the first words of a string of profanity came
tumbling from his lips but suddenly he
smiled julio romero was in most ways
an unmitigated rascal but he could also be
a good loser

  may god prosper his journey he said

sudden shifting of the wind at
midnight saved the gin and cot-
ton house but all cord-wood ricks
were doomed

  bain made his plans before dawn when
the sky-sweeping glare of the burning was at
its height and he stood among his fas-
cinated negro hands watching the seasoned
wood go-six hundred cords of it

  willie thompson his negro foreman
stood at his elbow

  cap wes cleaned plumb out

  looks like it willie

  the plantation manager was laconic
living cut off from men of his race and
status of education there was more to
think than to say

  what is we gwine to do wes got
eighty-five bales done picked out an evry
pen an stall on dis planation full an fifteen
bales piled in de field we is bleedged to
run de gin

  willie said bain thoughtfully have
six wagons ready by daylight with the wood
frames on see that one has a box bed on
it to carry axes and saws and log chains
at daylight remember

  fo-mule teams or two-mule teams
mistuh bain

  two well cut in laconia circle by
the mound theres lots of good hack-
berry and oak there

  yessuh

  the plantation manager was a firm man
but just he could think of no one black
or white who had cause to do him harm
yet no reasoning man after going over the
ground could doubt the incendiary origin
of the fire which evidently had been meant
to include the gin and cotton house in its
midnight meal

  well he mused if the wind hadnt
shifted his scheme would have worked if i
ever find out-

       an interesting area lies
in the angle made by the con-
gpgjm fluence of the white and the
mississippi river in the lower
end of phillips county arkansas years
ago levees were run along the banks of the
two rivers but the unruly waters of coffee
creek and bee bayou both tributary to
white river had a habit of coming in on
the planters from above to stop this an-
other levee was built one end of this new
embankment joined the old mississippi river
levee and the other tied into the white
river levee the system of protective
levees as a whole formed a huge circular
dyke many miles in circumference-laco-
nia circle

  within the circle the dead-level of over-
flow delta land is broken but in one place


o

adventure

near the very center in the lowest part on
dupree lake stands the indian mound

  the mound is the work of aboriginal
americans no arrow-heads pottery or
fragments of human bones are found there
it is not a burial mound the supposition
is that it was built as a refuge from over-
flows a perfect chocolate-drop in shape it
rises to a height of fifty feet and is nearly
three hundred feet in diameter at the base
the slope thickly studded with hackberry
trees has a sharp slant the top is the high-
est land within a radius of forty-two miles

  against the hackberry trees in particu-
lar bain led his wood-cutting expedition
hackberry wood is hard dense and heavy
it splits beautifully has few limbs to clear
off and burns more readily when green than
other woods

  twenty-two men besides the manager
arrived at the foot of indian mound at
eight-thirty on the morning of november
sixteenth the mules were taken from the
wagons and tied to saplings axes saws
mauls and wedges were distributed in ten
minutes the woods were ringing with cheer-
ful activities

  most of the men had been with bain for
years he passed among them silent for
the most part but watchful encouraging
and helpful a good boss with a good crew
three or four transient day hands were
among the workers one a ginger-bread-
colored negro of gigantic size particularly
attracted bains attention where and un-
der what circumstances had he seen that
mans villainous face before

  he hunted up willie thompson who jus-
tified his position as straw boss by doing
two mens work he was determined to ease
his curiosity regarding the stranger how-
ever willie began talking about the stage of
the mississippi-an absorbing subject just
now-and bain forgot all else

  cap is she gwine to make us trouble
wouldnt be surprized fall overflows
-when they do come-are tricky i talked
long distance to helena yesterday the gage
is forty-five feet there and the crest not due
to pass memphis till tonight

  is dey done fixed dat bee bayou cre-
vasse yet mistuh bain

  the manager did not answer at once
no he said slowly they havent
theyve piled fresh dirt in the break but
they didnt allow for settling it would
melt like sugar the-jack-legs

  and after a pause

  willie i wouldnt talk about high water
to the boys too much were in low coun-
try you know

  nawsuh i wont will you please suh
send uncle mote green heah to file my
saw

  at noon bain took his lunch-a cold
banquet forced upon him by aunt jane his
devoted but imperious old cook-and sat
down on a log by dupree lake to eat

  weak november sunshine had lured
several mud-turtles out and with extended
necks two of these creatures from their
perch on a slanting snag inspected the big
planter bain polished off the drum-stick
of the fried chicken he was eating and de-
liberately hurled the bone at the turtles
both of which tumbled immediately into the
murky water the manager held up in
transit a piece of chocolate cake and stared
at the commotion made by the plunge
instead of widening uniformly in concentric
rings the splashes had spread to the right
in distorted ripples either he was drunk
delirious or crazy or dupree lake was
running

  even as he watched there came an omi-
nous quiver in the dark waters and a deep
cattle track near the margin suddenly filled
leaves and bits of dry grass floated and spun
about in the depression bain sprang to
his feet the fearful truth hammering at his
brain before he could turn dupree lake
rose bodily three feet and a swirl of choco-
late-colored mississippi river water dis-
placed the quiet brown of its placid surface
what thirty seconds before had been a quiet
cypress break was now a violent maelstrom
of seething tawny flood water

  willie get the teams on the mound
and see if all the men are here

  bain rushed to the base of indian mound
shouting orders as he ran the hands were
huddled together scared stiff even willie
was paralyzed

  here yelled the manager get those
mules untied-quick

  he whipped out his pocket knife and flew
at the halter ropes willie and the drivers
followed the animals were now wild with
panic and plunged away on the homeward
road as soon as liberated ignoring the sanc-
tuary of the mound

  cut em loose sos they can swim get
the gear off-dont try to hold em

  all but one team were freed when a
flood



warning roar above which hung a whispering
hiss of mad waters swept down from the
north

  run yelled bain here robert-
get

  boss i cant leave em heah to drown
whined the black boy this is  tony
anjoe

  its them or you-run

  he flung the driver bodily back from the
mules water swirled up to their knees as
they sprang for the mound the frantic
team snapped their hitch ropes and en-
cumbered by clanking gear splashed after
the other animals floundering belly-deep in
the rising flood

  between the moment bain had tossed his
chicken bone at the turtles and the one in
which he and robert dripping and pant-
ing floundered up the mounds slope pos-
sibly twenty minutes had passed in that
time the great saucer of laconia circle had
been filled with chocolate-colored water to
an average depth of fifteen feet from
indian mound outward in any direction
water shut the wood cutters in as the
crow flies it was seven and a half miles to
any dry land other than that upon which
they stood

  they were dazed as men are who have
beheld a miracle of destruction come on the
wing of an instant and who have missed
death by seconds

  it wont come much higher boys shes
busted through that new bee bayou fill
itll back up a little more but not much

  the manager spoke evenly in his usual
impersonal tone his manner heartened
the negroes as nothing else could

  lawdy lawdy exclaimed uncle john
key jes think where wed a been if
we hadnt a been nigh dis heah mount

  the old man a hardwood timberman of
fifty years experience let his eyes wander
over the murky water in which the giant
red gums and oaks stood knee deep he
lowered his ax from his shoulder and leaned
upon its handle bain looked at him and
came near smiling

  uncle john you didnt lose your ax
anyhow

 suh nawsuh any time i throws
down my ax you kin know is dead

  well its lucky was bains grim com-
ment have you ever rafted logs uncle
john

  manys de time i rafted jes below

newpot an at augusty too man an
boy i made rafs bout twenty year

  bain ran an appraising eye over the
growth of hackberry trees on the mound

  how will they do for a raft uncle
john

  dem the old darkey chuckled con-
descendingly hack-a-berry aint no good
fo dat hit wont float mistuh bain
hit sho wont

  you mean to tell me it wont float
  you jes watch heah

  with four calculated slow but effective
strokes of his razor-keen ax the old woods-
man felled a six-inch sapling from it he
cut a billet fireplace length this he lifted in
his stringy old black arms and flung in the
water it did not bob up as wood should
it was gone

  -- muttered bain

  nawsuh uncle john laughed proudly
at the success of his demonstration hit
sho wont float when hits green hit
sometimes floats jes a little bit under de
water but hit wont bear up no weight
the manager perceived that escape from
indian mound might be harder than he had
supposed he left uncle john and joined
the other men who were clustered about a
fire which had been lighted on top of the
mound

  all right boys he called curtly lets
get up some firewood for tonight

  even enforced loafing rubbed the nap of
bains disposition the wrong way the
men sprang up cheerfully four or five
axes had been saved while some felled
and split hackberry saplings others carried
the fuel to the top of the mound already
the sun was below the majestic cypresses of
dupree lake and a tang of frost mingled
with the earthy smell of miles of muddy
water a v of wild geese shot across the
red west going south

bain had the wood piled in a
hollow square open on the south-
ern side some of the older men
under uncle john key he as-
signed to making a bed of leaves inside the
wind-break thus provided

  cap asked willie thompson just as
darkness shut down upon indian mound
is we gwine to ever git offn heah

  i ought to be able to figure out some
way willie

  onliest thing-you knows how niggers


adventure

is bout they grub how is we gwine to
do

  well eat what the little boy shot at
it wont kill us to miss a feed or two what
we need now is rest well see tomorrow

  yessuh

  willie knew as well as he knew his name
that they were in desperate straits but
when bain spoke reassuringly the black
man couldnt help feeling-in spite of fact
and reason-that all was well

  long as mistuh bains at my back he
put it is all right

  after the camp had settled bain moved
from the shelter of the wind-break and de-
scended to the waters edge the flood was
rising but slowly having filled laconia
circle to the level of the river

  a splash attracted the managers atten-
tion he stood perfectly still and saw a
small dark form approach along the margin

   possum he rightly conjectured and
as the animal which was looking at the
fire above came near bain literally fell
upon it

  the struggle was brief breakfast for
several men was assured

  he carried his quarry to camp and woke
the foreman

  willie weve got to rustle some grub
therell be other varmints swimming in to
the mound tonight when the fire burns
lower wake three or four good men and
place em around the edge of the water with
clubs tell em to keep still and watch
close

  yessuh dis one sho is fat an fine
robert oh bob he stirred the driver
with his toe git joe an channy an
willis green an come on

  groaning and yawning the night brigade
was deployed by the merciless willie bain
sat down-for the first time since noon-
and prepared to get what sleep he could
as he dozed off a falling brand stirred the
fire to a sudden fierce brightness the
passing flare revealed the circle of dusky
sleepers and bain saw plainly the broad
malignant face of the strange negro over
whose identity he had puzzled all day
slanting downward across the mans right
temple ran the livid wale of a four-inch
scar

  a chill bleak dawn came muffled in
clinging fog the camp-fire had been re-
plenished through the night and now as
man after man rose yawning from his place

it was heaped high with limbs and brush
above through fog-rifts could be seen
monotonous gray clouds hurrying south-
ward below swirling wisps of vapor al-
ternately revealed and obscured the dark
tree trunks and crept upward from the dull
water like ghosts of drowned things it
was decidedly colder with every indication
of bitter weather to come

  bains night hunters had done well be-
sides the possum captured by the manager

there were four large swamp rabbits four
possums and one coon there was no
immediate danger of starvation

after breakfast bain set the
firewood squad to work and made
a thorough survey of the mound
just at the waters edge on the
northern slope he saw what appeared to be
several pieces of fence plant embedded in
the earth curiosity impelled he made
examination he found a dilapidated flat
boat the corner which had first attracted
his attention was all of it above water and
six inches of sediment lay in that the
bulk of the ancient barge lay down the slope
of indian mound under water and most
probably deep in mud	

  bain now remembered that the barge had
been swept from the river six years before
since then no overflow had broken into the
circle-until the present one the barge
had been towed there by two disappointed
negro trappers whose hope of reward was

blasted when no owner could be located

  willie hallooed the manager and be-
gan to kick up leaf mold near the planks
with the toes of his boots

  they towed it in he muttered there
ought to be a good length of chain

  you call me mistuh bain

  yeah heres that barge michael and
joe towed in when the levee broke before
help me find the chain maybe we can do
something with it

  together they tore up the loose earth with
sticks their finger nails and boot toes the
chain was finally unearthed it had once
been strong and was still heavy it was
coated with the rust of six years exposure
they followed it up digging it loose as they
went the landward end was padlocked
around the base of a small tree

   bout fifteen foot of hit willie com-
mented reckon dat ol boats any good
mistuh bain

  it wont have to be very good to beat
starving on this mound willie this chains
too short for what i had in mind its rusty-
rotten too

  kin us git her out cap

  we can try about how far off is the
wagon thats got our tools and chains in it
not so overly-bout fifty foot from de
edge of where de water is now but cap
dat waters fifteen foot deep there now
bain grunted he was thinking hard as
they hastened back to camp

  boys said the manager after the dis-
covery had been announced if we can get
our chains out of the tool wagon i believe
we can drag that old boat out it must be
pretty rotten but theres mighty little cur-
rent in this back water and maybe its a
chance anyway we cant do better than
try

  boss ill dive fo dat wagon if you says
so volunteered channy hit aint so
overly cold-yet

  you couldnt do any good channy a
man dont have any luck bringing up a
log chain is there any rope or staging-
even string will help-in your pockets
two of the men had each a ball of strong
cotton cord

  i meant to set me a trot-line in dupree
lake whilst we wuz heah one of them ad-
mitted sheepishly but i guess de fishes is
all done drownt by now

all right now twist those lines to-
gether-that chain weighs something

uncle john cut us three good forks for
grab-hooks well bind em together your
hackberry wont float maybe we can use it
in another way

  boss some one suggested aint us
liable to hang on to de wagon wheels or
stay-chains an lose our hook an line

  i thought of that who knows exactly
where the wagon is

  several chorused-

  i does

  how do you know challenged the
manager

  i driv hit asserted channy dats
why i said id dive fo hit i remembers hit
was under dat big oak juss under de spread-
in limb wid de tongue pintin north an
south

  can you swim out there with the hook
johns making and drop it about in the
wagon-box

  yessuh i knows i can

  well get ready john lemme your
forks anybody got an old pocket knife or
something for a sinker

  mote green the saw filer had several
heavy files bain selected the two smooth-
est and least useful

  mote take good care of the others we
may need em he said as he bound the flat
oblongs of steel to one shank of the impro-
vised grappling-hook he then notched
the shank and binding the three forks to-
gether looped the line which had been
twisted securely around it

  all set channy

  yessuh niggers gimme room an pile
de fiah is cold now an gittin mo so bref
by bref

  stark naked his knotty muscles lumping
under the mellow brown of his skin the
driver paced down the slope bain handed
him the wooden hook and himself held the
line

  dont dive in channy-may be a sunk
log or something

  br-r-r-r lawdy have mercy
splashing in waist deep the boy fell on
his breast and literally churned the muddy
water he circled under the limbs of the
oak got his bearings shouted for slack on
the line and let go

  come in yelled bain feeling the line
settle channy came-with the noise and
speed of a water-spout not pausing until he
was wallowing in the leaves two feet from
the giant log-heap


adventure

  gradually bain took up slack on the line
tense and breathless the dark crescent of
faces focused upon the water

  the hook caught by a miracle as it
seemed to them the chain was grappled at
the first trial they fell over one another
helping to drag it out

  look yonder shouted channy from the
top of the mound pointing toward the oak

  freed of the chain the wagon-body had
floated out of the rocking bolster it now
drifted just flush with the surface of the
water the chain had been landed bain
coiled the line carefully it was an easy
cast but he took no chances the weighted
hook fell squarely in the wagon-bed and
again all hands hauled in with a will

  they thought only of the good planking
in the bed but securing it meant much more
an ax a hatchet a coil of rope a small
sodden paper bag of precious tenpenny
nails and a hammer were found inside it
took the united effort of them all to haul
their prize ashore and tilt the ton or more of
water out

  bain scratched his head that barge
was many times bigger and heavier than
this and stuck in the mud besides well
theyd see

  uncle john you and willie and robert
go over this bed and make it water-tight
it oughtnt to leak much after soaking that
long well use it for a boat itll come in
handy in raising the barge

  yessuh you niggers give us some shirt-
tails an rags an things to plug hit wid

  by nailing the tail-gate in and caulking
a small crack here and there the wagon-bed
was converted into a very serviceable boat
then bain called another general assembly

  boys only about six men can ride in
the wagon-box safely and thered be some
danger of it swamping even at that heres
what well do well get everything ready
do what we can today and pull that old
barge out tomorrow if she aint too rotten
to patch up shell carry us all-would carry
as many again for that matter but if shes
too rotten youll draw lots and five of you
go for help in the wagon-box

in the remaining hours of day-
light wood was cut the under-
brush cleared from around the
landward end of the barge and
a successful hunting voyage undertaken in
the newly acquired boat a number of

animals were found adrift on logs or ma-
rooned in tree tops and hollow trees
chilled starving and with the last hypnotic
stage of death-fright on them they were
readily clubbed or brought down with heavy
throwing sticks there was no shortage of
meat for supper

  this and the hope inspired by the suc-
cesses of the day made the campers more
cheerful than they had been since the com-
ing of the flood drugged by hard work
and by the huge quantities of hot unsalted
meat the negroes soon settled in their
places about the fire bain had superin-
tended hunting the night before he lay
down with the earliest

  just before he fell asleep the giant negro
who had before excited his curiosity came
over and respectfully accosted him

  cap is you sleep

  what is it

  if you wants huntsmens fo tonight me
an dem three boys will go

  no get your rest theres stuff enough
for two days cool as it is we want every-
body ready for hard work in the morning

  yessuh

  the man seemed disappointed bain
fell asleep puzzling over it why should
any one wish to splash around in the dark
of a cold night after coons and rabbits
when he might be curled up warmly by the
fire

  he was awakened to receive just the in-
formation needed to answer his question
a hand grasped his shoulder and shook it
nervously

  mistuh bain oh mistuh bain

  all right uncle john the manager
was a light sleeper in the instant of regain-
ing consciousness he had recognized john
keys voice although the old timberman
spoke in a low excited whisper

  boss some niggers is aimin to steal de
wagon-box an skip dey done put all de
meat most in it and de quile of rope

  bain instantly arose and without noise
descended to the landing four figures
were moving about in the dark near where
the wagon-bed had been secured

  all right he barked through the gloom
get that stuff out and back where it be-
longs i give you one minute to get
started

  the surprize was complete the au-
thority of the voice had instantaneous effect
crest-fallen the deserters began to unload
flood



their cargo with nervous haste bain stood
perfectly still in the spot from which he had
issued his orders

  get to camp he directed when the
work of returning the stolen goods was
completed

  he followed the men closely and as they
came into the light of the fire he noted the
identity of each one was the big scar-
faced negro who had volunteered as a
hunter he shot a malignant look at bain
which revived the vague memory of a pre-
vious encounter the other three were day
hands bain expected no especial loyalty
from any of them the incident was closed
so far as he was concerned

  before going to sleep he woke willie
thompson

  willie he explained as the big fellow
strove piteously with sleep that big scar-
faced nigger and those three boys to his left
tried to skip with the wagon-bed and grub
put a guard over the boat if they make
just one more move like that well hang
them

  he spoke very quietly but so that all who
were awake could hear no one doubted
that he meant exactly what he said

  yessuh channy an mell take keer of
em and de boat boss

  willie was now wide awake when the
manager had seen him rout out channy he
curled up in his nest of leaves three yards
distant from the thwarted deserters and
slept peacefully until daylight

  it was a heroic program which bain
planned for himself and his men the follow-
ing day and immediately after an unappetiz-
ing all-meat breakfast they charged into it

  the sheer power needed to haul the sunk-
en mud-loaded barge from the water and
up the slope of the mound would be enor-
mous but this force-presuming they
could apply it-must be used with judg-
ment and extreme care the weathered
timbers of the old flat-boat were none too
stanch bain did not dare hitch his chain
to any member of the barge itself

  all right uncle john cut us a six-
inch sapling as long as this old scow is wide
inside and hew it flat on two sides ander-
son you and abram help him alex you
and paxton make us some pegs out of pin-
oak make em about an inch through
and eight inches long round em up with
your pocket knife

  bain himself climbed into the corner of

  

the barge which rested above water and
carefully measured the distance from center
to center of the longitudinal beams which
stiffened its bottom

  about two feet and theres eight of

em the-things about fourteen feet

wide

  when the timber had been prepared by
old john and his helpers it was laid across
these bottom beams and marks made on its
upper surface to correspond with the centers
of the beams below a rusted iron rod was
found in the barge itself and this with one
of the tail-gate rods from the wagon bed
was heated in a fire kindled near-by

  while some of the men cleared out as
much mud from inside the barge as they
could get at others were kept busy burning
holes through the green timber with the
white-hot irons corresponding holes were
sunk in the same way to some depth in the
barge timbers and the tough hackberry
beam securely pegged across the floor joist
of the barge bain now felt that he had
something to which he could safely hitch
his chain

  a crew was set afloat in the wagon-bed
and instructed to stir up as much mud from
the interior of the submerged part of the
barge as possible

  evry little bit heps was willie
thompsons comment on this phase of the
work mistuh bain hes gwine at dis
jes like he makes a cotton crop doin evry
thing a-fore hits needed an not stoppin
doin hit till hit taint no use boys wes
good as off dis crawfish house now

  channy you and robert and alex cut
us eight or ten round logs for rollers-make
em long enough bain called  bout
fourteen feet

  boss asked willie gently how is jes
us niggers gwine to pull dat ol boat out
all dat mud an water hit weighs

  if there had been any doubt of success in
willies mind he would not have asked the
question now he knew in his bones mis-
tuh bain had something up his sleeve-
sumpthin dat will work shore- conse-
quently he wished to anticipate victory

  we can pull her out all right i aint
afraid of that part of it willie thing is
will she stand it

  i sho wants to see how is you gwine to
manage

  bain cocked a wise noncommittal gray

eye at the scurrying clouds


adventure

  must be two oclock go get some
grub boys and hurry back

  after the men had eaten bain set some
of them digging the earth from in front of
the barge for five or six yards up the slope
the ground was smoothed and leveled
several of the rollers previously prepared
were placed in readiness on this space-one
well back under the sloping prow of the old
boat

  now willie the manager instructed
take your ax and chop a little hole in the
front end of the barge-right in the middle
-big enough for our chain to pass through
better use that sharp ax of uncle johns

  while this was being done bain sent
channy uncle john and several others to
cut a supply of prize-poles logs and rollers

twenty feet up the mound
from the barge grew two straight
young hackberries they were
over a foot in diameter and stood
nearly sixteen feet apart bain had a heavy
log hoisted and lashed to these trees form-
ing a horizontal bar from one to the other
eight feet from the ground this timber
was lashed in place with some of their
precious rope on the sides of the trees away
from the barge

  another thick log was laid from tree to
tree on the ground exactly under the first
near the center of this lowercross-piece a
hole was dug the hole was sunk close to
the side of the lower cross-piece on the side
farthest from the barge care was taken
to make the hole as nearly uniform in diam-
eter from top to bottom as possible and to
make it with straight sides post-hole fash-
ion completed it was about four feet
deep with a piece of cane bain measured
the distance from the bottom of the hole to
the top edge of the upper crosspiece

  we better make it two feet over-itll
grind down into the ground some all
right lay this on a good round sound
eight-inch log and cut me a piece just this
length

  none of the men yet had an inkling of
what the manager was about he pur-
posely kept his plans to himself knowing
that curiosity lent interest to the grueling
work then too he was inventing and ex-
perimenting as he went along as the neces-
sities demanded and he could act with a
show of confidence only by pretending to
have predetermined plans fully matured

  willie pass one end of our log chain
through that hole you just made and loop
it around the beam we pegged to the barge
bottom get it in the middle thats it

that ought to hold till-freezes over and

it wont pull one timber of the old scow
more than another

  where is we to put dis cap

  six men bore on hand sticks the log he
had ordered cut

  dont put it down slue your end over
the hole robert thats it now ander-
son you and albert raise up on your end
guide it channy thats it

  the stout round timber was neatly
stepped in the hole and stood upright
across the two horizontal cross-pieces

  now robert bain ordered the driver
coon up to the cross-piece

  a rope was handed him and the manager
instructed robert to pass a loose loop about
the upright post making fast to the middle
of the upper cross-timber

  by this time the chain had been securely
fastened to the stout timber attached to the
bottom frame-work of the barge the free
end which ran through the hole cut in the
forward bulkhead of the boat for the pur-
pose was dragged uphill to the contrivance
between the trees the chain was made
fast near the middle of the upright log with
several yards over this surplus was used
in attaching four strong levers each eight
feet in length at right angles to the up-
right

  mistuh bain done made a windlass ex-
claimed willie in gleeful triumph

  he sho is came a murmured chorus of
admiration

  hit aint no windlass hits a capstand
scornfully corrected channy who had been
a steam boat nigger

  well what de difference one works
up an one hit works crossways dey does
de same dont dey

  now boys listen with those four levers
and four or five men on each one walking
round we can drag that barge out but go
easy even a new boat cant stand rough
handling on land and this one aint new by

a - sight besides itll have tons of

water in it if we could snatch it right out
it would smash like an egg shell as she
comes inch her and give the water time to
spill back

  bain made a final inspection of all ar-
rangements
flood



   get your rollers ready willie line em
up all set up there hold till i say the
word easy now take up your slack
hold it now-all together-steady

   there was a dumb deadly struggle as the
men strained against the inertia of the big
load then the barge stirred it gave
hardly more than a wriggle in its muddy
bed but bain watching at the waters edge
knew that in the first round he and his crew
had won

  steady he called hold what you
have and get your wind a minute shes
coming

   inch by inch taking every precaution and
allowing the water to waste back from the
lower end as the hull was dragged upward
the barge was pulled up the slope after
the first great tug had freed the bottom of
the boat from its nest of mud power be-
came a secondary consideration now they
must go slowly for fear of damaging the
ancient planking of the sides and bottom

  but as dusk settled for the third time
upon the group marooned on indian mound
the last hatful of water-they had no bucket
with which to bale-was flung out of the
barge which now rested high and dry
bain declared it time to grub up and
sleep

  the manager himself mounted guard over
the barge and wagon-bed boat the camp
was quiet throughout the night

  dawn came in a lull of the bitter wind
which had swept down from the northeast
for forty-eight hours the sky was plas-
tered smoothly over with a uniform gray
cloudiness and an occasional small dry
snowflake brushed bains anxious face as he
tramped uphill to camp

   all right boys he called roll out

  tattered black forms dopey with sleep
slowly crawled into sitting postures about
the fire then scrambled to their feet

  the heavy works over announced the
manager we can divide our crew wil-
lie take channy and rob and get you some
good throwing sticks and clubs cut when
you get plenty take the wagon-bed and see
what you can find for grub try to get
enough for two days soon after a meager
breakfast of the interminable meat meat
meat with no salt to put on it the hands
were hard at work

  close inspection showed the barge to be
in anything but seaworthy condi tion there
were two holes in the bottom one fully

three feet square and the side most of
which had been under water was smashed
in several different places

  hits sho a wreck exclaimed uncle
john key anxiously boss is we gwine to
staht out in dat an it a-spittin snow
well cobble it up uncle john well
have quiet water here in the woods and
after we get to the open well be nearly
safe

  yessuh

  the old darkey was apparently reassured
bain set some of his men to splitting long
straight logs into rough clapboards while
others cleaned the barge the manager
stood over this group and superintended
their work closely

  dont put too much steam into that
scraping albert he cautioned critically
examining the floor of the flatboat she
wont stand much man-handling

nawsuh she sho aint overly stout
acquiesced the cheerful youth mistuh
bain how is we gwine to patch dem holes
well cobble em up albert is that
the boat coming back

  hit sho is dey got a load of rabbits an
possums too jes look

  the hunting expedition had certainly been
highly successful

  we jes raked em in cap explained
willie us found a drif bout big as a
island it wuz most covered wid critters
mostly rabbits an some possums

  well their hard luck is our vantage
mused bain viewing the trophies of the
chase they would have starved or frozen
anyway in a couple of days unload em
and put six or eight men to cleaning and
cooking

  when the wagon-bed was empty the
manager had it dragged from the water

  uncle john you and channy and willie
and anderson take that to pieces dont
lose a nail or a screw thats what we need
most dont wreck the floor its tongue-
and-groove just leave it whole well nail
it over those holes

  with a sharp ax the floor was cut in two
cross-wise the halves were split four
patches were thus secured these were
nailed over the yawning holes in the floor of
the barge bain had a false floor of green
clapboards laid amidship when the patching
was completed earth was spread upon
this

  well need fire he exclaimed we


adventure

wont be working so hard and our clothes
are pretty well worn out

  rollers were placed between the shore and
the barge and it was gently returned to the
water from which it had been hauled with
such labor twenty-four hours before the
chain was not detached from the windlass
but it was slackened as the boat was eased
downward with prize-holes launching
was easily accomplished

  well it floats was bains unimpas-
sioned comment

  they had done their work thoroughly
but little water came in by the patches
which had been lagged and calked with cer-
tain less essential garments donated or com-
mandeered the craft as it stood possessed
the two salient qualities of an egg-shell boat
great displacement-and consequent buoy-
ancy-and extreme fragility

  before placing firewood their axes and
provisions on board bain called the twenty-
two negroes to the camp-fire while warm-
ing his back and looking vaguely over the
tree tops he addressed them without rhet-
oric tilting backward and forward on his
heels and toes to keep from roasting

  boys that barge will hold us all and
would float twice as many again but shes
rotten as a last years punkin shell and if we
smash into a log or a tree or if we aint care-
ful every which-a-way therell be the-

to pay

  heres what i mean to do well get out
on dupree lake and follow it to where the
wragon road strikes in then well travel
east following the opening of the road till
we hit the dummy-line track we can turn
north then and follow that to the plantation
the dummy-line right-of-way will give us
clear going and pretty soon well get to
where the road bed is graded

  the water oughtnt to be very deep over
that there is a string of flats loaded with
logs standing on the dummy-line not far
from pecan bavou if anything goes wrong
and we have to swim better strike for there
if were too far to make the mound swim
from tree to tree if the cold dont get you
you can make it

  what ef we cant swim asked uncle
john key earnestly

  sink said bain laconically amid a
heartening shout of laughter and thus
ended the longest speech he had ever made
now get the stuff on board dont leave
any axes nor rope we may need em

  when the men trotted downhill to their
welcome task willie thompson unnoticed
tarried behind

  cap he said in a low voice to bain
watch dat big scar-faced nigger i heard
him talkin las night an now i knows
where i done seed him befo

  who is he

  you member dat hold-up nigger what
you caught five vear ago dis fall at de wood-
shed

bain did when the negro had
presented a gun at his head the
manager who had an armful of
oak stove wood had let drive
with the top billet of the load which he
happened to be still holding in his right
hand

  it was only necessary then to dump the
wood on his prostrate assailants head and
go in to telephone the doctor and deputy
sheriff a surgeon a jury and a prison
warden next had to do in the order named
with the daring stranger bain had not
thought of the incident before for three
years it came back now in a flash and his
own memory corroborated willies informa-
tion

  hum thats the birdall right wouldnt
be surprized if he wasnt responsible for
our being here willie i guess he set my
cord-wood

  cap i knows he did listen heah what
i heard him tellin dat worthless fair
thomas an oakley brown las night he
say he gwine to ketch yo widout your gun
fore we gits home an git even bout dat
other time he done busted out fom de
tucker state farm and lows he kilt a
guard he sho thinks yous got a gun
mistuh bain

  does he

  bain might have been discussing a cup of
coffee

  yessuh he sot de wood on fiah to
bring you out but we wuz all dere an he
wuz feared to shoot you watch him
mistuh bain an i sho will he wont talk
none to our niggers but he is busy plannin
mischief wid dem no count day-hands what
stahted to skip wid him

  much oblige willie ill watch

  they descended to the barge the pro-
vision of charred half-cooked meat-they
were learning what it is to loathe food and
to starve simultaneously-was stored on
flood



board a supply of dry firewood the axes
rope chain and fragments of the wagon-
bed were likewise put on the barge a
quantity of long straight poles and rude
paddles hewed from split green boards were
placed on top of the other equipment ready
to hand bain saw to everything

  those gunwales ought to be strength-
ened and stiffened but we aint got the
nails he mused theyre rotten as
punk

   the negroes glad of any release from that
mound of tribulation were piling into the
quaking high-riding hull

  not so fast there barked bain some
of youll put a foot through the bottom
take your time and be careful

  he saw the last man-channy-safe
aboard after a searching look to see that
all of their slender store of equipment was
loaded the manager carefully straddled the
forward gunwale and stepped aboard

  shove off channy

   they were afloat at last

  from the mound they abandoned to the
nearest land which stood above water it
was seven and a half miles following the
i only route which would be possible for their
craft their voyage could not be less than
twice this distance using the care abso-
lutely necessary to safety and propelled by
their crude paddles they could not hope to
reach the plantation before afternoon of the
following day if all went well

   all did not go well

  they traversed dupree lake tied up for
the night and were not far from the dummy
line the morning of the second day of the
voyage when disaster came upon them with
one stroke of an ax

  for days now and greatly augmented
since the party had embarked the strain on
bains nerves had been intense knowing
the weaknesses of their craft as none of them
did he watched every movement of every
man saw that floating logs were avoided
and limbs and tree trunks passed at a safe
distance

   he assigned positions in the barge to each
man the older and more careful negroes
were placed where the planking of the gun-
wale and bottom was rottenest bain him-
self stood amidship on the starboard side
the gunwale at this point was little better
than punk and he knew that the least lick
on it there would precipitate disaster

  it was near noon on the second day of

their voyage when their fragile ark glided
out into the open waters of pecan bayou

  mistuh bain hits a-runnin yelled
channy excitedly

  instinctively the eight men who were
paddling-four to the side-held their
stroke the high-riding light shell imme-
diately felt the impulse of the live water

  paddle on your side willie bain
warned sharply back water anderson-
all on this side back hard

  before the dangerous momentum given
by the unexpected current could be counter-
acted by the paddles the barge spun half
around and darted like a sentient thing for
the bushy top of a submerged water elm
the springy limbs ensnared the drifting
boat in half a second it lay at rest in the
tree top no holes were punched in the hull
so far as they could see

  dont move called bain to the fright-
ened negroes if you start rushing around
were sunk

  he crept forward carefully through the
limbs knife in hand lopping off the smaller
branches as he moved

  we is ridin on a even keel anyhow
said channy thankfully

  bain completed his rapid survey

  we can get off all right but well have
to work like walking on eggs these limbs
are stiff enough to hold us but they aint
any good to stand on

  want us to be cuttin dese limbs cap
asked the scarfaced negro respectfully

  go to it answered bain

  if he hesitated to place an ax in the mans
hands the fact that he had no gun would
be apparent the manager himself handed
the desperado an ax treating him precisely
as he did the others

  careful he cautioned if you stave

in the side-s to pay

  boss suddenly asked robert is dis
up-stream or down-stream from dem flat
cars loaded wid logs

  up-stream-about two hundred yards
dats luck sho aint it mistuh bain
yeah if we get loose we can shove out
into this current and go right down if we
have to swim itll be easy to make if we
dont freeze	

  if we gits to there we is all right vol-
unteered willie thompson cheerfully de
water over de railroad bed wont be overly
deep us kin wade out if we gits to dem
flat cars


adventure

  yes bain acquiesced slowly the
water over the dummy line oughtnt to be
over two or three feet deep in most places

  cap asked scar-face ef we gits on
dat track how far is we to sho nuft dry
land

  couple of miles

  for a quarter of an hour they worked
carefully to dislodge the barge finally all
obstructions were cleared but one limb
which held them amidship just under
the rotten section of the starboard gun-
wale which bain had guarded with such
care

  now boys listen the manager warned
weve got to get off here but we may
smash this side in doing it if we do well
sink in four minutes if we have to swim
strike a line this way- he pointed south-
east- for those flat cars swim from tree
to tree the water here in the bayou chan-
nel is about forty feet deep now but if you
get to the log cars you can climb out on
them and get your wind then wade this
way northwest on the road bed bain
leaned overboard to inspect the detaining
limb

  look out

  it was willies voice high-pitched with
urgency and fear the manager turned as
a gleaming ax blade smashed the rotten
planking where his neck had rested bain
had just time to identify his assailant before
the big boat listing swiftly to the inrush of
water from the wrecked side and borne down
by its cargo of scrambling shrieking ne-
groes slid to the sand-scored bottom of
pecan bayou

the tingling shock of icy water
cut to bains very heart for the
first time in five days and nights
he thought of his own fate as a
thing distinct from the group of dependent
beings under his charge he shot to the
surface with vigorous strokes already the
men were swimming into the trees below

  the timber was so thick that a few strokes
would carry a man from one objective to an-
other with the strong current aiding this
was acomplished with practically no effort
only the gripping marrow-searching cold of
the water could prevent their reaching the
flat cars below

  the manager was no expert swimmer
but a level head is half the battle when one
is dumped suddenly into deep waters he

calmly turned on his left side and struck
out for a large oak fifty yards down-stream
following the course taken by his crew

  oh mistuh bain dont leave 
uncle jawn mistuh bain-please suh dont
leave me heah to die mistuh bain oh
mistuh bain

  he had reached the oak catching a
lower limb the manager in defiance of the
cold was resting the old darkeys voice
came faint from the elm top near which the
barge had gone down bain weighed his
chances deliberately he could swim to
safety with the start he had if he returned
and attempted the journey again with a
panic-crazed old negro in tow the outcome
would be at best doubtful

  mistuh bain dont leave me heah to
die hits  jawn oh mistuh bain

  the white man suddenly stopped reason-
ing and turned to breast the icy current on
the back trail as he turned a heavy stick
of sodden drift-wood drove into the water
in the exact spot his head had been a half
second before in the same instant he saw
the huge convict lose his balance and fall
plunging head foremost from a limb upon
which he had perched to do his murder

  bain did not miss a stroke glancing
back he saw that the negros foot seemed to
be caught in a fork while he made frantic
efforts to draw himself back on the limb

  ive been lucky twice this day bain
said half aloud

  it was as nearly a prayer as he had ut-
tered in twenty-five years

  oh mistuh bain

  there was more of patient trust than of
fear in the old mans weakening voice the
manager noted it as he fought his way back
and it warmed him to the desperate
work

  he found the old negro clinging like a
huge black locust to the rough bark of a
limbless red-gum

  i knowed youd come ef you heahed me
mistuh bain i cant swim none what is
us gwine to do

  bains answer was dramatic a cotton-
wood rail was shooting down the channel
he plunged after it and returned pushing
the buoyant stick of timber

  now just keep your head uncle john
and youll eat corn bread and mustard
greens by your own fireplace tonight you
aint forgot how aunt sally fixes em with
hog jowl and red pepper
vanished castles



  exhibiting confidence which he lacked
and square miles of feeling bain gradually
detached uncle john from his tree

  dont try to ride the rail uncle john
sink deep and just let it bear your head up
thats it you cant sink just float along
with it

  the current shot them under the oak
bain had lately quitted depending from
a lower limb hung the body of a man the
left ankle was fast in a fork of the springy
wood only the head hung in water the
giant negro had been drowned like a strug-
gling kitten his head forced gradually
lower and lower by sheer exhaustion his
last attempt on bains life had destroyed
him

  that night one white man and twenty-
one negroes drank clean water ate food
other than meat and slept under a roof for
the first time in nearly a week

  not only did all the men-with the one
gruesome exception-reach home in safety

but the teams were found safe and sound
all but  tony and  joe roberts be-
loved jug-heads

  itll cost me seven hundred dollars to
replace them thought bain opening ac-
cumulated mail next morning we can
salvage the wagons but roberts teams
gone

  he jerked open an uninteresting second-
class envelope perfunctorily a cheaply
printed dodger fell out

  iooo reward it was headed below
was an unmistakable likeness of scar-face
he had murdered a guard and a trusty at
tucker state farm in making his escape
three months before in bold letters the
reward was again specified in the bottom
line with the significant addition

  dead or alive

  either way hell pay for  tony and
 joe said bain but i like him a lot
better the way he is oh willie get the
skiff ready

fcsy-jobs a general rule oppression in the
r a wl middle ages was strictly a one-way
affair the lords oppressed the

  k  people and that was all there was
about it but there were exceptions to this
general rule for example the feudal law
seemed to run rather sluggishly in the neigh-
borhood of liege in the fifteenth century
at the time when feudalism was at the apo-
gee preceding its decline this manufacturing
city under its ruling bishop had an ex-
tremely short way of dealing with intrusive
nobles the city is surrounded by heights
which commanding it offered most eligible
sites for feudal castles since one of the feu-
dal jests with the commonalty was the stop-
ping of provisions until a ransom should be
paid

  but according to michelet

  some morning the mountain would hear
no sounds from the city and would see
neither fire nor smoke the people had
struck work presently from twenty to
thirty thousand workmen would defile
through the gates march on such or such

a castle dismantle and lay it level with the
ground they would indemnify the baron
with lands in the plain- where to inter-
polate a remark he could not watch them-
and a good house in liege- where they
could keep an eye upon him

  the archives of the city quoted by the
same historian relates that one of the bar-
ons in question sir radus returned from a
journey he had taken in company with the
bishop of liege to find the spot on which
his castle had stood entirely bare

  by my fay sir bishop his astonished
voice comes to us down the ages i know
not whether i am dreaming or awake but
i was accustomed to see my house syl-
vestre here and now i do not perceive it
be not angry my good radus replied
the bishop gently you shall not be a
loser by it

  one imagines the gentle churchman look-
ing slightly embarrassed

  but he adds diffidently i have had
a monastery built out of the stones of your
castle

ee that island over there away
on the port bow

  i looked in the direction to-
ward which the skipper of the
golden treasure was pointing and with
some difficulty was able to make out a faint
blur rather like a smudge of dark cloud
against the horizon

  i can see something i answered a little
doubtfully

  well thats atimara its marked on
the chart but if you didnt know you might
easily mistake it for a fly-blow i once
knew a skipper not well acquainted with
these latitudes who made that mistake and
piled up his ship there in a fog anyway
thats atimara old david mcclures is-
land

  and who i inquired innocently is old
david mcclure

  never heard of david mcclure oh
well perhaps you wouldnt being a stranger
in these parts but hes a rum old bird is
mcclure one hits on some queer speci-
mens in these parts but hes about the
queerest of them all yes i think i may
say that and his teeth- mean to say
youve never heard about his teeth

  no but i should like to

  why those teeth of his theyre known
from one end of the pacific to the other
famous they are but ill tell you about
them if you like and its a rum story

the teeth of mcclure copyright  by rolf bennett 

  the skipper settled himself more com-
fortably in his deckchair then filled and
lighted his pipe when it was drawing to
his satisfaction he started and this is the
story of the teeth of mcclure

  about thirty-five years ago he began
david mcclure came to atimara which
as ive told you is no more than a flea-bite
of an island as islands go where he came
from and why he went there i dont know
and anyway it doesnt much matter but
he started right away to annex that island
and he did it nobody interfered with him
for nobody knew whether the island be-
longed to the french the british or the
germans and whats more nobody cared
so mcclure he built himself a store and
imported a lot of trade-goods which he bar-
tered with the natives for copra and a
mighty good thing he made of it did
mcclure before he came the natives
must have wasted tons of cokernuts through
carelessness ignorance and the like and
also through not having a regular market
well mcclure changed all that and before
long atimara was shipping more copra than
many islands double its size

  for a time maybe a year or more mc-
clure was content with that hed got a
monopoly of the trade and he was respected
by the natives he didnt try to govern
them or make any laws though some of
their customs werent what youd call
the teeth of mcclure



refined not by long odds in those days it
wasnt unusual for different villages to de-
clare war on one another have a fight and
end up with a cannibal feast mcclure
didnt like that because during these
fights-and when they were drunk with
kava-they did a lot of damage to the coker-
nut palms and that meant so much less
copra still he didnt like to interfere
with them not knowing what might hap-
pen if he did and i wont say he wasnt
wise if they wanted to eat one another
it wasnt any concern of his but he cer-
tainly did get rattled at the loss of so many
good palms but as i say he couldnt do
anything-not then

  and now im coming to the strange part
of it mcclure had a complete set of false
teeth ive heard say that hed picked
them up second-hand in san francisco but
i dont believe it myself but whether
he bought them first or second hand he was
mighty proud of those teeth was mcclure
and sometimes when palavering with the
natives hed astonish them by clapping
ihis hand to his mouth and taking out his
teeth they couldnt understand it at all
and at first some of them were a bit fright-
tened never having seen such a thing
before

  well the fame of those teeth spread
and natives even came from other islands
just to see mcclure take them out of his
head and put them back again it helped
his business quite a lot for outside natives
would come and trade with him just for the
sake of seeing him take out his teeth it
never struck mcclure at the time that the
inhabitants of atimara had made up their
minds that these teeth of his must be a sort
of demon or god which could act so to
speak independent of him he thought
they looked at it as a sort of novel conjuring
trick and him as a mighty clever fellow for
being able to do it

  now it was mcclures habit to take his
teeth out every night before going to bed
and put them on the veranda rail to air as
you may say and it used to puzzle him
why when he went to fetch them in the
morning there should be half a dozen or so
empty cokernut bowls lying under the
veranda he couldnt make it out at all
mcclure couldnt until one day his atten-
tion was attracted by jake this jake
was a young goat of that name which had
been given him by the skipper of a trading

schooner and mcclure had grown most
astonishingly fond of it i dont think i
ever saw another animal with such a baleful
and wicked look in its eyes as that goat had
and apart from hating everything and
everybody he this goat was all horns and
appetite

  however theres no accounting for
tastes and mcclure certainly did love this
wretched goat notwithstanding it tried to
butt him every time he came within range of
its moorings now one morning as i say
when he went out as usual to fetch his teeth
and wish the time of day to jake mcclure
noticed something funny about the goat
at first he thought it was ill and wondered
if any of the natives who all hated jake

like the- had been trying to poison him

but the more he looked the more sure he
was it couldnt be that and at last he
got the right answer jake was drunk
yes sir if ever a goat was soused that goat
was jake

  how did he get drunk mcclure tried
to figure it out-and youll allow it was a
pretty tough conundrum-and while he
was doing it he happened to notice the
usual empty cokernut shells lying on the
ground below the veranda well he
started putting two and two together did
mcclure and presently the answer came to
him in a flash the natives he reckoned
must be in the habit of coming to the store
at night and placing offering of food and
kava-thats the native tipple you know-
down opposite where the teeth were airing
and jake his chain being just long enough
to reach the spot had lapped up the lot
food and kava as well but to make abso-
lutely sure mcclure had the chain short-
ened so that jake couldnt reach the spot
wthere the offerings were placed and the
next morning he found them there little
cokernut bowls filled with food and kava

  as for jake there wasnt a madder goat
in al the pacific i suppose hed got to
like his little drop of drink but anyway he
tried all he knew to butt mcclure and
when he couldnt do that he tried to butt
the store down so always after this mc-
clure left him a little bowl of kava over-
night-which shows you what a fool hed
grown to be over that goat

  anyway thats how he came to learn
what the natives thought of the teeth but
whether they reckoned the teeth them-
selves were a spirit or were just used by a


adventure

spirit he didnt know its difficult for a
white man to see inside a natives mind or
even to guess his thoughts and in that re-
spect mcclure wasnt any wiser than the
rest of us

  but as owner or guardian or high priest
of the teeth-and he didnt know which he
was supposed to be-mcclure saw that he
could do things he wouldnt have dared
otherwise so he started right there to
make laws and regulations and other im-
provements he even put a stop to can-
nibalism and fighting likewise he built a
wooden jetty and had roads made between
the different villages what he said went
and after a time the natives brought their
quarrels for him to decide instead of settling
them with a knife or a spear as before and
his verdict was accepted without question
for he judged fair did mcclure as fair as
any man could

        that went on for years now
ggjsjsd and again a new trader hearing
what a lot of copra was shipped
from atimara and the big profits
mcclure was making would come and fix
up a store in the hope of getting some of
the business but the natives refused to
have anything to do with strangers and
it always ended by the newcomer clearing
out after selling his trade-stock to mcclure
for anything that mcclure liked to give
well so it went on and it looked as if
mcclure was as unshiftable as the rock
of gibraltar but you never know whats
going to happen in this world do you

  one day a new trader arrived at ati-
mara his name was joe price and hed
come from port moresby in papua-any-
way he said he had well he built himself
a store just like all the others had done and
started business by offering the natives
better terms for their copra than mcclure
had ever given this didnt worry mc-
clure any for most of the others had done
the same thinking they could smash him
that way and always it was themselves that
got smashed all mcclure had to do was
to sit tight and say nothing and presently
hed buy the other chaps stock and wave
him good-by from the jetty

  well it looked as if the same thing was
going to happen sure enough this time
none of the natives would go near the new
mans store and though he gave presents to
the village headmen and they took them

it didnt bring him a cents worth of trade
and mcclure was l already beginning to
figure out what hed give price for his stock
when a very remarkable thing happened

  the teeth disappeared

  they disappeared one night when
mcclure went in the morning to take them
off the rail of the veranda they werent
there mcclure he could hardly believe
his eyes and it was some little while before
he was convinced that they really had gone
now youll understand what a mighty bad
shock this gave mcclure all his power and
influence over the natives rested on those
teeth of his

  he didnt know what to make of it at
first but it wasnt so very long before he
reckoned he had the answer to the riddle
he felt as certain as could be that none of
the natives would have dared lay a finger
on the teeth they were much too scared of
them for that so who could have stolen
them but price the fellow who was still
trying to knock him out

  price of course had heard all about the
teeth and he knew that it was because of
them mcclure had a monopoly of the trade
and ruled over atimara like a little tin king
he likewise knew price did that the teeth
were put on the veranda rail outside mc-
clures store every night to receive the offer-
ings of the natives so you see it would
be a pretty easy job for him to creep up to
the veranda at night and pocket the
teeth

  it was a wonder none of the other
traders whod tried to do business in ati-
mara hadnt thought of the same thing
seeing how easy and simple it was now
that it was too late mcclure wanted to
kick himself for being such a fool as to leave
his teeth where price or any one else who
might have a grudge against him could
just walk up and take them away

  well they say troubles never come
singly and it happened that way to mc-
clure before hed got over the shock of
losing his teeth or had had time to think
how he might get them back he saw some
of the village headmen coming up the road
to the store it didnt strike mcclure as
anything unusual till he saw that each of
them carried something in his hand-a
gourd for instance a dead chicken a lava-
lava as the native dress is called and so on
they walked up to the front of the store and
sat down facing it as they always did for a
the teeth of mcclure



palaver and mcclure stood on the veranda
waiting to hear what theyd got to say

  so after the kava bowl had been passed
round the oldest headman got up and
spoke during the night he said a lot of
damage had been done to native property
fences had been knocked down garden
crops damaged a chicken killed and even
some of the family washing left out to dry
had been destroyed and to prove it each
man held up what hed brought with him-
the damaged gourd the dead chicken the
torn lava-lava and what not

  it was then that mcclure had what he
took to be an inspiration and sorry enough
he was for himself afterward it seemed
to him that nothing better could have hap-
pened it seemed sort of providential to
him that all this damage should have been
done just then and he thought he saw his
way to take advantage of it so what must
he do but pitch those headmen a fine yarn
about how the other white man had stolen
the sacred teeth in the night and how the
tooth spirit was angry at this outrage and

had played the-with their property to

ilet them know it

  the only way to appease the tooth
spirit he said was for them to insist on
price putting the teeth back in the place
where the spirit was accustomed to look for
them if they didnt do that and the teeth
didnt come back he said the gardens and
such-like would be destroyed from one end
of atimara to the other and no two ways
about it

  when mcclure had finished talking the
oldest headman stood up again and started
to speak he said it wasnt any tooth
spirit which had destroyed their garden
stuff and so on but the taubadas goat
jake hed worked free from his moorings
in the night jake had and had gone on the
spree lots of the natives had seen him
and some had tried to catch him but though
hed got several fathoms of chain adrift of
him astern jake had been too slippy for
them

  well mcclure sent for his servant-a
chink that did his cooking and the house-
work-and the chink said it was quite right
what the headmen said jake had got
loose in the night and escaped hfrd come
back early in the morning and man fong-
that was the chink-had caught him and
fastened him to his moorings again

  now mcclure knew enough about the

native mind to be aware that it hasnt got
room for more than one idea at a time
those chaps had seen jake raising cain in
their garden patches and it was no use try-
ing to tell them it was the tooth spirit
they knew better and the fact that hed
tried to make out it was the tooth spirit
hadnt done him any good either he
could see that it was a great pity he
hadnt waited till hed heard all they had to
say before trying to put that yarn across
all he could do now was to promise com-
pensation for the damage jake had done
and let it go at that he knew hed made a
mess of things did mcclure

  of course it wasnt very long before
every one in atimara knew that mcclure
had lost his teeth now youll generally
find that a native though he may be
plunged fathoms deep in superstition has a
logic thats as simple and unanswerable as a
childs and the way those chaps looked
at it was this if mcclure hadnt got the
teeth then he couldnt make the tooth
spirit-or whatever they reckoned it to be-
he couldnt make it punish them if they
went to price and got better terms for their
copra

  there was no two ways about that
was there and they did in a few days
mcclures store was as deserted as prices
had been not a native came near it nor
brought so much as an ounce of copra
nativelike they forgot all the good hed
done like making roads planting coker-
nuts making decent laws and so on all
they cared was that they could trade with
price on better terms than with mc-
clure

  mind you mcclure could have afforded
to offer them terms that would have put
joe price out of business in a week but
having been topside joss in atimara for so
many years he wasnt going to put himself
on the other mans level so to speak but
what hurt the old man most i fancy was
the fact that the natives didnt come to him
to settle their disputes like they used
mcclure had in a manner of speaking come
to look on them almost as his children and
it was a terrible hard blow when they de-
serted him and went instead to a stranger a
man who hadnt been on the island three
months and there was another thing as
well having lost his teeth mcclure
couldnt eat anything but slops which hed
never been used to and didnt like


adventure

he grew to be a changed
man he became thin and hol-
low-cheeked and dyspeptic a
mere shadow of the man he had
been before his teeth went his only con-
solation was jake why he loved that ugly
savage brute of a goat i never could guess
but there it was hed sit for hours talking
to it just as if it was a human being and
jake hed stand there working his jaws and
waiting for mcclure to come within range
of his chain to butt him good and hard

  now price naturally hadnt any cause
to love david mcclure and i dont pretend
he had but mcclure was beaten his
store was deserted he couldnt eat any
proper food and his pride had been humbled
-and that ought to have satisfied price
but it didnt hed got his knife into mc-
clure so to speak and he meant to give it
one or two good twists while he could

  he soon got to know about the goat and
how mcclure was sort of comforted by
talking to it so what does price do but
bribe one of the natives to go and kill jake
during the night and for all that mc-
clure had tried to freeze him out of ati-
mara it was a pretty low-down trick

  anyway the goat was murdered next
morning when mcclure stepped out on to
his veranda the first thing he saw was the
dead body of jake with a spear in its side
from what ive heard tell mcclure just
broke down and cried like a child-and i
shouldnt wonder if it was true seeing he
was in such a low state anyhow mc-
clure swore the goat should have a proper
christian burial so he dug a grave mcclure
did and buried jake in it and said the
prayer for them in peril on the sea which
was the only one he could remember

  now if price hadnt done that mean
trick on mcclure hed probably be in
atimara now and boss of the island but
in getting jake killed he overreached him-
self it happened this way when the

natives heard that the goat had been
killed what must some of them do but go
the next night and dig him up sos they
could roast him and have a feast

  they lit a fire on the beach-right in
front of mcclures store-and started in to
skin and prepare the mortal remains of
jake this was at night remember so
mcclure was asleep but presently he
was wakened up by a most almighty row
and at first he thought the natives were
attacking his place

  he listened for a while to their yells
and hoots then grabbed a revolver and
went out to see what was happening all
he could make out at first was a big fire on
the beach about fifty yards away with a
bunch of niggers round it however he
thought hed better discover what all the
racket was about so down he goes to the
beach there he saw a score or so of
young natives some of them doing a sort of
war dance and others lying on their bellies
beating the ground with their hands he
thought at first mcclure did that they
were holding a cannibal feast and had
chosen this spot to show they didnt care
any longer for him and his laws

  he tightened his finger round the trigger
of his revolver thinking to himself hed
reach these niggers they couldnt break the
laws hed given them even if he had lost
his teeth and he crept nearer did mc-
clure nearer and nearer

  and then he suddenly had a shock for
of course it wasnt a human carcass like
hed expected but the remains of jake
skinned and trussed ready for roasting and
that wasnt all either for near the car-
cass just as theyd been fetched out of the
goats belly were-the teeth of mcclure

  and that concluded the skipper of the
golden treasure is why joe price left ati-
mara by the first boat that called and
david mcclure again became topside joss
a cjueerish sort of story dont you think
kings meal

author of wild gas plucks broken parole etc

 far as he could see and as far
as he could see-and that was
very far indeed-all the world
was one glistening white wonder
mountain hill valley stream tufted wood
and frowning hanger thicket and dense
brake-all white and still and silent under
the thin sun

  he took a turn aloft about a thousand feet
up and executed an effortless circle then
he let himself down three hundred feet and
described a figure eight grandly then he
sank another three hundred feet and curved
marvelously but it was no use-white
white white everywhere he looked and not a
living thing upon it-the snow

  he was an eagle of the golden persuasion
which means that he was gaited in a uni-
form of fine gunmetal-brown copper and
golden bronze also he was hungry in-
deed he was more than usually hungry
even and was a hot-bed of trouble in con-
sequence

  now there may be a few things in this
world that an eagle high aloft can not see
but mostly and at ordinary times the
thing big enough to be eaten that an eagle
can not see a few miles off may live but i
dont know it

  this however was no ordinary time and
those few things were there-there under
his cruel great hooked beak in the open

on view to all the world and-for the life
of him he could not see them

  motionless as one of the boulders around
him the cock ptarmigan crouched and
stared up at the great dread king of the birds
slowly swimming the sunlit void above him
and he croaked all around him dotted
about were the other ptarmigan of the
flock squatting as motionless as he in
the snow looking up and they said no
word

  fifty yards down the hill a mountain
hare couched in his form of warm snow
stared at the menacing embodiment of death
overhead and she never moved never made
the slightest attempt to escape

  a hundred yards farther down the slope
inert as an icicle smack upon the peculiar
line of footprints which the hare had left
when ascending the slope some half-hour
before bunched a stoat long snakey and
deadly glaring upward at the greater terror
above him

  all around the stoat yet invisible to him
were flattened little birds little snow bunt-
ings-snowflakes is their pet name-and
they too were all watching the mighty eagle
shape motionless frozen in terror-as if
he would have troubled about them

  but he did not see any of them though
quite out in the open ptarmigan hare
stoat and snow buntings were as invisible


adventure

to him as spirits because why because
they were all dressed in white pure white-
except for a few parts of the snowflakes and
the tip of the stoats or ermines if you like
tail from head to heel in white

  slowly the eagle passed on soaring su-
perbly sullen and savage ravenous and
desperate he seemed almost as if he had a
feeling that prey was beneath him though
he could not see it and once swung back
again to make sure

  then when he was but a black speck in
the sky no more than a mote dancing on the
eyeball the ravenous bloodthirsty nature
of the stoat got the upper hand of his cun-
ning and he broke the spell

  some chance eddy of the icey mountain
breeze had carried to him the scent of the
snow buntings flattened amongst the snow
all round him and creeping cautiously he
began to follow up the scent of one of them
he could not see the others because they
were still but they could see him and in-
stantly with a gentle prattle of alarm they
were up and away taking the stalked bird
with them-just so many little dancing
flakes of snow whirling down the wind

  the stoat stood for a moment with head
up watching them go then turned to the
business he had first had in hand when the
eagle stopped him the trailing of the white
mountain hare but that hare was no big-
ger fool than she looked not so big in
fact she had made her form in such a
position that anything tracking her along
her trail must approach down-wind must
that is give itself away hopelessly there-
fore she smelt the deadly ermine coming
and-pjf-was gone like some ghostly
shadow racing over the spotless white
slopes like the wind

  the stoat stopped dead and expressed his
feelings in an angry chatter of sheer temper
as he watched that hare literally dropping
down the giddy slopes to the far valley be-
neath he might of course continue to
track her with that amazing doggedness of
which the stoat is master but goodness
knows whether she would stop within a mile
or two and even half that distance is a lot
to a beast cursed or blessed with such
short legs as friend ermine especially over
snow

  then fate who loves to play idle tricks
and give things a wobble and see what will
happen shifted the wind eddies a little and

-that ermine had frozen to the likeness
of a marble carving of rare purity he was
smelling ptarmigan and it smelt good the
hare could go hang himself in a crofters
snare for all he cared now ptarmigan was
as good for dinner as hare or better

  flat as a white snake he crept over the
sparkling snow himself invisible upon it
save for the moving black tip of his tail-
yard by yard foot by foot inch by stealthy
hungry inch he drew on the scent trail in
another six strides he must have simply
sprung by scent alone upon the motionless
bird that he could not see

  and then before he could move under his
very nose it seemed as if a subterranean
mine had burst there in that place beneath
the snow there was a spurt a spout an
upheaval a cloud of snow a loud wild
whirring and flapping a very chaos of white
and in a breath almost the astonished stoat
was standing there alone and in silence the
immemorial silence of the mountains brok-
en only by the beat of wings dwindling
down-hill into the distance

  he had as a matter of fact put up-
burst up would more correctly describe it-
nine ptarmigan crouched in their tunnels
on and under the snow he did not know
it of course but they or some of them had
heard his chatter when he reviled the van-
ishing hare and had therefore been warned
of his malignant presence in time it was a
small matter but it shows how bad and
worse it is to lose ones temper in the
wild

  it is however ten times worse to forget
an enemy in the wild the stoat had for-
gotten one and again it was his temper that
made him do it

  there was a sound in the air above him
suddenly and unexpectedly as if a gigantic
sword had been whirled very quickly and
there shot athwart him a vast shadow that
put out the sun

  the stoat had no time to jump no time to
do anything he had only time to scream
his death cry before he had passed in a
single grip of mighty talons beyond the
worries of this world forever

  the eagle with prismatic binocular eyes
had seen him move in the first place when he
put up the snowflakes from very far off
and stealing back a very speck in the sky
had swooped upon him in that instant
and-slain

 r twenty years alex cheney and
i ih lisbeth had been well nigh insep-
n	arable she was the one thing of

	his which he ever bragged about

the only being upon whom he openly and
unblushingly lavished affection and those
who claim a mule is incapable of gratitude
never knew lisbeth

  lisbeth came into alexs possession in the
spring of  back at the great frontier
outfitting base at independence being
but one of a lot of forty-odd missouri mules
purchased by alex at that time and being
of a somewhat neutral dingy gray color
lisbeth did not attract any especial atten-
tion at that time from her new master in
the hurry and bustle of organizing his first
wagon-train and getting it started to cali-
fornia alex had no time to waste upon any
particular mule he did not even know her
age nor did he ever know exactly how old
she was it was true that when he bought
the lot the drover made some passing re-
mark about her but it was not until later
that he remembered it

  many of the hundred and fifty mules be-
longing to cheneys outfit were unbroken
and he had started with a goodly number of
extra ones the wild ones were worked
half a day at a time and then turned loose in
the extra band to recuperate lisbeth had
had two such ordeals when cheneys big

  lisbeth copyright  by david thibanlt	

saddle horse broke its leg in a prairie-dog
hole and had to be shot and since saddle
animals were at a premium cheney cast his
eye over the mules and it lighted upon two
small saddle marks upon lisbeths side he
recalled then that the drover had stated-

  that thar gray mule has been broke t
ride

  from that day forward lisbeth never
wore a collar

  lisbeth had a smooth running walk that
was as easy on her rider as floating down-
stream in a canoe she could take a sort of
jackrabbit lope at a mile-devouring clip and
keep it up for hours without tiring her rider
and when occasion demanded she could run
like an antelope nor did she ever require
whip or spur

  and so for twenty years she had shared
cheneys freighting destinies there were
few parts of the west to which they had not
penetrated at some time or other and cheney
himself could scarcely estimate how many
thousands of miles they had piloted the way
ahead of the lumbering freight wagons

  adventures they had had them by the
hundreds there had been the time when
alex and a friend had been chased for two
days and nights by a sioux war party and
for ten hours after the friends horse had
given out lisbeth had carried both men-to
safety
o

adventure

  there had been the time when with a
whole wagon-train snow-bound lisbeth had
broken trail twenty miles over a mountain
divide to get help when every other horse
and mule lay down in discouragement and
then there had been that supreme test of
intelligence and endurance in disaster gulch
where of over five hundred head of horses
mules-and oxen lisbeth was the only ani-
mal to survive and she carried her master
to virginia city in the spring

  winter had caught two wagon-trains in a
narrow gulch not far from the banks of the
missouri cheneys was one of them this
time there was no escape as the grass was
covered under four feet of snow the animals
took to browsing until every branch under
the size of a mans arm was eaten off day
by day the animals died and their carcasses
remained frozen in the snow in squalid
misery the freighters saw their sole means of
support perish

  lisbethll pull through alex cheney
predicted and she did-by learning to eat
meat cheney would roast a whole quarter
of an ox for her and under his tutelage she
learned to eat it

  it was things such as these which made
alex always turn a deaf ear to all proposals
to purchase his pet indeed it would not
do for a man to become too persistent
there was a man in lewiston once-but
that had happened ten years before now
lisbeth was no longer a dingy gray she
was snow-white and her muscles were no
longer as supple as they had been cheney
still rode her occasionally though he
kept a saddle horse to share the burden
no one any more ever thought of buying
her

  in the summer of  newt halvorsen
discovered gold on timber creek in an al-
most inaccessible part of the salmon river
mountains a stampede promptly resulted
and by the first of october there were a
thousand people in timber city cheneys
headquarters were in salt lake at the time
and it was the first of october before he
could arrange to start for the new camp if
he could get in that fall with a lot of goods
he knew there would be a killing to be
made far surpassing what most of the gold
hunters could hope for he had no doubt
of his ability to get in but getting out
might prove a difficult proposition how-
ever he had never been one to hesitate in
the face of difficulties and so including in

his wagon-train several loads of oats he
started

it had been on his mind to
leave lisbeth behind but he
knew that she would disapprove
and somehow a long trip without
her nosing about the mess wagon would not
seem natural

  snow had fallen in the higher mountains
when they reached timber city it was
almost december and the hint of approach-
ing winter was unmistakable to attempt
to get back out with his outfit cheney knew
would be folly he sold his merchandise at
a good price and then began to look around
timber city itself was not high low
down on the creek bottom were swamps
with dry grass four feet high in great abun-
dance he knew that his stock could winter
there without the least trouble in the
spring there would be ore to freight out and
in the meantime there was a chance to put
in a profitable winter at prospecting

  he sent all his stock with the exception
of lisbeth to the creek bottom lisbeths
days of enduring hardships when they could
be avoided by her master were over he
had plenty of oats left to last her through
the winter some enterprising miner had
cut a ton of dry hay with a scythe and piled
it up by hand alex paid a hundred and
fifty dollars gold for it any further pro-
vender that lisbeth might need he knew
that he could get from the boarding-house
he built a small stable of poles chinked
with moss and lisbeth was snugly en-
sconced for the winter alex had had to
endure a great deal of joking on account of
his mule but he took it with a good-natured
grin

  but back in salt lake cheneys business
was going to smash

  the news came in with the last mail and
the man who brought it declared his intention
of remaining in timber city for the winter

  i aint sayin a man cant make it out
through the mountains cause he can unless
it snows some more but theres ninety-nine
chances out of a hundred that its snowin
on the high divides right now he said

  cheney perused the letter from home
again it was from his wife all the sav-
ings he had in the world except what he had
made on this last trip were tied up in a mer-
cantile establishment in salt lake the
word sent by his wife was that his partner a
lisbeth



man he had known and trusted for years
had gone bad the fellow had become in-
volved in gambling debts and had bor-
rowed all the money he could on the re-
sources of the firm and left the country
mrs cheney was doing her best to keep
the business going but unless five thousand
dollars were forthcoming by the first of jan-
uary everything would be lost

  swiftly the freighter took stock of his
resources he had cleared up a little better
than four thousand dollars on this last trip
he believed he could sell his outfit right
there in timber city for another thousand
and if he could get back to salt lake it
would be the best investment he could pos-
sibly make for further information he
sought out the man who had brought in the
mail

  man i wouldnt undertake the trip out
of here this winter for all the gold dust in
timber city declared the man should
you happen to git over the mountains youve
still hundreds o miles t make there
might be somebody at fort hall but you
cant depend on findin help till ye git to
calls fort nearly t salt lake its at-
temptin suicide

  cheney thought it over carefully no
one knew the perils of a mountain trail in
the winter time better than he on the
other hand losing the accumulation of years
of hard and dangerous toil was not pleasant
to contemplate he had pulled through
some mighty tight places in his time sur-
mounted obstacles that looked far greater
than those now confronting him

  - i must be gittin old he mut-
tered to himself there was a time when
i wouldnt a hesitated a minute at a thing
like this

  it was foreordained that he should make
the attempt one thing alex cheney had
never suffered from was remorse of con-
science for having supinely bowed his head
to the storms of adversity it was too late
for him to begin now two hours after the
mail carrier arrived he had begun negotia-
tions for the sale of his outfit

  it was three days before he was able to
close the deal for enough money to save his
business and without it there was no use
for him to start every hours delay meant
danger in selling his stock he had re-
served but one rugged black mule in addi-
tion to lisbeth who of course had never
figured in the deal

  spose yuhll be wantin t buy a good
saddle horse t carry yuh out now sug-
gested the man who had bought his outfit
theres several good horses here thats
grain fed

  no ill ride lisbeth shes grain fed
too cheney answered

  the man laughed

  that miserable ole white mule yuh got
propped up in that stable t keep her from
failin down

  she aint fell plumb down yet alex
said grimly

  within an hour it was known throughout
the camp that alex cheney intended to ride
his old white mule other men with the
best intentions in the world tried in vain to
dissuade him it would they contended

require the strongest horse in the camp to
get over the mountains to say nothing of
the long trail over the desert to his final
destination but cheney was adamant

  alex was a marvel at packing by some
sort of wizardry he was able to get every
necessity for the trip and two packs of oats
for the mules as well on the big black mule
he had packed up in front of the chief store
in the town and there was a crowd of loafers
on hand to give him advice to which he paid
no attention soon he was all ready to
start except for saddling lisbeth and get-
ting two small sacks from the storekeepers
safe

  he had left lisbeth standing at a tie-
rack while packing the other mule and when
he had finished he walked over and led
her to the front of the store the crowd

adventure

suddenly roared with laughter and alex
flushed angrily

  he enjoyed a joke as much as any man
even when it was on himself but this sudden
amusement at lisbeths appearance aroused
his ire it was true that she had turned
white but she was sleek and well fed he
knew that her gait was only slightly less
springy than it had been in her youth her
courage and ambition had not decreased one
whit and he firmly believed that she would
come nearer to getting through than any
other animal in the camp why then
should these dubs split their sides with
laughing at her

  the laughter continued and alex noted
sly digs and remarks directed at lisbeth
he straightened up to have it out with the
loudest offender and his eye chanced to fall
on lisbeths snowy right side the reason
for the hilarity was suddenly explained
written along her side from hip to neck in
sticky irremovable black wagon-tar were
these words

im old but im awfully
tough

  the wag who had played the practical
joke had certainly seen to it that the words
were clearly defined and that they would
stay there a long time

  a slow grin overspread cheneys face

  truer words than them there was never
wrote he remarked as he threw the saddle
on lisbeth just the same there was a
slight resentment in his heart for the joke
was intended as an aspersion of his pet

  he went into the store and returned with
the two small sacks each weighing about
fifteen pounds he placed one in each sad-
dle bag and balanced them nicely then he
swung into the saddle while some wag pre-
dicted that lisbeth would break in two un-
der the weight of cheney and the two bags
of gold dust he had made no effort to
conceal the fact that he was taking his dust
out with him it would have been useless in
the first place and he felt safe anyway he
knew there were men in timber city who
would have taken great pleasure in relieving
him of the gold and they would not hesitate
to kill him to do it but he felt that the
winter and the dangers of the trail afforded
the best protection he could get

he reined lisbeth lightly through the
crowd and with the big black pack-mule at

his heels turned his back upon timber city

  he camped that night under a cluster of
tall tamaracks thirty miles from timber
city it was still early but he had no de-
sire to overdo his mules on the first end of
the trail he fed them a handful of oats
each necked the black mule to lisheth who
he knew would never stray far from camp
and taking his rifle wandered up the creek
to try for a shot at some kind of game he
had figured on killing his meat until he
got through the mountains to avoid extra
weight on his pack-mule and he knew that
game was plentiful

he had not gone a quarter of a
mile when he sighted a fat year-
ling buck unconcernedly browsing
on the tender twigs of a green
willow bush it was an easy shot and he
hungered for venison a hind quarter
would not add any appreciable weight to
the pack and it would go a long way if the
deep snow which he might possibly en-
counter should prevent further hunting

  he rested his rifle on the low limb of a
tree and drew a careful bead before he
pressed the trigger there was no report
and the buck continued its placid browsing
wonderingly alex ejected the cartridge and
threw in another with the same result he
was proud of his new winchester and the
shining cartridges which he had brought
with him from salt lake they had never
failed him before he tried one more and
when the expected concussion failed to occur
he rasped out an oath that sent the startled
buck flying headlong through the timber

  deliberately then he tried one cartridge
after another until he made sure that they
were all bad each and every one had been
tampered with and the powder removed
since he carried his own reloading outfit
with the wagons and every cartridge had
been reloaded one or more times there were
scratches on them which had prevented his
observing that they had been tampered with

  he stood still in his tracks and pondered
he knew that whoever had drawn the
powder had done so after he reached timber
city he considered the possibility of its
being a practical joke on the order as the
one played on lisbeth but rejected that
idea immediately sending a man un-
armed into the wilderness in that day when
bandits and hostile indians abounded was
too serious a matter for any one to consider
lisbeth



a joke there was some other motive-
there had to be

  his mind flashed at once to the gold in
his saddle bags

  with sudden fear gripping him he turned
and ran the entire distance to his camp
the mules had finished their oats and were
grazing a few rods from camp everything
was as he had left it in a few seconds he
was his usual cool self

  he did not minimize the dangers of his
situation he had not the least doubt that
he would be followed and he had no means
of defending himself furthermore he had
calculated rather freely upon provisioning
himself with his rifle and if he kept on he
was pretty likely to run short to go back
to timber city was not to be thought of
if he was really being followed he would
be intercepted and killed before he could
get back and even if he had known he
could get back there he would not have con-
sidered the possibility of a retreat he
simply was not that kind and he had lost
more time now than he liked to think about

  he brought his mules to camp and re-
saddled lisbeth regarded him wonder-
ingly but cheerfully out of her placid brown
eyes

  hate to do it old girl he assured her
but we got to lay a lot o miles between us
an whoever is on our trail

   within half an hour it was dark but alex
possessed an uncanny ability to stay on a
road which he had once been over and his
sense of direction was as accurate as a com-
pass without hesitation he kept lisbeth
at her fast running walk with the big mule
lumbering along behind at a jog trot

  it was midnight before he stopped
turned loose his mules and rolled into his
blankets without supper for this he had
a double reason he did not want to risk a
fire yet and knowing that his grub would
run short he proposed to ration himself from
the beginning

  there were certain things in his favor
when he came to consider the situation
calmly the outlaws would hardly dare
to leave timber city the same day he did
for fear that their reason for doing so would
be guessed and a posse formed to pursue
them they would likely slip out of town
immediately after dark but he was sure
they would not dare to crowd him too hard
for fear of stumbling upon him in the dark
they probably hoped to get close enough to

see his fire and then circle around him the
next day and head him off

  by discovering so soon what they were
up to getting a good lead and not building
a fire he hoped not only to gain on his pur-
suers but puzzle them unless they took
the time and trouble to track his mules the
absence of a fire might lead them to suspect
that he had taken some cut off and so cause
them to lose time in speculation knowing
that he had a thirty-five mile lead and know-
ing that he was being followed gave him such
an advantage that he felt he ought to keep
it one thing only caused him misdoubts-
lisbeth

  to doubt her ability seemed almost like
heinous disloyalty but this sudden un-
looked for crisis caused him to look at facts
squarely unblinded by the false light of
sentimentality she was no longer what
she had been in planning the trip he had
figured out to a nicety how to conserve her
energy no animal that he knew could
cover so many miles in a day at a running
walk and it was at that pace which he ex-
pected to keep her most of the time no
day would be too long for her at that gait

  but now he knew that he would be fol-
lowed by the best saddle horses in the
country and the outlaws would set a desper-
ate pace to overhaul him to keep ahead
he would have to force lisbeth to far greater
speed than he had planned and age even in
mules had not the recuperating power of
youth it was going to be a close race and
he realized that grim death awaited him if
he lost

  at daybreak he caught the mules again
and got under way with no other breakfast
for himself than two hard biscuits he
found himself almost immediately at the
foot of a long rather steep hill that led to the
top of the first divide it was utterly ex-
posed for lack of timber and he knew the
men behind him-if there really were men
behind him-would possess eagle eyes

  it was climbing a hill like this where
lisbeth was at her best with her running
walk to urge her faster than that was
sheer abuse and he knew it nevertheless he
felt that this time it was necessary the
slope was covered with a sprinkling of gravel
and by leaving the trail or road the tracks
they would leave would be hard to follow
but if that bit of strategy was to have any
results worth while they must not be seen
so he put lisbeth into her jackrabbit lope


adventure

and held her to it most of the time while they
zigzagged up to the top of the divide the
black mule led easily but both were blowing
hard when they reached the top of the di-
vide alex paused just a moment to look
back for any sign of his pursuers but seeing
none rode on

  they now had steep down-going for seven
or eight miles then the road led through a
canon a distance of ten miles to where it
widened out into a valley some twenty
miles long and ten or twelve wide they
encountered a light sift of snow on top of
the divide and it grew deeper rather than
less as they advanced down the canon if
the bandits came to the top of the divide
alex knew that his endeavor to throw them
off the trail would be wasted

  he allowed lisbeth to take her rapid
walk down the steeper part of the trail but
when he struck the canon he again put her
once more into a lope then the valley
opened up before him and he paused for
a moment of deliberation while his mules
blowed the valley was smooth save for a
growth of scrubby sage the wagon road
such as it was traversed the entire length
o the valley to the upper end a distance
of twenty miles there was grave danger
that the bandits would sight him before he
reached the other end

  there was no snow on the floor of the val-
ley but he could see where it began at the
upper end and from there the trail led up
and up into higher and higher mountains
if instead of following the road he should
dash straight across the valley he would
probably be able to reach the protection of
the fringe of timber that skirted it from end
to end

  he could hide there until he made sure
that he was really being followed and when
the bandits discovered that he had not gone
out of the valley they might return to
where he now stood to hunt for him or his
tracks at any rate he would have them
guessing on the other hand if it was to be
a straightaway race he would do better to
take the shortest route possible

  it was lisbeth who decided him to try to
out-guess his enemies she was cheerful as
ever her big ears were wagging eagerly as
they always did when she was ready to go
ahead but he noticed that the muscles of
her shoulders were quivering involuntarily
from the hard ride he had given her also
she was breathing harder than bee the

other mule he feared that if he loped her
for twenty miles across the floor of the val-
ley she would not be able to stand the strain
of holding her own

  the ground was frozen hard and covered
with thick dry bunch grass his mules for
all that they were shod left not a trace of
their tracks the valley for all that it
looked smooth from a general view proved
to be uneven and chopped up into tiny hills
and ravines that made remarkably hard
going for the mules but lisbeth did not
falter nor did she once break her steady
mile-eating lope she was covered with
sweat and lather and pufiing hard when they
finally reached the shelter of the timber on
the other side her shoulders were quivering
violently but she had not tried to lag and
the big black mule had

  they had struck the timber exactly where
a tiny stream meandered out of the hills
alex swung off stripped the saddles from
the mules and while they drank brushed
lisbeths lathery back with a handful of
dry grass

  ole girl yore a brick he told her
now yuh rest up an load up with bunch
grass while i see what i can see

he climbed up to the top of a
pinnacle several hundred yards
above where he had unsaddled
which commanded a fairly good
view of the entire valley naturally his eyes
turned first to the mouth of the canon
which he had recently quitted-and he saw
three horsemen congregated at the spot
where he had paused to deliberate slowly
he dropped his spy-glass and a grim look
settled over his face

  at least the uncertainty was past he
knew now what to expect-death if he was
overtaken the men following him could
not afford to take chances on letting their
victim live raising his glass again he saw
two of the men gallop along the road while
the third man fell in behind driving five ex-
tra horses besides their mounts and pack
animals they had brought along extra saddle
horses at the pace they were setting alex
knew that it would have been next to im-
possible for him to have kept ahead of
them

  he waited until the men ahead were half-
way across the valley and then he returned
to his mules when he called lisbeth came
eagerly to him dragging the pack mule with
lisbeth



with her he gave them a small feedof
oats and while they ate he resaddled

   theres mighty long odds agin ye ole
girl he confided to lisbeth we could
put back to the mouth o that canon an git
back to timber city before they could
ketch us but we never did let nothin scare
us out an i aint in favor o beginnin now
how bout you ole lady

  lisbeth waggled her ears in complete
 agreement

  picking his way carefully through the
timber alex followed a course almost parallel
with that taken by the bandits the wagon
road traversed the center of the valley and
he soon found that he was traveling almost
abreast of the man driving the horses it
did not require the aid of his glass now to
keep this fellows movements under surveil-
lance indeed his problem was to hug the
timber close enough not to be seen himself
frequently this involved tedious detours
where the timber receded far up some cove
or canon gradually the man with the
horses drew ahead and then alex frequently
cut straight across in the open

   it had been bitterly cold that morning
but the temperature had been rising steadily
owing to his absorption in watching the
movements of his enemies he had failed
to note the change in the weather until
something moist struck him in the face
with an oath he suddenly took note that
the air behind him was full of feathery snow-
flakes within five minutes the view ahead
of him for more than a few hundred feet
was blotted out by the light dry snow that
fell soundlessly

   as long as it continued to snow it would
not be so bad it might even prove to be a
good thing as it would cover the mules
tracks almost as fast as they appeared but
when it quit snowing as he was sure it soon
would their tracks would betray them

   he turned into the first sheltered cove
unsaddled and made camp he was deter-
mined to make what use he could of the
snowstorm and soon he had a fire going and
coffee in the pot at least there was no im-
mediate danger of the smoke betraying him
by the time he had eaten his first cooked
meal since leaving timber city it had
ceased to snow the whole valley lay under
a thin blanket of white but in the thin clear
air it was possible to see clear across it once
more

   he decided that for the present the best

thing was to remain where he was rather
than to leave more tracks for the outlaws to
pick up again he climbed to the top of a
pinnacle but this time he could not quite
see the place where the wagon road left the
valley at last however he saw the man
who ad been driving the horses this
time however he was going back and he
was only driving two horses

  for a short time alex was puzzled and
then comprehension dawned upon him this
fellow was going back to where the road en-
tered the valley the other two had remained
at the place where the road left it they
knew by the tracks he had left that he had
entered the valley and by the absence of
them at the upper end they knew that he
had never left it the had him bottled up
for the granite walls of the canon excepting
these two breaks were unscalable

  there was nothing for him to do now but
wait for night and the kind of night it was
to be would perhaps mean everything to
him if only it would be dark and stormy
he would stand a good chance of getting by
the outlaws without detection but if it
was cold and clear-

  long before night he knew which it was
going to be the last remaining cloud had
settled just above the west bank of hills a
cold penetrating wind was finding its way
through his clothing and making him stamp
up and down to keep warm it would be a
cold clear night he could not build a fire
for there was not a doubt in the world but
that his enemies were watching for that very
thing to stay where he was and consume
his small store of provisions and court
further delay was likewise impossible

  at nightfall he saddled up again and
worked his way carefully up the edge of the
valley until he was within half a mile of the
canon by which the road left the valley
here he left the mules and reconnoitered
carefully on foot in a narrow place in the
canon where it was really not more than six
rods wide he saw the camp of the outlaws
there were several dead fir trees there-he
remembered having camped by them when
he came in-and a huge fire had been built
at the foot of them one of the standing
trees pitchy nearly to the top was a mass
of flame for sixty feet the whole bottom
of the canon was illuminated and the
flickering flame from the burning tree at
times lighted the entire south wall of the
canon


adventure

then something near the top of
the canon caught his eye by the
aid of memory and the flicker-
ing fire light he was able to get
in his mind a fairly good idea of the ledge
that ran along the wall of the canon just un-
der the top on that side as he remembered
it that ledge ended in a steep draw a quar-
ter of a mile up the canon which his mules
could negotiate only a mule or a mountain
sheep could cling to that narrow ledge but
if he could once get them on it he believed he
could make it but first he determined to
investigate it himself

  he had to cross the canon below where
the two men were sitting by their fire but
so long as they remained within its glare
they could not see him he could tell from
their attitude that they had no fear of him
getting past them to his relief he found
that it would be an easy matter to get his
mules on to the ledge but he dared not take
the chance of reaching some impossible ob-
stacle where they might have to turn back
and so he continued on afoot at one place
he was almost directly over the heads of the
two men by the fire but the very glare of it
was his best protection unless the flaming
fir tree should suddenly send a higher beam
of light that might reveal him he passed
this spot on hands and knees keeping as
close to the canon wall as he could hug

  this danger passed he paused and looked
down he recognized the outlaws below
as tough characters he had seen hanging
around timber city saloons one of them
he had also known in virginia city so he
knew he was not mistaken about their char-
acter then he continued on until he
reached the draw at the end of the ledge

  could the mules make it he did not
know there were places where the ledge
was not more than three feet wide nor
was it always a flat shelf of rock there were
places where it sloped downward at an acute
angle that would have made a cat scratch to
stay on and below was a perpendicular drop
of a hundred or more feet but such places
were short and he believed the mules could
scramble over them a horse never could
this he did know that it was positively the
only way to get past the outlaws

  he returned along the ledge as cautiously
as he had come and went back to his mules
he dared not make the attempt until the
fire in the pitchy fir tree had died down but
in the meantime there was work to be done

rearranging the pack on the bee mule it
now projected far out from her sides and it
had to be built high and narrow else it
would push her off at any one of the narrow
places along the ledge at last this was ac-
complished and he moved back as close to
the end of the ledge as he dared once
more he reconnoitered on foot and found
one man asleep the other standing guard
he had hoped that he might have a chance
to stampede their horses but they had been
picketed just above the camp in the canon

  he saw that the pitch in the fir tree had
burned out but tongues of flame still licked
at the stalwart trunk and might continue to
do so for days he decided that he might
as well make the attempt first as last for in
the morning the outlaws would certainly
discover his tracks and if he was successful
in making his escape they would at once be
on his trail again

  when repacking he had also torn the
canvas cover of the pack into eight strips
which he had bound carefuly over the mules
feet it would last long enough to muffle
the ringing of their iron shoes over the hard
rock of the ledge a more nervous man
would have walked and led the mules but
alex knew that there might be times when
quickness alone could save the mules and
there would be more danger of disaster with
him in front unable to get out of their way
than if he was riding

  sniffing softly lisbeth reluctantly set her
canvas covered feet on to the narrow ledge
the bee mule at first refused to follow but
after she was once persuaded on to it she
pressed hard on lisbeths heels in her ter-
ror with dark towering cliffs above an
abyss with leaping flames beneath and the
most precarious footing in the world under
their feet it was no wonder that the mules
seemed fairly to shrivel in their terror

  alex could hear the harsh grating of the
pack along the rock as bee crowded fran-
tically away from the edge he could
feel it ever so slightly with his own right leg
occasionally it would bump rather hard but
instantly lisbeth would swerve away in
all the years that he had ridden her lisbeth
had never yet bruised his legs when going
between trees for instance if there was not
room to get through without gouging her
riders legs she would not go through

  once as they rounded a turn on the ledge
the pack caught on the edge of a projecting
boulder there was a loud tearing sound
lisbeth



and then the rattle of camp utensils as bee
shot wildly ahead alex saw the man on
guard below spring to his feet and look
around wildly once more the pack rasped
against the rock and the fellow called to his
companion who leaped from his blankets
fully dressed

  alex was now approaching the point di-
rectly above the flaming fir tree he dared
not hesitate now for once the mens eyes
became accustomed to the shadows they
would almost surely be able to make out the
figures of the mules above their heads
with a light pressure of his heels against
lisbeths ribs he urged her forward and the
sapie moment almost a tongue of flame on
the dead fir leaped high making the ledge
for a distance of twenty feet as plain as day
it died down again instantly but not be-
fore alex heard the mens yell of discovery

  immediately there came the crack of a
rifle and a bullet spatted against the rock
directly over cheneys head the other
man began firing with his revolver and it
seemed to alex that bullets were fairly rain-
ing around him the least misstep on
lisbeths part he knew would send them
hurtling to their death she had quickened
her pace of her own accord to her fastest
running walk but he could also sense the
sureness of every step

  then he heard the bee mule give a fright-
ened snort there was a sound of feet
sliding over rock and the rope was jerked
from his hand glancing back over his
shoulder he barely glimpsed the black mule
disappearing over the rim a moment later
a hollow sound coming from near the base
of the burning fir floated up to him ac-
companied by triumphant yells from the
bandits

  git above im alex heard one of the
outlaws yell

  one chance alone remained to him-to
get off the ledge and into the road before
they could intercept him come on ole
girl he implored and pressed lisbeths
white sides harder with his heels she broke
into her slow lope

  it would have been dangerous enough in
daylight to turn a mans hair white and the
shift of snow on the rock made it yet more
dangerous cheneys hair stood on end
occasionally a foot slipped and once lis-
beth went down on her knees but with the
quickness of a cat she recovered and scram-
bled on and then almost before he knew

it they were in the steep draw at the end of
the ledge alex became aware that he had
been holding his breath for a length of time
that seemed ages

  they were quickly in the road again and
ahead of their pursuers but alex knew the
outlaws would quickly be saddled and on
his trail he was almost ready to pull up
and accept whatever fate the outlaws had in
store for him even if lisbeth had stamina
enough to keep ahead of the horses-and it
seemed an impossible thing to expect-they
were doomed anyway on account of the
loss of the pack mule with their supplies
to think of making a trip of hundreds of
miles with neither food nor weapons was like
the impossible optimism of a lunatic but
behind them were the outlaws and sure
death

  its up to you ole girl he whispered in
lisbeths big ear i aint a goin to urge
ye if ye feel like stoppin we will

  but apparently lisbeth sensed the men-
ace behind for she showed no disposition to
slacken her pace wherever it was possible
to do so she maintained her jackrabbit lope
and where it was too steep for that her
fast walking gait carried her swiftly to
the top

daylight found them well
into the highest range of moun-
tains they would have to encoun-
ter the snow on the level was
six or eight inches deep and near the tops of
the ridges there were drifts that frequently
were belly deep and in that high altitude
alex knew the weather could change sud-
denly it was cold now but it might be
snowing before noon he stopped lisbeth
and dismounted while she rested the out-
laws were not in sight but he knew the re-
spite would be brief clouds of steam were
arising from the old white mules hide her
shoulder muscles were quivering and she was
breathing hard

  alex tentatively hefted the saddle bags
and a wry bitter grin came on his face

  mebbe its a funny thing to say but i

wish t-i could trade this gold dust fer

the same weight in oats he murmured

  suddenly he caught sight of his pur-
suers little more than a mile behind him
the discovery was mutual for he saw the
leading outlaw wave jubilantly alex looked
at his old pet doubtfully in years gone
she would have had her wind back after


adventure

such a rest but now her heaving had scarce-
ly diminished

  well weve started this wed just as well
see it through he ejaculated suddenly and
swung into the saddle

  the outlaws were gaining and each of
them led a relief horse alex could see that
they were whipping mercilessly in an en-
deavor to end the chase at once and he was
compelled to ask lisbeth for more speed

  then the outlaws changed horses and de-
spite lisbeths best efforts alex saw that it
was the beginning of the end not much
longer could the aged mule maintain the
grading pace he looked at his watch and
was amazed to find that it was two oclock
in the afternoon at any rate lisbeth had
given the bandits a race that they would
long remember and she had justified his
faith in her but to save her further pun-
ishment he decided to give up

  and then he saw something ahead that
gave him an inspiration to his right
loomed a short steep canon leading to a
divide to the south the road continued in
the deeper canon they were in to the east
around a spur-range of mountains when
he had come in he had noted that if it were
possible to cross this spur-range a least a
hundred miles of road would be cut off he
had known however that wagons could
never traverse that route but now in their
desperate situation it might be worth their
while for him and lisbeth to make the at-
tempt

  the particular thing that influenced him
to make the attempt was the seeming in-
accessibility of this canon it was shut off
from the main canon by a barrier of cliffs
and loose shale rock extending clear across
the base but with one swift calculating
glance alex estimated lisbeths chance to
climb and gave her about one in three
one thing he did know was that if they could
make it no horse could follow  if they
failed well the chase might as well end
here as elsewhere

  he rode lisbeth to the very foot of it and
dismounted then giving her plenty of
rope he began the ascent carefully picking
a way where it was possible for her to fol-
low up and up they clambered until from
a great distance they must have resembled
two flies clinging to the sides of a wall
there were places where alex seized jutting
edges of rock to help himself along and
once he saved lisbeth from disaster only by

a quick turn of the rope around a projecting
rock which held her until she recovered her
balance

  the outlaws reached the foot of the
precipice just before alex and his mule
reached the top before they could use
their rifles alex struggled to the top and
bracing his feet surged back against the
lead rope and helped lisbeth over the last
obstruction

  alex was in no hurry to leave he led
lisbeth out of sight and returned to where
he could watch the two men below one of
them tried vainly to spur his horse up the
incline but was quickly compelled to give it
up the outlaws held a consultation and
then one of them began to climb the preci-
pice alex had gathered a dozen rocks the
size of apples and he waited grimly for the
fellow to come within reach a rock at that
range was as good as a bullet when the
fellow came within range he hurled a missile
that struck his man squarely in the chest
it broke his hold and the fellow rolled and
bounded to the bottom

  satisfied now that there would be no
further pursuit alex mounted his mule and
began a tortuous ascent of the canon wind-
ing in and out among the trees and dodging
unlooked for ledges of rock at dark he
stopped he had no fear of pursuit the
outlaws knowing well his predicament
would probably wait at the foot of the
canon for him to return well let them
he thought grimly there was no more to
be lost by going ahead than there was by
going back he unsaddled lisbeth and
turned her loose on a wind-swept ridge
where the grass stuck above the snow she
at least need not go hungry yet though he
well knew there was little strength in the
frozen grass

  he gathered dead limbs from fallen trees
and built a fire the warmth made him
forget his hunger and presently he fell
asleep from time to time he roused to
heap more wood on the fire but along
toward morning it began to snow and when
he finally awoke the fire was out and the
saddle blanket which covered him was
weighted down with three inches of snow

  he did not trouble to rebuild his fire but
caught lisbeth at once he threw the sad-
dle on her and mounted at noon they
reached the top of the divide it was still
snowing thus obscuring the view that lay
before him but alex knew that it was wild
lisbeth



and bad enough yet somewhere on the
other side of those mountains lay the desert
he dismounted to allow lisbeth to rest and
discovered that his fast had made him weak
for a moment he was the victim of despair
there was not one chance in a thousand that
they could ever get through why waste
themselves going on and then he realized
that to stop would only be to prolong the
inevitable end

  his eyes chanced to fall upon the bulging
saddle bags he laughed hollowly here
was poor old lisbeth being weighted down
by thirty odd pounds of useless gold dust
the best he could do was to relieve her of
that he wondered why he had not thought
to throw those sacks in the trail while the
outlaws were pursuing him it might have
raused them to be satisfied and then his
resentment against them flared up and he
was glad that he had not

  he took out one sack of the dust and laid
it on the snow almost absent-mindedly he
felt in the bottom of the saddle bag but he
suddenly jumped as though he had ex-
perienced an electric shock his fingers
had touched something round smooth and
hard his fingers trembled and shook as he
brought the cartridge into view he re-
membered then of having carelessly dropped
several of them into that saddle bag weeks
before when he had not cared to be burdened
with them in his pocket he reached in
again and brought forth three more shining
cylinders there was not the faintest sign
that they had been tampered with and he
was sure that they were good

  lisbeth ole girl we got a fightin chance
yet he told the old white mule

  he put the sack of dust back into the
saddle bag and again rode on but now he
carried his rifle across the saddle in front of
him and his eyes were alert for signs of
game it was snowing steadily the wind
was rising and he was forever being com-
pelled to wipe the snow out of his eyes that
he might see

  suddenly he sighted a pine hen on a low
branch of a tree he knew he could shoot
it but it would scarcely make a meal after
a desperate mental struggle he rode on with
his hunger increased tenfold but he knew
that he must have bigger game

  just before dark they reached the bottom
of a deep canon with a blizzard now sweep-
ing overhead there was shelter here in the
thick timber wood and water in abundance

  and what was of more account numerous
bushes with twigs so tender that lisbeth
could chew them

alex slipped the saddle off and
at once moved off up the canon
with his rifle if there was game
close he knew the storm would
bring it to the bottom of the canon for pro-
tection he was working his way against
the wind and it bothered him to see but
he dared not let the game get his scent in
the gathering twilight he saw a huge por-
cupine clinging to the limb of a pine he
knew that he must eat soon and there was
small chance of getting anything else he
took careful aim and fired he saw the
porcupine drop like a rock but the same
moment he was startled by a band of eight
deer that suddenly leaped from the brush
a short distance ahead of him and bounded
away through the snow

  he jerked in another cartridge and fired
at a fat doe but his haste and the snow
which half blinded him spoiled his aim he
saw her stumble but the next moment she
was up and plunging after the others
though he knew she was rather badly
wounded he knew how hopeless it would be
to try to follow her in the dark and the snow
would soon annihilate all tracks he had
to get her now or not at all once more he
aimed and fired it was a longer mark but
a better one this time the doe was dead

  he carried the doe back to where he had
left lisbeth and then returned for the por-
cupine he built a fire and dressed his kill
and then he dined sumptuously on porcu-
pine he had but one cartridge left but he
had a supply of meat that would last him
for days

  it was three days before they could leave
that camp with each hour the storm in-
creased in fury and alex skilled mountain-
eer that he was knew how futile it would be
to try to buck it he employed his time
making himself a pair of snowshoes out of
woven willows but his heart was heavy
when he thought of lisbeth how was she
to get out he almost expected to see re-
sentment or reproach in her soft brown
eyes but the aged veteran browsed placidly
as if without a care in the world but she
was no longer fat and sleek

  he felt that the most merciful thing he
could do would be to put an end to her
suffering with his last bullet but he knew


adventure

 that this would not do yet she would be
 able to flounder through the snow for a
 while and he needed her she could carry
 his remaining supply of meat for a while to
 say nothing of the gold dust and that one
 bullet might yet mean life or death to him

   then for three days more alex tramped
 his way through the snow and marveled that
 the intrepid old mule was able to follow him
 at times the going was comparatively easy
 for him where the crust was strong enough
 to hold him up but it would never bear
 lisbeths weight indeed it hampered her at
 every step

   they encountered drifts which it was im-
 possible for her to fight her way through
 when she had plunged until she could go no
 longer she would lay on her side and look at
 alex with a gaze of calm confidence and
 with an oath and sometimes with tears of
 desperation in his eyes he would set to work
 tramping down the drift until finally there
 would be a trail upon which she could wal-
 low through

   alex was eating discreetly and retaining
 his strength but they seldom encountered
 anything that lisbeth could feed on daily
 her master could see her growing weaker
 but there seerded no end to her stamina
 x long before this a younger animal would
 have quit he knew just as perhaps would
 a younger man in his shoes it was the pa-
 tience and experience of age that was carry-
 ing them both through once he tested her
 with a piece of roasted venison but she
 seemed to have forgotten the knack of eating
 meat which she had acquired so long ago
 knowing how very much he needed it him-
 self he did not insist

   they suddenly broke out of the moun-
 tains on to the floor of the desert but alex
 was doomed to disappointment where he
 had expected to find but little snow there
 was two feet on the level and crusted hard
 yet it was not quite strong enough to bear
 lisbeths weight now it seemed was the
 time to kill her but still he could not bring
 himself to do it he still had food and as
 long as she was able to travel at all he meant
 to stay with her

   they were three days reaching snake
 river lisbeth had somehow managed to
 keep herself alive by eating the tops of the
 sage and at night by pawing through the
 snow occasionally foraged a few mouthfuls
 of bunch grass alexs food supply was
 again exhausted

 they had reached the main montana
freight road but cheney knew only too well
that the freighters were not accustomed to
traversing its pitiless length in the winter
time his best bet was that he might en-
counter some belated traveler like himself
but he saw at once that there had been no
one over the road since the storm there
was one chance in a hundred that some one
might overtake him but the men most
likely to do that were the very outlaws he
had recently escaped from

  he was reasonably sure that the bandits
would not dare to return to timber city
neither was it likely that they would turn
north and try to buck the deep snows over
the continental divide this left them one
of two resources they must either turn
south on the road he was on or else make
for some secret outlaw hang-out in the
vicinity if they did turn south he knew
that excepting for some unusual adversity
they would soon be along for though their
route would be much longer than the one he
had taken they would make much better
time their horses would be fresher and
stronger and trail breaking would not be
so difficult for them since they could take
turns in the lead

  alex was brought face to face with the
stern necessity of making better time if
the outlaws were on his trail lisbeths trail
through the broken crust would lay an easy
course for them to follow and he could no
longer hope for the old white mule to keep
ahead of such overwhelming odds even if
not pursued by the outlaws he knew that he
could no longer afford to be held back by
lisbeth for whom the going became worse
with each successive mile

  the stern line of necessity to which he
knew he should closely hew was plainly
marked he was out of provisions he
had but one bullet left and a sharp knife
he ought to slit lisbeths old white throat
cook and eat part of her carcass and carry
with him as much as he could manage on his
improvised snowshoes if the crust held
he could thus without doubt make it
through to fort hall at any rate other-
wise he faced a fair assurance of starvation
for though he had one bullet left he had not
sighted game of any description since he
had struck the desert

  well he grumbled into his beard if
it has t be it has t be but i cant do it to-
night ill wait till mornin
lisbeth

i

  and he pressed on with lisbeth wearily
breaking through the crust behind him for
another two hours

that night he ate the last few
scraps of his venison and boiled
his saddle strings to eke out the
meal for the first time in their
arduous journey lisbeth made no effort to
obtain food for herself she tramped out a
place through the crust large enough to lie
down in and dropped on her side through
the long weary hours while he gathered
dead willows to heap upon his fire alex con-
templated her with remorseful eyes

  toward morning he fell into a doze and
when he awoke a red discouraged looking
sun was sending slanting rays of slight heat
across the unyielding surface of the snow
lisbeth had got to her feet and was pawing
about the roots of willow bush from which
she occasionally extracted a mouthful of dry
grass as he came toward her determinedly
with his keen bladed knife in his hand her
big ears shot forward kindly and she greeted
him with the old familiar bray

 --he muttered i cant do it-not

with a knife anyway

  he knelt down on the fire-dried ground
and considered he had one bullet and it
was sufficient to do the business after all
he could carry mule meat enough to last him
to fort hall and if he did not find any one
there to give him aid his case was hopeless
anyway he might just as well waste the
bullet here and put lisbeth forever out of
her misery he brought his rifle to his
shoulder and squinted along the sights to the
exact center of her forehead lisbeths ears
came up in mild curiosity alex knew that
the old mule knew the death dealing prop-
erties of a gun and her placid confidence
was entirely too much for him he dropped
the butt of the rifle into the snow with a
curse

  id be a- cowardly murderer now t

kill ye ole girl after all these years we put
in together he jerked out

  he threw his arm around her neck and
rubbed his be-whiskered face along the soft
white hair on her jaw a spasm of weak-
ness that beginning in his troubled mind
communicated itself to his body caused him
to throw all his weight on the old mules
neck and presently he noted that she was
holding him up

  aint all in yet are yuh lisbeth he

marveled well i cant take ye with me
no farthur an i simply aint got the heart t
kill ye the only thing left is t leave ye
behind there aint one chance in seven
million fer ye t pull through the winter but
at least yuh can die a natral death-unless
the wolves git ye-an thats more in the
nature of a mule

  a mile away and nearer to the river he
could see what looked to be a swamp and
swamps frequently had grass

  come on he said almost gruffly that
may be a better place t leave yuh than
this is

  as he approached the swamp he saw that
it was really an island in the river it was
covered over with willow clumps now bent
over and loaded down with snow till they
resembled innumerable little snow mounds
or igloos with here and there tall alders pro-
jecting nakedly in the air

  the river was frozen over and they had
no difficulty reaching the island alex was
disappointed for there was not a blade of
grass in sight and the snow seemed deeper
and crusted harder than in any place he had
yet encountered but they had been an
hour and a half coming that mile and he
could not delay longer

  he had tried to bring himself to kill the
old white mule and failed he was not the
man to waste time fighting the battle over
again he stripped saddle and hackamore
from lisbeth and left her free for a mo-
ment he stood over the saddle bags ponder-
ing it seemed the part of reason to conceal
the two bags of gold dust there on the island
and go on as lightly loaded as possible but
he was a man of dogged persistence he had
set out for the sole purpose of saving his
business what would it profit him if he
did get through and then had to see it go to
smash for lack of this gold resolving that
if he got through at all it would not be in
vain he stooped and lifted the sacks of the
saddle bags

  if id killed ole lisbeth id a loaded my-
self down heavier than this he reconciled
himself as he made a pack bag of a single
blanket into which he slung the dust then
with his rifle in his hand he marched away

  since the river was frozen he decided to
follow it from time to time he meant to
crawl to some elevation and inspect the
road if any one was coming he would see
them if the outlaws he could hide if any one
else he could make his presence known


adventure

  only once did he look back lisbeth was
still standing where he had left her her
long ears were pointed straight ahead and
he knew that she was trying to figure out the
reason for his desertion a hot sob came
into his throat he waved his hand as he
would at a fellow traveler and rounding a
bend in the river disappeared from sight

 for two hours lisbeth stood where
cheney had left her looking toward the
place where her master had disappeared
then at last she turned her head and gazed
at the saddle which she had carried for so
many hundred miles she heaved a deep
breath that was almost a sigh and began to
move

  she had no intention of following alex
for the saddle represented camp and she had
learned long ago not to stray far from it
neither did she doubt that alex would re-
turn she began to paw in the little circle
of tramped down snow her little feet
with the thin wafer-like iron shoes sent
snow flying in all directions but they un-
covered no grass what they did encounter
was an uneven surface of ice late in the
fall the island which was really a swamp
had in most places been under water it
had frozen hard then snowed thawed and
frozen again such grass as there was was
protected by an armor of ice

  hour after hour lisbeth pawed patiently
at the ice occasionally she obtained a few
spears of rank grass as a reward for her
efforts but not nearly enough to compen-
sate for the energy required to get them
gradually she widened the circle around
her but that was hard work

  along toward night she determined to try
a large willow bush that she could see fifty
feet away the edge of the crust was
breast high bands of horses have been
known to starve rather than attempt to
conquer such an obstruction but not
lisbeth she reared up until her front feet
were above the edge and lunged forward
with all her strength the crust collapsed
under her weight and she came down on her
side but in a moment she was up repeat-
ing the maneuver and with each lunge she
gained a few feet

  but unfortunately for the poor old mule
the willow bush was hardly worth the effort
it was water-killed and its branches were
bare and destitute of bark in dry sticks
there was no nourishment-even for mules

  the cold that night was intense a hard

wind sprang up from the northwest and
despite the hard scintillating surface of the
crust a fine powdery snow was picked up
somewhere by the wind and driven along
with such force that the tiny particles
struck the old mules hide and stung like
innumerable pin pricks

  lisbeth got behind the willow bush as
best she could and humped her back to the
storm morning found her cold weak and
miserable death was preferable to fur-
ther exertion but in lisbeths mulish
make-up was an indomitable courage that
could not accept defeat so long as there was
the possibility of victory at first when
she began to move her legs were stiff and
unwieldy as stilts but after several fruitless
attempts to break trail they became more
pliable and she was again able to go for-
ward

  night found her nearly half a mile from
where alex had left her and she had lo-
cated a patch of young second growth wil-
lows from whose bark she was able to obtain
some slight nourishment despite the fact
that her teeth had been worn short and
smooth by the years

        then suddenly her big ears
shot forward eagerly she had
hearl the sound of mens voices
but it was not alexs voice that
she heard and so she waited where she was
soon two men came forward on foot she
could see another man farther back with
some horses

  theres his mule one of the men ex-
claimed now what dye make of it

  what gits me said the other man is
how he was able t git this fur without grub
an without bullets an on that miserable
ole white mule besides reckon though
hungers got him an hes gone loco an
wandered off

  loco sneered the first speaker not

so--loco that he didnt know enough

t take them sacks o gold dust with
him

  mebbe he thro wed them away long ago
t lighten pack suggested the other

  lighten nothin i know cheney
whatever he undertakes hell stick to it to
the end the truth is the old mule give out
an he took the dust an went on in a desper-
ate chance to reach fort hall he cant a
been gone long an as we know the fix he
was in he must be awful weak the
lisbeth



question is do we foller him toward fort hall
or head direct for dutchys hang-out

  foot or hoss-back-if we try to foller
em

  horses eight horses an three men
ought to make better time than one man
afoot replied the dominant man in the
party lucky for us we still got them two
extra sacks of oats that rolled off that ledge
with cheneys black mule theyll keep
our horses alive till we reach dutchys-it
cant be more than twenty-five miles from
here-an after that we dont care what be-
comes of em

  neither of the outlaws noticed lisbeths
long ears shoot forward at the mention of
oats but the word carried a distinct mean-
ing to the old white mule come git yer
oats was a phrase of alexs which she had
long understood perfectly

  the men turned back on the trail which
she had wallowed down as if not deigning
her worthy of further notice presently
the cheerful smell of smoke assailed her
nostrils she knew the men were making
camp where she had been unsaddled and
something was urging her strongly to follow
them back and yet when she drew close
she sensed something alien or perhaps
various experiences of hers around camps
where alex was not present to protect her
came to her remembrance for lisbeth
for all her good qualities had been so petted
and pampered by her master that she had
become a veritable camp nuisance at any
rate she hung back in the darkness until the
three men around the camp fire had spread
out their blankets and rolled in

  some fifty feet back of the camp she could
see the huddled horses of the outlaws
they had been given a small feed of oats
each enough to keep them alive and left
tied up because there seemed nothing else
for them to eat still she waited until
only a few smoldering embers of the fire
remained before she actually invaded the
camp ground of the outlaws and then as
she glided noiselessly forward her white
form against the background of snow was
as invisible as a ghost to the casual eye

  two objects lying close to the pack
saddles and at the very foot of the bed
where the three outlaws were sleeping to-
gether held most but not quite all of her
attention as she moved forward the ear
next to the sleeping men was cast warily
backward and her right eye that next to

the men seldom strayed far from the bed
a long upper lip nuzzled tentatively at one
of the sacks of oats but the mouth of it was
tied hard and fast then her mouth was
pressed hard against the burlap until a fold
of it was between her teeth slowly the
sack was swung aloft

  lisbeth turned softly and carried the oat
sack some twenty feet away where she de-
posited it lightly upon the snow placing
one small front foot on it firmly she surged
back with her teeth there was a rending
ripping sound and the oat sack gaped open
with an eighteen-inch slit in the middle
lisbeths jaws were rammed straight into
the sack as far as she could possibly crowd
them when she lifted her head her mouth
was so full of oats that it could not possibly
contain them and as she swung her head
around to regard the bed she sowed oats in a
thick half circle

  she stopped crunching abruptly one of
the men in bed had suddenly rolled over and
lifted his head had the fellow sighted her
lisbeth would have been shot without
further ceremony but it was the horses who
perhaps saved her with better eye-sight
than the man they had seen what was going
on and the tearing of the sack carried full
knowledge to them hungry as they were
they began to move and stamp impatiently
apparently satisfied that it was only the
uneasiness of the horses that had disturbed
him the man resumed his rest

  then in utter silence save for the steady
crunching of her strong but aged jaws lis-
beth ate as she had not eaten for many
days strength came back to her with
amazing rapidity occasionally the folds
of the depleted sack got in her way and she
worried it this way and that until she could
get at the oats no thought of the morrow
troubled her for after all lisbeth was a mule
and economic foresight is not a mulish gift
no more did her conscience prick her for
robbing the all-but-starving horses

  presently that sack of oats was empty
most of its contents had been scattered and
trampled deep into the snow and lisbeth
was still unsatisfied more boldly now than
she had approached before she made her
way to the pack saddles lifted and de-
spoiled the remaining sack as she had done
the first but when it was finally empty
lisbeth had eaten all that she cared to
she wondered furtively whether she should
not investigate the mens grub supply where


adventure

it reposed by the dead ashes of their camp
fire

  had she been the least bit hungry at the
time she would have made her exploration
thorough but as it was she was content to
tumble things about in the snow promis-
cuously then her innate caution was
awakened and she withdrew some distance
back the way she had come

  with renewed life and vigor she deviated
somewhat from the trail and forced her way
resolutely under one of the great bent over
willow bushes at last she had found a dry
place and one that was sheltered from the
wind with a sigh of content she lay down

  she was awakened presently by the blood-
chilling melancholy howling of a wolf pack
one that undoubtedly had followed the trail
of the outlaws out of the mountains it
was close at hand and there was such a
ferocious note of baffled rage in their cry
that lisbeth leaped to her feet and stood
shivering but she did not leave her
shelter and presently when the clamor sub-
sided she lay down again

  daybreak found three furious outlaws
rendering the air with profanity while they
contemplated the torn empty oat sacks and
their own scattered soaked grub they
could gather up their grub and they did
finding it wet but still eatable but it was
hopeless to think of gathering up the oats
that lisbeth had wasted and oats were
more important to them than their own
food their horses were in a half starving
condition already and now they had noth-
ing whatever to feed them

  it was that -- miserable camp-rob-
bin ole skate of a white mule that done
this look at them tracks raged one of
the outlaws

  it was true that the evidence admitted of
no doubt as to who the guilty party had
been

  -if i dont shoot her right now the

same outlaw swore but the man who led
the party intervened

  dont fly off the hanle that man ad-
monished this here is serious we got to
decide what to do

  well i was goin t do somethin the
other retorted angrily

  it leaves us in one - of a predica-
ment the leader went on unheeding the
others burst of temper if we go on
after cheney an hes got any lead at all
on us these scadsll give out on us theyll

never be able t reach fort hall even if you
cared to go there an every mile we go after
cheney takes us that much farther from
dutchys

  he looked at his two partners now sud-
denly sobered by his blunt statement of the
case and as they offered no suggestions he
continued

  far as im concerned id like the fun of
knockin cheney on the head an appro-
priatin that dust but i aint cravin to die
of starvation or freezin to death the
best thing we can do is line out for dutchys
well make these horses take us as far as
they can an then well have to go the rest
of the way on foot

  the other outlaws saw the futility of
arguing the point they agreed readily
enough with the leader but the one who
had made threats against lisbeth started
down the trail after her at the place where
she had left it he stopped and scanned the
snow for sight of her and overlooked her
hiding place

  -- he said i just as well let her
starve t death or let the wolves take her
as t wade through that snow

  a half hour later the outlaws went on
across the island and turned north toward
the hang-out of their friend dutchy and
alex cheney struggling along to the south
never knew that he was spared beingover-
taken by his enemies only by the despoiling
of two sacks of oats by lisbeth

as for lisbeth herself she
watched the men out of sight and
then she returned to their camp
she was more thirsty than she
was hungry and she began to wolf down
great mouthfuls of snow where the oats had
been spilled with each mouthful she ob-
tained a few oats and by the time her thirst
was slaked she was not particularly hungry

  she pawed and nosed about the camp-
ground for fifteen or twenty minutes then
suddenly her head went up and her skin
began to grow cold a quarter of a mile
back the baffled wolf pack had sighted her
and sounded the hunting cry the pack
was hungry for the unprecedented hard
winter had spoiled their hunting there
was fury and determination in their deep
baying and written plain in their little
fierce blood-shot eyes

  in sudden dread lisbeth realized her
aloneness and turned and fled the leader
lisbeth



  the pack was scarcely two hundred yards
behind and his followers seven in number
more strung along behind her flight
brought a louder more exultant note into
the pack cry she fairly dived under the
bent-over willow that had sheltered her be-
fore instantly she spun around and faced
her enemies

  she had short time to wait the leader
of the pack was wisely skirting the trail she
had made and staying on the crust with-
out hesitation he threw himself into the trail
and dashed head-long under the willow bush
after his victim lisbeth squealed in ter-
ror and then her right front foot shot up in
the air the smoothly worn iron shoe
glinted in the air like silver and then it came
down squarely on top of the wolfs head
smashing his skull like an egg-shell

  the leader lay flattened and harmless
before the next wolf arrived and seeing him
thus confidence came back to the old white
mule in a rush she was better prepared
for the next one when he bolted in but her
last blow was only a glancing one the
wolf whined with pain and sprang for her
throat she reared until her ears struck
the roof of her willow shed and both feet
drove downward upon the wolfs back he
went down crippled and helpless again
and again she struck and the other wolves
now aware that they had a battle on their
hands slid to a stop snarling and snapping
the foam driveling from their slavering jaws

  they encircled her and a wolf launched
an attack from the rear to ham-string her
lisbeth doubled herself into a knot and
lashed out with both hind feet the wolf
was kicked twenty feet as dead as the two
leaders of the pack some of them climbed
to the top of the willow shed in an attempt
to reach her back at first the thick crust
of the snow resisted them but they began
to gnaw through it then suddenly it
gave way and a heavy wolf dropped through
the snow onto the sprangled willows which
gave him no footing nor yet parted enough
to let him through he gave a startled yelp
of fear and fought and clambered until he
had got back to safety his struggles had
caused the others to withdraw and with a
sudden rush they all attacked the body of
the wolf lisbeth had kicked out on the
snow

  it was nearly dark when they returned to
the siege of lisbeth but their stomachs
were full and none of them had the hardi-

hood to brave those death-dealing feet
lisbeth moved constantly so that she could
watch both openings she could hear them
for a while snarling and snapping over the
remnants of the carcass of the dead wolf on
the outside and then the sounds grew more
remote but not once during the long
night did her vigilance relax

  morning came and there was no sign of
the wolf pack with the keen edge of their
hunger taken off they had withdrawn to-
ward the mountains from which they had
been lured by the outlaws with a disdain-
ful sniff at the bodies of the two dead
wolves which had been with her all night
she stepped from her shelter and gazed
around she sensed at once a change in the
weather it had turned warmer and soft
fleecy clouds were floating lightly through a
sky that was no longer hard as brass

  she was thirsty and she went back to the
camp-ground and again absorbed snow and
scattered grains of oats at last feeling
well satisfied she headed her aged body
down the trail toward the second-growth
willows the farther toward the lower end
of the island she got the more tender were
the willow shoots finally she found a
frozen-over swamp where the bulrushes were
so tall that they stood two feet above the
ice by breaking the crust with her feet
and pawing a little she was able to reach the
frozen rushes

early in the spring alex che-
ney came north with a newwagon-
train loaded with freight for tim-
ber city he had used his last
cartridge to shoot a huge snow-shoe rabbit
that had lasted him until he struck an in-
dian village on the banks of the snake
here he had obtained food enough to get
him to fort hall there the soldiers had
grub-staked him and he reached salt lake
the thirtieth day of december-in time to
save his business

  i left ole lisbeth on an island some-
where off here to the right he told his
wagon boss as they came back ive a
notion to go over an see where she died
if the wolves aint eat her ill bury her if
ever a mule deserved a decent burial lis-
beth does

  the wagon boss laughed but alex was
determined and while the train stopped for
dinner the two of them rode over to the
island they found it no hard matter to


adventure

cross to the island and after a little difficulty
alex discovered his saddle

  look here he ejaculated suddenly
somebodys had a fire right here an
theres oats scattered around i never

built a fire an i know-well i never

had no oats

  more than ever interested the men began
to look around cheney rightfully guessed
that it was the outlaws who had camped
there and he wondered what they had done
to lisbeth-if anything presently the
wagon boss let out a yell and hurrying over
alex found him contemplating the skele-
tons of three dead wolves there were
other signs there yet that could not be mis-
taken

  by- if ole lisbeth didnt kill them

wolves im a liar alex marveled

  and presently a new thought began to
occupy his mind it was unreasonable in
the extreme to think that the old mule
had survived even a strong young mule
would have perished early in the winter but

lisbeth-was lisbeth

  - me if i dont take time to look

around till i find out whats become
her he asserted firmly

  hey look exclaimed the wagon boss
whats that cornin

  it was lisbeth her curiosity aroused by
the sound of voices she was gaunt and
scrawny her hip bones projected dis-
mally but on she stepped forward briskly
as she recognized alex there were tears
in cheneys eyes as he threw his arms about
the old mules neck

  i wouldnt a thought she could a made
it-at her age gaped the wagon boss

  look there said cheney sternly but
with a kindly tear-dimmed twinkle in his
eye he turned lisbeth so that her righl
side was toward them on its white side
face dim but still readable was this legend
in black tar

im old but im awfull
tough



or the love of pete dont say
bill adams says unless you
prefix it with that -- fool
bill adams says or words to
that effect what i mean to express is the
fact that what i may happen to say is not
of any consequence i loathe people who
have that infernal habit of laying down the
law i detest the self-sufficient folk who
are so eternally cock-sure of themselves and
so keen and ready to tell the rest of us just
how to live to think and in general how to
conduct ourselves to make the old world
better

  i think it is a pretty good old world for
all of its sin and sorrow and it is my own
belief that if there be above us all a father
he is a quiet minded overseer who has
less patience with the serene and self-satis-
fied than with those of his children who are
forever falling and yet still in their-hearts
willing to climb to the difficult heights

  i	ought not to say i hate- yet i am
inclined to hate all preaching and all
preachers

think that there are men who
are dead to beauty for a time i
have been there myself ive
staggered home at midnight and
before dawn from the orchards sick from
hydro-cyanic-acid gas night after night with
nothing to look forward to but the same
thing tomorrow night after a day of tossing
on a sweat-wet bed in july heat ive worked
till i was far too tired to care whether the
sun set in gold or behind a blackness one
can get so weary that one shuts ones whole
soul up and is merely an animal all one
longs for is sleep and rest-one gets to think
of food of sleep of a day off and beyond
that of nothing

  i dont think that evil or vice of any sort
ever quite kill the love of lovely things in the
mind of man men will always exclaim at a
great beauty no matter how low they have
sunken

  the thing that kills the knowledge of
beauty in our souls is not the worlds com-
mon evil but the inhumanity of man to
his brother man

author of the bush lopers the homesteaders etc

the first part of the story briefly retold in story form

prank ellis woke up one bright morning in
california gulch to find himself a total failure
through the winter of  he had trailed from one
holding to another until the gold mining season was
at a close he was penniless and he had a sister
back east who believed him a great success there
was nothing left for him to do but take a job over
the lunch counter of the great western hotel
under the hand of george skillings boss

  as he was serving his first meal to a group of
miners traders and mine employees he uncon-
sciously burst into a plaintive song

  stop that-racket the boss roared

   from that time on he was the singing pilgrim

  the pilgrim became a drawing card nate goss
the gambler rabbit the indian doomed to death
by his tribe on a charge of killing a brother tribes-
man ancient days an old-time placer miner
bones a man with a delusion of great prehistoric
beasts in the gulches-all fell into the lure of the
pilgrims voice

   whip king reputed to be the best wagon train
boss between the river and the coast arrived in the
gulch with a startling crack of his monstrous whip
he had no special destination no special enemies
and he cared little for firearms but he proved to
be the friend of many restless men who fought
constantly many was the time that his long lash
sent men armed with six-shooters cowering in the
corner

  with the season almost ended and too many men
finding almost no gold things in california gulch
 became a bit thick goss had a fight with charlie
dodge the monte gambler as a result of unfair
play and finally the pilgrim fought with his boss
the fight itself was inconsequential but a threat
loomed in the background when the pilgrim swore
vengeance

  that night skillings the boss was found with a
knife in his heart and the singing pilgrim was
missing from california gulch

examination of skillings effects brought to
light counterfeit money amounting to twenty
thousand dollars the mob almost in a frenzy

shouted-

  hang the pilgrim hang the singing pilgrim

  and added to this they accused goss of being
implicated in the counterfeiting gang giving him a
chance of leaving town immediately or risking the
circumstances if he stayed he left

  with the aid of rabbit the pilgrim stole away
in the night an innocent outcast for many days
they wandered until the pilgrim lost the rabbit
when pursued by the utes the tribe of indians to
which the rabbit belonged certain death threat-
ened the pilgrim he was saved miraculously by
the reappearance of rabbit whom the tribe wor-
shipped as a god calling him the walking dead
man

  an outcast by the name of lomsom who had
affiliated himself with the tribe also came into the
camp trouble began anew by mistake the pil-
grim and lomsom went into the sacred medicine
tent to smoke a pipe of tobacco out of the rain
the indians found them there and in his excitement
the pilgrim put a small idol in his pocketwhich he
had in his hand at the time of the indians en-
trance

  the discovery of the loss of the idol put the camp
in a turmoil the pilgrim was again accused and
threatened with death court was held and rabbit
promised that the idol would be restored with the
release of the pilgrim he was unsuccessful and
only through greath stealth and cunning did the
pilgrim finally escape from the camp of his enemies

adventure

llis sat up and stared help-
lessly

  my names potts did you
steal that hoss quietly asked
the fat man

  speaking rapidly ellis explained his cap-
ture by the utes and how he had ridden the
horse in escaping from the camp potts
heard him through then shook his head and
sighed

  too bad you was awake and heard
our talk i knew when you woke up you
had time to think up a decent lie and you
had to tell that fool story injuns bah
my speaking of injuns put that notion into
your head

  you can hang me but i cant change my
story its true

  hang you of course well hang you
got to do it after hearing that yarn mum-
bled potts his hand resting on the butt of
a revolver thrust through the waist-band of
his rough trousers no getting around
that but so long as youre asleep im
going out and take a look at the weather
the boys will be here soon but do you
know what id do if i was a hossthief and
bound down the valley

  id take that batch of bread and a
couple blankets and travel afoot about seven
miles below cache creek and across the log
bridge to the east side and make over the
spur some eight or twelve hundred feet
high and get down into south park the
trail splits about five miles from the salt
works i think id go to the salt works
instead of south to canon city then
twenty miles north to fair play where id
be within three days of denver where all

-couldnt locate me yes i think id

do that and im sure if i was as young a
hossthief as you id quit that kind of work
and earn an honest living

  with this amazing speech he rose and
waddled from the room turning sideways to
scrape through the doorway ellis recov-
ered his wits and snatched up the saleratus
bread and two blankets and darted from
the hut beyond knowing he was traveling
down the valley and that he was fearfully
afraid of meeting some of the boys he never
had any clear recollection of his flight he
remembered seeing a light which must have
been at tabors old diggings-granite city
-and that below this point the valley was
suddenly compressed until there was
scarcely room for river and road

  it was black in the canon and he was
blundering around rocky hills feeling his
way down down until he expected to walk
into the river then again mounting steep
slopes finally the wide spread of stars
told him the valley had broadened and he
began to realize that the round-faced man
who believed him to be a thief not only had
permitted him to escape but had misled the
posse for there was no sound of pursuit
he floundered into an area of fallen pines
and fearing to wandering farther in the
night he rolled in his blankets and waited
for light

  he slept poorly the fear of pursuit arous-
ing him frequently from bad dreams he
rose before daybreak and discovered his bed
had been at the foot of a high wall of gray
rock every muscle ached and he was
sorely tempted to build a fire but was re-
strained by fear of the fat mans contempt
were he captured again rolling his blankets
he crouched low in the brush and ate some
of his poor bread the sun was just rising
when he resumed his journey he had ad-
vanced but a short distance before he came
to a creek running waist-high without
any hesitation he held his blankets on top
of his head and plunged in

  the valley was open and no longer rough
and broken he had an excellent view of
the sawatch range one peak of which was
painful to gaze at as its coat of snow re-
flected the early sun he tried to walk
some warmth into his lower limbs but suc-
ceeded poorly on beholding a long log
house he turned from the road and reck-
less of consequences boldly approached it
near the house was a patch of wheat a
ditch for irrigating had been started from
the river all this surprised him a man
came out and greeted him

  bon jour msieu you come from de
mine you come on de foot

  ellis replied he was from the diggings at
frying pan gulch at the foot of mount
massive was destitute and compelled to
travel afoot and could he enter and dry
his clothes

  by gar you wet lak de beaver i
mus work every ting inside help
yourself to you eat de meat in de kettle

you eat your - head off joe white

feed a tousand men dis summer almos

  and with a flourishing bow the lone
rancher hurried away to his wheat field and
left ellis in possession
pards



  not only meat was awaiting him but

  so half a pot of strong coffee when
ellis had eaten and drank and dried his
clothes he felt like a new man but he felt
ashamed when he observed how he had
lowered the kettle and had exhausted the
coffee he stepped to the door but could
see no signs of his kind host as a slight
appreciation he left a dollar on the table
before taking to the road

  clouds were gathering over the sawatch
range reinvigorated ellis traveled rap-
idly the valley was nearly level cut only
by shallow gullies on his left was the
spur that separated the arkansas from the
heads of the south platte this was the
barrier he must cross it was a low range
and sparsely timbered and yet repelling be-
cause of the slopes of bare and broken rock

  two miles of brisk walking brought him
to a stout bridge of logs the arkansas at
this point was the width of a maine river
near its head the current however was
swift and foaming and he rejoiced he was
not compelled to ford it

  once on the east side of the river he
sensed an unwarranted security as if the
bridge were an insurmountable barrier to
all pursuit the road also was more pleas-
ing at least for the next two miles for it
passed through grassy meadows and along
scattered groves foliage was painted for
the last mad dance with the fierce winds

  the clouds over the western range re-
frained from advancing somehow ellis
felt an uplift of spirit but he glanced around
guiltily on discovering he was humming a
song goss had warned at their parting
that if he were ever identified as the man
wanted in california gulch it would be by
his singing voice and not by name

  the way left the gracious meadows be-
hind and gradually mounted the slopes
from bench to bench he plodded along and
then found the trail abruptly entering what
proved to be a narrow winding gulch to
the southeast was the beginning of the
great canon of the arkansas with the
first turn in the gulch road the valley van-
ished as if some mountain god had drawn a
curtain behind the traveler

  and as abruptly the scenery changed
a land of gnomes replaced the pleasing
meadows and groves on each side were
enormous pyramids the hills were masses
of dark red boulders many of these were
grotesquely arranged as if cyclopean chil-

dren had played at building castles and had
commenced innumerable gigantic struc-
tures and tiring of the game had finished
none blocks of red stone twenty or forty
feet thick were balanced on fantastic piles
of similar blocks

  some of the tremendous architecture
suggested a budding military genius for
ellis frequently saw what looked to be
forts with mountains for bastions and ranges
for broken ramparts wherever the lonely
traveler directed his gaze there was the
same gigantic eccentric arrangement of
monstrous ruins

  occasional clumps of small pines were all
that varied this chaos until the cactus began
to appear the whole effect on ellis was
that of savagery he began to be afraid
of nature as he plodded along mile after
mile he stared furtively behind him and
to each side as if fearing to behold the an-
cient triceratops the last of the dinosaurs
stalking him from behind some of the weird
formations

  after entering the hills he traveled eight
miles without discovering any suggestion of
a dividing range he no longer feared pur-
suit by mortals california gulch and the
menace he had fled from were as remote as
the moon but he did fear he might die of
exposure and starvation in this desolate
unreal land he sank deeper in despair as
he came to yet another ridge higher than
any he had mounted

  he plunged through the thin timber at
its base and climbed the slope he ex-
pected to behold another barrier once he
gained the naked crest nearly exhausted
by his efforts he halted on the bare top and
muttered aloud in relief on seeing that the
road sloped downward as far as the eye
could reach

  then he ventured to look back and for
several minutes was held motionless by the
wonderful panorama stretched below him
in the immediate foreground were tops of
hills and the innumerable turrets and pyra-
mids he had conquered defects in archi-
tecture were erased the illusion was perfect
and beyond and below these was the world
of men all that the first bend in the gulch
had snatched from his view was now re-
stored softened and beautified the val-
ley of the arkansas several miles in width
appeared to be as smooth as a floor there
were no shallow gullies no raw earth dis-
cords the stretches of sage plains were a


adventure

silver mist and appeared to be translucent
-the course of the river and its tributaries
were cleanly pricked out by the fairy fringe
of timber and from the divide the timber
was wonderfully sky-blue in color for the
background there was the sawatch range
hooded with clouds of ebony except where
one snowy peak thrust its head into the
glorious sunlight

  stretching down toward south park was a
long and beautiful valley he hastened
down to this believing the worst of his
journey was behind him on crossing it he
came to a low ridge which had not shown
from the divide once he mounted this he
knew he was at last entering south park

  now he dared to halt and build a fire and
eat the last of his poor bread and slice of
meat he had brought from the frenchmans
place it was late afternoon when he
paused before he realized it the sun was
gone and darkness was blurring the road
he dragged himself to his feet and limped
on he came to where the road split one
fork leading to the salt works five miles
away the other to canon city without
the sun he did not discover the branching
of the road and having lost all sense of direc-
tion he traveled down the right hand path
the round-faced man had said five miles
of walking would take him to the salt
works he held on for two hours before he
suspected he had lost his way when he
finally halted it was before the mouth of a
lonely gulch discouraged and faint from
exhaustion he set about making a fire of
deadwood determined to camp on the road
until someone came along to tell him where
he was

he soon had a blaze crackling
but had barely seated himself on
his blankets than he was alarmed
by a stone rattling down the
wall of the gulch he jumped to his feet
fearing a bear was coming to investigate
a deep voice demanded-

  whos that down there

  much relieved to hear a human voice
ellis loudly replied-

  a miner from up the arkansas valley
bound for the salt wtorks

  discordant laughter greeted this re-
sponse and the stones rolled and rattled
more rapidly as the unseen descended to the
road

  youre walking right away from the

salt works must have taken the wrong
turn informed the man as he came into
the light of the fire

  ellis decided the stranger would be a fit
denizen of the upland country among the
red pyramids and castles for he stood
more than six feet in height and would
weigh considerably over two hundred but
it was his countenance rather than his bulk

that suggested wildness and savagery the
forehead was low and the eyes small and
deep-set a thick black beard covered
most of the face and reached nearly to the
waist ellis felt repelled by the mans
appearance

  come along to my hut invited the
man in a hoarse voice likely to have a
big rain before morning

  but where am i whats this spot
called asked ellis

  youre on the road to canon city five
miles from where you took the wrong turn
the little gulch making off the road aint
got any regular name side i come down
from is called warders hill im the
warder

  and he indulged in more of his uncom-
fortable laughter then he continued

  im jonathan leaper my cabins up
the gulch a ways im kept busy rescuing
fool miners who lose themselves if you
want rest and food come along not an-
other cabin in twenty miles except at the
salt works and thats ten miles from here
i cant walk another mile groaned
ellis

  dont have to welcome to my cabin
thanks ill be glad to take shelter
with you i can pay for my keep said
ellis

  you fellers who strike it rich can pay for
anything you hanker for boomed the
deep voice

  but i havent struck it rich hastily
pards

ioi

assured ellis but im not flat busted

  of course not rumbled leaper fol-
low me

  as he led the way up the gulch he broke
into wilder laughter several times for
half a mile they followed the narrow twisting
way ellis limped wearily and more than
once stumbled over the rocks for the high
walls shut out the starlight leaper moved
confidently and showed great familiarity
with the rough way occasionally he
would warn boulder here or im turn-
ing to the left at last a bend in
the path brought them in sight of a
light

  leaper came to a halt and in a deep bass
growled

  some ones making mighty free with
my place stay here till i have a look

  although a very large man he moved
with the stealth of a cat in gaining the small
window ellis sat down and began to feel
drowsy he would have gone to sleep had
not leaper returned and aroused him say-
ing

  get up i know the feller for a
mighty good reason youll let on youre a
busted miner and aint got two bits to your
name rough folks in these parts

  as he spoke he slipped a hand under
ellis elbow and helped him along to the low
door and kicked it open

  ellis blinked his eyes in the light thrown
off from the fireplace and became wide
awake on beholding bill waggle standing
in a corner a six-shooter half raised
waggle recognized leaper at once and put
up his gun and with a broad grin be-
gan

  knew it must be you jonathan but

wasnt taking no chances what the-

the singing pilgrim or im a liar

  leaper darted suspicious glances at the
two and commanded

  shut up bill folksll hear you down in
canon city sonny you lay down in the
corner till i git something to eat of course
this mans a pilgrim bill and hes un-
fortunate and is traveling alone and
afoot

  waggle laughed without making any
sound and informed

  but hes lucky to be alive used to sing
for his victuals in california gulch tried
to rob skillings and killed him joke was
he didnt find anything to steal but counter-
feit money theyre looking for this feller

  leaper slowly combed his fingers through
a tangle in his beard and inquired-

  any reward

waggle shook his head and reminded
skillings want liked well enough for
that the gulch wants him sos it can
stretch his neck for passing counterfeit
money

  i didnt kill skillings i know nothing
about any counterfeit money hotly cried
ellis

  of course you didnt rumbled leaper
and you wouldnt be given up to be
stretched if there was ten thousand dollars
on your head

  waggle laughed noiselessly and in-
quired- wheres that skunk of a
goss

  he isnt a skunk hes my friend
defended ellis in a faint voice as he col-
lapsed on the blankets in the corner
dont call names to me that you never
would dare speak to him he ran your
friend charley dodge out of the gulch
waggle showed his teeth in a snarl and
warned

  dont you talk uppity to me you young
pup that cold-deck gambler cant run
me out of a camp where is he

  dont know you ran like a deer after
he gave dodge his needings

  by - i dont take that talk from

nobody on earth shouted waggle reach-
ing for his gun

  leaper exploded in one of his terrible
laughing spells and snatched up an ax and
lowered at waggle the latter hesitated
for a second then folded his arms and as-
sured 

  i aint mussing up your cabin jonathan
but this youngster wants to keep a civil
tongue in his teeth

  dont talk to him roared leaper
you know its bad to git me started

  and he toyed with the ax suggestively
then he told ellis

  you take a nap singing pilgrim or
whatever your name is ill wake you
when grubs ready

  believing leaper had cowed waggle and
with sleep resting an iron hand on his head
ellis sank back on the blankets and closed
his eyes once he roused for a moment or
long enough to hear leapers rumbling
voice warn

  let be you cant play any game here
and youd better be going


adventure

when next he opened his eyes
it was dark outside and leaper
was kindling a fire as the flames
flared ellis gazed about the low
room and for a moment believed the
meeting with waggle was a dream leaper
heard him move and swiftly turned his
huge head and informed

  waggles gone turned him out hes
too peppery ill have coffee ready soon
and the beans warmed up go back to sleep
if you want to its two hours to sunrise
i feel mighty lame and sore but not
sleepy said ellis crawling from the
blankets and sitting on a stool wish i
could buy a horse a cheap one got one
youd sell

  the sunken eyes flickered with little
white lights

  i havent any hoss

  ellis was disappointed

  i can foot it i suppose no supposing
about it i must foot it

  i havent a hoss leaper repeated
but ive got a mule onery critter but
so much stocks being stolen by white
thieves and injuns i dont dast keep any-
thing on four legs except the mule

  if he can carry me to denver by the
way of the salt works and fair play ill
give you fifty for him that would leave
me something for grub in denver until i
can get work

  leapers wild laughter would have
alarmed ellis if not for the accompanying
assurance

  youll need all your money and ill need
the mule but ill lend you the mule as far
as the salt works leave him there for me
to call for youll be rested by that time
and can foot it the rest of the way or catch
a ride down to denver wagons going
down pretty thick so waggle thinks you
killed skillings eh

  i dont know what he thinks hes a
scoundrel i never harmed skillings i
was asleep in nate goss cabin when it hap-
pened an indian hunter woke me up and
told me i must run for it he took me
away ive been sorry ever since i went
with him goss said it was the worst
thing i could have done

  i aint staying awake nights loving bill
waggle or his brother said leaper as
for skillings his cashing in aint no loss
id only think better of you if i knew you
did for him

  i had no more to do with his death than
you did insisted ellis

  was you yarning when you said goss
run dodge out of camp curiously asked
leaper

  if dodge hadnt been wearing a stove
cover over his heart hed died in his tracks

  leaper offered to make no more conversa-
tion he busied himself with the break-
fast and by the time the coffee and beans
were ready the rocky gulch outside began to
reveal itself ellis talked as they ate but
the warder of warders hill did not appear
to hear him when they finished the meal
the tops of the gulch walls were touched
by the first sunlight ellis reminded his
silent host that he was anxious to be going

  without a word leaper opened the door
and led the way to a natural corral formed
by a recess in the rocks in this was the mule
the fallen trunk of a pine blocked the open-
ing pulling the tree aside leaper entered
and from a niche in the rocks pulled out the
wreck of a saddle and fastened it to the
scrawny animal then he turned and
motioned for ellis to join him and mount

  ellis entered the enclosure and remarked

  youre too kind mr leaper at least
let me pay for the grub and the use of the
mule and youve forgotten the bridle

  this critters trained hoarsely mut-
tered leaper youll drive him without
a bridle

  i dont understand how exclaimed
ellis

  leaper darted forward a huge hand and
clutched ellis by the throat and held a re-
volver at his head and roared

  you young dog pay youre mighty
high youre not the first fool to pay toll
to the warder of warders hill put your
hands up

  stupefied ellis obeyed leaper released
his hold on the throat and rapidly searched
him he found no weapons but when he
fished out the money he went into an ec-
stasy of savage mirth

  - what a joke on bill waggle he

yelled

  he deftly yanked ellis hands behind him
and made them fast then he lifted his
victim into the saddle and passed a rope
from ankle to ankle under the mule so he
could not fall nor roll off

  what are you going to do with me
whispered ellis

  nothing cried leaper im lending
pards



you a mule youre leaving your money to
warrantee return of the critter aint i
ind

  he burst into mighty cachinations sud-
denly he ceased his ferocious laughing and
tore a limb from the fallen tree and savagely
struck ellis several times over the head and
shoulders the mule jumped and kicked
driving the animal from the corral leaper
headed him up the gulch and belabored him
with the bough and sent him galloping
madly among and over the rocks

chapter vi

different dangers

up the gulch raced the mule ellis
yelled in fear the first bend took
mount and rider out of sight of leaper and
the cabin the mule suddenly forgot the
blows and turned abruptly at right angles
and clambered like a mountain sheep up
the rough slope to a little shelf of grass
and fell to grazing only the thong tied to
his ankles kept ellis from leaving the saddle
when the mule shifted his course as it
was he lurched far to one side and felt as if
he was broken in two at the waist only
by the greatest effort did he regain an
upright position

  absolutely helpless ellis surrendered to
fate and dully waited for the mule to cease
grazing and kill him by toppling over some
declivity or by dragging him to death after
causing the saddle to slip and roll when
the mule lifted his head and pricked his long
ears and looked at the rocks above the grass-
plot ellis believed leaper had followed to
finish him he beheld a battered hat
slowly rising above a boulder then a face a
face wearing a scrubby beard

  thank god weakly cried ellis scarcely
daring to believe his eyes hi come
here and cut me loose

  the stranger placed a finger to his lips
and studied the rough course of the gulch
for a few moments then he emerged from
behind the boulder and scrambled down to
the shelf he had a ragged blanket and a
battered coffee-pot strapped on his back
and his boots were broken exposing his toes
he was a thoroughly disreputable appear-
ing man one of the many derelicts ever
drifting about the camps

  but he was beautiful to ellis the mule
however did not fancy the newcomer or

else feared a return to the rocky corral
with a flirt of his heels he plunged headlong
down the slope nearly breaking the riders
back the ragged man followed the
mule headed up the gulch and slowed to a
walk and jerked his head from side to side
in search for another grazing ground the
stranger clumped after him gradually
gaining ground when almost within
reach the mule discovered him and was off
at a bouncing gallop

  the man pulled a revolver from his boot
and still walking followed satisfied with
his lead the mule walked sedately ellis
looked back despairingly and feared the
stranger would tire of his helpful purpose
beholding the revolver ellis begged-

  shoot ill risk anything

  the man waved his hand and from under
his ragged coat produced a small coil of rope
and made a noose in one end then he
swung off to one side and climbed above the
floor of the gulch and pressed on sometimes
in sight and often hid by boulders when
abreast of the mule he disappeared the
mule continued at a walk for a few rods
then broke into a trot and headed for a
patch of grass there was no sign of the
stranger and ellis decided he had given up
the chase the mule halted and grazed
greedily

  a shrill whistle caused ellis to start ner-
vously and brought the mules head up
with a jerk and from a near-by rock shot the
noosed rope and encircled the brutes neck
madly excited and wildly exultant ellis
sounded a sharp yell but the battle was
not won the mule jumped and backed
violently crushing ellis legs against boul-
ders and all but killing him before the in-
sistence of the noose won the fight when
the mule fell to his knees ellis slumped for-
ward on his neck like a bag of meal nor
could he straighten up

  the man closed in by shortening the
rope and ellis glimpsed a knife in his left
hand the mule made a final effort and
went back on his knees

  slide off commanded the stranger
your feet are free

  ellis feet and legs were numb and he had
not known when the thong was severed
he threw himself to one side and rolled to
the ground the man kept the rope taut
and ordered him to get clear of the mad-
dened brute with no sense of feeling in
his legs and with his hands tied at his back


adventure

ellis could only accomplish this maneuver
by rolling

  the man loosened the noose a bit and
allowed the mule to stagger to his feet
near by was a pinon and the stranger led
the half-choked animal to this and fastened
the rope to a bushy branch then he ran
to ellis and released his hands

  you were in a bad fix pardner he
commented

  i was in - feebly answered ellis

sitting up and rubbing his benumbed legs
and ankles i was going crazy with the
thought of the death i must die if you
hadnt happened along-

  it was too horrible to finish

  the man laughed softly and corrected

  i didnt happen i came on purpose
youre the second man jonathan leaper
has given a ride within two weeks its his
love of cruelty that will undo him usu-
ally a man enters this gulch and is never
seen or heard of again but ive got the
other feller ready to give evidence and you
make the second witness now ill put
him where he belongs whats your
name

  frank ellis got lost met him on
the canon city road stayed at his cabin
over night this morning he robbed me of
my money and roped me to that beast

  it couldnt have happened better my
names farnham live at buckskin united
states marshal leapers been playing his
games for two seasons he never troubles
any one going up to the mines gives them
food and shelter but he catches them
coming back when they come alone if it

hadnt been for his-s liking to torture

a victim by tieing him to a mule he might
never have been suspected

  few people notice when a man disap-
pears out here coming and going all the
time no house within twenty miles of this
gulch except the one at the salt works
men are strangers to each other and no
ones concerned over what happens to a
stranger

  but about two weeks ago leaper played
the mule trick on a man who had a thousand
in nuggets and was riding a fine mule
turned him loose on the mule it was two
days before the fellow was rescued man
chopping wood quite a few miles from here
happened along and he had to risk killing
the rider by shooting the mule through the
head then i got into the game the

mans evidence explained several disap-
pearances last season and this

  im awfully obliged what will we do
next asked ellis his anger flaring up as he
thought of his money

  keep low tiil tonight then sneak down
to the cabin if hes alone ill get him
there was a man there part of last
night informed ellis bill waggle
you know waggle curiously asked
farnham

  only by sight

  just where were you hailing from when
you met leaper

  frying pan gulch lied ellis

  heard about a killing up in california
gulch i suppose

  heard about several some one is shoot-
ing or knifing some one else up there right
along i guess replied ellis

  he began to feel nervous under the ex-
amination

  i referred to a hotel keeper man
named skillings

  i dont remember that name

  well my first job is to nail leaper and
take him to denver well keep the mule
tied up here and wait till dark and we
must watch to see if leaper is curious how
your ride came out and wanders up this
way

  ellis felt much relieved to have the ques-
tions cease he was sorry he had volun-
teered any information about waggle he
dreaded the possibility of an interview be-
tween leaper and the marshal for waggle
had told the former about skillings death
and the camps suspicion as to the slayer
he began to believe he had escaped imme-
diate death only to be faced by a murder
charge in a denver court

  farnham shifted the position of the mule
so he could graze in a patch of thin grass
and led the way up among the rocks where
they could discover leaper should he ven-
ture up the gulch

  time passed slowly ellis reclined on his
back and watched the blue sky and specu-
lated on his fate he heartily wished he
had risked remaining at twin lakes until
goss was able to travel

  farnham was intent on studying the
guich floor and the sloping walls finally
he began to talk and he told ellis some-
thing of the criminal trail that extended
from new mexico to denver and the moun-
tain camps he declared his belief that
pards



leapers cabin was one of the wayside sta-
tions for horsethieves stage robbers coun-
terfeiters and other lawless men

  he also was convinced that leaper was
half mad and worked entirely alone in rob-
bing wayfarers afraid that this recital
would terminate in more questions such as
how he came to know waggle and the like
ellis pretended to be sleepy and from pre-
tending soon fell asleep in earnest

it was dusk when farnham
aroused him and said

ive eaten heres bread and
meat i fetched along with me
get at it and well be going time to make
our call

  ellis made short work of the food and
limped painfully after his rescuer down the
slope they left the mule so as not to
arouse leapers attention or excite his sus-
picions ellis was surprised to find how
short a distance the mule had brought him
from the cabin he had believed that the
involuntary ride had covered several miles
on beholding the light he exclaimed-
surely that cant be the cabin

  surely cant be any other unless ones
been built since sunup assured farnham
now this is the way well work it leaper
must be caught off his guard i dont in-
tend to be killed or even broken up by him
im a bummer im no good ill go to
the cabin and beg for food and a place to
sleep im nearly starved im not worth
robbing once inside i must wait for a
chance to get the drop on leaper may
have to kill him in his tracks

  ellis hoped the affair might end thus
hes strong as a grizzly and half crazy
if he puts up a fight ill nail him what i
want to do is to take him alive and carry
him to denver you keep outside till i
whistle then come on the jump pick up a
club from the firewood by the door and be
ready to belt him over the head

  what if theres some one with him one
of the gang you were telling about ner-
vously whispered ellis

  then i must remain a camp rat stay if
hell let me or be kicked out cheerfully
amended farnham still i should know
ahead if any ones with him while im
making for the door you sneak to the win-
dow and see if hes alone if he isnt youd
better go up the gulch and spend the night
with the mule

  ellis slowly advanced to a position op-
posite the small window leaper was
squatting before the fire intent on counting
a roll of money something aroused his
suspicions possibly the tensity of ellis
gaze he lifted his head and glared about
like a wild animal scenting the hunter
then he came to his feet and pulled aside a
wolf skin on the wall and thrust the money
in a niche between the logs and centered his
gaze on the door ellis cautiously with-
drew and gained farnhams side and whis-
pered 

  alone but on his guard must have
heard some sound

  havent moved a muscle back to the
window come in when the trouble starts

i may be too busy to whistle quickly
directed farnham

  then he commenced a stumbling advance
toward the door and called out-

  hi there in the house

  almost before he finished calling out the
door opened and leaper stood on the thresh-
old his head thrust forward to escape con-
tact with the lintel log

  whos that barking who be you
harshly demanded leaper as the ragged
figure limped into the light streaming
through the doorway

  starving man out of luck give me a
hunk of bread gasped farnham and he
walked unsteadily

  get away from here you-beggar

or ill kill you roared leaper

  good lord just a bite to keep my in-
nards quiet till i can make a settlement
pleaded farnham i aint eaten for so
long i really believe ill die here before your
door in this gulch if i dont have food
anything a dry crust you wouldnt give
a dog just a few mouthfuls

  perhaps leaper did not relish the idea of
a penniless wanderer dying near his cabin
for him to bury for conceal such an un-
fortunate he must or have the name with-
out the game he clawed his fingers
through his tangled beard for a few mo-
ments then growled and stepped back and
motioned farnham to enter

  what id give a dog eh he rumbled
youre a dog swaller that and get clear
of this gulch or ill cut your throat

  he picked up a slab of coarse bread and
broke it in two and tossed half of it to farn-
ham who was now standing beside the
door farnham grabbed for it eagerly and
io

adventure

awkwardly and it fell to the floor he bent
forward and picked it up with his left hand
and at the same time pulled the heavy re-
volver from his boot with his right hand
then he was erect and hurling the bread
into leapers face and was felling him to the
floor with a blow from the heavy barrel
it was all finished in two seconds

  ellis holding his breath stared in amaze-
ment through the window as the warder of
warders hill was thus summarily disposed
of he had considered leaper to be little
less than a demon there he was on the
floor blood trickling from the wound on his
shaggy head and farnham whipping hand-
cuffs from the second boot leg and snapping
them on the brutes wrists

  the marshal brought ellis out of his
stupor by glancing toward the window and
announcing

  all over he was an easy nut to crack
come in

  leaper was not seriously hurt for the
marshals words were barely uttered before
he roared mightily and started to get on his
feet the revolver barrel landed on his
head and sent him back when ellis en-
tered the room the fallen giant was beating
his head on the floor and tearing his mana-
cled hands through his long beard

  farnham stared down at him and en-
couraged 

  abuse yourself all you want to no one
here to stop you

  leaper ceased his violence and glared at
the marshal in silence on beholding ellis
some of his cunning returned and all of his
hate he slowly rose to his feet farnham
watching him closely he raised his hands
and sprang to bring them down on ellis
head the marshal thrust forward a foot
and tripped him headlong then the marshal
snatched a piece of rope from a peg and
deftly looped it around the prisoners
ankles

  youve had enough exercise he said

  ellis was afraid of the man despite the
ease with which farnham had mastered
him leaper glared at him malevolently
and began his wild laughing ellis feared
the man would remember waggles talk
about skillings death and repeat it to the
marshal the latter prevented any imme-
diate recital by saying

  im going to fetch the mule watch
this man sharp if he tries any game belt
him over the heaj with a stool

  he disappeared into the darkness and
leaper recovered his self-control enough to
realize he was not furthering hisown cause
who is that man he asked of ellis
united states marshal from buckskin
he saved my life after you thought youd
done for me

  pretty company hes in when he comes
here with you does he know you mur-
dered skillings

  no one knows that it isnt a fact
said ellis

  waggle says it is a fact see here if i
go to denver with him youll go along tied
to me and youll swing warned leaper

  ellis did not believe he could face the
prisoners disclosure he stepped to the
hiding place in the logs and removed the
hidden money and counted it it was the
same amount taken from him that morn-
ing let me loose and save yourself
trouble youve got your money urged
leaper

  no farnham saved my life tell him
what you like

  leaper was disappointed he was silent
for a minute then he suggested

  if you dont give evidence against me in
denver ill keep my mouth shut about
skillings want to trade

  farnham had said he already had one of
the mans victims ready to give evidence
ellis believed it would be equivalent to sur-
rendering himself to the law on a charge of
homicide did he appear as a witness against
leaper and thereby be compelled to give
his personal history he slowly replied

  i wont testify against you until you tell
what waggle said if you tell it or if bill
waggle tells it ill testify that you robbed
me and tried to murder me

  a bargain growled leaper nothing
can be done to me till we reach denver i
have friends there ill have word passed
to bill to keep shut about you youll save
your neck and ill have a chance to save
mine

  ive already told farnham you robbed
me ill have to tell him i have it back
informed ellis

  leaper scowled over this then decided
it wont matter if you dont tell it in
court the bargain stands

  he made no effort to release his hands and
apparently was asleep when the marshal
returned ellis produced the money and
explained seeing leaper hide it and asked
pards



farnham to count it the marshal did so
and told him to keep it then he searched
the cabin carefully for other moneys but
found none leaper kept his eyes closed
during all this but farnham noticed his big
face was twisted into a grimace or a smile

   that fellers hurting himself laughing
said farnham lets have grub

  ellis cooked bacon and made coffee and
the prisoner opened his eyes and was
permitted to eat farnham decided they
should stand watch over the man through
the night and elected to be the first it was
two oclock- of a new day when ellis was
aroused he sat wrapped in a blanket until
sunrise

  breakfast was quickly cooked and eaten

 leaper had not spoken a word since farn-
ham returned with the mule the night be-
fore his eyes glittered with hope when
ellis returned from the corral and an-
nounced the mule was gone

  then well walk decided farnham

   im not walking leaper broke his long
silence to inform

  youll walk assured farnham to
ellis cut two stout cudgels this man
walks and walks brisk or hell never walk
again

  leaper stood up and surrendered- 

  im ready

  the sun was warm and genial until they
came to where ellis had made the wrong
turn then clouds swiftly closed the sky and
rain began the wind beat in their faces
and the road grew muddy leaper walked
savagely as if wishing to tire his captors or
have the disagreeable journey over with
ellis found some shelter by keeping close
to his heels

  the storm passed away when they were
within two miles of the salt works ahead
of them rose an isolated mountain and
soon they were cheered by the sight of
smoke rising from its base

  the plain had been dreary enough during
the storm but now it was pleasing in the
sunshine farnham called ellis attention
to what looked like patches of snow and
told him they were salt incrustations but
the singing pilgrim was more interested in
the large cabin and the smoking chimney

  two long wagons were near the cabin and
another was loading salt from a shanty
several teamsters and employees stared
curiously at leaper for handcuffs were sel-
dom seen in the mountains charles hall

new york born but a veteran of the moun-
tains came out of the house and greeted
farnham cordially the marshal explained
his business and asked for a chance to ride
with his prisoner to denver or at least as
far as fair play

  mr hall promptly told him

  youll ride clear through youve
walked enough come inside you two and
have some dinner the prisoner can be
fed afterward in the kitchen one wagon
is starting in a few hours for denver and
will make fair play some time this evening
how about the young man fussy when
he starts

  ill travel anytime when i can get a
lift said ellis

  he wras anxious to separate from farn-
ham before reaching denver

  then youd better start right after you
eat a light-hitch is going only as far as
fair play after farnhams wagon has
left a load there you can ride with him the
rest of the trip

  it was a wonderful dinner they sat down
to and after they had eaten leaper proved
he had not lost his appetite leaper was
still bolting meat and hot bread when a
teamster came to the door and announced
he was ready to start ellis hurriedly
shook hands with mr hall and the marshal
and ran to the wagon farnham called
after him-

  see you soon in fair play 
ellis waved a hand and climbed up beside
the driver he had no intention of becom-
ing acquainted with denver courts and
justice through any prolonged association
with the marshal

colorado was a military dis-
trict and denver was under
martial law with the provost
guard discouraging quarrels be-
tween soldiers and civilians surviving
members of the notorious criterion saloon
gang refrained from flaunting their wicked-
ness and worked by stealth desperate
and reckless men continued to rob and
kill but no longer boasted of their evil in
public

  if carl wood charles harrison and
steele the gambler no longer shot up the
town there was at work a more widely
spread organization operating with a defi-
nite purpose and considerable efficiency

  in place of reckless and open outlawry

adventure

and braggadocio in drinking saloons with
bullet or rope ultimately curing them there
was the loosely knit association of thieves
and bandits that methodically worked for
profit and had for its field the entire colo-
rado territory and a portion of new mexico

  at least half of the citizens in the arkan-
sas valley and a goodly portion of those at
the heads of the platte sympathized with
secession at the outbreak of war many
had returned home to support the south
but enough remained in the mountains and
denver to strike sparks of discord

  until the provost guard was mounted
quarrels between soldiers and civilians were
of frequent occurrence wild rumors of
the knights of the golden circle establish-
ing branches in camps and towns of plans
to seize the gold country and divert its
riches into the treasury of the confederacy
of missouri guerrillas about to collect rich
toll from the private mines and the strong
boxes of merchants and express offices in
denver the lawless element was provided
with an excellent screen to work behind

  war news relayed from the old california
crossing two hundred miles away fre-
quently fanned sectional differences into
violence general butler at new orleans
was execrated by southern men in denver
and was staunchly supported by unionists
mcclellans retirement from the peninsula
and jacksons victory at cedar mountain
caused jubilation and chagrin immedi-
ately on the receipt of war news the provost
guard was on edge to maintain order

  of intimate concern and interest was the
ferocious guerrilla warfare in kansas and
missouri already it had closed the arkan-
sas valley to immigration and stifled the
hopes of southern towns to rival denver

  unless the two border states should be-
come more tranquil travel up the platte
likewise would be blocked neither south-
ern nor northern man cared to be shut off
from eastern supplies of food and machin-
ery yet ever closer was the danger of a
general indian uprising distorted reports
of the sioux massacres in minnesota-and
the truth was evil enough-were being
brought from the crossing by special cou-
riers veteran mountain men were con-
vinced the plains sioux and cheyennes
were on the verge of smoking war tobacco
and that it was only a matter of days before
the kiowas as a nation would commence
hostilities

  in this connection it was prophesied that
the arapahos would join their ancient
friends the cheyennes and that the utes
would seize the opportunity to ravage and
plunder

  the august draft of three hundred thou-
sand nine-months men was continually
taking toll among the able-bodied north-
erners and just as assiduously men were
continually making for texas to later meet
their colorado acquaintances on hostile
fields

  now that placer mining had seen its best
days claim and mine owners were turning
speculators there were no holdings in the
gregory districts that eastern capital could
not purchase miners had become mine
owners there was a general belief that
more money could be made by buying and
selling than by developing the real estate
market was very active brick and lumber
were abundant and the former was perhaps
the cheaper building material

  handsome brick blocks and commodious
frame structures covered the sites of sixty-
ones huts and tents speculators were
endeavoring to boom the highlands on the
bluffs opposite the city but were finding
it rather slow work in the city proper
realty values were constantly increasing
trade markets fluctuated weirdly prices
mounted as transportation became uncer-
tain in fact or fancy and often dropped to
cost when delayed trains arrived close to-
gether and for a time glutted the market
agriculture had not been thoroughly tested
all supplies necessary for farming and
mining came from the east and at times
paid a freight tariff of ten cents a pound

  nathan goss recently arrived on a horse
bought at camerons ranch was quick to
sense the cross currents of purpose as he
walked the busy streets and refreshed him-
self with watching the activities he was
weary of mountain camps this thriving
community on the gradually sloping plain
was a great relief had he felt free to re-
sume his vocation he would have been
thoroughly contented but there was frank
ellis to be found rather an annoying duty

  euclid the young eccentric had gone to
canon city veiled inquiries at the broad-
well house had failed to find any trace of
ellis desire insisted he had done what he
could to locate the young man and that he
could not afford to waste more time yet
ellis was on top of his mind even as he
pards

found pleasure in strolling the streets he
thought of him every time he saw a pilgrim
just arrived out

  he walked aimlessly searching for ellis
in the passing groups trying to appease the
voice of duty and all the while he en-
joyed the absence of that shut-in feeling
for two years he largely had lived in deep
and narrow gulches these streets eighty
feet wide gave him an uplift and caused him
to feel he had escaped from a dreary cap-
tivity yet he felt he must do his utmost
to find the singing pilgrim

  nuisance old enough to look after
himself he muttered as he stood on f
street and glimpsed the waters of the platte
five blocks away where a year before
arapaho lodges and tents of immigrants had
stood beyond the river were the moun-
tains gay with many colors like giants be-
decking themselves with a womans finery

  nor were the indians entirely retired
from the town many had learned to
crave liquor and remained and lived in
sordid slavery for the sake of an occasional
dram he encountered one an arapaho
near the rocky mountain news office try-
ing to tell william byers editor and pub-
lisher that he wanted him to say in his
talking paper that his chief little raven
would pay ten ponies for the return of his
lost buchanan medal distributed in the
fall of i together with lincoln and
douglas medals

  from the broadwell house the gambler
passed the brick church and entered a maze
of stores gaming halls saloons and the
homes of light-o-loves and wandered
widely he was doing his duty by the
singing pilgrim he told himself while he
aimlessly drifted with the crowd or stemmed
the current to inspect a gambling place
in heatly and chases place he was in-
vited to make up a poker outfit but de-
clined

  night would be early enough to resume
his work until then he must satisfy his
eyes with roomy streets he found much
pleasure in loitering up streets that ran
northwest and gazing at longs peak this
view made him feel like a man who has
escaped from prison and who lingers in
open places to look back on the scene of his
detention

  finally he came to a halt in front of the
old pacific house where a crowd was block-
ing the street gathered there by the spec-

tacle of a woman in fluffy skirts walking a
tight-rope across larimer street his in-
terest was as keen as that of a young boy
watching his first circus he gave no heed
when a hand touched his elbow he real-
ized it was not an accidental contact with
the crowd when strong fingers seized his
arm and shook it impatiently turning his
head he stared into the vicious face of bill
waggle

the fingers of his right hand
slipped inside his left cuff as he
remarked-
s so youre still alive bill
and he darted his gaze about and de-
manded-

  wheres dodge

  gone north to new diggings hows it
feel to be run out the gulch

  youre a liar i walked out

  waggle grinned and asked-

  wheres your young hooting friend
with a show of indifference he was far
from feeling goss replied

  dont know he quit the gulch ahead
of me havent seen him since

  i have

  goss face froze disturbed and anxious
to learn where waggle met ellis he in-
differently remarked- that so what
of it

  nothing of it but if you see him just
remind him to remember his bargain and
keep his mouth shut

 what bargain with whom just
what do you mean waggle

  our cats waking up pilgrim will
know what i mean and i aint known as
waggle in this town

  if folks here should know what i know
youll be wearing a rope

 mebbe but you wont give me
away

  i dont talk a lot still i tried to shoot
you in california gulch for sneaking that
gun to dodge but you speak as if making
a threat as if daring me to call out your
name and history i can be bluffed wag-
gle but only by a much better man than
you

  go ahead and shout defied waggle
but if theres a rope for me therell be an-
other for the singing pilgrim and hell
stretch it

  talk talk complained the gambler
wearily what are you coming at
no

adventure

  the news printed a piece about skill-
ings death said the pilgrim skipped out
and is wanted i know things you keep
your yap shut and ill keep mine shut
just tell him to remember his bargain
goss stored at him stonily for a moment
then said

  all right but why think im likely
to meet him

  cause hes here in denver somewhere
ive tried to locate him and tell him to git
out of town i saw you leaving heatlys
place and trailed you till i could find you
in a crowd like this the younker will be
in his last bit of trouble if hes found by cer-
tain folks and goes to blatting if he
keeps his word and clears out my friends
will keep mum

  im no talker repeated goss but
if ever i drop a gun on you again your
troubles will be all over so far as the moun-
tain countrys concerned that woman has
nerve

  and he gazed at the tight-rope walker
now finishing her aerial journey at an open
window

  when he turned his head waggle had dis-
appeared the gambler remained staring
at the window seemingly much interested
in the exhibition inwardly he was much
perturbed by the ruffians talk he had
trained his face and nerves but he never
could train his heart prematurely experi-
enced in concealing his feelings he was none
the less human having acted as ellis pro-
tector he found he was unable to put aside
his sense of responsibility

  young idiot he muttered as he turned
up the street and where did that
skunk see him after he left us at twin
lakes says he knows hes in denver
he couldnt have seen him here or hed
talked to him and wouldnt be sending any
word by me wonder if he really knows
hes here or if he thinks it and was trying to
learn something definite from me

  he went back to the broad well house and
wandered into the bar only by a strong
effort did he maintain his bored bearing
once he saw whip king whip in hand and
with the dust of the trail on his shoulders
leaning against the upper end of the bar
and talking with a number of freighters
whip king called out to him goss ac-
knowledged the greeting with a gesture and
went to the other end of the bar and ordered
a glass of lager after a few minutes whip

king quit the group and came down the bar
and greeted-

  hows tricks

  goss waited until the bartender filled a
second glass and returned to wait on the
freighters then replied

  rather bad the singing pilgrim was
to meet me here just heard hes in den-
ver but i cant locate him

  and he sketched his adventures among
the utes and about ellis starting alone
from twin lakes to make the city

  for the moment whip kings interest was
not on ellis for he exclaimed

  euclid snagged by injuns bet he
talked them crazy now down in canon
city if that dont beat all nature

  im more concerned about the pilgrim
euclid isnt wanted for anything or by
anybody hed drive me crazy in a month
if the pilgrim is here hell be showing up
i went after a man down on the canadian
once and found him oughter be easy to
locate a man in this town my friends up
the line- he nodded toward the freighters
at the end of the bar-was just telling me
that united states marshal farnham has
fetched in a man from below the salt works
jonathan leaper by name believed to
have killed several miners arriving out of
the mines its believed hes one of the

gang thats been raising so much -

tween heren taos for the last two years
they say theres two witnesses against him
thatll spike him into a wooden box sures
some steers are wild got extry guards
sos none of the gang will git him loose
the last sentence interested goss as it
suggested a possible reason for waggles
presence in town he did not mention
waggle to whip king for there was sud-
denly born in his mind the suspicion that
harm would come to ellis if the ruffian were
arrested there was the bargain waggle
intimated ellis had made with some one
goss finally said

  whip king im in trouble i must find
ellis at once if hes here in denver ill
give the town a real combing this time he
was to call here no one by the name of
ellis has shown up

  probably shifted his name

  that may be but hed be as safe under
his own name only two ways he can be
recognized by some one who knew him in
california gulch or by his singing voice
ill try the desk again
pards

hi

  he found the clerk and inquired if any one
had asked for him or for whip king

  not a soul mr goss assured the clerk
and he turned away to wait on a newcomer

  the gambler moodily cut the end of a
cigar and was about to light it when he
heard a most musical voice say

  thank you im rather uncertain how
long i shall stay here

  goss turned as she walked to the stairs
preceded by a boy carrying a beflowered
carpetbag and followed by an employee lug-
ging a small horsehide trunk goss saw
only the womans back but he had heard
her voice from her graceful carriage he
knew she was young and from her voice he
decided she must be beautiful but women
were no novelty in denver back in the
old days two years before every masculine
eye would have followed the slim figure
goss gave her attention simply because
there was a quality in her voice which was
vaguely reminiscent of something it al-
most came to him he moved to the end
of the desk for a last word with the clerk
and said-

  if any one asks for me tell him to leave a
note saying when and where hell meet me
and-

  his tongue became paralyzed as a down-
ward sweep of his gaze fell on the prim signa-
ture-

annie ellis martinsville indiana

  when and where hell meet you
prompted the clerk

yes ill be back soon mumbled goss

  he turned toward the door his dis-
ciplined mind for once in a sad whirl men
entering from the street blocked his way
as he stepped aside and waited he heard a
man say

  its a phase every community of quick
growth seems bound to go through too
much gambling and speculation too much
recklessness and disregard for law and order
the men trying to raise crops out here find
that for the first few years their efforts are
defeated by insect pests in town building
its much the same but after we have
settled down the gambler and thug will be
driven out at least into hiding just as the
grasshoppers and other nuisances will be
overcome by the farmer

  the speaker was governor evans per-
sonal friend of president lincoln and suc-
cessor to william gilpin after the latter

was perhaps too harshly judged for cutting
red tape and sending his pet lambs to defeat
baylors babes and discourage the con-
federacys efforts to secure and control the
gold lands

  goss sidled along to the door and gained
the street with his mind ringing with the
one word phase gambling was well near
universal in the camps and towns goss
had seen a colorado sheriff pawn his re-
volver to continue in a poker game he
had played with law-givers and national
legislators with merchants and miners
he always had prided himself on being a
square card-man

  governor evans evidently considered
gambling an incident something short-
lived goss resented the characterization
it was the one occupation he had qualified
for if gambling ceased to be the general
pastime or if it became something furtive
he would have no vocation the thought
was disturbing even in the midst of his
wonderment and dismay over the ellis girls
arrival he had to meditate on the governors
prophecy and consider if he a gambler was
something very transient

  if gambling is stopped ill be as deep in
cap as the pilgrim he muttered as he
wandered aimlessly to the corner

  then his thoughts switched back to his
friend and the girl and being off his guard
his lean dark face betrayed the concern and
bewilderment promptly returned to lodge in
his mind if ellis did not turn up what
would his sister do and if he did appear
what would she do

  and why the-did she come out here

like this he hopelessly asked himself

  situations calling for direct methods such
as shooting it out with charley dodge were
easily handled but how was one to go to
a lonely young woman and bluntly explain
her brother had disappeared or that he was
practically a fugitive from mountain jus-
tice to remain aloof and permit her to
remain in agonizing ignorance was unthink-
able

         goss halted at g street between
market and blake where many
iac gathered to watch stage
coaches and other passenger vehi-
cles start for the river near-by was jim
beckwourth for years head chief of the
crows but now trying his hand at farming
his long black hair and reckless visage and


adventure

dak complexion made him an outstanding
figure even among those who allowed their
hair to grow and preferred buckskin to
woolen

  contrary to popular belief this pictur-
esque mixed-blood was a mulatto and not
of indian-white descent clinging to his
arm was his mexican wife a tiny creature to
whom with a flourish he was presenting an
old mountain man he addressed her as
madame beckwourth the mountainman
was william mcgaa known to beckwourth
and old-time trappers as jack jones who
was eating his heart out because the street
named after him had been rechristened after
holladay

  madame beckwourth was forgotten as the
two men began reminiscing volubly and
unconsciously duplicating their spoken
speech with the sign language of the plains
indians

  tie their hands and they couldnt talk
murmured whip king over goss shoulder
makes me feel sort of homesick to see so
many outfits pulling out and me left here
ill soon be forgetting how to crack my
whip

  just the man i want to talk with softly
exclaimed goss best of luck weve come
together again

  luck nothing ive been trailing you
ever since you quit the hotel something
happened

  the singing pilgrims sister has arrived
at the broadwell house groaned goss
 somebody must meet her and tell her
something

  good land but that sounds sort of bad
arrived out with no one expecting her
mumbled whip king but your talk
sounds hazy somebody tell her some-
thing who knows whats to be told her
why did she come out here and whos to
tell her and tell her what

  i pass surrendered goss gloomily
not a card in my hand nor an idea in my
head but if a stranger must call on her to
explain youre the man i dont know what
you can say

  no siree ill tackle a grizzly with my
old whip see here nathan you happen
round up there shell be asking ques-
tions you chip in and tell her

  what snarled goss

  well whatever seems to be best

   ellis is the one to talk to his sister con-
tinued goss i believe he is still in town

i know he was here you must help me
find him

  like hunting for a jackknife i once lost
on green river grumbled whip king
but lets be looking ill round up lodging
houses you look in stores he may be
working

  depending largely upon luck the two
separated ellis was not known in denver
and had he been his searchers would not
have risked asking about him by name
whip king had selected the more tedious
part of the hunt the gambler could enter
a store and glance at the employees and be
done with the place the wagon train boss
could only loiter about doorways and ob-
serve the tenants entering and leaving he
could ask no questions after several hours
of this unsatisfactory work whip king
started back to the broadwell house hoping
that goss had been more successful on
the way he met united states marshal
hunt the marshal had just left the jail on
larimer street near e after shaking hands
and exchanging greetings the marshal in-
formed 

  we have a bloody red-handed murderer
in there and theres a chance of his going
free couple of years ago wed hung him
from the cherry creek bridge and gone home
to supper but the court cant convict un-
less theres sufficient evidence when mar-
shal farnham brought him in there was
every prospect of a hanging farnham
worked up the case had two witnesses on
tap who could have settled leapers hash
thats his name jonathan leaper now
were in a fine stew one witness tied to a
mule and turned loose in the mountains by
leaper has died from the shock of his wild
ride united states attorney sam brown
says he cant go to trial without some evi-
dence

  you spoke of two witnesses reminded
whip king ive heard queer yarns about
leaper but nothing you could hang your
hat on worked alone and lived alone no
woman in his life to give him away

  the other witness was a young man
supposed to come in with farnham they
separated at the salt works and were to
meet at fair play young man plumb dis-
appeared that leaves brown high and
dry he has a murderer but no witnesses

  hard luck spose youre hunting for
the missing witness

  we dont even know he ever made
pards



denver said hunt if he did some of
the gang may have made away with him
well look for him but theres too many
young men in denver for me to pick out the
right stranger were going to run a notice
in the news asking him to call at the jail
maybe hell turn up in a few days

  probably agreed whip king what
we need is for some sort of a game like
what young dave cook has in mind wish
hed come back from the service and start
it going

  meaning his rocky mountain detec-
tive association  said hunt well i
dont know the idea is fine but where can
you get the right kind of men to chase law-
breakers men with guts and brains
enough to handle the bad ones out here are
in business or politics itll take capital to
start the association cook himself is smart
enough looks rather dubious

  cooks young not much over twenty
but hell never get that bee out of his bonnet
and big profits wont ever tempt him into
any other line of work hope you find that
other young man

  with this whip king walked on to the
hotel

  goss was standing just inside the main
entrance his gaze fixed on the door be-
fore whip king could speak the gambler
was motioning him to a chair and was whis-
pering 

  i found him didnt know him at first
shaved clean and well dressed working
next to the corner of f and blake in brown
and daniels grocery store he was much
upset by my talk hes hiding to keep from
being called on as a witness in court just
as soon as he finishes his work and when it
gets dark hell come up and see his sister
he wanted me to see her and prepare her for
his coming to tell her about his hard luck
shes out shopping my nerve failed i
wouldnt have goie up if shed been here

  he mustnt come here growled whip
king and he repeated his talk with united
states marshal hunt

  by- leave it to that fellow to get

   	david j cook b indiana  mining in col 
then two years farming in kansas and freighting en-
listed transferred to ordnance dept of frontier  and
organized the rocky mountain detective association in
that year worked much with sheriffs in wyoming
nate k boswell arrested jesse james and lodged him in
laramie city jail james released for lack of evidence
no one knowing his true identity shortly afterward bos-
well saw a picture of james and recognized him as the
released prisoner cooks frontier adventures covered
twenty years and includes battles with the boldest bandits
of the old border

  

into trouble groaned the gambler if he
had a pat hand hed find there were five
aces in it now whats to be done if he
goes into court hell be identified and held
for skillings death thats what bill wag-
gle meant by his roundabout threats and
his hints about a bargain bargain with
this leaper bargain must be that the gang
will keep shut about him being wanted in
california gulch if hell keep off the witness
stand didnt have moren half a minute
to speak with im to go back and pick
him up hes a jonah

  whip king scowled heavily and pursed
his thick lips thoughtfully finally he said
maybe its best for him to go to court
and take the chances shortest way out of it 
he ran away the night the man was
killed hes kept away from farnham since
leaving him the gang will send men in to
swear him into a noose

  you cant get clear of trouble by run-
ning away from it doggedly insisted whip
king sooner he squares his accounts the
quicker he can have a chance to quit being
afraid of his shadder i still hold he must
go into court and tell

  goss broke off the sentence by clutching
his arm fiercely then he murmured his
sister think of the shock to her if he is
accused of murder

  whip king lifted his eyes and beheld a
sweet-faced young woman she had several
small parcels in her arms and her face was
flushed from walking she halted opposite
the men and gazed eagerly about the office
her small face revealed disappointment and
she moved on slowly as if undecided she
started toward the desk hesitated then
turned and hurried up the stairs

  whip king fiercely bit the end from a
cigar and forgot to light it

  hed best keep out of court if he can he
sharply decided ive shifted my bets
twice the young fool ran away if he can
keep out of sight till leapers been hung or
set free folks will forget about the skillings
case by spring california gulch will have
forgotten him heres an idea canon city
is well near empty ancient days has a
little ranch a few miles below it what if he
and his sister go down there and spend the
winter he can take possession if ancient
isnt there theyll be moren welcome if
ancient is there anyway he must get
clear of denver before some of sam browns
boys locate him
ii

adventure

  goss nodded approvingly and indorsed-
now youre drawing to- the full strength
of your hand

  whip king sternly declared if i thought
hed done wrong id give him up to the
authorities

  i wouldnt replied the gambler now
i must go back and tell him about this last
wrinkle and arrange for his leaving town
then the girl must be told

 he reached the grocery store a few
minutes before ellis supper time and waited
outside ellis soon joined him his counte-
nance struggling between worry and delight

  i cant wait a minute was his greeting
to goss id give a million if i had it if
annie hadnt come out like this and yet
i never was so homesick in my life for any-
thing as i am to see her

  cant blame you said goss but the
games getting a little crowded too many
sitting in well walk along and ill tell
you

wwm he led his perturbed compan-
gjslaki ion to the foot of f street where
they could have the privacy of the
ft-issisui river bank nor would the gam-
bler talk untilthey reached the river then
he rapidly outlined the new dangers and
difficulties and repeated whip kings ad-
vice-an immediate departure for canon
city

  after the first feeling of discouragement
ellis was willing to do anything which might
spare his sister trouble

  can you call on her and explain he
asked and arrange for us to meet some-
where

  the gambler shook his head and firmly
insisted

  you must see her and do the explaining
until that notice appears in the news theres
no more danger of you being recognized in
the broadwell than in the store you fol-
low me in and go right upstairs her room
is no  after twenty minutes ill come
up if the young ladys game well pull out
tonight you two in a light rig and i on my
horse ill see you through to canon city
shell do anything for me sighed ellis
and its mighty kind of you to take the
bother i dont know when i can pay back
that hundred

  goss dark face flushed with anger and
he complained

  always the way its always the woman

wholl do anything for a man whos in hard
luck

  but shes my sister reminded ellis

  saltpeter but youre her brother re-
plied goss kept that in the front of
your mind rather than the hundred dollars
its for you to be the one wholl do anything
shes the one who should be helped i had
a glimpse of her she doesnt look much
bigger than a drink

  good heavens nathan id die-any-
thing for annie passionately cried ellis

  i suppose so most men brothers
would at a pinch mumbled goss im
out of sorts from missing my supper youre
all right pilgrim just working in cap
again but you have the best luck in the

world in having a sister - of it with

me is my being an only child well lets
not chase deuces into the grave each of us
cuts open a dog some time or other

  they made for the hotel the gambler de-
claring the time to be propitious as guests
would be busy eating supper they had
expected to find the office practically de-
serted but fresh war news had arrived while
they were talking by the river and many had
gathered from the street to gossip and argue

  when the two entered the office they
found it lively with excited groups the
gambler nodded toward the stairs and as
ellis mounted to find his sister joined a
party of disputants the man standing di-
rectly in front of him back to was warn-
ing

  no - secesh talk here theres a

war on

  cant a man express an honest opinion
without being called a rebel sam brown
demanded an angry citizen

  goss did not linger to hear the mar-
shals reply but shifted his position to
another noisy group closer to the stairs
browns presence was an unexpected dan-
ger he did not know ellis by sight but
he represented the law goss waited and
consulted his watch impatiently he feared
lest ellis descend and be confronted by
the marshal and be asked to give his
name and antecedents at last he was free
to run upstairs and to miss ellis room he
tapped timidly and ellis voice called out-

  whos there

  the voice was uneven and seemed to lack
confidence

  the gambler gave his name and the door

   	early colorado for make a mistake be in error
pards



was unlocked and opened on entering he
was greatly disturbed to observe the girl
trying to erase signs of weeping ellis hur-
riedly explained

  annie this is the friend i was speaking
of nathan goss my sister nate she
doesnt like the idea of hiding

  youve told her everything significant-
ly asked goss he found it impossible to
maintain his poker expression under the
girls questioning gaze

  everything

  more at ease goss told the girl-

  your brother maam isnt to be blamed
for anything except having a streak of hard
luck which comes some time or other to the
best of folks

  but hes the best of folks she quickly
reminded people here must know that
the pilgrim is all right maam agreed
goss but most every one in the territory
is a stranger to most every one else i dont
see as itll do any one any good for him to
give himself up when hes innocent

  not even to clear himself she de-
manded

  some times its the honest man who cant
clear himself he slowly replied not
knowing anything about a certain scally-
wags death he cant say anything except
that he didnt do it theres two men who
know who did it-the murderer and an
indian hunter the first wont tell of
course the last might be induced to al-
though he refused to tell me he stays in
the mountains and comes to camps only to
sell meat it might take all winter to find
him when hes found and says hell talk
then we can walk into court whip king
believes as i do-that your brother better
lose himself for a while

  whip king she repeated her eyes re-
flecting her bewilderment

  master hand with a long whip maam
a man you can hang your hat on trust
him you know

  the girl was perplexed and suspicious of
the quaint talking young man her brother
called friend ellis sensed her prejudice and
hurriedly informed

  not hearing from me for some time and
depending on letters i wrote early in the
season she decided to come out she was
planning to start for california gulch to-
morrow

  all im thinking about now is to get you
back east she told him

  you ought not to have come on a chance
of finding me in bonanza he said

  i think its a mighty fine thing her com-
ing remarked goss his dark eyes flashing

  the girl felt she had been rebuked and
her face was dreary with sadness she
confessed

  im afraid ive been foolish it costs
lots of money to come but i was home-
sick

  it impressed ellis as being odd that one
snugly back in martinsville should be home-
sick goss eagerly insisted

  it was brave of you maam your
brother has been working in cap the whole
season but who knows if he wont strike
rich ore another season he can get work
at canon city friends of ours have a
little ranch near there garden stuff
fetches a good price next spring he can
try prospecting maybe ill go with him
youre a miner mr goss you know
about mines

  there was scepticism in the question
goss had no idea what ellis had told her
he gravely replied

  perhaps a speculator would be near
right maam ive been in the diggings
two years and in my way have taken quite a
few chances

  she walked to the window and stared out
on the town and enigmatically observed
frank is very impressionable i have
worried more about his coming under bad
influence than his failure to find gold its
hard for me to understand how he could get
into such a mess if he was busy digging dirt
and hunting for gold

  her brother flushed and warmly declared-
no man in the mines has better friends
than i have

  they would go into court and testify
to your character she asked without turn-
ing from the window and mr goss
will testify his word will have influ-
ence naturally

  now it was goss dark face that burned
he coldly answered

  i have spent my time in the mines and
camps i know but few people here where
i am known my word goes

  great scott annie there isnt a squarer
man in colorado than nathan goss if
youd seen him run charley dodge out of
oro when dodge had the drop on him---
your sister isnt interested in that
broke in goss


adventure

  im only interested in getting my brother
out of this muddle

  exactly thats my only concern just
now assured goss united states mar-
shal brown is down in the office hes keen
to find your brother as a witness in the
leaper case leapers other victim is
dead if your brother testifies the lawyers
for leaper will try to discredit him theyll
sink tunnels into his past history theyll
turn him inside-out leapers friends will
tell about his flight from california gulch
her face paled and she turned to face
them ellis despairingly groaned

  oh i know its bad almost hopeless i
wish annie youd take a stage and go back
home and leave me to work it out alone
shame on you she told him

  then she was at his side wi th an arm around
his neck and petting him and murmuring
dont worry dear its nothing well
go down to this other city and be very
happy i know in the spring if we think
best well go back east

  martinsville will look mighty fine he
murmured

with a little grimace of pain she told him
not martinsville dear i read your
letters to folks they think youve made
lots of money but theres plenty of other
places where we can go

  if you two have decided to go to canon
city i advise starting at once tonight
spoke up goss

  yes yes tonight agreed ellis the
united states marshal looming an ominous
figure in his thoughts

  then maam ill go down and arrange
for a light rig ten minutes after ive left
your brother can go down the back way
andgo to his lodgings you maam have
your traps taken down to the office eat
your supper and pay your shot in an hour
ill call for you with the rig well pick up
your brother in front of cheesmans drug
store and hell take my place in the carriage
and ill shift to my horse once out of town
we can take it easy ill get plenty of sup-
plies and we can make it a sort of a picnic
he smiled encouragingly but she was
not inclined to an optimistic point of view
for the first time in her life she was con-
fronted with something that frightened her
it was inconceivable in her upright mind
that an ellis ever should have to run from
the law now the impossible was not only
become possible but was even a necessity

she found herself compelled to do some
thing offensive even with the sacrifice
made she would have no guarantee of free-
dom from fear

  her faith in her brother remained he
would not knowingly do anything wrong
he had been insistent on coming to the gold
lands and the venture had cost them almost
all they had their little home then came
glowing letters which seemed abundantly to
vindicate his judgment jealous of his good
name and fearing for his safety she told her-
self he never waded so deeply into misfor-
tune of his own volition some influence
had warped his judgment or deceived him

  as she stared at the smiling dark-faced
young man who seemed so worldly wise she
wondered if he were not the evil influence
he was too smartly attired and in appear-
ance resembled in no way the desirable
young men of martinsville she noted his
hands were more immaculate than many a
girls obviously his speculations did not
involve manual labor then he must be
very keen of wit her prejudice against
him grew she did not understand his queer
speeches and what martinsville did not
comprehend it condemned her upbringing
had been prim and precise the noises the
license of speech the innumerable saloons
and other queer places she had glimpsed in
the short time she had been in the city were
entirely to her disliking

  i will be ready she told goss bowing
stiffly

  after the door closed behind him she turned
on her brother fiercely and demanded-
just who is that man

  nathan goss and a good friend to me
he calls himself a speculator just
what does he speculate in

  ellis views on gambling had been the
same as hers until he had been in california
gulch for a while alone with her the old
wholesome restraint returned sufficient for
him to be ashamed to name his friends occu-
pation as he hesitated she read him as
easily as she had when she was the little
mother and detecting him in mischief

just the truth frank she prompted
hes a good fellow he blurted hes
been good to me gave me courage when i
had none left gone out of his way to
help me

  just the truth frank she gently re-
peated drawing him down on the arm of her
chair
pards



  hes a gambler he confessed then
  outly but an honest one

  an honest gambler she muttered and
nosing her eyes from hopelessness and
dreariness my poor boy you wandered
farther from martinsville than i ever
guessed

chapter vii

the uninvited player

f i owns rather empty remarked goss
as george hall proprietor of the el
progresso saloon and grocery store was
putting up the gamblers order of foodstuffs

  itll soon fill up when the men come back
from fair play california gulch tarryall
and the blue river diggings youre new
to canon city where you stopping
few miles down the river dont ex-
pect to stay long ranch of my friend
ancient day wish hed come back sort
of jumped his place till he shows up

 old ancient eh queer customer
ought to be showing up any time feller in
from california gulch couple days ago
spoke of him saw him and joe hasty-
most folks call joe big bones-as they were
coming off cottonwood creek theyd been
in back somewhere and were about out of
grub im glad joe wasnt having one of
his crazy spells sometimes he has streaks
when he believes the mountains are filled
with monsters

  what had been an animated discussion at
the bar now exploded in threats of violence
hall left the gambler and joined the group
of gesticulating men and pawed them aside
and cried

  simmer down think this is the old cri-
terion in denver trying to talk with folks
in pueblo

  nothing that walks on two legs can
stand afore me and say that gineral stone-
wall jackson- heatedly began an old
man with snow-white hair and youthful
glittering eyes

  softly grandpap soothed hall some
of you are for the north and some for the
south and all are welcome here till you
start fighting then you must quit this
shebang and find another battlefield but
youre all too sensible to start something
thatll end in the kind of fighting thats now
tearing up kansas and missouri we all
know a guerrilla war in these mountains will
make an awful mess without helping north

or south none of us want that think
what you want to but softly softly when it
comes to talking

  but weve got word a bunch of rebs are
at chandlers on chandlers creek and are
bound for texas cried a union man

  what of it if you want to fight them
join the army said hall

  you dont want them here added an-
other citizen dr reid then why object
to their leaving the territory

  youre wishing them luck growled an-
other disgruntled citizen

  you all know where my sympathies
are warmly retorted the doctor ive
never covered anything up yet i set your
leg and youre walking as well as ever
thats true doc and come to think of
it you knew i was a union man when you
patched my bones

  and a few days ago he walked fifty
miles to doctor a man on the greenhorn who
boasts of wanting to hang every secesh
added hall

  oh docs all right if they was all like
him id never open my yap

  if we all were like him there wouldnt be
any war said another and the quarrel
was smothered

  reid was very popular he opened the
first drugstore in canon city building the
small stone house with his own hands he
was wholeheartedly devoted to mending
sick folks in his estimation a patient had
no politics in turning to go the doctor re-
marked-

  if you fellows feel so full-bloodedwhy
not hunt for vicroy down on hardscrabble
and bring him to book for passing bogus
gold dust

  good land let vicroy alone loudly in-
sisted a drunken individual his dust was
about all the currency we had last winter-
that and beaver and deer skins and veni-
son

  this brought a laugh and the bartender
set them up on the house hall returned to
the amused gambler and complained
running this place at times is like work-
ing in a barrel of powder with a lighted
candle every time a fresh batch of war
news comes in the boys smell blood
that way in all the camps still theres
mighty little fighting on account of the war
both sides know whatll happen if reb and
yank ever getting to spilling blood any
games running
n

adventure

  not to amount to anything yet a
month ago only six people here but well
brighten up a lot after the boys get back
feeling lucky

  just want to be doing something

  hall cast a shrewd glance at the polished
boots and carefully fitted coat and lowering
his voice informed

  i can tell you where to find a game so
long as you aint fighting battles for north
or south those men making for texas
arent at chandlers place yet theyre
stopping less n two miles south of here on
grape creek wild bloods full of fight
two were in here and bought grub whisky
and cards all have dust but probably
they wont welcome any one not of their own
way of thinking

  thanks im a fine thinker

  the door of the saloon flew violently open
and abruptly stopped the talking at the bar
a small man with a bristling beard that sug-
gested the quilled coat of a hedgehog fairly
hurled himself over the threshold and across
the room to the group of drinkers goss
glimpsed two furtive forms just outside the
door and at first thought they had been
pursuing the newcomer this belief was
dispelled as the men outside advanced
closer until the bar-rom light touched their
faces long enough for him to recognize them
as ancient days and the man he had known
as big bones as if wishing to avoid recog-
nition they stepped out of the lane of lights
and did not enter

  the little man sounded an inarticulate
cry of disgust and slammed a heavy bag on
the bar and announced

  everlasting fortune gone to -- its
no good cant do a thing with it

  hall nudged goss and whispered
gabriel bowen from the oil springs a
few miles down the river been bragging
all summer about owning a pure lead mine
fussed with it mighty mysterious all the
season some of the boys tried to trail him
but never learned anything except its some-
where in wet mountain valley

  he broke into a chuckle and nodded
toward the window then said by god-
frey i saw ancient peeking in bet hes
been following bowen

  the white-haired man with southern
leanings was now demanding-

  meaning you aint got any mine
look at it snorted bowen pawing the
bag open cant do a thing with it any

one can see it oughter be pure lead but
when i tried to melt it down for bullets its
too hard i vow i dont know what we
poor miners are coming to when the stuff we
find plays such queer capers

  the bartender picked up a handful of the
exhibits and scratched a piece on the bar
his verdict was-

 no good hardern--

  and a seasons work thrown away and
me needing a grub stake wailed bowen
why good land ive counted on this stuff
as youd depend on denver-minted gold
pieces mister hall im in hard luck
again

  the account is pretty long gabriel but
i wont see you starve assured the pro-
prietor youd better go back to washing
out dust

  we all oughter know what this stuff is
said the bartender take it over to the
new assayer in the morning itll be a big
satisfaction to learn what it is now we know
what it aint

  ya-ah snarled bowen after work-
ing all summer to be paid by being told some
finnefied name of worthless ore george
im going to sell that mine to you for fifty
dollars worth of grub then hopefully-
mebbe theres diamonds in it

  hall shook his head firmly and re-
plied 

  mining isnt my business most the
paying mines are lost mines and ancient
days will locate all of those the rest are
mostly holes in the ground that you cant
even use for wells id rather have you owe
me fifty dollars more than to own your
mine gabriel

  goss stepped to the bar and examined
several pieces of the ore bowen eyed him
eagerly and urged

  another may find a fortune where ive
lost out friend im in sore need of fifty
dollars besides georges extra credit ill
put down on paper just how to find that
mine or take you to it for fifty dollars

  i am a gambler i know nothing about
ores said goss but fifty dollars will
never make or break me if hall vouches
for you ill pay fifty for the claim we
wont make a secret of it if any of these
gentlemen want to work it before i get
around to it they are perfectly welcome
ill leave the money with mr hall hell
give it to you after youve written down
directions for finding the spot
pards



  the men laughed amused at the sugges-
tion any of them at the end of the season
would waste time on bowens secret lode
the bartender did not join in the mirth
however he rather resented goss su-
perior clothes and shiny boots he per-
sisted 

  better take it over to the new assayer
hes a hellion at finding out things about
rocks

bowen fingered his bristling
beard and stared undecided at
the black lumps as he gazed he
saw visions like a crystal gazer
his hopes danced before his eyes in con-
crete pictures the pieces of ore took on
facets and radiated blue and white lights
with a deep breath he mumbled

  thanks friend dont think ill sell if
it should be diamonds id feel cheap to
have sold a mountain of them for fifty
dollars

  and he hurriedly began replacing the ore
in the bag

  goss asked for beer and invited the com-
pany to name their preference and after
finishing his glass stepped outside

  close by but hidden by the thirty foot
bank flowed the arkansas in infinite
space overhead burned the stars vivid as
tiny suns the light was sufficient for the
gambler to detect a figure slipping around
the corner of the building he quickly
turned the opposite corner and came upon
two men standing by a window

  its nate goss ancient i saw you and
hasty through the door i wish to have a
word with you

  you know me but i dont know you
spoke up hasty

  good gracious joe if it aint goss the
card player whod thought wed ever
meet down here shake hands with him
joe hes all right and goss my friend
is one of the best men ever in the moun-
tains i met him down the valley from
california gulch and he poked his fist
sharply into goss ribs now lets step
aside but keep near enough to watch this
place you can talk before joe no
secrets from him

  hasty accepted goss as a stranger and the
gambler said-

  im glad to-meet you bones

  look here mister youre gitting ac-
quainted too fast warned hasty only

friends can call me that and they know i
dont like it

  ancient poked goss for the second time
and explained-

  its a foolish nick name joe dont take
to

  im not against nicknames as a rule but
i dont like that one said hasty it
sounds foolish

  ill remember mr hasty now sup-
pose we walk over in front of dr reids
drug store

  as they crossed the street ancient days
kept glancing over his shoulder and mur-
mured

  its that gabe bowen hes located
something rich and we allow to be close to
the discovery claim

  his lead mine is a joke he doesnt
know what he found but it isnt lead hes
very much discouraged informed goss
offered to sell it for fifty dollars then de-
cided to have it assayed but theres noth-
ing there for you to trail

  ill be derned grunted ancient wed
done better joe to have saved our feet in-
stead of following him

  seasons too late for us to stay out much
longer well happen around at the assay-
ers place in the morning you two have
your pow-wow while i fill and smoke

  he walked close to the lighted window
and whittled a pipe of tobacco goss
abruptly began-

 you know your ranch down the
river

  ought to seeing its mine joen me
are going down there soon he got his
senses back about fifteen miles down the
arkansas or about the spot where he was
took by the spell that made him hunt cover
in california gulch he dont remember
anything about being in the gulch thats
why he dont remember you

  that ranch you own its occupied
like --- it is fiercely cried ancient
sucking in his breath with a hissing sound
i still carry a long knife in my boot ill
go down and see the dadbusted claim
jumper

  two of them continued goss i
sent them there its the singing pilgrim
and his sister hes in trouble and keeping
out of sight the girl came unexpectedly
from the east

  for nearly a minute ancient was speech-
less


adventure

  the pilgrim he finally exclaimed
and hes got a sister

  young woman rather pleasing to look
at but not used to the country nor our
ways you see its like this

  and he briefly explained the cause of
ellis flight from the gulch in concluding
he said

   some one killed skillings but ellis didnt
the rabbit knows who did but wont tell
ellis and his sister havent much money
your place seemed a good one for them to
stay on through the winter by spring the
skillings killing will be forgotten and the
pilgrim can try to work out of cap and get
hold of a stake before taking his sister back
east

  it was nearly a minute before ancient
spoke then he said-

  you figure they wont be looking for him
next season

   i feel very sure

  mighty thoughtful of you to send them
down to my place joen me will look up
another place

  and youre busted of course

  of course but george halls a pretty
good feller hell grub-stake us and now
joes got back his wits well soon be in bo-
nanza never was such a cuss as joe to
hound down rich diggings tie aint hit
anything rich yet along of his crazy spells
but hes got it in him feel sure the pil-
grim wont be troubled next season

  very sure if he keeps close this winter
fetched him down here from denver where
they were looking for him

  - as close as that youd spose

theyd give a man a present for killing that
skunk by all means tell him to stay on
the ranch and to keep close and goss if
any trouble should come to him sort of un-
expected id take it kindly if youd git word
to me

  hell be all right but why not sell that
ranch to me ill buy and give you a
chance to buy it back whatll you take
for it

  well now well now excitedly cried
ancient thatll be fine for me n joe
then regretfully

  but it isnt stocked or nothing just a
stout log cabin and some land i found the
cabin deserted and took it over built on
another cabin and cut a door through
jesse frazer lives a mile below me he says
farming will pay but i dunno grass-

hoppers and everything i aint no farmer
thats a fact frazer says its good orchard
country but i dont believe it still my
place is worth something lands good as
frazers and hes raised vegetables and
mexican corn and did his first plowing with
a forked cottonwood ive told you all i
know about the place make me an offer
but mind you the young folks are welcome
to stay as long as they like and id love to be
with em

  of course i understand but with you
and joe there it might be crowded the
young lady will feel better if only her
brother is around ill give you six hundred
for it you can buy it back for that price
after theyre through with it

  time theyre through with it ill be
buying a stone house in denver with all the
eastern fixings joen me have planned all
that out warmly replied ancient and
goss you are the handsomest man i ever
saw even with your back to the light you
look like a tall angel how long do you
opine itll take you to find that six hun-
dred

  just long enough to go inside the store
and borrow paper pen and ink

  hooray thank --- and nate goss
joey were going to eat

  hasty quickly advanced ancient ex-
plained

  just struck a small pocket ive been
overlooking come along and see what the
first pan runs

  weve been living on smoking tobacco
for the last dayn a half mister informed
hasty as he put up his pipe and eagerly ac-
companied the two into the store

  dr reid supplied paper and ink and the
transaction was soon recorded and witnessed
by the doctor he did not know goss and
glanced at his boots and clothes rather scep-
tically as he congratulated

  im glad to see our young men go in for
land frazer is already setting out fruit
trees and the valley will soon be producing
what the mountains require

   nate is one of the slickest card players in
colorado proudly informed ancient days

  im sure hell find crops and fruit grow-
ing and a dairy herd a much better invest-
ment in the long run politely replied the
doctor

  goss was slightly perturbed by the
speech he was recalling governor evans
remark overheard in the broad well house
pards



when his excellency had characterized
gambling as a phase something transient
less directly dr reid had said the same
thing after the three had returned to the
street goss sternly told his companions-
if either of you ever meet up with the
pilgrim or his sister you neednt mention
that i ever play cards

  hiding your light under a basket
sniffed ancient such a thing as a man
being too modest but what you say goes
now well go to halls and see if we can
make pikes peak hear us hoot

   its a winters grubstake dont throw
your money away goss said but having
little faith in the restraining influence of his
warning

  ill watch over him grufby assured
hasty he shant make a fool of himself
this time ancient you hand over half that
money well drink tother half

   youre hard not to trust me joey re-
buked ancient im dividing it in the
dark and he halted long enough to
separate the gold and script into two por-
tions

 on entering the saloon goss
a excused himself from partaking of
ancients treat and lost no time in
paying for the provisions since
giving ellis money at twin lakes he had
purchased two horses for himself and
euclid and had insisted on ellis accepting a
second loan the night they departed from
denver these expenditures and loans
added to the six hundred dollars paid for
the ranch left considerably less than a
thousand dollars out of the two thousand
dollars he had possessed on the eve of leav-
ing california gulch

  the two thousand had been his reserve
-fund when he took from it he was un-
easy until it was restored his vocation
called for capital he never played so
shrewdly and successfully he believed as
when having ample funds he considered
it to be imperative that he increase his capi-
tal at once he spoke again to hall about
the miners camping on grape creek

  theyre wild-looking fellows showed
plenty of dust in paying for their grub and
whisky from their talk i could see they
had hit it rich one of the best crowds in
the world for you to keep away from in
the morning theyll ride across to chan-
dlers creek avoiding the valley road

  thanks ill leave my supplies here and
call for them in the morning if i forget to
come back send them down to ancients
ranch by him or frazer or any of the
neighbors

  now you know better than to do this
remonstrated hall youre too likely a
young man to hurry yourself into a hole in
the ground or into grape creek im mighty
sorry i mentioned those fellows

  thats the best bet on the table
heartily agreed goss good night

  he was through the doorway unheeding
ancient days pleading that he tarry for just
one snifter he had left his horse hitched
in front of the stone house one hundred feet
long built by majors and russell in the
flush days before the war and when canon
city could boast of a larger stock of
goods than could be found even in den-
ver

  he was soon clear of the town the few
lighted houses and those silent and empty
the utes fire on signal mountain had
burned out he forded the river and took
the wet mountain valley path that led
through the grape creek canon

  matured in the wet mountain valley and
garnished with the wild vines that give its
name grape creek has conquered the red
rocks and takes its ease between gently
sloping hills as it nears the arkansas under
the starlight goss could discern the shape of
these hills clothed with stunted spruce and
pinon as he rode up the creek

  there were stretches of grass and where
the soil was thin and poor there were the
sharp points of bush cactus but the
gamblers thoughts were not on the beauties
of the starlit hills as he slowly rode search-
ing ahead for a light and listening for sounds
of a carousal

  he halted on hearing the dull report of a
pistol after a few minutes of waiting
without the ominous sound being repeated
he rode on rounding a curve in the trail
he came in sight of two yellowish blurs of
light and knew his journey had ended he
dismounted and led his horse forward until
he could make out the squat outlines of a
log house th rowing the reins over the
low-hanging branch of a spruce he recon-
noitered one of the lighted windows

  that there was no tragedy attached to
the pistol shot was evidenced by the strains
of dixie coming through the glassless
window also he could hear a man talking


adventure

loudly and an angry man was swearing vig-
orously some distance from the house he
halted and studied that portion of the room
framed by the window he could see the
head of a man sitting at a table facing the
window closer to the window was a mans
back who was picking up cards

  satisfied the shot was a bit of high spirits
and that he was not stumbling on to a
homicide the gambler returned to the path
before the house and gave a hail

  the talking stopped instantly and he
heard what he believed to be a rifle barrel
sliding over the window sill then a voice
demanded-

  whos out there

  a wanderer looking for entertainment
  if theres only one come in if theres

moren one ride like-

  im alone im coming in announced
goss feeling of his left sleeve holster and its
deadly derringer

  he threw open the door and stood on the
threshold and bowed to several men

  i heard the sound of singing he said as
the occupants stared at him in silence

  i am the songster announced the man
at the head table and he shook back long
black hair that fell to his shoulders and
gazed sharply at the newcomer

  goss decided he had never seen a more
reckless visage the expression of wildness
was intensified by a scar that extended from
from the bridge of the nose to the chin in
healing it had puckered the left eyelid and
gave a peculiarly sinister cast of counte-
nance this individual shuffled the cards
expertly and in a soft musical voice in-
quired-

  how many brave lads ride after you
none ride after me or with me i ride
alone replied goss

  youre bound for wet mountain val-
ley

  i am more anxious to find card trouble
confessed goss i shall ride till i find it
you are properly outfitted continued
the musical voice

  i have nearly a thousand i wish to in-
crease it

  it isnt much but it will help close
the door your travels have ended take
a seat and he nodded to a small soap box
my name is de louge

  im nathan goss

  gambler

  a square one

  youre welcome till your moneys gone
were playing twenty-five limit all jacks
when only two hands are fighting the limit
can be lifted by mutual agreement youll
learn the rest of our names as fast as you
can remember them

  goss seated himself at de louges left
making six at the rough table one man
was snoring heavily in a corner and another
was wild drunk near the fire the latter
was waving a revolver de louge noting
the gamblers gaze dwelling on the drunken
man explained

  hes harmless fired his gun into the
chimney hasnt any more loads show
color

  goss placed a handful of gold and a roll of
paper money before him and received cards
with scarcely a glance at his hand he passed
the man on his left opened and he quicklv
discovered none of the players was under
the influence of liquor sufficiently to play
recklessly one round of play gave him
some idea of each players temperament
and he found his interest centering on the
man opposite this man crowed like a
rooster and boasted of his skill as if wishing
to irritate his companions in reckless bet-
ting the money heaped before him showed
he had been a heavy winner as he raked
in a small pot he taunted

  if youd had nerve to raise me back
any one of you id dropped i didnt have
anything makes me laugh to see you boys
dig for cover the minute i open my yawp
play your cards and stop your foolish-
ness burt when you lose youll be ugly
enough and lose you will before the
nights- over no man can hold such a
streak for long this from the man at the
end of the table on goss left

  burt laughed loudly and warned

  next time im going to take the rest of
your pile seth lucks with me cant
stop me make it every time i draw or else
bluff you out of it

  on the next hand goss passed the man
beside him called snap and opened the
pot for five dollars seth sullenly entered
the next man threw down his cards and
with an oath quit the table and seated him-
self on the floor with a whisky bottle be-
tween his legs

  joeys cleaned out like he was when he
come to the mountains exulted burt
then he held up two cards and announced-
four spots each
pards



  and he placed them face up on the table
and challenged-hundred on the side i
beat any three card draw

  de louge gently deposited his hand on
the discard and murmured-

  youve made most of your winnings on
side bets burt

  goss pushed a hundred in gold to one side
and murmured-

  ill try you

  de louge appeared to be pleased and re-
minded-

  newcomers always spoil winners luck
burt

  burt crowed defiantly and repeated-
  nothing can stop me tonight

  play the game growled seth

  goss made it the limit to draw cards
snap who had opened hesitated then de-
cided to stay seth swore violently and
dropped out burt jeered him for a few
seconds then lost his grin and stared bale-
fully at goss but could read nothing in the
expressionless face he hesitated for a
moment then decided

  twenty-five more to draw cards my
lucks with me tonight

  goss holding a pair of aces promptly
raised back snap shrilly protested

its a cutthroat game cant even git
a chance to draw tens and nines opened
and you didnt have guts to play them
against a pair of four sneered burt push-
ing in his money but refusing to raise back

  i aint scared of you burt damon
yelped snap its this new feller who aint
fool enough to show his cards

  burt leaned forward waiting for the gam-
bler to draw he drew a deep breath of
relief when goss called for three cards and
informed

  of course i knew you had me beat at the
go-in but im a hoss on the draw

  goss did not look at his cards but stacked
them on his pair while his half-closed eyes
watched burt who snatched at each card
greedily and could not hide his exultation on
beholding the third

  goss glanced at his hand and an-
nounced-

  pots yours

  and he shoved his hand into the discard
scared out angrily yelled burt throw-
ing down his hand face up

  he had caught a third four then he
reached out his hand to examine goss
cards the gambler caught his wrist with

his left hand and with his right deftly mixed
the cards

  i dropped he reminded

  burt made no effort to release his wrist
but the whites of his eyes were very con-
spicuous as he stared into the dark face of
the gambler delouge had watched the
two with his thin lips twisted up on one side
as goss released his hold burt hoarsely
panted-

  -- you you placed hands on me
play the game when i stick you can
see my cards-not when i drop

  burt rested an elbow on the edge of the
table and his chin in his hand and slowly in-
formed-

  ill look at the next hand you drop if i
happen to be curious

  play cards curtly replied goss when
we reach that hand well discuss it

  delouge shook with silent laughter
seth of the sullen face complained

  no one can beat burt making good on
a pair of fours

  and he sought to relieve his disgust by
resorting to the whisky

 delouge chuckled-

  now youre driving your luck up the
chimney by growing angry

  seths sour face grew more animated at
this suggestion burt slowly assured
when my luck takes a turn it takes a
turn when it does itll be worse luck for
some one else

there followed several rapid
plays with goss and burt clashing
in two of them seth exulted
hes hogged a big hole in your
pile burt hes busted your luck into
smithereens now we other fellers stand
a show of getting some good cards

  burt wet his dry lips and glanced stonily
at his depleted winnings the man at the
fireplace now reeled to the table snapping
his empty revolver and took a position be-
hind burt it was delouges deal and
goss passed after glancing at his cards and
refused to play when burt opened on his
own deal he dropped out without taking
cards with his winnings savagely eaten
into and with his only successful opponent
refusing to play two hands running burt
muttered under his breath goss had re-
covered his losses and had added some seven
hundred dollars to his pile when he refused
to play the second time burt told him


adventure

  so thats your game waiting for a sure
thing you dont like to take chances just
come in when youve got them all eh
that would be safe poker playing
mumbled goss as he picked up the hand
dealt by snap

  seth groaned on finding openers and
opened against his inclination burt
promptly raised for cards delouge stayed
as did goss snap threw down his hand
and announced he had had enough and
gathering up what remained of his money
quit the game standing while he completed
his deal

  goss shifted his box down the table to
have more room and called for one card
standing on three tens and a queen he
picked up a queen seth dropped his hand
and retired from the table

  ill play these announced burt
delouge hesitated and hummed a bit of
the old love song under his breath and
whimsically remarked-

  probably cutting open another dog
one card

  seth started the play for five dollars
burt promptly raised the limit delouge
did likewise goss stayed burt grinned
triumphantly and raised the limit again
and eagerly suggested

  what about the three of us lifting the
limit

  not on your-luck murmured de-
louge seeing the raise

  and twenty-five more announced goss 
  to you cried burt

  delouge leaned back and examined his
cards shook his head and carefully slipped
his hand into the discard and sorrowfully
informed-

  gentlemen i am burying the rottenest
set of threes i ever held

  and twenty-five said goss

  to you what about wiping out the
limit demanded burt

  i have about fifteen hundred dollars in
front of me bet up to that

  by -- at last ive cut your comb
mister man who dont want folks to see his
hand

  and with feverish haste he pushed for-
ward his money and without waiting to see
goss hand he crowed shrilly and threw
down four nines and an ace and started to
rake in the pot

  the tipsy man behind him laughed loudly
and cried-

heres some youre forgetting burt
and he unsteadily thrust a hand into the
mans lap and picked up three cards in the
few moments of dramatic silence he cheer-
fully explained-

  you dropped em burt when the
stranger was shifting his box to git more
room

  goss spread out his cards and with a
quick movement of his left hand and arm
drew the money to his side of the table

  delouge kicked back from the table
the scar on his face growing livid burt
screamed like a wild animal and leaped to
his feet at the same moment drawing a
bowie knife from his boot before a hand
could be raised to stay his bloody purpose
he plunged the weapon into the side of the
grinning drunken man killing him on his
feet almost in the same second he wheeled
and with uplifted knife lunged across the
table to stab goss the gamblers hand
plucked the derringer from his left cuff and
fired as the man was almost upon him

  what doings are these yelled seth
glaring wild-eyed at burt sprawled across
the table shot between the eyes and then
at the murdered man on the floor

  delouges lips crept up on one side dis-
closing his teeth

  this must be settled here he hoarsely
whispered and his hand sank to his belt

  goss shifted the derringer to his left hand
and covered delouge while he drew a heavy
gun with his right standing he an-
nounced 

  i protected myself he is still clutching
the knife he used in one murder keep your
hand from that gun delouge

  for a bit only the snores of the drunken
sleeper and the deep breathing of seth and
snap disturbed the quiet of the room
then delogue softly said-

  you and your hatchet-face we were
peaceful and friendly till you came we
were pards we came to colorado to-
gether we were going home together
now two of us have been wiped out

  im going announced goss turning
over the soap box without removing his gaze
from delouge with his foot he moved
the box under the edge of the table and
pawed the gold and paper money into it

  im going delouge the first move
made to stop me will kill you your friend
stole his hand from the discard i held the
winning hand he has killed a man and i
pards



saved my life by killing him im going
delouge it depends on you if theres to be
more killings

  he began slowly backing to the door
pushing the box behind him with his foot
as he maneuvered thus his widely opened
eyes seemed to be watching the three men
although his gaze was concentrated on
delouge

  the box was shoved to one side and his
free hand reached behind him and opened
the door delogue bending slightly for-
ward his twisted lips snarling more broadly
waited for the second when the gun barrel
should waver but the gambler never
ceased his cat-like watchfulness as he hooked
a foot into the box and worked it over the
threshold

  delouges distorted lips wrinkled as he
saw the climax almost upon him for an
instant his fierce eyes darted a glance at the
square opening that served as a window and
he was prepared to attack the instant the
gambler followed the box and closed the
door

  but goss halted in the doorway and com-
manded-

  seth come here

 stay where you are ordered delouge

  come her with hands up or ill shoot
delouge and then shoot you

  for-s sake go seth shrilly begged

snap

  the mans bluffing he doesnt want
any more shooting said delouge but he
did not again countermand the gamblers
order

  seth unwillingly advanced to the door-
way his hands high above his head goss
spun him about and with his free hand
ripped a gun from his belt and tossed it
into the darkness behind him then he
warned

  if you people want more bloodshed you
shall have it i won fair against a cheat i
killed a murderer to escape from being mur-
dered step backward seth and pick up
that box

  the man obeyed and when he stood up
with the box in his hands goss stood be-
hind him the revolver resting on his shoul-
der and always covering delouge but the
latter was patient his attack could not be
initiated until the door closed then he
would leap to the window and commence

shooting but the door was left open and
he was left framed in the light while the two
men backed away into the darkness

  with a yell of rage delouge started for
the door the gambler fired the bullet
whistling unpleasantly close to the infuri-
ated mans head and bringing him to a halt

  seth howled as the explosion deafened
him and he all but dropped the box en-
tirely reckless of the consequence to himself
or his companion delouge whipped out a
gun and began firing into the darkness but
goss now had seth by the collar and was
directing his steps down the creek to where
he had left the horse nor did the man
need any prompting now that delouge was
raking the darkness with first one gun and
then another

  they came to the horse and goss com-
manded-

  make for the cabin and step fast

  seth started running and jumping from
side to side as if he were a visible target
and he kept crying-

  dont shoot delouge its me dont
shoot delouge its me

  mounting and holding the box before him
goss rode down the creek path behind
him cracked guns rifles now being used as
well as revolvers but the lead was sent by
guess passing the curve in the trail goss
took time to stuff the money into his pockets

by warm etifflt csmrn

 author of the tangled warp sword fishiri  etc

ashed to the wheel of the sword-
fishing schooner pelamon the
squat frame of captain dan old-
ham dripped the salt water of
combers that crashed over the stern the
seven men of his crew were bound to the
fore and mainmast ratlines awaiting what
were likely to be the last moments of the
sturdy little fishing vessel

  the west indian hurricane had caught
the pelamon unawares early that afternoon
it came without warning other than a slight
drop in the barometer it had suddenly
swept northward-a huge wave followed
by a veritable tornado which brought with
it the heaviest seas captain dan had experi-
enced in a sailing career of over forty years

  his brown eyes were wide the severe
lines of his masterful rotund face were grim
as an owls it was a fighting face-yet
on less serious occasions it was as genial as
that of a boy whom threescore years had
aged only by graying the sparse brown hair
a little and widening somewhat the plump
waistline

  nor did the men lashed to the ratlines
betray their fears by their facial expressions
though terror must have crept into the hearts
of them there was one who showed his
white teeth in mocking laughter though it
was not wholly apparent whether it was
from diabolic mirth or hysteria

  most sober of all in the ratlines was the
big broad-shouldered fellow in the blue
mackinaw his heavy brows were con-
tracted his square countenance was that
of a pugilist who is seeking an opening in
his antagonists defense

  but there was no opening in the gale
through which the pelamon could strike to
shake herself of its deadly embrace so
suddenly had the hurricane swooped down
upon her there had been no time to lower the
foresail which providentially was the only
rag up when the storm broke

  as the great waves smashed down on her
stern nosing her into a hollow and bearing
her quivering up on the crest of the suc-
ceeding comber it seemed as if fate alone
prevented her from diving into a huge sea
and never coming up if a wave should
crash down full on her deck it would swamp
her like a lobster pot the men lashed to
the ratlines were well aware of this captain
dan expected it to happen momentarily

  but fighter that he was deep in his stub-
born heart there was hope-hope that came
from prayers that had been answered on
similar though less arduous occasions oc-
casionally his lips moved

  in the ratlines they were pointing to
port on the crest of a comber dan looked
in that direction he glimpsed the shadowy
form of a two-masted schooner running
skippers off georges



with main and foresails up traveling like a
flying dutchman downwind a driving rain
was now starting in and to the turmoil of
wind and wave was added darkness which
deepened rapidly into the chaos of night al-
though it was mid-afternoon chaos-that
described it it was as if the pdamon
and her crew were whirling through space
through an infinite void of endless water
bottomless interminable

  the neighboring schooner disappeared in
the downpour which followed not even
the flash of chain lightning which pierced
the gloom marked her position again to
dans anxiously watching eyes he knew
that vessel was in a worse fix than the pd-
amon lucky she would be if her flapping
mainsail did not contribute toward founder-
ing her he had not seen enough of her to
know what type of schooner she was but
he was reasonably sure she was not a
swordfisherman for swordfishermen off the
lightship usually use a riding sail instead of
a mainsail but whatever she was she was
in a bad way-a decidedly bad way

  through the hurricane which increased in
violence as night came slowly the pdamon
wallowed wallowed like a seal her fore-
sail giving her just enough steerage way for
her skipper to hold her hove-to and avoid
the deadly trough of the waves which had
she ever drifted into them broadside would
surely have swamped her

  toward night the wind worked around to
the northward captain dan wearily taking
his buffeting at the wheel noted the change
of wind with another fervent prayer-this
one a prayer of thanksgiving for in spite
of the cold which chilled him to the bone
he knew that the worst of the hurricane was
over that the gale which had had its birth
on the equator must succumb to the counter
current from the arctic much as a native of
tropical climes must sooner or later surrender
to the chill of the ice fields if he attempts
to combat it in equatorial attire

  it was a little after seven by the nickel
watch in the binnacle when dan cut him-
self loose from his lashings the sea still
ran high and the wind and rain howled and
drummed but the storm was spent it was
now little more than an ordinary blow

  the men who came on deck from the rat-
lines made a hasty inspection of the pdamon
captain dan joining them ike crowe held
the wheel they found everything intact-
no leak no sign of sprains from stem to stern

in the stanch schooners maine-built hull
even the sorely tried foresail had held

  thank the lord piously exclaimed
captain dan repairing with the others to
the forecastle where they assiduously ran-
sacked the cooks supply of doughnuts bis-
cuits and cold corned beef

  did ye sight that schooner skipper
asked mel frost the square-faced giant in
the blue mackinaw sitting on the bench
which surrounded the interior of the fore-
castle a mug of cold tea in one hand and a
partly gnawed doughnut in the other

  shes in for a hard time of it com-
mented captain dan stuffing the greater
part of a biscuit into his capacious mouth
did ye git a good look at her mel

she looked to me like a swordfisherman
turned into a coaster answered mel bolt-
ing the remain der of the doughnut  looked
to me a good eal like the eva thomas
the eva thomas exclaimed the skipper

what the-would she be doinout here

  what dye spose shed be doin any-
where retorted mel with that fool
oliver thomas skipperin her why shed
be blowed out o her course an thats how

i	account fr sightin her capn oliver i
calclate started from new york for boston
an was headed for o muskeget channel in-
stead o goin through the sound

         under ordinary circumstances
captain dan would have been
the the first to identify the eva
tl t thomas for only last year at
the close of an unsuccessful swordfishing
season the pdamon had collided with the
eva in a fog outside boston harbor al-
though the collision was to all appearances
wholly accidental captain oliver thomas
claimed it was dans fault and he and
his father captain ira thomas owner of
the eva brought suit against him

  to the amazement of seafaring men
captain ira won and collected three thou-
sand dollars damages from dan coupled
with his unprofitable fishing trips of the past
six or seven years this award almost ruined
dan financially he knew captain oliver
thomas had lied in court and that captain
iras crafty lawyers had trumped up the
charge of captain dans negligence which
they claimed had caused the damage to the
two vessels they didnt tell how the eva
had been condemned the previous year as
unseaworthy


adventure

  as a matter of fact the pelamons bow
had been crushed in almost as badly as the
evas dap still owed the shipbuilders for
the repairs on his schooner which the col-
lision had necessitated and if it hadnt
been for mel frost captain dan would
have gone under financially-that is if his
swordfishing that summer had been as un-
profitable as that of the past six years

  but this summer it looked as if the pela-
mon would be the high-line schooner of the
entire swordfishing fleet already on her
fourth trip of the season one hundred and
sixteen swordfish carcasses were iced down
in her hold added to the five hundred and
eleven swordfish she had brought to the
boston market on her three previous trips
that season that trip would put her well
over the top for the honor which all fisher-
men covet along with its splendid financial
reward

  and captain dan did not keep mel in
ignorance that he and not the skipper was
responsible for that seasons success there
was a time-it began ten years ago-when
captain dan was repeatedly high-liner of
the new england swordfishing fleet then
after reigning as high-liner for four years
the pelamon ceased to bring in the largest
catches strange that dan had failed all
at once for he had the same crew-with one
exception

  and that exception in the old crew he
had shipped prior to this summer was the
very captain oliver thomas with whom he
had collided at sea and in court a year ago
oliver was in the early twenties when he had
sailed with captain dan-a dull unattrac-
tive chap worthless as a fisherman cap-
tain dan would never have shipped him
had not olivers father captain ira been
one of dans seafaring acquaintances

  captain ira was well-to-do captain dan
had been less fortunate easy-going and
kind-hearted the skipper of the pelamon
had never been able to save much money
he trusted captain iras judgment in busi-
ness matters often going to him for advice
and reciprocating by selling ira his fish-for
ira was a fish buyer as well as skipper his
office was in boston

  so ten years ago after dans first crew
had given up seafaring and taken shore
jobs captain ira obtained for dan that
crew which until six years ago had made
him high-liner it was a decidedly more effi-
cient crew than his first one from freetown

the pelamons decadent southeastern mas-
sachusetts home port it was that second
crew which ten years ago had made cap-
tain dan high-liner of the fleet

  captain dan shipped oliver along with
the pelamons second crew to please his
father but oliver was always in the way-
a pretentious boastful cub who seemed to be
bent on having his own way regardless of
others dan stood him as long as he could
-exactly two seasons then he fired him
and in his place shipped mel frost then a
green friendless bluenose from yarmouth
nova scotia

  the break between captain dan and
captain ira followed the discharge of oli-
ver from the pelamon the two skippers
had never spoken to each other since that
memorable wordy battle--which nearly re-
sulted in fisticuffs

  the rise of mel frost under dans
and other skippers tutelage from one
of the clumsiest swordfishermen to the
best all-round member of any crew in the
fleet is still discussed when schooners speak
one another off georges and grand banks
or their crews gather winter nights around
blazing wood fires ashore

  how mel did it no one can definitely
fathom-except that he suddenly found
himself at any rate mel stayed in cap-
tain dans crew two years then left dan
and shipped with other skippers two
years ago he surprized the fishing world
by purchasing captain thrashers schooner
victory shipping in her his own crew and
straightway winning the honor of high-liner
with great profit to himself and his ship-
mates he had repeated that triumph the
following year

  but mel traced his success to captain
dans interest in him in those days when
the successful bluenose was only a green-
horn who was scarcely worth his salt he
came to captain dan after the swordfish-
ing season the previous year and advised the
old skipper to discharge his crew that was
after the pelamons collision with the eva

  its them fellers captain ira hired for
ye ten yars ago declared mel who are
keepin yer profits down they were be-
ginnin to do it when i shipped with ye the
fust time capn ira has sworn hed run
ye off the water hes payin your crew
what theyre losin by low shares hes
never gotten over havin oliver turned back
on his hands
skippers off georges



  but where can i git a new crew asked
captain dan

  thats what ive come to see ye bout
answered mel youre short on funds
but one yar o good fishin would put ye on
your feet an youd have no trouble
gittin a crew after that so ive decided
to tie up the victory fr one season an give
ye her crew-includin me ill welcome
the change skipperin aint wholly to my
likin an money never had much at-
traction for me

  mel and his crew true to mels word
shipped in the pelamon they soon proved
that captain dans adversities were due to
something more than hard luck mels dead-
ly striking of the harpoon and the deftness
with which his crew handled ironed sword-
fish when they hauled them in dories-all
convinced captain dan that mel was right

  mel had been intimate with captain ira
too when he was ashore there was a
rumor that ira wanted to buy the victory
but it was later said that captain ira had
behaved like a wild man when he was first
apprised of mels sailing in the pelamon
captain ira had promptly signed dans
second crew in his big beam trawler cornier
a huge steam craft which he owned in ad-
dition to the decrepit coaster eva thomas
the comber had been chasing mackerel that
summer off georges no doubt captain
ira was even more venomous than before
since dan bade fair to be high-liner

  captain dan thought of all this during
the silence in the forecastle

  mel he declared rising and starting
toward the ladder to climb on deck and
study the weather without you i never
never would a paid expenses i aint
much moren done that the last four years
well show luke carey what he missed
chuckled mel good-humoredly hell wish
hed stayed with me stead o signin up with

that-captain ira in the comber

  for luke carey was the only one of mels
crew who had dissented when he hauled up
the victory and turned his crew over to cap-
tain dan

hard aport hard aport
down the jibstay slid mel
frost into the pulpit at the tip
of the pelamons bowsprit the
mastheader shiny morton had sighted
the curved dorsal fin of a swordfish basking

in the warm sunlight the huge fish wallow-
ing lazily in the oily ground swell the
other four men in the three crosstrees of the
tall foremast-head took up the masthead-
ers cry and at the wheel captain dan
hopped nimbly getting the schooner down
on the unsuspecting quarry

  mel his long-visored black cap pulled
down to shade his eyes in the glaring sun-
light picked up the fifteen-foot harpoon
pole from the waist-high iron hand rail and
lowered it slowly over the port side of the
bowsprit on the downward-pointing tip
of the pole glinted the metal arrow-shaped
lily-iron harpoon from which ran the
warp or harpoon line along the starboard
rail amidships was coiled the great length
of the warp one hundred fathoms its other
end fast to a black buoy-keg

  steady shouted the men in the mast-
head

  steady echoed captain dan twirling
the wheel

  just then the swordfish seemed to scent
danger it moved its tail in a graceful
spiral and shot along the surface like a
torpedo there is only one deep-sea crea-
ture that can travel with the speed of a
swordfish and that is a porpoise in an
actual race between the two the sword-
fish would be championed by more than
one of the new england skippers who are
familiar with its terrific speed

  if ever a swordfish traveled it was that
three-hundred-pounder for whose life blood
the crew of the pelamon were thirsting but
the agitated monster made one mistake-a
mistake that would have been insignificant
with anybody but mel frost in the pulpit
it shaped its hurried course to starboard of
the pelamon with a safe margin of approxi-
mately thirty feet between it and the swing-
ing pulpit which captain dan was just in
the act of bearing straight ahead

the lily iron flashed as mel brought the
pole up with a quick motion his great
arms raised the pole like a javelin about to
be hurled only no javelin thrower ever
acted with his uncanny speed ever took
such a hasty aim-at least with any hope
of hitting the mark however large at which
the javelin was to be thrown

  out flew the pole darting like a gunshot
at the v-shaped wake of a swordfish travel-
ing so fast that the scimitar-shaped fin cut-
ting the surface appeared to be a blurry
straight line of black the men in the


adventure

masthead watched breathlessly observing
that either by instinct or sheer luck mel had
miraculously timed the passage of the pole
through the air with due allowance for the
speed of its target the pole nosed into
the water--

   by -- hes got him burst out shiny
 from the masthead

   bill alden the sleek cook in white cap
 and apron had come up from the fore-
 castle when shiny first sighted the sword-
 fish and was paying out the warp hand over
 hand

  a solid iron-firm as a rock he an-
nounced as he threw over the remaining
coils and the keg ive seen shots with
the pole but never the likes o that one

   mel grinning with satisfaction walked
 along the bowsprit to the fore deck steady-
 ing himself by an overhead line ike crowe
 was coming down the ratlines for it was his
 turn to go out in a dory and haul the ironed
 fish

  by gum-that was beautiful mel the
skipper commended mel proudly as the big
striker walked aft he was thinking of how
mel had received his instruction in harpoon-
ing from him and giving himself just a small
part of the credit for the remarkable shot

  twas luck declared mel unassum-
ingly dyou mind if i haul him too
skipper

  mind lord sakes mel-youre capn
o the pdaman this trip consented captain
dan any man whos done for me what

you have can do jest about as he -

 pleases furs im concerned

   the skipper was holding the painter to the
 dory dragging astern mel jumped into
 the little boat while ike crowe looked on
 a littie piqued that mel had taken the job
 of hauling the swordfish away from him
 captain dan cast mel the painter and
 with long strokes the striker rowed out to
 the keg and picked it up

   go out in the pulpit ike the skipper
 commanded crowe you do the strikin
 while mels out for crowe was mels
 understudy

   crowe went into the pulpit and captain
 dan opened the engine sending the pela-
 mon ahead in quest of more game in the
 dory mel was skilfully playing the sword-
 fish while that agonized monster kept in
 deep water moving rapidly in its struggling
 -and towing the dory behind it as long as
 the fish stayed in deep water and kept in

motion it would slowly drown itself but

if it came to the surface--

  mel began to haul in the warp more and
more rapidly he backed toward the soli-
tary bow thwart still pulling in the slack
line captain dan swung the schooner
encircling the fisherman out there alone in
the dory for the slack line was a danger
signal it meant that unless the sword-
fish had torn itself loose from the iron it
was charging the dory sword-first

  mel fell back lost his balance and
sprawled on the bottom of the dory at
the same time the little boat rocked vio-
lently

  christopher sakes exclaimed captain
dan mels been punched-an unless
im mistaken hes hurt

  toward the dory captain dan held the
pelamon he saw mel rise slowly then
sink down again from the masthead of
the schooner the anxious crew scurried down
the ratlines the cook ran aft

  the skipper slowed down the engine as
the schooner drew up alongside the dory
ready hands hustled mel aboard the pela-
mon and captain dan hurried amidships
to ascertain what had happened mel was
limping supported on the stalwart arms of
crowe and pierre houde there was blood
around a rent in the right leg of his yellow
oilskin trousers

  got me in the leg explained mel to the
skipper gritting his teeth gamely tagged
me before i could git to the thwart

  take him below the skipper ordered
mels supporters mel-you hurt bad
not much i calclate replied the in-
jured man while crowe and pierre helped
him into the forecastle captain dan fol-
lowed them

        fortunately mels wound
although ugly was not fatal as
	wounds in the leg have frequently

          proved to fishermen whom sword-
fish have punched while mel lay on a
bunk the skipper treated the deep gash in
the calf muscles with iodine during which
mel did not even wince at the excruciating
pain the sword mel explained had pierced
the bottom of the dory diagonally ripping
through his oilskin trousers and inflicting a
glancing rather than a full blow if it had
hit his leg a full blow it would have torn it
to shreds

  the only danger is that the pizen on that
skippers off georges



sword may git into yer system captain
dan declared after he had patched up the
leg as best he could that means youll
stay in yer bunk for a spell and that well
clear right away for boston with what fish
weve got

  mels eyes widened clear for boston
he exclaimed why-you aint goin to
let a little thing like this upset yer plans are
ye skipper youll do nothin of the sort
we aint got half a trip yet

  weve got over a hundred said captain
dan not reprimanding mel for his insubor-
dinate words since mel had virtually been
commander on that trip how many
more dyou want

  as many as we can git in another weeks
fishin shot back mel i went with ye
to make ye high-liner skipper-an i wont
be satisfied till im sure ive done it

  captain dan half turned away from the
bunk a queer little smile wrinkling his
rather comical round face there was grit
for you a man injured by a swordfish-a
man who might have been killed outright-
refusing to be taken ashore

  im goin up on deck to take a look at
that punched dory the skipper told mel
then ill be back he did not mention
running into boston with their fish mel
lay back in his bunk and lighted his pipe
and captain dan went up the ladder

  the crew had hauled the body of the
swordfish on deck together with the dory
in the bottom of which the sword was so
firmly embedded that it could not be ex-
tricated handily it was a sword over four
feet in length and it was driven through the
woodwork clean to the gaping toothless
mouth of the fish mels escape from be-
ing speared through the abdomen had been
a narrow one indeed

  look shouted pierre pointing to port
captain dans eyes followed pierres point-
ing arm in the distance a good-sized
steam craft was approaching a little haze
rose from the smooth surface of the ground
swell through which the hulk of the single-
stacked oncoming craft showed less and less
distinctly as far as the eye could reach
dark blotches dotted the tranquil water
which marked the presence of vast schools of
small mackerel and herring

  but fog or no fog captain dan had seen
enough of that craft to know that the hurri-
cane had not upset captain iras fishing
plans and that he had ventured out even

if the main body of the swordfishing fleet
had not shown up in that locality

  the comber ejaculated captain dan
its bad enough to have the fog but

captain ira an the fog too an that-

ira in a blunderin trawler thats as danger-
ous as a liner in thick weather - these

waters are too small to hold us both git
up in the crosstrees boys to the crew
were goin to run to the norard

ill

         all that night the fog shroud-

         ed the waters of georges like a
reat liquid curtain on deck
ara not even the riding lights were
visible the constant drip-drip of water
from the rigging kept up monotonously the
deck ran rivulets as in a rain the watch
could not look through that solid mass of
demoniac vapor he was forced to content
himself with listening for the warning blasts
from onrushing steamships for the pelamon
lay directly in the route of eastbound
transatlantic shipping

  mel had made light of his injured leg
during the early part of the evening and in-
sisted on standing his watch with the others
of the crew mel seemed to be deeply
worried

  i calclate captain iras goin to require
watchin he told the skipper i dont
like the idee o bein in his neighborhood he
was so cut up bout me an my boys sailin
with you

  weve left him fur to the suthard
captain dan endeavored to quiet the in-
jured man an youll stand no watch
mel thats one order i wont take from
ye

  but captain dan stood his watch-and
his mind was on the comber intently he
listened for her weird shrill whistle all
around the pelamon sounded the warning
blasts of passing europe-bound steamers
most of them far away he listened to
each whistle trying to fathom the course of
the steamer so as to make sure that it was
not headed toward the pelamon

  one seemed to be headed in that direc-
tion twice it had whistled the second
blast sounding considerably closer than the
first then came the third oo-oo-ooh of
that lugubrious deep-throated voice to star-
board captain dan rushed to the bin-
nacle and turned on the small electric light


adventure

over the compass with his finger on the
compass card he waited anxiously to locate
its course by the fourth blast

  while he waited another whistle sounded
-this one between the schooner and the
oncoming steamer it was the piercing wail
of the comber

  oo-oo-ooh answered the steamer al-
most from the exact spot whence the comber
had whistled east by north-that was the
steamers course-straight toward the pela-
mon

  the skipper raced to the forecastle slide
which was open and shouted

  come on-quick big one cornin up
hurry up

  he dashed back to the wheel and started
the engine up from the forecastle scur-
ried the crew like rats their sea boots
drawn on mackinaws and jackets hastily
donned last of all came mel limping
after the others in their hurried flight aft

  keep yer eyes peeled an yer ears open
sang out captain dan holding the wheel and
squinting into the opaque fog to starboard
he steered south sure of the steamers east-
by-north course but trusting wholly to luck
that the invisible monster would whistle
again before she loomed up or traveled
safely past the pelamon

  pierre and ira held the little boxlike fog-
horn of the schooner on the deck house and
pumped out a penetrating little ya-a-a
anxiously all hands listened the oil-
burning engine of the schooner steadily
throbbed the only sound that punctuated
the ghostly silence

  --- that steamer-she aint whistlin
swore the skipper holding the wheel sta-
tionary his heart pounding in the dreadful

suspense she aint-

  off the bow close so close that they
could almost make out the vessel itself
echoed the shrill whistle of the comber
captain dan swung the wheel west and
from the direction in which the pelamon
was headed roared the oo-oo-ooh of the on-
rushing liner bearing straight down on the
schooner-a mass of crushing steel that
would wipe the pelamon from the face of
the deep if it crashed into the tiny craft

  pierre pumped a desperate appealing
blast from the foghorn a feeble wail for
help and mercy that seemed scarcely louder
than the twitter of mother careys chick-
ens fluttering around the riding lights the
skipper gave the wheel a slight twist bear-

ing straight toward the locality from which
the comber had last whistled

  the two apparitions of fast-moving
lights overtopped by rolling black smoke
burst out of the fog almost simultaneously
straight toward the pelamons bow raced
the comber and in a direct line toward the
starboard side of the struggling schooner
bore that arrow of silvery white water cut
by the huge steel prow of the ocean liner

  not a man of the crew moved a fraction
of an inch from his position aft although
they knew as did the skipper that death
was closing its two hands upon them the
liner did not sheer-it was traveling so fast
that it could not have sheered without
throwing its passengers out of their beds

  but the comber sheered and sheered so
abruptly that her swinging stern almost
sideswiped the pelamon the schooners
bowsprit grazed the trawler which was in
no less danger from the blind course of the
liner than was the frail pdamon and cap-
tain ira was bringing his craft about under
full steam

  it was probably captain iras maneuver
which saved the pelamon from being listed
among those new england fishing craft
which have been blotted mysteriously out
of existence for the schooner had no
sooner plunged into the great wave which
the fleeing trawler had left astern than the
illuminated portholes and dimly lighted
decks of the liner churned past to star-
board so close that for a few terrible
seconds it seemed as if the pelamon must
be swept under that massive keel by its
great suction

  but as on many another occasion when
the pelamons existence had been threatened
by collision with a liner which violates all
rules of navigation on the fishing banks the
staunch little schooner bobbed up and down
like a bucking horse wallowed from side to
side with her lee rail under most of the
time and slowly steadied herself while
with diminishing blasts of their whistles
the comber and the hair-brain-skippered
steamer kept up their grim game of hide
and seek

  -- them liners-an trawlers too
fumed captain dan after he had shut off
the pelamons engine and he and the excit-
ed crew were recounting the details of the
narrow escape they had just had it
dont do us no good to swear about em-
but- em
skippers off georges



        iv

after his close shave the night
before captain dan was more
determined than ever to heave
to and head for boston with his
swordfish breakfast that morning had
been a cheerless affair for the crew were
restless and grouchy implying by their
behavior that they were tiring of the trip
and would welcome the skippers decision
to knock off fishing for the season on
deck the fog was still thick and it would be
difficult to sight a swordfish from the mast-
head

  boys stated the skipper after break-
fast well knock off today weve got a

good trip o fish an-

  we aint got as many as i want pro-
tested mel adjusting the bandage on his
leg as he rose from the triangular forecastle
table an not as many as my boys want
-have ye fellers he addressed the crew
he had lent captain dan for the summer

  suits me-this trip does answered
crowe and the others seconded crowes
opinion

  mel lighted his pipe boys he said
where theres mackrel theys swordfish
the waters alive with bait by goin in
now were throwin away good american
dollars-the kind thatll buy our folks a
good eal back home in novy scoshy an

besides wed be-cowards to be bound

in now

  how you make that out mel indig-
nantly asked captain dan

  just this replied mel ira thomas is
in these waters-an he knows were here
an with him is that - wuthless crew
skipper that kep you from bein high-liner
it wont be becomin for us to go in before
weve got a full trip itll look like were
runnin away from him an we would be
too is they any one here whos scared o
ira thomas an his tribe o cutthroats

  - no whod be scared o them

id fight any two of em retorted mels
weatherbeaten shipmates

  see skipper exulted mel i came
out here to make ye high-liner didnt i
wal i haint goin to give up till ive done
it an that means that when the order
comes to start for boston ill give it
captain dans cheeks flushed his eyes
widened and he gasped speechless at this
unexpected mutiny of his benefactor he

gradually got his breath after considerable
puffing and shot back

 why-mel - yer hide mel you

presumtious scut mel youre-

  aint i right skipper asked mel with
a tranquil smile

  right course youre right retracted
capn dan chuckling while his plump body
shook convulsively if you want to have
a swordfish punch ye agin go ahead an let
him well stay out a spell longer

  he went up the ladder followed by mel
and the placated laughing crew the keen
eyes of shiny and the other men in the mast-
head had made out swordfish on days that
had been just as foggy as this shinys
vision in thick weather was positively un-
canny mel often boasted that the suc-
cess of the victory the past two seasons had
been due to shinys almost superhuman
ability to sight swordfish on days when
most skippers of the fleet knocked off fishing
altogether

  so the skipper started the engine and the
men took their seats in the crosstrees
mel hobbled out to the pulpit where he sat
in the little seat slung from the hand rail
leaning on the pole and scanning the fog-
shrouded water while the schooner plunged
ahead

  they had ranged thus for over an hour
mel had ironed two swordfish which were
successfully hauled and killed in dories by
crowe and pierre pierre had just been
taken aboard the schooner with the second
fish when shiny sang out from the mast-
head

  starbard starbard harda-starbard
captain dan quickly let out the engine
to get steerageway thinking that another
swordfish had been sighted a swish of
steam to port-and out of the fog burst
the prow of a large ship

  the comber shrieked shiny hard
a-starbard

  but captain dan swung the wheel to port
it was a safe bet to dodge liners by heading
to one side of them but the comber was
not to be dealt with that way dan had
had one experience with captain ira and
his son oliver in a matter of collision and
he did not trust ira if he was in command
of the comber as usual to avoid a second
such catastrophe for since his court vic-
tory over captain dan the skipper of the
comber was not too scrupulous to try it
again


adventure

  so rather than lead captain ira on a
chase-which would prove to be disastrous
in the end if ira were really bent on running
him down-captain dan held the nose of
the pelamon straight toward the trawlers
bow mel hastily limped to the fore deck
from the pulpit and the men in the mast-
head taking no chances on being caught
aloft if the two vessels collided descended
the ratlines like monkeys

  but before they had reached the deck
the pelamon had swung off to starboard of
the comber and the trawler churned past
missing the schooner by a wide margin
captain ira taking no chances on bringing
his craft about abruptly as he had done the
previous night to save her from the liner
and when the trawler had been swallowed
astern by the fog captain dan shut off the
engine

  good lord christopher ejaculated mel
sitting on the deck house and eying the
skipper admiringly when it comes to
quick thinkin-youre there

 captain dan motioned for mel to be
quiet he listened until the throbbing of
the combers engines died away in the dis-
tance then he opened up the engine

  all right boys captain dan sang out
well keep on fishin now and to mel
i see captain iras game now hes plan-
nin to run us down the -- whelp

  he wont-not while youve got your
eyes open like you just proved you have
mel commended the skipper he slouched
forward without another word and took his
place in the pulpit

  captain dan was surprized at the tone of
disappointment in mels remarks could
it be that mel was disappointed because
the comber had failed in what appeared to
be the deliberate attempt of captain ira
to run down the schooner to all appear-
ances mel had been dans friend who had
sacrificed his seasons fishing to put the
veteran on his feet financially but mel
had also been friendly with captain ira
before the pelamon sailed that summer
and for mel to show disappointment-

  good heavens could it be that mel
was in with captain ira on this that the
whole summers fishing had been a part
of iras plot to run captain dan off the
water captain ira was well-to-do he
could easily afford to make mels treachery
to dan an object financially and it had
not been likely that mel had given up his

summers fishing in the victory to put dan
on his feet

  dan cursed himself for not thinking of that
before he knew captain iras methods
why had dan been so gullible at mels pro-
fession of friendship now it looked very
much to dan as if ira had bribed mel
to assure dan a successful fishing season
then planned to sink the pelamon on her
last trip rescuing her crew handily they
to swear subsequently in court that it had
resulted from an unavoidable accident
that was what mel and ira had planned
when they got together before swordfishing
season

  and mels eagerness for captain dan to
keep on fishing proved that mel had a hid-
den motive in prolonging the trip and
luke carey of mels crew was on the
comber--

  dan felt strangely sad and alone there
he was an old man practically at the mercy
of captain ira and mel for now he was
sure that mel was iras confederate dan
knew he wasnt such a good fisherman as
he used to be but he loved the thrill of
swordfishing even its countless dangers
this was his pay for an honest life for his
kindness to mel when mel needed a friend
how could mel enter such a conspiracy with
captain ira against the best friend he had
in the states

  captain dan quickly made up his mind
he would head for boston at once if the
comber chased him he could give her a
merry race and possibly he could lose her
in the fog allhough captain ira like most
swordfishing skippers had an uncanny
knack of locating vessels in thick weather
he would--

derelic ahead shiny
shouted from the masthead
port captain dan swung the
wheel to port past the star-
board side of the pelamon drifted a half-
submerged hull dismasted its deck was
awash its stern completely out of sight its
bow riding high and clear of the surface
it was evident that it was the wreck of a
lumber schooner for only a cargo of lum-
ber would permit the derelict to float in
that position the light cargo held up the
bow the heavier stern following the law of
gravitation and settling underwater at an
angle of forty-five degrees or more

  captain dan looked for her name but it
skippers off georges



was obliterated from the hapless vessels
bleached bows the derelict was the worst
kind of menace to navigation for it was
floating directly in the eastbound transat-
lantic shipping route the revenue cutter
massasoit was to the northward with the
swordfishing fleet it should be reported
to her

  how about salvagin her skipper
asked bill alden who had come up on deck
at the mastheaders outcry looks like a
good bit o lumber shes got in her

  we will not replied the skipper
watching the derelict while the pelamon
left it astern were headed for boston
now an the sooner we git there the better
-for me he added significantly

  for you exploded bill lord sakes
-it looks like itd be better for all of us-
with ira thomas aimin to run us down
captain dan was half disposed to ques-
tion bill on mels relations with captain ira
bill was an honest reliable fellow-at least
he appeared to be that was the --- of
it-mel and his whole crew appeared to be

honest enough but-

  shes comin-the comber starbard
hard over there skipper

  at shinys excited warning captain dan
twisted the wheel hard a-starboard and
peered into the fog to port out of the
thickness loomed that menacing prow again
the trawlers engines thrummed and steam
hissed the apparition bearing straight to-
ward the schooners quarter

  this time the skipper had no alternative
but to cut a circle to starboard depending
on the ability of the smaller vessel to be
brought about faster than the cumbersome
steam craft no doubt the trawler could
travel faster in a race but captain dans
plan was to run before the comber then
execute a quick turn and scurry out of the
steam crafts path as he had so often dodged
out of the course of oncoming ocean liners

  so the pelamon raced ahead of the pur-
suing comber as a small bird wildly attempts
to outfly a hungry hawk closer loomed
the menacing prow the trawler was gain-
ing the engine of the schooner wide open
as it was could not outdistance the greater
power of the steam craft

  captain dan gauged the diminishing dis-
tance between them now was the time
abruptly he swung the wheel intently
watching the dead-ahead course of the
comber astern as he did so

  another hand grasped the wheel cap-
tain dan whirled facing mel

  skipper - dont do it panted the
striker his hands tightening on the spokes
of the helm keep on ahead-they cant
catch us steer for the---

  --- your soul screamed the skipper
relinquishing his hold on the wheel and
striking at mel in his insane fury youve

overplayed your game you bluenose-

youve-

  the worst enemy youve got is chasin
you skipper shot back mel wrenching
the wheel and holding the pelamon on a
straight course let me take the wheel
im in command o this schooner it aint
mutiny you made me skipper after the
hurricane-an ive got the crew to back
up my evidence

  captain dan disregarding the comber
which was fairly swooping down on the
schooner looked at mel with open-mouthed
amazement too well he realized his folly
in putting mel virtually in command dur-
ing his unguarded moments of great en-
thusiasm for the man who had appeared
to be his benefactor mel was right it
was not mutiny mel had received com-
mand from him ike crowe would sub-
stantiate it

  but law or no law captain dan was not
going to see his schooner blotted out of
existence before his very eyes and with him
aboard her he let go of the wheel and tore
into mel with both fists flying

  but although he battered mels face with
blows that would have stunned any ordi-
nary man the striker hung on to the wheel
and twisted it slowly to port putting what
little wind there was on the schooners
quarter the crew who had come down
from their precarious perches aloft in case
the pelamon were run down pounced upon
the fiery skipper and he sprawled on deck
under them they were not obeying dan
they obeyed mel whom dan had previous-
ly put in command

  let him up shouted mel but see
that he keeps quiet an some o you keep
a lookout for that derelic i think ive
got its position about right but i aint
sure

  captain dan was hauled to his feet bill
alden and pierre gripping his shoulders
and holding his tense arms he looked
astern to his surprise the comber had
lost distance the wake of the pelamon


adventure

proved that mel was circling to port racing
ahead of the trawler back toward where
they had first sighted her just after they had
passed the derelict

  resignedly the skipper watched the race
too well he could fathom mels diabolic
plan now collision with the derelict
would sink the schooner without involving
the comber if he tried to make out in
court that the comber had pursued the
pelamon he would be laughed down

  now the comber previously balked bv
mels change of course was gaining again
captain dan wondered what would happen
at the rescue after the collision-whether
captain ira would even bother about rescu-
ing him would he-

  there the derelic is-hard a-port
shouted shiny from the position he had
taken for lookout halfway up the foremast
port ratlines mel got the helm over
captain dan edged with his captors toward
the port rail so that he could see all that
happened

  head for her stern-her stern yelled
mel at shiny and shiny replied loudly-

  steady youre headin straight for it

  now captain dan could make out the
dark spot a-bow that marked the derelict
he glanced astern the trawler was within
her own length of the pelamons quarter
and gaining-gaining--

  hard a-port hard a-port screamed
shiny

  but mel had kept the derelict under ob-
servation since shiny had sighted it he
was steering without paying attention to
shinys commands captain dans glance
shot to the derelict now lying directly un-
der the pelamons bowsprit

  mel gave the wheel an abrupt twist-
so sudden that the schooner heeled over and
her starboard rail was within a foot of
being awash water swept that side of
the deck a scraping sound rose from
under her keel she stopped abruptly-
but only for a second then steadying
herself  she left the derelict astern and sped
on a straight course on even keel

  good lord christopher exclaimed the
skipper staring at mel in admiration
that was the handsomest bit o maneu-
verin i ever see on salt water that
was--

  captain dan heard the crash of wood
the sudden escaping of steam astern so
rapt had he been after mels skilful pas-

sage over the stern of the derelict that he
had quite forgotten the comber like the
others grouped aft he stared into the fog
and mel slowing down the engine brought
the schooner about in a slow circle

  those breathless fishermen of the pela-
mon could not make out exactly what had
happened owing to the thickness but well
enough they could imagine the comber
had run slam bang on to the derelict and
the force of such a collision must have
punched a good-sized hole in her bottom
a long blast from the combers wailing
whistle confirmed their suspicions

  shes struck shouted mel in a cold
emotionless voice stand by all hands

we cant see them poor--

  to - with em barked bill alden

theyre gittin a dose o what theyd
planned for us

  and as the pelamon hove in sight of the
comber it was evident that the trawler
was in a bad fix her whistle still wailing
hideously the steam crafts splintered bow
told the story of water that was flooding
her below decks faster than it could be
pumped out she had struck hard with
such force that although the contact had
been below her water line it had demolished
the woodwork at that point almost to the
deck itself shattering the hull as if the
trawler had collided with a vessel its own
size or larger

  take luke carey off mel an to -

with the rest of em pleaded bill
theyve--

  need any help shouted mel through
cupped hands there was no answer from
the comber all hands aboard her were
working too industriously to heed the
proximity of the schooner

 my - exclaimed pierre she

leak like wan lobster pot lookit her list
she-

y there was a sudden movement
v aboard the trawler men rushed
up   ei deck and started to
 get dories overside her super-
structure swayed tilted abruptly a tremor
shook her followed by a big puff of smoke
that rolled thickly from every part of her
hull and hung over the damaged ship like
an evil black spirit its widening borders
absorbed by the encompassing fog mel
opened the engine and backed the pelamon
away from the comber
skippers off georges



  her boilers burst out captain dan
theyve exploded

  the words were no sooner out of his
mouth than the comber lurched dizzily
from side to side her bow settled like
that of a diving submarine two dories
were slid into the water but the deck of
the trawler hove up with a sudden rocking
motion and the dories were crushed under
the combers careening side before the men
could jump into them

  with a hissing sound the bow plunged
deeper into the sea men jumped clinging
to whatever loose woodwork they could
grab the stern of the comber lifted higher
and higher until its big propeller was en-
tirely exposed

  and with a whistling noise scarcely less
piercing than the strident prolonged blast
of its now silent wail of distress had been
in a great gulf of swirling white water the
trawler dived to the ocean depths the
rosette of green and white drew together
over the vanished propeller like the mouth
of a closed purse swallowing the comber
forever

  while the crew of the pelamon stood
spellbound at the frightful sight mel
swung the schooner toward the spot where
the comber had gone down a big section
of wooden wreckage floated past

  git busy boys he barked waking
them from their trance

  but captain dan already had a boat
hook in his hands and stood at the port
rail pierre and bill alden were launching
a dory as were ike crowe and shiny
the heads of men bobbed in the water
dan got his boat hook into the clothing of
one fellow and dragged him over the rail-
a badly frightened man of small stature
but uninjured

  hlo cale captain dan greeted the
rescued man recognizing him as cale smith
of his old crew

  but cale merely gave him a surly look
and made himself useful assisting other
men in the water on to the deck of the
pelamon all four dories of the pelamon
were now out into which men were fished
on all sides of the schooner for they
experienced deep-water men all had clung
doggedly to whatever floating material they
had grasped knowing that however deep
the suction of the sinking trawler drew them
they would eventually bob back to the sur-
face and most of them had leaped overside

from the stern thereby avoiding the suction
or being only partly drawn into it

  i calclate everbody got away anx-
iously declared cale to captain dan
cause we had to abandon the engine
room before the explosion water filled ei
up so fast

  the growing number of men on deck who
were either hauled aboard by dan and
other rescued men or brought in from the
dories seemed to confirm cales belief
mel watched anxiously while the dories
brought in their loads studying the faces
of all the rescued men and when the last
dory came in containing captain ira and
luke carey mels square face brightened

  call the roll captain thomas mel
shouted at the skipper of the comber cap-
tain ira was a tall thin somewhat stoop-
shouldered seafarer in the early sixties
his black eyes and iron-gray hair and mus-
tache lending to his hook-nosed hatchet
face the evil aspect of a malign bird of prey

  captain ira lined up his men and called
off their names without loss of time twen-
ty-six answered him

  all here he announced to mel disre-
garding captain dan entirely he seemed
calm enough even bold in the face of
the disaster to his prized trawler a wicked
grin wrinkled the tight leathery skin of his
sinister countenance

  i calclate under the circumstances mel
my men can handle the navigatin o this
schooner an give yourn a rest

  while captain ira was talking mel had
picked up a spare harpoon pole from the
deckhouse

  i calclate your offer aint exacly be-
cornin the striker answered the skipper
of the ill-fated comber in the fust place
i aint the man to be addressed on such a
matter bein as capn oldham is still skip-
per here then agin while you an your
bullies are aboard the pelamon your
quarters will be in the focsle till we can
git ye into port luke he addressed his
former shipmate who was lined up amid-
ships with the combers crew step out
here

  aye aye sir replied luke smilingly
in the most approved maritime etiquette
advancing toward mel

  now tell what ye know mel calmly
ordered luke

  id rather wait an tell it in court
replied luke all i can say mel is that


adventure

ive got about fifty diffrent kinds o evi-
dence that capn ira tried to run the
pelamon down your plan to have me
ship with capn ira to git that evidence

worked too-well

  captain ira advanced toward mel with
fists doubled up murder in his evil eyes

  so that was your scheme in havin
luke sign on with me eh he snarled
well mel thats a game that two can
play at boys he shouted at his crew
take over this ship well man her an
settle with this bunch o bullies later

  the men huddled amidships let out a
concerted whoop and started to carry out
captain iras orders but suddenly the
yell was cut off and in its place rose a howl
of mortal agony for a yellow shaft shot
through the air striking sid barnetts left
thigh and sid crumpled up on deck with
lightning speed mel pulled back the pole
by its bib line and clapped another lily
iron on its tip from the supply of metal
harpoons lying on the deck house

  the crew of the pelamon flew about in
lively fashion grabbing gaffs harpoon poles
and knives led by mel they advanced
on the twenty-seven fishermen rescued from
the comber

  my leg my leg -he ironed me

wailed sid groveling on deck abandoned
by his erstwhile shipmates as they retreated
for mels exhibition of accuracy with the
harpoon which was still embedded in sids
thigh had convinced them conclusively
of what damage the star striker of the en-
tire fleet could inflict on them despite his
lameness and luke carey held an auto-
matic pistol its muzzle menacing his late
shipmates of the comber

  im here to shoot-an shoot to kill
t calmly declared luke
s into the focsle with ye shouted mel
hobbling in the lead of his shipmates

  headlong the irresolute men of the
comber plunged one after the other into
the forecastle mel slammed the slide shut
after them

  all right skipper mel shouted at
dan who stood with the others of the
pelamons complement a short-handled
gaff gripped in his hand his eyes full of
fight take the wheel steer back to the
wreckage o the derelic

  captain dan taking the wheel steered
for a large section of the derelict which
floated in the midst of a sea of drifting

lumber and bits of wreckage and as they
approached it the large floating section
resolved itself into the square stern of the
derelict which had been left practically
intact after the comber demolished the rest
of the wreck

  a siren whistle wailed to starboard

  the cutter shouted luke pointing in
that direction the fog was clearing away 
the sun bursting through it in reddish radi-
ance two miles or more away a rakish
gray craft steamed toward the pelamon

  shes answerin the radio call for help
that capn ira sent out when the comber
struck explained luke

  captain dan recognized the cutter-the
coastguard greyhound massasoit which fol-
lows the fishing fleet to administer to in-
jured and sick fishermen and in the
distance twinkled the sails of half a dozen
schooners the main body of the georges
swordfishing fleet was ranging southward

v

          the transfer of captain ira and
his men to the massasoit had been
effected only after lengthy expla-
nations by captain dan luke
and mel probably lukes displaying of
papers which preserved in a waterproof
pocket proved that he was to be commis-
sioned a water policeman on a boston police
boat at the close of the fishing season had
some weight toward influencing commander
wilkes of the cutter but commander
wilkes was a friend of dan and mel and
like many other seafaring men he was well
aware that the court award after the col-
lision the previous year had been eminently
unjust

  a hard but kindly seaman wilkes sym-
pathized with swordfishermen because he
knew what risks they run to make an honest
living so he summed up the arguments
pro and con and decided that it was not
only his duty to take the combers crew
ashore but to arrest her commander as a vio-
lator of international law on the high seas

  after the cutter had steamed away
with its prisoners luke gleefully observed

  youve got all the cards in your hands
capn oldham that crew o capn iras
didnt fight us because theyll turn agin
ira in a minute-aint loyal to him no more
than they was to you they told me them-
selves on the comber theyd turn states
skippers off georges



evidence if capn ira was ketched in any
of his tricks you can crush capn ira
like-

  i dont want to crush him answered
captain dan hes lost the comber thats
punishment enough

  it aint enough put in mel hobbling
aft because that derelic was capn
iras vessel too

  what-the eva thomas asked dan
but mel was assisting ike crowe in launch-
ing a dory they held back the small boat
while captain dan brought the schooner up
to the large floating section of the derelict
the collision had evidently broken the dere-
lict into several sections most of which the
buoyant lumber released and now floating
on the surface had gone to the bottom ap-
parently there was enough lumber impris-
oned in the after hold to buoy up the stern
after the comber had by its impact demol-
ished the rest of the derelict or perhaps the
stern was light enough to float when it had
been divested of the rest of the weight aft

 my - exclaimed shiny standing

with a horrified expression on his face at the
port rail theres a drownded man on it
i sighted him underwater when the
pelamon passed over the derelic com-
mented mel an later after the comberd
cut the derelic in two

  captain dan slowed down the engine
mel and ike launched the dory the men
on the schooner watched mel and ike cut
loose a human body lashed to the wheel
of the derelict

  and while they hoisted that inert form
on deck tears came to captain dans eyes
as he recognized the distorted features of
the dead man

  oliver thomas he choked while his
shipmates eyed him astonished at his
emotion-he who looked upon the corpse
of a vanquished enemy

  look skipper sang out mel as he
climbed over the port rail and designated
with a head jerk the bobbing stern of the
derelict

  captain dan glanced up from the dead
man his eyes widened for as the ground
swell swayed the mass of wreckage and

played over it he caught the lettering on
the stern of what had once been a proud
ship and he read-

victory

  great caesars ghost he exclaimed
then it want the eva thomas an mel
-you did sell capn ira your schooner
sure did replied mel smiling the
eva was so unsea worthy after she rammed
the pelamon that ira had to git a new
schooner for oliver so i let him have the
victory-at a fancy price i reconized
her durin the hurricane

  why mel-are you crazy you-high-
liner-with no vessel o your own
sure replied mel to git rid o
the responsibility o bein skipper i kep
the sale o the victory a secret from my
crew sos they wouldnt up an sign with
some other skipper i wanted that crew
o mine not only to make ye high-liner
but like me to larn to admire your sea-
manship-your kindness -your--

  but that aint gittin you a ship for
them to fish in protested captain dan
you aint got a vessel

  but you have quickly replied mel
while his crew looked on an you need
a crew-a crew that swore to me while the
massasoit was shippin capn ira an his
gang that theyd rather sail with you than
any skipper of the fleet-an that theyll
side with you if you want to prosecute me
for mutiny but if youll ship a mutineer

an his old crew-permanent-

  id ship the-himself if his name was

mel frost vowed captain dan gripping
mels wide shoulders in undiluted ecstasy
an i refuse to take command till that
mutineer has fetched the pelamon into
boston thats my prosecution mel
then hist the mainsl take the wheel
skipper shouted mel weve been high-
liners for nigh a week but i wanted to stay
on the banks till luke had a good chance
to git his evidence now hes got it were
bound to boston

  captain dan let out the engine and
twisted the wheel the compass turned
to north

author of the dog without a tail  the last match etc

         ll i got agen him hes treach-
            erous

             cock-eye leary spat to-
bacco juice in the snow and
twitched his eyebrows at shorty hunt
then he corrected himself

  no not so much that neither-hes in-
dependent as a hog on ice cant get
fresh with him outpull any dog in the
country he will never tired nor lazy an
dont know what sore feet is never need
put moccasins on him wouldnt want to
try have a feller eat up an nothin left
but a wishbone an a pair moccasins thats
king

  i wouldnt let on before but bein as
youve bought him itd be only right to
warn you you let king pull an keep off
him with the whip an let him do what he
wants when he aint in harness and hes

your dog till - freezes but it aint

no use neither to bulldoze ner try an be
friends thats what i dont like about

him-hes so-independent

  shorty hunt listened and smiled and
nodded but said nothing while kings
late owner continued to ramble on about
things in general and the big black husky
in particular

  the five dogs three black and two brown
lay in a string on the snow harnessed to
shortys new carriole they were a fine-

looking team and the little man felt proud
of his purchase but king was the jewel
of them all a smouldering fire gleamed
in his yellow eyes and there was invincible
pride in the lift of his massive head

  see said cock-eye and addressed the
dog in hectoring tones you king you
lazy mangy fleabit houn dawg you

  up came kings defiant head the point of
an ivory fang gleaming under a wrinkled
lip and the stiff bristles on his back rising

  get it said leary turning back to
shorty three more words to him and hed
have my liver out here on the snow

  shortys merry blue eyes twinkled and
he laughed

  sure looks as if he was all fixed to do it
he agreed

  well there you are keep your eye on
king an dont try an get gay with him an
youll be all right start any shenanigans
an you or hims goin to be left on the trail
for the wolves to eat thats all i got to
say well good luck to you

  so long answered shorty and whistled
to the dogs mush there mush he
cried

  king was on his feet body braced for the
starting pull the jerk that wrenches the
runners loose almost before the words were
out of his mouth the well-trained team
were hardly less quick and in a second they


king the husky



were away at the quick short trot that eats
up the long miles fifty sixty seventy a
day shorty his long whip hanging from
his wrist and trailing behind him on the
snow settled down to the steady jog be-
tween a walk and a run of the old dog
runner

 though he was new in that part of the
country he had driven dogs for years in
the yukon and mckenzie basins and he
thought that what he did not know about
sleigh dogs was not worth knowing he
had no doubt that by a judicious mixture
of firmness and kindness he would soon
bring king into willing subjection and
he was all the more desirous of bringing it
about in that already his heart warmed to
the peerless brute

  it was not long before the rest of the
team adored him he treated them with
justice kindness and firmness in the right
proportions it was seldom indeed that
he swung his whip but when he did the long
lash bit like a snake he knew when a dog
was tired and when he was merely shirking
he had an eagle eye for sore feet that bane
of the sleigh dog

 after a thaw when the temperature
falls again every wrinkle in the snow be-
comes a knifeblade of ice and dogs with
tender feet suffer cruelly but none of
shortys team ever had to limp along
leaving bloody footprints on the trail he
was prepared with little buckskin moccasins
and every cut had prompt attention

 but they were never needed for king
he seemed to have feet of iron the hard-
est days mushing over glare ice or through
heavy new-fallen snow found him still with
head and tail up pulling for every pound
that was in him

 between him and shorty there grew up
a curious relationship it was hardly that
of master and servant more that of two
equals with little affection but great mutual
respect between them engaged of necessity
in a common task it was shortys place to
choose the trail decide the load the time
and place of camping and to allot the ra-
tions it was kings place to pull the
hardest set the pace and keep order among
his mates and he did all these things
superlatively well

  the other dogs held him in deepest awe
they fought amongst themselves as sleigh
dogs will when their masters eye is not
upon them but they left king alone

the merest wrinkling of his lip was enough
to appal the boldest he did not even
condescend to associate with them nor did
he stoop to curry favor with his master
in solitary grandeur eating by himself
and sleeping by himself he dwelt apart

  the coldest night drew him no closer to
his mates and there were some terrible
nights nights when the ice on the lakes
boomed and screamed in long rippling
fearsome noises in the rending grip of the
frost when the air stung and prickled in
the nostrils when nothing moved but the
ever restless dancers of the north sweeping
fantastically across the vault of heaven
in waves of lambent green and purple and
crimson through it all king held himself
aloof the rime glistening on his back and
his brooding eyes gleaming out under ice-
encrusted brows

  shorty often wondered what went on in
the mind behind those eyes his own
feelings were mixed he felt he could love
king as he had never loved any dog and
dogs were his passion as some men love
women others power others beauty he
loved dogs but it was hard to love king
at times he felt exasperation at his inability
to penetrate the brutes iron reserve but in
the main he felt only admiration and re-
spect tinctured with some of the awe in
which the team hed their grim leader

  it was a hard winter a winter of intense
cold but little snow moreover the mys-
terious plague that periodically smites the
snowshoe rabbits of the north had been
busy and all the flesh eaters of the wild
were hungry in consequence

  in a days march one would hardly cross
a dozen of the fan-shaped tracks and that
of course meant danger from timber wolves
doubly so because of the light fall of snow
that enabled the moose and deer to outrun
them they were reduced to hunting un-
der the snow for mice and wolves are not
so well fitted for that kind of hunting as the
smaller carnivora

        shorty noted as the winter
  drew on that they were forming
into unusually large packs they
also took to haunting the freight
trails on the lookout for scraps left at de-
serted camps and that is always a danger-
ous sign the fact caused the little man
small anxiety at first for though the in-
dians hold timber wolves in deep respect


adventure

few of the white men of the north have
anything but contempt for them it is
seldom indeed that a man is in any real
danger from wolves unless he happens to
fall sick or be injured on the trail

  but even shorty at last began to feel
uneasy a big pack was undoubtedly fol-
lowing him and his dogs all but king were
growing restless and frightened they
drew close to the fire at night and seemed
subdued they stopped wrangling among
themselves and were perpetually rising to
stare into the darkness

  when the fire burnt low shorty would be
roused by a series of whines and snarls
which would not subside until he rose and
threw fresh fuel on the blaze then he
would see paired greenish lights moving
eerily on the edge of the darkness and some-
thing like a shudder would go through him
in spite of all his sturdy courage and
scepticism

  but king curled in a tight ball even in the
snow yards farther from the fire than any
of the rest never even deigned to lift his
scornful head looking at him shorty
would feel comforted and return to his
blankets if king was not frightened
why should he be

  the wolves were often to be seen even in the
daytime in twos and threes generally at a
considerable distance but often on both
sides of the trail as well as before and be-
hind it was not easy to estimate the size
of the pack but there was no doubt that he
moved in the midst of a little army of gaunt
and starving brutes who were only awaiting
a favorable opportunity or until their hun-
ger overcame their fears to attack

  but he held stubbornly on his way de-
termined not to anticipate trouble until the
time came to meet it he was strongly
tempted to take a shot at a wolf now and
then but ammunition is precious stuff in
the north and the brutes were wary only
to be momentarily glimpsed close at hand
and never in the open except at long
ranges

  he reached the post in safety and dropped
his load and with nothing but his own
gear and food for the dogs headed south-
eastward over an unbroken trail to where a
load was awaiting him at another post
his way led him through a different and
more dangerous country for whereas the
up trail ran mainly across open lakes where
the wolves would hesitate to attack him

  his new route took him across some rocky
uplands sparsely forested with stunted
spruce which provided good cover for his

enemies

  all went well for two days for though
he had abundant evidence that the wolves
were still close at hand they made no
hostile demonstration it was a dreary land
that he entered upon on the third day high-
lying and bleak

  jagged masses of granite thrust up
through the snow their tops swept bare by
the wind the thin soil afforded only a
precarious foothold for an occasional
dwarfed and twisted spruce but in the hol-
lows grew thick clumps of willow blood red
against the snow the terrain was much
broken by abrupt hills and gullies and the
visibility was consequently bad it was
never possible to see more than a couple of
hundred yards in any direction and the
willow scrub made ideal cover for his lurking
foes

  shorty noticed that his dogs were even
more restless and uneasy than usual and
even king began to show signs of disquie-
tude the heavy fell on his shoulders
bristled and his great fangs were bared at
short intervals as he lifted his head and
caught the wolf taint on the air

  it was a dull cloudy day with an occa-
sional snowflake drifting down the raw east
wind the temperature about zero at
noon shorty decided to camp it had been
been hard going all morning even with the
half empty carriole over the unbroken trail
with its knife-edged drifts and across
patches of bare windswept rock and the
dogs were beginning to show signs of sore
feet

  he halted in the lee of a little clump of
spruce almost at once he became aware
that he was surrounded by wolves the
willows around him were alive with move-
ments and gaunt fierce heads were lifted
from behind every granite outcrop he
had a sudden feeling that the long-threat-
ened attack was about to take place

  well - it he muttered with an

angry grin if they are goin to start some-
thing maybe id best let em an get it over

with but somebodys goin to catch-

if they do

  he slipped the harness swiftly off the
dogs and they promptly crowded round him
every back bristling and every fang bared
shorty caught up his rifle thought better of
king the husky



  it and exchanged it for his axe as a better
and more dangerous weapon at close
quarters

  then the wolves were upon them they
came silently but with terrible swiftness
falling as if out of the air how many there
were shorty never was able to tell but
there seemed hundreds to his excited vision

  with his back to a tree his axe gripped
firmly in both hands and his dogs in a circle
round him he met them the battle was
joined on the air rose a bedlam of snarls
yelps howls and a ghastly worrying noise
shorty hewed and slashed madly in the
midst of a mass of leaping raving gray
demons there were wolves everywhere
his dogs were buried under them gnashing
teeth menaced him on every side

  a big wolf leaped full at his throat he
met it with a slash that split its skull in
two halfs and pivoted on his heel to sink
his axe to the eye in the shoulder of another

  a wolf sprang at him from the side and
bore him to his knees only the collar of
his heavy sheepskin jacket saved him from
having his jugular torn out another wolf
caught him by the shoulder he thrust
the handle of his axe between the open jaws
of a third a fourth landed upon his back

  he felt that his end had come in his
extremity he lifted up his voice and called
upon the one dog he felt could aid him

  king o king he cried

 and king heard and came though
locked in a death grapple with a dozen
wolves by some miracle of strength and
agility he wrenched himself free and sprang
upon shortys chief assailant who had him
pinned by the neck from behind

  shorty struggled to his feet he was
blood-mad yvithout attempting to de-
fend himself without any thought but to
kill and kill until he was killed himself he
flung himself into the fray hacking kicking
cursing panting blinded with blood and
sweat and fear and hatred and fury until
upon a sudden he found none to oppose him
the attack had melted away as swiftly
and as silently as it had come

shorty sank down dizzily
breathing in sobbing gasps and
gazed with woeful eyes on a
scene of utter disaster on the
trampled and bloodstained snow lay a
dozen dead or dying wolves and the mangled
bodies of four of his own dogs king only

survived but he was in a piteous plight
he was covered with blood one of his ears
bitten off close to his head and he lay
weakly licking at a gaping wound in his
shoulder

  shorty himself looked like a butcher in
a shambles the axe he still grasped was
thick with matted blood and hair and he
himself was splashed with crimson from
moccasin to cap his shoulders and the
back of his neck ached from a dozen bites
and the calf of his right leg had been ripped
open for three inches or more by a slashing
bite from a dying wolf of his late assail-
ants however nothing was to be seen
though a network of tracks many splashed
with red led away in every direction

  well king old scout reckon were up
against it

  king slowly lifted his head and stared at
him there was no sign of weakness or
softening in those flaming eyes he had
come to his owners assistance when called
upon not it appeared from any affection
but from noblesse oblige had the spirit of
the haughtiest of the seigneurs of ancient
france been re-incarnated in a dog this
black husky of the north were the fittest
receptacle

  shorty was no match for him in aristo-
cratic and unbending pride but he was of
sound if plebeian stock through and
through it was not in his nature to give
up though every movement was an agony
he soon had a good fire going and made
shift to dress his wounds his back and
shoulders he could do little for but though
painfully lacerated the bites there did not
seem deep his leg was another matter
but he bound it up with a spare shirt he had
in his pack

  he would have tended kings hurts too
but that the dog would not permit he
did not whine or flinch or snap but he
took shortys hand gently but firmly in his
great jaws and held it fast growling warn-
ingly deep in his throat

  all right you old crank agreed shorty
in affectionate exasperation go ahead
and lick it maybe you know best anyway

  after he had eaten and rested the little
man considered it time to be moving
there was not the least hope in the world of
anybody passing there probably was
not a human being within fifty miles and
the barren upland where he was lay far out
of the usual travel routes
i

adventure

  he knew the post lay somewhere to the
southeastward between forty and sixty
miles away and to reach it was his only
hope it was neither desirable nor in keep-
ing with his character to meditate upon
the appalling difficulties of the journey in
his crippled condition drawing a sleigh
loaded with a heavy and worse crippled
dog for to shortys everlasting honor be
it said that the idea of abandoning king to
be killed by the wolves or to die of his
wounds never even entered his head

  accordingly and with a great effort he
lifted king bodily into the carriole the
dog seemed for a moment inclined to resent
the liberty no man had dared to handle
him so since his puppyhood but with a
low growl and a slight wrinkling of the lip
he suffered himself to be hoisted into the
sleigh where he settled down and fell to
licking his wound again

  everything not absolutely essential
shorty left behind keeping only food for a
few days his rifle axe and robes he
hoped that the fish he had been carrying for
dog food would with the bodies of the dead
dogs and those of their late companions
sufficiently relieve the hunger of the rest of
the pack to keep them from attacking him
for the time being

  with a last sad look at the dogs he had
loved and tended so well and who had served
him so faithfully and a muttered curse at
the wolves shorty bent to the traces and
began to plod slowly in the direction of the
post

  his leg hurt him cruelly his shoulders
were sore and the carriole pulled like lead
but keeping to the ridges as much as pos-
sible and out of the deep drifts in the hol-
lows he held doggedly on his way with
short intervals for rest until nightfall
then he camped in a spruce grove and built
his fire

  he was very exhausted and in great pain
the only alleviation of his misery was that
the temperature continued comparatively
mild and that he saw no wolves he ate
a good supper but king refused food con-
tinuing to lick his shoulder

  well king you hard old nut said the
little man with a whimsical grin youd
better roll in with me tonight were both
sick men an well help keep each other
warm an if them --- wolves dont
come an get us tonight wed ought to be
pretty comfortable how about it

  king blinked but submitted condescend-
ingly to share his masters rabbitskin robe
shorty not unnaturally feeling more than
a little lonely and discouraged ventured to
pat him gently on the head and to even
that the husky submitted with unwonted
good-nature though he made no effort to
return the caress

  well you sure are one hard old case
said shorty with a sigh but king boy
youre a dandy scrapper if them stink-
in wolves show up well go out fightin
wont we

  king lifted his head and snuffed the air
but apparently scented nothing for he re-
turned to his eternal licking of his torn
shoulder

  the night passed in great discomfort for
both shortys shoulders and leg ached
and throbbed and his snatches of sleep were
broken and haunted with dreams of enor-
mous wolves king twitched and growled
all night at his side shorty woke feeling
tired and ill kings nose was hot and dry
and his temper very short

  with numb and shivering fingers shorty
got the fire going again in the ghost light
of dawn and having boiled himself a big
pot of tea and chewed a little bannock that
tasted like ashes in his mouth sat about
dressing his leg the wound was much
inflamed and the whole leg swollen but not
so much that he thought he could not walk
with it

  king still refused food but greedily drank
some melted snow shorty was inter-
ested to see him bite off some blades of
dry grass that stood up above the snow and
chew them up then he allowed himself to
be helped into the carriole where he curled
himself up and gave his whole attention
once more to his shoulder

so the pathetic little proces-
sion started again-a crippled
man hauling a crippled dog
across a frozen and barren wilder-
ness under a gray sky and with a knife-
edged wind lashing them like a whip

  shorty was ill-equipped by nature for
wading through snow his stumpy legs sank
almost to the knee at every step here and
there were drifts he had to cross treacher-
ous drifts of which the crust often broke and
let him through to his waist in soft snow

  but he was as hard as iron and of indomi-
table spirit and he made most amazing
king the husky



time in the circumstances despite fre-
quent stops and the pain of his leg he had
covered some twenty miles before darkness
and exhaustion forced him to halt in a wil-
low thicket

  kings nose was still dry and hot and he
could not be prevailed upon to eat though
he licked snow continually and drank
thirstily any water that shorty gave him
his temper however had improved not
that he showed either gratitude or affection
but he permitted himself to be handled
without even a growl and curled up beside
shorty as a matter of course when he lay
down for the night

  for shorty the second night was worse
than the first his shoulders were not
quite so painful but that was more than
counterbalanced by the condition of his
leg which burned and throbbed and often
woke him out of his sleep with a pang of
agony

  the third morning dawned fair but chill
with a temperature of twenty below zero
and shorty was almost frozen before he got
the fire lit but there was a decided im-
provement in kings condition and he
even languidly chewed up a small whitefish
but he was still unable to walk more than a
few steps

  shortys leg was at first so bad that he
almost despaired of continuing his journey
but after he had bound it tightly from ankle
to knee he was able to hobble though the
first half mile was an agony that brought
the sweat out on his brow the pain gradu-
ally lessened and its place was taken by a
disquieting numbness

  fearing that his foot was frozen shorty
hastily camped and made a fire when he
uncovered his foot two toes and the heel
showed a dull dead white he rubbed the
frost bites with snow until the acute misery
of their thawing out made him grind his
teeth and groan aloud

  then the leg was bound up once more and
the weary journey resumed he made few
miles that day and night found him far
gone in pain and exhaustion he was all
but ready to give up and die nothing
human could have endured much more

  but there came a gleam of hope to cheer
him king was evidently much better
he got out of the carriole by himself and ate
a hearty meal of fish it seemed likely that
he would be able to limp along by morning
at least as well as his master and in that

   

case they could leave the carriole and make
a dash for the post together

  another cheering circumstance was that
the wind which had been blowing from the
north northwest veered suddenly just after
nightfall to southwest and began to come
in warm heavy gusts shorty welcomed
it with profound thankfulness and fell asleep
full of sanguine hopes for the morrow

  but he had overtaxed his strength the
horrible dreams of the two previous nights
returned with redoubled terrors it seemed
to him that his leg swelled and swelled until
it was a mountain at which huge wolves
tore and worried with fangs of red hot iron
he tried to escape but the leg had grown
so vast that it held him prisoner and all he
could do was lie and scrabble at the ground
in awful agony

  that dream passed but was succeeded
by others and through them all throbbed
pain and fear toward morning he became
light-headed and screamed and fought with
imaginary terrors once he felt certain that
he was in the grip of a wolf and regained
momentary consciousness to discover that
it was king who had him by the arm in his
teeth and was shaking him he had a
vague impression that it was dawn and the
weather mild and then the dog let go of him
and he sank into a deep sleep that was al-
most unconsciousness

  when he awoke it was broad daylight and
the march sun was shedding warm bright
rays upon him the air was mild and
balmy and a chinook boomed across the
land he sat up weakly and looked about
him he looked and stared and looked
again king had disappeared

  it was a terrible blow the treachery
the black ingratitude of the brute was more
than he could bear in his weakened con-
dition childish tears trickled down his
face wounded and ill himself he had
dragged the worthless beast in comfort for
three days had shared with him his food
and his bedding and then when his own
strength had in a measure returned without
remorse and without shame the cowardly

-had abandoned the man who had all

but given his life for him and might yet
lose his life by what he had done

  he remembered the words of kings late
owner hes treacherous

  believing as every dog lover does in
the unswerving loyalty and fidelity of dogs
shorty felt that this evidence of callous


adventure

ingratitude had wrecked his faith in all
dog-kind yet another example of kings
depravity came to light not content with
deserting his master in his hour of direst
need he had eaten most of the scanty
stock of food remaining shorty found
himself with only about half a hard dry
bannock and some tea

  this last discovery had at least the good
effect of rousing the little man to action
he was not of the kind who lie down under
the blows of circumstance the knowledge
that he was on the verge of death from star-
vation even if he did not perish from exhaus-
tion and exposure nerved him to one last
effort he would get up and make a last
try for the post even if he fell and died in
the snow

  the wound in his leg was better the in-
flammation had gone down considerably
though his frozen foot was hideously pain-
ful moreover the fever of the previous
days had abated though he felt pitiably
weak he brewed himself some strong tea
ate a portion of his half bannock bound up h is
leg carefully and cutting himself a stout
willow staff took the trail

  he left behind him the carriole his blan-
kets even his rifle his axe he had to take he
needed it to cut firewood and it would be
his only weapon in his last fight if he were
again attacked by wolves

 for the wolves were back again a
gaunt brute loped across the skyline into
some scrub just as he set out a prick-eared
gray head thrust up from behind a rock to
his right

  all that afternoon he stumbled on his
way stopping often for short rests the
low sun sank but still the blessed chinook
swept across the waste while it blew he
would not at any rate freeze to death
had the temperature been below zero
death would have claimed him early

  then a big silver moon swung up and
gave him good light to travel by

  he decided it was useless to camp for
the night he must press on until he reached
the post which could not be many miles
away now either that or fall exhausted
or be pounced on by the wolves there
were wolves everywhere now and his im-
agination created another of every inky
shadow the moon cast upon the snow

  they began to close in upon him no
longer did they keep at a distance they
kept pace with him composedly at a few

yards distance there were wolves on
the skyline waiting for him and when he
looked back there were wolves slinking along
in his very footprints they did not need
to attack they had merely to bide their
time and let their prey wear himself out
in vain efforts to escape

  he was moving very very slowly hardly-
moving at all now and his tired eyes were
playing him unholy tricks it was not only
his terrifying pursuers who were endued
with motion the landscape expanded and
contracted stretching itself out to infinity
under the rays of the moon or rushing to-
gether in one shapeless blur the low hills
climbed on each others backs to get a look
at him and the skyline waved like a length
of water weed in a swift running stream

  he came to the foot of a ridge it was
scarcely a hundred feet high but it seemed
to him to shoot up to the stars like an im-
passable mountain barrier he sank down
wearily in the snow and asked himself
seriously whether it was really worth while
to attempt such an arduous climb the
wolves formed a ring around him they
made no sound but every second that
passed found the ring a little narrower

  he was too tired even to be afraid but
the indomitable fighting spirit in him still
lived he raised a feeble shout and shook
his axe at them they drew back a little
and he got dizzily to his feet and stumbled
stubbornly up the slope

  but now he felt that the end had really
come a huge wolf a lop-sided ungainly
lurching brute was coming slowly but pur-
posefully straight at him and behind him
at a little distance came a compact dark
mass that could only be the body of the
pack

  he gave a little grim laugh yes this
was the end but he would fight it out
he went down on one knee the better to
brace himself for the onset his axe poised
for his last blow the great wolf still lopped
grotesquely toward him

  he measured the distance with his eye
he could not be quite sure since everything
was so blurred and hazy but he thought
another bound would bring the beast within
striking distance he summoned all his
failing energies and swung his axe upward

 come on-you he cried

  but the blow never fell for on a sudden
a mans voice answered him

  hello there hello
questing



  shorty was stricken motionless with sur-
prise and in that instant the lame wolf gave
a last convulsive bound and was upon him
man and wolf rolled over in the snow to-
gether the man fighting feebly to keep the
fangs from his throat but the wolf only
made curious little eager whimpering noises
and licked his face

  slowly it penetrated into the little mans
dulled brain that he was saved that after
all king had proved loyal he sat up
his arms tight around king who was boring
his nose into his masters breast with soft
snorts and whimpers of devoted love

  the wolf pack resolved itself into a
team of dogs and a carriole a man in a

policemans uniform was standing over him

  well here you are eh said the police-
man in a hearty voice assumed to hide his
emotions some dog that of yours blew
into the post around noon today wouldnt
eat wouldnt let anybody put a finger on
him wouldnt do a thing but bark and howl
and raise the -- until i hooked up and
followed him and him hardly able to put
one foot in front of the other id give a
million dollars for a dog like that

  shorty raised a proud head though the
tears glistened in his eyes

  you couldnt have this here dog he
said for a hundred million dollars you
king oh you king

l iacombe slapped viciously at
i ika  moscluoes which were feast-
i j  ing on his fat naked thighs then
	 turned and looked up at the

gray-bearded counsellors who were grouped
behind him

  as well expect to find wisdom in the
bleating of goats as in the words which come
from your mouths he growled peevishly
a price for everything you say that is
good that is wise but what is the price
i shall demand for my country-my cattle-
my people what price shall i ask for the
blood of a nation au-a that you do not
tell me

  he accepted the pot of beer a woman
offered him and handed it to the counsellor
nearest to him-an african potentate took
very little on trust even before the advent
of the white men to his country-and after
that man had swallowed two noisy appreci-
ative mouthfuls snatched the pot back and
putting it to his lips did not lower it until
it was drained

  tchat that was good he exclaimed
as he let the empty pot fall from his hands
what have the white men to offer that
is worth even a brew of that sort

 he chuckled happily and then gazed
proudly at his warriors who lined the stock-
ade of his kraal

  and what he asked turning to his
counsellors again what price shall i
ask for my warriors-for this small regi-
ment which is gathered here to do me
honor-for the weakest man in that regi-
ment

  at least o earthshaker a counsellor
answered timidly you know the price the
white men offer

  macombe scowled as he looked at the
white men who were standing before him

  four of them wore ornate uniforms-
silver breast-plates plumed helmets tight-
fitting red riding-breeches with a wide strip
of gold braid running down the seams white
leather gauntlets cavalry swords swung
at their sides-these and the box spurs they
wore on their highly polished riding boots
jangled musically when they moved

  the fifth he stood several paces in front
of the others was a furtive looking grubby
little man he was dressed in filthy grease-
stained rags his mouth was hidden by a
ragged mustache which straggled down so
that it was hard to say where it ended and
his beard began his red-rimmed eyes were
watery he scratched himself continually

  meeting macombes scowl he smirked
self-consciously

  it is permitted that i speak o earth-
shaker he asked
-and of gideon



  i have done little but listen to you talk

	pig

  my name is umglubu no longer earth-
shaker i take again the name that was
mine before i came to dwell in this land
these great ones- he indicated the four
uniformed whites-call me ferdinand de
sousa

  that is all one to me macombe said
with a contemptuos laugh a man once
called a hyena a lion but that same night
the beast laughed at the moon-pig

  umglubu-the pig-known to the police
authorities at lisbon as ferdinand de
sousa and wanted by them for several
despicable crimes-shrugged his shoulders
and laughed feebly at macombes joke

  at least it is permitted that i speak
he asked again when he had recovered his
composure

  macombe inclined his head with pompous
gravity

  this i would say umglubu continued
breathlessly the portuguese king is all
powerful his soldiers are more numerous
than the grains of sand on the river bed and
they go to and fro on the great waters in
houses spouting smoke should a nation
annoy him-then that nation ceases to be
its kraals are blotted out its men-folk
killed the women are given to his soldiers
and the cattle are added to his herds what
then does such a powerful king want with
this poor country of macombes why
does he send his most trusted advisors to
deal with macombe

  that is something i am still waiting
to hear macombe interrupted irritably
why dont you white men of all tribes
remain in your own countries and leave us
black ones alone we have no need of you
we do not sleep or eat better because of
your coming i grow weary of all this my
ears are deafened by the voices of white
men who laud themselves and the race from
which they came and yet seek to take to
themselves this so worthless land of mine

	tell you that i distrust the man who
leaves his own platter of mealie-meal and
comes to dip his hand in mine-yet praises
the excellence of his own for such a man
there is only one reply he squeezed his
nose with his thumb and forefinger and
added i do not like liars

  the four uniformed men moved uneasily
as a native one of their servants gave them
a garbled translation of macombes speech

one of them whispered something to their
spokesman he nodded reassuringly

  do not judge too hastily he said to the
chief these white men the mouthpieces
of the great white king do not seek your
land your cattle or the blood of your war-
riors they ask only that you and your
counsellors make your marks on the talking
paper and so proclaim to the world that you
and their overlord have entered into a
treaty of peace that done they will see
to it that no white men come into your
country without your permission only
these four and their friends shall be per-
mitted to come and go as they will in re-
turn for this they will give you many guns
and ammunition and so with their aid
you will be a great power in the land-no
one shall stand before you

  macombe snorted

  i have yet to see a white man give so
much for so little tell me again what the
talking paper says

  seven times i made known its voice to
you yesterday o macombe-five times i
have made it known to you today and
to what end the tale of it is always the
same it can not lie

  mens memories are shorter than my
shadow at noon the chief said senten-
iously i have forgotten

  umglubu turned to his companions and
from one of them took a roll of parchment
he winked slyly then turning to face ma-
combe undid the ribbon with which the roll
was tied and smoothed out the parchment
holding it so that macombe and his counsel-
lors could see the gold-colored seals which
were affixed to it

  he took a deep breath then read swiftly
sounding as if he were reciting a passage
learned by heart

  and he conluded in return for this
small favor i promise to protect-with all
the force and arms of my kingdom-the
land of macombe from the grasping hands
of all other white nations in addition i will
give to macombe five thousand rifles five
thousand ball cartridges and much powder
and-

  followed a list of trade goods well calcu-
lated to please a not over sophisticated
savage ruler

macombe nodded when it was finished
it is a lot to give for the little asked
permission to dig a few holes in my coun-
try-that is all what can come from a hole


adventure

in the ground that can be so valuable in a
white mans eyes yellow dirt tchat
but five thousand rifles-only five thou-
sand you said

  no six thousand umglubu said hur-
riedly macombe did not hear with open
ears

  i could wish that my friend the black-
robed one were here to tell me the truth
of it all

  his name is written here macombe-
umglubu pointed to a scrawled signature
on the back of the document he made
his voice here just before he died

   and the talking paper does not lie
   umglubu spread his hands

  how could it macombe would
blackcoat have put his voice to a lie
no what is written is written it is surer
than the spoken work which cannot be re-
called macombe and his counsellors agree
then to make their marks

  not so fast not so fast hurry the ox
and it will he down

  he turned away and after a whispered
consulation with his counsellors entered his
hut without further speech to the white
man

  the uniformed men talked excitedly and
when their spokesman joined them re-
proached him for insisting that they come
to the kraal unarmed

  i dont like the look of the warriors
one said and we are helpless if we had

our pistols-

  your death would be a little slower but
just as sure that is all de sousa the pig
said scathingly but have no fear they
intend us no harm-i know niggers-and
macombe will make his mark yet it is all
right i tell you tomorrow or the next
day-what does it matter to wait a week
is a small price to pay for the concession
it is best not to seem too anxious-i know
niggers i tell you lets go back to the

wagons and by the- take your hands

from your swords and look less in fear of
your life

it was noon when a messenger
came from macombe the white
men had discarded their uniforms
and were sprawled at ease in deck
chairs which their native servants had
placed in the shade of a wide branched
baobab tree the man de sousa was seated
on a rock near by endeavoring to dislodge

with a thorn a jigger which had burrowed
under a toe nail he was listening to the
others talk of theaters and the gay life of
lisbon with hunger-filled eyes

  macombe would speak to you said the
messenger a wrinkled-faced gray-bearded
native

  you hear that de sousa shouted
macombe wants to see me that can only
mean one thing

  the others jumped to their feet and-
began to get into their uniforms the

messenger eyed their preparations with
disfavor

  tell them he said that macombe
wishes to speak with you-alone

  is he going to make his mark de sousa
asked the messenger when he had told the
others that he was to go alone and they had
reseated themselves their faces showing
great relief

  the native nodded

  we think it is folly- but macombe will
not be moved he is like a young bull
he disregards the council of the gray-

beards

  hes going to give us the concession
de sousa shouted excitedly clutching at the
arm of one of the others what did i tell
you dandra and you you will keep
your word because of this there shall
be no more talk of hangings i shall be
permitted to return to portugal a free
man a good pension will be paid me and
ah there shall be wine and women
and-

  dandra-he was a tall thin man there
was a hard cold gleam in his eyes and his
well-waxed mustache curled away from a
-and of gideon



small cruel mouth-impatiently shook the
others hand from his sleeve

  i have given my word he said coldly
you shall be suitably rewarded have no
doubt of that but i did not promise to
embrace you

  de sousa scowled

  you treat me as if i were no better than
sewer scum he said with sullen bitterness
you remember many things about me that
i seek to forget you think of my black
wives and the years i have lived like a pig
in this country-lived anywhere to get be-
yong the reach of the prison and death that
awaited me but- his face lighted his
voice took on a triumphant note-you for-
get that i make it possible for you to take
back this concession without me your mis-
sion would have failed my name will be
remembered when yours-dandra-is for-
gotten

  he hurried away up the hill and entering
the kraal came to the hut of macombe
there he was stopped by armed warriors
macombe sent for me he said confi-
dently out of my way dogs

  he now tells you to rest awhile one
answered and sends you beer to drink
while you wait

  they forced him to sit on an upturned
gourd gave him a large pot of beer and stood
guard over him

  the sun was hot the beer potent after
a little while he slept

 it was nearly sundown when he was
awakened by the sharp points of assegais
sticking into his ribs looking up he saw
macombe standing before him surrounded
by his counsellors and bodyguard

  i have slept a long time macombe
he faltered

  truly-and it is not wise to sleep in the
sun- the beer i sent you was perhaps too
strong the chief commented solicitiously

  it was good beer-much better than
those wives of mine used to brew

  it is the custom of wives to brew a heady
mixture macombe said dryly then added
sharply where is the talking paper that
i may make my mark on it

  all sleep left umglubus eyes with a
flourish he produced the parchment from
his tattered garments he took an ink-horn
and quill pen

  with eager trembling fingers he pointed
to where the chief and his counsellors should
make their marks and when that was done

he rubbed the inky pen over the ball of
macombes thumb and pressed it on the
parchment beside his sprawling mark

  the paper does not lie you say ma-
combe questioned slowly when all was
finished

  no macombe

  and you spoke its words to me
  truly

  au-a i am still amazed that white men
should give so much for so little now let
us go and bid those others-whose mouth-
piece you are-to celebrate the thing we
have done twelve oxen shall be killed
my young men and maidens shall dance
escorted by his bodyguard his big
powerful hand firmly clasping umglubus
shoulder his counsellors following closely
behind macombe left the kraal and walked
slowly down the hill to where the white men
had outspanned

  but there was no sign of wagons or horses
or men only the gray ashes of fires and a
litter of empty bottles and tins showed
where the white men had camped

  umglubu ferdinand de sousa the pig-
felt strangely alone and afraid

  macombes grip tightened on his shoul-
der

  they have gone the white man cried
in distress

  aye-so they have macombe agreed
heavily i had forgotten they left in
great haste-shortly after noon it was
first i spoke to them though through the
mouth of one of their black dogs who spoke
their tongue and mine

  but

  but why you would ask au-a they
are true men they do not like liars or deal
in lies when i made known to them that i

knew that the talking paper lied they-

  it does not lie macombe the white
man shouted fearfully

  fool macombe said sternly fool to
lie-and a still greater fool to judge ma-
combe a fool shall i have mzila here-
he indicated the wizened counsellor who
had come for umglubu earlier in the day
with the message that the chief wished to
speak with him--repeat what the talking
paper said the first time you gave us its
words and the last time and all the times
in between and if the paper this time
spoke of fifty rolls of red cloth while at that

time it spoke of sixty rolls of blue-

  mzila is old the white man began his


adventure

eyes shifting constantly his feet scuffling
in the red dust of the veld mzila is old
and-

  mzila lies or forgets you would say
the pressure of macombes hand was a
torture mzila lies to what end
mzila forgets au-a mzila who can re-
member all the years and the happenings
of those years back to the day when my
fathers father was born aye and before
that au-a be not a fool as well as a
liar

  and so when i spoke of these things
to the white men who dress as great war-
riors they acted as great warriors should
they washed their hands of you-o dirty
one who has never washed-they denied
that you were their mouthpiece they told
their black dogs to inspan and drove hur-
riedly away it may be he added with a
chuckle-that they feared somewhat the
assegais of my warriors-they are very
sharp and always thirsty for the blood of
liars

  he looked at umglubu with amused toler-
ance laughed aloud when the little man
tried to squirm out of his grasp laughed
again when the white man his face livid
with fear shook his fist and screamed
gasped at the curses and blasphemies which
tumbled from the white mans lips in a
garbled torrent of words-at first the words
had no meaning to macombe but present-
ly-the full portent of the desertion coming
home to him--the white man forgot the
tongue to which he was born and cursed
solely in the language of the country

  peace little one macombe said mildly
you have cause only to rejoice i have
put my mark to the talking paper which
i leave in your hands you still live-and
i have not ordered my warriors to kill you
instead-see how merciful i am-i give
you into the safe keeping of your wives
they still have a great regard for you
their huts have been empty since the com-
ing of those white warriors they have
mourned your absence and wrait eagerly for
your return to them

  go to them-and go quickly

  he pushed the white man from him with
such force that umglubu fell headlong to
the ground a moment he lay there whim-
pering then rising slowly to his feet he
gazed helplessly about him until seeing
four women advancing ponderously toward
him he fled howling along the trail taken

by the wagons the women close at his heels

  he did not get far soon they caught up
with him he struggled deperately for a
little while and then beaten thoroughly
cowed he stood meekly in their midst while
they upbraided him in loud scolding voices

  guard him well you black heifers
macombe shouted

  we will o earthshaker one of them
shouted she was enormously fat fat cov-
ered and hid her figure as much as if it
were a huge misshapen garment she was
the head wife of umglubu the pig-some-
time called ferdinand de sousa-and in the
lobe of her ear taking the place of the brass
cartridge case which usually adorned it
was the parchment to which macombe and
his counsellors had set their marks the
red ribbon with which the roll was tied
dangled coquettishly down to her shoulders

you wished to see me

don paulos dandra-son of
that dandra who twenty years
ago had tried to win a concession
from macombe-looked up with a petulant
frown from the papers he was examining so
closely wiped his hands fastidiously on a
white cambric handkerchief then leaned
back in his chair and thoughtfully toyed
with his scented well-waxed mustache

  ah yes gonzales he said with an af-
fected simper i believe i do wish to have
a talk with you yes

  he nodded as if he had had doubts
on the matter but that they were now
cleared up

  it is hard to remember anything in
this cursed hole called lourenco marques
i shall always regret that we did not sell it
to the greedy english that would be a so-
easy way to defeat our enemies sell them
this so beautiful sea-port in a little while
the garrison will all have died of blackwater
and we take the port back again to sell
to another empire-grabbing nation there
now he chuckled is not that a wonder-
ful scheme i will send a memorandum of
it to his excellency the governor

  the man called gonzales scowled and
tugged impatiently at his gray-flecked
beard his nostrils twitched constantly as if
he were trying to detect the source of a cloy-
ing odor which pervaded the room

  you did not send for me just in order
that i might listen to your buffonery did
you he growled you presume too far
-and of gideon



on the friendship i had for your father
his voice was harsh and there was some-
thing essentially brutal in the glint of his
eyes

  dandra looked up at the ceiling a mock-
pious expression on his face

  dear gonzales he murmured you
are so primitive you talk to me as if i
were one of your niggers whom you were
preparing to sjambok he brought his
watery blue eyes down to meet the others
beady black ones then he laughed softly
and wagged an admonishing forefinger
it is most gauche of you to bring the man-
ners of the veld into my office you---

  one would almost say into your bou-
doir  gonzales interrupted scathingly
and with a contemptuous gesture he indi-
cated the soft draperies which shaded the
window the soft cushions the array of
toilet preparations and the dainty orna-
ments which cluttered the room

  when his roving eye saw a bowl of incense
which was burning before a jade image in a
corner of the room he lost all restraint

  - he roared it is that which

stinks when will you be a man

  he squirted a stream of tobacco juice into
the jar then opened a window at the back of
the office with such force that a pane of
glass was shattered and tinkled in tiny
fragments on the flag-stoned courtyard of
the fort

  a gentle breeze fluttered the curtains a
breeze that was heavily laden with manifold
odors-and not one of them pleasant-of an
ill-kept tropical city

  dandra put a scent-drenched handker-
chief to his nose

  at least you will admit he said faintly
his voice muffled by the handkerchief that
the incense was better than this breath of
-

  i admit nothing gonzales said heavily
a hyena smells much worse and a kaffir
hut- he broke off with a snort now
tell me what you want and let me go per
dios if it were not for memories of your
father i would wash my hands of you
what is it this time-more money what
do you do with your pay and the money
which importers are always willing to lose
in the pockets of a custom official

  i am not asking for money senhor
gonzales dandra said stiffly though
that is always welcome and if you have a
little to spare--

  what then- gonzales ignored the
hint- women

 women i can handle without any
assistance

  that i can well believe you should
understand them fully-at least as well as
a woman understands a woman he
cursed under his breath when dandra
ignored the insult well what is it he
demanded sharply i have much to do
tomorrow i trek for the country of the
makalanga

  dandra sat erect

  that is macombes country he stated
as one making a great discovery

  of course yes gonzales said tolerant-
ly you are not quite as ignorant as i
thought

  and you are going there

  as i have said i go to escort a so
learned professor from the university of
lisbon who believes that he can locate the
lost mines of solomon a fools errand
but he pays well and it will be a peaceful
change after ivory hunting in the british
lions territory

  you nearly lost a foster father on my
last trip dandra a mounted policeman
missed me by three inches and before he
could get his sights on me for another shot
i was across the border with all my carriers
and a fine lot of tusks he was a fool not
to fire again-even if i was across the
border but your englishman is always a
fool

  he obeys the laws-except when he
breaks them all even then he appeases his
conscience by saying i am the law--and
so  thumbed my nose at that fool trooper
he cursed and swore and shook his fist at
me but that was all and i posted no
guards around my camp that night even
though only a little streamlet separated us

  and now- gonzales shoulders shook
with laughter-i return to a district which
that trooper sometimes patrols and i shall
thumb my nose at him again he can not
touch me for my little professor has letters
from the british colonial office giving his
expedition safe conduct furthermore it is
ordered that we be shown every courtesy
and given any assistance we may require
dandra rubbed his hands gleefully to-
gether

  it could not be better if i had had the
planning of it i could not have done better
he murmured


adventure

  what is that gonzales asked sus-
piciously

  wait i will tell you all in good time
but first tell me about macombes country
do the english own it

  no it is free land long ago many
tried to get a concession from the chief-
but all failed your father was one of those
who tried you did not know that it is
not strange it was not a thing to boast
about failures rarely are still he was
very young then ah well and so as i
say macombe kept his country to himself
but the british when they took over
lobenguellas country and made it rhode-
sia they unofficially notified the powers
that they would consider any tampering
with macombe an unfriendly act natu-
rally- gonzales shrugged his shoulders-
macombe was left alone

  but they have not proclaimed a pro-
tectorate or--

  they have done nothing save assume-
they are skilled in such assumptions-that
macombe was their man and was highly
appreciative of their moral excellence
one trooper specially detailed for the task
spasmodically patrols the district a native
commissioner from an adjoining district
spares time twice a year to hear complaints
at macombes kraal and always excuses
the natives from paying the hut tax which
they had no intention of paying it is a
grand gesture-almost the natives have
come to believe that he is showing a most
godlike generosity

  and there are no white settlers in the
country

  none-save for a trader who arrived
there shortly after your fathers expedition
and this trader what is his nationality
could he be bought

  he has no nationality undoubtedly he
could be bought if occasion demanded it
do you know him gonzales

  the big man smiled

  no but his name is isaacs

  dandra made a moue of disgust

  these jews they inherit the earth
  gonzales nodded

  true but they are great explorers
first the hunters then the jew traders then 
the missionaries and after them-you have
heard the old saying

  of course-you are long-winded gon-
zales is there a missionary in the district
so i have heard-a newcomer

  he would have his price too
undoubtedly all men- gonzales
broke off with an oath we gossip like
old women he said irritably yet looked
with renewed interest at dandra that
young exquisite seemed to be genuinely
interested in the status of macombes
country why do you ask me all this

  i am in the governors bad books he
threatens to have me demoted because i
was a little drunk the other day

  gonzales face hardened

  well

  and so dandra continued languidly
i have decided to annex this country of
macombes and add it to our possessions
then when i have been rewarded by high
promotion i shall reprimand the governor
because he-ah-because i do not like the
way he parts his hair

  gonzales threw up his hands in a frenzy
of mock despair

  and i stay here listening to the imbe-
cile ravings of an idiot when i should be

getting ready for tomorrows trek-

  wait senhor gonzales dandra said
with a simpering laugh calm yourself
and read this

  he picked up the document which he had
been reading when gonzales had entered
it was a torn and wrinkled parchment
yellow with age and incescribably filthy

m gonzales took it and glanced
at it casually suddenly his body
stiffened his attitude changed from
indifference to tense interest he
read it through carefully examined the
signatures the gold seals and the endorse-
ment on the back of it

  por dios he exclaimed presently it
is the concession your father tried to get
from macombe twenty years ago how
did it come into your hands

  a filthy beast who called himself ferdin-
and de sousa brought it to me he had
asked to be taken to colonel dandra-
but of course it was my father he wanted
to see when i told him that my respected
father was dead he mumbled something-
i didnt understand all that he said he
spoke as if portuguese was a strange lan-
guage to him and he interlarded his talk
with a lot of queer-sounding native words-
to the effect that he hoped my sire was
burning in fire-he probably is

  i also gathered that he had been kept a
-and of gideon



slave by macombe for over twenty years
he told a funny story he spoke a lot of
his four wives they must have led him a
life of-he kept looking over his shoulder
as if afraid they were coming after him
dandra laughed

  yes-a funny story he continued
 specially the part about his escape its
too long to tell you now but he got very
violent toward the end he demanded that
i give him an outrageous sum of money-
threatening to tell every one how my father
had played the part of a coward twenty
years ago as if any one cares i could

laugh at that-i felt sorry for the poor-

imagine gonzales four wives-and one
so fat that she could not walk but had to
be carried from her hut and placed in the
sun every day he said she wore the con-
cession in the lobe of her ear poor -

for twenty years he looked at wealth and
a mountain of fat i felt sorry for him un-
til he threw that filthy thing- dandra
indicated the parchment gonzales was still
holding-at me then i was forced to call
two orderlies and have him ejected he
fought-but they were too strong for him

and he was very old and so-

  dandra brushed the palms of his hands
lightly together

  where is this ferdinand de sousa now
he is probably burning in company
with my father dandra said lightly
the struggle with my orderlies was too
much for him he died noisily just out-
side the door

gonzales looked curiously at dandra
is that a pose he muttered or are
you really as callous as that sounds if
you are- his eyes narrowed to small slits-
i have great hopes for you

  never mind that dandra said impa-
tiently tell me-is that concession worth
anything

  it is worth everything-worth all that it
says-if we can get the british to honor it
it is properly signed witnessed and en-
dorsed true the white men who nego-
tiated it are all dead-but they did not act
for themselves but for the crown and that
never dies probably too many of the
headmen who made their marks here are
dead but that does not matter neither
does it matter that the jesuit priest who en-
dorsed it is dead

  that is a matter for congratulation for
he signed the endorsement just before he

died believing that he was signing a letter
he had dictated to your father but his
signature is unmistakable no one will dare
to challenge it

  then there is nothing to stop us from
annexing the country dandra cried ex-
ultantly

  gonzales shook his head doubtfully

  it is not as easy as that he said fif-
teen years ago-even ten years ago-we
would only have had to produce this- he
tapped the parchment-and take posses-
sion but now--it will be very difficult
maybe impossible the british will not
give up macombes so easily its adminis-
tration by another power would mean re-
moving rhodesia still further from a sea-
port

  as soon as they hear of this theyll try
to prove it a forgery-and it is inasmuch as
the priest did not know what he was signing
and of course macombe didnt they
wont be able to prove a forgery but theyll
immediately get macombe to appeal to
them for protection remember - they
have his ear they have been on friendly
terms with him for many years and our
government is not exactly popular with the
natives also the british are in a sense
in possession and our government dare not
risk coming to an open rupture with
them-

  but international law- dandra be-
gan

  gonzales sneered

  possession is nine points of that you
forget that the big powers make interna-
tional laws-we smaller nations obey them
no it is a wild dream for a moment i
considered it possible but after all
that- he tossed the parchment down on
the desk-is only interesting as a curio
thats all

  dandra smiled

  for a man who has the reputation of
being the cunningest ivory poacher and
dealer in black ivory in the country you are
singularly dense you are unable to make
use of the opportunities which present them-
selves do you think that i mean to pub-
lish this concession until i have taken pos-
session not so when you leave for ma-
combes country tomorrow morning i shall
go with you-you must arrange that for me
with the governor it shall be said that i
have gone on a hunting trip that you are
taking me to-er-make a man of me


adventure

  our porters shall all be of the military
they will look like porters yes but their
rifles and ammunition will be hidden in their
packs and yes i think it will be pos-
sible for us to take also two maxim guns
we will disguise them as-what does it
matter it is not necessary to be over
clever when dealing with the british think
how the boers imported arms under their
noses in piano frames

  further-it is to be remembered that
the british have given us free entry and
promise us all the aid we desire they are so
eager to advance the cause of science-spe-
cially when there is an outside chance that
science may locate rich gold reefs for them
dandra looked triumphantly at gon-
zales

  i was wrong when i called you a fool
gonzales said slowly a little i am be-
ginning to see-

  ah youve caught the scent eh
dandra cried exultantly and so when
we have entrenched ourselves securely-
that will be easy our scientist will have to
excavate-we hold macombe prisoner un-
til he implores the protection of our great
government-and that too should be easy
it is rumored that you have most persuasive
ways with niggers

  that done and the rest is easy we will
have the concession plus a peaceful occupa-
tion backed up by a request from the chief
that we take over his country the lion
will squeal and growl-but that is all
public opinion will be against him and he is
afraid of that

  you are a clever- dandra and

i believe it will work in any case we
cant lose we ought to acquire wealth as
the result of this

presumably the two white men
were hunting each carried a gun-
one a modern small-bore rifle the
other an old-fashioned very heavy
smooth-bored weapon which looked as if it
would be infinitely more dangerous to the
user than the target he aimed at

  they walked with exaggerated caution
peering constantly to the right and left
parting the bushes with steady searching
hands taking each step with as much care
as if they were walking on eggs but the
silence of their footfalls their clever avoid-
ance of dried twigs-the snapping of which
might give the alarm to some wild creature

of the bush--was completely nullified by
their incessant chatter and gay carefree
laughter

  at one place they had surmounted a
slight rise and all about them the bush had
thinned giving them a clear view of a wide
valley down the center of which the dark
green of the bush was trimmed by a glisten-
ing silver ribbon of water and here they
halted and watched a herd of elephants
playing in the river shallows

  lets go nearer the man in black said
breathlessly

  nunno i vouldnt go any nearer them
beasts for anything my but theyre a
sight to watch aint they

  pooh its safe enough we could get
right up close to them-the winds right
come along isaacs

  nunno missioner it might be safe
and then again it might not and if it vasnt
we vouldnt have no second thought be-
sides its farther to them elephants than
vot you think

  the other nodded regretfully

  id like nothing better than to stay here
and watch them wish id brought my
field glasses along

  isaacs smiled

  youre a great hunter you are how
often do you think a lion vould eat if he sat
down and watched vonderful sights like
that- he indicated the distant herd of
elephants with a flowery wave of his hand
an the bush is full of them if a fallows got
eyes to see an anyway youll have a
chance to see them very close pretty soon
well have to have a elephant hunt they
are getting too cheeky theyre beginning
to take vot dont belong to them ma-
combe sent me vord that theyre raiding the
crops near his kraal at misongwe theyll
be knocking down the huts next veil
lets go on

  as he spoke he placed his heavy gun care-
fully underneath a bush

  ill get it vhen we come back- his
deep booming voice sounded oddly incon-
gruous coming from such a puny body
i dont vant to carry it any farther any-
vay we vont see no game he looked up
at his black-garbed companion his black
eyes greatly magnified by the strong-lensed
glasses he wore twinkling with mirth and
i can talk better vithout it he added

  the others thin lips twitched in an an-
swering smile
-and of gideon



  when i look at that hideous shirt of
yours he said-it was a vivid crimson with
wide green stripes-i dont think you want
to see any buck and i dont believe youd
shoot one if you saw one

  isaacs grinned

  maybe not missioner but the shirt
now it is a good shirt aint it an
pretty and anyvay about the buck-
vhen i wear a shirt like this i give them a
sporting chance they see it an if theyre
wise they run like --- for leather and
w for waxworks he added quickly with a
supplicating glance at his companion

  that doesnt help you isaacs that
man said triumphantly youre fined one
shilling

  isaacs made a woeful face

  oy he exclaimed ill be ruined
ten shillings i owe you already and weve
only been gone from the store three hours

vots a couple o-

  that makes it twelve shillings ill be
able to get another chair for the mission at
this rate

  isaacs chuckled then said seriously
you ought to be a storekeeper sure you
ought vhy dont you come in partner-
ship vith me think of the money youd
make youre a good man vasted you
hadnt ought to be a missioner that aint

a mans job anyvay an-

  the lords work is essentially a mans
job the other said with solemn pomposity
then he coughed and seemed to be greatly
interested in a vulture which was hovering
high over-head

  isaacs looked at him slyly

  oy but im disappointed in you
mister miles he said that you should
talk business here you make me think of
stuffy buildings an honest men callin each
other liars an liars sayin theyre honest
an for a foment i forget all this he
flung his arms wide to indicate the surround-
ing country even the shilling youve got
to pay me aint goin to make up for it i
ought to raise the price an that vulture
now-hes a filthy scavenger but he looks
 pretty up there an he flies high dont he
 the reverend mr miles looked down at
saacs

  im sorry he said simply but you
trapped me into that you know you did
sure isaacs admitted but i cant
lose all the time that aint good business
- no

  thirteen you heathen

  they walked on for a while in silence and
then isaacs waved his hands and jumped
excitedly up and down

  there was a snort a padding of hooves
and a cloud of dust sprang up from the
ground directly in their path some bushes
swayed as if touched by a gentle breeze-
then all was still again

  miles looked accusingly at the little bow-
legged storekeeper

  that was a buck wasnt it

  sure a kudu bull he was sleepin
in the shade of the ant-hill but you
couldnt shoot a sleepin buck-that aint
sportin so i made him run for you-
vhy didnt you shoot

  youre a funny fellow the missionary
said slowly

 oy lugubriously maybe i am a
little queer maybe it is that i have
live alone so long vith the natives so
that i have come to think and act like
them

  no the missionary shook his head
i didnt mean that besides what native
would pass up an opportunity of killing a
buck just because it was asleep no
you act and talk like the white man you

are and-

  isaacs squirmed uncomfortably

  never mind that he said hastily but
about the buck now vhy shoot em we
have plenty of food in tins and chickens
besides its cheaper to talk-ammunition
dont cost nothing

  all right miles assented let us sit
over there

  he pointed to a jumble of rocks which
fringed a small clearing

they made themselves as corn-
s fortable as possible and isaacs
ply lighting a cigar lolled back his
hands clasped behind his head
and puffed contentedly

  miles not having yet learned the value
of complete relaxation-it is necessary in
order for a white man to conserve the
strength which africa constantly and in-
sidiously tries to sap from him-sat erect
his hands clasped about his knees he
hummed softly one of the barbaric chants of
the natives of the district his feet tapped to
its tempo

  about that song now- isaacs said
presently


adventure

  the humming stopped but miles feet
still tapped the savage rhythm

  yes he questioned eagerly he knew
that the storekeeper was about to give him
a dissertation on some strange custom of the
people he knew so well the mans fund
of knowledge his understanding of the
black mans psychology was an unfailing
source of amazement to miles he knew
too that without the storekeepers active
assistance his mission would be an abject
failure

  but before isaacs could continue a loud
snorting noise sounded from a near-by
thicket

  both men sprang to their feet miles
gun up to his shoulder his finger toying
nervously with the trigger they saw a
shadowy form making its way noisily
through the long grass-saw a tufted tail
waving above its back

  its a lion miles gasped and fired
just as isaacs knocked up the muzzle of
his gun

  what- the missionary began hotly
then run isaacs

  he turned himself and made for a tree
standing on the opposite side of the clear-
ing just as the beast came galloping out of
the bush it stopped midway across the
clearing and gazed suspiciously at isaacs
blinking its near-sighted eyes the little
man stooped and picking up a pebble
flicked it at the beast it hit the bush pig
on the snout turning with incredible
speed the beast rushed to an ant-bear hole
whirled swiftly and backed into it but
that hole already had an occupant and the
pig taking the ungentle hint of the tenant
catapulted out of the hole with a squeal and
made for another one

  he went into that with even greater
speed than hed already shown seeming to
lunge backward but the hole was too
small for him his narrow hindquarters
entered easily enough-but there he stuck
half in and hah out the expression on the
pigs ugly face-an expression of hurt sur-
prize and realization of his helpless position
-was too much for isaacs he laughed-
a shrill piping laugh-until the tears ran
down his plump red cheeks laughed until
his thin legs crumpled up under him for
weakness and he sat on the ground his
hands to his sides seeking to control the
laughter which verged on hysterical giggles

  go away he gasped weakly as miles

looking very shamefaced his clothing torn
in several places-unfortunately the tree he
had selected to climb was of a very thorny
variety-came and stood over him you
were so foony isaacs continued you
and the bush pig-look at him

  you knew it wasnt a lion from the
first miles said accusingly why didnt
you tell me

  vhy didnt i tell you you ask isaacs
said between giggles you gave me no
time you was in so much of a hurree
you know missioner you vas just like that
bush pig first you shoot off at something
vot isnt so and then you go an climb a tree
you cant climb but youre improving
sure you are but aint that pig a good
sermon now an aint he foony

  a smile broke the missionarys stern ex-
pression the smile became a chuckle the
chuckle a peal of laughter the bush pig
looked at them aggrievedly looked back
over his shoulder to see what was holding
him and then squealed an accompaniment
to the hilarious laughter of the two men

 will--he-be-able-to-get-out
miles asked pointing a shaking finger at the
trapped beast

  sure he vill as soon as he stops squealing
and uses his brains he aint held as fast
as all that a wiggle or two an hell be
out see hes getting vise already

  as isaacs spoke the pig stopped squealing
and began to paw frantically at the ground
under his fore feet slowly at first then
with a rush he managed to extricate him-
self once free of the hole he shook himself
vigorously turned and looked at the hole
reproachfully and then tossing his head he
slunk sheepishly off into the bush appar-
ently very self-conscious and sensitive to
the laughter of the two men

  they were still laughing-quite oblivious
to their surroundings-when a horseman
appeared suddenly out of the bush and
reined his horse to a halt not many feet
from them

        he was an elegant creature-
gpa man evidently more accus-
tomed to upholstered divans than
the hard leather of a saddle
more accustomed to course dinners than
brick-velds more familiar with the flesh
pots than a billy the exaggerated cut
of his clothes-a romanticized comic opera
idea of what a man should wear on the veld
-and of gideon



-accentuated his soft effeminate appear-
ance

with one elegantly gauntleted hand rest-
ing lightly on his hip the other tenderly
caressing his mustache he watched the
two men for a moment a sneer on his face
presently he spoke-

  you must be mad i think

  the two men looked up with a start
isaacs springing to his feet then they
began to laugh again

  the horseman frowned bit his bottom
lip flicked impatiently at the swarm of
flies which hovered about him and

 my name is dandra paulos dan-
dra he said in a cold contemptuous voice
i am not accustomed to having pigs laugh
at me

  isaacs hid the interest he felt in the slight
foreign accent in the mans voice

  softly now he muttered and put a
soothing hand on miles sleeve as that man
was about to make a heated retort the
missionary did not like being called a pig
neither did isaacs but-

  oy he said dont get angry mis-
ter we vasnt laughing at you nunno
we was a laughing at a bush pig vot got
stuck in an ant-bear hole he vas very
foony you would have laughed yourself
had you see him first he tried to get
into a hole vot already had somebody in
it an then he tried to get into a hole vot
was too small for him an he got stuck-
an he vas very foony

  isaacs beamed at the man who called
himself dandra as if hoping to find an
answering twinkle of mirth in that mans
eyes seeing only suspicious resentment
there he continued in almost apologetic
tones i aint jokin mister if you dont
believe me ask the missioner here his
names miles-mister the reverend miles
mines isaacs joseph isaacs-though most
people call me big un thats because
im so small maybe the english are very
foony aint they you portuguese aint

you on a huntin trip no you-

  dandra waved his hand impatiently
no we do not come to hunt we have
come on a scientific mission-to locate the
lost mines of solomon we intend to stay
at your store tonight-of course youre
isaacs the storekeeper-and tomorrow we
go on to misongwe to go through the formal-
ity of asking the chief-macombe isnt
it-for permission to dig

  isaacs nodded and miles-he had been
stubbing his toes in the dirt trying to over-
come his instinctive dislike of dandra
-now looked up with interest

  and i suppose you will also isaacs
said slowly go through the formality of
asking the storekeeper for permission to
stay at his store

  oh you dandra scoffed why
should wre do that you of course have
your price which we will pay that is
all there is to that you naturally sell
hospitality as you sell trade goods to
niggers

  again the pressure of isaacs hand on his
arm prevented the missionary from making
a hot retort

  sure isaacs agreed complacently i
have my price-a man must eat how
many are there in your party

  two other white men and one hundred
and fifty porters

  - isaacs looked quickly at the

missionary whose lips formed fourteen
vot you goin to do with all them an
anyvay you dont expect me to feed all
them do you

  oh no dandra said airily senhor
gonzales-hes in charge of the expedition-
believes in allowing the carriers to live off
the country we pass through they can
take care of themselves at some near-by
kraal what they want-theyll take
you mean that you dont pay for the
grain and stuff your porters take from the
kraals miles asked hotly

  dandra looked at him with amused
contempt

  naturally not he replied with a shrug
of his thin shoulders why should we
macombe vont like that isaacs said
gravely maybe he vont give you per-
mission to stay in his country vhen he hears
of it

  we stay whether he gives us permission
or not dandra said indifferently we
have letters from the british colonial
office giving us all the permission we need
if macombe is at all temperamental why
-we shall use force

  oy isaacs nodded his head as if in
hearty agreement with such measures
thats different a nigger aint got no
right to say vot a vhite man should do in his
country but how about me he added in
grieved tones if you dont pay for all
the stuff your porters take how can the
io

adventure

niggers make deals with me vhere do i
stand

  dandra laughed

 you - who cares anything

about the affairs of a lousy little -

of a jew-

  thats quite enough from you miles
said in a cold quiet voice he shook off
isaacs restraining hand if you dont
apologise to mr isaacs at once ill pull you
off your horse and beat some courtesy into
you

  dandra stiffened and turning in his
saddle looked back to see if the rest of his
party was in sight but his eyes met noth-
ing save a seemingly endless vista of bush
-unbroken unrelieved by any moving
thing he turned back

  i am very sorry mr isaacs he mum-
bled in ungracious tones he flashed a
resentful glance at miles

  thats all right isaacs hastily assured
him vot you said vasnt anything to
me of course the missioner didnt like it
but me i knew you vas only joking an
now mister ive got a proposition to make
id like to get things ready for you an your
friends-hot vater for baths and a good
meal theyll be along soon vont they

  dandra nodded

  they cant be far behind i rode on be-
cause i wanted to be the first to get a decent
bath

  oy isaacs exclaimed admiringly an
you rode on alone in a strange country just
to get a vash first my you might have
got lost

  the trail is wide and well defined
dandra said contemptuously

  sure it is but it takes a man vot
knows to follow it now me

  he spread his fingers and hunched up his
shoulders until they nearly touched his
large outstanding ears turn me around
just once an im lost

  dandra smiled sourly

  he was clever enough to take isaacs
sycophantic flattery for what it was worth
but he was not clever enough to realize the
storekeeper was deliberately helping him to
arrive at an absolutely incorrect estimate of
his character and ability in isaacs dan-
dra saw just what the little man wanted
him to see a fawning cringing storekeeper
with no thought above making as big a
profit as possible in all his dealings a man
who meekly accepted insults in the hope of

being able to sell his insulter something at
twice its value

  certainly dandra thought their mis-
sion had nothing to fear from the store-
keeper about the missionary he was not
so sure he decided that it would be wise
to get into that mans good books to try to
wipe out the unfavorable impression he had
made if he didnt gonzales would be
very angry dandra shuddered slightly
he was afraid of gonzales who had as-
sumed complete charge of the expedition
from the time it left lourenco marques
and he ruled with an iron fist his sjam-
bok was busy all day long and once he had
even threatened dandra that was after
he had seen dandra conversing too famili-
arly with one of the native porters

  remember he had said then our
policy on the trip is severity toward nig-
gers-always that always show them the
mailed fist and no glove on it no exhibi-
tion of softness what we want we take
but we must be on friendly terms with all
the whites we meet in macombes country
and on the way up at least until weve
gained out objective after that- he had
shrugged his shoulders but dont forget
my order dandra unless you wish to taste
the kiss of my sjambok

  remembering all this dandra smiled
wistfully at isaacs and then at miles

  as a matter of fact he said humbly
i was lost i think that the reaction i
experienced at finding you gentlemen and
knowing that i was safe is the explanation
of my ungraciousness again senhor isa-
acs- he bowed-a thousand pardons

  thats all right mister isaacs assured
him you vasnt insulting but now
as i vas saying it vould be nice if i could
go ahead and get things ready for you
but its a long vay an my legs are short
an i cant valk very fast but now-you
vont think me cheeky-supposin you
let me ride your horse up to my store an
you valk up with the missioner-then i
could have everything ready for you

  dandra hesitated a moment

  all right he said finally id like to
walk up with you sir he turned to miles-
if youll permit it undoubtedly there is
much you can tell me about this country
that will make our investigations much
easier

  he dismounted and courteously held the
stirrup for isaacs to mount miles assisted
-and of gideon



in the process by giving isaacs a leg up in
the scramble the storekeepers cap fell off
but he appeared to be unconscious of it

grabbing hold of the reins
get up he yelled drumming
his heels on the beasts ribs the
forward plunge of the horse al-
most unseated him but with an effort he
recovered himself and wraving his hand gaily
he trotted off bouncing ludicrously from
side to side then he remembered his cap

  vait a bit he bellowed and sawed
at the reins pulling his horse back on to
its haunches my cap missioner it fell

off oy this hot-headed-wont stand

still

  miles picked up the long peaked cap and
ran over to isaacs with it under cover of
much yelling at the horse and its rearing
and plunging the two men exchanged a few
whispered sentences and then yelling like a
mad man isaacs gave the horse its head and
rode swiftly away

  por dios dandra exclaimed with a
wry smile he will ruin my horse and per-
haps break his own neck

  i must confess miles said slowly
that i think you were very rash to accede
to his extraordinary request

  at that moment however secure in the
knowledge that he was well out of dan-
dras sight isaacs sat down in the saddle
and rode as he well knew how to ride the
most meticulous riding master could have
found no fault with his hands though he
might have been inclined to object-purely
on the grounds of form not of technique-
to isaacs crouching seat

  presently the trail he was following began
to rise gently winding its way about the hill
on the top of which he had built his store
and half an hour later he came to a small
well-ordered kraal the huts were all
neatly thatched the pathway to each door
was picked out by whitewashed boulders
and about the whole place there was an air of
orderly cleanliness entirely foreign to most
kraals here was none of the objectionable
features white men usually associate with
native villages there were no evidences of
a white mans civilization-no empty bully
tins and broken down chairs cluttering
the place

  none of the natives wore the discarded

raiment of some white man save for the

whitewashed stones the absence of filth

   

nauseating smells and mange-eaten curs the
kraal was most truly a native one

  in this kraal-isaacs spoke of it as my
kraal to people he liked-the men and
women dressed as had their forefathers
they cultivated the ground with similar
tools hunted with similar weapons and-
absolute evidence of isaacs influence over
them-made fire by rubbing two sticks
together his trading-and he did little of
that in these later years-he did with the
other kraals of the district

  as isaacs rode through the kraal he was
hailed affectionately by men and women
fat naked littles urchin ran after him crow-
ing with delight when he called to them
by name

  coming to the hut of tomasi the head-
man he dismounted and talked for a time
to that old graybeard then mounting
again he rode up to his store

it was noon the following day
isaacs and miles were seated on
on the wide stoop surrounding
the store house watching the long
column which wound its way slowly dowrn
the hill side

  isaacs looked very tired and dirty
down the front of his flamboyant shirt was
a large muddy stain his black hair hung
down over his forehead his face badly
needed the attention of a razor one eye was
slightly discolored he bit savagely on
an unlighted cigar-but apart from that
he seemed to be completely relaxed his
chin was resting on his chest and he seemed
to have withdrawn into himself

  miles rust-black suit-isaacs called it a
uniform-was neatly pressed as usual yes-
terdays tears had been cleverly darned his
choker collar was immaculately white his
pith helmet-it was resting on his knees-
had been freshly blancoed

  he had shaved that morning but a row
of scratches on his cheek and chin showed
that his hand had not been too steady and
his flaming red hair was parted a tenth of
an inch to the right of its usual line his
blue eyes flashed angrily and he kept beating
the heels of his clenched fists together as if
in that way he would work off the nervous
energy and indignation which possessed him

  isaacs lighted his cigar inhaled luxuri-
ously and then leaning back in his chair
his hands clasped behind his head com-
pletely relaxed
adventure

  it was very foony he said and chuckled
softly

  miles sprang to his feet and paced nerv-
ously up and down the stoep

  funny big un he ejaculated you
can call it funny i think its scandalous-
no its worse than that its tragic i
shall send a messenger at once to trooper
dixon

  ive already done that missioner i did
that last night and i sent another one
riding my horse to inyati he ought to be
there in three-four days easy

  but why to inyati big un we dont
want the whole troop of police up here
dixon can handle those fellows alone all
that is necessary is for a man in authority
to tell them a few home truths a man in
a uniform can sometimes do more than fifty
in plain clothes

  veil yove got one isaacs commented

dryly oh - never mind vot i said

then i sent to inyati for more police
boys-maybe because i vanted to give
them a chance to have a little visit with me
or perhaps-to tell you the truth missioner
i dont know vhy i sent for them some-
thing seemed to tell me to thats all

  miles looked at him and shook his head
doubtfully

  you are a funny fellow isaacs he ex-
claimed i think that i know you well
and then you go and do something like this
affair last night i never know what i
should believe now last night-

  isaacs laughed

  that was very foony

  miles frowned

  i wish youd be serious he expostu-
lated how can you joke about it the
way that sneering brutal gonzales and that
horrible little cur of a dandra treated you
made my blood boil if you hadnt made
me promise not to blow off id have told
them a lot they need to hear

  no isaacs i dont understand you
why man you accepted their insults
and blows as humbly-humbly do i say
why man you crawled most abjectly
you were- he hesitated- the sort of a
man i thought you were when i first came
here you even laughed when dandra
threw a mug of beer in your face

  an vot could i have done-thrown it
back

  no i dont mean that but you see
the way you acted and looked laid yourself

open for just the sort of treatment men o
that type would give you goodness big
un i dont know when ive seen a more
degrading beastly spectacle than the one
you presented last night and the food
and the way your boys dressed and stunk
no youve got to tell me all about it-
im unable to puzzle it out for myself

  it vas all very foony isaacs insisted
doggedly

  and i suppose you call the way gon-
zales beat some of his porters funny i
suppose you think the way he treated poor
old tomasi because they couldnt find any
provisions funny and the way the por-
ters with dandra at their head went
through the huts looking for women-
that i suppose was the greatest joke of
it all

   isaacs eyes flashed

  no he said slowly that vasnt
foony-but it vas foony that they couldnt
find any provisions or women vasnt it
an vhen i think how they couldnt find any
grain at the kraal and had to buy it from
me at my price--vhy then i chuckle and
laugh ha ha he looked up at the
missionary

  you see missioner he continued i
didnt like the look of that dandra an
i didnt believe the little he said an so i
make a reason for vhy i should ride on
ahead and leave him to valk with you
an that you found foony not

  yes miles agreed reluctantly i
wish you could have seen him when he got
stuck in the mire-and of course it wasnt
my fault i was so sure i knew a short cut
to the store but then its so easy to get lost
and he walked and walked and he was
frightened and tired-his pointed shoes hurt
him-that gun of yours was so heavy but
i insisted on him carrying it    yes
that was funny all right well go on

  veil as i say i didnt trust that young
man or those he said vas with him-some-
thing here inside me warned me to be on
guard an so i rode to the kraal and told
tomasi to send the vomen away with the
grain an goats an chickens an every-
thing then i gave orders that the kraal
should be made dirty i dont think that
took them very long twenty years ive
been hounding those people yet if for one
week i miss inspecting-oy the filth an
then i came on up to my store here an my
boys made it look as them white men vould
-and of gideon

think a store kept by a man named isaacs
ought to look

  but why i still dont see why
missioner isaacs replied solemnly
vhen i meet a man who pretends to be
something vot he aint-vhy then i do the
same an so i looked as i looked an my
boys were dirty an i stuck candles in their
own grease on the table so we could see to
eat-an an i gave em goat to eat which
vas very high and tough an he concluded
triumphantly i charged them a high
price for everything

  but what are they if theyre not what
they seem to be big un the old pro-
fessors a harmless soul anyway he
hasnt a thought in his head beyond his
theory regarding the ancient workings
he was bewildered by the actions of the
other two he was contemptuous of them
and at the same time afraid and so for
the other two i dont like them dan-
dras softly vicious gonzales a brutal
monster there was no pretence about
them they were just what they were
the sooner theyre through with their re-
search work the better ill be pleased but
they cant do any lasting harm

  isaacs shook his head

  im not so sure missioner it aint
the men themselves im afraid of i only
vonder if theyre really looking for solo-
mons mines

  you saw the professors letter from the

british colonial office-

  sure but it vas his letter-not gon-
zales or dandras im just a big fool
maybe but im afraid of them men mis-
sioner i wish i could talk the portugal
talk-then i vould know vot the big man
gonzales said to that dandra vhen dan-
dra said to me-he was quite drunk-ill
hang you and your niggers when ive taken
over-an thats as far as he got missioner
for then gonzales caught him by the neck
and shouted at him and dandra vas very
frightened

  an i vould like to know vot it vas the
big man said to his porters when they got
too noisy last night over their beer now
i only know that ive never seen porters like
them before they fell in this morning just
as if they vas soldiers also id like to
know vot vas in those cases they carried
on pack mules now all i know is that
they vas very heavy

  ah veil in time we shall see

he took a small penny whistle
from his pockets and blew three
sharp blasts

twelve natives came running in
answer to its piercing summons and stood
silently before him

  they were very dirty they were naked
save for filthy loin-cloths and their hair was
daubed with some pungent-smelling grease

  the game is over isaacs said tersely
go and get clean

  they hastened away chattering gaily

  moses isaacs called and one of them
returned

  yes master

  did you obey my commands

  yes master

  did you hear anything that i should
hear or see anything my eyes would have
been glad to see a man with his back
to the speakers would have thought two
natives were talking

  no master i sat with the porters last
night until the fires burned out and the beer
which at first had opened their mouths closed
thejr eyes but i heard nothing they
spoke only of women and beer as men will

  isaacs nodded in dismissal

  get water and clean clothes ready for
me when you have bathed he said then
prepare skoff the umfundisi eats with
me and- he added with a chuckle as he
saw a uniformed horseman riding up the
hill along a trail far to the left of that taken
by the others -the policeman also

  yes master shall i cook the rest of
the goat he smiled

  no isaacs bellowed kill four chick-
ens and roast them-get cans of soup from
the store-get anything only see that
you serve a good meal we are hungry
men

  the native grinned and departed shout-
ing orders to the others as he went

  by this time the man on horseback had
ridden into full view of the men on the
stoop they rose to greet him and beamed
a welcome

  veil vhy dont you dismount isaacs
asked

  too much of a hurry big un the
other answered he wore the uniform of
a trooper in the british south african
mounted police he was a big fellow
muscular and sat his horse easily

  but youve got to stay weve got a
lot to talk about aint we missioner


adventure

  yes miles assented gravely for
one thing we want to know how it is you got
our messages so quickly we only sent
for you last night its a three-day trip to
your post-yet here you are and yet
they say the age of miracles is past

  thats right my boy isaacs chimed in
just at the very moment when we vant
to see your oogly face most you turn up-
an actually you vasnt due to patrol this
section for another monther yet sure the
missioners right its a bloomin miracle
dixon looked slightly bewildered

  well of course he began if you two
have gone nutty i suppose its my duty first
to look after you the portuguese crowdll
have to wait

  he dismounted and climbed deliberately
up the steps

  well he roared suddenly have you
two ducks been fighting i bet you have
thought you were playing this david and
jonathan stuff too hard you blamed fools
my big un the missioner made a mess of
your eye-and why are you so dirty and
solemn anyway

  never mind about that dixon miles
said impatiently we havent been fight-
ing you can be assured of that but did
we understand you to say you were after
the portuguese expedition

  dixon nodded

  yes they cant read right theyve
got a letter from the colonial office giving
them safe conduct with instructions to the
police to render them all the assistance they
may require-and all that but they seem
to think that thats giving them permission

to raise merry- pardon reverend-all

up the line

  complaints have been coming in from
all the kraals theyve visited on the way
up and the complaints include everything
from wholesale pilfering of natives stores

to violent assault--knows what all

theyve been doing a few more blighters
like them in the country and wed have a
rebellion on our hands ive been away
on patrol so i didnt know what was going
on-only got back a few days ago and found
a swarm of natives waiting outside my camp
full of complaints didnt stop to hear
them all because rumors had reached head-
quarters of what these - pardon reve-
rend were doing and there was a nice
little letter from the c o asking what the
blankety-blank i was doing and to get

after the dagoes right away or hed put me
on the peg and so i did havent lost
much time on the road either say where
are they now anyway tomasi-seems
you were wise big un and tipped the old
headman to send his women and stuff out
of the way-well he told me they spent
the night here

  they left about an hour ago theyre
going to misongwe to go through the formal-
ity of asking macombes permission to dig
if he dont give it-theyre going to dig
anyway

  dixon looked at miles quizzically won-
dering at the simpering sweetness of the
mans voice-usually it was very harsh and
nasal he didnt know that miles was
unconsciously aping the mannerisms of the
effeminate dandra

  so thats the way of it is it dixon
said quietly but theyll have to go
through the formality of asking my per-
mission first-and this too he patted
his revolver

miles and isaacs looked at each
other in relief they felt that
the menace which hovered over
the district in which they worked
-each in his own peculiar way-for the
happiness of the people would soon be
lifted having a hearty respect for the
forces of law and order themselves they
credited other people with the same respect

  at least miles did isaacs perhaps was
not quite so confident in the submission of
the man gonzales to authority and he put
his trust more in the forceful personality
the courage and the knowledge that dixon
had of the country rather than in the uni-
form he wore

  well- dixon turned to leave- if you
fellows are all right now ill trek on i
want to have a word with the man with
the whip as the natives call him before he
uses his sjambok on anv more of our peo-
ple

  no vait isaacs urged there aint
no need for such a bloomin hurry they
dont go near any kraals on the way to
misongwe-and they vont get there till
sundown so you vait an have skoff with
us and talk a bit you can easily catch
up with em

  all right dixon agreed might as

well im - your pardon reverend

hungry call one of your bright hopefuls
-and of gideon



and tell him to take care of my horse big
un but mind you youve got to wash
and change before i sit down with you

- you look like youd been dragged

through the offal heap at macombe skraal
and whys the place looking like a pig
stye

  isaacs grinned

  ill go and change now- an ill

bathe too you sit down and have a talk
with missioner hell tell you all about it
three hours later dixon looking greatly
refreshed mounted his horse ready to ride
after the column of the expedition he was
holding the reins of the missionarys horse
miles having suddenly decided to return
to his mission and as they followed the
same trail for a matter of six or seven miles
he had asked dixon to wait for him
hurry up dixon shouted

  wont be a minute miles answered
he was having a few parting words with
isaacs servants at the back of the store

  isaacs who was seated on the top step of
the stoop his elbows on his knees his chin
resting on the palm of his hands grinned

  hes a foony man dixon he always
trys to convert my boys vhen he comes
here an then apologises to me for doing it
but hes a nice fellow hell be a big man
some day

if he ever is itll be because of you big
un youve done wonders with him
nunno isaacs interposed hastily he
had it in him all the time he only needed
to be shown the vay that vas all but he

aint nearly so mealie-mouthed is he-

  no dixon agreed an come to
think of it you dont curse as much as you
used to do getting religion big un
nunno isaacs giggled im losing
money i give him a shilling every time he
hears me swear-an he counts the smallest
words mind you dixon an he gives me
a shilling every time he talks business to
me

  business

  sure professional religion stuff

  the two men laughed quietly then isaacs
sobered

  but you vont forget vill you dixon
to look around at the packs of them expe-
dition fellows

  dixon nodded

  ill keep a sharp lookout but youre
dreaming nightmares big un this here
gonzales now i know hes a rotter-hes

an ivory poacher and probably a slaver
but the business youre thinking of is an
international affair and what bloomin
chance has a used-to-be country like por-
tugal against us

  oh veil maybe youre right-maybe
youre wrong keep your eyes peeled
thats all and dixon youll come back
this way and tell us all about it vont
you

  of course big un going to stay
round here for a few days

  fine and dixon vell have a elephant
hunt while youre here the big fellows

are getting too familiar-

  at that moment miles appeared walked
briskly over to his horse and mounted

  been doing a little missionary work with
your boys big un he said hope you
dont mind

  isaacs waved his hands to signify that
that was no never mind to him

  slong dixon said ill be over to-
morrow night sure

  ill wait skoff for you slong mis-
sioner dont be so long between visits
my boysll backslide if you vait too long
a final waving of hands and the two men
spurred their horses and cantered easily
down the trail

  for a long time isaacs did not move but
sat hunched up gazing fixedly in the direc-
tion of misongwe-as if attempting to
project himself into the future and see what
play fate was going to produce at the kraal
of the chief-comedy or tragedy

three days passed and isaacs
was without word of dixon his
native servants and the natives
of the kraals were also without
information for once the bush telegraph
was silent the big signal drums at misongwe
did not answer to the querulous tapping
queries from the smaller kraals-they were
mutes still more disturbing to isaacs was
the fact that the two messengers he had sent
to bring him word of dixon had not re-
turned

  isaacs was badly worried and when in the
late afternoon of the third day word came
to him that the messenger he had sent to
inyati was held up by a flooding river he
resolved to put an end to his idle conjectures
by riding over to misongwe and finding out
for himself just what was what

  once his mind was made up it did not
adventure

take him long to act five minutes later-
he had changed from his clean white duck
suit to garments which exaggerated his
physical imperfections-he was riding a big
raw-boned mule toward misongwe

  he came to the corn patches of the large
kraal just about half an hour before sun-
down and the kraal itself was in sight just
a few minutes later it was built close
against the walls of a precipitous kopje and
was practically impregnable from attack
except from the front two or three hun-
dred yards from the kraal-about midway
between it and the edge of the corn patches
-was a large tent it was not in line with
the path leading to the kraal but quite
some distance to the right of it

  isaacs after reining in a moment trying
to determine his course headed for the tent
as he got nearer he saw that a hundred
more or less of the porters were working
frantically with pick and shovel they
were he saw digging a long trench which
curved back slightly at both ends toward
the kraal this trench when finished
isaacs saw judging by the markers stuck
into the ground would cover the front of
the kraal

  never heard of any ancient buildings
following that line isaacs mused ah
veil- oy i vonder vot thats for

  a report broke the silence a little puff of
dirt sprang up just to the right of him

  looking up he saw a native waving his
arm frantically and pointing away from the
tent

  isaacs shrugged his shoulder

  it seems as if they dont vant to see me
he muttered veil im not so sure i vant
to see them--yet

  he changed his course and presently
came to the gate in the pole stockade which
surrounded the kraal

  it was guarded by two natives--porters
of the expedition-armed with modern
rifles but not a native of the kraal was
present

  you cant go in one of the guards said
in the dialect of the district when he tried
to ride past them

  why he asked quietly

  it is an order

  but i have business with the chief
macombe he expostulated and again
spurred forward

  one of the guards caught hold of his
bridle reins and exerting all his strength

backed the mule the beast reared then
toppled over as the guard gave it a cunning
push isaacs only just managed to squirm
out of the way of its flying hoofs then sat
up stupidly and watched the mule regain
its feet and gallop swiftly away

  the storekeeper rose sadly to his feet and
turned away from the gate intending to en-
circle the stockade in the hope of finding
a weak place where he could scramble
through or over

  then he saw that sentries had been posted
at intervals all around the stockade

  isaacs sighed loudly

  and why so gloomy senhor store-
keeper

  isaacs jumped round with a frightened
squeal to face the man gonzales who had
come quietly up behind him

  oy how you frightened me i vant to
get in there and your niggers vont let me
gonzales laughed

  it is my orders-theyre good soldiers
they obey

  but vhy mister it aint right youll
ruin my business i have to go an arrange

a deal with old macombe an-

  is that all you came over for gon-
zales asked sharply

  nunno i also vanted to have a talk
with that policeman fellow he owes me
money he bought some goods from me
three days ago and promised he vould re-
turn the next day and pay an he didnt
so i come over here to see if he vas here it
vas here he said he vas coming

  he came here gonzales said slowly
but he only stayed an hour or so then

he rode off-

  oy isaacs wrung his hands ill be
ruined these policemen are all alike they
alvays grin and promise to pay tomorrow
-only they never do but vhy do you
have men with guns every where mister
the niggers at the kraal were insolent-
they refused to help me dig and some of
them have been stealing our stores so
to punish them ive forbidden them to
leave their kraal for five days

  isaacs nodded

  thats the vay to treat em mister i
vish i had the nerve to do things like that
i vouldnt keep a store very long then
gonzales sneered and turned away

  say mister isaacs ran after him and
clutched at his sleeve with a grimy paw
my mule he ran away and i vont be able
-and of gideon



to get back to the store can i stay with
you for the night 

  you can sleep with my niggers-if
theyll have you but i dont think they
will

  thats no way to treat a white man
mister isaacs expostulated i couldnt
sleep vith niggers anyvay veil then sell
me a horse or a mule i cant stay on the
veld all night-ill get sick an theres
lions an you vont let me go in the kraal
-please mister

  gonzales brought the butt of his sjambok
down on isaacs fingers

  no he roared now get to your
sty-walk-run-get there anyway you
please but dont let me see you around
here understand

  he did not wait to hear the storekeepers
mumbled yes mister but walked swiftly
away toward the tent

  isaacs sucking his bruised knuckles
stared at the broad back of the portuguese
and scowled at the mans brutal swagger

  oy he sighed i aint no better off
than vot i vas before i came-save that i
know vot before i only thought but how
they think theyre going to pull it off-
thats vot i cant even imagine maybe
id better start back for the store and
mind my own business i aint got noth-
ing to do with the british government i
aint on their pay sheet its none of my
business if the portuguese grabs ma-
combes country

  but isaacs knew that it was decidedly his
business to see that the natives of the dis-
trict should be accorded good treatment
he had been their wise counsellor and friend
for too many years to back out now they
had come to lean on him were ready to pay
him a greater homage than they did their
chief he couldnt desert them now-at
least not to the portuguese the adminis-
tration of that countrys colonies was not
the sort of thing he wished to see duplicated
here

  oh - he muttered glad the

missioner aint here im goin to curse a
lot tonight maybe if i hurry ill catch
up with that fool mule cant stand here
no longer im afraid of that gonzales
an me with no revolver oy vot a fool
i am

  he started back along the trail at a slow
lope again making a sweeping detour to
avoid the camp of the expedition

  he found his mule standing quietly under
a kaffir orange tree just beyond the fringe
of the first corn patch and tethering it se-
curely he sat down to wait for darkness and
the distorted shadows that would flicker
about the ground when the moon rose

  the sun set for a little while there was
profound darkness then the moon rose
it was nearly at the full and isaacs left the
protecting shelter of the corn and crept
toward the tent

it took him nearly two hours
to cover the four hundred odd
yards but each foot of his prog-
ress had to be taken with infinite
care where possible he followed the shal-
low ravines which broke the contour of the
ground where that was not feasible he
sprawled prone upon the veld seemed to
flow into it to become a part of it in some
uncanny way he seemed able to constrict
his body so that it conformed to the smallest
of the lacey shadows which dotted the veld
whenever he moved-it was forward

  it was masterly work-there were few
natives who could have done it so well
isaacs didnt know whether any night watch
was kept at the camp or where it was
posted actually gonzales was trusting to
the sentries about the kraal he didnt
fear danger from any other source but
even if there had been sentries-alert sen-
tries at that-it is very doubtful if they
could have spotted isaacs

  peering under the flap of the tent isaacs
could see dixon lying on the floor he was
bound hand and foot and gagged near
him was the fat porcine figure of the old
chief macombe the man gonzales was
seated on a cot bed-a bottle of gin in his
hand he was watching dandra clumsily
attempt to assemble something which glit-
tered evilly in the light of the kerosene lamp

  every once in a while when dandra
would stop and groan wearily as he looked
at his broken nails and grease-smeared
hands the sjambok would quiver in gon-
zales hand and the cutting lash would lap
itself about dandras thin legs this was
followed by shrill threats and entreaties
which were answered by sneering laughs

  isaacs could see no sign of the rotund
baldheaded little professor but he had
seen enough he had seen soldiers digging
a trench in an excellent strategical position
and soldiers on guard at the kraal he had
adventure

seen dixon and the chief macombe both
prisoners and he had seen dandra assem-
bling a machine gun

  for a fraction of a second he entertained
the wild thought of attempting a rescue
right then second thoughts and better
judgment however vetoed the plan he
knew that such a move would be suicidal-
even if he were armed the chances against
success were too heavy as it was-

  he returned to his mule-his course was
just as cautious but infinitely swifter-
mounted and rode slowly away until he
judged himself to be well out of earshot
then he spurred his mule into a speed it
had not thought itself capable of

  on isaacs rode

 and then-

  he must have been completely immersed
in his thoughts the mule must have been
so completely surprized out of its normal
obstinate self by isaacs constant spurring
that it forgot all its traditional fears

  at any rate they passed through a herd of
elephants-coming so close that the toe
of isaacs left boot grazed the leg of one
of the beasts-on their way to raid the
corn patches of misongwe

  and the marvel of it is that the great
gray ghosts of the bush ignored the mule
and its rider with contemptuous indiffer-
ence

  isaacs must have seen them must have
got their scent and heard their intestinal
rumblings but he was not consciously
aware of them yet in his mental imagery
at that moment gonzales and dandra
assumed the shapes of elephants and were
trampling the life out of the people of the
district-wantonly laying everything to
waste

mnminr it was sunrise when isaacs
reaced his store he was so full
of the plan which he had evolved
 during his ride from misongwe
that he was not conscious of any feeling of
fatigue all he required was a shower a
brisk rub down a change of clothes and
then-

  his eyes sparkled his plan must suc-
ceed he did not dare to think of failure

  he had just sat down to a hearty break-
fast when miles rode up to the store and
rushed into the skoff hut he wore a long
black cassock a large gold cross hung on a
black ribbon about his neck swung to and

fro-agitated by his rapid breathing it
reflected the bright sun rays which streamed
through the open doorway

  vot is it missioner isaacs asked
calmly making no comment on the fact
that miles in striking contrast to his peace
uniform carried a rifle in his hand and
wore a heavy cartridge belt about his waist

  matter miles cried excitedly why
the professor came to the mission yesterday
just before sundown the poor old chap
had got lost and the fever caught him un-
prepared he told me a lot of things-
such as-that dixon and the chief
macombe had been captured and held as
prisoners by gonzales isaacs interrupted
dryly that their porters are really sol-
diers-that theyve dug a big trench at
misongwe and that theyve got maxims
is that it

  yes miles assented wonderingly but
how do you know all this

  i have eyes missioner ive got brains
i vent to misongwe yesterday and saw all
them things for myself

  and they let you they didnt try to
stop you

  i didnt go through the formality of
asking their permission isaacs said with a
chuckle

  but i dont see how you can sit there so
calmly and eat--

  vot is your hurry missioner by hur-
rying you vill do no good you aint had
breakfast yet-no then sit down an eat
a man thinks better when his bellys full
thats better he continued as miles seated
himself and reluctantly accepted a cup of
coffee which one of isaacs servants offered
him now tell me is there anything
else you know which i dont know did
the professor tell you vot little game gon-
zales and dandra are playing

  he doesnt really know i think the
little he knows is what he overheard today
before he left misongwe to explore in the
hills about the mission but from what he
said i gather that theyve got a concession
which macombe signed years and years ago
and they plan to fortify themselves and
then holding macombe as hostage for the
nativesi good behavior theyre going to
notify the british authorities that theyve
annexed the territory on behalf of portugal
its a clever plan and if we dont do some-
thing it may succeed once theyve fin-
ished their fortifications theyll be able to
-and of gideon



withstand a long siege-long enough at
least for portugal to present their case to
the hague tribunal

  yes isaacs agreed i dont yet see
how theyre going to carry their plan
through--an thats no matter the only
thing that counts with us is that theyre
dangerous they do bad things to our people
but vhy does the professor tell you the
plans of his countrymen

  he didnt really tell me all this big un
he didnt know what he was saying-he
was half-delirious with fever hes afraid
of those two men hes afraid they will kill
him-he was horrified by the way gonzales
beats the natives but-i-i dont think
he would have told anything if it had not
been for the fever

  veil you can let your conscience rest
easy i knew all that he has told you-ex-
cept about the concession an that doesnt
count much anyvays vot weve got to do
missioner is put gonzales and dandra
vhere they cant do no harm an itll be a
hard job missioner they have two ma-
chine guns perhaps more an a hundred an
fifty native soldiers who can shoot-unless
the one who fired at me tried to hit me
we can do it miles said stoutly the
lord is on our side his eyes glowed with
fanatical fervor he will not give this
land which is his vineyard into tks hand
of those despicable creatures

  how arc you going to do it isaacs
asked abruptly

  the sword of the lord-miles began
but isaacs interrupted him

  never mind that missioner-vot are
you going to do

  last night i sent a messenger to all the
kraals telling them what was happening
at misongwe and telling the warriors to
come to the mission that we might make

plans--

  good isaacs exclaimed how many
came

  twelve hundred-young men and old-
armed with spears and knobkerries-all
ready to strike a blow for the right

  isaacs smiled sadly at miles demonstra-
tion of fervor

  veil he asked and vot are you
going to do now

  im going to lead them to misongwe-
it will be a crusade we shall attack the
force of gonzales and we shall win because
the sword of the lord-

  vith one machine gun alone they could
wipe out your crusaders isaacs com-
mented

  the missionary laughed scornfully
youre afraid he said youre think-
ing of your precious skin youre too con-
cerned in thinking of- he broke off
suddenly as isaacs chuckled then im
sorry big un i shouldnt talk that way
i ought to know better-im still very
much of a fool i am afraid

  sure you are isaacs agreed cheerfully
you just imagine yourself marching at the
head of the warriors to misongwe and ex-
pect to vin just by showing yourselves it
vould be nice if it could be like that-but
that aint the vay itll have to be done
weve got to be cunning-very cunning
you mean that we should wait for dark
ness and make a surprize attack miles
said slowly but wre dont dare wait
big un any moment they may take it
into their heads to do something dreadful
or the natives at misongwe may try to res-
cue their chief and then thered be frightful
bloodshed i think my ways better than
that

  miles was still lost in the glorious idea of
leading his crusaders to victory

  maybe isaacs admitted but in a
vay youre right i vas thinking myself of
a surprize attack-but not just vith your
men

  you mean that we must wait for rein-
forcements-you need a bigger army
yes isaacs giggled slightly itll
be bigger-much bigger

  but we cant wait too long miles
said fearfully not more than two or
three days at the most

  listen isaacs said patiently ve
could almost afford to wait until troops
came from inyati i vould vait only im
afraid as you say that the natives will try
to rescue macombe by themselves and im
afraid the big fellow dixon vill say some-
thing that vill make gonzales mad-and
then thered be  more dixon so ve
vont wait vell start at once but you
armys too big

too big miles echoed incredulously
sure youll understand in a little
while-only youve got to trust me now
vhere did you leave this army of yours
the warriors are all down at the foot of
the hill-

  you vas a fool to leave them so far avay


adventure

they vont like vaiting down there all
alone theyll begin to think things-
theyll begin to think of death an that
vont be nice some of them vill remember
that they have vork to do at their kraals-
but no matter come on you come and
mutter charms-or prayers vot does it
matter which-while im making the army
smaller

  he rose and leaving the store went down
the hill to where the warriors summoned so
hastily by miles had congregated and
miles nervously fingering his gold cross
followed silently behind him listening to the
plan isaacs unfolded as he walked

  when they got down to the level ground
at the foot of the hill they saw that isaacs
fears were well justified small groups of
natives were already returning to their
kraals indecision and doubtful fears was
plainly evident on the faces of the others
they had heard a great deal of the power of
the guns with many voices and they were
beginning to doubt the wisdom of the course
the missionary had incited them to follow
after all they knew very little of miles
he had not lived in the district long enough
for his influence to hold when he was not
actually with them

  but when they saw isaacs all fears  t
them and they shouted his name and
crowded about him the little groups who
had left the main body halted at the sound
of isaacs name turned then came running
back-pretending that they were new ar-
rivals hoping that he had not witnessed
their desertion the little storekeeper they
knew he had proved himself time and
time again if he was to lead what need
had they to fear

  and so those who had been ready to re-
turn to their kraals were now in the front
ranks of those who crowded about isaacs
and miles and of all those who pleaded to
be led at once against the white men who
had dared to make their chief prisoner
their voices were the loudest

  sap isaacs climbed on to a rock and
held up his hands for silence
cmij i have little to say his voice
boomed out you know why
the umfundisi asked you to arm yourselves
it is to drive out of this land the white
men who have acted like rogue elephants
there is no need for me to talk of that the
umfundisi has told you also that the men

have with them many black dogs with guns
-aye they have too the guns of many
voices you know that if we go up against
them you will meet death not one will

escape

  au-a they cried we will be content
to die if you lead us

  will your deaths help macombe fools
isaacs asked scathingly

  maybe storekeeper a young buck
shouted maybe one out of all the war-
riors here will live long enough to reach the
heart of the white man-with-the-whip
with an assegai

  ah there speaks a warrior isaacs
shouted but that is not my way of doing
things

  listen i have made a charm which
will bring us victory aye it is a strong
charm and it is jealous of its power it
may be that alone it could gain the victory
-of that i am not sure but sure i am
that you are too many less than half of
you-au-a less than a quarter of you-with
them shall victory be gained

  now look into your hearts-remember-
ing that the charm i have made is all power-
ful and hates liars-and those of you who
find fear there let them depart to their
kraals and there shall be no shame this
thing that we do is of the spirits and who
shall jeer when the great ones work

  the warriors stirred uneasily but none
spoke presently some of them elbowed
their way out some of those on the fringe
of the army moved apart three hundred
warriors in all left the main body broke up
into smaller groups and hastened along the
paths leading to their kraals from one of
these a young warrior dashed back it was
the one who had said maybe one of us
will live long enough to stick an assegai in
the heart of the-man-with-the-whip 

  i am not afraid of death storekeeper
he shouted it was fear of the charm
which you work that took my feet away
from you

  good isaacs boomed now all of
you raise one hand above your heads-you
are still too many the charm tells me to
make still further choice

  a forest of arms shot into the air

  good now each of you look to the
hand that is in the air and those among you
whose fist is clenched-those men shall go
to the right the others shall go to the left
is it understood
-and of gideon



  aye they answered and immediately
began milling about sorting themselves
according to his orders

  soon it was done and two groups of war-
riors faced isaacs waiting expectantly
and those on the right the men who had
clenched their fists numbered about five
hundred to the others isaacs said

  i have no need of you-get to your
kraals hasten we waste much time
they obeyed him silently swiftly

  you are still too many isaacs said to
those who were left the charm is strong
the charm is jealous follow me

  climbing down from the rock he led the
way to the river

  drink he said and watched closely
miles also closely scrutinized each war-
rior as he came to drink

  soon all had satisfied their thirst-all ex-
cept the young warrior and he was about
to do so

  and now isaacs cried those of you
who took the water up in your hands get
together in one place those of you who put
your heads down to the water get to an-
other

  and then the young warrior who had not
yet quenched his thirst but stood listening
to isaacs commands his face lined with
thought stooped down and bringing water
up to his mouth in his cupped hands drank
his eyes fixed on isaacs

  why did you drink that way warrior
isaacs asked softly

  it came to me that that is the way the
charm would have warriors drink store-
keeper by drinking so my eyes are open
to see all that goes on about me had i put
my face down to the water an enemy might
have come up behind unseen and- he
chuckled-i should not have had need of
water again also it came to me the
charm selected those men whose fists were

clenched because-

  that is enough warrior isaacs inter-
rupted sternly yet his eyes twinkled go
and join those who drank as you drank but
remember the charm also likes those who
keep a still tongue

  then to those who had put their heads
down to the water isaacs said

  get you to your kraals the charm has
no need of you go-remembering that
there is no shame

  and when the had gone he turned to the
men who were left-three hundred of them

full of confidence had they not been
selected by the charm who could stand
against them-and divided them into two
companies in one company which he
placed under the command of miles there
were one hundred men the other two
hundred strong looked to him for orders

  now sleep if you wish isaacs ordered
the time is not yet at hand

  you see isaacs said softly to miles
there is no fear in them if you vas to
give the order they vould march with you

to attack - an that aint swearin

neither missioner

  miles nodded

  yes they would follow me he agreed
if you ordered them to ive got a lot to
learn isaacs sometimes- he sighed-
im afraid im never learn

  you aint got nothing to grumble at
missioner youre learnin all the time
but youre too old yet to know these people
as i know them theyre only kids an
you must be like a kid if you want to under-
stand them y got to grow younger mis-
sioner thats all course had you stayed
with them you might have held em just
vith that big gold cross of yours-maybe
not no i think not before these peo-
ple believe in charms they vant to see
vonders worked by that charm now they
think my charm selected em an they know
the charm picked veil they dont stop
to think that i could have picked me men
just as veil vithout all that mumbojumbo
sure missioner if id have counted em
out-eenie meenie minee mo- that d
have held em better than the cross vifiout
any mystery talk

  an now he yawned and stretched his
hands high above his head im goin to
sleep i vas trekking all last night an
you had better sleep too

  no i cant sleep isaacs im too
worried i still dont see how what youre
planning to do will help us

  tchat isaacs clicked impatiently
never mind about me and vot im
a-goin to do you make sure you know vot
you are to do you see missioner it
may be that we could pull off vot we vant
to do vithout the help of my big army-
he chuckled softly-on the other hand
maybe not an we cant afford to take
chances remember theyve got a dis-
ciplined force an rifles an maxims-not to
mention a good position you know the


adventure

lay of the land about misongwe dont
you

  miles nodded

  veil you know that thick patch of
bush to the right after you come through
the corn patch

  again miles nodded

  i ought to ive held service on the
rising ground there a lot of times-used the
bush as a sort of vestry put my cassock
and surplice on you know

  isaacs smiled

  veil you goin to hold another sort
of service there tonight listen gonzales
and dandra have pitched their tent not
far from the bush all right then youll
take your men and hide yourself in that
bush youll have to plan your trek so as
youll get there after sun set and before the
moon rises and youll vait there until
things begin to happen

  but if we get so close why cant we at-
tack at once

  because isaacs exclaimed wearily
oh - - missioner dont be so foony
theyll have sentries posted maybe and
theyve got guns an maxims an your
crossll only stop a bullet if it gets in the
vay of one an even if you vun in the
end first a lot of men vould die no
youll vait until i make things happen an
then when theyre all busy lookin at me
then you can attack-if theres any need
to he added as an afterthought

  miles frowned doubtfully

  youll promise to obey orders mis-
sioner isaacs said fiercely or ill make
you stay behind

  of course ill obey isaacs miles said
hastily but how long will we have to wait
supposing your plan fails what then
youll vait until just before sun rise an
if i aint come by that time you an the
cross can do things your own vay but
you vont have to vait that long now go
away and let me sleep call me at noon
with that isaacs curled up into a ball and
in a few moments was snoring loudly

  but miles was far from sleep and he
paced nervously up and down until startled
by an indignant grunt he looked down into
the sleep filled reproachful eyes of one of
the natives

  he made a gesture of apology then and
sat down on a near-by boulder the native
sighed contentedly closed his eyes and
slept again

  time passed

  miles eyes roved continually from one
sleeping form to another he held grimly on
to his gold cross as if seeking to gain con-
fidence and courage from it

  something moved in the undergrowth
back of him he picked up his rifle and
turned quickly just in time to see a bush-pig
vanish into the deep bush shadows he
laughed softly at the memories the pig
had conjured up then he occupied himself
with examining the mechanism of his rifle

  he sighed placed his rifle carefully on the
ground beside him and fingered the cross
again	

  miles head wagged he slid off the rock
on to the ground he edged around a little
to get into the shade of the rock his eyes
closed

  miles slept one hand closed firmly on the
stock of his rifle the other on the cross
which hung from his neck his face ex-
pressed the great contentment which goes
with a complete confidence in a plan to
be followed

he awakened some hours
later and smiled into the face
of isaacs who was standing over
him

  the natives were standing eagerly about
looking at him with impatience

  is it time that we started he stam-
mered i have been asleep i didnt
mean to

  sure you slept isaacs chuckled an
you must have the conscience of a two-year-
old missioner you avakened so easy-
like yes its time that ve vent-to eat

  eat miles echoed incredulously

  sure these men still have bellies
missioner an some of em may not eat
again after tonight come

  he led the way back to the store where his
boys had prepared vast quantities of mealie-
meal and boiled chicken for the natives

  ve vill eat too isaacs said and led the
missionary into the skoff hut ignoring his
frowns at the gourds of beer with which the
natives were washing down their food

  an hour later the two white men left
the hut and found that the natives too had
finished their skoff and were passing the
time in rough horse-play and the telling
qf jokes which were as primitive as their
dress one group was singing a mission
hymn-tune and miles beamed approval
-and of gideon



until he caught the sense of the words they
were singing to it and then his blue eyes
flashed coldly his muscles tensed

  i said they were children isaacs said
quietly and miles relaxed he grinned
sheepishly

  it is time we go isaacs shouted and
at the sound of his booming voice the horse-
play ceased the song ended in a discordant
quaver the point of a joke remained untold
without further word they divided them-
selves as isaacs had divided them at the
river-two hundred on one side a hundred
on the other

  the umfundisi leads you isaacs said
to the hundred obey him in all things
my children is it understood

  truly they shouted he is your
mouthpiece we hear and we obey

  you understand vot youre to do mis-
sioner

  miles nodded

 all right take em along make

yourselves as invisible as possible-an dont
let em sing anything good luck

  the two men clasped hands and then the
missionary firmly gripping his rifle led
his band down the hill

  as soon as they had disappeared around
a bend in the trail isaacs had his men line
up and addressed them in short pithy
sentences telling them exactly the part they
were to play the softly intoned au-a
the clicks of admiration which punctuated
his discourse satisfied him that they fully
understood his plan and approved of it

  his face glowed with pleasure his eyes
sparkled behind the strong-lensed glasses
he wore isaacs had chosen his men well
many of them were old experienced hunt-
ers the rest were of the hunting breed lack-
ing only the experience which comes with
age to make them the equal of the others

  to each of the younger ones he gave a
can-kerosene can small wash-basin large
empty fruit tin-any kind of can which
was large enough to make a noise when
beaten upon with a stick

  and then ready now to put his plan into
execution isaacs led his men down the
hillside

  coming out on to the broad valley below
the men divided into parties of ten an old
hunter in charge of each and vanished
noiselessly into the bush

  isaacs with another ten continued along
the trail in single file until presently they

too left the trail and became lost in the
dense bush but this maneuver was not
to seek shelter or to mask their advance
from possible scouts of the portuguese
isaacs and his two hundred men were comb-
ing the bush looking for the recruits to
their army

  they advanced very slowly noiselessly
and spread out so that they covered a wide
front yet near enough so that they kept in
touch with each other

 j once a peculiar cry sounded far
azffith to the right of them isaacs
answered it and it was repeated
far to their left again the cry
sounded and isaacs men changed their
course slightly bearing toward the direction
from which the cry first came

 on they went stopped now by a bad
piece of thorn scrub now by a tall patch
of flesh-tearing spear grass once they
halted and conversed in excited whispers
about a stout tree the bark of which had
been worn smooth at a height of fifteen feet
from the ground again an uprooted
mimosa tree-its sap was still running--
aroused their interest and after they had
gravely inspected it and the immense
smoking animal droppings which littered
the ground thereabouts isaacs gave the
signal cry heard it repeated to- the left and
the right of him then cautiously followed
the track which was clearly marked in the
bush-as clearly as if a huge steam roller
had gone before them

- just before sundown they heard noises
ahead of them-the snapping of trees and
loud rumblings-the bello wings of an ele-
phant

 their progress became even slower and
infinitely more cautious not a step was
made before the bush ahead was carefully
scanned and before a forward step re-
ceived the weight of the body the ground
was tested they dared not risk at this
time the cracking of a twig underfoot

 yet even so isaacs-and few natives
excelled his trekking ability-nearly walked
into a big bull standing motionless under
a spreading-branched baobab tree the big
fellow had looked like one of the gray bush
shadows he seemed to be unaware of the
presence of humans and as they waited
breathlessly hoping that the wind would not
suddenly change its direction he filled his
trunk with dirt and sprayed it over his back


adventure

  it sounded like a mighty wind rushing in
to fill some suddenly created vacuum
then he moved steadily off his big ears
flopping his head moving majestically up
and down save for an occasional crack-
ing as he wantonly stripped branches from
the trees and an intermittent voiding of
wind the bulls progress was noiseless
as noiseless as that of the puny mortals
who followed dangerously close at his heels

  soon isaacs and his men came to the edge
of a large clearing which sloped gently to a
muddy pool and there they saw a herd
of cows with their calves and young bull
elephants wallowing happily in the mud
other elephants old bulls all of them though
none were as big as the one isaacs men had
been following were leaving the bush at
various points and converging on the pool
as each one joined the herd he was greeted
by the shrill effeminate trumpeting of the
cows one young bull ventured to dispute
the way to the big bull of the herd and the
two massive heads came together with a
thunderous impact

  the cows squealed a baby calf ran and
sought protection under its mothers belly
its trunk curling up seeking at this moment
of fear courage from its mothers milk
the other bulls huddled together and looked
sagely on but the fight was already over
that one impact was enough for the young-
ster and he turned sheepishly away broke
into a shuffling trot and squealed with fear
when the big bull trumpted and feinted to
charge him

  the victor rocked back and forth-the 
others moved uneasily and there was an air
of unrest over the whole herd until the big
tuskers ears flopped lazily and turning his
back to the others got down on his knees
and wallowed luxuriously

  isaacs moved impatiently forward but
stopped as a grizzled native placed a re-
straining hand on his arm

  we must wait master the old one
said this is their place and we can not
hurry them from it when the moon rises
will be time enough see the others
wait

  the gray beard and the natives who were
with him squatted down on their haunches

  isaacs looked to the right and the left
he sensed rather than saw that this side of
the clearing was fringed by his men all
waiting patiently all realizing that to go
slow is often the best speed realizing that

when elephants want to play nothing short
of a stampede will move them and a
stampede was not at this time in keeping
with isaacs plan

  so he shrugged his shoulders resignedly
and squatted down beside the gray beard

  the spirits are with us master the
charm works the old one said whispering
as if he were afraid the big beast would hear
and understand him some day-very
soon-the madness will come upon the big
tusker and then the herd will not rest until
he is killed i thought the time had come
when he fought the young one if it had
all our cunning would have been to no
avail

  time passed the sun set the western
sky flamed red-then darkness came

  down by the water the tragedies and
comedies of elephant life continued to the
waiting men came gargantuan sounds as if
the earth labored in the far distance a low
rumbling noise as of thunder sounded and
an elephant trumpted in shrill derision of
the lions hunting note the distant rum-
bling faded away a strong breeze laden with
the pungent odor of elephants stung the
mens nostrils and died down again as
quickly as it had risen 

  behind in the bush a heavy tread the
smashing down of bushes a frightened
bleating note alarmed the men a gigan-
tic black shadow loomed up out of the dark-
ness and rushed by them nearly treading
on isaacs

  he cursed softly then laughed as the gray
beard explained-

  it is a young cow-she was lost listen
they are laughing at her

  from the darkness below sounded gur-
gling chuckling noises

  the moon rose swiftly making of the
landscape an etching in black and white
shadows moved and mysteriously vanished
the elephants down in the hollow milled
about uneasily in the cold white light
they appeared like fantastic shapes of a
nightmare their fanning ears looked like
wings their searching tusks like gigantic
snakes

         they lined up suddenly facing
tle ne heaters their right
i	torees swinging in an attitude of

          indecision several of the bulls
advanced slowly stopped a few paces more
stopped the biggest tusker of them all
-and of gideon



came on alone advanced to within twenty
feet of where isaacs squatted then stopped
and peered uneasily before him

  theyve got our scent isaacs muttered
were beat if something doesnt turn em
look master there goes one who has
a plan

  the gray beard pointed to a tiny figure
running swiftly across the open he passed
perilously near to the main body of the
herd but the elephants seemed unconscious
of his presence they were too absorbed
in the hidden menace before them

  isaacs watched the man gain the high
ground opposite and there busy himself
running about in an apparently aimless
ant-like fashion

  presently a tiny spark of flame appeared
the gray beard chuckled he lights a
fire he said he is very wise watch
now master and listen

  the flame grew larger a faint shout
echoed across the valley a shout and the
banging of wood on tin it was a sacrile-
gious noise the voice of a puny mortal de-
riding the gods

  the elephants turned about the man
was dancing fantastically about the fire-
shouting insults beating the tin can which
hung from his neck

  the bull elephants moved forward took
their position at the head of the herd-went
forward again - quicker-quicker - broke
into their pace-deceiving shuffle trumpeted
loudly and charged at the fire at the sound
at the dancing figure

  they flowed over and around the fire
then passed on into the bush beyond the
menace had passed the fire was out the
noise ceased the dancing figure had dis-
appeared they forgot the other menace
the scent which had first aroused their
suspicions ahead were sweet hunger-
satisfying mealie crops belly hunger as-
serted itself

  isaacs and his thin line of beaters surged
triumphantly forward over the muddy
pool up into the bush beyond

 that one was a man-his name his
deed must not be forgotten isaacs said

  it will not be the gray beard chuckled
he will never weary of telling the story
but we shall weary of its telling

  he is dead-it is not well to jest of such
a brave one old man

  he lives master see

  a man stepped out from behind a large tree

in front of them he had run to it and hidden
behind its thick trunk when the elephants
had charged they had poured past him
to the right and to the left a gray ponder-
ous flood of death but not one had turned
toward him not one had seen him

  im a hunter he boasted

  when the hunt is over-then talk
the gray beard said curtly

they went on in silence keep-
ing close to the herd the ele-
phants were moving leisurely
now yet the men had to run to
keep up with them at times only the
noise ahead told them of the herds proxim-
ity at times they got so close that by
stretching out a hand they could have
touched the hindmost yet because of the
thick hush growth which the moons ray
could not pierce were unable to see them

  again where the bush was thin they saw
the beasts moving forward with effortless
grace and ease-silent shadows of anight
of shadows and once after topping a
slight rise they came suddenly face to face
with the herd for a full minute men and
mammoths seemed frozen into statues
carved from the bush-then the elephants
wheeled ponderously and continued their
journey

  with the cunning of sheep dogs driving
a flock of sheep silently not pressing too
hard for fear the herd would break back or
stampede and lose its cohesion isaacs and
his men followed and so clever was their
hunting craft that the herds suspicions
were being continually aroused-and al-
layed-until it was evident that any overt
demonstration would turn their food-seek-
ing march into a devastating stampede

  and so in due course they came to the
mealie patches which were before misongwe

i shall make you pay some-
time for the way you have treated
me senhor gonzales dandra
said slowly

  the two men were seated outside their
tent the moon was high there was an
atmosphere of peace about the place from
the long trench to the right of the tent came
happy snatches of song and boisterous
laughter it drowned the groans which
came from within the tent

  gonzales his eyes inflamed his hands
unsteady gulped down another drink


adventure

  at least he said contemptuously i
have done my best to make a man of you
you are not so pretty as you were-no
but soon this will be ended and you will go
back to lourenco marques and forget all
that i have taught you

  you have taught me nothing dandra
said sullenly you have treated me as if
i were a nigger you have made me work

with my hands-

  gonzales laughed

  let that pass you on your part have
been like a fool you disobeyed my com-
mands twice you nearly ruined our mis-
sion by that blatting tongue of yours and
so i had to punish you i could not sjam-
bok you as i do the niggers you cry too
easily but soon all this will be over
there is no need now for caution we are
in an impregnable position you will be

promoted to a high position and-

  and i shall not forget to make you pay
for the misery you have caused me
dandra said wrathfully

 - stop snivelling and drink to

success the trench works are finished-
we have enough provisions to last a long
siege should the english try to oust us be-
fore the diplomats are through with their
wordy war copies of the concession are
on the way to the two governments and a
messenger goes tomorrow from macombe
asking our government to assume a pro-
tectorate over his country

  he laughed brutally

  my little arguments which i used to
persuade macombe were excellent werent
they a nail torn off is very powerful as a
persuader-that is an excellent argument-
and one has always twenty such arguments
at ones disposal presented slowly the
arguments are unanswerable it is rarely
necessary to advance more than five of
them macombe- he laughed again-
was obstinate

  dandra shivered

  you are a beast gonzales the way

you have treated me-

  still whining about yourself eh bah
another word and i will treat you as i
treated macombe he drank again you
have nothing to whine about i permit you
to have all the glory i allow you to take

charge of the concession and-

 my - whats that dandra

leaped to his feet

  gonzales laughed

  its only an elephant trumpeting fool
they will make good hunting for me the
ivory they carry will pay me well for the
trouble of this expedition that is all the
concession i want

  a mass of clouds veiled the moon

  tomorrow he continued we will cut
down the mealie patches an army could
hide there still- he shrugged his shoul-
ders-before it got to us it would have to
cross that bare land where there is no cover
-butwhich we could cover with a leaden
mantel of death

  the clouds passed but others were coming
up fast

  the two men could see huge gray forms
in the mealie patch they moved like the
flickering fantasies of a nightmare the air
was filled with strange gargantuan noises

  the tuskers are feeding well gonzales
chuckled maybe i wont have to bother
about cutting down the mealies after all

  more clouds drifted across the moon
when they had passed and all was light
again the two could see three-four-five
elephants standing before the mealie patch
they were swaying their heads uncertainly
their enormous ears were spread out wide
their trunks curved upward

  get me my rifle gonzales ordered
curtly im going to give them a warning
to steer clear of here

  but before dandra could move a terrific
din arose-a clamor of shouting voices the
beating of tin cans-the firing of guns

  one of the elephants at the edge of the
clearing trumpeted loudly and was an-
swered by the bugling of others

  and then with surprising suddenness the
five big bulls charged forward followed by
the gray devastating avalanche of the rest
of the herd-the earth shook to their pon-
derous tread

  - gonzales roared to the soldiers

in the trenches fire-before they are
on us

  but his voice was unheard in the con-
fusion

  here and there a soldier fired into the on-
rushing horde and then yelling with fear
threw away his rifle and joined in the head-
long flight of his comrades

 - gonzales roared again my

rifle dandra but that man had van-
ished

  gonzales turned to enter his tent intend-
ing to get his rifle then he realized that he
-and of gideon



had delayed too long that nothing he could
do would stop this stampede and he lurched
drunkenly in the direction of the kraal curs-
ing and blaspheming

  once he turned - the elephants had
reached the trench it had stopped them
they were milling about it exploring its
depth with their trunks

  he slowed down to a walk stopped and
turned to watch them he saw one pick up
a machine gun and toss it into the air he
saw his tent collapse as a big tusker barged
into it and he grinned as he thought of the
two bound men he had left in it their
deaths would make things easier for him
they-

  and then with a curse he turned and ran
again the big bull was coming on scream-
ing with rage maddened by a piece of can-
vas which flapped about its ears

  gonzales ran on cursing praying his
feet felt like lead his heart pounded rapidly
-his eyes closed-he rolled in his gait

  the heavy pounding behind him sounded
closer and closer

  he glanced over his shoulder in a frenzy
of fear

  - he shrieked

  and then a swinging blow knocked him
headlong-the weight of death dropped
heavily on him

  a report sounded crisply above the clamor
another shot

  the big bull rose from his knees-the
moonlight glinted on its blood-stained tusks
-then toppled slowly over

  the clouds closed in it began to rain

         it was early morning
mm the children of the kraal were
i mlri swarming about the body of the
dead bull the women were
mournfully examining then trampled mealie
patches the men were crowding about their
chief acclaiming his decision to ask the
british to assume a protectorate over
them

  dixon was superintending the roping to-
gether of the soldiers who had been the
porters of the expedition four of them
led by the young warrior had rushed to
the rescue of macombe just before the big
bull crashed into the tent

  and i aint a bit sorry isaacs said-he
and miles were seated on the ground their
backs against the pole stockade of the kraal
-i killed the tusker too late to save gon-

  

zales sure it vas a-of a vay to die

-but hej deserved it

  miles nodded

  just the same isaacs continued with a
chuckle he must have been a smart
man to have caught dixon i vonder how
he did it but vell never know that
big fellow is a vonderful liar but look
aint that foony

  he pointed to a monstrously fat woman
who waddled out of the gate in the stockade
under one brawny arm she carried the
wriggling figure of dandra in her other
hand she clutched a roll of parchment which
was tied with a broad red ribbon

  as she came opposite isaacs and dandra
she loosed her hold of dandra and he
dropped to the ground then scuttled away
yelling with fright he was captured by
two warriors and escorted to dixon

  the woman her face glowering with
righteous indignation turned on isaacs
who was giggling loudly

  and so this comes back to me she
panted what with her age her fatness and
her exertions she was almost breathless
she waved the parchment feebly ma-
combe the chief gave it to the man who was
my husband umglubu the pig we called
him and he gave it to me au-a that was
before you came here storekeeper but
just a little while ago my husband left me
in the quiet of the night he went and he took
this from me while i slept many times be-
fore he had tried to take it but always i
slept on my right side and he couldnt but
that night- she sighed but now it is
mine that child of a man came running
into my hut last night squealing with fear
this was in his hand-so i protected him
she stuck it in the slot in her left ear and
waddled pompously away

  the two white men looked at each other
and grinned

  the british ought to give you anything
you ask for for this nights work big un

  - isaacs said heatedly i didnt

do it for them i vas thinking of macombe
and his people he chuckled veil ve did
it didnt ve missioner ve made em run
yes miles said solemnly we made

them run with the sword of the lord-

oy isaacs murmured-he was looking
at the retreating figure of the fat woman
the red ribbon on the parchment dangled
coquettishly down to her shoulders-and

campfire

 i free-to-all
 meeting place
 for reader

   our camp-fire came into being may   with our june issue and since then
its fire has never died down many have gathered about it and they are of all classes
and degrees high and low rich and poor adventurers and stay-at-homes and from all
parts of the earth some whose voices we used to know have taken the long trail
and are heard no more but they are still memories among us and new voices are
heard and welcomed

   we are drawn together by a common liking for the strong clean things of out-of-
doors for word from the earths far places for man in action instead of caged by cir-
cumstance the spirit of adventure lives in all men the rest is chance

   but something besides a common interest holds us together somehow a real com-
radeship has grown up among us men can not thus meet and talk together without
growing into friendlier relations many a time does one of us come to the rest for facts
and guidance many a close personal friendship has our camp-fire built up between
two men who had never met often has it proved an open sesame between strangers
in a far land

   perhaps our camp-fire is even a little more perhaps it is a bit of leaven working
gently among those of different station toward the fuller and more human understand-
ing and sympathy that will some day bring to man the real democracy and brotherhood
he seeks few indeed are the agencies that bring together on a friendly footing so many
and such great extremes as here and we are numbered by the hundred thousand now

   if you are come to our camp-fire for the rirst time and find you like the things we
like join us and find yourself very welcome there is no obligation except ordinary
manliness no forms or ceremonies no dues no officers no anything except men and
women gathered for interest and friendliness your desire to join makes you a member

testimony asked for by e

	foster of our writers brigade
concerning the ant-heap and other
tortures said to be practised by
natives of the philippines will any with
definite first-hand facts on the subject
either tell us about it for camp-fire in gen-
eral or write mr foster in our care

san francisco

  i wish you would ask camp-fire what they know
about the ant-heap and other forms of torture
practised by the little brown brothers in the
philippines i am of the opinion that some of
the old-timers who lived over there in the days of
the empire would say a mouthful personally i have
never seen a man who had escaped from an ant
torture nor have i ever seen the bones of a man
picked clean by the tiny pests but i have heard
the rumor ever since i first set forth in the first
expedition to the philippines-e  foster



        this comrades letter has been
r -t iw sent on fred halsey and it is
to be hoped they have met up

need ask whether he may join our camp-
fire if he wants to come in hes probably
our sort and thats all thats necessary for

  when i was a kid and wanted to come to a camp-
fire that some of the gang had built it was com-
pulsory to bring your puddins with you pud-
dins being a stick of firewood to help keep the fire
going now i ask you may i come into your
camp-fire i have my puddins

fyyas at muscle shoals a few days ago and it
was raining to beat a pat straight i
brought a copy of adventure in order to while away
the time and learned that i was not in existence
at least fred halsey said the macbane is dead
the camp-fire



  i want to thank mr halsey for the many nice
things he said about my kinfolks yes they were a
peace loving family that is the truth for my dad
told me they all loved a peaceful quiet life his
father my grandfather was a stump speaker a
whig when he was not buying cattle it must have
been that some persons did not like grandads ora-
tory for dad at the age of nine years had to swim
the ohio river taking with him two revolvers and a
knife his mother had sent him to meet his dad who
was then on a cattle buying trip dad said the
homecoming was verypeaceful yesthere were quite
a few neighbors to meet them but two guns and a
knife strapped on six-foot john macbane surely
were symbolic of peace and there is no doubt in my
mind but that the neighbors read those peaceful
signs correctly i promise mr hafsey the worlds
peace will not be disturbed by the macbane

  if the halsey and macbane trails ever cross i
sure would like to shake hands with the gentleman
and guarantee to prove to his entire satisfaction
that the macbane is not dead-robert mac-
bane

something about snakes
chasing people i can testify
only that in various copperhead
districts that particular snake
bears the reputation of attacking some-
times without any provocation an east-
ern ohio doctor whose word is gold told
me a man he had treated for the bite had
been bitten from behind while sitting quiet-
ly on a log of course the man may have
lied but what motive would he have

  in the case of this comrade an old lady

i	think we are warranted in printing only
her initials

corpus christi texas

  i see in the copy for november   that
somebody is doubting mr paynes article in regard
to snakes chasing folks now i am not claiming to
be an expert on reptiles but  am going to tell you
what i saw in piney woods of florida

t began my experience as wife and housekeeper
in  and lived at saw mill of which my hus-
band was superintendent i was the only white
woman there one day sitting reading in my room
i noticed a rustling among some papers in the big
fireplace looking up i beheld an enormous snake
with his head raised fully two feet above the floor
gazing me in the face eye to eye as it were snakes
being a horror to me naturally i went away rush-
ing to the porch and springing on a rail i called for
help two colored women rushed to my aid in
time to see my visitor disappearing through a small
hole in the floor the girls poked at him and he
crawled to a brush-heap near-by they attempted
to poke him from there he came and with about
two feet of him in air charged em with haste they
fled to the gallery while snake went under the house

  this was repeated twice finally on third run
one of the women caught mr snake on the end of
her pole and ramming him against the house the
girls dispatched him during all this time i held
my place on the rail of gallery clinging to post and

saw the snake drive the women to the house when
he had the whole state of florida to retreat to

a gain a few years later in far away texas i had
a couple of farm boy friends aged  and 
sunday was a slow day on the farm and every good
fair sunday afternoon the boys went out over the
rail fence into the brush and got up a game with a
big black runner i did not see this snake but i did
see the boys start the game by casting stones into a
thick clump of brush and then fly to the top of
fence sometimes running in line with fence for some
distance and when snake went back repeating
stunt asked why not kill the brute they said that
they played regularly with it lots of fun

  now all this i saw with good eyes and my people
who know me best believe that i tell the truth as i
believe does mr payne cant speak for whole
american continent only texas and florida so that
is that the florida snake was also a black snake

  if you care for this statement publish it with in-
itials only i am a very old woman of the old south
and interested in the old-time stories as given by
you-mrs m a s

something from warren el-
liot carleton in connection with
his swordfishing story in this
issue mr carleton knows from
experience the hazards of trawling off
georges banks

  this matter of getting between a liner and a
trawler in a fog is a hair-raising experience i shall
never forget those two whistles sounding from op-
posite directions-the hazel m jackson running be-
tween them with engine wide open captain bob
jackson at the wheel we couldnt see a thing
through the fog all we knew of the movements of
those steamships was that their whistles sounded
closer and closer until at last the liner went tearing
by astern a gray shadow in the fog broad day-
light too-but in the fog it might just as well have
been night its bad enough for a fisherman to
dodge one deep-sea menace but two at once and
that trawler wasnt much smaller than the liner at
that

  the most vivid recollection i brought back from
the banks is that of the utter abandon with which
some skippers of steamers tear through the fog
let me state definitely-and most skippers of the
swordfishing fleet will back me up in this-that there
are sea captains who show an utter disregard for
fishermen not all of them but enough to make
fishing uncomfortably hazardous they positively
do not sound their fog whistles at half-minute in-
tervals nor do they travel at half speed as the law
specifies

  the fishermen do not ask more all they demand
is regular whistling of fog warnings at half-minute
intervals then they can judge the course of the
liner and sheer out of its path the new england
fishermen play too important a re in the nations
commerce to be treated so shabbily they are
hard-working fearless dependable they play tire
same role on the ocean that the cowboys play in the
west as theodore roosevelt once stated in war
or peace they are never found slacking the ger-
mans did not minimize their commercial importance
io

adventure

for a submarine raided the georges fleet sending to
the bottom captain bob jacksons old schooner
progress and several others

  its surprising how few people know that sword-
fish are caught because they are edible not new
englanders however i think swordfish was the
first fish i ever ate-and from june to september i
still eat it whenever i can get it to my mind it is
the tastiest mess that old father neptune yields
to folks ashore not a bone in it except the back-
bone and the flavor is somewhat like that of chicken
the sword has no commercial value and is usually
thrown overboard as soon as it is amputated from
the expiring fish-warren elliot carleton

you who are already aroused
over the ever increasing measures
for suppression of free speech and
you too who with good or evil
intent are under various pretexts giving
your efforts in aid of such suppression read
the following from the literary digest of au-
gust   already once printed by us
and summoning all pretexts expediences
and evasions answer it if you can

  a document on liberty-a model of kindly
and devasting criticism is what the new york
world calls an editorial in the emporia gazette it
is perhaps the last word of mr william allen white
to his friend governor allen over the recent con-
troversy that brought mr white under orders from
the industrial court of kansas the world would
give it a place among historic public documents
and as such without concerning ourselves further
with the questions that brought it forth we give it
to our readers

to an anxious friend

  you tell me that-law is above freedom of utter-
ance and i reply that you can have no wise laws
nor free enforcement of wise laws unless there is free
expression of the wisdom of the people-and alas
their folly with it but if there is freedom folly
will die of its own poison that is the history of
the race it is the proof of mans kinship with god
you say freedom of utterance is not for time of
stress and i reply with the sad truth that only in
time of stress is freedom of utterance in danger no
one questions it in calm days because it is not
needed and the reverse is true also only when free
utterance is suppressed is it needed and when it
is needed it is most vital to justice peace is good
but if you are interested in peace through force and
without free discussion that is to say free utter-
ance decently and in order-your interest in justice
is slight and peace without justice is tyranny no
matter how you may sugar-coat it with expediency
this state today is in more danger from suppres-
sion than from violence because in the end sup-
pression leads to violence violence indeed is the
child of suppression whoever pleads for justice
helps to keep the peace and whoever tramples upon
the plea for justice temperately made in the name
of peace only outrages peace and kills something
fine in the heart of man which god put there when
we got our manhood when that is killed brute
meets brute on each side of the line

  so dear friend put fear out of your heart this
nation will survive this state will survvie this state
will prosper the orderly business of life will go for-
ward if only men can speak in whatever way given
them to utter what their hearts hold-by voice by
posted card by letter or by press reason never
has failed men only force and repression have
made the wrecks in the world

this woman comrade is i think
assured of a warm welcome at
our camp-fire there are so
many of us in whom the spirit
to go is strong and so many of us who are
shackled by one thing or another

harrisburg pennsylvania

  i am a woman but an adventurer also-only
alas nowadays all my adventuring must be of the
mind and spirit for age and infirmities of the flesh
have put their shackles about my feet and chained
me to one spot but oh how i love adventurers and
how i do enjoy the tales and discussions at camp-
fire for many a camp-fire have i sat by and listened
to tales of hither and yon-and added a few myself

  lately puget sound has been calling and when
i read

no more ill go aroving and pack my blankets
     round-

  ill build myself a cabin on the banks of puget
      sound

my spirit wept for that was just what we were going
to do out there when the storm king took my hus-
bands boat into his grasp and hungry waves car-
ried him out to sea and so here i am back in the
tame lands and i want to come and sit around the
camp-fire and listen in

  i am a stranger in a strange land-none of my
kind here all the women talk of is bridge movies
scandals-and i sit an outsider perhaps the fact
that according to officials at arrow the end of the
moffat railroad over the rockies i am the only
woman who went over the divide on horseback on
the ties of the moffat road  miles may let me in
around the camp-fire to enter that fellowship of
the great outdoors-mrs l h wistrand

from mr h l henderson
came a query as to why hugh
pendexter gave the name hob-
sons choice to a camp in one
of his stories and whether that was the
origin of the familiar expression here is a
copy of mr pendexters reply

                            norway maine
the camp is so designated in waynes orderly
book and was so called because the may fresh
compelled the army to land where it did

according to the spectator no  this say-
ing meaning this or none dates back to
tobias hobson carrier and innkeeper at cambridge
england says the spectator in part he kept a
the camp-fire



stable of forty good cattle always ready and fit for
traveling but when a man came for a horse he was
led into the stable where there was great choice
but was obliged to take the horse which stood near-
est the stable door so that every customer was alike
well served according to his chance and every
horse ridden with the same justice

  in  milton wrote two humorous poems or
epitaphs on the old carriers death

  in the times the editor asks on one occasion
why is the greatest of free communities reduced to
hobsons choice

  possibly hobson was impelled to make this rule as
the greater number of his patrons were university
students and inclined to wild riding in any event
his stable rule has perpetuated his name along with
his rule through nearly three centuries and hob-
sons choice was a bit of familiar vernacular in the
time of waynes campaign-hugh pendexter

scott county iowa is the spot

  in the january th issue there were a few lines
by mr arthur b howard on the famous scout buf-

bill was born he states cody was born near leaven-

him additional data on cody-charles guest

repeatedly at camp-fire
ive said that undoubtedly the
bolshevics are giving their full
support to the anti-weapon craze
now sweeping this country their method
is to gain control of a country by force it
makes it easier to gain control of a country
by force-and to keep control of it-if you
can disarm its people first

  quite possibly that seems only alarmist
stuff but remember that even in the
story the wolf did come and dont forget
that nobody has as yet been able to find out
who is supplying the money and organized
central effort back of this anti-weapon cam-
paign

 read this from the new york herald-
tribunc of march 

  revolution was portrayed with sensational real-
ity yesterday in the course of a communist pageant
given in madison square garden before  mem-
bers and friends of the workers party of america

the occasion was a celebration of the french com-
mune of 

  meanwhile the pageants interpreter a speaker
wearing a red sash and standing on an eminence to
the left of the stage cried out the mistakes ofthe
communists in allowing arms to remain in the hands
of the bourgeoisie

  this error he pointed out resulted in the failure
of the french commune and the russian commun-
ists in  took care not to repeat it he said

  note first that there were in one city at a
single meeting  reds vociferously
present there must be quite a few of
them in the whole country

  and the propaganda at that meeting
seems to have centered pretty definitely on
the idea that the body of the people must be
disarmed and kept disarmed if the red
cause is to succeed permanently

  yet it isnt possible-probable-that it is
the reds who are chiefly back of the anti-
weapon campaign

two of you have sent me a
booklet on the sergeant william
cunningham case you will re-
member that camp-fire has al-
ready heard the charges that cunningham
was railroaded into leavenworth because
he was uncovering extensive graft among
commissioned officers in  the facts
have not yet been clearly established and
that in itself is a disgrace and an injustice
the war department however much it
strives to ignore it is nevertheless responsi-
ble to the people and dependent upon their
good will and the administration how-
ever many and great the scandals it has
triumphantly survived does not command
any too great an allowance of respect for
the loudly advertised whiteness of its moral
garments

  the pamphlet closes with the following

  editor of the new york bulletin-determined
to bring about the liberation of sergt william cun-
ningham members of the kings county council
veterans of foreign wars representing every post
of that order in brooklyn unanimously decided to
thoroughly investigate the charges and fight for a
review of the case which resulted in the confinement
of this veteran to military prisons

  efforts to have an exposure of the grafters plot
made known through the medium of the public press
were fruitless city editors although realizing the
news value of the story dared not run an article
of this kind which would jeopardize their positions
committees of the v f w endeavoring to have
stories concerning this case printed were told that
a hands-off policy was being pursued by the pa-
pers requested to feature the articles


adventure

  the bulletin however had evidenced its fearless-
ness by sponsoring the cause of this worthy ameri-
can

  the post of which the writer has the honor of
being commander contributes a stipulated sum
weekly in order that the committee may proceed
with its duties unhampered by financial need fifty
other posts throughout brooklyn also contribute
to this fund

  it is the belief of the raymond a mclver post
that the kings county council vfw is entitled
to the full credit of sponsoring the fight for the vin-
dication and liberation of cunningham-george
reaney commander raymond a mclver post

  at this writing the latest development is
that an attempt was made to have cun-
ningham adjudged insane but he was in-
stead adjudged sane by a jury district
of columbia supreme court

  some one may really have considered him
insane on the other hand an attempt to
have him adjudged insane is just the move
that would be expected from people who
could thus protect themselves from charges
they did not care to face from a sane man
even if that man had been successfully kept
in prison hah a dozen years after daring to
bring those charges in the first place

 cunningham may be guilty and they
innocent but he is not insane and which-
ever of them is guilty the war depart-
ment and the administration are guilty for
not having the main issue cleared up after
six years by a public trial a thorough ex-
amination into all the facts and an honest
hearing since a civil court was appealed
to in the effort to prove insanity why not
appeal to a civil court in an effort to deter-
mine guilt or innocence a court-martial
does not bear the reputation of being a very
reliable means of determining guilt as a
lawyer or a judge the military man is likely
to be a good soldier the welfare of the
service is often a worthy cause but some-
times it is sadly at variance with justice
which is supposed to be blind to all but the
facts on which it passes discipline is
necessary to military effectiveness but un-
fortunately it sometimes produces aufo-
crats who are accustomed to settling mat-
ters by their own yes or no without too
thorough an examination loyalty to ones
caste and salt has its admirable aspects but
sometimes its personal appeal is irreconcil-
able with loyalty to abstract justice at a
court-martial a counsel is assigned to the
prisoner for his defense but he is likely to
be a junior officer with the unpleasant task

of opposing his own superiors for the sake
of one of his own inferiors nor are court-
martials being human as well as military
free from the charge of having been gov-
erned by undue influences

  decidedly it is up to the war depart-
ment and the administration in general to
vindicate the particular court-martial that
declared cunningham guilty for the
good of the service if for no other reason
there are extant too many affidavits cast-
ing some doubt as to the correctness of its
findings to allow the people to accept those
findings unquestioningly while if all the
charges made against cunninghams accus-
ers condemners and others are true there
is a surpassing rottenness in our military
establishment if these charges are false
they are so injurious that one would think
their victims would insist on public vindi-
cation

  pointing to cunninghams innocence is
the war departments steadfast refusal
under several years bombardment to give
his case any more than a star-chamber re-
hearing particularly when followed by a
futile attempt to prove him insane and if
it is true that the war department or some
other part of the administration has been
exercising pressure on the press not to give
the case publicity it is a natural inference
for many americans that the powers that
be are making a desperate effort to hide
something they are afraid to have seen

  of course cunningham may be a villain
and all the apparent dodging and covering
up merely a sane just and warranted course
bui its high time this were proved to be
the case-a s h

our camp-fire stations are spreading
steadily over the map help make
them grow any qualified person can start
a station

a station may be in any shop home or
other reputable place the only require-
ments are that a station shall display the
regular station sign provide a box or drawer
for mail to be called for and preserve the
register book

   no responsibility for mail is assumed by anybody the
station merely uses ordinary care entries in register to be
confined to name or serial number route destination
permanent address and such other brief notes or remarks as
desired each station can impose its own limit on space to
be used registers become permanent property of station
signs remain property of this magazine so that if there is
due cause of complaint from members a station can be
discontinued by withdrawing sign

   a station bulletin-board is strongly to be recommended
as almost necessary on it travelers can leave tips as to
conditions of trails etc resident members can post their
the camp-fire



  names and addresses such hospitality as they care to offer
  calls for any travelers who are familiar with countries these
  residents once knew calls for particular men if they happen
  that way etc notices or tips about local facilities and con-
  ditions letters to resident members can be posted on this
  bulletin board

  any one who wishes is a member of camp-fire and
  therefore entitled to the above station privileges subject to
  the keepers discretion those offering hospitality of any
  kind do so on their own responsibility and at their own risk
  and can therefore make any discriminations they see fit
  traveling members will naturally be expected to remember
  that they are merely guests and act accordingly

  keepers answer letters only if they wish for local
  information write ask adventure

  a station may offer only the required register and mail
  facilities or enlarge its scope to any degree it pleases its
  possibilities as headquarters for a local club of resident
  camp-fire members are excellent

  the only connection between a station and this magazine
  is that stated above and a keeper is in no other way re-
  sponsible to this magazine nor representative of it

   gold mining in new york state

there seems to be a chance that
it might pay if conducted on a large
enough scale

  request-in a more or less sparsely settled sec-
tion in this state new york not over fifty miles
from this city a german fellow bought a large farm
for little more than a song about three years ago
he was rumored to be an experienced miner of the
olden days in the west he immediately started
to wash gravel and the rumor traveled around the
countryside that he was mining gold however as
no gold had ever been mined in the state of new
york every one began ridiculing him this made
him angry and he built a fence around his place and
would allow no one on the place

  now i have a cousin who lives about five miles
from this germans farm and this german seemed
to take a liking to the fellow he told him in sub-
stanee that he was making money mining gold and
told him to look around his own farm and see what
he could find about that time i happened to go up
to my cousins place and he obtained permission for
me to go and see the germans operations he
seemed a likable fellow and would volunteer quite a
bit of information but if questioned would not give
an answer i know nothing about mining so will
describe his equipment to you he had a trough
about twenty feet long and all over the bottom he
had copper plates about two feet wide-the width of
the trough-and three feet long and they were laid
so they overlapped at the upper end of the trough
he had a box of dirt with a stream of water about an
inch in diameter running in and down over the
plates he would coat the plates with mercury
and stir the dirt up and in about ten minutes they
would be golden yellow then he would scrape
them off with a rubber scraper and put more mer-
cury on and etc

  he told us that my cousins place had the same
kind of dirt and advised us to not let people discour-
age us by telling us there was no gold in new york
state but to look the place over i looked at some
of the dirt that the german was washing and it was
just loam soil but if held in bright sunlight very
tiny golden-colored specks could be seen he was
not taking the dirt out of the ground but just off
the top and had not gone more than four or five
feet below the surface

  we went back to my cousins place and started to
dig on the gravelly side hill this dirt also seemed
to have tiny sparkling specks in and looked the
same as the germans when we got down about
four feet there seemed to be a line of coarser gravel
about six inches wide and this ran through the soil
always about the same distance below the surface
we could find pockets in this gravel where the yel-
low specks could be seen very plainly i took a
sample of this gravel or loam from near the surface
a sample from one of the pockets and then we found
a number of large boulders around the field and i
chipped a piece from different ones that seemed to
have yellow particles in them and sent the three
samples in to the government assay office at salt
lake city and received the following value of gold
to the ton of dirt

    dirt from near the surface si per ton
    dirt from pocket in gravel  per ton
    samples of rock	 per ton

  are these values rich enough to be worked at a
profit if so what would it cost to equip an outfit
to extract the gold from the dirt and also from the
rock if it would cost a large sum to equip but
same could be made to pay when properly equipped
what would be the best way to interest the right
kind of capital in same

  i was unable to find the ledge from which the
boulders came from which i chipped the samples
as these samples i have mentioned were on top or
near the top of the ground would it be likely to be
richer down deeper i washed some dirt myself
by cleaning a copper plate with acid and coating
with mercury my plates colored all right but after
i scraped the mercury and gold off had no way of
separating them how is this done after this
mercury and gold i had scraped off the plates had
been carried around in a bottle for a few days it
seemed to turn a more greenish color what was
the cause of that

  as we do not know a single thing about mining any
information you might be able to give us would be
very much appreciated i can get hold of about
a hundred acres of land adjoining my cousins
place quite cheap and would like to find out if it
would be advisable to purchase or not-carmon
miller schenectady n y

  reply by mr victor shaw-it is not unlikely
that there is gold in new york state although you
dont say just where this is except that it is around
fifty miles from schenectady the great lauren-
tian plateau the rock of which is pre-cambrian
in point of geological time and which practically
covers canada has a long tongue which extends
down into new york state it is in these pre-
cambrian rocks that most of the rich mines in que-
bec ontario and other provinces have been dis-
covered including cobalt and porcupine and the
new strikes made recently in the abitibi district
the place you mention may perhaps be included
in this area so if the metal found should be gold
this gives a reason why

  next you either should be very certain before
you put any cash into this thing either for pur-
chases or for development that these tiny golden-
colored specks are in reality the gold they seem to
be there is in canada an amber mica called
phlogopite which in very minute particles re-
sembles gold is it not a possibility that what
you see in that top soil might be phlogopite and
not gold this might be retained by mercury
plates in sufficient amounts to color it yellow and
so fool the old mining man

  i should say however judging from your sample
tests that there was gold in the dirt that would re-
pay development not by hand methods but by
hydraulicking or working a dredge over large areas
gold averaging forty to fifty cents a cubic yard may
be handled thus at a profit

  another point your yellow specks might be a
pyrite containing gold and so youd get a result in
gold from a test pyrites often serve as a carrier for
the gold in fact judging from your assay return
i should say this seems the most probable espe-
cially since the assay of the rock sample shows
higher in value perhaps the rock distintegrates and
permeates the soil with these gold-bearing pyrites

  to work ground showing only what your assays
show in value you would need to reduce great
quantities as by dredging or hydraulical methods
ask adventure



your profit or otherwise depends solely upon the
relative costs of operation it may be your turns
might show a profit in some localities and not in
others depending upon production-cost you can
not expect any one to commit himself as to this
unless he could see the ground and size up installa-
tion and operating costs i should not like to say
that a small sluice using amalgamation plates such
as you say your german acquaintance is using
would show a reasonable profit though he may not
care how much his labor item stands him in get
me

  small sluicing operations on seward peninsula
alaska average c per cubic yard of dirt dredges
are working on ground averaging c per cubic yard

  your boulders may be ice-carried erratics
brought from great distances

  gold is retained by an amalgamation plate be-
cause mercury has a chemical affinity for gold
until it resembles soft putty when scraped off
in this shape a quantity is placed in a cast-iron re-
tort and subjected to a cherry-red heat the mer-
cury vaporizes and is taken off and condensed
through a tube and is used again with some slight
loss it is all vaporized leaving a button of gold
called a retort this may be sold to any dealer
u s assay office bank or jeweler by troy
weight at a price depending upon its fineness it is
then refined and the pure gold separated from what-
ever silver copper and other dirt it may contain
these retorts are sold in small sizes and you could
get one and experiment figuring up your relative
costs if your plates turned greenish after standing
i should think it probable that you have gold-bear-
ing pyrites either iron or copper

   homesteading in new brunswick

ideal land for the man wanting to
live in the open

  request-i am farm raised mich married
twenty years of age we are interested in home-
steading in a timbered country with a cool climate
we want to get away from autos electric lights and
walnut furniture and want fresh air and a bit of the
world to ourselves instead

  we hope to make our start in the spring of 
we shall have between  and 

do you consider this sufficient capital providing
we go slow we are both used to work and expect
plenty of it

  is this country rolling or level heavily timbered
or otherwise principal woods

  is the climate much different from central michi-
gan principal crops and fruits would sheep be
well adapted to climate is country watered by
streams lakes or both game and fish could one
pick up a few dollars to help out trapping are
game laws strict or are they about the same as
ours mich what are new brunswicks laws
concerning homesteads and homesteaders regula-

tions and duties on goods brought in from the u s
or to whom should i write for this information

  where can i obtain a map of this region

  what would be the best route to new brunswick
from detroit

  i would appreciate any suggestions or further
information you might give

  i realize i am asking a great deal of time and
trouble however i am seriously interested and not
inquiring from idle curiousity

  if by any chance this should be published please
omit name please acccpt my sincere thanks for
your time and attention-----

  reply by major belford-i sympathize with
your desire to get out in the open

  i note the amount of capital you will have and
i am keeping it in mind in this letter you can
certainly make a fair start on 

  the new brunswick country is a rolling country
the wild lands are timbered with beech maple oak
elm pine and spruce the climate will be much
the same as central michigan the crops also would
be the same as in that state new brunswick is an
especially good potato country sheep would do well

  the country is exceedingly well watered having
many noble rivers fed by good streams it is one
of the game and fish paradises of the world trap-
ping would be a useful help and you could pick up
a good many dollars by that means

  write to the department of mines fredericton
new brunswick for copies of the game laws maps
regulations as to free grants and general information
about the province

  from detroit to new brunswick you would take
the canadian northern railway or the canadian
pacific railway

  i hope you will find this of some little help and
if there is any further information please write me
again

      the worlds largest island

      where vast areas still remain unes-
vjv plored

  request-please send me general information
about new guinea hunting people customs his-
tory etc thank you in advance-erwin b
carter clintonville wis

  reply by mr armit-you ask for general in-
formation of new guinea which is rather a tall
order dont you think so but i will try and cram
into the short space of this epistle all i can about
your various questions a short history of the great
island would be hard to get into the space of one is-
sue of our magazine and the same remark ap-
plies to yonr other queries however here is
something that may interest you

  hunting new guinea is not much of a place for
hunting as it is not well endowed with game like its
sisters on the western sde of wallaces line-the
imaginary line laid down by the celebrated alfred
russel wallace the equal of that master of science
charles darwin wallace found that the fauna of
asia extended only as far east as borneo and some
other islands in the malay archipelago east of
adventure

those islands the faunaof australaisa has its stamp-
ing ground and the largest game in this region is the
kangaroo and other marsupials new guinea has
the wallaby a cousin of the kangaroo many minor
species of the same family and the hog there is
nothing larger in the immense jungles that clothe
the huge island other than the cassowary which is a
bird not unlike the emu of australia new guinea
has no dangerous animals no monkeys but she is
well supplied with crocodiles-huge man-eaters that
take toll of flesh from the savages that have their
homes in the deltas of the numerous rivers crocodile
shooting is fair sport but the swamps are not ex-
actly the sort of spots one goes to seek amusement
in mosquitoes plus malaria make them worth
keeping away from jungle hog provides good sport
when the hunter takes a couple of good dogs with
him to beat up the quarry and the hog gives one a
run for his money before he takes the count a pig
all his life yet he dies like a gentleman-fighting

  people the island is populated by melanesians
if you care to learn more about this branch of the
human race read the melanesians of british new
guinea by dr c g seligman a text book pub-
lished in london england and obtainable in most
public libraries the customs of these folk are de-
tailed at length in this work you will certainly
learn some curious customs if you dip into this book

  history new guinea was first reported by two
portuguese mariners antonio abreu and francisco
serram in  don jorge de meneses the portu-
guese governor of the island of ternate is said to
have landed on the shores of the mystery island in
 alvaro de saavedra a spaniard who was a
kinsman of cortes the burglar of mexico coasted
the island in  and  trying to get back home
to spain he was of an inquisitive nature and is
credited with the discovery of gold on the northern
toast which made him label the island isla del
oro or island of gold

  various world wanderers floated around the
island in the centuries that followed the visits of the
portuguese and spaniards the chart shows their
names attached to islands capes rivers and bays
but little interest was taken in the island until the
great powers had almost finished the partition of
the older sections of the world then the eyes of
three nations turned to new guinea-england
germany and holland they came to an agree-
ment and split the huge island almost equally be-
tween them in  and so the white man came to
push his way into the country then came the
great disturbance of -and germany lost her
section to the australian naval and military expe-
ditionary force on the surrender of governor haber
to general holmes in september  thus aus-
tralia now has two separate colonies in new guinea
the territory of papua which she owns and the ter-
ritory of new guinea which comprises the former
german section and which she administers by
mandate from the league of nations the dutch
still hold their section the western of the enormous
island

  miscellaneous new guinea leads the world in
the number of her feathered denizens and she has
the honor of being the haunt of the birds of paradise
-the most gorgeously plumed birds that command
so much attention from females the wide world over
there are roughly some fifty-six species of the para-
disea all magnificently plumed if you visit the
principal museums of new york or chicago you will

feastyour eyes on some splendid specimens of these
wonderful birds

  new guinea is a vast island-the largest in the
world-and is  miles long with a greatest width
of  miles and covers  square miles of
surface it is located to the north of australia and is
shaped not unlike a chinese dragon it is a vol-
canic country and possesses several active volca-
noes and it also owns some very fine glaciers the
latter are located in the vicinity of mount caerstenz
in the snow mountains of the dutch colony

  hope the foregoing will interest you

 address your question direct to the
expert in charge not to the magazine

radio sets

distance and how to get it

  request-can a single stage of radio frequency
amplification be added to wiring diagram attached
if this can be done without doing away with the
principle of tuning will you please add same for me
also please say what kind of a transformer you
would advise using

  if you see anything you think would help out on
the wiring diagram say so always open for sug-
gestions of any kind biggest fault at present is
that it howls too much and when you pick up your
station and reduce a battery current station will
jump off

  this set did not howl when first made stations
came in like a ton of brick but of late has howled
any suggestions will be appreciated envelope and
postage enclosed if this goes to adventure please
use initials-c a r indianapolis ind

  reply by mr mcnicol-the circuit you have
does not lend itself readily to adding radio fre-
quency why not add two stages of audio fre-
quency to what you have this would give you
loud speaker volume and with a -foot antenna
you should be able to reach out  or  miles
with it under average conditions

  if you add a f use amertran no  and amer-
tran no  transformers no  first stage and no 
second stage best tubes would be a in each
of the a f stages

  the howling you get now that did not originally
appear is likely due to the increase in the number of
broadcasting stations multiplicity of carrier
waves are causing just this trouble very widely

where the old west lingers

cowtowns where lead poisoning
is not unknown today

  request-i am a regular reader of adventure
thus my knowledge of your name and address and
of all the stories i enjoy i like those which feature
hashknife hartley and sleepy stevens i dont like
to read about the west of the old days its gone and
the modern west is taking its place

  now can you give me some information i know
they have all the modern vehicles of transportation
and all the other new improvements but

  are there any unfenced ranges where they have
their yearly roundups

  are there any cowtowns like adventure mentions
do the cowboys still wear the specified guns as in
the old days

do they still come to town like the stories tell us

  and last of all can you tell me where there are
some good ranches that i could write to for some
pictures

  this is a long letter for you to answer but these
things have always bothered me because i feel that
in a few years the ranches will be gone and the help
in white collars and ties will be riding in machines
and we will no longer get a thrill reading about the
ranges of the old days-harold ford phila-
delphia pa

  reply by mr harriman-do not be too sure
about the old west being gone i can show you
scads of ranches where they still run things exactly
as they did fifty years ago only the old man is apt
to go to town in a  hp auto rather than on a
cayuse

  in  i helped rope and brand cattle on such
a ranch that same year i talked with a bunch of
waddies who had gathered for the fall roundup in
northern arizona and were cursing their luck be-
cause a foot of snow had fallen why boy what
do you know about the west anyhow

  i know a cowboy who left shell wyoming and
rode for eight days he only saw six men in the
whole trip outside of a few in two tiny hamlets and
four or five in three ranch houses

  i have ridden a horse all day in utah and did not
encounter a fence of any kind there were 
sheep on the plain i crossed and  cattle in the
mountains where i slept that night everything
was precisely as it had been forty or fifty years ago

  yes there are unfenced ranges galore where they
have roundups

  yes there are cowtowns where a man can get
lead poisoning if he acts ugly or mean i went to
one in  six men shot the first day of the rodeo
there is that woolly enough for you

-in arizona a man is supposed to get rid of his
gun within twenty minutes of getting into a town--
state law in new mexico they wear them any
old place they go in wyoming it is half and half

 cowboys will always go to town when they get
a chance but shooting up towns has become un-
popular and so many townmen own pump shotguns
and keep buckshot shells that it is risky anyhow
the percentage of fools among cowmen is never half
as great as some writers try to get you to believe
i never even had one talk ugly to me fine fellows

  what kind of pictures do you want to get those
that show the roping branding etc not one

ranch in a hundred would have any such and not
for sale purposes at any rate the place to get these
is in some town in the cattle country and i dont
know the firm names

  dont you believe the ranches will all be gone
there will be lots of them in 

  lots of land only lit for ranches and folks will
eat beef

comparative merits of double-
barreled and magazine rifles for tiger-

shooting

  request-i am contemplating a trip to india in
the near future please answer the following ques-
tions and send me bill if there is a charge for this
service

  recently i handled a double-barreled rifle and fell
very much in love with this type are they accu-
rate how do they compare with the springfield
what do they weigh i have been informed by a
firearms expert that they do not compare with a
magazine rifle in efficiency is this so i want one
for tiger-i mean a double what caliber would
you suggest

  what pistol would you take what shotgun
what size shot

  any information you could give me on the above
will be greatly appreciated-f w koles biloxi
miss

  reply by capt giddings-i can quite under-
stand your falling in love with the double-barreled
rifle made by one of englands best gunmakers
it is a really magnificent weapon and one in which
the sportsman finds a never-ending delight

  i know positively from personal experimentation
that the best double-barreled rifle is not so accurate
as the springfield or certain match rifles manu-
factured in this country on the other hand the
double-barrel as made by an expert gunmaker will
shoot as accurately as you can hold from the various
positions one assumes in firing during a hunting
trip as regards accuracy you i assert will never
know the difference between a well-made double
and the springfield in hunting at ranges under three
hundred yards provided both guns are of the same
caliber you could not of course compare a double
 with the  springfield for trajectory the
former bullet has many times the drop or trajectory
of the flat-shooting springfield at  yards

  for tiger i would recommend a double-barreled
rifle made by holland  holland purdy rigby
lang or any other of the top-notch english gun-
makers in caliber ranging from  magnum 
grain bullet to the  it has been my experience
that the two shots quick gun is superior to the
magazine rifle in hunting all kinds of dangerous
game aside from the frequent mal-functions of
magazine arms in large calibers i dislike the noisy
clank clank of the bolt or lever in functioning and
the relatively slow speed of the following or second
shot

  tigers and lions charge with amazing rapidity
unless one is entirely without nerves and a wizard
with a magazine rifle two shots are all that can be
effectively gotten in and in delivering these two
shots rapidly and efficiently no other arm can com-
pare with the two-barreled rifle in my opinion

  the double or medium and large caliber will


adventure

weigh from eight and one-half pounds to twelve
pounds sometimes more i shot a double-barrel
chambered for the well-known rigby  which
weighed eight and three-fourths pounds but which
was so beautifully balanced that it actually felt light-
er than my  mm mauser nevertheless it is my
opinion that the double rifle of  to  caliber
can be built much lighter-and still be quite safe-
than the english gunmakers are building them at
present the recoil might be somewhat increased
it is true but in hot countries i should prefer re-
coil to weight

  the right barrel is the master barrel and even
from a machine rest the left barrel shoots some-
what off no matter how expert the maker the
amount varying with the range intensity of car-
tridge design of bullet etc at ordinary shooting
ranges for which the particular cartridge is designed
this off-shooting by the left barrel will be of no con-
sequence in the field

  i am partial to the  mm luger as a sidearm when
hunting dangerous game on account of its greater
penetration not that i consider any type of pistol
will take the place of the rifle but one occasionally
has use for the sidearm in a pinch several ameri-
cans who hunt much in africa have discarded the 
auto colt for the luger having found that the
 lacks penetration

  for a shotgun i would recommend a high grade
l c smith or fox two shotguns with which i am
familiar they should have either - or -inch
barrels-the latter pair points better with two and
three-fourths-inch chambers both full choke and
 gage i like the western super x two and three-
fourths-inch shell shooting an ounce of shot for large
fowl in shot fives should do for peafowl and sixes
for jungle cock take along a supply of shells
loaded with the solid -gage ball in case of the
unexpected tiger a friend in india reports having
made a splendid load by first waxing a lethal ball
and inserting it in the ordinary super x case after
having taken out the shot these lethal balls are
made with flanges of soft metal on the surface of the
ball which allows them to be shot out of a full-choked
gun any english dealer can supply you with these
balls just ask for lethal -gage balls

  i have gotten to the point where i offer you the
above with the utmost diffidence though it comes as
the result of personal experience and observation
i have had my arguments my experience and
that of my friends and comrades set at naught
by certain ballistic and firearm experts who showed
me on paper just how foolish my arguments and
claims for the double-barrel the luger and certain
cartridges were the fact that these guns have been
in the hands of thousands of sportsmen for many
years and performed satisfactorily seems to be of no
significance iast winter in chicago i heard the
double-barreled rifle denounced as being a relic of a
bygone age-something left behind far behind in
the march of progress not being a ballistic engi-
neer nor an expert on firearms i did not go beyond
venturing the remark that this type of weapon had
served me pretty well during a somewhat hectic
decade

  i think we of ask adventure service try to give
you largely the results of our actual experiences in
the countries we handle whether it applies to guns
or employment or whatever the desideratum we
have no ax to grind-no particular brand of fire-
arms shells or equipment to foist upon you

  there is no charge for this service it is a plea-
sure to answer questions set out so clearly as yours

 when you get something for nothing
dont make the other fellow pay the post-
age on it

the belgian congo

anything but a health resort

  request-i have an opportunity offered me by
a firm to go down to the belgian congo west
africa alternating between the towns of matadi
and kinshassa on the congo river with most of
my time spent at matadi for a period of two years
or more if desired

  any information you could give me especially
as regards outfitting climate as it affects whites
and living conditions would be greatly appreci-
ated---

  reply by mr simpson-the belgian congo is a
bit out of my territory which extends only as far as
calabar but i can at least tell you this much that
a two-year stretch on the west coast of africa is too
long i would not advise any man to try to do more
than a year at a time with at least four months rest
at home between trips

  i should imagine the firm that sends you out
would give you all the information you desire about
an outfit that would be in keeping with the kind
of job you are going to hold down

  the weather in west africa is of two kinds it
rains a lot between march and october or thereby
and it doesnt rain at all the rest of the time but
its always hot the climate as may be gathered
from the first paragraph of this letter is very bad
and theres no use wrapping up that fact in any
kind of silver paper to make it look better than it is
white men can stand it-a little at a time-and
even that is sometimes too much this is not in-
tended to discourage but to caution no man can
fool with west africa-any part of it-and not pay
for the privilege

  living conditions vary in different localities but
i assume you will live in at the firms headquarters
and this as a general thing is comfortable enough
discomfort begins when you have to do a lot of
trudging and camping out in the bush just by
way of a few general hints

  select your sun-helmet very carefully as big and
as light a helmet as you can get

  see that your rain coat is a really good one rain
boots too

  dont stint on the uniform cases you buy get
them strong air-tight and white-ant-proof

  dont take anything of leather except shoes and a 
belt leather is not much good for anything in the
tropics

  dont take anything you really value with you
the natives will steal it sooner or later

  be careful to avoid night chills

  in spite of all other advice to the contrary leave
liquor severely alone concentrate on quinine

  dont rush dont get excited a quiet mind and
an even steady pace in all things is perhaps the best
advice i can give any man who hopes to beat the
game on the west coast of africa

  good luck to you

a nother song that id like to know a great
deal more about is the famous casey jones
this song in the form in which it is commonly sung
today is the product of eddie newton and t law-
rence siebert and was copyrighted by them in 
they did not however originate the song but
merely made a new version built upon older ma-
terial much of this material was in the form of
scattered stanzas some of which dealt with jay
gould and not with casey jones at all

  there is even some debate as to whether or not
there ever was an actual casey jones though it is
almost certain that before the time of newton and
siebert these scattered verses had formed them-
selves into something like a regular song dealing
with an actual wreck where and when this wreck
occurred and who the engineer was are questions
not yet satisfactorily answered

  then immediately following the version of new-
ton and siebert dozens of other stanzas and ver-
sions sprang up built in turn upon their work
these were largely the work of various railroad men

  the whole history is very complicated and im
turning to you for help send in as many versions
or stray verses as you can and state as accurately
as possible when you heard them and where tell
me all you can about the wreck or about casey him-
self but be sure to distinguish between facts that
you know to be facts and mere hearsay both are
of value but they should not be mixed

  again ill make the same offer i made in the case
of frankie and johnny a six months subscrip-
tion to the reader sending in within one month the
most helpful reply to this call for information

the two best articles i know on the history ap-
peared in the railroad mans magazine in -
 from which i reprint through the courtesy of the

my third version which differs slightly from one
given in the articles above referred to comes from
mr c h street of kenosha wisconsin

original casey jones

-come all you rounders i want you to hear
the story told of an engineer

old casey jones was the rounders name

a high right-wheeler of mighty fame

caller called jones about half past four

he kissed his wife at the station door

climbed into the cab with his orders in his hand
and says this is my trip to the holy land

through the south memphis yards on the fly

he heard his fire-boy say youve got a white eye
and all the switchmen knew by the engines moans
that the man at the throttle was old casey jones

it had been raining some five or six weeks

the railroad track looked like the bed of a creek
they loaded him down to a thirty-mile gait

and threw the southbound mail about eight hours
    late

fireman hollered casey youre going too fast

you run a block board the last station we passed
yes says casey but i think well make it
through

for she is steaming better than i ever knew

jones said fireman dont you fret

keep knocking at that firebox dont give it up yet
for i am going to run her till she leaves the rail

or make it on time with the southern mail

around the curve and over the dump
two locomotives were bound to bump

firemen hollered jonesie shes right ahead

we might jump and make it but well all be dead

around the curve he spied a train

reversing his engine caused the bell to ring
fireman jumped off but casey stayed on-

was a good engineer but hes dead and gone

old casey jones he was all right

he stuck to his duty both day and night

they loved to hear his whistle and the ring of no 
as he came into memphis on the old i c

headaches and backaches and all kinds of pain
are not apart from a railroad train

tales that are earnest noble and grand
are all in the life of a railroad man

                 casey jones
by a section man
come all you dagos if you want to hear
a story of a real good engineer

casey shannon was the heros name
on a dinky line boys he won his fame

casey was known throughout the run
to shine his engine when his work was done

and every one knew by the engines whine
when casey ran on the dinky line

through the marchfield yards he let her speed
eating up coal with hoggish greed

he looked at his watch trembled and said

we shall make it but well all be dead

casey pulled up into something burg

and no  was hitting the curve

casey said boys youd better jump

cause theres two big engines thats going to bump

casey said before he died

there were two more engines that hed like to ride
miller asked which may they be

the nine-ninety-seven and the six-thirty-three

                  casey jones

                   by d negro
casey looked out and saw that cow

he tried to stop but couldnt somehow

he said to the boy we are going to bump

and while theres time you had better jump

all right boss the boy replied

and left the cab by the door in the side

when the wreck was cleared poor casey was dead
but the boy got up half crazy and said

now all you ramblers in mourning go

for the prince of ramblers is lying low

and all you maidens that love the name
put on your mourning veils again

thats enough to show how varied the song is
today and how complicated its history every
scrap of information that any one of you can send
in will be appreciated

and before its too late to obtain them the
blues ought to be collected and preserved
owing to the modem fad for blues and the con-
sequent production of imitations the old and gen-
uine specimens are being forgotten or becoming

hopelessly confused with the new and the spurious
the blues form a distinct type of song curious and
interesting not only for the words but for the strange
wailing music the following example is i think
genuine i wish i could add the music which gives
it most of its effectiveness it came to me through
a friend who had captured it from negro singing
