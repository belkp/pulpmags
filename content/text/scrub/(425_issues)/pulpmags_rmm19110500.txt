all infants unfortunately this birth boon is often undervalued and
neglected with the result that the beauty gradually disappears

   the use ot common impure soaps is answerable for much of this
skin deterioration and for this there is no excuse since the best and
purest of all skin soaps

 pears soap

is really more economical than ordinary soaps because of the fact that it lasts twice
as long the pre-eminence of pears soap all the world over is easily accounted
for it is composed entirely of natural beauty preserving ingredients its emollient
action ensures the skin of a permanent softness and delicacy of color and exercises
a protective influence that keeps it in perfect condition

     pears is all solid soap purity and goodness having no water mixed with it and
being unaffected by heat or cold since s pears has been the mothers soap of
the world

       the general idea of mothers day is a simultaneous observance in every country of the love and reverence
       men women and children owe to a good mother the second sunday in may is observed as mothers day

       to unite in making the observance universal do some distinct act ot kindness to the sick or unfortunate

   what makes the victor tone so sweet clear and natural and of such
splendid volume people ask as they become captivated by the unequaled
victor tone-quality

   the goose-neck construction of the tone-arm is largely responsible a
little thing in itself but a great big thing in what it accomplishes

    it puts the weight of the sound-box in the proper place and at the proper
angle to get the best results from every record

    its flexibility enables the reproducing point to follow the lines of the sound-
waves so closely that every detail is reproduced with absolute fidelity

   and besides improving the tone the goose-neck adds to the convenience
of using the victor

   this exclusive patented goose-neck is only one of the many valuable
features that help to make the victor the worlds greatest musical instrument

   if you have never heard a victor of the present day go to the nearest
victor dealers and hear it youll be astonished at the height of perfection
it has reached in recent years

and be sure to hear the victor-victrola

victor talking machine co camden n j usa

 the railroad builders

by walter gardner seaver

when railroads throughout the west were warring with one another
for new territory and pushing their tracks through that part of kansas
and nebraska known ag the great american desert the intense rivalry
between the builders of competing roads often gave rise to incidents many
of which are still unwritten history

   the first instalment of mr seavers series of stories told by promoters
engineers and contractors deals with the rough-and-ready tactics of these
western railroad builders whom no obstacles however great could overcome
and who sought to finish their work on time even if they had to help them-
selves to the building material belonging to another line

part i-the fight for rails

master-strokes of nerve daring and audacity that marked the efforts of
the men who struggled to win supremacy for
the roads they were building

and wichita a part of the missouri pacific
system the frisco system had a line run-
ning from monett missouri to wichita
but offered no competition to the santa fe
as it was controlled by that line

  the southern kansas from kansas city
to independence and thence west to medi-
cine lodge was the only line through the
osage diminished reserve from east to
west and the two southern tiers of counties
depended upon it entirely for their supply

sible to get soft coal from the mines in south-

public opinion behind a railroad

 the freight and passenger

south of the arkansas river was

peka and santa fe lines with the exception
of what went to the st louis fort scott

eastern kansas during the winter of -
 either for the reason that the southern
kansas did not have cars enough to serve the
territory or because of a combination be-
tween the dealers and the railway to restrict
the supply and thus advance prices what-
ever the cause coal at any of the stations
west of elk city cost from twenty-five to
forty cents a bushel delivered

  during the fall of  an immense corn
crop had been gathered all through southern
kansas but the price was low the grain
bringing but ten cents a bushel delivered at
the railroad as a result corn was used
for fuel and made a quick and exceedingly
hot fire though the majority of people found
that in the spring their stoves were burned
out and fit only for scrap

  colonel joseph hansen superintendent
of the union depot at st joseph missouri
and prior to that superintendent of the st
joseph and denver city was thoroughly
familiar with the situation and the country
he planned a line of narrow-gage road that
was to connect the cairo arkansas and
texas then being built down through ar-
kansas and texas by the palmer-sullivan
syndicate with the denver and rio grande
also a narrow-gage system running out of
denver

wanted broad-gage

  associated with him was j j bums of
belle plain kansas charles c black of
winfield kansas colonel john doniphan
henry m hansen frederick c parker of
st joseph and a number of others who had
filed a charter incorporating the denver
memphis and atlantic railway

  the line was to run from memphis ten-
nessee crossing the cairo arkansas and
texas now the cotton belt at or near
brinkley and thence along the white river
valley in arkansas to joplin missouri it
was to pass through baxter springs kan-
sas crossing the missouri kansas and tex-
as at chetopa kansas and thence through
coffeyville sedan winfield belle plain
kingman and larned

  the proposed line would tap the rich
coal-fields of southeastern kansas as well as
those of arkansas in arkansas for a hun-
dred miles it ran through forests of yellow
pine the announcement of the project was
hailed with delight by the people all along
the proposed line and when issues of bonds
in aid of the line were proposed the elections

were carried in every county with very little
opposition

  just about the time that the contract for
the underwriting of the bonds was to be
closed the palmer-sullivan lines went into
the hands of a receiver as did also the den-
ver and rio grande it was found that no
funds could be secured for a narrow-gase

                                    o o

system as the palmer-sullivan smash
caused bankers to believe that narrow-gage
lines were not practical when brought into
competition with those using standard gage

special act passed

  something had to be done so the denver
memphis and atlantic secured the passage
of an act in the kansas legislature permit-
ting companies incorporated to build nar-
row-gage lines to build standard-gage roads
instead this was in the winter of -
s

  the -time stipulated for the building of
the line in the county aid propositions had
elapsed or so nearly so that a compliance
was impossible and it became necessary to
make a second appeal for help colonel
hansen having received assurances that
with the aid voted for a standard-gage line
the underwriting would be forthcoming

  just about this time the santa fe which
had ignored the denver memphis and at-
lantic scheme began to sit up and take no-
tice under the impression that there was
something doing joab mulvane of to-
peka had charge of the santa fe exten-
sions he incorporated the independence
and southwestern and entered the field
against the denver memphis and atlantic
mulvane intended to build only enough of
the independence and southwestern to head
off and kill the denver road and then
leave the independence line to be operated
as a spur only as he thought that the peo-
ple wanted a railroad and did not care who
built it so long as they had the line

not in touch with public

  he either forgot or did not know that the
denver memphis and atlantic was really
the result of a short-sighted policy on the
part of the southern kansas management
and that the cordial warmth of the people
toward the denver road was due not so
much to the fact that it was a new project
as to the fact that it promised them cheap
lumber and coal and opened to them the
the railroad builders



markets of the southeast from their
knowledge of the personnel of die denver
directorate they were satisfied that the line
would be one that would benefit the people

  joab mulvane was a keen shrewd saga-
cious man so loyal in every fiber of his be-
ing to the santa fe that the success of his
road had actually became a religion with
him he could rot tolerate the idea of an-
other line coming into its territory andcould
not see why a network of santa fe lines
would not serve the people better than a
score or so of small ones

  he was not in direct touch with the mass
of the people however and he did not know
that the efforts of the men at the front and
in die operating department to secure die
friendship of the farmers along the line was
handicapped and in many cases entirely
nullified by the traffic department

caused some excitement

  the first time that mulvane came up
against the denver in a square tussle was at
sedan in chautauqua county when the
question was put to the people as to which
road should secure the county bonds amount-
ing to  the campaign had been
a hot one and everybody in the county was
worked up over it no political campaign
had ever evoked the interest that this one
had

  with few exceptions the entire press of
the country along the proposed line were
heart and soul with the denver proposition
the story of the battle at sedan is thus told
by one who was there not merely as a  look-
er on in vienna but as an active worker
for the denver memphis and atlantic

   i guess that the first time that joab
really got a full understanding of the feel-
ing of the people was when he ran against
charlie black secretary of the denver
memphis and atlantic at sedan the seat
of chautauqua county the denver mem-
phis and atlantic-vvas asking for 
bonds of the county in aid of the road

   the independence and southwestern
was asking for the same joab mulvane
was president of the independence line
which was building from independence
down toward cedar vale and arkansas city
it was a santa fe extension and the people
had an idea that it was only a scheme to
head off the denver road and that if the
latter had not entered the field no one would
have ever heard of the independence and

southwestern for it would practically par-
allel the southern kansas

a fight to the finish

    both roads had the requisite number of
signers to their petitions to call the election
and the county commissioners were in a
quandary as to what they should do in the
matter mulvane and black both appeared
before the commissioners and made argu-
ments in favor of their propositions

    mulvane laid strong stress on the fact
that the denver was a paper road and had
no assurances to give the people that it
would ever be built and told the commis-
sioners that they should demand of black
the names of the underwriters of his propo-
sition as an evidence of good faith and a
guarantee that the road would be built

  now the santa fe had been moving
heaven and eardi to find out who was be-
hind the denver memphis and atlantic
but it had been foiled at every turn so far
as the public at large knew there was not a
dollar behind it mulvane said that on the
other hand everybody knew the santa fe
and that was evidence enough that the road
would be built if the bonds were voted to
the independence and southwestern he
closed by challenging black to show the
people that he could build the road before
he asked them to tie up the bonds

cheap coal and lumber

    black responded in a speech in which
he set fordi the advantages that his line
offered in the matter of cheap coal and
lumber from arkansas as well as giving
the people a competing market at memphis
against chicago and st louis he said
that the names of his underwriters con-
cerned only the members of his board and
that it was not necessary that he should give
this information as in so doing he would
give the santa fe information that it had
been vainly scouring new york to obtain

    the proposition was plain on its face
no bonds could be issued if voted until
the road was completed with cars running
thereon to the points in die county named
in the petition and therefore it was no con-
cern of the commissioners whether the road
had a dollar behind it or not

    they were there to determine which road
would be of the most benefit to the county
and the people and if this result was in


the railroad mans magazine

favor of the denver road the county com-
missioners assumed no liability for if the
road was not built no bonds would be issued

  an overflow meeting was held in the
court-house at which young joab mul vane
and the editor of a little country paper in
crowley county who was an assistant to
black did the speaking

   young mulvane wore a black alpaca
coat a white vest white shirt and tie dark
pants patent-leather shoes and a straw hat
of the latest style

didnt know rube editor

  the country newspaper man on the
contrary had been in the saddle all the week
campaigning from house to house among
the farmers and was clad like the majority
of men in the audience he wore a broad-
brimmed straw hat through a hole in the
crown of which a wisp of hair stuck out a
checked hickory shirt and jeans pants stuck
into his boots

  he had not been shaved for a week
and though he stood close to young mulvane
the latter did not know him

   during the latters speech he said that
the denver crowd claimed to be building
the road to benefit the people but they were
only out for the dollars and their design
was to get aid voted along several hundred
miles of their proposed line and then ex-
pected the santa fe to buy them out if
they were wise they would demand of the
county commissioners that they call the
election for the independence and south-
western and thus be sure of a railroad and
not find themselves sold out when it was too
late

   he was followed by the newspaper man
who by reason of his campaigning had be-
come known to every man in the county
who made only a few remarks closing by
saying

   men you all know me i am one of
you i live in this section of the state
my interests are your interests your suc-
cess is my success i suppose i ought to
have rustled up a silk hat and a biled shirt
to talk to you in and tell you how to vote
but you know me and know that i cant
afford it my friend says that we are out
for the dollars certainly thats what i
am running my paper for

      it is what you fellows are raising corn
wheat oats hogs and cattle for now men
i would like to make enough out of this

scheme so that i can afford to wear a little
dinky straw hat and a biled shirt when i
come down here to tell you how to vote
the right ticket now people will you help
me to get it 

   all the men there were clad in their
rough working clothes just as they had
come in from their farms and this young
editors talk struck them just right for they
had the western contempt for a man that
was dressy

   the county commissioners decided to
take a vote of the crowd as to which rail-
road should have the election called and
they all adjourned to the outside and joined
those in the square the chairman of the
board of commissioners put the motion from
the court-house steps requesting all who
desired the election to be called for the
southwestern to step to the right while
those in favor of the denver road should
step to the left and line up so they could be
counted

  when the line-up was completed the
denver supporters outnumbered the south-
western crowd four to one they were so
clearly a majority that it was not necessary
to count them and the election was ordered
for the denver memphis and atlantic peti-
tion joab then set about preparing peti-
tions for township bonds to be voted in aid
of his line and this was granted he went
back to topeka with a good sized flea buz-
zing in his ear however and he marked
out his future campaigns on the line of con-
ciliating the people instead of talking
against new railway propositions

borrowing a trainload of rails

thayers steel was delayed so he helped
himself to the first he could find

story is told of d j thayer chief
engineer of the fitzgerald s mal-
lory construction companv that was build-
ing the denver memphis and atlantic from
chetopa to larned

  the company had contracted for a lot of
steel from the joliet rail mills but the
twenty cars of rails which had been deliv-
ered to the santa fe at kansas city through
a mistake had been forwarded to some
point near dodge city larned i think it
was which though on the denver mem-
phis and atlantic line was several hundred
miles away from the point of delivery
the railroad builders



  s h mallory was fretting and pulling
his whiskers as if he wished that they be-
longed to mulvane instead of himself when
he heard that a shipment of twenty cars of
steel for the independence and southwestern
had been received by the missouri kansas
and texas at parsons to be sent up to
cherryvale to be delivered to the southern
kansas at that point

  mallorys son-in-law thayer was chief
engineer of the construction company they
had just received two new engines which
had been set up one of them had steam
on her and she was sent to the front about
five miles from chetopa where the denver
road crossed the katy

getting the steel

  the other was being tested when thayer
climbed on her with his superintendent of
construction and told the engineer that they
would run her up to parsons and have the
division master mechanic of the katy look
her over and see if anything was lacking

  now the engineer knew that there was
nothing the matter with the engine but
thayer was the boss and what he said had
to go all along the line so they ran out
onto the katy and traveled light to parsons
here the master mechanic looked the engine
over and said that she was all right and
then thayer asked him to go over to the
hotel for supper

  about ten oclock that night after the
southbound passenger had left parsons and
there was nothing more on the card until
along in the shank of the morning thayer
got a clearance for his engine running light
from parsons to chetopa the twenty cars
of santa fe steel were on a siding and
between it and the main line were the house
and wagon tracks

the operator gets busy

                               

  the denver engine had been set in on
the south end of the wagon track next to
that occupied by the steel cars thayer
told the engineer that he intended to steal
those rails and to pull out on the main line
and back down and hook on to them he
dropped the fireman to close the switch as
they pulled out with the steel and the super-
intendent of construction ran across to be
on hand to make the coupling

   they set the engine back as easily as pos-
sible and made the coupling and it was not

until they took up the slack and the cars
began to move that the night men in the
depot caught on to what they were doing

   the jolting of the cars as they straight-
ened out attracted the attention of the night
operator and he ran out with a lantern but
both the house and wagon tracks were occu-
pied by strings of box cars and he had to
climb through between these before he could
reach the track occupied by the cars of rails

  when he got there they were moving too
fast for him to catch on as the engineer had
pulled his engine wide open when he took
the slack so that the cars were running at
the rate of thirty miles an hour as they went
over the leads

i the fireman knew from the way the
engine started that if he expected to get
back to chetopa that night it was up to him
to get aboard and as she passed he swung
up the superintendent of construction had
climbed on the tank as soon as he had made
the coupling and they went on without
bothering about the fact that they had left
an open switch behind them

  there was no night operator at chetopa
at that time and the engineer kept up the
gait without easing up for curves or shut-
ting her off for the slopes

off the rails

   as soon as the operator found the cars of
rails were moving out he at once tumbled
to the little game that thayer was playing
he hustled across to the roundhouse where
there happened to be an engine under steam
and he ordered her out to catch the thieves

  when the engine came out she was headed
north and the boys did not stop to turn
her but set out after the denver gang run-
ning in the back motion all went well
until they struck the switch a brakeman
riding on the back of the tank with a lan-
tern to flag the way

  the switch was a stub and there was no
switch light so when the brakeman caught
a glimpse of the target by the light from
his lantern it was too late and the tender
went off the rails

  that settled the question of their ever
stopping the runaways and it was now a
case of hustle to get that engine back on the
track and out of the way of no  which
was due about three oclock and with all the
trucks of the tender off the boys had no
time to lose

thayer reached chetopa all right and




the railroad mans magazine

ran by the depot without stopping south
of the depot he whistled for the denver
switch the boss track-layer who knew
the sound of the two spots whistle ran out
and opened the switch and they ran on to
the denver memphis and atlantic rails
without slacking up

spiked down

  they concluded to pull on down to the
front and the boss track-layer seeing the
cars of rails going by routed out his men
so that when the  stopped for the switch
to be opened onto the main line they were
swarming over the cars like a lot of flies
over a saucer of molasses they ran the
cars on down to the end of the track and
stopped the rails were dumped on either
side and the empty cars were then pushed
back to chetopa and set on the siding

  the agent at parsons reported the taking
of the rails to the santa fe and then there
was wailing and gnashing of teeth and some
language but it did no good thayer
claimed that his steel was three weeks over-
due and that when he saw the stuff at par-
sons he naturally concluded that it was his
parsons was a division point and it was
only natural that it should be temporarily
set out there

  thayer wasted no time getting the rails
spiked to the ties as fast as his men and a
harris track-laying machine could hustle
the denver memphis and atlantic rails
were hurried back and the santa fe had to
take them in place of those thayer had bor-
rowed as the weight and section were the
same it made no material difference

cartters mistake

he needed bridge timbers and couldnt
wait till his own arrived

will cartter who has been a
bridge and railroad contractor for
forty years tells the following story

  now i dont want to boast but in the
s there were subsidy bonds to be earned
and it was up to the contractor to get things
ready for the track so the road could get
through in time for the bonds i had a
contract on a santa fe extension a a
robinson was then chief engineer and i
have never had a contract under a better
man he was as inflexible as steel but
absolutely just

   we had a lot of bridge timbers coming
to us over the santa fe lines but a wash-
out came on with the material on the wrong
side of the break my time was very short
and i had to get some kind of a structure
that would carry the rails across the cow-
skin a tributary of the salomon which was
a little dinky stream but as treacherous as
a copperhead

   while i was in this dilemma several
cars of bridge material bound to some point
west on the kansas pacific were side-
tracked at a little station near where i was
working i believe they were delayed by
defective draft rigging or something of the
sort

worked in the dark

   there was no night operator there and
the station closed at about eight oclock
along toward midnight i routed out my
men and teams and we sneaked over there
and unloaded every stick of that stuff as
fast as a wagon was loaded it would drive
away we worked in the dark using no
lanterns and i would not allow the men
to smoke lest the fire in their pipes should
be seen and attract the attention of some
prowler to what we were doing

   long before daylight we had the stuff
unloaded on either bank of the stream and
the teams were put up while the men went
to sleep

  bright and early i had the bridge gang
out and while they wondered a little at
the miraculous arrival of the material no
questions were asked and they settled down
to the work it was three miles to the sta-
tion and i heard nothing as none of the
men had occasion to go to the railroad and
i was busy rushing the work

  the next day the iron gangs were within
a mile of me and robinson came out to see
how we were getting along i told him we
would make it all right and would let the
track gangthrough on time he looked at
me a little quizzically and said that he
would order the bridge material sent to the
front i knew then that he was on all right
but said nothing

the agent buffaloed

  we got the temporary bridge in all
right and the track was laid across before
i went to the station the agent told me
that my bridge material was on the siding
i looked at him and said that he must be
the railroad builders



mistaken my material had arrived some
time before and i had unloaded it the same
night and took it out to the work

   the agent looked at me a moment and
ejaculated

  well by the jumping jehosaphat
here they have been jacking me up about
a lot of bridge material that was set out
here to be reloaded and sent on west on
account of defective cars and i swore by
all the gods that no bridge timber had ever
been left here nothing but half a dozen
empty flats

  the agent reported the arrival of the
missing material and was ordered to rush
it west on the next freight whether the
kansas pacific ever caught on i dont
know perhaps they did but as they had
plenty of bridge material they thought it
was not worth kicking up a row about
especially as i had the stuff already in the
structure and it would do them no good to
make a rumpus

    but i want to say here and now that i
firmly believe that it could get hotter rain
harder snow fiercer and the wind could
blow swifter in kansas than in any other
place in the universe

a race for a pass

general bryant had a great deal to say but
was not betraying any secrets

general j h bryant who died
in washington during the latter part
of november  was one of the old-time
western railroad men he built the seattle
and northwestern and was president of the
road until it was sold to the northern
pacific general bryant was a real gen-
eral and won his title during the civil
war in the union army he was an irish-
man and used to say there were only two
days in the year when he would wear a
silk hat-st patricks day and the fourth
of july

  he was a good railroad man and was
popular with the people along his line
and consequently the road was successful
under his management he never refused
an interview to any newspaper man who
requested it but he could talk more and
tell less than any man in the business
except jay gould

  he came into st paul one day on his
private car and there were rumors afloat
that the northern pacific was about to take
over the seattle and northwestern a
reporter called on him from the st paul
globe and sent in his card

  he interested the newspaper man so
much that he forgot all about the news
he had come to get when he looked over
his notes afterward he found that he had
material for a first-class article but not
one word about the rumored sale and trans-
fer of his line the general knew when
he came in what he was after and had
set about forestalling him

the other fellows stakes

  one of general bryants favorite yarns
was a story of an occurrence that happened
on some road in the west he did not
name the road it seems that two lines
were racing for a pass in the mountains
and the one that got its stakes set first
would hold the right of way

  one day the engineer in charge of one
of the parties was out ahead looking up
the line and he picketed his pony at noon
ate his lunch and lay down to take a nap
while the animal was browsing when he
woke up his pony was gone and he had
a long weary walk back to his camp

  it appeared that the engineer in charge
of the other party had ridden up and
seeing the other man asleep had led his
pony some distance away and turned him
loose the pony came into camp the next
day trailing his lariat if the object of
the prank was to delay the other party
and beat them to the pass it proved a
failure for the engineer who was forced
to walk jumped his party ahead ten mils
took up the line at the spot where he had
ended his reconnaissance and ran his line
into the pass he then went back and
filled up the gap and checked afterward
so that when the engineer in charge of the
second party reached the pass he found the
other fellows stakes he had to back up
on his line some twenty miles and run for
another hole in the hills with the result
that the road was several miles longer than
was originally intended

  how he squared it with the men higher
up no one ever found out

    this is the first of three papers on the adventures of the railroad builders and contractors
the second paper will appear next month

cromptons train-robber clue

 by j r stafford

          his determination to run down some forgotten
          outlaws didnt jibe with old tinkworths tangent

          s chief of the g and t railroad
companys western depart-
ment f secret service mr
crompton looked his part
admirably he was tall
well-formed active ap-
parently fifty years old he had mild gray
eyes and mustache six
inches long his manner
was unobtrusive-almost
deferential-and he wore
at his belt as was proper
for him a pair of large
white-handled pistols the
holsters of which sagged
half-way to his knees

  in short he could have
posed for what might be
termed the latest stand-
ardized american man
hunter - but crompton
never posed

  as was to be expected
his record with the g
and t fully measured up
to his appearance in his
twelve years as chief de-
tective the company had
suffered the robbery of
only two trains and that
was away back in hi first
year

  other robberies had
been attempted - two
others-but both ha d
failed they failed be-
cause crompton after the first two hold-
ups always rode with the big shipments of
valuable express on each occasion when
the train was stopped he quietly slid back
the door of the express-car before the ban-
dits ordered it opened and each time with



the same calm disregard of what they might
want him to do he opened fire with a pump-
gun into the surrounding darkness

  each time too after he had thus bom-
barded the right-of-way he quietly dropped
to the ground a pistol in each hand and
waited on the field until daylight

  the second and last
time finding a trail he
had followed it and
coming up later with a
nondescript character who
claimed to be a sheep-
herder he had marched
him back to civilization
and the law

  though it was after-
ward proved that the
prisoner really was a
mere sheep - herder and
quite innocent his sheep
it seemed had followed
the trail of the bandits
obliterating it but leaving
his own trail clear the
moral effect of cromp-
tons act was in nowise
lessened every one said
well what of it if
it had been the robbers
crompton would have
followed them just the
same and he would have
caught them or fought to
the last ditch

  without doubt this
was a correct estimate of the man the gen-
eral advertising of it speedily resulted in
train robbery  the g and t becoming a
thing of the past for train-robbers only op-
erate where the chances are at least even
that they will meet with no resistance

the latest standardized american
man-hunter
cromptons train-robber clue-



  as for crompton all the to-do over him
over his bravery and all made not a whit
of difference really it rather annoyed him
for he was a modest fellow and so honest
that when he was dragged into the business
of talking about himself as frequently hap-
pened he always felt it his duty to apolo-
gize for the blunder he had made in arrest-
ing the sheep-herder

  he usually made his apology after this
fashion  awh yeah but openin on fel-
lers with buckshot when they air figgerin
on ye handin em a large sum o money
that haint much it dont make up fur
some other things a detective ort to know
clues if e does he alius gits the right
parties

  then as a rule he would sadly conclude 
 e never lets em git plumb away

  this last dictum referred directly to the
first year of his service when the two rob-
beries had occurred the perpetrators of
those two robberies had never been appre-
hended worse yet the identities of the ban-
dits had never yet been ascertained

  now it must be admitted that the escape
of the miscreants in each instance might
have been prevented very easily the first
time crompton took all of his men and
scoured the desert but the robbers undoubt-
edly left the country on one of the g and
ts own trains

  the second time in an attempt to profit
by his former discomfiture he put all his
men guarding trains and terminals and the
thieves rode out of arizona and into old
mexico on nothing fleeter than some broken-
down pack-mules

  of course crompton really did make a
mistake each time-as any one else in this
world might have done-but unlike many
another man on finding himself hailed with
praises later on he did not forget per-
haps cromptons ideal of efficiency was
really too high

  at any rate he worried over those fail-
ures strove to improve himself along the
lines of his weakness and about every two
or three months he would come into the
office of brasfield manager of the g and
ts transmountain lines and would say
to him i haint sure that im the right
feller in the right place after all

  to this brasfield who was a big rough
man of highly developed commercial in-
stinct always made this sort of answer
 go along with that you big simpleton
i dont want any sherlock holmes what

i want is a man who wont an work
to be made for your story- detectives
shippers and travelers dontatronze a
road for its record on catching thieves
theyd rather patronize a line thj aint
given to sensations see so you gt out
of here go off and clean up your pis
or something an leave me alone 
work to do here take a cigar and ofe  n

  then as always crompton ojuav
held his peace took the cigar and wenp-
way-not to clean his pistols however but
to read or rather to study the latest detect-
ive story or the press despatches which
contained news of the bolder variety of
robbery

  as a result of all this persistency and in
the face of every ones good-natured tolera-
tion crompton like any other man who
follows his ideal alone acquired much in-
formation and some rather curious theories

  for instance he knew the names general
characteristics and the records of practi-
cally all the men who had robbed trains
west of the missouri river again he could
locate all the hiding-places of the organized
bands and he had a fairly good idea of the
trails leading thereto from well-known hole-
in-the-wall to the more obscure fastnesses
of horseshoe in southern utah and the
roost which is in western arizona

  so far as his limitations would allow
for he was not a ready or a close reasoner
he had gained some familiarity with the
processes of deductive reasoning as applied
by the detectives whose names appear in
best sellers and as the crowning achieve-
ment of all his researches he had formu-
lated a theory by which he hoped some day
to retrieve for his early mistakes

  his theory was this some day the
men who had robbed the g and t would
look back to their ease of escape and con-
clude that it might be safe to try again

  to be sure he knew that they would not
try unless they could work some scheme to
get his attention directed elsewhere

  crompton was not quite an egotist in this
he really believed that if he were in an ex-
press-car with a repeating shotgun in his
hands he could stand off all the robbers that
ever got together for a hold-up it was be-
cause he believed this that he had made it
win and believing that train-robbers are
rational men not running up to a man just
to get shot he felt very certain of his con-
clusion that they would make an effort to
outwit him


he railroad mans magazine

hey would make some sort of demon-
stration in a given place and when he went

	to see but it they would strike in
anther garter

 f   vpton confidently expected all this
 -toting he had planned how to meet it
  n the first place he would send some of
 -eliable young men with the train that
 nndits evidently designed to attack
 ie would go himself to the scene of
 demonstration find out who of the
 jang had done this part of the work and
 afterward he would keep that man under
 such close surveillance that in time he would
 be able to connect all of the band with
 the fact of crime and convict them to the
 last man

   it must not be supposed that crompton
intended a robbery to take place not at
all he merely intended to get a clue-a
clue which would lead him to the perpetra-
tors of those two robberies which every one
else but himself had forgotten

   consequently he went on his habitual
way studying his books and papers in
leisure moments and when on duty guard-
ing his bullion shipments by sitting upon
them with a loaded shotgun in his hands
and the big pistols loosed in their holsters
at his waist

  wherever he went no matter what he
was doing he had that air of quiet watch-
fulness which a man assumes only when he
has watched and waited for years

   it was only logical therefore that one
 night as he was riding eastward in an ex-
 press-car with two of his men carrying a
 particularly heavy shipment from the san
 francisco mint he should have been more
 than usually alert for this particular ship-
 ment was big enough to tempt all the bandits
 in the west

   therefore he was not surprised when the
 train stopped at homan flats and the sta-
 tion-agent rushed out and thrust into his
 hands a telegram that read as follows

     engine number  with tender stolen
   from roundhouse at falls and run west on
   main line local offices fifty miles west
   closed for night so cannot wire derail instruc-
   tions probably the work of hold-ups who
   either intend to let engine run into your train
   wild and wreck it or else wished to take large
   party into rough country along grapevine and
   hold you up look out wire any instruc-
   tions you see fit for our cooperation at this
   end

 i aint got no instructions for em

crompton advised the waiting station-
agent  only ye might tell em seein theyll
probably worry about it that there haint
a goin to be no wreck nor no robbery

  he rolled the door shut and beckoning
his two men into the forward end of the
car said to them

  now when we git to where that engine
is im a goin to hop off they haint a
goin to be no robbers aroundthere at all
naw sir theyll be up the line i figger
about forty or fifty mile beyond falls in
the paint hills they haint a bit o doubt
either but what theyll stick ye up

   im a goin to count on you boys to do
what ive done myself a couple o times
the two of ye can do it easy one o ye
jist open the door the minute the train stops
and the othern without waitin to say
 good evenin gents or  what kin i do fur
ye  wants to jist open with the pump-
gun pintin it sorter lowlike and shootin
in a different place ever time

   them foolsll be figgerin o course
that its me they air afeard of but by the
time yeve raked all the hillside around
there with buckshot theyll have a different
idee theyll know that it wasnt me they
was skeered of at all theyll reecollect that
it was the shotgun that was liable to git
em into trouble an theyll dig out

  now when ye git done shootin jist
close up the door an dont neither of ye git
out it wont be necessary i got a surer
an a better way o ketchin em besides
you fellers is young an foolhardy an ye
might foller em off an git into a box

  both were young and both were fool-
hardy they were delighted with the task
he had set them but after a moments
jubilatipii over their opportunity to do
something approximating the greatness of
their chief jackson asked - but say cap
sposen the hull bunch is with that engine
whatll you do bein by yerself you ort
to let us have a chance to hep ye

  humph crompton grunted yer
a mighty young man jackson an though
i haint sayin that im a better detective
right now than you air - for the lord
knows you haint never let nobody git away
from ye as i have-im bound to say that
this job im aimin at now is what ye might
call first-class

  an if i git it done as i figger i will
you lads is goin to have full credit for
your share in it o course what im ask-
in ye to do is as ye might say the rough
cromptons train-robber clue



work but its important jist the same-
jist as important as the fine work i aim to
do so dont ye sabe that yer helpin me
the best way ye kin by jist ridin right
straight ahead  

  of course they did not understand and
of course they said as much-but they got
nothing out of him

  a man who has planned a coup for ten
years does not communicate it even to his
lieutenants until he has need of their as-
sistance then he tells them as much as is
necessary and no more

  an hour later when the engine ahead of
them whistled for a train without the right
of way and crompton peeped ahead and
saw what he knew must be the headlight
of the stolen locomotive he said as he pre-
pared to alight

   whichever of you fellers does the shoot-
in i wish ye wouldnt go to no extra pains
about killin anybody if ye killed em
they wouldnt be no ketchin of em an
im powerful set on ketching them fellers
by high-class work id jist like to do
somethin once that id have a right to be
proud of

  opening the door a little farther he
dropped off the now slowly moving train

  running alongside he came to the cab
just as the fireman was getting down to go
forward and ascertain what was meant by
an engine standing dead still on a siding
which was never used for anything ex-
cept as a derail for cars accidentally
breaking loose from trains

   burgess crompton said persua-
sively  you leave that there to me its
jist a engine it haint got no cars hang-
ing on behind onto the main track you
fellers go ahead slow if ye want to but
dont ye stop if ye do ye are mighty
apt to spile something for me they
haint a going to be no trouble here so
you fellers jist go on

  burgess laughed and so did the engi-
neer

   all right old horse the engineer
agreed  i haint lost nothin up there
and im danged glad to skin by if you say
so an seem it was a train-bandit warn-
ing i reckon youre the boss so here
we go

  the fireman crawled back up the steps
a moment later the drivers were spinning
merrily by the time the train had gone
half a mile it was well under way

  crompton smiled to himself and plodded

up between the rails toward motionless
headlight approaching wiin forty feet
of it and still well out of th-zone f ts
rays he sat down and listened ater half
an hour during which time he did tp hear
a sound-except the cinders dropping-from
the grate-bars as happens when the firis
going out-he crept up closer and closk
until at length he put his hand on the step

  he listened for a long time he heard

all this was merely the pretense of a
legitimate occupation

nothing finally realizing that the engine
was quite deserted he crawled up into the
cab and made himself comfortable on the
engineers cushions

  he did this very carefully so as to dis-
turb nothing of course he had hoped to
find a bandit or two failing that he still
had hope of finding some clue to the iden-
tity of the one who had stolen the engine


 the railroad mans magazine

   his wish thep-eforei was more than grat-
 ified at the cjming of daylight he then
 found on tve floor of the cab a mans hat
 an empty whisky bottle and an empty
 grain-bjg on which was stenciled in big
 red letters  hy tinkworth

   iis if this were not quite enough when
  iie got down to examine his find and
 chanced to look back into the tender he
 saw mr tinkworth sprawled on the coal
 apparently dead-drunk

   with all haste crompton slipped from
the cab to the ground he knew mr tink-
worth

   tinkworth was about the most unregen-
erate old rascal along the whole line of the
g and t he was somewhere past sixty
years of age had never done an honest
days work in his life but always had
money and when not actually doing some
devilment was drunk

   moreover he was an exceedingly clever
 rascal- always wriggling out of his mis-
 deeds entirely or else getting off with the
 very lightest of punishments he always
 had some sort of a plausible excuse which
 tickled the jury once when he had been
 arrested for stealing a horse he had made it
 appear that he only wanted the halter
 while guilty of stealing small articles he
 had never committed a crime that would
 approximate grand larceny

   therefore crompton wanted to get away
 without being discovered he believed as
 every one else did that tinkworth must
 be hand in glove with all the rascals in the
 country and reasoned that if the old fellow
 learned that his part in the stealing of the
 engine was known all communication be-
 tween him and his confederates would cease

   to be sure crompton could place him
under arrest for theft and sweat him
but that wasnt the way crompton wanted
to work moreover tinkworth was not
the sort of man who perspired information
freelv either as to his associations or enter-

        j 

 prises

   beyond doubt it seemed wise to hurry
away crompton hurried

   about nine oclock that morning having
 flagged down a through freight and board-
 ed it mr crompton alighted at falls
 there he learned even before making in-
 quiries that the express - train had been
 held up in the paint hills and tht only
 the haste or ignorance of the robbers had
 saved the thousands of dollars in the safe

   he was also apprised of the fact that

jackson and miller-the other lad he had
counted on - simply had forgotten their
guns and his orders and that the bandits
had made a very easy escape

   theyre probably somewhere in the
paint hills the superintendent of the di-
vision suggested and if youd take a
posse up there from here and have the
trains watched they couldnt get away
crompton shook his head modestly
naw ive tried them tricks twice an
diey wont work but ive got em with the
goods on i reckon this time thats what
i was doin that i wasnt with the train
well youd better have been with the
train the superintendent advised

  the superintendent like brasfield had
no sympathy for cromptons artistic ideals
still he had great respect for cromptons
record so he concluded well do as you
want i reckon you know your own job
best are you going to tant any extta
trains or men or anything

  naw nothin i jist want as little said
as possible till i git ready i aim to git
the whole works-them fellers from away
back too-at one swipe

  the superintendent who had almost for-
gotten those robberies of bygone years
laughed incredulously but said nothing
it was not his place to criticize the plans of
a man whose work had been a success as
cromptons had been however suddenly
recalling the theft of engine no  he
asked about it

   ive looked into that crompton re-
plied with the nearest approximation to van-
ity he had ever been guilty of an be-
tween you an me an the gate-post that
engine was takened jist for a blind sabe
the superintendent understood now
that he came to think of it the stealing of
a locomotive was a most improbable sort of
larceny so he slapped crompton on the
back and congratulated him and then
asked  but how did you happen to think
of that  

   humph a feller thats been a groan-
ing in sperrit ye might say for ten years
over his early mistakes has a right to git
somewhere- if he digs for it

  in a hoarse whisper he explained his
long-cherishecl theory and wound up with
his discovey of tinkworth in the cab

   you ought to have nabbed him the
superintendent said amazed at the work-
ing out of the theory he could not help
thinking of the companys interests the
cromptons train-robber clue



old devil may get off with that engine yet
no telling but what hell drive it on over to
homan flats and sell the coal in the ten-
der he might get a train wrecked dont
you see it would be like him to come up
with some sort of a tale of that kind-that
he stole the engine for the coal in it as he
stole the horse for the halter crompton
you ought to have nabbed him

  again crompton whispered and at

  having run through his scrap-book to
find out if any of the noted american train-
robbers had ever been heard of as inhab-
itants of arkansas - tinkworths native
state-and finding no evidence of such he
left the hotel and went to tinkworths
shack

  this was situated on the edge of town
somewhat apart from any other house
around it grew rows of irrigated sunflow-

he grinned with such obvious delight
that they all knew he was not
going to lose anything

length the superintendent seeing the whole
plan and astounded at the vastness of it
went down on his knees in apology

   ill wire brasfield he said as he trot-
ted off  that youve got em all

  for the first time in many years cromp-
ton strode along the platform in real pride
passing down the street he met the recreant
jackson and miller in front of his hotel
they tried to avoid him but he smiled pa-
tiently at them and generously said

   i hadnt ort to have sent you kids on
sich a job i might ha knowed ye wasnt
hardened to shootin human beins down
an aayway i dont mind except on yerown
account well git em anyhow

  without pausing to demand their shame-
ful confession he went up to his room

ers forming a most complete screen for the
seeing eyes of the passer-by

  without hesitation crompton entered the
premises and made a thorough search of
them he found nothing except evidence
of old tinkworths masterly shrewdness

  there were several piles of old iron in the
back yard some ragged bales of discarded
rubber-boots in the kitchen and in various
corners and odd nooks of the other room
were pieces of brass castings all this of
course was merely the pretense of a legiti-
mate occupation old tinkworth pretend-
ed that he was a junk gatherer

  crompton returned to his hotel for ten
days he patiently waited the return of old
tinkworth on the tenth day however
there was plenty of excitement not only


the railroad mans magazine

did old tinkworth return but what was
almost unbelievable mr brasfield appeared
on the scene mr brasfield left no doubt
as to the reason for his coming

  he called crompton into the division su-
perintendents room in a voice that might
have been heard all over the building he
demanded

  now say have you gone and let em
get away again  

  crompton of course whispered

   thunderation  roared brasfield  the
public has forgotten all about those old rob-
beries and i dont want em recalled even
if you get the robbers why dont you nail
this old rooster and send him up thatll
satisfy everybody that the whole gang has
been caught why confound it weve lost
ten thousand dollars worth of business
just because of that robbery week before 
last say youve got to do something or
were going to be ruined go right now
and pull that old rascal and send him up

  this was quite disconcerting to obey
brasfield would not result in the capture of
real train - bandits crompton shook his
head and argued naw id ruther not
do that tinkworth haint no ginooine
bandit we could send im up but if we
did-well that would be the end of it

   thats what i want send im up i
want the thing ended it will get into the
papers thats the main thing

  when brasfield wanted a thing done
there had to be a good reason why it wasnt
done

  knowing this but resolved to make the
best of his situation crompton began to
bargain

  well say he declared lemme arrest
im an offer to let im off if hell turn
states evidence agin the rest o the gang

i	know where to find whoever it is and
ill go an git em

  for a moment mr brasfield remained
undecided then he agreed all right
thats logical go get him while i bring
the district attorney

  half an hour later brasfield with the
district attorney and crompton with old
tinkworth met secretly in the prosecutors
office in the court-house

  the lawyer a young man anxious to win
renown as one who could ferret out and
convict train-robbers of ten years immu-
nity was in high spirits

  old tinkworth who had been arrested
in a saloon where he had just finished bibu-

lous preparations for a tremendous spree
also seemed to be feeling that life was one
grand and glorious holiday crompton
noting this was in the seventh heaven of
anticipation drunks he knew are apt to
talk freely

  mr brasfield seeing everything grew
very glum

  now said the prosecutor with great
severity tinkworth weve got you with
the goods on ive prepared an indictment
against you for complicity in the paint
hills hold-up you are charged with being
an accessory before the fact you cant get
away fromit that you stole that engine and
ran it off down onto the derail - switch
thirty miles west of here on the night of
the robbery you can be sent to the pen for
the larceny of that engine or again for
unlawful appropriation of the property of
a common carrier or for doing such acts as
constitute a menace to the lives and prop-
erty of the patrons of that common carrier
or again-

   hold on old tinkworth wearily re-
plied as drunken men sometimes will when
they cannot follow what is being said to
them let that go till some other time ill
jist take ver word for it if ye say im
guilty o everthing i reckon i am

   or again the prosecutor went on
 we can send you up for-for-

  recalling that he had completed the cata-
logue of tinkworths crimes he concluded
somewhat lamely well heres what i
jiropose to do ill dismiss the information
against you which would make an indict-
ment for larceny of the engine or threaten-
ing the lives of travelers and ill just
charge you with loeing an accessory to the
train-robberv provided youll agree to tell
all you know about that robbery what do
you say to that  

  old tinkworths sodden features sharp-
ened with sudden eagerness really it
seemed that he never could get so drunk
but that he always saw his chance the
prosecutor smiled grimly crompton al-
most swelled mr brasfield even looked
expectant

  then tinkworth suddenly declared  all
right ill go ye if i lose but he grinned
with such obvious delight that they all
knew he was not going to lose anything
recalling his past misdeeds and the ingen-
ious methods through which he had al-
ways wriggled out of diem they all laughed

  when the necessary papers were signed
cromptons train-robber clue



crompton who had prepared his questions
seated himself in a chair beside the old
rascal and with no thought of humor now
propounded well hy what dye know
about that robbery  

   nothin came the drunken answer
nothin shouted crompton you
tell about that as ye agreed er well convict
ye for swipin the engine

   caint tell nothin moren i know
tinkworth replied with the somber gravity
of a man deeply inebriated an i dont
know nothin

   well then seein thats too direct for
ye ye bein drunk gimme the straight o
why ve takened the engine  

  sure said tinkworth with imper-
turbable dignity since he knew that he was
safe in the confession  i been a wantin
to steal a engine for a long time been
thinkin about it for ten year ye might say
well that night id jist got a check for a
lot o old copper wire an gittin on a pow-
erful jag i sorter lost my judgment an so
i started it was a powerful fool thing to
think o doin but he added with a sly
grin it seems im a gittin off with it
here suddenly demanded brasfield
whose patience was quite exhausted  why
did you want to steal an engine  

  awh say now old tinkworth de-
manded solemnly what would a feller
want to steal a engine for dye think
hed want it to play with i reckon not
hed want it to git the brass offn it theys
over a hunderd dollars worth o brass on
one of em

  did you get the brass the manager
demanded

  awh sure i did i got it sold too
an ye might say i was gittin drunk on
them brass-works when crompton fetched
me up here

   crompton ordered mr brasfield you
go and call up the master-mechanic and all
the roundhouse men that had anything to
jlo with that engine after it came back
crompton did so totteringly and in re-
sponse to that summons the men soon ap-
pea red

   ragon said brasfield to the master-
mechanic was there any brass-work miss-
ing on that engine when you got it back
that engine which was stolen a week ago 
any missin snorted ragon that
aint a proper way o speakin about it
we been a huntin ever since to see if they
was even a brass rivet left about her

  then seeing old tinkworth and sudden-
ly recalling certain baffling suspicions which
he had held for a long time ragon shout-
ed and that danged old rat was the
feller that done it i know im im onto
him now say he makes his livin swipin
oil-cups an castins

  crompton and the district attorney crum-
pled down in their chairs but mr brasfield
did not he arose and galloped up and
down the room three or four times at
length he wheeled on crompton and said
if ever i hear of you trying any more
of this detective business ill fire you
dont you monkey with it again

  humbly mr crompton arose his pride
was gone-he was the same old crompton
now but a little more chastened more un-
obtrusive more mild than ever before
putting on his hat he bowed obediently

  a lifelong hope or a lifelong ideal must
perish tragically it was but natural
therefore as he started out of the room that
he should sigh heavily and say

   o course i can go on as long as i live
a herdin fellers off with a shotgun-but
thats nothin id like to make a record
that a feller could take some pride in

according to the industrial world the
new steel three-span cantilever bridge over
the kuskulana river in alaska built by the cop-
per river and northwestern company is the

great american train
robberies

by howard morris

to the series of gripping hold-up tales already published in the rail-
road mans magazine dealing with historic desperadoes who have
plundered railroad trains ever since the first steel trails were stretched
across the prairies we now add xo  it is the story of two cold-blooded
desperate men who measure up well with the worst outlaws of the past

    the looting of the crack train of the harriman system was more than
a surprise people who sit in the electric-lighted drawing-rooms of the lux-
urious hotels-on-wheels are little apt to think of the daredevil feats of jesse
james and the younger gang except in the light of an entertaining novel
to while away the after-dinner hour those who parted with their valuables
on a west-bounci overland limited last january had the unusual experience of
being dumped from romance to reality in a remarkable short space of time

no -the hold-up of the overland limited

daring feat of two outlaws carried to success by coolness and delib-
eration though marked with deeds of violence
and utter brutality

the palatial train of the harriman system
which runs between chicago and san
francisco arrived in ogden utah six
hours late at this point the train leaves
the union pacific tracks and on the right-
of-way of the southern pacific company
begins the last lap of its two-thousand-
mile journey

 the train consisted of a combination
baggage and dynamo - car six pullman
sleepers a diner and an observation-car
railroad posters and gtiides proclaim the
train a veritable palace on wheels and in-
deed it offers conveniences to tourists which
are not to be had everywhere its arrival
in ogden so far behind its schedule was

began in the october  railroad mans magazine single copies  cents



              pleasant thoughts accompa-
nied the mental evolutions
of engineer ed rouse when
he saw that the light of
an automatic semaphore was
blazing out red against his
six-hours late overland limited yet it
never occurred to him that this tantalizing
state of affairs was the initial happening
in a series of sensational events which a
short time later would result in his gazing
into the muzzle of a sawed-off shotgun
along the barrels of which glistened two
beady eyes peering over an improvised
handkerchief mask

  on the evening of january  


the railroad mans magazine

a most unusual proceeding and when the
new crew stepped aboard it was with the
avowed intention of diminishing this last
time or at least to maintaining schedule
speed while the train was in their charge

  at  pm engineer rowse opened
the throttle and the limited started west
the light of the junction city soon faded
in the rear and on the level road-bed ap-
proaching the lucin cut-off which stretches
across great salt lake the limited sped
at a rate of sixty miles an hour

  most of the passengers had retired for
the night and there was a stillness
throughout the train that was broken only
by the monotonous rumble of wheels con-
ductor w a middleton had checked up
his tickets and the result showed twenty-
seven passengers aboard

  six miles west of ogden the engineer
whistled at west weber and three miles
farther on rowse again opened the screech-
valve for reese siding between these sta-
tions there is a block governed by auto-
matic semaphores at either end

  one mile and a half east of the home
signal at reese station is an intermediate
semaphore

  there is nothing else to mark this par-
ticular spot there being no habitations of
any kind in sight the land on either
side of the track is barely worth the tilling
for in wet seasons it is flooded by an in-
land sea and is too soaked with salt water
to be fertile it is altogether a bleakz
desolate place but to those on the speed-
ing train this made little difference for the
scene was hidden by darkness even to the
passenger who might be finishing a last
cigar in the smoking-compartment

stopped by the semaphore

  his eyes riveted upon the glistening
track ahead rowse sat silently in his cab
until with a start of alarm he perceived
the intermediate semaphore just east of
reese piercing the night with its single
red eye of danger reluctantly he closed
the throttle and applied the air

  the chance of making up jost time went
glimmering as the brake-shfles gripped the
steel tires and the train came to a dead
stop alongside the signal-stand head
brakeman william cross alighted from
the front coach and by the aid of his
lantern groped his way past the engine
and down the track to ascertain the trouble

  a hundred yards ahead of the locomo-
tive he waved a faint assurance with his
lantern and the engineer caused the train
to creep along in the wake of the hurry-
ing brakeman thus for a mile and a half
the overland limited already desperately
behind time was man-paced toward the
modest station of reese there they found
the home-signal was clear indicating that
the fault was merely a defect in the mech-
anism of the intermediate semaphore

  the head brakeman climbed aboard the
train and the man at the throttle gave two
short blasts on the whistle

  in another minute the overland limited
would have been on its way but something
happened to prevent engineer rowse from
carrying but his intentions the brakes
suddenly gripped the wheels and the train
could not be moved

warned of the hold-up

   well this beats the dutch came with
disgusted vehemence from the lips of the
engineer first its the signal and now
its the air ill have to go back and find
out whats the matter

   vo better not go back der mister
engineer said a voice with unmistakable
ethiopian accents from the top of the ten-
der engineer and fireman looked up and
saw an ashen-hued pullman porter climb-
ing toward them

   ders robbers got this ver train and
dey is killin all the porters what they kin
fin devs already killed mister davis
and dey has shot mister taylor sos he
cant live they is robbin all de people
better not go back mister engineer

  there was no mistaking the true pur-
port of the frightened porters words yet
disregarding his warning engineer rowse
coolly lighted his torch and climbed from
the cal he worked his way slowly back
along the coaches peering at the couplings
and hose connections as he went stand-
ing on the track behind the last coach was
brakeman cross his lantern lighting a
little circle of the bleak surroundings

flagman made prisoner

  the engineer who there discovered and
closed the open angle-cock which had set the
brakes was again told that the train was
in the hands of bandits neither of the
trainmen was armed yet they decided to
great american train robberies



  enter one of the cars and learn more of the
  robbery which was then taking place

   when the train had stopped at the
 first semaphore almost a half hour before
 flagman h h hancock who had gone
 back to flag the rear-end was in the act of
 responding to five short blasts of the whistle
 when unforeseen circumstances prevented

- he had just grasped the hand-rails when
 his attention was arrested by the gruff
 order throw up your hands

    still holding to one hand-rail he turned
  to gaze behind him and found a double-
  barreled shotgun pointing at his head with
  the muzzle not more than three feet awav

   without waiting for further explanation he
  complied with the order

    at the side and only a few feet to the
  rear of his companion the flagman dis-
  covered a second bandit for such he real-
  ized the men to be the two men had sud-
  denly appeared at the rear of the train like
  darker shadows which had detached them-
  selves from the surrounding gloom

   the train was already moving when
 flagman hancock received his second com-
 mand which was to get on board he
 obeyed with alacrity and was closely fol-
 lowed up the steps by his two unwelcome
 acquaintances standing on the wide rear-
 platform of the observation-car hancock
 with his hands again extended skyward
 was able by the aid of the dim light from
 the drawing-room lamps to make a more
 careful scrutiny of the bandits

ready for business

    one of the pair was more than six feet
  tall with stooped shoulders and a gaunt
  slender form he was dressed in black
  and wore a short shabby overcoat with col-
  lar turned up his companion was sev-
  eral inches shorter and of more rotund
  proportions

    he was apparently darker in complexion
  than the other but his clothes were of the
  same hue and he too wore an overcoat
  both wore caps which partly covered their
  ears and foreheads and the lower portion
  of their faces was masked with large blue
  handkerchiefs

    about each mans waist was a cartridge-
  belt with two automatic revolvers of heavy
  caliber and in their hands they carried
  sawed-off shotguns there could be no mis-
  taking their motive in thus boarding the
  train

  the train robbers did not tarry outside
the coach for be it known that their inten-
tion was to complete the looting of the train
before its slow progress brought it to the
home signal at reese siding with a
warning to hancock they pushed on into
the train from the first berth the robbers
seized a pillow-slip and handing this re-
ceptacle to the flagman they began the
sacking of the train

shot in cold blood

  coming to the smoking-compartment at
the end of the third pullman the shorter
bandit attempted to push ojben the door it
did not yield to his first effort and believ-
ing that some of the passengers had barri-
caded themselves in the little room the
bandits prepared for trouble throwing
the weight of his stocky body against the
door it flew open and the short bandit
lunged into the compartment with his shot-
gun ready for instant use

  he was surprised to find only two negro
porters william davis and w a taylor
who had entered the room to eat their mid-
night lunch unmindful of what was taking
place on the train both men jumped to
their feet with exclamations of alarm when
the bandit burst in upon them

  whatll we do with these porters
asked the shorter of the outlaws evidently
believing that the colored men had opposed
his entrance to the room

  kill em-theyre only niggers an-
swered the taller desperado with an oath
and acting upon these brutal words the
short train robber fired pointblank at the
two men

  both negroes dropped to the floor of the
car the heavy buckshot from the bandits
gun had pierced daviss heart and he died
without a struggle taylors right arm was
shattered by part of the charge and though
he did not lose consciousness he lay beside
the dead body of his companion feigning
death until the murderers had passed on
out of the narrow passage and into the next
car

taught in a trap

  that flagman hancock did not share
the fate of davis shortly afterward is most
remarkable while the attention of both
bandits was temporarily occupied by the
negroes hancock still in possession of the


the railroad mans magazine

sack containing the valuables so far col-
lected made a dash for liberty he ran
ahead through three cars and would prob-
ably have left the train had he had time to
open a vestibule door for unfortunately all
were closed

  he had scarcely vanished when the taller
bandit discovered his absence and both
robbers gave chase upon reaching the rear
platform of the baggage-car hancock found
the door locked and here he was overtaken
by the outlaws

  considering their murderous deed of a
few minutes before it would have seemed
most natural for them to send a charge of
buckshot into the flagmans body but with
a volley of oaths they ordered him to come
on back and finish up his work reluc-
tantly hancock preceded the bandits back
to the point where they had paused in their
robbing to commit murder

  fiction writers have clothed the bandits
of the west with more or less chivalry the
marauders of the overland limited were
not bandits of fiction and even the crude
chivalry which attaches itself to many of
the tales of the james boys cannot be cred-
ited to these men their entire trip through
the train was marked by coarse brutality

no regard for women

  women passengers were greeted with
curses and vilest insults and some clothed
only in their sleeping garments were jerked
roughly from berths and forced to drop
their jewels arid money into the yawning
sack held by the flagman

  one woman who indignantly resented
the intrusion of the robbers into her berth
and who refused to take off her rings at the
request of the masked men was dealt a
vicious blow with the butt of a revolver
her valuables were then taken and she was
left in a faint upon the floor

  a traveling salesman who had not yet
retired was reading a newspaper when the
outlaws approached from the rear and
ordered him to throw up his hands be-
wildered by such an unexpected order the
salesman stared dumbly at the train rob-
bers until the shorter bandit struck him a
blow over the head with the barrel of his
shotgun

  this man dropped more than a hundred
dollars into the plunder-poke and he gave
a last wistful look at his watch and two-
carat kimberley stone which had gleamed

from a tiffany setting on his middle finger
as he bade them good-by

  conductor middleton in the front pull-
man was informed of the hold-up by the
fleeing porter as he scurried past on his
way to the engine middleton is small in
stature and has been in the service of the
southern pacific a score of years what he
lacks in height he makes up in dignity

face to face with them

  the startling words of the colored man
caused him to arise from his seat twist one
of the frail ends of his gray mustache nerv-
ously and start toward the rear of the train
like the captain of a ship he deemed it his
duty to face any danger that might be lurk-
ing incidentally he transferred his time-
piece from his vest to his hip pocket

  in the next car he came face to face with
the plunderers

  dig up was the laconic salutation
that greeted him and the sack now growing
heavy with its booty was held in an accom-
modating position by its unwilling custo-
dian what change the conductor had in
his pockets he dropped into the proffered
sack

  put in your watch he was roughly
ordered

   i forgot my watch this trip he lied
boldly pulling back his coat that they
might see the vacant pockets of his vest

  the taller man stepped to his side with
an oath

  better give it up whispered hancock
who knew the brutal temperament of the
men middleton was trifling with

his timepiece is taken

  the tall bandit reached forward seized
the conductor by his mustache and nearly
tore the facial decoration out by its roots
a cry of pain escaped the distorted lips of
the trainman his hand moved speedily to
his hip pocket and came forth with the hid-
den watch

  middleton joined hancock as a prisoner
and under the guns of the enemy marched
forward as he was bid it was shortly
after this incident and before the bandits
had completed their canvass of the pas-
sengers that the slow progress of the lim-
ited was momentarily checked followed by
two blasts of the whistle

realizing that the train had reached the
great american train robberies



home signal at reese siding and that flag-
man cross had found the block clear the
train robbers thwarted engineer rowses
intention of proceeding by setting the air
against him

   when the last coach was looted and the
end door of the baggage-car was reached
the robbers ordered that the door be opened
but as it remained closed they did not
endeavor to force it but compelled the train-
men to open the vestibule door leading from
the train

  as soon as they got outside hancock was
relieved of the plunder which in cash and
valuables amounted to more than three
thousand dollars he was then forced with
the conductor to lead the way toward the
engine here again the masked men dis-
played a knowledge of railroading the
taller man climbing into the engine-cab
ordered fireman mclean to pull ahead
and clear the switch

  following the orders so threateningly
delivered the fireman turned the steam into
the cylinders until the train moved ahead
a few car-lengths

what the engineer found

  let us return to the engineer and the
rear-brakeman who but a few minutes be-
fore this movement of the train climbed
aboard the rear platform the engineer
boldly opened the door and the two train-
men entered the train to find every person
in the last pullman with his hands extended
upward the bandits were gone but the
passengers hypnotized by fear were still
obeying their orders engineer rowse
could not repress a smile-grim humor
though it was

  whats the matter with you people
he asked

  train robbers exclaimed the boldest
in the coach and at the words the others
attempted to reach higher into the air

  theyre gone now assured the train-
man  better give your arms a rest

  they are in the next car ventured a
passenger and not a hand was lowered

  engineer rowse left the car by the rear
door and began walking back to his engine
the train jerked and strained at its brakes
and then moved slightly ahead this phe-
nomenon led the engineer to believe that the
robbers must be on the engine for the fire-
man of his own volition would not attempt
to move the train

  rowse hurried ahead two of his fellow
trainmen stood near the locomotive with
their hands above their heads but he had
grown accustomed to this pose and it elic-
ited no further smile he did not speak
holding his torch ahead of him he began
elevating himself into the cab of his engine

forced to obey

  the muzzle of a gun was shoved so close
to his face that he glanced along the mur-
derous barrels until his eyes met the steel-
blue orbs of the tall train robber who
backed away and permitted him to climb
into the cab covered by the gun the pilot
assumed his accustomed seat

   cut the engine and baggage-car loose
ordered the tall man and his companion
climbed from the cab and told hancock to
assist him in uncoupling the train

  singled out again to do the bidding of the
robbers the flagman accompanied his guard
to the point where the baggage-car was
coupled to the first coach he was ordered
to uncouple the cars and began the task
which was no easy one

    stand back and ill fix it said the
bandit after the flagman had tugged at the
valve of the steam-hose for several moments
with the shotgun at his side the bandit
crouched between the cars like a veteran
trainman he succeeded in closing the
valve and disconnecting the hose but the
steam was escaping so badly that he did
not stop to break the other connections

  with a half-audible statement that they
would just pull em apart the bandit
unhooked one safety chain raised the
coupling-lever and told hancock to signal
the engineer to pull ahead

escaping on the engine

  there was a rending of hose between the
baggage-car and coach as the front part of
the train glided ahead a few feet severed
from the dynamo-car the coaches were
pitched into darkness leaving hancock
with middleton the short bandit climbed
aboard the engine and again rowse was
ordered to pull ahead

  the locomotive was wheeled to the reese
switch which was opened by fireman mc-
lean at the command of the outlaws the
engine was backed upon the siding run
eastward past the coaches and again shifted
to the main track


the railroad mans magazine

  it was easy to divine the intention of the
bandits it was no part of their plan to
mount horses held in waiting and gallop
off to some mountain fastness they were
not train robbers of the old-school but of
the modem type and they desired to have
the engine carry them back to the outskirts
of ogden once in the city they knew they
would be safer from capture than were they
hidden in the very heart of the wasatch
mountains

  every detail of the hold-up to this point
seemed to have worked as the bandits plan-
ned but fate which had favored them in
every move at this juncture turned for the
moment against them

  in their planning they had not reckoned
that the overland would be followed by a
meat train and now as the stolen engine
rolled toward ogden the headlight of the
second locomotive loomed in their path like
a nemesis the freight had stopped at the
semaphore and the front brakeman had
already advanced ahead of the engine and
was walking toward reese

  engineer rowse brought his engine to a
standstill within a short distance of the
freight locomotive the walking flagman
paused by the side of the bandit train and
held his lantern high

  the light enabled him to see that a shot-
gun was pointed at his head and when the
holder of the weapon told him to back to
the fence and hold up his hands he fol-
lowed instructions without argument

  the outlaws climbed from the cab and
passing the freight-engine unnoticed walked
along the track toward the caboose the
short bandit entered the way-car and cov-
ered the lone brakeman with his menacing
shotgun

  then momentarily turning his back on

horse-power

the public demand for all the luxuries of the
modem hotel in travel together with a de-
sire for speed has put a tremendous tax on the
twentieth-centurv locomotive xot only must the
heavy train of steel cars be kept in motion at a
high speed but it must be heated lighted venti-
lated and braked as well all of these are im-
portant considerations as they cause a constant
drain on the locomotive boiler the steam con-
sumption of auxiliaries is so great that locomotive
designers have been forced to consider it in
selecting power for limited trains it happens
that the drain on the boiler from auxiliaries is
greatest in winter the time when the train re-

the man the outlaw tore a portable tele-
phone from the wall of the car and broke
it upon the floor satisfied that this move
would allow more time for escape the
bandit swung himself from -the steps of the
caboose and joining his companion disap-
peared into the night

     an hour later the sheriffs office at ogden
  received a telephone message from james
  wayment a- bishop of the mormon church
  at warren that his two daughters with
  flieir escorts while walking home from a
  country dance had been held up by two
  masked men and relieved of what few valu-
  ables they carried with them this robbery
  occurred about seven miles from ogden and
  about two miles from the point where the
  train robbers abandoned the engine

    almost simultaneous with this report
  came the- information of the train robbery
  the message reaching ogden from promon-
  tory point fifteen miles west of the scene of
  the hold-up engineer rowse had returned
  with his engine to his abandoned train and
  recoupling to the coaches had pulled west-
  ward to the nearest telegraph station

    the usual western plan which prevails
  in crimes of this character was followed in
  this instance except that the sheriffs
  posse all heavily armed rode in automo-
  biles instead of on horseback in scouring
  the country for traces of the train robbers
  within a few hours after the first report of
  the hold-up detectives from three railroads
  of the harriman system were arriving in
  ogden by dozens

    a special train brought a number of rail-
  road officials and more detectives from salt
  lake city for days ogden and surround-
  ing country fairly bristled with officers and
  detectives but the identity of the men still
  remains a profound mystery

for luxuries

  sistance and radiation from the boiler amounts to
  the most in winter the horse-power consumed by
  auxiliaries is about  for a ten-car train which
  may be divided as follows  horse-power for
  operating the two j-inch air pumps  horse-
  power for operating turbo-generators for train
  lighting and  horse-power for heating and
  ventilating the total of  horse-power calls
  for the combustion of about  pounds of coal
  per hour it is common for pacific type power in
  this service to consume  pounds of coal an
  hour hence we may say that about is per cent
  of the coal consumed is used for auxiliaries -

  our mules had been in the corral for sev-
eral days eating uncle sams grain and
hay and were unusually frisky when we
started the light pistol-like snap of the
black snakes mingled musically with our
shrill voices and the rattle of the wagons
a squad of soldiers under command of
sergeant mccoy of the fifteenth infantry
was sent along to act as escort sergeant
mccoy and tom davis the wagon-master
rode ahead mccoy was mounted on a big
brown horse but davis rode a little black
mule named ned which played a prom-
inent part in the little drama i am about
to relate

  we hit the dusty pike for several hours
until we came to a steep bluff bordering a
ravine filled with fine cotton-wood trees
it was easy enough to get the empty wagons
down the bluffs but when loaded it was
impossible to return to the roadway back of
the fort without following the course of a
sandy creek for four or five miles

  while the wood was bein gathered one
man was posted on the bluffs to signal the
camp if indians approached at one oclock
we all gathered round the mess-chest for our
luncheon of bread and cold buffalo meat

  the man on picket duty was called in for
his luncheon he said that shortly before
he had seen mounted men riding to the
south and east of us we tried to laugh
him out of it but he seemed positive claim-

ing that he saw ten or fifteen in all riding
in the same direction and strung out one
behind the other

  as this picket was a raw recruit and had
-never seen an indian the other men were
inclined to doubt him i took particular
interest in his observations however for he
described the indian style of riding so well
that i believed him

   while in the midst of his description we
saw the picket who had been sent to relieve
him waving his musket from the bluff
about half a mile away i was ordered to
go to him and learn the trouble mounting
the wagon-masters little mule ned i
started for the bluff

  while riding up the steep incline from
the ravine i thought i heard firing so i
put the spur to little ned and sent him
to the top at full speed as i came out on
the bluff the picket was dashing toward
me on foot the report of firearms was
now plainly heard and the dust caused by
bullets was flying up near the fleeing mans
feet he had deserted his mount

  while i stood watching i saw the man
fall he was up again and running but
fell again only to climb to his feet this
time he limped along very slowly

   i started for him but a bullet plowed up
the ground directly in front of me who-
ever was doing the shooting was under
cover so i looked in the direction from
which the shot had come and saw a head
duck down behind a shelf of stone

  all over the prairie in the vicinity of
fort wallace there were ridges of soft sand-
stone over to mv right there was a long
ridge of it and i judged that the attacking
party was behind this ridge and that they
were approaching the wagon camp from
that direction


the railroad mans magazine

  the poor fellow ahead of me was now
lying quite still i kept a close watch to
see if he stirred it struck me that he did
move so i made for him to take him to
camp thinking he might only be wounded

  when ten yards farther in his direction
i encountered a storm of bullets my left
leg was struck four inches below the knee
i knew it would be the height of folly to
attempt to warn the camp i dismounted
and leading my mule tried to get into the
ravine

  on arriving at the edge of the long bluff
that led down to the cotton-wood camp my
last hope of getting back to my comrades
left me on both sides of the ravine were
the red devils they were not in great
numbers but they were sufficient to stop
my retreat

  i made a dash for the table-land the
indians did not seem to be worrying about
me so i took the way leading toward fort
wallace and prepared to run the gantlet
as best i could i rode clear around the
stony ridge keeping as far out as possible
and lying down on the side of my mule

  i came in sight of the outlet through
which i must dash if i intended turning
directly toward the fort if i failed i
would be run out on the open prairie where
the race between the indian pony and my
fat little mule would end in only one way

  i started down the stony side of the bluff
at a good stiff gallop the thin slates of the
loose stones clattering and rattling under
my mules feet the mule is one of the
most sure-footed animals at one time my
little mule made a jump that must have
been fifteen feet out and downward i
expected that we would both land with
broken necks but we were still going over
the ground at good speed

  mules do not like indians and ned had
an interest in this affair as we began to
ascend the bluff on the other side ten in-
dian horsemen confronted us and opened
fire their aim was poor for i was not
struck i did not return their fire just
then having left camp with only my two
six-shooters i had not taken a gun with
me which was a great mistake but i did
not suppose for a moment that i would go
further than to ascertain the truth of the
pickets story and then report back to camp

  when i saw the indians in front of me
i turned to the left and throwing myself
along the left side of my mule rode toward
the wagons in that position

  i had a good line on the indians and
let them understand that i had shooting-
irons by letting three broadsides into them

  i must have hit some for one stopped
and others gathered around him i now
turned my mule and rode back up the
sandy bottom for the red-skins were plenty
in my front as well as on both my flanks
 hey had only to throw a line across my
front and i would be hemmed in like a
buffalo

  turning neds head i galloped up the
ravine about a quarter of a mile ahead
of me was a little gulley that seemed to
lead to the level plain beyond i rode into
it and kept looking to the right and left
hoping almost against hope to be able to
get to the level prairie with a fair start for
the fort

  i had not gone far when a shower of
bullets came from all sides poor little
ned and i went down together my mule
was dead

  i did not feel hurt but one of my legs
was penned under the side of the mule so
i opened fire with my right-hand six-
shooter i was soon knocked out however
and for a time lost all interest in the fight

  when i next began to take notice of my
surroundings i lay on an old dirty piece
of a blanket it was dark and a drizzling
rain was falling i tried to make out where
i was i soon began to make out objects
more plainly and noticed a number of
 feather-heads  near me

  i did not move or speak but lay perfectly
still i found i was not tied then i tried
to learn if i was badly hurt the leg that
was hit was a little sore but there were no
bones broken further investigation proved
that the ankle of my other leg was badly
sprained

  i sat up with my arms and head on my
knees and began to think i tried to make
out where i was and how to get away i
could not hope to move unless i could get
on the back of a horse

  i was in a bad fix one i had always
dreaded even more than death a prisoner
in the hands of the indians oh for a
six-shooter five shots would have sent
five of these red devils to the eternal fires-
and the last bullet for myself

  at the first streak of day i tried to look
about me if a pony or any other animal
that i could ride had been within my reach
i would certainly have made a break for
liberty
captured by cheyennes



  as i was straining my eyes trying to sur-
vey the camp i was so startled that i
nearly shouted with joy i heard a voice-
not a cultivated or refined voice-but one
that was touched with the north of ireland
brogue

  the voice was singularly familiar sit-
ting near a big bundle of buffalo robes was
the speaker if it had not been for his
fiery red hair and his short turned-up nose
he might have been taken for one of the
savages for lie was dressed like the rest of
them

  he did not look in my direction but i
knew from his first words that he was talk-
ing at me or rather singing at me the
tune was one i had often heard under more
favorable circumstances it was  the
pretty maid milking her cow but his
words ran like this

        now dont let on you know me

       but i know you-ahem 

        for you are mr bobby west
        of old troop m

  i looked at him and perhaps i smiled
anyhow he went  singing making up
the most remarkable verses so the indians
would not understand that he was giving
me instructions just what to do first he
told me what to do-to make out that i
was very sick and could not stand or walk
that he could not help me now but would
as soon as he had a chance then he went
on singing i recall these words

        i hope god put it in your mind
        to bring along your mouth-organ
        these devils like that kind of music
        so play it all you can

       who-who-too-too-too-de-

         youre with  standing otters band
         dont look behind you

        no matter what you hear or see-

       hum-hum-te-dee te-dum

         if you try to speak to me

         they will kill us both

  all this was sung in a kind of a chant
with frequent pauses while the singer was
working on a pair of moccasins of green buf-
falo hide it was the sweetest song mortal
man ever heard there are marvelous sing-
ers in the world but i am sure none of them
will ever get the applause that i secretly
gave that morning to stubby little red-
headed peter farrell-the last man  earth
i expected to meet just then

  i had known peter farrell as a soldier
at fort sedgwick a few years back be-

cause he could not go through the manual
of arms he was discharged from the ser-
vice how he got among the indians i
was yet to learn

  and yet i did not believe that he could
do much for me i had shot at the indians
and no doubt killed one i was pretty
sure that peter had not it was more prob-
able that a year or two before he had wan-
dered into their camp little knowing or
caring where he was going

  suddenly my surmises fell to the ground
i remembered that unless it is in self-
defense an indian will not attack or injure
a red-headed man if they are obliged to
kill one they- will not scalp him they
kept their hands out of red hair just as if
it were red hot

  well as the dawn broke i saw that there
were not more than three hundred indians
all told

  so standing otter had me and he was
as bloody a woman-killing fiend as there
was on the plains i knew i had nothing
to hope from his soul of black ink

  only a few moments were lost in getting
breakfast which consisted of  bread and
meat the bread was jerked buffalo
meat the  meat was the fat or tallow of
the same animal

  then the camp began to move we trav-
eled i should say about six miles an hour
i rode in an indian wagon this vehicle
is made by fastening a long pole to each
side of the pony the ends dragging on the
ground and swinging a stiff untanned buf-
falo hide between the poles in such a
fashion that it makes a bed something like
a hammock

  they placed me on this and tied my feet
in such a way that i could not slip out
my bad leg did not get accustomed to the
jolting of the pole ends over the ground
and my suffering was intense in a short
time the torture was so great that at inter-
vals i lost all sense of my misery and must
have been unconscious

  the fever in my leg got so bad that i
was afraid inflammation had set in i
looked for death from blood poisoning if
i could have got hold of a weapon i would
have made such a fight that the indians
would have killed me

  we had not gone far before i began to
suffer for water and kept calling for it in
the-hope that farrell would find a way to
help me my head began to ache and with
every jolt it seemed as if my brain would


the railroad maxs magazine

burst every inch of my body was afire
the pain i suffered is beyond my power
to tell

  about two hours later a bladder of water
was thrust into my hands but even then
it was difficult to manage it so as to drink
the warm filthy stuff still it was wet and
as soon as i could master the bladder i let
nearly all the water run down my throat

  when we stopped for the night and the
persistent jolting ended i slept for a few
hours it was still twilight when i awoke
peter farrell sang to me again i tried to
get a conversation with him but he would
not allow it singing to me that if we were
discovered exchanging confidences his life
as well as mine would pay the bill

  with my leg swelled to four times its
usual size and the almost certain prospect
of death before me the warning had very
little meaning-only so far as not to com-
promise peter who no doubt in his own
way was doing all he could to help me

  i also learned from peters singing that
if nothing happened to stop us the indians
would be at the big village by noon the
next day

  this was good and bad news good
that i would not have to be dragged any
farther bad that i was probably being
taken to the indian village to make sport
for the squaws and papooses while i was
being transferred to the happy hunting
grounds

  remembering what peter had chanted

about my mouth organ i got mine out and

struck up a lively tune

  this so pleased the indians that i had
some faint hopes that they would not roast
me just yet at least as long as my little
tin harmonica amused them

  for some reason or other peter became
so timid that he sang me very little-in
fact no information whatsoever about the
village where it was or the number of
indians living there at night when all
was still i tried to wriggle over to a pony
that stood in a dejected attitude near by
but it was no use i found that i had
to crawl over sleeping redskins to get near
him so after a few feeble efforts i lay
still and waited the coming of another day

  i was overjoyed to find myself on the
back of a pony when we started early next
morning

  now i said here goes for a break
they will never take me to their village
alive

  calmly but intently i studied the situa-
tion i was hemmed in by half a hundred
mounted indians i kept pretty quiet and
we jogged along i did not see or hear
peter all that day this made me feel
very blue especially about the middle of
the afternoon when we began to meet the
runners from the indian village

  some were mounted on fleet little colts
while many of the squaws were on foot
with heavy loads of fresh-killed meat on
their backs

  it seemed strange to me then that none
of the bucks of our party offered to carry
the bundles for them-but this is not the
indian way of doing things the men
rode easily along on horseback with their
wives mothers sisters and daughters
trudging wearily under their packs by their
horses sides

  there were now several dozen young
boys running alongside my pony they
talked to me all the time but i knew
nothing of what they said however i
replied to them in the few indian words
i had picked up

  my- conversation must have been very
funny for they laughed a great deal and
for a people who laugh so very seldom i
took it as a great compliment

  i made signs to one for water and im-
agine my surprise when he ran some dis-
tance away and waited for me to ride up
when i did he gave me a drink of very
fair water

  i took this as a good omen at that
time i was not quite eighteen years of age
and i had a faint hope that the young
indian boys had boylike taken a fancy
to me

  we were soon in the middle of the vil-
lage the returning heroes were warmly
welcomed by wives and sweethearts and
there was mourning for the hero who would
never return whether i was guilty of being
the cause of the lamentations i did not
know and had no way of finding out for
peter farrell had disappeared

  that night he turned up again i learned
from his chanting that this party had been
out nearly three weeks had been beyond
smoky hill and had run onto our wood-
train by accident peter had so much to
sing that he was soon out of voice putting
my trust in god i went to sleep

  i had lost no opportunity to bathe my
lame ankle and the bullet-hole thus re-
ducing the swelling in both and causing
captured by cheyennes



them to heal rapidly although my stom-
ach rebelled against the stuff the indians
called food i tried to eat to maintain
strength for the first chance to get away
or get killed

  i had given up all hope of help from
peter when i made any indication for
his assistance in escaping he seemed scared
to death and repeated that if i did get
away they would be so mad they would
kill him to square matters i wondered
how he could be so contented with those
filthy people from time to time as he
sung to me i learned that he had been
picked up by the indians while tramping
along the old abandoned north platte
road and as he had no arms and did not
try to hide they took him along he soon
went to work with a few shoemakers tools
he had with him and made the chief a
kind of a half moccasin and half shoe out
of green-tanned buffalo-hide and this es-
tablished him as shoemaker for the tribe
he could talk quite a little of their gib-
berish and he seemed to like them

  for my part although not wanting to
make matters any worse i had to draw
the line on poodle soup when it came
to sitting around a big pot of dog stew
and plunge and struggle for such titbits
as the short little legs and stumpy tail to
pick as is done at weddings i had to
quit

  the indian has but one good trait-
bravery he is game to the backbone a
fighter to the core for all danger and
pain and even death itself he has a con-
tempt that amounts to indifference the
expression indian bravery has become
the measuring stick by which we size up
all other kinds of courage

  yes i waited patiently to make my es-
cape i pretended all the time that i was
sick and could not walk otherwise my
red friends would have used me for a bon-
fire as it was they did not even tie me
from what petter caroled to me one day
i found out that one reason why i had
not been disposed of sooner was that this
village was supposed to be at peace and
that the government agent would soon
call and distribute blankets for the cold
weather

  all day long however i kept giving
them good lively tunes  money musk
marching through georgia the red
white and blue and a life on the
ocean wave the music also helped to

keep up my own spirits but when the sun
went down and the squaws lit the fires there
were the sounds of deviltry by night

  i hen the fiends began their dance now
slowly then leaping faster and faster
shrieking and writhing as they circled the
crackling flames-and i often expected
that the rising sun would illumine naught
of me but my ashes

  i kept cool however and was always
planning and watching oh if peter
farrell could only disappear for a day and
get word to the fort if into that wild
weird indian swinging chant and the thump
thump of the tom-toms should burst the
crackling music of the spencers

  i managed to play the cripple pretty-
well and had not as yet let them see me
on my feet my wounds were healing and
i was getting stronger

  on the fourth day after arriving at the
village my opportunity came

  a duel to the death was to be fought by
two young warriors stripped perfectly
naked they rode out to the end of the
camp and the whole tribe was present to
see the fight

  my two guards were no exception and
though they kept a good close watch on
my movements they were attracted by the
fight

  i began to squirm around as if eager
to see the sport but all the time shaping
my course toward a good-looking american
horse with  u s branded on his hip

  i had spotted this animal at the very
first and resolved that i would get him if
i could when my turn did come

  not more than ten yards from the horse
was a rawhide bridle now ten yards is
not much of a distance but in my case
yards were miles and minutes hours

  two or three times my body-guards
glanced over at me but at each glance my
whole attention was directed to the two
fighters their mode of dueling was some-
thing like don quixotes encounter with
the knight of the mirrors they rode in
a half circle one to the right the other
to the left and when drawing near each
other their ponies were put to a good run
and as they passed each tried to drive his
spear through the other

  it took a long time to draw blood for
they were splendid horsemen and would
drop on the opposite side of their pony
when nearing each other

  it was on the third round that one




the railroad mans magazine

managed to rip a gash on the shoulder
exposed by the other at each dash the
fighters shortened the distance i judged
that if one did not kill or disable the other
soon they would slide from their ponies
and settle it hand to hand

  as things became more warm the in-
terest of the spectators become more rapt
and my guards were now paying strict at-
tention to the two gladiators

  i waited for the propitious moment it
came sooner than i expected the wound-
ed warrior jumped from his pony and
made a mad rush at his adversary jabbing
his spear into the rival ponys side

   as i expected the whole village tried to
be where they could see the finish i
looked and did not see my guards any-
where-they were lost in the rush

  this was my time i hobbled for that
rope-bridle and slipped it on the big u
s horse but just as i was climbing onto
him my leg was grabbed and i was pulled
back to the ground

  i turned and saw an old buck half
blind and supposed to be crazy he did
not seem to lie angry but made signs and
tried to say something

  i said  how  to him for good-by and
again tried to mount but this time he
grabbed my arm and gave me a powerful
jerk that swung me around in such a way
as to place him between the horse and me

  then i threw all sentiment to the winds
and went at him with the only weapons i
had my feet and fists

  he did not yell or fight back but kept
grabbing at me when i would fry to mount
getting a good opening i butted him in
the stomach this doubled him up and
made him grunt but on turning to the
horse i got a sharp crack on the top of
the head from a little club which he quick-
ly picked up

  i went at him again and butted him in
the stomach with my head following this
up with blows and kicks the club com-
ing in contact with my hand i pulled it
away from him and struck him two or
three times on the head

  he fell to the ground i did not wait
to see whether i had killed him or not i
mounted the horse and lost no time in put-
ting him to a gallop toward hat i had
taken all along to be a river of some kind

  i thought it must be the arkansas i
made straight in its direction

  i did not look behind but kept urging

my horse to his greatest speed at first i
was afraid i had picked the wrong animal
for i had all i could do to get him out
of a trot however he proved to be only
in need of urging

  as soon as he struck a gallop i turned
on his back and looked behind i saw a
great commotion among the indians some
were running after me on foot and others
were mounted i knew that my success or
failure depended entirely on the speed and
endurance of my horse he was going
splendidly now that  u s on him was
beginning to tell

  the bridle - rein had a long whiplike
end and this i used to keep him up to
his work until he lengthened out into
springs that made the prairie flow back
under us like a river

  the indians were now in full chase
after me they had spread out like a
fan making it necessary for me to take
a straight course ahead i was overjoyed
to find that my horse was no mere sprinter
but was keeping up a good rate of speed
that there was none of the wabbling un-
certain motion of a broken down winded
plug

  i kept my face toward the line of bluffs
in front expecting they must skirt a river
when i next took a survey behind me i
saw-that eight of my pursuers were away
ahead of the others and that one of the
eight was leading the whole tribe he
then was the one with whom i must first
deal

  how i wished for a henry rifle or even
a long tom i had nothing in the shape
of arms so it all depended on the bound-
ing animal beneath me he was holding
his own if he could keep going until
dark i would have a show to dodge thg-
outfit behind me

  on i went straight ahead i thought
i must be close to the bluffs but distance
on the plains is very deceptive and they
seemed as far away as ever	-

  the indian leading was now not more
than five hundred yards behind i saw
that he was slowly gaining on me

  i had no doubt but that the little in-
dian pony would do as he had always done
-run down the big horse in a long chase
besides the indian has a secret of twisting
speed out of a horse that a white man
doesnt possess there was a saying on
the plains that  a white man will ride a
horse till he drops and then an indian
captured by cheyennes



will mount him and ride him twice as
far

  in selecting the big horse i knew this
i would not trust a pony to take me out
of the village some may laugh at this
but when they see as many tricks per-
formed by those knowing little rascals as
i have they will not laugh besides 
felt a companionship for the american
horse with the big  u s on him

  when the nearest indian got to within
two or three hundred yards of me i ex-
pected to feel the wind of a bullet but
for some reason he bent forward flat on
his horse and rode in silence the others
were so far behind that i did not fear
them for it was getting late and darkness
would soon be with us

  i was riding toward what looked like
a big rock but it turned out to be a
cone - shaped mound of dirt my horse
when he brought his forefeet down was
now making that heavy flop that is the
forerunner of total collapse in the tired-
out horse i well knew that pound him as i
might he would soon slow down to a dog-
trot or tumble-but i had already planned
what to do when flight was no longer pos-
sible

  i glanced back at the naked savage the
shadows behind me were growing longer
but it was not yet dark i could see only
this lone indian i could hear his ponys
short hard breathing

  he did not shoot i lay on the srde of
my horse but he should have been able to
fetch me with an arrow at that distance-
not more than seventy yards the knoll
was just ahead and my hopes were high
but in one leg i had a bullet-hole and on
the other a sprained ankle and my horse
was beginning to stagger

  lashing him once more into a wavering
gallop and keeping a good grip on his
mane i slipped from his back and on my
lame legs ran by his side be it known
that a good man on foot can easily outrun
a tired horse-even if it is ridden by an
indian

  the pain was frightful not so much
from the wound as from the sprained ankle
the horse kept me from falling i held on
to his mane until my foot became numb
and would bear my full weight

  we were now about fifty yards apart
and behind me i could hear the indian
quirting every possible inch of speed out
of his gasping pony i looked back let go

the horses mane and ran with all my speed
for the top of the hill

  on gaining it i looked back and saw my
horse eating grass while the indian who
had reached the foot of the hill had not
tried to follow me but was riding around
the base of the hill to head me off

  his pony was about as winded as my
horse and as the red gentleman seemed to
be unarmed i was not much afraid of him
so as he went on around the hill i doubled
on him and ran back to my horse out of
sight on the other side of the hill the indian
sent forth shrill war-whoops to guide his
companions

  they would soon be here i snatched
the horses bridle over his head and started
to run along and lead him but he proved
balky so i left him and struck out on foot
down between the steep banks of a small
dry water-course

  that bloodhound had not seen me and i
bore off in an entirely new direction it
wasnow growing dark i kept on through
the winding gulleys never going to the top
of the ridges if i could help it for an ob-
ject moving along the sky-line can be seen
far away-even at night

  i knew that i had little or nothing to
fear from the indian his finding me
would be a mere chance in the darkness
he could not follow my trail and besides
i was able to make almost as good time as
he could

  though my wounds hurt i had to keep
moving if i rested my leg would get so
stiff and sore that i would not be able to
walk

  all night i went on two or three times
i thought i saw a mounted man i stopped
still a moment but must have been mistaken
-for it was never so dark but i could have
seen any large object moving on top of the
hills

  it was now gray in the east and i had
not yet come to the arkansas i expected
at every turn to see the valley where the
river was and it was nearly daybreak when
i found myself plunging through the tall
dry grass which in the plains is a never-
failing sign of water

  daylight found me still in this grass-at
times as high as my head-but i could find
no water

  i	was so utterly tired out and my leg
pained me so badly that i lay down and
went to sleep about noon the burning sun
awoke me observing nothing to hide from
	the railroad mans magazine

	pressed on i was both hungry and dry
the thirst was the worst of the two at
first i made little progress but after a while
i limbered up and kept up a good three-
mile-an-hour gait for the rest of the day

  still nothing to eat and no water along
toward night the grass began to grow short-
er i must have traveled parallel with the
river or else this was the widest valley i
had ever struck

  soon however i was out where i could
look around me-and i was mighty glad
when i saw a small shanty about half a
mile ahead

  before i reached it i saw the shining
water of a good-sized river

  after drowning my thirst i stuck my
foot in the cool water lay back on the grassy
bank and again fell asleep

  there was a good road along the river
and i felt comparatively safe from my ene-
mies as the indians seldom traveled on the
roads when they attack trains or camps
they always make a sudden dash from the
bluffs which line the river valleys

  at this time the overland stage did not
run on the lower arkansas it crossed the
river at fort lyons and the mail was then
taken from the forts and towns to the
smaller places by military mounted men or
four-mule ambulances

  on coming to the old hut i found it
empty i entered found a bunk and con-
cluded to spend the night there

  i lay down but soon heard a noise i
listened but could not make out what it
was a rustling noise seemed to be all
around me

  i lay still to listen when soon by the
faint light that streamed in from the open
doors and windows i saw a large snake-
the largest i had ever seen-glide across the
dirt floor and under my bunk

  before i could make up my mind what to
do another moved out to the middle of the
floor stopped still then made a dive for the
place under the bunk i made a dash and
was soon marking good time down the road

  the next morning it seemed as if the
sides of my stomach were rubbing together
as i started forth i noticed little camp-
fires at my front i approached them very
carefully finally i made out the canvas
covered wagons of a bull train i need not
attempt to describe my feelings when i rea-
lized that i was near my own kind of people

  i was soon telling my story to a n
mackay the wagon-master of a bull train

loaded with grain and bound for fort rey-
nolds the boys did all they could for my
comfort what a breakfast i did eat the
amount of bacon and flapjacks i stored
away to say nothing of the coffee almost
wrecked the grub-wagon

  mackay invited me to travel with him
until i came to a stage line where i could
get back to fort wallace bull trains trav-
el slowly and it took four days to reach
fort lyons there i reported to general
penrose he listened to my story and de-
cided that i had been captured by a band
of cheyennes which had been sent to silver
creek to await the government agent who
was to send them to a new reservation

  thats the way of it he said you
cant depend on an indian when he is once
out of sight i have no cavalry or i would
send a squad out after them

  the quartermaster at fort lyons fur-
nished me with transportation back to
fort wallace and next day i climbed
aboard the coach

  when the concord lumbered up the dusty
road and rolled into the fort it carried a
pretty happy youngster every one was sur-
prised to see me come back with my hair on

  twenty days after i returned to fort
wallace a newly arrived troop of the sev-
enth cavalry was sent out to hunt up the
indians that had captured me

  i went along i wanted to see standing
otter besides the usual allowance i took
an extra supply of cartridges and one in
particular i marked and made good medi-
cine  over and carried handy in my vest-
pocket for the indian who chased me

  before we started i went to the quarter-
masters clerk bought some lump sugar
and took it along this was for the big
american horse with  u s  on his hip
but i guess that run about finished him

  we-found die camp but all was still and
lonesome i fired my medicine cartridge
at a coyote

  i have wondered often if peter farrell
is alive to-day if he stayed with the in-
dians he is probably a rich squaw man
living on some reservation surrounded by
his interesting family but alive or dead
-good luck to him i shall never forget
his singing when i lay a wounded captive
sick and hopeless waiting to be burned at
the stake his rich irish brogue was sweet-
er than the angels singing god bless red-
headed peter farrell-and that big ameri-
can horse

no -matt white and sam horne of two kentucky freight-houses
indulge in a battle royal because  barko  would
ride in a way-car

body sends a dog away or somebody gets a
dog ive handled a thousand dogs and
nary a cat that ought to tell which of em
people think the most of

  you cant tell me anything either ar-
gued the freight-house man  i know when
a woman gets attached to a cat she thinks
as hiuch of it as she does of one of the
family and she wouldnt think eny more of
eny dog people think so much of cats they
wont trust em to express drivers ive
known em to come all the way from ohio
and git em theirselves ive seen examples
of tender regard for cats that would open
an express drivers eyes	

  maybe you have acquiesced the ex-
press driver with the missourian accent
 but when i see one thousand dogs shipped
in and out and nary a cat i cant help
forming some private opinion of my own
which of the two the human family thinks
the most of

   why a dogs a friend of a man hell
stick to you till they tie the crape on the
door and then follow the hearse to crown
hill a dog will take care of the baby
and be a chum to the boy while the cats
stretched out asleep behind the baseburner

      series began in the july j railroad mans magazine single copies  ccnts

 rr	

                 ou cant tell me urged the
                   express driver  that wom-
                   en think more of cats than
                   they do of dogs a cat
                   aint one two three in the
                   affections of a family com-
                   pared to a dog not on yer life

      a woman will go as far for a cat as she
   will for a dog persisted the freight-house
   man i know ive seen it tested

      how can you tell anything about it
  truckin checkin and deliverin freight
  dananded the express driver when you
  drive an express wagon as long as i have
  youll entertain different views ive been
  pickin up and deliverin express five years
  in this town and ive never handled a cat
  yet think of that never had one boxed
  crated or led by a string to ship out or that
  came in not a single cat y understand

      if people think so all-fired much of
  cats as you say they do how does it come
  no one ever has a cat expressed to him or
  her and no one ever sends a cat out by
  express aint that good evidence they
  cant be much affection or somebody would
   send somebody a cat-or somebody would
  get a cat from somebody every week some-


the railroad mans magazine

   theres something in the wag of a dogs
tail like the human handshake and noth-
ing else in creation has it hes barking
his welcome to you and showing his dumb
affection while the cats inside sneaking up
on the canary cant convince me any one
thinks as much of a cat as they do of a dog
it aint human

  this argument ended as all arguments
between man and man end whether politics
religion or philosophy each had his own
slant to the proposition the freight-house
man because of the woman who came back
from ohio after her cat and the express
driver because he had handled a thousand
dogs and nary a cat

  we base many a robust conclusion on a
slender incident in the blindness of toil
by which we earn our bread there is only
now and then a flicker of light in which
grotesque and ill-defined outlines are im-
pressed on the mind of the worker and from
which he works out his state of mind his
estimates and conclusions

  he retains the primitive instinct of com-
bat so we spend many hours in argu-
ment and wrangle and we touch everything
from the eternity of the soul to the domestic
value of the dog and the cat proving but
little and convincing no one

  well theres one thing sure you
couldnt give me the best dog or the flossiest
cat that ever lived concluded the freight-
house man grasping the truck handles if
you should ever get a dog addressed to me
youd do me a favor to stop at the drug-
store and git a package of pizen then
wed have what they call one of them closed
incidents right away

  he released the truck handles

   i was up at the drug-store the other
day and the clerk was showing me a big
woolly spider in a bottle of alcohol
whats that i asked

    why that came out of a bunch of ba-
nanas said the clerk  its a tarantula
the boss is keeping it its a pet

  the other day old judge holbrooks
family mare ran two miles and only touched
the ground about a dozen times when she
brought up she had only a piece of one tug
hanging to her she had scattered the vari-
ous members of the family at convenient
distances along the roadway the old nag
has been in the family ten years and is a
pet these animal pets is something fierce

  why you cant even pet your own wife
if you do she will cast you up as a soft

mark and relieve you of all your change or
have you scrubbing the back porch doing
the dishes and filling the bottle for the
baby when you pet anything you got a
weakness that will be used against you every
time

  well i wouldnt want any spiders and
a horse is a horse observed the express
driver  but a dogs different from any
other animal there is hes the only living
thing you can abuse and treat mean and
that will come back to you a friend hes
the only living animal that knows you and
picks you out and follows you true

  nix on eny of em for me protested
the freight-house man  and durn a dog

  it is said of a well known but odious per-
sonage who sportively displays a cloven
hoof and two short roguish horns that if
called here satan here satan he
will at once appear so it was in the case of
matt white the freight-house man having
passed a sweeping condemnation of all ani-
mal pets with the final anathema on the
dog he proceeded to break the seal of a
way-car that had just been set out by the
local from the west and placed at the
freight-house platform

  it should be explained in this connection
that every day a way-car from the west was
partly emptied at willowdale after which
it was set out at mosstown which was matt
whites station then from the east there
was a way-car every day with the reverse
operation that is partly unloaded at moss-
town and set out at willowdale

  these are industrial towns ten miles
apart and with the usual keen rivalry for
the worlds attention

  intense loyalty to ones surroundings the
passion for exulting over a superiority the
glory of outdoing and surpassing are ever
strong in the human breast it is particu-
larly marked among office men at various
railroad stations

  the consuming passion of the force at
willowdale was to be ahead of mosstown
ditto the reverse

  it was a matter of keen interest to each
station every month to know how many way-
bills the other station had issued how many
expense bills had been made how much the
tonnage and the total revenue

  this feeling of live interest and rivalry
is not confined to willowdale and moss-
town everywhere be it village town or
city there grows up a rivalry with a par-
ticular near-by station of the same class
observations of a country station-agent



  there is glory and exultation in the
freight office of akron to surpass canton
there is rejoicing in the office of kalamazoo
to learn they have outdone battle creek
the old agent at onward with one saw-
mill and one general store boasts with tri-
umph and some braggadocio that last month
he made eighteen way-bills while his neigh-
bor station mcgrawsville with a grain ele-
vator thrown in only made thirteen

  thus it was with the excoriation of dog
pets on his lips matt white the freight-
house man of mosstown broke the seal of
the way-car that had stopped last at wil-
lowdale and opened the car-door

  he was greeted with a plaintive whine
and a lusty bark then a white dog with a
black spot on his back soiled by the dirt of
the car made a bound for liberty and
jumped up to matt with an effusive demon-
stration of gratitude and friendliness for
his liberation

 git out  yelled matt aiming a kick

the dog dodged retreated a safe distance
then began wiggling himself back with a
tentative caution

matt stooped for a piece of
coal and let fly the missile the
dog tucked tail and light-
ning-streaked to the end
of the platform then he

-noavah lw

he jumped up to matt with an effusive demonstration
ok gratitude

  it is always stimulating to be a little
ahead of some one else all the glory of
the world is like the earths physical foun-
dations-one strata above another

  in the freight office of mosstown there
was but little concern about the weal or wo
of the commonwealth or the question of
dividends for the railroad company the
only motive of inspiration was to be a better
station in rank than willowdale in this
strained relationship the two stations were
neighborly but faultfinding and critical
with one another

stopped rested on his haunches and barked
a few scattering volleys at matt

  matt temporarily suspended hostilities
and turned his attention to the way-car

  thats no way to treat a dog pro-
tested the express driver letting out an en-
couraging call and whistle  when that
dog tried to say  thank you  in his dumb
way you kicked him maybe he was in
there by accident maybe some one was
shipping him here maybe hes a piece of
freight if he is there is one check clerk
that ought to be fired


the railroad mans magazine

if i cant find barko i fear she may lose her mind

  the express driver sat down on a box
and whistled again the dog started back
with circumspection and wariness but as he
drew nearer he almost doubled himself in
manifestation of friendliness and then
crawled in humble submissiveness to the feet
of the express driver

   hallo  exclaimed the driver  hes
tagged hes marked to some one nice
way you have of handling freight shipped
to this station

  the express driver leaned over and took
the tag between his fingers

  well wouldnt this jolt you he ex-
claimed   to matt white freight-house
hustler mosstown kentucky matt white
getting a dog matt white the animal-
hater importing a spotted pup whats
his name matt

  matt hurried out of the car and took a
look at the tag

  they aint any reason why any one
should send me a dog said matt with a
puzzled expression on his face  but all
the same i know where that come from
thats some of sam hornes work hes

            the freight-house man at wil-
lowdale

   hes always doing some
low-down thing that will get
me in bad whenever hes
over anything he dont know
what to do with he sneaks it
into this way-car and lets it
come to mosstown and that
puts it up to me

   ive handed him some
warm ones in the way-car that
runs out at his station if any
one should ask you now
heres about that worthless cur
there hes been hanging
around the freight-house at
willowdale and sam horne
has just passed him along to
me you cant fool your un-
cle mathias that dog goes in
the piano-box at the end of the
freight-house and to-morrow
he goes in the way-car tagged
to sam home

  the dog submitted without
resistance and was duly incar-
cerated

  the next day sam horne at
willowdale opened the way-
car the local had set out at the
house and met the joyous greet-
ings of a white dog with a black spot on his
back he too administered a kick but spy-
ing a tag on the dog he called him back and
read sam horne freight-house sop
willowdale kentucky

   what do you know about that  ex-
claimed horne  some ones marked that
coyote to me come here rastus i dont
know for certain but i think i know where
you come from to-morrow you take a
special journey to mosstown ill feed you
on choice cuts to-day and all i ask of you
in return is to nab matt white by the calf
of the leg when he opens the way-car to-
morrow nab him rastuss

  the dog bristled into a show of bellig-
erency and for his understanding found
himself under a box in the freight-house
awaiting the next days way-car

  matt white opened the way-car at moss-
town and was at once repaid by the cordial
and affectionate greetings of  black spot
 hey cut it out  cried matt sharply
to the piano-box with you you dont
get any farther than ellis island to-mor-
row you are going to be deported
observations of a country station-agent



  matt white was puzzled the dog would
go back to sam horne in the willowdale
way-car next day and there was no question
on that point but he wanted to add some
sharp and sizzling words to the tag and he
could think none that would adequately
carry his bitter emotions

  matt was no wit freight-house truck-
ing doesnt develop the art of apt response
and the withering ome-back he called
the express driver to help him mark a tag
that would be suggestive comprehensive
and commensurate in conveying the dislike
-nay the disgust nay the loathing-of
one mathias white freight-house man of
mosstown for one samuel horne freight-
house man of willowdale

  the express driver favored a verse of
poetry written on the back

  matt was inclined to one rapier-thrust-
a single stiletto stab under the name of
samuel horne

  but pegasus being the winged horse of
poesy and swifter than the dull fancy of a
freight-houfee trucker won out

  the express driver went into the problem

of meter measure and rime to express the
freight-house contumely and jjy the next
day had this on the back of the tag

     when you pass away the preachers say

      dust to dust we here inter

      but alive to-day all we can say

     in truth of you is cur to cur

   cur to cur explained the express
driver  thats the rub of it means dog
to dog you know we send this dog to the
other dog see the point  

  matt could hardly pick it out through
the verbal ambush but stood for it and
black spot was tagged to sam horne
willowdale with over printed con-
spicuously to direct attention to the lyric on
the reverse side

  immediatelyon receipt of  black spot
sam horne directed him to the prison-box

  he read the insinuating verse but failed
to catch the hidden thrust in its full signifi-
cance and only understood that the cur
matt white of mosstown had once more
returned the other cur  black spot to
sam horne of willowdale


the railroad mans magazine

  on the following day  black spot 
cleared again for mosstown bearing a tag
with matt whites address coupled with
the pseudonym  rastus  and the tart quo-
tation two of a kind

  this was short and pointed and its mean-
ing was not befogged by any literary
infusions

  for a week black spot alias  ras-
tus was whipsawed and seesawed and
shuttle-cocked back and forth between the
two towns with resentment and anger aug-
menting day by day in the breasts of matt
white of mosstown and sam horne of
willowdale until written words were no
longer potent to conduct the heat and the
gages showed personal violence pressure

  then the affair took a sudden and unex-
pected turn

  the dog was due from willowdale but
the way-car had not yet arrived at moss-
town when the express driver who had all
along taken a live interest in the exchange
drove up in haste to the freight-house door
and called out with some eagerness to matt
matt come here want to show you
something wheres  black spot 

   hes due from willowdale most any
time now answered matt coming across
to the freight-house door

  the express driver thrust a paper out to
matt and pointed out a paragraph

  read that he exclaimed thats
this mornings leader

  matt read aloud

  twenty-five dollars reward for the safe
  return of my white dog he has a black spot
  on his back and answers to the name of
   barko he strayed or was stolen about ten
  days ago	-

ezra phillips

willowdale kentucky

   thats  black spot   urged the ex-
press driver  he commenced coming from
willowdale about ten days ago nab him
this time matt for keeps its our money
well go half and half on it hope that
freight-house man at willowdale wont light
on that advertisement and beat us to it 

   that mutt cant see anything answered
matt assuringlv he dont get half his
freight out of the car if he cant read the
name of his own town on freight packages
you wouldnt expect him to light onto an
 ad like that would you

  the agent came from the office to inter-
view matt

   look here matt said he  the su-
perintendent complains that you are secret-
ing a dog in the way-car that sets out at
willowdale saturday he ate a basket of
sausages you understand that kind of
work must be cut out if you do that again
you can cash in you will settle for the
sausage when the bill comes in understand
that

   willowdale commenced it urged matt
with a sort of boyish doggedness

  well its up to you to put an end to
it directed the agent returning to the
office

   well deduct for this sausage before we
divide the reward said matt to the express
driver

  the local was very late and the eagerly
expected way-car did not come in

  on the afternoon passenger from willow-
dale a slight somewhat bent middle-aged
man got off and made his way over to the
freight-house he did not stop at the office
he cast furtive glances about him but spy-
ing nothing called barko barko a
number of times

  what is it asked matt white

  the man sat down on a box in evident
disappointment

   i am looking for a dog said he  a
white dog with a black spot on his back
hes been missing about ten days i was
informed yesterday that a dog answering
this description had been shipped up here
in a freight-car can you tell me anything
about him do you know where he can
be found 

   i seen in the paper this morning said
matt diplomatically  that a white dog had
been lost and had a black spot on his back
lets see seems to me there was a reward
if i recollect right it was five-no twenty-
five-dollars

  no doubt that was my ad i have
offered that said the man slowly for his
safe return i will explain it we had a
little boy at our house-little jimmie he
was a cripple he could not run and romp
with other boys when he was three years
old we bought him a pup a little affection-
ate fellow and he stayed and played with
jimmie and never deserted him a minute

  no child ever had a more constant
devotion for an animal pet than jimmie had
for that dog he filled the long dull hours
with frolics

   at last jimmie could play no more he
lay in bed for weeks drawn and shriveled
observations of a country station-agent	

and all the time  barko  lay by him every
sound of the little fellows voicebrought an
affectionate greeting from  barko a show
of friendship or a token of devotion jimmie
knew he could not get well and his great
regret was parting from  barko over and
over he made his mother promise to take

but ill take care of him will you wait
here this afternoon you see its this way
hell come in our local freight hes been
riding the way-cars

   i must return on the next train-thats
in a half hour replied the man  but if
you will get him and take care of him and

black spot alias rastus alias barko appeared

care of  barko -to always keep him with
her and let no harm befall him

  maybe you cant understand it jim-
mie died and its a sacred trust with us
mother doesnt sleep day or night if i
cant find  barko i fear she may lose her
mind i am a poor man-

  there was a touch of huskiness in his
voice he took a handkerchief from his
pocket and wiped his eyes

   i am a poor man but i will pay twenty-
five dollars for the dogs return-because we
promised jimmie-

    ill accept the offer said matt missing
the pathetic feature and fixing his mind on
the reward  i dont know just what time
i can find the dog it may be pretty late

 let me know i will come after him early in
 the morning

   this was eagerly agreed to by matt
 the man returned to his home

   a short time before the local arrived
 matt received this message from willow-
 dale

    return dog by baggage-master no  this
 evening owner is here waiting

                           sam horne

 matt white responded briefly

    dog will not be returned will deliver him
 to owner himself

  huh   chuckled matt  that guy has
 just woke up hes never found out until


the railroad mans magazine

after  barko  lifted anchor this afternoon
from his station that there was a reward
then he yelps for him back-quick when
he finds out i it that twenty-five-dollar re-
ward when he had such a good chance at it
hell probably jump on the track in front
of the limited

  it was quite late when the local got in
matt opened the door with extreme caution

   black spot  alias  rastus  alias
 barko  appeared to be within but he was
not in an amiable frame of mind when
the car-door was opened the width of a hand
he snarled and bolted for liberty

  matt grabbed him none too gently and
the supposed  barko  at once shylocked
about a pound of matts calf matt held
on choked him loose and threw him into
the piano-box like he would a rat

  i wont have that ugly whelp around a
minute if he is a pet said matt to the
driver he goes back on no  by ex-
press cod twenty-five dollars

  matt juggled him into a box nailed him
up securely and marked him to  ezra
phillips willowdale and was forthwith
assessed one dollar by the express company
which takes no chances on a dog

  matt rubbed on a little arnica and
chuckled at being able to wind up the dog
incident twenty-five dollars to the good and
in triumphantly putting over such a neat
one on sam horne

  the next day matt was stunned by a
note from mr phillips which read

    the dog you expressed is not  barko
  he was returned to me yesterday evening
  by mr sam horne of the local freight-house
  you should have consulted me as i requested
  and saved this misunderstanding dog is held
  by express company subject to your orders

 matt was dazed sam horne had re-
turned barko to the owner and raked in
the reward and sam horne the low-
lived treacherous wretch on the last ex-
change had rung in a stray and vicious cur
resembling  barko  just to fool the honest
mathias white and had sent the fake tele-
gram to whet matts cupidity

  there was the rattle of the express
drivers wagon and the call of his voice at
the freight-house door

   hey matt heres your dog where do
you want him

   git out  yelled matt furiously  i
dont want him 

  no you dont responded the driver
 hes yourn you shipped him and hes
back to you 

  he dragged the box inside and drove
away the dog let out an ominous growl

  matt white animal hater was the owner
of a pet

by dan duane

author of in the hornets nest

               fate brings together fulward and the per-
               son who seems to be an a accomplice

synopsis of previous chapters

oxenham fulward assistant cashier of the snowball trust company had been robbing
that concern systematically for five years his peculations reached an amount of over one
hundred thousand dollars at the opening of the story he is in sore straits as to how this
money is to be paid back without detection j erasmus low multimillionaire owes his wealth
to the thousand-mile ticket on the back of which had been written a will which gave him the
nucleus of his fortune willed by a man whose life he had formerly saved low prized this thou-
sand-mile ticket above all his other possessions and fulward knowing this decides lo steal it
hoping the reward offered will cover his losses while standing in front of the low home trying to
decide how the theft is to be consummated he is surprised to sec an expensively dressed young girl
coming out of the servants entrance he is attracted to her and follows her up-town but loses her
in the crowd a few nights later upon entering his own rooms he surprises some one ransacking
the apartment and quickly turning up the lights discovers the young girl

chapter v
the charming intruder

lutching wildly at her
 throat her face mirroring every
 phase of grief-stricken horror
 her body trembling and the
 great tears forcing through
 her eyes the young woman
 was the picture of a hunted fawn run to bay

  fulward stood and looked at her he
was so dumfounded that he could not find
words the situation in which he suddenly
found himself-in his own apartment at an
ungodly hour of the morning with a young
girl and a very pretty young girl at that
who seemed intent on robbery - had un-
strung him

  fulward eyed her as she knelt on the
floor with her clenched hands and her tears
coming faster and faster she was so daint-
ily molded her form was so very chic her
face was so dainty and her hands so small-
in fact she seemed so very ladylike that the
man wondered what strange kink in her
brain had driven her to such straits

  she seemed to be trying to speak her lips
quivered painfully but uttered no sound
she wanted to say something to him but
couldnt

  no doubt she is a thief said fulward
to himself-and i am a thief too what
a fortunate meeting she is just the one
person of all the inhabitants of this big city
for whom i am looking thank the fates
for this boon 

  perhaps she noted the friendliness that
his facial changes exhibited for she man-
aged to say in a voice that was broken with
tears and almost incomprehensible

   oh-please sir oh-

  if she said anything else it was lost in
sobs she buried her face in her hands and
cried as if her heart were breaking

  fulward who had stood as resolute as an
oracle stepped across the room when he
was beside the girl he leaned over put his
hand gently on her shoulder and said

   i am not going to hurt you miss get
up sit in that easy chair by the table and
tell me all about it

  he partly lifted her throbbing body from
the floor and tenderly placed her in a chair

began in the april railroad mans magazine single copies i cents

his manner was sufficiently kind to insure
her that his words were honestly uttered-
that instead of calling the police he would
treat her as a guest

  he extinguished some of the lights so
that the glare would not hurt her eyes he
drew the blinds down and placed a chair
quite close to the big one in which she was
huddled like a punished child

  she still sobbed violently fulward knew
sufficient about women not to ask one to
break off her flow of tears too suddenly so
he let the girl sob on while he carefully se-
lected a well-seasoned meerschaum which
he filled with his private mixture then he
sat beside her and blew three or four inha-
lations of the fragrant smoke to the ceiling
before he noticed a cessation in her throb-
bing body

  it wasnt just time to speak he waited
a little longer-and smoked

  up to that moment both of her small
hands had been used to hold to her eyes the
tiny bit of lace and linen that she would
have called a handkerchief one finally
dropped in her lap fulward looked at it
and then he turned and looked at the rather
large jimmy and the hammer with a sawed-
off handle with which she had tried to pry
open the walnut locker in which he kept his
liquors

  they were lying on the floor mute evi-
dence of the fair ones guilt beside them
rested a long bulls-eye lantern-the new-
fangled electric kind not the old-time brown
headlight of song and story

  fulward looked at these - er - bur-
glars tools he didnt much like to give
them so terrible a name for surely the little
thing nestling in the big chair beside him
could not be a burglar

  he looked at them and then he looked at
the small trembling hand of the girl and
wondered at its strength to ply so formida-
ble an instrument of crime

  it couldnt be possible and yet he had
seen her with his own eyes and heard her
with his own ears breaking into his locker
she-the very girl who had left the low
mansion so mysteriously and who had at-
tracted his attention so strangely

  there could be  mistaking those two
very important points in her disfavor

  fulward leaned over and laid his hand
on hers it was an act of friendship he
wanted her to understand that he meant her
 harm but she drew away as if he had
touched her with a red-hot poker

   i wont hurt you said fulward laugh-
ing a pleasant little laugh and tempering
his voice with gentleness  i wont hurt
you perhaps i may be so bold as to say
now that i may prove the very best friend
in all the world come dont carry on
that way dry your eyes and teli me all
about it

  she almost interrupted him

  you wont send for the police you
wont - will you she cried extending
both her hands

  no i shant send for the police re-
plied fulward with the same gentleness and
compassion in his voice  why i couldnt
have the heart to turn a little girl like you
over to the police it would be-it would
be- fulward was at a loss for a word
so he went on  and besides you havent
taken anything that i can see if you had
succeeded in opening that-that wine vault
over there i dont know what you would
have done with its contents

   there is some rare old vintage wine in
there and a pretty good burgundy but i
dont know what a little girl like you would
do with them youd be a funny sight run-
ning down the street with a bottle of cham-
pagne under each arm and the cops chasing
you - at this time of the morning - now
wouldnt you  

  if the girl saw any humor in the picture
she didnt convey it to oxenham fulward

   now he went on  i want you to tell
me all about this-this midnight raid-who
you are and why you should have picked out
my rooms as a place to plunder

  she drew herself closer into the big chair
and looked at him with eyes of wondennent
if he were really friendly as he claimed
she wanted to be quite sure of it so she
studied him most minutely to detect some
little curve in his face and manner that
would prove otherwise

  fulward refilled his pipe and looked at
the girl as if by vibration he could transmit
the thoughts that were uppermost in his
mind much more potently than by spoken
words

  she was looking at him strangely her
eyes seemed to penetrate his mind and body
the tears in them were drying her lips
were set and immobile he wanted her to
speak

  in order that she might have further in-
dication that he wanted her to be entirely at
her ease he arose strolled easily across the
room and removed his coat he reached
the thousand-mile ticket



 into the dresser and took out a comfortable
 smoking-jacket which he donned with ease
 and satisfaction his shoes he also removed
 and laid side by side in their accustomed
 corner and as he slipped his feet into his
 comfortable slippers he glanced over his
 shoulder to detect her observations

   she had watched him as a cat might watch
 a mouse she had followed every little
 movement that he made with the keenest in-
 tensity and when he returned to the chair
 he had placed beside her she was almost
 certain that he was not a detective

   she hadnt quite been able to make up
 her mind on that point at first he seemed
 so very plausible and nice he had talked
 with so much charm that her doubts had
 been aroused but when he slid across the
 room for his house garments she felt pretty
 certain that he would not have taken to
 another mans wearing apparel so deftly if
 he had been a detective still she was not
 sure

   fulward dropped into his chair again
 and again the fragrance of his pipe floated
 over their heads

     come little girl he said  i want you
 to tell me who you are i promise you that
 i mean you no harm as i have already
 told you i may prove the very best friend
 you ever knew cant you trust me  

   the girl looked at him with a most sus-
 picious glance and asked

    are you mr fulward  

     yes replied the banker

    are you sure she went on  are you
 sure that youre not a detective

   a detective oxenham fulward ut-
 tered a convincing hearty laugh  perhaps
 you would like some proof here is my
 card and he opened his pocketbook and
 handed her an engraved calling-card bear-
 ing his name  if that does not suffice
 he went on here is my crest on my ring
 with my initials under it and he thrust his
 left forefinger under her eyes

she took his hand in both of hers and
eyed the crest and the initials beneath
strangely - and fulward was not uncon-
scious of the tender touch and softness of
those little hands

   what a dear little burglar he thought
 the girl did not seem to be greatly im-
 pressed by the ring judging from the man-
 ner in which she eyed it fulward noticed
 this and then he noticed also that she picked
 up his card and looked at it again and
 seemed to want some further proof

  taking a bundle of personal letters from
the inside pocket of his coat he threw them
in her lap-but even a detective might bor-
row another mans calling-cards and letters
in order to hide his identity

   you still disbelieve me  said fulward

    yes-and no the girl replied

  make it no he said i am oxen-
ham fulward if you dont believe it you
may call up the office of this apartment-
house and have them send up a clerk to
identify me owing to the lateness of the
hour i am sure that you would not like
that

  no no cried the girl dont do
that

  well fulward went on having found
a weak spot if you dont believe me i
shall call up a clerk on my own account
and prove it against your wishes perhaps
j-ou wouldnt like that either

  the girl shook her head

  we cant waste time here all night
fulward continued  and i must get you out
of here - before daylight and i dont
propose to let you go until you tell me all
about yourself

  fulward drew his chair closer to hers that
no syllables might be lost in the cross-ex-
amination that he was about to undertake

  here right under his very eyes as if
hurled in his lap by the god luck was the
very person he needed in all the world to be
a party to his crime

chapter vi
getting down to facts

yvtiat is your name was the first
question asked by the banker
minnie she replied almost inaudibly
then in a clearer voice after a pause she
gave it in full minnie payne

  minnie payne repeated fulward
and how old are you my girl

  minnie did not hesitate to reply she
was going on twenty-one she thought but
she wasnt sure

   didnt your father and mother ever tell
you the date of your birth asked ful-
ward

    i aint had no parents replied the girl
fulward saw at a glance one of the hun-
dreds of beautiful girls of the great city of
new york who like minnie payne are
orphans who become the prey of the mas-
ters of the underworld and are taught to


the railroad mans magazine

steal tlieir beauty is their best asset in
nine cases out of ten when one is caught
she usually gets off with a reprimand
through her willing tears she can promise
so smoothly not to do it again

  minnie payne was undoubtedly one of
these girls her absolute disregard for the
english language proved to fulward that
she had grown up without an education
the more she replied to his questions the
more he was convinced that she was hope-
lessly a criminal by instinct but there was
no telling what might have come to her had
she been given a chance to improve her mind

  that she looked younger than the twenty
and one years to which she laid claim ful-
ward was also convinced

    do you do this for a living-this steal-
ing  asked fulward

   yes she answered

    what do you do it for  

  my uncle makes me

  fulward looked aghast

   your uncle  he repeated  you dont
mean to tell me that you deliberately do this
work for a man does he pay you  

   he gives me my home and clothes-
aint that plenty she asked in return

   have you ever been to school   was
fulwards next question

   i went onct said minnie  an when
i gets home i tells my uncle that the teacher
carried her money in her purse an that i
seen it he told me not to come home nex
day without it-an i didnt minnie added
as a sly humor played in her face

   and you didnt go back to school
either said fulward

  you can bet i didnt minnie contin-
ued  uncle an me went an hid

  tell me about this uncle said ful-
ward who is he where is he what
is he

  you sure aint goin to tell no one
asked minnie appealingly

   on my honor little girl fulward re-
plied as he raised his hand to establish an
oath

    all i know minnie said in telling the
story of her life  is that i was taken by
this man some years ago when i was a little
girl he came to the asylum and got me and
took me to his house he told me that he
was my uncle he was very kind and
bought me cake and candy on the way home
when we got to his house and minnie
mentioned a certain number in that part of
new york not far from hells kitchen

there were three other girls there and his
wife and she was very kind co me

  do you live there now asked ful-
ward

   yes replied minnie  in the very
same place

   and this uncle is the man who taught
you how to break into these rooms ques-
tioned the banker with a sweep of his hands

  not uncle exactly minnie continued
but the girls they taught me how to
steal vegetables and meat from the stores in
the neighborhood and then they taught me
how to get away with purses in a crowd
i like that best it is very easy specially
with women when the streets are crowded
and there is a parade or something going
on why i have gone home with ten purses
on an election night and the girls eyes
fairly beamed with satisfaction  and i
would have taken more-only there was no
way to carry them

  umph exclaimed fulward with a
smile you ought to be in wall street
not for mine replied minnie i
never could get anything out of that dis-
trict its women for mine-and nice homes
after dark

    i should gather that you are rather pro-
ficient in your-profession fulward ad-
vanced

  the girl caught the meaning

    yes sh answered  uncle says that i
can beat the rest of the girls put together

   you will pardon me for asking you one
or two rather pointed questions fulward
said

   ask what you like said the girl  i
guess ive told you more now than is good
for me

  dont say that fulward answered re-
assuringly what you have told me has
deeply interested me and it will be of the
greatest help to me in what i am planning
for your future what i want to ask you
particularly is this were you ever appre-
hended  

   do you mean did the cops ever get me
   yes

   once said the girl  i dipped for a
womans purse coming out of a matinee
she was too quick and grabbed my arm i
looked surprised and began to cry and she
held onto me until a cop came up i swore
that she was a liar but the cop took me in
the next morning the judge released me
because the woman didnt show up against
me thats another good reason for tack-
the thousand-mile ticket



ling women they hardly ever come-back at
you men always want to prosecute

  was that the only time asked ful-
ward decidedly

  thats the only time she assured him
unless you hand me over to-night im
pretty careful because that is the only thing
i dread it would kill me to go to jail
behind the girls words was real sin-
cerity something which indicated that she
was not a born criminal somewhere in her
make-up there was a strain of good blood

  now minnie and fulward turned on
the tap of his extremest sweetness  do tell
me why you picked me out as a victim  
uncle told me that you were rich
fulward was filled with glee

  he laughed outright and slowly the rip-
ples faded into a very serious countenance
for a few moments he had nothing to say
he was facing for a brief space of time his
greatest accuser-his own conscience in-
sanely he thought that this girls uncle who-
ever he might or might not be had some
cognizance of his stealings at the bank and
had sent her to find some of the loot-just
as if he kept it hidden in a wine-locker

  then the ludicrous side of the idea
brought him to his senses

   and what did you expect to find in that
locker  he asked

   oh i have found jewelry and money
in queer places she went on  before you
came in i looked around the room and i
didnt find-much i came to the conclu-
sion that there might be something hidden
in that place i started to open it when you
came in

  you didnt find much asked the man
in a quizzical tone

   only these and the girl produced from
a fold in her skirt a diamond scarf-pin and
a pair of cuff-links of heavy gold with a
huge ruby burnishing each center

  she handed them to fulward he took
his property and eyed it as if he had never
seen it before then carelessly threw it on
the table beside him

   minnie he asked further  there are
only a few more things that i want to know
how did you get in here 

  the girl pointed to an open window in
the sleeping-room

   came up the fire-escape eh  

   thats right she answered  and i got
on the fire-escape from the roof of the build-
ing next door and i got onto that roof by
going up in the elevator just before dark

and waiting in the hallway of the top floor
for hours-until i was ready to make my-
play

  ioor little girl said fulward you
dont have it easy do you

  not always she said but i expected
that the trouble of coming here would be
worth while

  it will-believe me fulward assured
her with some emphasis  i want you to
put your trust in me minnie i have a
little scheme to unfold to you later on and
if you will do as i say you wont have to
undertake any of these queer midnight
journeys again

  he held out his hand and she clasped it
and seemed to be much happier than she had
ever been in all her life just why she did
not know it wasnt prompted by a feeling
of reform either

  fulward was not at the end of his quiz-
zing however the one particular bit of
knowledge for which his brain was tingling
he was now to seek if minnie payne an-
swered the next question to his satisfac-
tion he would immediately endeavor to
form a partnership with her-a partnership
which would have as its basis the getting of
the thousand - mile ticket owned by j
erasmus low

  fulward leaned back in his chair picked
up his diamond pin looked at it and threw
it down as if it were valueless he did like-
wise with the ruby cuff-links he crossed his
legs he stuck his thumbs in his armpits
and then he put the question with slow
enunciation that minnie might not lose
any of its import

   i saw you coming out of the low man-
sion on fifth avenue the other night what
were you doing there  

  minnie payne hesitated for a moment
she seemed disinclined to answer a little
blush appeared and disappeared on her
cheeks and then she admitted that she was
a friend of the second butler of the million-
aires establishment and had called that
evening to have a little chat with him
fulward didnt quite care to believe this
he remembered that minnie had left the
place rather peculiarly and that she had
walked from fifth avenue and returned
toward that thoroughfare when she saw a
man ahead of her he brought all of this
to her notice but she quickly waved it aside
as nonsense and proved to fulward that his
own warped mind was responsible for such
suspicions


the railroad mans magazine

   i walked away from fifth avenue be-
cause i was not sure of my direction the
man who approached me did not frighten
me in the least you were standing on the
corner if i had been frightened by him
why wouldnt i have been frightened by
you  

  fulward saw the force of this logic

   i stood on the corner and waited for the
bus didnt i   she asked  and you stood
almost beside me-and stared straight at
me and when you got into the bus the
same time that i did i thought that you only
wanted to flirt but i dont flirt mr ful-
ward whatever my life may be i dont
trifle

   you say that you know the second
butler  

   he is a friend of mine

  a very intimate friend

   he was a boy in the orphan asylum
when i was there i met him several years
ago on broadway and he told me how he
had acquired an english accent and had be-
come a butler he took me to the theater
several times-and i only called on him
that night

  i rather like him minnie confessed
and added that in her dull prosaic life the
little friendship that he held out to her was
one of its few bright spots

  that night she had called on him she
told fulward after he had closely ques-
tioned her because she had not heard from
him for some time and feared that another
woman might have taken her place in his
heart

  it was just a touch of feminine jealousy-
that was all-and it comes to the poor pariah
of the streets just as it comes to the lady
who is blessed with the luxuries of life
and counts her lovers among the men to
whom second butlers are the under-crust of
creation

  no it was only a little satisfaction for
this unfortunate girl to know that her char-
lie had been faithful to her and that his
silence was not caused by his attentions to
another woman she had gone to him as her
duty seemed to dictate she had talked to
him that night only a few minutes because
he was very busy at the time she made an
appointment for the following week and de-
parted and if mr fulward noticed any-
thing peculiar in her actions it was his own
actions that aroused suspicion not hers

  fulward listened to her story and then he
apologized profusely-most profusely

   oh dont  said minnie after find-
ing me here as you did to-night it is only
natural that you should think that my visit
to the low house was not honest

   did you ever think of it as a place to-
to break into fulward was surprised at
the ease with which he said the last three
words

   i know its full of stuff but theres
enough cops hoverin around there to stock
a hen-coop said minnie  oh dont
think that uncle hasnt had it on his list
but hes afraid to tackle the place it has
a bad name among-among-

   say it minnie go ahead dont mind
me fulward spoke with easy assurance

  thieves said minnie and she turned
her head away to tell the truth she didnt
like the word

   did you ever hear of the thousand-mile
ticket asked fulward

  the thousand-mile ticket it was
like introducing the girl to an old friend

  why uncle talks about it night and
day he says that if we could get our hands
on it we would be on easy street the rest
of our lives

   has he ever made an attempt to get it-
or to have you get it 

  no answered the girl we have
talked it over many times but we have al-
ways been afraid to tackle the job

   does your  uncle  know that you are
acquainted with the second butler

  for the first time minnie seemed to show
a spirit of resentment she drew away from
fulward as she remarked

  say what are you asking me that for
what do you want to know so much about
me for  

  minnie said fulward quietly i have
a reason for asking you these questions
you shall know in a very few minutes
only answer this one and then i will take
you into my confidence does your  uncle 
know 

  no the girl replied returning to her
former attitude  i didnt dare tell him
i was afraid that he might want me to use
charlie

chapter vii

the second butler

  ulward emitted a long  m-m-m-m
and resolved himself into a committee
of the whole for a few minutes
the thousand-mile ticket



  although minnie had protected the ple-
beian charlie from the man who held her in
thrall and made her steal for him for her
living there might come a time when min-
nie would be obliged to call charlie into the
fulward service

  at the moment however it was a matter
of secondary importance fulward turned
his thoughts to his own case

  just how to tell the girl why he wanted
her to come into his friendship his confi-
dence and his employ was puzzling him
somewhat

  he thought it best to blurt it out in a
heap then he thought it best to parley with
her and learn just what she would agree to
do then he decided to let the matter rest for
the present and ask minnie to call on him
in the morning when he would unfold his
plans to her

  his thoughts were finally interrupted by
the girl who spoke

  what are you going to do with me
she asked her voice faltering somewhat  i
have told you the truth about myself and
you said that you would be my friend

   i mean to keep my word minnie but it
is difficult for me to get started-to tell you
in the right way i mean when you hear
my story you will be-dumfounded let
me think a few minutes longer

   im very hungry-and thirsty said the
girl

  why didnt you say so before put in
fulward quickly  that part of it is easily
remedied

  he went to the telephone and called the
office in nearly all well - conducted new
york bachelor apartments the kitchen is
kept open all night and fulwards place
boasted its little accommodations of that sort

  lets see what would be nice at this
hour  he said turning to her but minnie
be it known was not a particular being
when it came to food and shook her pretty
head turning to the telephone fulward
gave the order for some oysters on the half-
shell lamb chops with browned potatoes a
salad of hearts of lettuce and an omelet and
coffee

   that order is for two he shouted into
the telephone and hung up the receiver

   i think that will make a very nice sup-
per-for two he said  we can open a
bottle of that rare vintage i caught you pil-
fering to-night if you like

  he patted her head to assure her that he
did not mean to hurt her feelings

   please dont said minnie looking up
at him with the eyes of an injured animal
id give anything in this world to lead an
honest life-and besides i dontdrink

  here was a queer combination indeed
but the girls desire for a better life and the
fact that she was not given to drink did not
soften the heart of the man

  if he had hunted the world over he
thought again he could not have found a
more satisfactory person for the theft that
he was planning it all fitted in so well
everything seemed to shape itself so per-
fectly-and there was charlie the second
butler

  fulward cleared the little center-table of
its paraphernalia and books and turned it
so that it stood squarely between them he
placed his own chair and then went around
to minnie and twisted the great armchair
from which she hadnt moved so that it
faced the table

  then he went to the sofa carried back an
armful of pillows and propped them be-
hind her so that she could eat more com-
fortably as he administered the last pat
to the last pillow he leaned over the girl and
put his arm around her shoulders

  she drew back with a timidity that star-
tled him her natural thought was that he
intended to insult her in some way she
felt like the sparrow that finds itself in the
claws of the cat but fulward was not a
man to trifle with such as minnie payne

  this was a matter of business it was
business for him to be kind to her it was
business for him to assure her of his confi-
dence and it was business for him to show
her that he liked her and wanted to trust her

  the next words that he uttered made her
shudder still more ever since she had been
discovered by fulward minnie wondered
what he intended to do with her the out-
come of the night and the plausibility and
kindness of the man had taken more shapes
in her not too well-developed mind to enable
her to settle on any one as a possibility
fulward had decided on his plan there
was no time like the present

  minnie he said bending still closer
 i am in great trouble and i want you to
help me like voy little girl i am a
thief-

  she drew away from him in horror

  he stood erect and stepped a few feet
from her chair holding his arms wide as
an orator would while making an impas-
sioned peroration he continued


the railroad mans magazine

   what i tell you is true i am no better
than you in fact i am a more pitiable
object for my stealing has been premedi-
tated - it could have been avoided you
were forced to it for you became the tool of
a desperate man who uses you because you
are young and pretty if you had grown
up in better surroundings and had known
a father and mother you would have a dif-
ferent story to tell i am confident on that
point

   minnie he went on as he returned to
the table and took his chair opposite her
lean over i want you to understand me
perfectly

  she moved her body so that she could
place her arms on the table

  you and i are both thieves minnie
we understand each other on that score
she nodded

   do you really know me-do you know
just who i am  

  you are mr oxenham fulward she
replied  you belong to a trust company
 you have heard of me many times
before  

  we have had you spotted for a long
time said the girl

   you thought i was a rich man 

   yes

  the customary idea of the general public
regarding gentlemen connected with trust
companies thought fulward

   well im a poor man - a very poor
man said fulward  i need a great deal
of money and i need it at once-and i am
going to employ you-

  the waiter bearing the supper knocked at
the door

   you can go in that room if you do not
want to see him said fulward pointing
but it is not unusual to give late suppers
here and the waiters know their business
minnie shrugged her shoulders as if it
mattered nothing to her

  come in called fulward

  the waiter entered and with the silent
activity of his kind proceeded to set the sup-
per while he was spreading the snowy
cloth and placing the dishes of food where
they would be in easy reach of fulward not
a word was said the waiter seemed to be
particular in having everything just so as
careful waiters will and fulward became
impatient at his persistent attention when
he finally handed minnie a serviette and
stood at attention the banker sharply said
 ill serve and the waiter retreated

  the supper was hot and inviting and
minnie ate as she had seldom eaten before
fulward noticed how famished she seemed
and spoke of it in a kindly tone

   i havent had anything to eat since yes-
terday said the girl  i caift eat much
when i am on one of these affairs i had to
come here yesterday and look over my
ground and study how to get in and she
went on what is more important how to
get out

  fulward helped her to another chop
what is this great scheme of yours
what do you want me to do-rob a bank 
she asked with a twinkle

  fulward rested his arm on the table and
looked steadfastly at the girl

  minnie he said you eat and i will
talk but listen carefully for i am going
to make you a proposition that will mean
much to you before we go any further i
want your sacred promise that if we should
disagree and you should decline my offer
you will never speak of this visit or what i
shall tell you to any one in return i shall
keep sacred all that i know about you

   i agree said minnie between bites as
she held out her hand fulward shook it
warmly then he proceeded

   minnie i want to get the thousand-
mile ticket in my possession and i want
you to help me

  minnie looked up from her supper as
much as to say thats about the most impos-
sible thing in all the world but she waited
to hear the rest of fulwards proposition

   i am short in my accounts at the com-
panys office i need money and i need it
quickly i am certain that the easiest and
quickest way in which to secure cash is to
get hold of the thousand-mile ticket

  now i want you to help me solve that
part of the problem if you care to work
with me and for me from this moment you
will have everything you may want to keep
you comfortable until i get that document
in my possession when i do i will give
you five thousand dollars in cash-and in
the kind of cash that will be easy to handle

   i want you to meet me here to-morrow
evening and make the final arrangements
we will then go into the details and find
out the best way to operate what princi-
pally interests me at this moment is whether
or not you accept my proposition

   supposing i fail- said minnie with an
eye to business what do i get for my
trouble then  
the thousand-mile ticket



  i will take care of that replied ful-
ward  i wont ask you to work for
nothing

   couldnt you give me some idea 
well say i promise you a thousand
dollars anyhow fulward said but i
would rather not state anything definite just
now we must work for success if we
fail i will see that you do not lose any-
thing

   why do you think i will succeed  
asked minnie

   because you know charlie the second
butler so well

  this was an obstacle over which ful-
ward feared that he and minnie would trip
and he wanted to tackle it early in the game

  oh no-no minnie put both hands
to her face i couldnt i couldnt he
doesnt know that i-that i steal and lies
so honest 

  are you sure asked fulward whose
ideas of honesty were not too solid

   sure of what  minnie asked in return
 that charlie is so very honest wouldnt
he like a few thousand too and a little trip
to europe  

  minnie realized that the banker meant
business that he was prepared to spend all
the money necessary to carry out his plan

   i dont know the girl answered  but
he has been the one person i have looked up
to in all the world i would hate to think
that charlie would go bad too everybody
i meet is either a thief-or-wants to be
and charlie- minnie brushed away a
tear

  well fulward went on we wont
worry about charlie just now there are
a lot of better things in this world than
being the second butler of a millionaire
young men want to get ahead and i guess
that charlie wont pass by the right kind of
an opportunity

  he is not the kind of man you think
he is said minnie sharply

  and you are not the kind of a girl he
thinks you are retorted the banker

  a second later he was sorry that he had

  made that reply it made the girl mistrust
him of that he was sure she looked at
him for the first time during the night as if
she hated him as if he were trying to make
her and the man she loved the tools of his
scheme

  if they failed she would te to blame
and if charlie were dragged into it he
would be jointly to blame with her she
could see it in no other light she was
struggling inwardly with herself she was
not a match for the keen mind of this man
old enough to be her father all she could
do was lead her humble life as a pickpocket
and a sneak and abide by the orders of her
uncle and when the time came and she
could marry charlie-when he earned suffi-
cient money to support them both-then she
would give up the- terrible life into which
fate had so rudely thrust her-and be a
lady

  fulward had made a mistake

  im sorry minnie he said i didnt
mean to say that

   i think i had better go she said
reaching for her things

  no i forbid it said fulward you
must wait and hear me further i cant af-
ford to let you go now we will not speak
of charlie again i will apologize for what

i	said about him i did not know that you
would take it so much to heart

  the girl was gathering up her tools
seemingly unconscious of his presence

  minnie-fulward caught her by the
arm- you must listen to me 

  he turned her around until she faced
him he placed his hands on her shoulders
so that she could not get away from him

   do you know what i am doing for you 
do you realize i want you to help me
do so and i will take care of you always
here i will talk real business to you now

-this very moment

  he pulled a well-filled wallet from his
pocket and opened it so that the bills were
exposed he sat at the table and began
counting them out minnie stood as one
transfixed

montauk arrow the proposed terminus of the atlantic steamship lines and the fast

rail route through new york city

the new atlantic gateway

by john walters

new york harbors claim to the title of  gateway of america  is
being seriously threatened the call for longer wharves for europes
gigantic liners which grow larger every year is not being satisfactorily
met and shipping facilities are fast becoming limited in looking about for
a future docking place however the steamship companies have found what
they believe to be the complete solution of their difficulties it consists of a
well-sheltered bay free from shoals lying at the eastern extremity of long
island within two hours travel of the metropolis and well fitted for handling
the commerce of a great nation it will bring europe six hours closer to
america	

overcrowding of shipping in new york harbor gives promise of rival
port on long island and will shorten mail routes
across the continent

t looks now as if the big eastern
railway and steamship terminal
of the near future will not be
new york city but a place
known as fort pond bay situ-
ated at montauk point long
island the most easterly spot in the state of
new york ever since the pennsylvania
railroad got control of the long island
railroad this project has been the talk of
eastern railroad circles part developments

indicate the realization of this gigantic
scheme the principal builders are the
pennsylvania railroad and the international
mercantile marine company

  the titanic and olympic the new levia-
thans of the white star line may inaugu-
rate the montauk point service before the
end of the year giving the pennsylvania
railroad through its connection with the
long island railroad system control of a
great portion of the transatlantic traffic
the new atlantic gateway



  as a seaport second to no other in the
world the fort fond bay improvement will
involve the expenditure of many millions of
dollars piers great enough to accommodate
railroad trains for passengers and freight
will be projected one thousand feet into the
bay with elaborate stations for the rapid
handling of luggage by the customs in-
spectors

  along the water-front for a mile and a
half the pier system which includes steel
reenforced concrete bulkheads and double
concourses will form the main part of the
terminal from which passengers will be car-
ried without change of cars to the gulf of
mexico or the coast of california

  when austin corbin the consolidator of
the long island railroad lines took the
initial steps for the fort pond bay harbor
improvement the scheme was regarded as a
far-distant possibility but since the hudson
river and new york harbor crowded with
ships of every description has been con-
siderably narrowed by the big docks on the
manhattan and new jersey shores mon-
tauk is left open as the natural gateway to
new york

  ralph peters now president of the long
island railroad who recently closed a deal
with edward c m fitzgerald and robert
c baldwin a brother of the late william

h	baldwin for many years president of
the long island railroad system for the
purchase of the mile and a half water-front
including two hundred and twenty-five acres
of land expects to carry to completion the
corbin idea

  before announcing the purchase of the
harbor at montauk point mr peters spent
several months with the officials of the penn-
sylvania railroad and the international
mercantile marine in forming tentative
plans for the gigantic seaport and the track-
ing of the railroad system to accommodate
the fast electric trains which will be operated
from the pennsylvania terminal to montauk
a distance of one hundred and eighteen miles

to new york in  minutes

  by actual demonstration mr peters and
james a mccrea president of the penn-
sylvania railroad proved that the run from
the fort pond bay station to the manhattan
terminal of the long island railroad can
be made in one hundred and fifty minutes
including a stop at the sunnyside yards in
long island city where an electric motor-

car was substituted for the last part of the
trip under the east river

  in preparation for the fort pond ter-
minal the long island railroad is com-
pleting the big freight terminals at bay
ridge and jamaica which will be connected
with the proposed jamaica bay improve-
ment and the new england connection of
the montauk main line this connection
will include a system of bridges and tunnels
to connect with the mott haven yards in
manhattan the new right-of-way has al-
ready been obtained by the new york con-
necting railroad

  with the montauk main line as the back
of the elaborate system planned by mr
peters and his predecessors the pennsyl-
vania railroad spreading four track-lines
south east and north from its new jersey
yards will control one of the most important
railroad systems in the united states

  on the land side of the main terminal at
montauk five thousand acres of land have
been reserved for the building of a city in
which to house the thousands of employees
who will be required to handle the passenger
traffic when the seaport is completed at
the end of a strip of land where the montauk
point lighthouse stands one thousand five
hundred acres have been reserved for a
summer resort

  although the international mercantile
marine company which controls the white
star line the atlantic transport line the
red star line american line and leland
line is not recorded as having interests at
montauk its close connections with the
pennsylvania railroad brought about the
negotiations which resulted in the announce-
ment that montauk is about to be estab-
lished as a steamship-station

  recently j pierpont morgan hastened to
washington in the interest of the white
star line to make application for the exten-
sion of two of the chelsea piers for the
accommodation of the titanic and olympic
the war department refused the applica-
tion four times but finally granted permis-
sion for the erection of some temporary
piling at the end of the present piers so that
these great ships can make a landing on
their maiden voyages

  the license stipulates however that the
secretary of war may at any time order
the removal of these additions without legal
protest from the white star line

  this leaves still unsettled the question of
future docking facilities in new york bar-


the railroad mans magazine

bor for the big transatlantic liners now
building or which will be built in the fu-
ture and makes the using of fort pond
bay as imperative as ever

  the interests in favor of extending the
steamship piers contend that montauk point
will take from new york its supremacy in
handling transatlantic shipping and that
after passenger service has been inaugurated
to fort pond the freight service will soon
follow leaving the biggest ships entirely out
of the hudson river

in favor of montauk point

  it remains to be seen said an officer
of the international mercantile marine
whether new york will keep up the strides
which are making in steamship advance-
ment boston is offering inducements to
shipping in many ways but montauk will
be the most favorable to new york should
the war department turn down the appli-
cation for longer piers in the hudson river

   the objection to brooklyn as a docking-
place for the leviathan steamships is the
small depth of channel and little available
land in manhattan the steamship com-
panies can only build their piers in the river
as the city will not allow the condemnation
of land for us to dredge inland

  with the decision of the steamship lines
to adopt montauk as the alternative of the
chelsea piers engineers and experts in the
handling of passengers and freight have
been engaged to work on the plans for the
fort pond harbor terminal the secrecy
with which the work is being guarded is
equaled only by the secret methods employed
by the government in preparing fortification
plans

  the engineer who prepared preliminary
plans for the four big piers to extend into
block island sound from the fort pond
beach declared that five million dollars will
have been spent before the first ship lands
at montauk

  from oakdale long island a town sixty
miles west of montauk point the long
island railroad right-of-way will be double-
tracked and later probably four-tracked
amagansett the least-populated town on
long island which is eighteen miles from
the proposed fort pond station will be the
starting-point for the elaborate system of
tracks which will be laid through the cut
now used as a single-track line to montauk
point

  following the present railroad course
along napeague beach the narrow neck of
land between napeague harbor and the
atlantic ocean the system will run through
hitherwoods from the-present woods the
lines of tracks will spread along the water-
front to connect with the gigantic terminal

piers one thousand feet long

  the big ships entering fort pond bay
will pass through the deep-water channel in
block island sound and entering the har-
bor protected by a bulkhead from culloden
point the most easterly point of fort pond
bay will steam alongside the one thousand-
foot piers which according to present plans
will be three hundred feet apart

  where passengers are now compelled to
stand on cold piers while customs men go
through their luggage those landing at fort
pond bay will be at once conveyed to the
examination on a long moving platform
the same means will be used to carry lug-
gage to the concourse where it will be piled
for rapid examination

  on the lower floor of the pier will be the
railroad tracks for the trains which will be
loaded with baggage as rapidly as the cus-
tom-house officials have finished their work
these trains will be run to new york at
intervals of a few minutes so that no time
will be lost after leaving the ship

  an elevated promenade will extend over
the tracks in the railroad yards which when
completed will be the largest in the world
this promenade will lead to the heights
where the promoters of montauk point ex-
pect to build modern hotels

  along fort pond bay a tentative site has
been selected for an electric power-house
to operate the trains and the many devices
which will be installed on the piers for the
quick handling of passengers this power-
house will also furnish electricity for the
town now being planned on the site of
hitherwood hills

will land immigrants

  in connection with the power-house there
will be a special pier in addition to a ter-
minal for coal-cars which will be ferried to
bay ridge brooklyn from greenville and
then run over the long island tracks through
the bay ridge railroad cut connecting be-
yond jamaica with the montauk main line

it is expected that the high land at
the new atlantic gateway



rocky point which is the west end of fort
pond bay will be selected for the immi-
gration stations if the steamship companies
finally decide to land all passengers at
montauk this land borders on the rail-
road yards and by a system of moving
platforms above the tracks the immigrants
can be shifted from the pier to the station
in less than fifteen minutes doing away
with die steamboats which are packed to
the limit by immigrants leaving the big ships
in the hudson river

  after the immigrants have been passed
special trains will carry them to the penn-
sylvania terminal in manhattan or to their
destinations in the west the engineers
now at work on the plans will submit their
ideas to the government experts as soon as it
is decided to establish the station

  it will be possible to select one of the
small islands in napeague bay for a quar-
antine station the boarding-officers can
take charge of the ships at fort pond as
soon as they round montauk point and pass
into the block island sound there the
water is protected from the northwest winds
by the low stretch of gardiners island

  a ferry service from fort pond bay to
new london connecticut and connections
there with die new york new haven and
hartford railroad and the central vermont
railroad will be considered as the means of
transporting passengers to new england and
canada it is estimated that fifteen hours
and many irritating transfers can be saved
by the operation of the ferry-line which
will consist as planned of fast ships capable
of crossing the sound in less than two hours

  foundation experts who have made tests
of the soil at montauk point have found it
suitable for big buildings in most of the

spots there is a solid rock foundation while
in other places there is heavy sand which is
said to be ideal for foundation work on
the ocean s-ide of the land the engineers are
planning to build a sea-wall to skirt the
cliffs which are now gradually being
changed by the action of the water

  the sailing-time of fast ships from a
point opposite montauk to the docks in the
chelsea district is estimated at eight hours
with considerable delays in case of fog
when montauk is used as the landing-
place the time to the pennsylvania rail-
road depot will be cut to two hours

  from montauk to philadelphia will be
four hours run on the proposed all-electric
line making that distance in half the time
it now takes for a ship to reach its pier in
the hudson river to chicago in twenty
hours from the time of leaving the ship will
be a possibility

  in connection with the plans freight-
experts are considering the ultimate adop-
tion of montauk as a freight-station the
steamship companies say that this will not
be done for many years but those who are
working on the plans are considering a loca-
tion in new york for a central freight-
depot in connection with the steamships

   this depot would be an immense build-
ing provided with entrances for the trucks
which now block the steamship-pier en-
trances said one of the freight-experts

   it would mean tubes under the east
river so that no delays would be possible
between new york and montauk freight
designated to the west could be sent through
by way of bay ridge and greenville new
jersey while the proposed new london ter-
minal would take care of the new england
freight-handling

the secret red lights

 by harry bedwell

      bert daily the conductor begins an investigation
      of a queer happening on the lobo division

  part i

t-he engineer of the work-train
was forcing his undersized
djli iii  engine do her best to make
nebi le- was saturday night
and the crew was impatient
to be at lobo the division
headquarters for sunday

  the headlight thrust its wedge of white
into the darkened desert the east was be-
ginning to be faintly tinged by the coming
moon

  it was a light train that the engine
pulled a few empty flat cars a tool - car
and the caboose the workmen sat on the
edge of the flat cars and stared vacantly
into the desert the gang-boss stood stiffly
erect in the middle of one of the cars his
hands behind his back trying to look mas-
terful bert daily the rear brakeman
came out of the caboose and stood on the
platform gazing ahead his lantern swing-
ing idly in his hand

  the train rounded on a curve at the foot
of a line of sand-dunes and the flaming
tail-lights of a freight-train which stopped
on the track ahead of them showed almost
in the engineers face a flagman sprang
from the rear of the freight-train and fran-
tically waved down the work-train

  the firemans  hold em  was tossed
broadcast over the desert as the air-brakes
went on with a roar that convulsed the
train it checked the train so suddenly
that the gang - boss soared upward with
flapping arms then came to earth on the
soft sand alighting on his face

  the workmen were tumbled off the cars
like tenpins bert daily glimpsed the red
lights ahead in time to anticipate the shock

of air-brakes and to study the distance be-
tween his train and the freight with a calm
eye

  were going to hit em hard he judged
reluctantly

  the left-hand tail-light blinked once
and daily knew the head brakeman had
deserted the cab it blinked again and he
guessed the fireman had unloaded

   its time i too was going he said
grimly as the whistle screamed a final pro-
test and the engineer swung clear of his
engine

  daily glanced back as he swung low on
the bottom step for the jump he saw the
conductor spring from the rear platform of
the caboose and bound off at a tangent
and then over a bunch of sage-brush he
fell heavily and shattered his lantern
daily swung lower still and sprang away
easily

  the freight-train began to move ahead
slowly then the work-train struck and
went tearing through the caboose

  bert daily rounded sharply about and
ran to his conductor who was getting pain-
fully to his feet spitting out sand and
vicious oaths with the same breath

   weve torn those fellows up some
daily panted ill go back and flag
you have your work cut out for you

  still running he struck the track and
swept on around the sand-dunes he un-
twisted two torpedoes from his lantern-
frame planted them at the prescribed dis-
tance then walked back some way toward
the wreck and sat down

  he could catch only faint sounds from
the wreck these became fainter as the




the railroad mans magazine

night slipped by and at length ceased al-
together something definite had been
done-help sent for or perhaps the two
crews had settled to the work of getting
under way again

   the chill of the desert night caused daily
to get up and pace about restlessly the
hours dragged out till midnight and into
morning yet no sign came from the other
side of the sand - dunes to proclaim how
affairs were with the two trains

  dailys impatience waxed hot as his body
grew chill this was a deuce of a way to
spend saturday night what were those
fellows over there doing to take up so much
time-and yet make so little noise and
why had there been no trains along to be
stopped two or three were past due from
the east

   so he fretted out the hours till some time
after sunrise when the desert fumed like a
furnace under the hot sun then a train
streaked up over the long horizon shot
toward him struck the torpedoes and
stopped beside him

   work-train tore up the hind end of a
freight around on the other side of those
dunes some time last night daily ex-
plained to the conductor and the engineer
 havent heard anything of them since
dont know if they are still there or not

  you look as if you had spent a pleas-
ant night of it grinned the conductor
 weve been tied up behind a wreck our-
selves

   what have you there   asked daily
nodding gloomily at the two dusty coaches
drawn by the engine he had hoped for
a passenger-train with diner attached

   superintendent hoods car answered
the conductor easily

  a straight slim young man with a face
of great gravity strode from the rear end
of the train

  whats the delay morris he asked
the conductor

  tone and gesture were self-conscious of
his fresh clean clothes and his authority
over these older men daily looked into
the restless eyes with his own direct gaze
and saw the others flinch

  this was ellis sargent mr hoods
chief clerk

  the conductor explained why they had
stopped

    all right said sargent bruskly  run
down to where the accident happened and
bee what has become of the two trains

daily you come back to the car with me
and tell mr hood what has happened

  daily followed sargent back to the pri-
vate car and swung up on the platform as
the train started slowly forward sargent
entered the car daily paused in the door-
way till his eyes used to the glaring hot
light could distinguish objects in the cool
dark car

  oh its daily came mr hoods
quiet voice what has happened now

  daily began to see the interior of the
apartment more clearly mr hood sat
comfortably tilted back in a chair a news-
paper on his knee at the far end two
ladies sat at a small table on which glasses
of cold stuff clinked musically daily sat
his useless lantern down upon the platform

   here sit down ordered mr hood
pushing out a chair with his foot his
quiet eyes had noted that dailys face was
haggard from a sleepless night of watching

  daily slumped wearily into the chair
and explained how he happened to be there
and his eyes kept turning toward the
glasses of cool liquid that clinked so merrily
on the little table between the two young
ladies

  he had neither eaten nor drunk anything
since the afternoon of the day before

   yes he heard sargent murmur to the
young women he has been out all night
flagging

   you dont know if any one was hurt
do you   asked mr hood

  no sir daily shook his head and
the motion caused a row of sweating glasses
to ring themselves about the car

  the train came to a stop and mr hood
and his chief clerk walked out into the sun-
light daily arose stiffly and started to
follow at the doorway a quiet voice
checked him suddenly

  wouldnt you like to have a drink after
your night out

  daily came about slowly one of the
young women was coming toward him with
a glass held out

   if-you-please he counted out the
words slowly to be sure of them

  he put the glass to his lips and drank
deliberately the cool stuff seemed to sat-
urate his being with a divine fire the
grave face of the girl before him became
radiant and glorified it seemed to lure
him kindly out on an azure cloud

  wont you have another the glorified
face asked
the secret

red lights



  daily willed himself to refuse but his
will was broken

   if - you - please he again counted
out soberly

  another glass loomed before him again
he drank and again the grave face of the
girl became glorified and floated above him
in a vague mist he gave up the glass
slowly thanked her with a tearful voice
and walked out into the hot sunlight

  the work - train and the freight - train
were gone leaving behind only the caboose
-a splintered and mangled hulk tipped
disconsolately to one side-the only mark
to show there had been an accident

  daily forgot to be angry because he had
not been called in when the trains had de-
parted

   i wonder what that was she gave me to
drink   he asked the solitude

  the girl was miss glen hood the su-
perintendents daughter

ii

afr hood was holding an investiga-
tion in his office to determine the
cause of the rear-end collision between the
work-train and the freight all those in-
terested and some who were not were gath-
ered to give testimony

   mr hood his chief clerk and the train-
master sat at one side of a big table and
examined witnesses the investigation was
wearisome to all particularly the rear
brakeman of the freight-train for the evi-
dence tended to show that his swiftness in
getting out to flag any train following his
own was not great

   to the rest it was nerve-fretting for cau-
tious train and engine men make poor wit-
nesses

   bert daily was called told the little he
knew then went back to his chair at the
back of the room and the paper he had
been reading

  four days had elapsed since the rear-
end collision and in that time he had been
promoted to the rank and pay of a conduc-
tor he had made two trips and had but a
few minutes before going on the stand been
called to take an extra east at five oclock

  daily raised his head from his paper to
listen to the testimony of the engineer of
the freight-train the engineer said doubt-
fully that a few seconds after rounding the
sand-dunes he had seen a red light swing
across the track and disappear

  i gave her the big hole he concluded
his testimony doggedly  and had her
stopped within her own length thats all
except i guess maybe there really wasnt
any red light there

  daily grew tired of the questioning and
wandered into the outer office there was
no one there business had been suspended
during the investigation daily got him-
self another paper a more comfortable
chair and sat down by a window

  presently miss hood and her friend
miss harnett came in quietly nodded
gravely at daily and sat down daily lost
interest in the paper and stared idly out of
the window

  the investigation broke up and men be-
gan to file through the outer office ellis
sargent came out hurriedly spied the ladies
and daily and came forward with his
quick nervous stride he turned to daily
from greeting the young women

    im going out with you to-night daily
he said wait till i get my hat and coat
and ill go down to the yard office with
you he hurried back into the inner
office

   i hope there were no bad effects from
your night of flagging miss hood said
turning slowly to daily

  the conductor looked at her idly and
the vague speculation began again in his
brain as to what kind of drink she had
given him to make this grave face appear
glorified her remark hardly broke his
chain of thought for the thought of so
many harder nights than that one made it
seem pointless

  why sargent was going out with him
was of more interest

  the beverage you gave me killed all
evil effects before they even came to a bud
he said

   mr hood came out of his office followed
by sargent who carried a long coat on his
arm

  been entertaining conductor daily
smiled mr hood at his daughter as they
were moving to follow sargent and daily
down the stairs  be careful of him he
never does anything just as you expect
there was never a man came to this divi-
sion with a recommendation like his he
came in here one day over three years ago-
thin red-eyed and rather old-and gave
me a letter from an old friend of mine in
the east  this man is as good a one as
i know of when sober-but he is seldom


the railroad mans magazine

sober is the way the letter ran i put him
in the train service expecting the job to
break him hes still there

  daily and sargent turned up the street to
a restaurant half an hour later they had
collected the orders from the despatchers
office the way-bills from the yard office
and soon the freight-train was swinging out
of the yards sargent lounged in the cu-
pola where daily joined him

  the train pushed steadily into the silent
starlit desert sargent and daily seldom
spoke an hour and a half and the sand-
dunes began to loom up on the right

   it was about here the collision occurred
wasnt it sargent finally asked

  daily nodded his eyes still continued
to follow the path of the headlight he
stiffened suddenly and gripped his chair
the air-brakes went on with a roar that
boomed away and lost itself in the desert
cars jammed together savagely and one in
the middle of the train reared and plunged
clear of the track dragging one or two
others with it

  now i saw that daily bit out as the
crash of cars ceased

  sargent arose battered and shaken from
a corner of the cupola

  saw what daily he questioned

   saw a red light swing across the track
come on and lets see what kind of a job
that engineer did stopping us

  they dropped to the ground from the
caboose steps and hurried forward sar-
gent was bruised and excited and gasped
out eager useless questions

  they found dave the head brakenian
swearing indifferently at two cars turned
over and a third with the front trucks
plowed deep into ties and dirt daily
walked around the derailed cars and ex-
amined the track by the light of his lan-
tern sargent followed barking useless
questions and giving useless advice

  well have to cut loose the engine and
run in for help he said  daily this is
a bad spill

  daily rounded on him suddenly

  why did you come out with me to-
night he demanded was it about
these mysterious red lights

   yes and to keep in touch with the
freight service answered the chief clerk
unconsciously using a phrase from mr
hoods instructions

  daily took him by the shoulder and faced
him toward the rear of the train

  do you see that red light down the
track there he asked that is billy
mack my rear brakeman back there flag-
ging you get a lantern from the caboose
run back there and take his place send
mack up here to me now do you think
you can do a decent job of flagging

  dailys tone was fatherly but it came
hard to disobey his orders sargent went
with relief in his heart for he liked little
responsibility

  now well clean up this mess said
daily briskly

  he ordered out cables and flanges and
the other simple paraphernalia from ca-
boose and engine and they began pulling
and hauling at the two cars that lay on
their sides they dragged them clear of
the track and left them the track was
blocked up where the wheels had crushed
through the ties and the front trucks of
the third car were pulled back on the rails

  daily worked his men deliberately with
hardly a glance at his watch for it is not
well to hurry men by reminding them just
how much time they have left

  fifty minutes and they were ready to
start sargent was called in and the train
pushed on through the desert daily and
sargent hung over the railing of the rear
platform of the caboose and watched the
dunes steal softly by

   its a god-forsaken country said sar-
gent shivering at a breath of chill air

   id like to ride through those dunes some
day mused daily thoughtfully  it must
be a queer place ive ridden through the
mountains a great deal but it never struck
me before that the dunes could be interest-
ing did you see that red light a while
ago

iii

tobo recognized few gradations in the
social stratum the occasional satur-
day night dances given at the big railroad
hotel were attended by individuals from
every walk of local life

  on a saturday night when lobo fore-
gathered to enjoy bert daily lounged in a
corner of the hotel office idly watching the
crowd gather and reading a paper

  he saw ellis sargent come in with miss
hood and miss harnett then the dance
started and daily was lost for a time in his
reading he threw away the paper when
sargent sat down beside him nodding
somewhat gloomily
the secret red lights



   mr hood has decided not to investi-
gate the wreck of your train the other night
said the chief clerk  there have been two
more trains stopped at that same place since
then-both of them passenger-trains
sargent in his gloom was growing super-
ficial every one on the division knew this
and knew also that this was but a small
part of the trouble which has visited the
division of late

   among other things an engineer had pret-
ty well torn up his train stopping at sight
of a rag effigy tied across the track so con-
spicuously that it was easy to see the ropes
by which it was fastened cars left on
blind sidings had been run through the de-
railing-switches water-tanks and coal-
chutes had been emptied on the ground by
a mysterious hand and a great many other
destructive happenings had occurred dur-
ing the week

  what do you make of all this bad
luck asked daily eying sargent to see
if the question was impertinent

  blackmail breathed the chief clerk
as if his heart chilled at the mention of the
word we got notice this morning its
from a gang that wants one hundred thou-
sand dollars they threaten to put this di-
vision out of commission if they dont get
it mr hood started east this afternoon to
see the general manager as i was coming
over here i got a message that when his
train stopped at the volcano water-tank
some one cut all the air-hose on the train
and got away without being seen

   daily slid upright in his chair

  well said he slowly its a fight
you cant buy them off this time without
doing it again

   thats what mr hood thinks replied
sargent  but what can we do in this coun-
try of little civilization that is all desert
and mountains either way there will be
trouble

   sure breathed daily  thats mostly
what makes life worth while

   the two drifted to the door of the dining-
room where the couples were dancing and
daily saw why sargent had deserted the
ballroom to talk to him

  glen hood was dancing with a lithe
black-haired man and daily gathered from
the smiles some of the ladies turned on the
couple that something amusing had oc-
curred he guessed that in a contest for
miss hoods favor sargent had lost his head
and his temper and had been vanquished

  as the couple swept by him daily saw
that the man had dark skin and hard fea-
tures for a few moments daily felt that
something in life had gone wrong

   a mexican  he tried the word
doubtfully  a mexican  then de-
liberately a greaser

  the smoky light faded and long shadows
sprang out of the corners of the room the
dancers whirled into a dim circle and dwin-
dled away leaving a face with a straight
nose and a gleaming smile topped with
stiff black hair standing out like a por-
trait  a canvas

  then the will that had driven a broken
body from end to end on the division
gripped him and cleared his mind

  a puncher from the south-or a gam-
bler he decided more calmly  anyway
im going to try to stop him

  daily stepped forward quickly when the
music ceased and stood before glen hood
as she sat down the first quick look of
doubt and estimate she gave him as he
made his request hurt him more than any-
thing else had hurt him in years in that
glance she really took consideration of him
for the first time and judged him then
she accepted him and the mexican melted
away with his gleaming smile

  they danced twice together then freddy
dyer the second-trick despatcher came
and daily strolled out to the veranda

  as he turned slowly out of the doorway
he noticed in the moonlight four men
gathered at the far end of the veranda one
leaned idly against the railing talking in
low insinuating tones with glinting teeth
daily also recognized the back of sargent
the little group stood almost montionless
listening tensely to the speaker

  daily paused doubtfully a call-boy
touched him on the arm holding out his
book the conductor saw that he was to
take an extra east in an hour and signed
the book then he strolled down the long
veranda

  he heard the mexicans low laugh and
saw sargent double up grotesquely in the
dancing light-saw him strike out passion-
ately blindly an amateurish blow at the
mexicans face

  daily drew in quickly the mexicans
nose streamed blood as he came upright with
a springy jump then lie lunged at sar-
gent his arm stiff a slender knife quiver-
ing in the light

  back of daily were three years of rough-


the railroad mans magazine

and-tumble fighting of sudden blind rages
and quick attacks as the mexican lunged
daily caught sargent by the shoulder and
kicked savagely at the hand that held the
knife

  the knife flickered into the sand and the
mexican spat out a spanish oath as he stag-
gered against dailys fist he stumbled
back against the railing holding his wound-
ed hand in dumb pain peering doubtfully
at daily

  then he squared himself on his feet
brushed by them all strode to the veranda-
steps and out toward the railroad-yards

  sargent was trembling under the hand on
his shoulder he turned his white face
twisted into a smile to daily

  thank you he mumbled the fel-
low is a blackguard

  thats all right said daily hurriedly
 i must be off now

  an hour later his train was nosing its
way into the moonlit desert

  for a long time daily sat in his caboose
sorting way-bills the moon dropped over
the rim of the sky and when the conductor
climbed into the cupola beside mack his
brakeman the desert was darkness

   guess theres a tramp on board of us
im goin up ahead to see said mack and
disappeared below

  daily watched the brakemans lantern
swing out over the cars and pause mid-
way on the train from the sudden rush of
sound and chill air he was conscious that
the caboose door had been opened

  the next moment he was peering down
into the grinning face of the mexican

  hallo daily said abruptly how
did you get here

  your brakeman ran me this way so i
came in dont move or ill kill you i
shoot as well with my left hand as with my
right im going to climb up there to that
seat on the opposite side of the cupola from
you so that i can keep an eye on your brake-
man  then you and i will talk 

  the mexican climbed to the seat and
peered ahead at macks lantern still twin-
kling at the middle of the train daily eyed
him curiously then settled back in his
chair smiling quietly

   all right he said  talk your head
off

   i never dreamed of such luck as meet-
ing you so soon again when i hid on this
train grinned the mexican

  the train pushed on through the desert

the two men faced each other with quiet

eyes

   all this clash and friction between us
has given me an inspiration went on the
mexican steadily resting his- revolver com-
fortably on his lap  im going to take you
from your train at volcano and keep you
with me for a time i may kill you but i
don t think so you see i am trying to get
this second-rate railroad to part with a
hundred thousand dollars to be rid of me
but so far it seems to be more inclined to
the company of both myself and the hun-
dred thousand

  dailys eyes danced wickedly

  so you are the fellow thats black-
mailing the division he said softly  well
i dont see just why you are mixing me up
in this deal of dollars all i did to you
was to stop you from sticking a friend of
mine and keep your own royal person alive
and free if you had ever struck sargent
you would have been out of it all by now
but as you see i am not at all grate-
ful glinted the mexican  my kidnap-
ing you will make the railroad sit up and
take a little more notice

    just what are you going to do with me  
asked daily anxiously

   have you stop your train at volcano
get off then signal your train to proceed
there are comrades of mine there who know
i am coming it is best to do as i say
the many-toothed smile gleamed evilly
in the faintly lit cupola daily peered
ahead into the darkness thoughtfully he
saw that his rear brakemans lantern still
spotted the darkness in the middle of the
train then he turned to the mexican de-
liberately

   i dont see the sense of it he com-
plained have you a cigarette i sup-
pose you wont let me get into my own
pockets thanks and a match you
take me away from my work and my pay
and do no good to yourself

  the match flared daily held it to his
cigarette as he talked eagerly

   if you go to stealing men instead of
dollars you will have the whole state
against you instead of the railroad dont
you see that give me another match
will you

  another match flared and daily puffed
hard at the cigarette then he argued on
leaning forward eagerly his voice raised
somewhat above die roar and click of the
hurrying wheels he held the mexicans
r



the secret red lights



attention by tense tone and calm eye as
he talked the mexicans smile became cold
and cruel and his eyes were lit with a
smoldering madness

  you think you will talk your way to
freedom and to life-for you fear death
he cut in coldly you fear death he
repeated  and youll fear it more before-

  the narrow window at the back of the
cupola rasped harshly in its frame as a
rush of cold air struck in from behind
the mexicans hands fluttered helplessly
to the arms of his chair

  in that second of his terror two long
arms ending in two huge slabs of hands
drove in on the cold air seized him by the
shoulders and jerked him backward
through the little window the chair was
broken from its one iron leg the revolver
clattered to the floor

  feet scuffled on the roof of the car as
daily sprang to the open window as he
thrust his head into the darkness he saw
the mexican heaved clear of the car
squirm out of sight

  a pair of boots appeared on a line with
the conductors face and he moved to one
side to let his brakeman slide feet first
through the open window

   i knew the hobo was on the train some
place panted mack as he struck the floor
 it took a lot of nerve for him to come in
here and try to stick you up i saw him
when you struck the first match what
was he trying to do to you anyway 

  daily bit out short sentences of explana-
tion as he dropped to the floor and reached
for his lantern

  here he ordered as he thrust the
lantern up at mack  stop her weve
got to go back there and hunt-for that
fellow

   i couldnt help throwing him off
mack apologized as he wormed through the
window he fought like a cat

  macks lantern swooped back and forth
in the quick half-circle of the wash-out
some one in the cab saw the signal the
whistle screeched and the brakes began to
nip the wheels

  daily lit another lantern picked up the
fallen revolver and swung off the train be-
fore it had stopped

  he ran along the track to the point near
where the mexican had lit and swung his
lantern mack joined him and they both
searched for half an hour but found not so
much as a track in the sand

  anyway we couldnt see much in this
lantern light daily complained we
cant find him that fall would have killed
a white man this fellow has crawled out
of the way and is most likely watching us
trying to decide whether to pot us or not
they tramped back to the caboose the
shadows played about their feet in the circle
of lantern light a light bobbed at the rear
of the train and dave the head brakeman
swung about to stride beside them to hear
what had happened

  let him ramble now said daily as
they came up to the caboose his lantern
doubled in the air and the air-brakes whis-
tled  dave run forward and tell the en-
gineer to stop at the next station

  more track began to drone in the dark-
ness behind them daily and mack brood-
ed silently in the caboose while the desert
whispered by as they came to a stop at
thunder creek the two swung off and
walked into the office where the night opera-
tor idled away life at the telegraph-desk

   ask the operator at volcano if he has
noticed any punchers or armed man loafing
about his station this evening said daily

  the operator rippled a call the instru-
ment chattered for a few seconds

   volcano says theres some cow-men or
something like that camped over by the
corrals but they havent any wagon wit
them says one of em kept inquiring for
a telegram and about nine oclock this
evening he got one from lobo

   tell the operator said daily to keep
an eye on them then you tell the despatcher
that we are going to stop at volcano for a
little time so he neednt lay anything out
for us i want all the guns you have about
the shack

  theres the agents sawed-off shotgun
and his rifle over there in the corner
theres a revolver under the ticket-window
and one here in my desk the operator
enumerated

   you fellows must be always looking for
trouble grinned daily  ill take all but
your revolver and send them back to you to-
morrow

 be careful of the shotgun warned the
operator its dangerous at both ends
the three took the guns and walked to
the engine in a few minutes the train was
moving again

  daily mack and dave swung onto the
caboose and mounted to the cupola

   its funny what can happen in such a


the railroad mans magazine

little time-aint it said mack as he
began to hum will there be any stars
in my crown  in a nasal buzz

   this cannon is bound to scatter shot
all over the country complained dave
who had the sawed-off shotgun  you fel-
lows will have to stay well back of me when
i go into action if you get into my line of
fire youll get your lights put out

  the train swung into the yards at vol-
cano and stopped with the caboose just out-
side the front windows of the station

  the engineer and fireman dropped from
their engine and walked through the yards
toward the back of the depot daily jumped
to the platform and walked to the office
leaving his two brakeinen crouched in the
doorway of the caboose

  have you seen anything more of those
fellows who got that message from lobo
daily questioned the sleepy operator

   theyre over there by the corral yet i
guess the operator mumbled drowsily
 theres four of them

  some one outside called something and
daily swung around to the doorway a
second later four men rode restive horses
into the light that streamed from the open
window and door one riding in close and
peering down at the conductor

  bo you belong to that train de-
manded the man on the horse

  hands up-all came macks excited
yell from the rear end of the caboose

  a horseman turned in his saddle and
fired all in one quick writhe of the body
and turn of the wrist that showed practise
in that exercise

  the bullet plunked into the caboose over
the heads of the brakemen who were crouch-
ed behind the sheet of steel hung on the
railing of the platform the horseman
fired twice again in as many seconds and
the horses danced and plunged

  daily knelt down in the shadow under
the lighted window and fired at the man
nearest him macks rifle spat wickedly
and four or five guns blazed at once

  the operator seated in the window
seemed to be in the greatest danger but he
was accustomed to such scenes and quickly
slid to safety under his table

  with a roar that drowned all other sounds
to mere cracklings dave let go both bar-
rels of the sawed-off shotgun a horse
snorted a man yelled and cursed shot
ripped through the windows and bored
into the station walls

  with that shot the firing ceased flying
hoofs rang on the track and plowed away
into the desert a man began muttering to
himself

  daily crouched for a little time longer
in the shadow to see if any pain would de-
velop he felt nothing unusual so he
reckoned that by some accident no buck-
shot had found him

  gosh he breathed and stood up

  he turned into the station to fetch a
lamp

  the light showed one horse and two men
down on the cinder platform one of the
men raised on his arm and took a quick
shot at the light in dailys hand and ex-
tinguished it

   dont do that again warned a voice
daily get another light it was the en-
gineer

  daily got another light the outlaw
surrendered his revolver to the engineer

  where are you hurt asked daily

   all over mostly answered the man
and fainted

  lets see where mack and dave are
said daily

  mack they found sitting close beside the
caboose nursing his head in both hands
he peered up at them round-eyed 

   dave is around here some place ne
told them  i cant hear a thing you say
the noise of that gun knocked me crazy
it knocked dave down then kicked him
twice after that

  they found dave on the flat of his back
and the shotgun on top of him

  they gathered up the wounded and took
them into the office to look them over both
of the outlaws were senseless dave opened
his eyes to the lamplight to ask for a drink
and mack walked the floor holding his
head

   this is an awful mess complained
the engineer who sickened at the sight of
so much blood  but they should have
known better than to tackle us he added
and his face cleared a little

   of course they should said daily
briskly  send your fireman over to the
town for a doctor

  the conductor pulled the sleepy oper-
ator from under the telegraph table and
set him in his chair

  no need sending for a doctor said
the operator his fists in his eyes there
aint any but theres whisky

  daily began scribbling on a pad of paper
the secret red lights



  tell the despatcher this he ordered
the operator pushing the paper under his
nose and ask him if we shall go on to
newpoint with these fellows

  the operator reached for his key after
a few moments he looked up

   the despatcher says you had better go
on in with your train lie said  then pick
up the sheriff at newpoint and come back
to find the mexican if you can he says
theres no one in command now that mr
hood has gone east for sargent is afraid
to issue an order you are very likely to
get fired whatever you do

  all right said daily well go in

iv

 n hour later daily was in newpoint
pulling the sheriff from bed

  ive got a job for you he told the
sheriff

-	he sat on the bed and talked while the
officer got into his clothes

   i can get two men and enough horses
within half an hour the sheriff said
you get the train ready and ill meet
you at the station

  another hour and they were careening
westward racing behind a sleek little
engine to be on hand at daylight in a
box car between the engine and the caboose
were four horses another conductor was
in charge of the train for daily was to ride
with the sheriff

   i am going to sleep like a dog said
daily as he stretched himself out on a
cushioned bench

  the sun was up when the train stopped
at the point where mack had tossed the
mexican from the top of the caboose after
a good deal of searching about in the sand
they found where the mexican had landed
on his feet bounded forward a few steps
then plowed up the sand in a hard fall
his trail began there dragged across the
desert and was lost in the shimmering heat

    get out the horses ordered the sheriff
from the swing of his feet that fellow is
pretty well in towards the mountains by
this time we have likely come too late
but well give him a try

  the horses were unloaded and saddled
the four men mounted

  you may as well run into la salle and
ask for orders daily told the conductor
in charge of the train  we wont need
you any more

  they spurred away into the silent waste
and aching glare of the sun it was like
riding into a furnace

  by eleven oclock the trail had led them
into the shadow of the mountains at
noon it ceased in a rocky canon

  this is his own country said the
sheriff as he looked up at the mountains
theres  use trying to find him here
daily weve lost

   i dont like to think we have come all
this way for nothing daily complained
lets try a little farther that fellow
may have dropped just around the next turn
of the canon wall

  we may be riding straight into hell
said the sheriff that canon is narrow
and high and once in it were in a hole
for sure if the mexican had won through
all right hes sure to have picked up some
of his men and may be waiting for us
shall we go in asked daily quietly
 oh i guess so answered the sheriff
and they rode forward

  they made the first turn and the canon
lay there blankly before them at the next
turn it lost itself in the gloom of its own
towering walls

  no good said the sheriff sullenly i
wont risk it further

   do you see that black lump in the
shadow against the wall ahead there
asked daily pointing  i am two-thirds
sure its a rock or a log but im going to be
sure it isnt the mexican you stay here
he walked his horse forward for three
hundred yards found the lump to be a
mound of earth and then he faced back
he reined in as a rock clattered down the
mountainside

  a rifle spoke faintly from high above
dailys horse sank to its knees with a tired
grunt and the conductor leaped to safety

  the sheriff spurred for daily then
two rifles spoke sharply from above and
the sheriff threw himself clear of his own
horse as it went down one of his men
was at his side in another moment he
hauled the sheriff up behind him and the
two horses clattered swiftly out of sight

  daily was left alone he cleared the
width of the canon in a swift sprint sprang
up at a handful of dry shrubs caught
them and pulled himself up among the
rocks where he lay for a few moments
the marksmen above began to pester him
with bullets that spat uncomfortably close
daily glanced upward along the moun-


the railroad mans magazine

tain wall then began slowly to climb
higher to a spot more on a line with the
marksman his progress was followed by
the steady persistent spit of bullets and
it was an hour before he plumped down
panting behind a huge boulder

  the bullets pecked about him for a little
while longer then ceased

   those fellows will about move around
where they can get me going and coming
commented daily idly fingering the loose
stones  and then where am i  

  he scanned the bare walls above him
then peered out at the rocks which concealed
the marksman the range was too great
for his revolver so he lay down and watch-
ed the mountains above and below

  after an hour he caught a movement
far to the left a second later a bullet
threw dust in his face another bounced
from the rock a little above his head
daily threw himself into a small niche and
thrust his revolver forward he fired at
the next puff of smoke and for the next
few moments answered shot for shot

  he played for time and darkness he
reasoned that the sheriff would return by
daylight of the next day with more men to
rescue him with the fall of darkness he
hoped to avoid the otitlaws

  rut the lone marksman on the mountain-
side seemed intent that the sun should not
set on daily alive he drew down nearer
a shot gently touched dailys coat-sleeve
daily crowded more of himself into the
niche but the next shot came from a dif-
ferent angle and cut his arm

   ouch  protested daily

  a dry mirthless laugh came from behind
a boulder daily watched the big rock
with restless eyes and when a gun-barrel
showed over the top of it he promptly fired

  the rifle slid from sight then reap-
peared cautiously around the side of the
boulder daily fired again but the answer-
ing shot came close on his own and a bul-
let slit open the tip of his shoulder

  anxiously he calculated the distance to
the boulder and gathered himself for a
rush the blue barrel came slowly in sight
again daily fired three times quickly
and held still and tense waiting for the
stinging bullet from the rifle to strike

  then and no sooner would he rush the
man on the other side of the boulder

  in the pause his eyes swept the moun-

tains swiftly the shadows were become
long and dark in the low land

   why didnt he fire his heart beat off
 the seconds distinctly and audibly one
 two three his restless eyes turned down-
 ward in a racing glance then his caught
 breath went out in a long slow whisper

  the impossible had happened a sad-
dle-horse strayed from others belonging to
the outlaws came slowly down the canon
pulling at tufts of dry grass as it came
three more heart-beats and it was almost
beneath him he could plainly see the
bridle hanging from the saddle

   dailys eyes were pivoted on the gun-
barrel nestling at the side of the boulder
the top of a black head came in line with
the glowing steel and daily fired again
the horse raised its head curiously then
continued grazing the top of the black
head was withdrawn

   then the horse thrust out its nose planted
 its feet and snorted it had come to
 dailys horse shot in the trail

   daily bunched himself rose and leaped
 the boulder in front of him he went to-
 bogganing down the mountain starting a
 mass of earth and stones twice he turned
 over to right himself and spit out dirt he
 struck the trail and went sprawling on

   he jumped to his feet half blinded and
 seized the horse before it could elude him
 ran a few steps as it shied past the dead
 horse then swung to the saddle the horse
 leaped forward in a few short stiff jumps
 then struck into a long racing stride

  guns began to sputter and spit from
both sides of the canon the saddle bow
was torn away under dailys hand a sting-
ing wound in his side grew into an agon-
izing ache

   the mountains began to careen and fade
 away and the sky flamed and seethed like
 liquid fire but he set his grip on the sad-
 dle and swept around the first turn in the
 canon around the second and away to
 the desert

  his burning straining eyes photo-
graphed the riotous scene as he looked
backward high on a sliver of rock seem-
ing to move with the swaying mountains
a slim figure with a puffing revolver in
the left hand was carved even after a
filmy darkness settled down and blotted out
all else that lone figure remained a darker
blot against the blackness

by edgar welton cooley

there was something doing in the baggage and
express departments when mr grimm got busy

mi s grimm arose suddenly
from die dinner table and
hastening into the adjoin-
ing room took from her
 ample purse a brass bag-
gage-check

   in the excitement of my home-coming
and of greeting you and the children mr
grimm she said  i quite forgot this but
i wish james-mrs grimm always used
his given name in addressing her husband
whenever she desired to add emphasis to her
remarks- i wish james you would have
my baggage sent up this afternoon-i want
to unpack it at once

   your baggage  mr grimm looked at
his wife interrogatingly  if i remember
aright my dear we brought your grip with

us in the auto you did not take a trunk
with you did you mrs grimm

   i am fully aware that what you say is
true mr grimm his wife replied impa-
tiently  but i have some baggage at the
station it is a box mr grimm

  a box james g grimm was evi-
dently surprised  did you say it was a
box miriam

  a box replied his wife severely a
common cracker-box you see she ex-
plained further sister jenevieve gave me
so many things for myself and the children
that i could not get them all in my grip
so i put them in a box put handles on the
box and checked it

   how thoughtful  said mr grimm
 i shall have the box brought up at once

if i remember aright my dear we
brought your grip with us
in the auto

the railroad mans magazine

  very well james replied his wife
grimly  see that you do

  a half-hour later james g grimms
auto stopped in front of the office of the
fairfax transfer company and mr
grimm with such dignity as naturally be-
came the president of the security savings
bank alighted from the machine and ap-
proached the desk where a clerk greeted
him cordially mr grimm took the bag-
gage-check from his pocket and laid it upon
the counter

    i wish he said pompously  you would
have that baggage taken to my house at
once my wife is in a hurry

   certainly certainly replied the clerk
is it a grip mr grimm or a trunk
neither replied mr grimm its
a box

   a box  the clerk was gazing at him
curiously

   a box reiterated mr grimm  a
common cracker-box

  indeed said the clerk a peculiar in-
tonation in his voice

  mr grimms face flushed it had sud-
denly occurred to him that the clerk might
think he compelled his wife to check her
belongings in a box

    of course it is none of your business
he vouchsafed rather curtly but i might
explain-

   it isnt necessary interrupted the
clerk

   i might explain resumed mr grimm
 that my wife was visiting her sister in
dalton and wishing to ship this box home
she had handles put on it and checked it
as baggage

    i see smiled the clerk understanding-
ly nothing like beating the express com-
pany when you can eh mr grimm

  the clerk was a keen young man fur-
thermore he was a brother of the local agent
of the express company which was one of
the heaviest depositors in the security sav-
ings bank mr grimm began to feel de-
cidedly uncomfortable

  that wasnt the reason at all he re-
turned  you see my wife didnt have her
trunk with her and she had so many things
to bring home that she couldnt get them all
in her grip-

 i see said the clerk for the second time
for a moment mr grimm continued to
stare at the clerk then he went his way
feeling that he would give a good deal to
know what the clerk was thinking about

   other matters howeverso intruded them-
selves upon mr grimms attention during
the afternoon that he did not give so much
as a passing thought to either mrs
grimms baggage or the inquisitive transfer
clerk but no sooner had lie entered his
home that evening than his wife greeted
him in an accusing voice

  james she called down to him from
the head of the stairs  why didnt you have
my baggage sent up  

  mr grimm paused and gazed up at her
 i did order it sent up he replied
 didnt it come

   no replied his wife in evident ill hu-
mor  and james the children are so anx-
ious to get the tilings sister jenevieve sent
them that the poor little dears wont give
me a moments rest until the box comes
confound that talkative clerk broke
in mr grimm hotly  if hed ask less
questions and give more attention to busi-
ness-but just wait my dear ill stir him
up as he never was stirred up before 

  a moment later mr grimm was in com-
munication over the wire with the fairfax
transfer company on the part of mr
grimm at least the conversation was ex-
ceedingly animated while it lasted but pres-
ently the president of the security savings
bank was compelled to temporarily discon-
tinue the transmission of vehement language
for the reason that there was no one listen-
ing at the other end of the wire

  the clerk was making an investigation
of the cause of the delay in delivering mrs
grimms baggage during which mr grimm
contented himself in scowling at the in-
offensive telephone and formulating for
possible future use a series of brand-new
remarks sufficiently tropical to blister at
ten paces

  presently the clerk announced the result
of the investigation the reason he con-
fided to mr grimm that mrs grimms
cracker-box had not been transferred to the
grimm mansion was because mrs grimms
cracker-box had not arrived at the station

  the transfer company mr grimm was
informed patronizingly would keep a sharp
lookout for the box and immediately it
arrived-

    bali  yelled mr grimm over the wire
why dont you tell me the truth why
dont you admit that you forget to send a
man after it that you overlooked it or some-
thing like that why do you tell me it
hasnt come because of course it has
check --



  but really it hasnt come persisted
the clerk

   bah  exclaimed mr grimm for the
third time  bah  and he hung up the
receiver with a loud noise

  james mrs grimm had descended
the stairs and now stood facing him  did
he say the box hasnt come  

  nonsense said mr grimm explo-
sively stuff and nonsense my dear
thats just a subter-
fuge to cover their
own mistake 

  but james sup-
pose it is lost oh
why did you trust
others to look after
it why didnt you
go to the station
yourself

   because the han-
dling of baggage be-
ing an important part
of the fairfax
transfer companys
business my dear
began mr grimm de-
fensively  i had rea-
son to believe that
they were competent
to attend to the mat-
ter but i find i was
mistaken

  of course you
were mistaken re-
plied his wife com-
plainingly you are
always mistaken

you are always do-
ing the wrong thing
when so much de-
pends on doing the
right

  but my dear expostulated mr
grimm

  james mrs grimm waxed impera-
tive  for goodness sake dont stand there
and argue matters go to the station at
once mr grimm and have that baggage
brought me immediately

  but its six oclock expostulated the
president of the security savings bank in a
weak voice and im hungry miriam

  his wife favored him with a withering
glance

   why she asked  must you always
give so much consideration to your stomach
and so little to other matters think of

our poor children fretting for their presents
and of that box that perhaps is lost oh

pleaseget it james 

  mr grimm did not waste further words
on the unappreciative ears of his wife in-
stead he hastened out to his automobile
cranked the machine and was soon speed-
ing toward the station a few moments
later he faced the baggageman at the chi-
cago and missouri river depot

  where he be-
gan impressively  is
my wifes baggage i
want it immediately
the baggage-mas-
ter did not seem over-
awed ly mr grimms
stern command he
had been in the rail-
road business for ten
years and had met
many occupants of
the seats of the
mighty he calmly
raised his eyes to
those of the banker
calmly held out his
hand and calmly re-
marked

   lets see your
check

 check mr
grimm gasped the
fact that he did not
have the check had
entirely slipped his
mind

   the - the trans-
fer company has it
he stammered  but
you can at least tell
me whether the box
is here cant you  
box did you say it was a box
the baggageman was regarding mr grimm
curiously it is well he fastened
his keen gray eyes upon the president of
the security savings bank the freight
office is across the tracks

  mr grimms anger began to flare he
had come to find out about his wifes bag-
gage not to be informed on the location of
the various departments of the road

   but it wasnt shipped by freight- he
began

   well  the baggage-master was still
regarding him intently  the express of-
fice is up-town

she had handles pcjt on it and checked
it as baggage


the railroad mans magazine

  but confound it snapped mr
grimm  i dont care a continental where
the infernal express office is the box
wasnt shipped by express it was sent as
baggage dont you understand bag-
gage it was checked 

  checked the baggage-master re-
garded him doubtfully  didnt you say it
was a box  

  yes roared mr grimm defiantly

 it was a box - a common cracker-box
didnt you ever see a box checked  

   ive seen boxes checked that had han-
dles on em admitted the baggageman
 but when they have handles they are
classed as trunks

   and who said my wifes box didnt have
handles snapped mr grimm impatient-
ly it has

   but virtually all the boxes i ever saw
checked resumed the baggageman calmly

 belonged to emigrants it would seem that
anybody could afford a trunk you can get
a fairly good one for three ninety-eight

  mr grimm plunged his hands into his
trousers-pockets and expanded his chest

  no doubt he said regarding the bag-
gageman savagely you would like to have
me go into all the details and explain fully
how my wi fe was compelled to check a box
but i shall not i dont see that it is any
of your business i simply want
to know if the box is here 

    if you havent the check with
you replied the baggage-master
in a wholly unruffled manner
 perhaps you can give me the
number of it

  the number no i didnt
notice the number

    then replied the other turn-
ing his attention to a report he had
been making out how can you
expect me to give you any infor-
mation as we handle between
five and six hundred pieces of
baggage every day it is not
easy-

  of course snarled mr
grimm  i didnt expect you to
give me any information i never
met a baggage-master who would
i merely called because it seems to
be the custom of passengers having
baggage to make occasional in-
quiries but since you insist upon
seeing my check i will get it just
to prove to you that i have a
check when i return-

  he paused in the oorway to
glare threateningly at the bag-
gage-master-who never raised his
eyes from his desk

  when mr james g grimm
again entered the office of the
fairfax- transfer company he
was not in a very amiable frame
of mind he was accustomed to
dining punctually at six every evening but
it was now six - thirty and he had not had
his evening meal

  the night clerk was answering a tele-
phone call and mr grimm was compelled
to wait until he was at liberty the delay
did not awaken any cheerfulness upon the
part of the banker

  give me that check he roared when
the clerk advanced to the counter

  the night clerk not having been in the

check --



employ of the transfer company to exceed
forty-eight hours was rather timid and the
sudden explosion upon the part of mr
grimm startled him

   yea-yes sir he replied confusedly
 bag-baggage-check or bank-check sir 
 baggage - check  thundered mr
grimm glad that at length he had discov-
ered some one he could overawe by the im-
portance of his personality the check
for my wifes baggage i left here this aft-
ernoon

  ah yes the clerk nervously turned
the pages of a big book he was slowly
recovering his presence of mind  what is
the name please

  the president of the security savings
bank regarded the clerk pityingly he was
wondering how any one could be so densely
ignorant

   grimm he replied presently with all
the impressiveness he could command-
 james g grimm

   ah yes  the clerk ran his finger
down one of the pages in the big book
 grimm grimm-ah yes here it is
check no ---was that the
number  

   how do i know   growled mr grimm
impatiently  if i knew i wouldnt be
here now i would be at home enjoying a
hearty meal instead of standing here wait-
ing for you to make up your mind to give
me that check

   ah yes  the clerks finger was fol-
lowing a written line ah yes driver
no  reports baggage not arrived

  young man interposed mr grimm
conscious of renewed craving in the region
of his stomach  young man i didnt come
here after the baggage i came after that
check if you will be kind enough to give
it to me i will return to the station and get
the box myself

   box   the expression upon the night
clerks face suddenly changed the light
of comprehension glimmered in his eyes
did you say it was a box mr grimm
the president of the security savings
bank sighed heavily

  yes he almost gasped it is a box-
a cracker-box-it has handles on it-my
wife-

   a box   the young man closed the
big book with a bang  i have been look-
ing in the wrong book i was thinking you
were inquiring about baggage but if it is
freight-

  who said it was freight roared mr
grimm pounding the counter with his fist
 do i have to stand here stifling hunger
while i recite for your edification a com-
plete history of that box do i i wont
i swear i wont i came after that check
and i intend to have it now young man
are you going to give it to me 

   ah yes the check-you want the
check 

  do i want it yelled mr grimm re-
garding the other vindictively  heavens
and earth didnt i say i wanted it
didnt i ask for it a half-hour ago

  but why do you want the check ex-
postulated the clerk  you certainly can-
not get the box until it arrives our men
meet every train and as soon as the box
comes-

   bah   mr grimm could scarcely con-
ceal his disgust i know it has come i
know it has been here since eleven fifteen
this morning if you think i am an easy
mark that i can be held up for storage
charges so that the railroad and transfer-
companies may divide the spoils you are
mistaken for the third andlast time i
will ask you for that check 

  ah very well the clerk removed
from a nail on the end of the desk a large
hook from which dangled numerous checks
and tags these he ran over hurriedly
then returned the hook to its nail

  i am sorry he said but the check is
still in the possession of driver no 

  mr grimm groaned and paced the floor
for a full minute then he turned to the
clerk

  and where he asked is driver
no 

   he is probably at supper replied the
night clerk  he lives- he removed a
small book from a shelf and opened it
 he lives at  pine street

  mr grimm groaned again and glanced
at his watch it was fifteen minutes of
seven

   very well  he said determinedly  i
am hungry i have had nothing to eat since
noon but i never undertake anything with-
out seeing it through i shall go to no
 pine street i shall see driver no 
and i shall get the check

   i wouldnt began the clerk sympa-
thetically  he can get the box as quickly
as you- 

  but the president of the security savings
bank had departed


the railroad mans magazine

  as soon as he could cover the two and
a half miles that intervened without vio-
lating the speed ordinance mr grimm
pounded upon the door at  pine street
a man answered the summons

   are you began mr grimm  driver
no  for the fairfax transfer company 
you are very well my name is grimm
-james g grimm i left a baggage-check
at the office shortly after noon you report-
ed that the box had not arrived you still
have that check you will please give it
to me

  a box driver no  was plainly
surprised  did i understand you to say-
stop mr grimm-was breathing
heavily  it is a box with handles it
was not shipped by either freight or express
my wife checked it as baggage she has a
trunk-in fact she has several trunks but
this is a box a common cracker-box now
that i have supplied you with all the in-
formation at hand will you please give me
that check  

   but began driver no  doubtfully
how am i to know that you are mr
grimm how am i to know that you have
a right to the check you see the company
is responsible-

    heavens  groaned the president of the
security savings bank desperately  must
i identify myself out here in a part of town
where there isnt a soul that knows me
man im hungry i havent had a bite
since noon 

  youre hungry eh asked driver no
 suspiciously  havent had anything to
eat since noon eh  and yet you would
have me believe that you are president of
the security savings bank would you
say whats your game anyhow

  what gasped mr grimm fairly
gnashing his teeth  do you think im a
tramp do tramps wear silk hats and
ride in automobiles what

   no admitted driver no   but i
never heard of a bank president going hun-
gry in a town this size you may be mr
grimm he added soothingly  but you
see i must comply with the companys rules
i am not allowed to return baggage-checks
to strangers who have not been identified
anyway the box hasnt arrived it cant
come now until seven-thirty you had bet-
ter go home and let us deliver the box as
soon as-

  no declared mr grimm stubbornly
 i shall get it myself

  all right said driver no  glancing
at his watch  im due at the depot in a
half-hour if youll meet me there and get
some one to vouch for you ill give you
the check

  mr grimm drew another long sigh
 very well he said resignedly  and in
the meantime-by jove ill have time to
get a lunch

  on this particular occasion fortune was
not kind to james g grimm scarcely had
he traveled three blocks when a tire burst
with a loud and disheartening report mr
grimm got out and ruefully surveyed the
damage then he glanced about him in
dismay

  there was not a restaurant or hotel or
store or any place wherein so much as a
cracker might be purchased nor was there
a car-line within five blocks

   heavens  exclaimed mr grimm
then he went in search of a telephone which
he presently found

  after some delay and much telephoning
he secured a promise from a garage to send
a tire at once a half-hour later-a half-
hour in which mr grimm alternately paced
the street and swore and sat on the curbing
and gave himself up to bitter thoughts-the
tire arrived

  even then notwithstanding mr grimms
urgent and oft-repeated demands for haste
another thirty minutes elapsed before he
could continue his journey

  when he reached the station and stormed
into that portion of the depot allotted to
transfer-men driver no  was not in evi-
dence nor could any of the odier drivers
give any information as to his probable
whereabouts

  well declared mr grimm violently
 this is a pretty way to do business isnt
it its a conspiracy between the railroad
and transfer companies but i shant be
held up i swear i shant ill show
em

  mr grimm was hungry desperately
hungry his hunger was growing more in-
tense every moment but he pressed his lips
firmly together climbed into his automobile
and once more sped to the office of the fair-
fax transfer company

  the night clerk was still on duty and he
smiled a greeting to mr grimm unfor-
tunately he could give the banker no infor-
mation driver no  had not been at the
office since mr grimm was last there re-
garding check no -s- the night
check --



week

 mulct me for storage charges the transfer
 company refuses to surrender your check
 but ill show em ill show em ill
 swear out a warrant ill have an attach-
 ment issued ill-

  janies the wife spoke command-
ingly what in the world is the matter
with you mr grimm

 clerk knew nothing further than that it must
 still be in the hands of driver no 

   mr grimm visited his wrath upon the
night clerk without reservatiol he freely
expressed his opinion of the fairfax trans-
fer company and every one connected with
it and finally after threatening sufficient
civil and criminal actions to have caused a

legal shark to hug himself to death he
turned his machine homeward

  every throb of his auto increased the in-
tensity of his anger every whiff of gasoline
added fuel to the flames of his overwhelm-
ing indignation so that when he reached
his home he was little less than a raging
volcano

  perspiring at every pore he burst into the
astonished presence of his wife

   miriam  he cried  theres a con-
spiracy to defraud-a deep-laid plot to

  whats the matter mr grimm was
pacing the floor like a wild animal its
your box they wont let me have it 
my box mr grimm why will you
persist in always working yourself into a
frenzy over nothing the box ishere
the transfer-man brought it a half-hour
ago it came on the seven-twenty express
mr grimm sank wearily into a chair and
dried his moist brow presently he said
heavens miriam is dinner ready
i-i havent eaten for a week

value of an apprenticeship

there is nothing that will ever take the place
of an apprenticeship there is no trade-
school or training-school in the country that will
turn out young men or boys who are capable of
entering a shop and competing with the average
mechanic while they may be taught considerable
 book learning their practical instruction must
of necessity be limited there is nothing that
will take the place of practical experience manu-

al training in our public schools may bring out
the talent may display the genius but the fra-
ternities and sororities of our high school system
have made too many boys who are natural-born
mechanics  shun  the actual work and dread
the thought of an apprenticeship it not being in
keeping with the social and snobbish ideas gained
from the fraternities and societies while passing
through high school-american engineer

can you explain the path of the current from
the trolley-wire of an electric car through
the gearing and how it produces speed-
w o mcd yates center kansas

  electric currents for railway purposes are gen-
erated in a machine called a dynamo the dyna-
mo is very much like a large motor in construction
it is driven by a steam engine and gives out a
current of electricity the current flows out of
the machinc at the positive or -- end through
the machines that are being driven and back to
the dynamo which enters at the negative or -
end the path that the current follows made up
of the dynamo the trolley-wire the car wiring
and motor the track return circuit to the dynamo
is known as the circuit also any path that the
current follows is known as a circuit

  for instance the wiring of a car is known as the
car-circuit and the path that the current takes
within the armature of a motor is known as the
armature-circuit to describe simply the prin-
ciple on which the action is based it may be said
that a magnet is a piece of iron or steel which
lias the property of attracting other pieces of iron
or steel the two ends of a magnet are different
they will both attract iron but if one end of a
single magnet is suspended by a string at the
middle the following facts will be noted if we
call the ends of the first magnet no  and no 
and the ends of the second magnet no  and

no  then if no  is brought near to no 
they will attract each other but if no  be
brought near no  they will repel each other
also no  will attract no  but will repel no 

  this shows that there must be some difference
between the ends of the magnets or they would
act alike this attraction and repulsion between
magnets is the principle on which electric motors
are built in fact the electric consists of a
stationary magnet or  field and a movable
magnet or  armature attached to- a shaft or
axle the field and armature are so arranged
that they cannot touch each other though the
armature can revolve very near the field the
moving magnet is drawn to the fixed magnet
and just as it arrives the current is turned off so
that it flies past

  as soon as it passes the center of the field the
current is turned on again in the opposite direc-
tion so that they now repel each other and so
on as long as the current flows the movable ar-
mature is kept revolving this turns the shaft
and the shaft turns the car-axle the main parts
of a street railway motor are a field-magnet which
is stationary and a revolving armature the field-
magnet is composed of an iron or a steel casting
which has a certain quantity of insulated wire
wound around it the electricity passing through
this field or wire-coil magnetizes the iron creating
magnetic poles



whats the answer

men
by the light of the lantern



   the revolving armature is composed of thin
 disks of soft sheet iron firmly bolted together and
 fitted on a shaft this being the armature-core
 this is dressed up in a machine-shop and wound
 with a certain number of turns of insulated wire
 which are connected together so as to form one
 continuous wire passing lengthwise around the
 core before the armature is wound the core is
 thoroughly insulated with the best of insulating
 material this is a very important factor in the
 construction of an armature as defective insula-
 tion would cause the windings to ground on the
 core in which case the armature would have to
 be stripped and rewound again

   the shaft upon which the armature is built
 furnishes both a support and a means of trans-
 mitting the power of the armature to the wheels
 by means of its pinion meshing with a gear on
  the truck-axle the winding of the armature is
 the most vital part as it is in this as in the
 field magnets that the current sets up the force
 that causes the motion of the wheels of the car
 when a wire carrying a current is brought in
 front of a pole of a magnet a force is experienced
 which tends to drive the wire sideways from the
 magnet and this is what takes place in an electric
 motor when the windings of an armature car-
 rying current come in front of a pole-piece of
 the field-magnet they are forced away and the
 armature is kept revolving as long as the current
 flows on the end of the armature-shaft is a
 pinion which meshes into a large gear-wheel keyed
 on the truck-axle in this way an electric car is

rd s amhurst massachusetts-a man of

	thirty-four years is oo old to assume the
 duties of a locomotive fireman at least it is so
 viewed by the majority of master mechanics who
 naturally are somewhat chary in accepting an
 applicant of that age when they know he will
 scarcely have the incentive to work which would
 be possessed by a younger man there may of
 course be exceptions to this view but we feel
 pretty safe in asserting that there are none
 your height and weight are acceptable for the
 position of express-messcnger but we fear that
 in this field your age will again prove a barrier

ja c philadelphia-the rather interesting

	calculations which we offered in the feb-
 ruary number of the railroad mans magazine
 in regard to the cost of stopping a train represent
 the compilation of innumerable calculations on
 the part of various railroads and technical col-

 leges and are approximately correct but it would
 be assuming too much to consider them infallible
 we did not calculate them ourselves and are glad
 that we did not as life is most too short for such
 elaborate research without the certainty of definite
 results nothing has been done so far-at least
 we have not been so apprised-along the lines
 of computing the cost of starting a train

if a locomotive is placed with right main-rod
just far enough past the forward center to
open the front steam-port and admit steam
in the front end of the cylinder and then the back
end of the main-rod be disconnected and placed
against a solid post the steam-ports on the left
side covered and the throttle opened will the en-
gine move ahead the length of the guides pro-
vided that the post does not break off-g w v

le garber missouri and others-the stand-

	ard code of whistle-signals on the loco-
motive-whistle makes no provision for three short
blasts while the train is running and no such sig-
nal is embodied in the code of the new york
new haven and hartford the erie and many
other prominent trunk lines whose names need
not be repeated understand however that the
standard code is by no means mandatory or in-
fallible and there is no law to say that a rail-
road cannot make any subtraction therefrom or
addition thereto which it may desire or which
circumstances may dictate in endeavoring to
make these replies as concise and as accurate as
possible to cover general conditions we are com-
pelled to quote uniform procedure if it exists
you will readily recognize the absurdity of con-
fining to a single road if the road or roads which
you mention employ such a signal although there
is nothing to forbid we can assure you that it is
not a signal employed to any extent we had
never heard of it until you brought it to our
attention

the oil used in railroad mens lanterns is
called signal-oil can you tell me of what
this oil is made and if it can be made by
any one-c m s omaha nebraska

  it is made of two parts kerosene to one part
lard-oil some favor equal parts of the two oils
in compounding the mixture but that first men-
tioned may be regarded as the standard formula
if the oil embodies a larger percentage of lard-
oil the wick of the lamp is extremely likely to
char as its capillary attraction is lessened through
the higher specific gravity any one can make
signal-oil simply pour it together in the pro-
portion indicated

gd f raleigh north carolina-the term

	 copperhead  was first applied to a loco-
motive in connection with those turned out from


the railroad mans magazine



the old grant locomotive works in paterson
new jersey the appellation arose from the fact
that for some years the standard grant engines
had steam-domes lagged with polished brass
this we think is the true explanation of the
name if it has cropped out subsequently to that
row somewhat remote period we will have to
leave further explanation in the hands of some
of our good friends

hp s cincinnati-so long as you are re-

	siding in cincinnati we would advise
you to get the information desired first hand from
the cincinnati hamilton and dayton offices we
have a fair grip on the pulse of the railroad situa-
tion but it is somewhat beyond us to enter into
historical details regarding an individual engine

the schemeof american railroading the balti-
more and ohio railroad is credited with the most
elaborate and instructive exhibit at the st louis

how many miles of track and how many lo-

 l the canadian northern is  miles

  	the canadian northern and the canadian
northern ontario are practically merged at least
so far as the general impression exists in rail-
road circles - william mackenzie and d b
mann both of toronto ontario arc respectively
president and vice-president of both companies
and this also applies to d b hanna third vice-
president we worked for some time pn your
query and could not secure facts but the above
is the inference whicftis about all we can do at
this writing the canadian northern quebec is
practically independent of the above

  	it does not appear to be the general im-
pression wing that it is independent it might
be well to say that before dismissing this par-
ticular question the actual control of certain rail-
roads is a matter somewhat involved in obscurity
it is a fairly safe rule to follow when two roads
have the same president and general officers to
assign a control between one or the other but
the exact nature of the control or whether repre-
sented by a long time lease or an actual purchase
can be satisfactorily answered only by an execu-
tive of the company we can recall instances
where the president of one road served in the same
capacity on another with absolutely no community
of financial interests present but of course this
is a positive exception the logical inference in
such cases would be that the two roads were

practically consolidated and that the same policies
were being followed in the instance of each

london to bristol  miles in  minutes
  miles per hour and several others it will
be noted that although the average english run-
ning time is very high the runs are shorter

  the paris-calais boat-train is a straightaway
dash of  miles which is scheduled to be made
in  minutes without a single stop

  the longest non-stop run in this country on a
fast schedule is from toledo ohio to elkhart
indiana on the l s and m s  miles on
which the running time is some less than in the
above quoted instance there is of course a
considerable discrepancy in weights behind the
tender that of the twentieth century limited
occasionally rising to  tons while that of
the paris-calais boat-train seldom exceeding 
tons in the mere question of speed however
this latter train can easily claim supremacy over
the railroads of the world for that distance

has a wireless operator any more privileges
than a railroad telegrapher aboard ship
has he anv more privileges than a seaman
-r b p d and h r r

  a railroad operator goes home when his trick
is finished he is free until it comes around
again you will no doubt grasp the point that
a man in the same capacity on shipboard is
practically working all the time so long as only
one operator is carried which is usually the case

  the wireless man at sea must sleep in proximity
to his instruments so that he may be in readiness
to handle any call which may- come in his
operating-room is fitted with a bunk and there
are various other conveniences for his comfort
the pay averages about  per month and board
there is no comparison whatever between this
work and that of a seaman the wireless operator
is well taken cijre of has no menial work to per-
form and his duties are light and pleasant the
pay would not exactly appeal to some of us but
when it is remembered that what is earned is
absolutely clear it may not be so bad after all
the drawbacks are being away from home all
the time and being constantly on duty but there
are compensating advantages

of that or any other type yet to be constructed
it has driving-wheels  inches in diameter and
weighs independent of its tender  pounds

proximately  tons the boiler is  feet in
diameter works under a pressure of  pounds
and has a total heating surface including the

connected to eight coupled drivers  inches in
diameter and two low - pressure cylinders 
inches in diameter by  inches stroke in all prob-
ability this locomotive will not be exceeded in
total weight for a very long time-if ever the
impression seems now current among prominent
motive-power men that the limit has been reached
with the big engine and that a reaction is in-
evitable those constructed since the advent of
this locomotive display a marked tendency to-
ward reversion to a lighter type and this will no
doubt shortly follow

  	the steepest grade is on the el paso

leave up the side rod on the working side of the

the reason that the power is applied to that side
of the engine only and the pin must be either
above or below the center to enable the engine to
move and they will all be sure to move in one

the railroad mans magazine

connected engine as well as the eight-wheel class
no harm will result to the driving-boxes and
the wheels will trail all right on the dead side
this may be a slight deviation from general
practise but it will work and will save taking
down the side rod on the good side in addition
to giving the engine two wheels to come in with
instead of one

  	types of locomotives are now generally
designated according to whytes classification
which lias been repeatedly referred to and ex-
plained in this department it is based on a
combination of numbers representing the arrange-
ment of the wheels for instance the eight-
wheel connected engine which you mentioned
above was formerly called the american type but
is now -- in other words it has a four-
wheel truck which explains the first number
four connected driving-wheels which explains the
second number and no trailer-truck so a cipher
is added a tandem compound engine is or was
generally built with a two-wheel leading-truck
five connected drivers and no trailer hence

-- and others particularly on the santa fe
were -- the ten-wheel connected engine-
with a pony-truck and trailer which you mention
is -- or the now well-known pacific type
which is used very extensively for heavy passen-
ger work

-  the addition of a trailer changes the type
of a locomotive through the addition of the third
number to the classification as explained above

comer or starting point as the engine gains in
speed the steam  cuts off shorter in other
words it does not follow the piston so far in the
cylinders before the valve closes the admission-

closing is effected by the expansive force of the
steani thus a great saving in steam is made over
allowing it to follow the piston at the initial

  story of a

t was lately on a train observed the timid

  a passenger  that went so fast it was dan-
gerous to look out of the window as you were
likely to have your eyesight broken off and carried
away why the very farmhouses looked like the
street of a village they came so fast and the hind
car-wheels touched the rails only once in a while

   there was not a particle of noise to be heard
because the train got far ahead of it and people
along the track said the noise kept about a mile
back the dust didnt have time to get up and
dust until the train had got far away and the
way it then got up and dusted was a warning
the telegraph-poles were not visible and the very
sunbeams did not have a chance to get in the
windows and of course the shadow of the cars
kept something like a mile and a quarter in the
rear our watches got all out of time as we flew
westward so fast that we got clear ahead of the
sun the friction of the air took all the paint
off the outside of the cars and hats were sucked
up through the ventilators if you had dropped
a book it would not have touched the floor until
it had reached the back of the car while flies
were dashed against the rear end of the codch and
killed of course the people could not see the

train at all and were continually driving into
it at the crossings but they didnt know any
better before or afterward it was thought that
lightning struck them as they didnt know what
else it was and people along the line said th
train left a tunnel in the air which did not fill up
for half an hour while the air was hot from fric-
tion if you would foolishly point your finger
out of the window at anything it would be taken
off as slick as a knife by the solidified air we
went through a terrible rainstorm but not a drop
touched the train it didnt get a chance sev-

or two short

    the rear brakeman fell off the car but the suc-
tion kept him following right behind and they
reached out and pulled him in all right but quite

synopsis of previous chapters

richard robert jourdan md a stranger in new york takes up his residence with
mr and mrs phelan the former a police sergeant the doctor a young studiqus fellow has
a pet theory in regard to his profession which he has not been able to put into practise owing
to his poverty and obscurity he is instrumental in saving colonel nugent a western mining man
from an accident and later attends the colonel during his convalescence he confides his theory
to nugent and jourdan discovers that the colonel is acquainted with mr halliwell one of the rich
men of the city whose young son is a cleptomaniac a cure for this is part of jourdans scheme
and he secures a letter to the halliwells which results in an interview with the father and a meeting
with the daughter

chapter v

 the doctor explains

he dinner at the interstate
club took place in a private
room as most people know
the bulk of the members of
the interstate are men of af-
fairs and millions the ma-
jority are of ripe years every state in the
union is represented on the membership-
roll hence its name where money and
middle age are gathered there will be line
feeding and good drinking also it was so
in the case of the interstate club whose
dinners were famous and whose chef
owned his own home and a touring-car dr
jourdan came to the conclusion that evening
that he deserved every inch of his culinary
fariie

  nothing was said about the matter that
lay close to the hearts of the two men during
the serving of the courses but with the
coming of the coffee and cigars the host
signified to the attendants that he and his
guest wished to be alone

  well doctor have you anything addi-
tional to say to me asked the financier as
soon as the door closed

began in the april railroad mans



  the physician did not reply until he had
pondered over the query a little then he
said

   i think not mr halliwell i have tried
to tell you in lay language the theory and
method of effecting cures in cases allied with
that of your son there is hardly anything
more to be said so far as i am concerned
there remains however your consent or
your refusal

  the financier drummed on the table with
his fingers thoughtfully

  did i understand you to say the other
evening that you had witnessed or actually
performed cures by means of this system in
which you seem to place so much faith  

  dr jourdan made a gesture of assent

   have you any objection to relating some
of such  

  not in the slightest sir after a year
of bacteriological study in vienna i went
to florence taking with me letters of intro-
duction to professor lurattini of that city
he was then engaged in investigations hav-
ing to do with this same subject and it was
because of this that i went to him i was
under his tutelage over eighteen months
during that period i was privileged to see
him turn a man afflicted with homicidal
mania into a peaceful law-abiding citi-

the railroad mans magazine

zen a hypochondriac into a wholesome-
minded healthy individual while a noto-
rious brigand who came from a family of
professional robbers and cutthroats was
transformed into an honest hard-working
villager

    all by this seruni method 

   all by the injection of an appropriate
serum into the tissues of each patient he
was greatly aided in his work by the italian
government who not only allowed him to
select subjects from prisons and hospitals
but furnished him with those persons from
whose blood he wished to make serum-
cultures

   capital arrangement for the scientist
but rough on the other chaps laughed mr
halli well

   hardly so no person was operated on
one way or the other unless his consent was
first obtained in the case of the prisoners
certain privileges were allowed them in re-
turn for their acquiescence the patients
in the hospital were there to be cured and
they not only suffered no risks when in the
hands of a man like lurattini but they had
an excellent chance of recovery

  ah a chance of recovery echoed the
other

  my dear sir said dr jourdan earnest-
ly  medicine is not and never will be an
absolute science only those of its members
who are charlatans guarantee a cure in
every instance through a given course of
treatment no two human bodies are ex-
actly alike in a pathological sense where
the difference is marked the results of an
administration of a drug or a serum may in
each instance be of a contradictor nature

    speaking in general terms the specialist
is he who has learned to adopt a treatment
to a body the former being based on the
physical and mental idiosyncrasies of the
latter yet even the specialist is apt to err
in his diagnosis although in the majority
of cases the patient whom he treats has
as i have said an excellent chance of re-
covery

  then as i understand it a clever
physician should study-carefully study-
a new patient as a preliminary asked the
financier

    decidedly so

   and yet-if you will pardon my saying
so-you were ready to begin treatment on
my boy right away

  that is hardly correct mr halliwell
replied the physician emphatically  in

the first place the subject has not reached
that stage which would warrant my con-
templating treatment our talk relative to
your son has been of a tentative nature
only you have said nothing that i could
construe into a promise of consent even
had you expressed your willingness to place
him in mv hands i can assure you that i
should have made haste slowly i should
have subjected him to a proper period of
observation and investigation before going
further in the matter

  dr jourdan had a way of looking you
straight in the eye when he spoke and in
this instance there was something in his gaze
that matched the note of severe protest in
his talk

   it did not escape the notice of mr halli-
well like most very -ich men halliwell
was accustomed to defei -itial demeanor and
smooth speech from those with whom he
came in contact especially if they were look-
ing for business or social favors at his
hands

  it was a new experience therefore to
meet a man who talked to him fearlessly
and who didnt hesitate to contradict him
pointblank-politely it is true but direct-
ly nevertheless he liked the young doctor
all the more because of his independent at-
titude

  you are right dr jourdan he admit-
ted  i spoke hastily and i ask your par-
don for so doing but will you tell me about
other cases with which you came in con-
tact i wish to know more about this in-
teresting process

  the doctors face cleared like all fine-
natured men he didnt nurse the remem-
brance of an affront real or imagined

    certainly he said with a-smile  but
such cases were practically repetitions of
those that i witnessed in italy at buda-
pest a money-lender who had gone insane
on account of defaulting clients was re-
stored to health and sanity by professors
ruchman and arnauld the serum treatment
being used the money-lender was a no-
torious usurer who grew rich out of the
profligacy of young men of prospective
wealth after he left the asylum he closed
his business and endowed a home

   for the benefit of his old patrons i
presume said mr halliwell cynically

   it would seem that way in paris i
came in contact with two examples of the
effectiveness of the method although i did
not witness the phases of cures domon
dr jourdans mystery



mauroix and leveore were the physicians
in charge of the patients one of whom was
a nobleman who for many years had been a
notorious libertine he is living a monastic
life now

   in nantes and london i was afforded
further opportunities for passing on the
possibilities of the discovery

   on my return to this country i had the
great privilege of restoring to moral sanity
and his parents a young chicagoan who had
suddenly developed a mania for gambling
and was ruining himself in consequence

  have such cures proven permanent
asked the financier

    yes so far as i know was the answer
as i have stated germs breed diseases-
mental or physical-in accordance with their
type or species the germs once eliminated
from the system in both classes of maladies
there is but little chance of their return pro-
vided that precaution is taken against their
securing relodgment

  there was silence for a spell mr hal-
liwell consulted a small memorandum-
book which he drew from his vest-pocket

    dr jourdan he said at length  i am
aware that gentlemen of your profession ex-
ercise the right to surround your work with
a certain amount of reserve no doubt you
have good reasons for this therefore i am
not at all sure whether you will answer the
question im going to put to you

   if i can consistently answer i certain-
ly will

  well then why is my boy afflicted as
he is there must be some antecedent rea-
son for-for-his unhappy condition i
have put this question to several members
of your profession and none of them have
given me a satisfactory answer-either be-
cause they could not or would not can you
-or will you reply to it

chapter vi

getting down to facts

pr jourdan felt a sudden throb of
sympathy for the man whose millions
were useless to him in the presence of a
fathers affliction the huskiness of mr
halliwells voice told of the deep emotion
that underlay his speech

    ifyou really desire to learn what my be-
liefs are in regard to your sons case he
said very quietly  i can see no objection
to ygur so doing but i would remind you

   	rr

that these beliefs are not original with me
they form the basis of all the investigations
that are now being made by scientists on the
lines that i have indicated i have implicit
faith in them

   he paused

   proceed please mr halliwehs tone
bespoke his impatience

    it is proper for me to tell you though
that what i am about to state may not be al-
together pleasant i may offend you by my
frankness

    i hardly think so

   well then dr jourdan spoke slowly
arid distinctly a mental malady is not in-
frequently the outcome or the culmination
of an hereditary quality or trait developed to
an abnormal degree

   he halted again and the financier looked
at him inquiringly

    because of the interest that i felt in
your sons case he went on  i took it upon
myself to inquire into your family history
through the medium of genealogical works
of reference hoping that such inquiry would
furnish me with a clue to the young mans
affliction in this i was not disappointed

   i find that jabez halliwell landed in
this country from barnstaple england in
the early part of the eighteenth century and
established himself in new york first as a
general merchant later as an indian-trader
in those days the business was highly prof-
itable-for the trader indeed there were
not wanting those who declared that such
trading was sheer robbery jabez had two
sons hiram and seth seth went to mas-
sachusetts where he became a farmer and
trader and managed to exchange rum arid
gewgaws with the indians for considerable
of tiieir land

    his real-estate operations finally created
so much talk among the neighbors and trou-
ble among the aborigines that the authorities
interfered he proved his title to land in his
possession however and stuck to it although
he does not appear to have undertaken fur-
ther deals the new england branch of the
halliwells is now wealthy and socially influ-
ential  

   this last sentence was interrogative
the financier gave a nod of assent

    hiram remained with his father at
the death of the latter he succeeded to the
business in the meantime he had married
margaret dalton daughter of a ship cap-
tain and one son-named jabez for his
grandfather-was born to them now




the railroad mans magazine

whether it was through the influence of his
father-in-law or by reason of the tempting
profits of the business is not related but
anyhow hiram fitted out two if not three
ships for the slave trade all being under
the general command of captain dalton

  the venture proved profitable and the
flood of guineas that resulted brought many
things to hiram among them proffered mu-
nicipal honors these he declined possibly
on the score that he didnt want anything to
interfere with business

  during the first war with england he
appears to have converted his slavers into
privateers and although one of the ships
was destroyed he made money nevertheless
a  bloody flux  carried him off just after
the breaking of the nineteenth century and
new york acknowledged that it had lost one
of the most reputable and distinguished
citizens

  the family instinct for money-making
asserted itself in the case of young jabez
who took up the reins of the business he
bought new slavers fitted out several priva-
teers during the war with france and later
sold his ships outright to our government
just prior to the war of  he also
loaned money to the government officials at
a rate of interest that did more credit to his
business ability than to his patriotism the
tradition that he made big sums by selling
contraband supplies to the british does not
seem to be backed by sufficient evidence to
warrant its acceptance

  mr halliwell winced at this allusion to
an unpleasant episode in the family history
and the doctor continued

   your grandfather combined politics with
his commercial pursuits and to use the
vernacular played the combination for all
it was worth that his methods were fa-
vored was shown by the fact that he built
and endowed two churches and a hospital
it was also through his means that there was
a general betterment of the jail conditions
in the east

  the government commission that was
convened for the purpose of inquiring into
all his alleged unjustifiable acquirement of
what had been held as public lands in west-
ern pennsylvania cleared him of the original
charges of fraud and larceny

  again mr halliwell winced while the
doctor referred to a slip of paper that he
drew from his pocket

   your father mr halliwell like some
other shrewd men of means foresaw that

this country would speedily recover from the
industrial depression brought about by the
civil war and so proceeded to take ad-
vantage of the situation he purchased bank
and railroad stock real estate-and the con-
trol of certain commercial enterprises at the
then depreciated values and waited for the
inevitable boom

  if i mistake not he organized the pur-
chase and banking trust that bought for
cash securities of all kinds from the needy
at prices so small that the trust was finally
dissolved by reason of the outcry raised
against it by the press and the public the
gist of this cry was that the corporation was
trading in a cold-blooded fashion on the
desperate necessities of the community

he paused	

   am i not to be included in this-un-
varnished history of the halliwells asked
the financier with a wry smile

   i should serve no purpose by so inclu-
ding you what i have said will i think
illustrate my theory as to the cause of your
sons trouble

  and the theory is

   you have asked me to speak frankly
mr halliwell i am taking further ad-
vantage of your permission man is a preda-
tory animal his conquests over nature and
his fellows prove that much business is his
predatory instinct operating in more or less
legitimate fields

   in many cases the so-called successful
business man walks dangerously near the
boundary that separates the criminal from
the reputable classes where this is con-
tinued from generation to generation there
will come a time certainly when this hered-
itary trait will culminate in one or more of
his descendants giving it painful manifesta-
tion we have among other of such mani-
festations cleptomaniacs-those who have
no reason for stealing but who obey the
uncontrollable prompting left unto them by
predatory ancestors

  he spoke with the quiet solemnity of ab-
solute conviction	-

  then you hold that the sins of the fa-
thers will be visited unto  children of the
third and fourth generation  he asked

   in a sense yes but you should finish
the quotation  and show mercy unto thou-
sands of them that love me and keep my
commandments that to my mind is
equivalent to a promise that die cjrse can
be extinguished by the moral and physical
means at our command
dr jour dans mystery

  mr halliwell meditated the doctor
drew carefully at his cigar

    there is one aspect of your theory that
i cannot understand doctor- said mr hal-
liwell as he came out of his brown study
 and-if you will pardon my saying so-
it seems to me to be fatal to that theory it
is this on the one hand you tell me that-
that cleptomania and similar affections re-
sult from hereditary tendencies on the other
you assure me that they are due to germs
in the bodily system how do you reconcile
these apparently contradictory statements 
 the reply is not difficult i am glad
that you put the question to me

  dr jourdans tone was convincing he
continued

    as i have said a majority of the so-
called mental-or if the term be more prac-
tical moral-diseases are due to the pres-
ence in the system of the minute organisms
to which we give the name of germs mi-
crobes or bacilli they can only live and
multiply in a system whose condition is such
that it is favorable to them we have pre-
cisely the same proposition in other classes
of-diseases such as tuberculosis gout and
cancer to ase the lay phrase these dis-
eases  run in families  by reason of the
fact that infected ancestors are responsible
for a posterity whose powers of resistance
to the inroads of a given germ have been
weakened during the generations that pre-
ceded them and what is true in the case
of tuberculosis is equally true in the in-
stance of those subtler types of disease that
attack our morality through the medium of
our bodies

    the theory is at least ingenious com-
mented the other

    i think that the term  fact rather than
 theory would be more appropriate re-
torted dr jourdan with quiet emphasis
 inasmuch as its truth has been proven by
experiments

    doesnt it seem a little curious that a
discovery so tremendously important to man-
kind so far-reaching in its effects on this
and the generations that are to come should
be practically unknown to the world at
large and used only by a handful of special-
ists instead of the majority of medical
men asked mr halliwell

   yes-and no our profession is very
properly given to conservation it does not
readily indorse changes in its methods es-
pecially when these changes promise to be
of a radical sort as in this instance again

very special preparation for this treatment
is needed by the practitioner also facilities
that are not available in the case of the
average doctor

   the difficulties that surround the treat-
ment are such that it does not appeal to the
md who is given to easy self-exploitation
and it has not and will not receive that
cheap and misleading popularity that has
befallen many brilliant medical discoveries
during the early phases of their being

   upon my word doctor you seem to have
a satisfactory reply to every criticism of
your beliefs

   i am glad that you think them satis-
factory replied dr jourdan i speak
as i know

   have you any idea as to the time that
would elapse before we could look for an
improvement in our sons condition - if i
placed him in your hands asked mr
halliwell after another spell of meditation

  the young physician usually had him-
self well in hand but at the financiers
question charged as it was with possibili-
ties for which he had hoped and dreamed
for years the room seemed to spin around
him it was a moment or so before he could
reply

   i cannot say i must study him for a
little time there have been instances where
absolute cures were effected within a few
weeks in other cases many months elapsed
before a recovery was made i came in
personal contact with one patient in paris
who had been under treatment for nearly a
year and was only then on the road to
normality she was an american young
woman an only daughter of a western
packer who began life as cook in a cow-
camp the daughter and her millions mar-
ried an englishman of title he turned out
to be a very decent sort of a fellow who did
all in his power to further the social ambi-
tions of his wife which were many and con-
stantly increasing her mania for  smart-
ness  and her tuft-hunting propensities made
her socially notorious

   her cravings for further distinction of
the same kind dipped heavily into her mil-
lions and finally broke her health the
titled husband insisted on her going on the
continent for a rest while in grunewald
she met professor delence one of the fa-
thers of the new method the professor
diagnosed the wifes case as a form of exag-
gerated ego or a mental malady induced
and aggravated by her social ambitions


the railroad mans magazine

  with the assistance of the husband he
got her to paris and proceeded to treat her
i had a letter from him a few months ago
in which he tells me that his wife had set-
tled down into a quiet liome-loving wife
who is adored by the tenants of their estates
in somerset because of the way in which she
looks after their interests and lives so much
among them

   a most interesting case commented the
financier

   yes it illustrates a belief that i have
long held that an unreasoning desire for
social distinction-the cost not being count-
ed-is a true mental malady arising from
causes that are clearly traceable to the lives
of the idle rich

  the majority of our international mar-
riages especially when there is a title in-
volved -he checked himself cursing his
tongue for running away with his discre-
tion- but im wandering from the subject
in order to ventilate my views on a pet
topic

  he ceasej with a laugh that didnt have
much mirth in it

  well said mr halliwell with a slight
sigh  i am almost of the opinion that you
are right wholly or in part it may be that
a goodly portion of our larger ambitions are
based on a sort of insanity who knows
 great wit to madness -you know the quo-
tation  

  the doctor nodded but said nothing he
was still smarting under his unfortunate
remark

   and you are assured that no harm will
come to a patient through this treatment
even if he is not benefited thereby

  i am sure that is if the necessary pre-
cautions are taken by the physician in at-
tendance

   i dont think i need ask if these pre-
cautions would be observed if you had
charge of a case dr jourdan said mr
halliwell with a friendly smile  and-
i will place harold in your hands may
god prosper your work with him  

  thank you said the other with a sin-
cerity that carried with it the comfort of
conviction

  you do not mind if i ask some ques-
tions regarding your son queried the doc-
tor your replies will be of help to me
 ask anything you like said the other
earnestly  i shall be glad to answer you
the physician put a series of interro-
gations relative to the boys age habits edu-

cation companions tastes and he wanted a
minute answer to each query

    he is i take it conscious of regret after

 the act  

    yes

    has he ever told you that prior to the
act his conscience urges him not to yield to
the promptings of his weakness

   he has-on almost every occasion
when he is not quite himself in point
of health is the tendency to-to acquisition
more marked than at other times

   yes decidedly so

    is he especially attracted by articles
that are bright or glittering

  you speak as if you were entirely
familiar with his case it is as you say

    then let me tell you sir that his cure
is probable nay certain within a com-
paratively short time

  you speak positively dr jourdan
said mr halliwc-ll his eyes shining with-
hope

    in cases of this kind a patient invari-
ably responds to the treatment provided that
the obsession has not entirely destroyed or
ousted the moral sense in the latter in-
stance it las been found that no cure is
possible my allusion to the bright objects-
has to do with a peculiarity of the interme-
diate stages of the malady the victim is
in a sense in a condition of self-hypnosis
in accordance with a well-known law of
hypnotism anything that shines or glitters
induces this condition

    as to your fee began the financier
after the men had drunk a mute toast to
each other

    i would prefer that any remuneration
be deferred until your sons recovery in-
terrupted the doctor

   if-and pardon the suggestion-you
would like me to send you a check on ac-
count i shall be glad to do so i can quite
believe that the expenses incidental to the
treatment will be heavy

   no sir quite the contrary there is
no occasion tor me to call on your check-
book although i thank you nevertheless
as you like said mr halliwell who
to tell the truth was a trifle surprised at the
young doctors attitude in the matter in
view of his preceding experiences with
medical men and now what is the first
thing that you propose to do

    i want to have an opportunity to ob-
serve your son amid his usual surroundings
and under normal conditions i do not wish
dr jourdans mystery



him to know that he is to be treated by me
until i see fit to tell him the treatment
itself will be in accordance with what i
learn of his temperamental and other pecu-
liarities

    very well doctor a family dinner at
my home would serve your purpose

  nothing could be better if you talk
the arrangement over with other members
of your family be good enough to warn
them not to mention it to your son

    certainly the hope that you have given
us will prompt us to honor your wishes
god knows we want hope for our poor
boy 

  the physician was touched by the tone
even more than by the words it was one
of the first instances-although by no
means the last-in his professional career
that he was witness to the impotency of
vast wealth in the presence of a great sor-
row in such cases it always seemed to him
that human destiny was emphasizing the
futility of riches in the matter of those
things which are at the basis of true hap-
piness

  a clock chimed midnight bless me
cried mr halliwell  id no idea that it
was so late you have made me forget the
time doctor

    i appreciate the compliment the doc-
tor answered  but i think that it was the
topic- rather than myself that held your at-
tention

  the financier looked at his guest with
misty eyes

   you are right he said there was a
catch in his voice and if you are ever a
father dr jourdan you will understand
how my wife and myself feel about this
dear lad of ours in whom we have centered
so many hopes and so much love cure
him and i will- he stopped short

   and yet thought the doctor to him-
self  this man and woman are willing that
their daughter should purchase a title at the
bargain-counter of the altar then aloud 
you have my sincere sympathy mr hal-
liwell a parents first thought i naturally
for the well-being and future happiness of
his children

   that is as it should lie assented the
man of millions thoughtfully for the
second time that evening he sighed audibly
mr halliwell wasnt without troubles of
which the world knew nothing

   after arranging the dinner date the men
parted the hand-grasp that each gave

and received was significant of the good
understanding that the evening had brought
into being

chapter vii

 he halliwell hospitality

the colonels congratulations were of a
x breezy sort phelan on being taken
into the confidence of the texan and the
doctor shook the doctors hand until that
member tingled and ached prophesying that
the day would come when he larry would
be proud to tell that twas in his house that
the famous dr jourdan opened his first
office

  now phelan i want your help in this
matter began the md when the enthu-
siasm had subsided somewhat

   count me in on anything doctor im
yours

   i want you to put me in touch with two
or three professional crooks moll-buzzers
dips or hall-flams-but they must be old-
timers andhealthy

   the detective grinned at the use of  thief
slang for he had taught it to the doctor
himself

  that ill sure do he said the best
way will be to nail the guys the day that
they finish their bits in the jug for after a
five or seven-year stretch they are as clean
as a gun barrel the prison doctors see to
that

   do you think that there will be any
difficulty in getting them to submit to a
tapping  

  no that is if there is enough money
in it a crook who has been doing a
stretch doesnt as a rule find the glad hand
and the open wallet waiting for him out-
side the gates the yarns about his old
pals sticking to him and holding on to a
percentage of the  fall money  to shove into
his fist when lies turned loose are piffle

    hes usually busted except for his back
prison pay and he drifts into the old game
because hes got to keep body and soul to-
gether usually the square guys are the
last to help him along

  phelan spoke without irony he was
simply stating the condition as he knew it
existed

    all right ill rely on you phelan and
thanks for your help we neednt hesitate
to spend money to get the right people
anybody that you may select to watch out

in and out of the mill ever since he was
fourteen mostly for dipping which i
neednt tell you doctor is picking pockets

    curley simmons who finishes a seven-

he comes out on the eighth all choice and
lots more of them

  i leave the choice of the men to you
phelan whoever you may select i want
brought on to new york and put in quar-
ters where they can be under surveillance
until i have done with them

  leave all that to me doctor til see
you through this end of the proposition or
ill never draw a penny of pension

  a few evenings later when dr jourdan
alighted from a taxicab in front of the
halliwell mansion he felt that his self-
possession somehow or other had left him
this quality is the outcome of a belief in
ones self and ones ability to hold his own
in anything he may undertake it is a
curious fact however that the society of a
delightful young woman often breeds in a
young man an introspection that leads to
self-doubt that is in striking contrast to the
comfortable self-assurance that had pre-
viously been his and it was so in the case
of dr jourdan his discomfort was none
the less by reason of his realization that his
unwonted feelings were distinctly ridic-
ulous he had met miss halliwell but
once that she was as far removed from
him in a social sense as she well could be
was fully established in his mind in spite
of the promptings of his common-sense he
could not quite get control of himself when
he pressed the bell-button of the halliwell
front door something like a nervous shiver
swept through him from head to foot

  once inside the house however he be-
came his own master again and in the
drawing-room when he met and was intro-

duced to mrs halliwell and harold by
the financier a reaction set in that was in
direct contrast to his feelings of a few
moments before his fitness put him at his
ease forthwith and it was not long before
he was chatting with his host and the ladies
in pleasant fashion

  mrs halliwell was a tall and stately
woman with gray hair regular features
and a sweet but rather tired face she
had many of the earmarks of the typical
aristocrat in speech and bearing dr jour-
dan observed that while her manner toward
him was that of the cordial hostess it was
tinctured with a suggestion that he was
outside the rigid social pale that encircled
the halliwells

  it was not hard to see from which of her
parents mildred inherited her expression or
her carriage jourdan came to the conclu-
sion that the girl was a reproduction of her
mother as she must have been in the days
of her youth miss halliwell looked very
lovely in her dinner-gown and her greeting
to the guest was courteous and gracious

  harold was a good-looking lad who
strongly resembled his sister yet he lacked
that well-bred positiveness that was one of
her characteristics tall of fine carriage
and pleasant manners his personality was
winning yet his glance as the doctor
noted was wandering-even shifty when
his attention was not concentrated on an
object or topic his eyes swept around the
room as if in search of somethingsat other
times a film of vacancy seemed to pass
over his face and vision during the eve-
ning the doctor noted this with keen dis-
cernment

  when dinner was announced mrs halli-
well was escorted by the visitor the daugh-
ter by her father harold brought up the
rear dr jourdan inwardly resented the-
social canon that called for this arrange-
ment he had hoped that good fortune
would throw him with mildred as much as
possible

  dinner was served in the dining-room of
the mansion the tapestry and paneling of
which as all new yorkers know are deco-
ratively and socially famous the halli-
well plate was also in evidence and the
guest caught himself musing on the unex-
pected turn of the wheel of fate that had
placed in his hands a knife and fork whose
handles were griffins and violets of carven
silver and ivory

  what is commonly called society-
dr jourdaxs mystery



especially the women-live in a very small
world after all they mix with those that
are like unto themselves in most things
they seek the same amusements and they
eat the same food as do their neighbors
of  the avenue  they attend the same
churches and they are clothed and deco-
rated by the same tailors and dressmakers
and milliners even their fads are shared by
each other and the monotony of it all leads
to affairs with ladies of the stage so far as
men are concerned and elopements with
chauffeurs on the part of the women

  the halliwells were no exception to this
narrow rule of existence and dr jourdan
being otherwise than themselves came to be
duly appreciated before many courses were
served

  his breeziness and hearty relish of life
his original views of men and things and
the out-of-the-ordinary experiences that had
been his were in strong contrast to the blase
demeanor and conversation of the majority
of men that moved in the halliwell sphere
-and nobody noticed this more than miss
halliwell

  dr jourdan too could talk about him-
self and his doings without letting you feel
that he was making an undue use of the
first person singular-a gift greatly to be
desired he was familiar with the section
of england that had been mrs halliwells
home and he and she recalled some of the
traditions that clung around the ancient
church of st katherines-o-the-wynd of
the custom of  barring the bride  with
ropes of flowers held across the road which
bars were not lowered until there was a
scattering of flowers and small silver of
the annual blessing of the apple-trees and
other legends

  to harold he told a story or two of
cowboy life in texas for once on a time
as he explained he was bitten with the craze
for the rope and the bronco and wore it
out by a year or so of  punching

  and when miss halliwell turned the con-
versation on travel abroad he with a touch
of diffidence spoke of queer comers in the
slav states of a stay among the bedouins
in northern arabia and a marriage cere-
mony that he had witnessed in morocco

  you have traveled extensively and in
difficult places dr jourdan said miss
halliwell as he finished this last narration
and the smile that accompanied the remark
was very friendly the reserve that had at
first surrounded her gradually melted as the

dinner progressed and she joined in the
conversation with a zest that astonished and
delighted the young man

   well hardly that the facilities for
getting around nowadays are such that if a
man travels light he can go almost any-
where at short order and little discomfort
ou mean that he mustnt have a wife
and the trunks that go with her i suppose
said mildred with a rippling laugh

  the doctor echoed the laugh-as did the
others

    one must expect to be subject to the law
of compensation he retorted  perhaps it
is as well that it interferes in our doings in
order to prevent us becoming cloyed with
the good things of life

    do you allude to the wife or the travel  
asked mr halliwell mischievously

    i can only speak from the latter point
of view and again there was laughter

  the talk turned on the show places of
europe and dr jourdan confessed that he
was not jet familiar with them

   you must have had a reason for neg-
lecting them i imagine again i was
miss halliwell who spoke

    why i have admitted the doctor with
a show of reluctance  and im afraid
that youll think it a very stupid reason at
fiat

  that is interesting mother will you
please persuade dr jourdan to tell us why
he doesnt care for bonn or monaco or the
riviera or bournemouth

  as she asked the question dr jourdan
privately decided that her eyes never looked
lovelier than when lit with a spark of rail-
lery

    he will tell us without persuasion i am
sure came the modulated voice of mrs
halliwell will you not doctor

   if you wish me to til do so but youll
assuredly write me down a snob or a inisan-
trophe i warn you mrs halliwell

  and i shall follow mothers example
added mildred

   the doctor marveled all the more at the
manner in which she had shed the hauteur
that had enveloped her like a garment when
he saw her for the first time

   well then its because i dont like the
people that one usually meets at these points
for the most part they seem to be there
simply because the place is fashionable
their natural beauties seem to be absolutely
lost on this class of tourists i may be
cranky and possibly i am but vacuous chat-


the railroad mans magazine

ter and insipid personalities spoil my en-
joyment of an alpine peak or the purple
and gold and carmine of a mediterranean
sunset

  miss halliwell looked at her mother with
accusing eyes that sparkled over a smiling
mouth

    it is you that are responsible for most
of our trips to these places she said  and
it is you must clear our skirts of the impu-
tation of belonging to  the class of tourists 
to whom dr jourdan so strongly objects

   one moment please spoke up the doc-
tor i only alluded to the people one usu-
ally meets manifestly that does not in-
clude the members of this household

  adroit remarked mildred

   and truthful retorted the physician

  during this idle chatter dr jourdan was
not unmindful of the professional object of
his visit he observed harold closely and
the effect on the boy of the various phases
of the conversation he took mental notes
of his bearing of his conversation the way
that he responded to questions addressed to
him and the type of questions that he ad-
dressed to others

  while so doing on more than one occa-
sion he caught miss halliwells eyes study-
ing him as it were as if in an effort to
establish an estimate of him in such mo-
ments he had all his work cut out to main-
tain his equilibrium personal and profes-
sional

  toward the close of the dinner the doctor
felt that his object had been attained so far
as the lad was concerned he had ob-
tained that glimpse into his temperamental
condition that would warrant the formu-
lating of the treatment nothing remained
now but to administer it

  a sense of depression seized on him the
chances of future evenings like unto this
were over in die future his intercourse
with the family would be of a professional
nature only

   and how long have you been in prac-
tise doctor said mrs halliwell

  harold had left the room for the pur-
pose of fetching some photographs from his
den to show the guest

  less than a year madam but i have
studied medicine for a number of years in
this country and abroad

  since i have been the wife of mr hal-
liwell i have acquired a good deal of the
acquisitiveness that is charged against the
american woman she said the curves of

her pretty mouth vouching for the humor
that she felt  and so i am not going to
make any excuses for asking you whether
you are of english descent your pronun-
ciation of certain words suggests the ques-
tion

  yes i was born in england

  now i understand why you are so fa-
miliar with affairs on the other side of which
the average traveler has no knowledge by
the way i remember-that is i know of a
family of jourdans in leicester one of
them sir thomas jourdan a baronet by
the way was a famous physician if my
memory serves me aright he distinguished
himself in the army

  he was practically the father of mili-
tary diet and hygiene as we now know it-
that is so far as the british army is con-
cerned

  mrs halliwell turned and appeared to
be more interested

   ther you know of sir thomas evi-
dently  she asked

   he was my grandfather mrs halli-
well answered the doctor quietly

    bless me  ejaculated the lady startled
out of the reserve of her class while mildred
added  this is highly interesting and
mr halliwell jocularly remarked that his
wife would presently find diat the doctor
was a cousin many times removed

   sir thomas had one son i recollect
he of course was your father

  the doctor made a gesture of assent

    your grandfather died the year after my
marriage continued the lady  and then-
and then-

   our family affairs went wrong said
dr jourdan bluntly and father decided
to come to america mother died about
then but left him free to follow his in-
clinations he bought a ranch in the west
and did fairly well i inherited my inclina-
tion for medicine from my grandfather and
studied at intervals

  he paused and looked at mr halliwell
as if in appeal

   the financier answered the look

    i dont think dear he said to his wife
that we have the right to ask dr jourdan
for any more of his family history we-
i think father diat dr jourdan feels
that he is among friends who are not actu-
ated by anything but the kindliest of mo-
tives in listeninglo what he has to tell us
about himself said mildred halliwell
sweetly and there was that in her eyes that
dr jourdans mystery



made the young mans being thrill to its in-
most fibers

  your father must miss you greatly
ventured mrs halliwell after a pause

  the doctor bit his lip and controlled
himself with an effort

   i think not he said in a low tone
 he died seven years ago he was a good
man who is doubtless tasting the happi-
ness that awaits the good there are no
regrets or longings-there

  the emotion under which he labored was
unmistakable the eyes of miss halliwell
softened in a manner that was unusual to
them

   i have to ask your pardon for touching
on a topic that is as painful to you as this
must be said mrs halliwell presently
 and i am sure you believe that you have
all our good wishes for your future profes-
sional success

  there was a note in her voice that was
nott there previously dr jourdan did not
let it escape him it was as if the lady had
put him on the plane of an equal

  but-if i may ask-now that you have
succeeded to the title why do you not use
it i think it dates back some centuries
does it not 

  mrs halliwells voice was persuasive-
almost pleading excellent woman though
she was it had flashed on her that it would
be very pleasant for people to know that one
of the halliwell family physicians was sir
william jourdan

    it-the title-came into existence in the
time of the first james replied the doctor
 it is one of the oldest baronetcies in great
britain as to my reason for not using it
that is simple mrs halliwell i am an
american citizen in the first place and i
have a prejudice against a man making use
of a token of distinction that might have
been deserved by his ancestor but to which
he can lay no moral claim

    then you dont believe in titles  the
question came pertly from miss halliwell

   in countries in which they are custom-
ary they serve their purpose i suppose
in a republic such as this i cannot under-
stand the craving for them that exists in
some quarters i am merely voicing my
own opinion however i have no doubt
but that those who yearn for titular epaulets
can furnish good reason why they should be
worn but as a guarantee for the worth of
a man why i need not say that they are
often worse than useless

    yet it does seem a pity that you allow a
title that has so many admirable associa-
tions connected with it to lapse as it were
objected mrs halliwell

chapter viii

a telegram arrives

aflldred remained silent and her fa-
ther eyed dr jourdan attentively
both were thinking that the young doctor
was a person of an out-of-the-ordinary sort
-and both liked him none the less for be-
ing so

    i am not so sure that i intend to do so
he laughed  if the time ever comes that
i feel that i have done something that war-
rants the gratitude of the world i will sig-
nalize that time by budding out as a full-
fledged baronet up to that period how-
ever i shall remain a plain md

  thats a happy resolve declared mr
halliwell and upon my word doctor i
am with you 

   mrs halliwell raised her finely penciled
eyebrows in mute protest

   then for your own sake-and that of
the title-i hope it will not be long before
i may address you as sir william she said
brightly

  to which i add the hope that the re-
covery of your son will prove the first step
in the direction of my success

   the doctor spoke with an earnestness that
appealed to the mothers heart

  thank you she said simply from
that moment dr jourdan had established
himself in her regard

   mrs halliwell gave the signal for rising
 you can go with your mother in the
drawing-room said mr halliwell to ha-
rold who had returned in the meantime
 i want to speak to the doctor in the smo-
king-room

  as the ladies retired halliwell led the
way to the apartment sacred to the goddess
of nicotin

    well   he said as he motioned the doc-
tor to a chair and opened a cigar-cabinet

   the condition of your son is much as i
expected the formulation of the treatment
will after to-night be easy it only re-
mains to so administer it that it shall not
do violence to his temperamental peculiari-
ties the lad is of a highly sensitive nature
and will have to be carefully handled

  mr halliwell nodded
gg

the railroad mans magazine

  when can you begin the treatment
he asked

  in about ten days i shall then have
the serum ready and have made arrange-
ments for the needed supply

   then you have already taken steps to
that end   mr halliwells tone expressed
his approving surprise

    yes

   good and have you planned the meth-
ods that you are to use in connection with
the actual treatment

   in a way yes i propose-always pro-
vided that you give your consent-to try and
make your son look upon me as a friend in
the first instance and as a doctor in the
second if he can be induced to place con-
fidence in me in the former capacity i have
little doubt but that he will in the latter
a suggestion from me at this point that i
can cure him will free him from the nervous
objections that he might offer if i ap-
proached him as a medical man only and at
this juncture

    i think the plan a capital one but how
are you to go about it

  by asking him to share in some amuse-
ment or occupation that will appeal to his
taste does he use the gun  

   he did-some two or three years ago
but he sighed we have not thought it
well for him to mix in with our hunting
friends of late

  an acquaintance of mine has a little
place at buzzards bay he has been try-
ing to persuade me to run down and see him
and the ducks and bring somebody along
i think that his invitation is just the thing
in this connection

  will there be many in the party

  the meaning of the query was plain
enough to the physician and he hastened to
assure the other that the host the guests and
the guide would be all that would pull
trigger

   hutchinson-thats the name of my
friend-is a cranky sort of old chap he
is good as gold but soured by false friends
so he hangs out all by himself during the
gunning season and only flocks along with
a few people whom he believes he can trust
and harold will be welcome

    assuredly

    i hope that your kindness will cause you
no embarrassment said the financier with
some hesitation you understand what i
mean doctor

to be c

   perfectly and you need not fear that
your son will not benefit by the outing

  the men adjourned to the drawing-room
as he entered dr jourdan had an intuition
that the ladies had been talking about him
and that in a manner that was pleasant
being more free from egotism than the aver-
age young man he felt gratified but not
inflated

  harold was told of the proposed outing
and was highly delighted arrangements
were made and the doctor told the boy one
or two stories about crane roosts and fla-
mingo islands in louisiana and there was
some general conversation

  at length the evening ended

  good night sir william said miss
halliwell with that liquid laugh of hers i
am anticipating i know-but only for a lit-
tle while i hope

   i can almost forgive the title for the
sake of the hope replied the doctor

  so an evening ended that seemed fringed
with the hues of the rainbow

  harold and the doctor went to the hunt-
ing grounds two days later for a week they
had a gorgeous time at the hutchinson
quarters there was scooting and hanging
around in the sneak-boats and behind
blinds by day skating on smooth ice by
night-the moon being to the full-and
tales by amos the guide before the blazing
logs in the open fireplace of the bungalow

   these were tales of the times when whales
were plentiful off ammagansett and the
parts roundabout of marvelous flights of
ducks and geese of ling and frost-fish
running ashore in such quantities that the
beaches for miles were deep in them

  mr hutchinson came out of his shell of
reserve to relate hunting adventures in the
adirondacks and amid the swales and
sloughs of the dakotas and the doctor told
of hunting gazelles with arabs

  harold enjoyed himself hugely and on
only one occasion gave way to his weakness
for the healthy outdoor life seemed to react
for good on his mentality

  confidence in and regard for the phy-
sician grew with the lad dr jourdan felt
this and was exceeding glad in consequence
one day a telegram came from phelan
worded thus

   good people get out to-morrow what
about it the doctor knew that clever
thieves were to be let loose it behooved
him to act quickly

first fight for a railway

by felix g prentice

the ambitious efforts of the leading lawyers in the hearing before a com-
mittee of the house of commons in  to prevent the construction of
the manchester-liverpool railroad were only partly told in the first part
of this article published in our april number this month the continuation
of the cross-examination of george stephenson is presented showing other
ludicrous stumbling-blocks that were put in the path of progress by the emi-
nent attorneys who tried to prove that an engine  would slip backward while
going up a grade and forward while going down  that engines should be
provided with covers to keep the steam from escaping and that they would
never supersede the horse as common carriers

     try to penetrate the mind of mr stephenson in those days harrassed
and burdened by such opposition knowing as he did that he was starting civ-
ilization on a new era but for his confidence in his work and his unshaken
faith in humanity the progress of railroading would have been materially
retarded	

they didnt want the engine to run because it might frighten horses
and then the passing train would cut off a
view of the valley

part ii

akc r stephenson was then

examined on a point that
i jbwwt  - seemed to have been con-
idgtmsidered of great impor-
tance namely the effect of
locomotives on horses the
following amusing dialogue took place

q are they formidable to horses
a no more than a mail-coach not so
much

q  i suppose there are some horses
which will shy at a mail-coach a i
have seen the mare which this gentleman
rode shy at a mail-coach

 was it your own horse a it
was

q  i really thought it was a canal-
horse a a canal-gentleman rode it

  q  there are some horses that will shy
at anything for that is what it coines to
a yes i can only say that there is a
good deal of the mule in this particular
horse

  q was it one of those horses that will
put its head into a hedge or a ditch if it
meets anything  a yes something of
that sort

  q it would shy at anything a
yes it would at a wheelbarrow

  q -joking apart do you conceive that
a well-broken horse would face one of the
engines a it would i have seen a
well-bred horse come close up to one

  in answer to other questions mr stephen-
son said that horses at plow in the fields
took  notice of the engines he had never


the railroad mans magazin

heard the farmers complain and the horses
that he spoke of were neither blind nor deaf
but in full possession of their senses

  he considered it would be quite practi-
cable to build an engine that would haul
thirty tons at the rate of eight miles an
hour and he had no doubt they might go
at the rate of twelve miles

  momentum at twelve miles an hour

  at this point the formidable mr alder-
son rose and cross-examined stephenson
the cross-examination was long and tedious
it was confined at first chiefly to the ques-
tion of slipping referred to in mr alder-
sons summing up the chief part of the
examination with regard to speed was as
follows

  q what would be the momentum of
a body of forty tons moving at the rate of
twelve miles an hour a it would be
very great

  q  have you seen a railroad that would
stand that a yes

  q where a any railroad that
would bear going four miles an hour i
mean to say that if it would bear the weight
at four miles an hour it would bear it at
twelve

  q taking it at four miles an hour do
you mean to say that it would not require
a stronger railway to carry the same weight
twelve miles an hour a i will give
an answer to that any man who has
skated  ice knows that the faster he goes
the better the ice will hold his weight
when a train travels quickly the weight in
a measure ceases

  q  is not that upon the hypothesis that
the railroad is perfect - it is and i
mean to make it perfect

  q  i ask you whether if one rail were
to be out of its place a quarter or a half an
inch whether that would not produce a com-
plete negative to your proposition sup-
pose one of the rails were to slip aside
 they cannot slip aside if they are
properly constructed

load would not overturn

  the committee then took up the exami-
nation in answer to their questions mr
stephenson said that if the engine were
upset while going at the rate of nine miles
an hour with a heavy load behind the load
would not be overturned the engine might

suddenly stop by a break upon the wheels
which would disengage the weight behind
instantly so that going at the rate of nine
miles an hour everything would be safe on
a sudden stop the wagons and engine
could be made to stop at the same instant
this was done by means of a lever connected
with all the wagons and the engine

  the next witness examined was mr
nicholas wood the manager of the killing-
worth colliery on the railroad of which the
experiments detailed by mr rastrick were
made the total length of the railroad was
-i miles it had been laid down for about
twenty years it was designed originally
to be worked by horses but in s loco-
motive engines were first used 

  the number of engines that had been
employed on the road were four they were
all made by mr stephenson and were each
of the power of eight horses the number
of wagons attached to each engine varied
from nine to twelve - each wagon taking
fifty-three hundredweight of coals

  a good practical load for one of these
engines is ten loaded wagons which with
the weight of the engine and tender total a
weight of forty-nine tons an engine with
four-foot wheels could travel with this load
at the rate of six miles an hour or a little
more occasionally with three-foot wheels
it could make between four and five miles
an hour

more questions regarding speed

  a rate of three miles an hour will how-
ever be sufficient for the purposes of the
coal work the only use made of tlje rail-
road being to convey coals from the mine to
the seashore the greatest inclination in
the road was  in  the only accident
that happened to the engines was the giving
way of the fire tube by which one man was
scalded

  mr wood was then questioned

  q  have you any doubt that a loco-
motive could be made to take the weight of
forty tons at the rate of six miles an hour
with perfect safety a an engine may
go six miles an hour with forty tons-that
is including the weight of the carriages

  q  have you any doubt that the power
of the engine might be so increased as to
take that weight at any speed between six
and twelve miles an hour  i think
the power of the engine may be increased to
take that weight
-v- l 

       v

first fight for a railway



   q to what extent do you conceive the
power of the engine could be increased to
take that weight of goods a i can
scarcely state that to you the power of
the engine may be increased very greatly
q  as much as double a i think
it might

   q  if you had such an engine in your
opinion could it be made to go with perfect
safety twelve miles an hour with relation
to the bursting of the boiler a yes i
think it might

   q at the rate you go at killingworth
are the engines easily managed and easily
stopped a very easily

cost of construction

   q  is their pace easily slackened  
a yes

  q  easily started again a yes
 q  in short they are easily manage-
able a they are

  q  do you think they could be made
perfectly manageable to go at the rate of
eight miles an hour a yes i con-
ceive they might at eight miles an hour
mr stephenson who had made an esti-
mate of the total cost of the construction
then submitted his estimate he said that
a bridge across the irwell river one hun-
dred feet would cost  provided it
had but one span the counsel for the op-
position objected most strenuously to such
a bridge claiming that it would probably
stop up the river the counsel also seemed
to entertain the idea that in a snow-storm
a tunnel would fill up and mr stephenson
was questioned on the subject

   q  what sort of effect would snow have
upon the tunnel at the entrance  a  part
of it would get in but it would depend in
a great measure on the wind

   q  but would it not fall into this great
tube a if the wind blew longitudi-
nally it would get the same quantity of
snow in that part as would fall on the ad-
joining ground but if it blew a gale at
right angles it might then drift in more
than the adjoining ground

  q did you ever go up dunstable
hill a yes i did

  q in the year s the time of the
great snow a yes

  - supposing that to be the case
a  i could not calculate more than once
in twenty years that such an effect would be
produced

   q- do you not know that if the snow is
lying upon the ground and the wind blow-
ing transversely the tunnel will fill
a no it must be a very long storm to
fill it

   q would it not have a tendency to fill
it a that depends upon the state of
the wind

   q  suppose the wind to be transverse
and the snow lying upon the ground what
will there be to take the snow out when it
has once filled the tunnel it will then be
out of the wind a  it will fall there
q and there it will accumulate
a yes

  q  by what means is it to be taken
out a  you could not throw it out at
the top very well but i will throw it out at
the two ends

  it was not till near the close of the
seventeenth day after he had been more
than three days under examination that
the questioning of george stephenson was
concluded

  on the twentieth day mr harrison
opened the case on behalf of some land-
owners on the proposed line his speech
was an elaborate and minute analysis of
the evidence in which he labored to show
that the delays in the transit of goods from
liverpool to manchester were exceptional
that the railway company wanted a monop-
oly more stringent than that possessed by
the canals that the experiments with loco-
motive engines had not been fairly made
and that the scheme of the railroad was
crude imperfect and unsatisfactory of
mr stephenson he said

didnt understand stephenson

   i declare solemnly after i read his
evidence through i could not understand
it he speaks of an embankment in one
place and of a level in another and a
cutting in a third i will prove that it is
impossible to lay the railroad across here
unless he raises it nineteen feet above the
level which he has contemplated unless he
carries it up to the top of those intersecting
roads

   if he does not in every flood that
comes into the irwell river this railroad
for one mile will be very often six feet
under water he must raise it to the
height i have stated therefore up to this
moment in what situation do i stand

 i am not enabled to say what this en-
g

the railroad mans magazine

gineer means to do and i cannot point out
the injury that may be done except that
our engineers say there must be a great
embankment which must cover a large
quantity of land and which will interrupt
the communications between the different
parts of the property and cut off the road
from liverpool to manchester

   i am met here by the intervention of
the section which gives no information to
any person and i am only to be let into
such parts of the case as the engineer will
explain which are very few

  unless therefore all the principles
which the british legislators act upon are
lost sight of this committee i am con-
vinced will see that it cannot act on the
evidence of this man for he has not made
up his mind how lie shall carry into execu-
tion a great part of this project

  with regard to the powers of the loco-
motive engine he expressed himself thusly

   when we set out with the original
prospectus we were to gallop i know not
at what rate i believe it was at the rate
of twelve miles an hour my learned
friend mr adam contemplated possibly
in alluding to ireland that some of the
irish members would arrive in the wagons
to a division

   my learned friend says that they would
go at the rate of twelve miles an hour
with the aid of the devil in the form of a
locomotive sitting as postilion upon the
forehorse and an honorable member whom
i do not now see here sitting behind him
to stir up the fire and to keep it up at full
speed

cant keep up with canal

   but the speed at which those locomo-
tive engines are to go has slackened mr
adam does not go faster now than five
miles an hour the learned sergeant says
he should like to have seven but he would
be content to go six

  i will show that he cannot go six
and probably for practical purposes i
may be able to show that i can keep up
with him by the canal

  now the real evidence to which alone
you can pay attention shows that practi-
cally for useful purposes and to keep up
the rate of speed continually they may go
at something more than four miles an
hour

 in one of the collieries there is a small

engine with wheels four feet in diameter
because in an experiment or two they may
have been driven at the rate of six that
that is the average rate at which they can
carry goods upon a railroad for the pur-
poses of commerce for that is the point
to which the committee ought to direct
their attention and to which the evidence
is to be applied

   it is quite idle to suppose that an ex-
periment made to ascertain the speed when
the power is worked up to the greatest ex-
tent can afford a fair criterion of what
an engine will do in all conditions of
weather

  engine couldnt stand damp weather

   in the first place locomotive engines
are liable to be affected by the weather
you are told that they are affected by rain
and an attempt has been made to pover
them but the wind will affect them and
any gale of wind which would affect die
traffic on the mersey river would render
it impossible to set off a locomotive engine
either by poking the fire or keeping up the
pressure of steam till die boiler is ready
to burst

  a scientific person happened to see a
locomotive coming down an inclined plane
with a tolerable weight behind it and he
found that the strokes were reduced from
fifty to twelve as soon as the wind acted
upon it therefore every gale that would
produce an interruption to the intercourse
of the canals would prevent the progress of
a locomotive engine so that they have no
advantage in that respect

  on the twenty-first and twenty-second
days witnesses were examined as to die
effect the railroad would have on the prop-
erty of the landowners one of these wit-
nesses had never seen a locomotive engine
engineers were then called to prove that
mr stephenson was all wrong one of
these mr giles said speaking of chat
moss

would go to the bottom

   in my judgment a railroad of this
description certainly cannot be safely made
over chat moss without going to the bot-
tom of the moss it will be necessary
therefore in making a railroad which is to
stand to excavate along the entire line of
road through the moss down to thirty-three
first fight for a railway



or thirty-four feet and afterward to fill it
up to a height level with the banks of
the moss

  if mr stephenson be right in placing
the level of the railroad fifteen feet below
the moss the ywould not only have to
cut out thirty-four but to build up the
other fifteen feet and unless that were
done i do not think that a railroad would
stand 

  my estimate for the whole cutting
and embanking over chat moss is nearly


  no engineer in his senses would go
through chat moss if he wanted to make
a railroad from liverpool to manchester
this witness estimated the cost of the
line proposed by mr stephenson at a mil-
lion and a half he was the projector of
a new canal between liverpool and man-
chester of which he said

   the description of boat which the
canal would accommodate would be a
small active running boat-a pretty little
running fly - boat that would run about
four or five miles an hour it will per-
form the trip in a much less time than a
train as i can make my canal thirty-five
or thirty-six miles from liverpool to man-
chester without obstruction of tideway

   the small boats would be able to
travel their distance in nine or twelve
hours i suppose we should want a mil-
lion of money but i will not finally esti-
mate it until i have carefully tried the
foundation of the mersey

  another witness mr palmer went into
an elaborate statement founded on many
experiments to show the advantage of rail-
roads and canals he claimed that at a
speed of four miles and a quarter or un-
der the advantage was in favor of canals
above that the advantage was on the side
of the railroad

the  ignorance  of stephenson

  on the twenty-sixth day mr alderson
made a long speech in summing up of
mr stephenson he said

  i say he never had a plan i believe
he never had one i do not believe he is
capable of making one his is a mind
perpetually fluctuating between opposite
difficulties he neither knows whether he
is to make bridges over roads or rivers or
of one size or another or to make embank-
ments cuttings or inclined planes or in

what way the thing is to be carried into
effect

   in the first place stephenson answered
me very curtly the first day  i shall cut
my moss at forty-five degrees it will stand
at that very well be it so i am content
with the answer  of course i said  you
will drain your road on each side i
shall make ditches  how wide are they
to be   six feet  how deep   oh
they are to be five feet deep or four feet
deep

   now i am sure the committee are well
aware that a ditch if ever it is to come
to a point at the bottom and is to be five
feet deep cut an angle of forty-five degrees
on each side must be ten feet wide at the
top

   what do you think of the ignorance of
this gentleman who chooses to have an im-
possible ditch which he wants to cut by
the side of an impossible railway did
you ever hear such ignorance

   whatever credit you might have been
disposed to give mr stephenson before it
is plainly shown now how utterly and to-
tally devoid he is of common sense for
every one who knows that two and two
make four would have known that that was
an impossible ditch

his foolish schemes

   but he does not stop there when we
come to inquire how knowsley moss is to
be got over he stated first that he was to
have a channel for the brooks i suggested
to him that there were two brooks which
run across the deep cutting of eighty feet
and i wanted to know how he was to get
them from one side to the other

   he never had thought of them he
said in the first instance he would make
a channel by the side of the railway how
was the channel to be made  i do not
know how long will it be would
it not be a mile  which of course would
increase the expense

   no says he  i do not think a mile
but suspecting he might be wrong there
he said  then i will make a tunnel

   i cannot bind him to any one point
this is the gentleman who is called to
prove the estimate and the plan he can-
not prove it he makes schemes without
seeing the difficulties and when the diffi-
culties -are pointed out then he starts other
schemes which are exposed to ridicule


i

f

the railroad mans magazine

   having said that he was to make a
tunnel he is asked how long that tunnel
is to be and he cannot tell whether it is
one thousand yards or one hundred if he
had not known whether it should be one
hundred or one hundred and fifty yards
i should not have said anything about it
but how great is his variance and this
through a moss where there is to be a cut-
ting eighty feet deep he admits it is
material in order to make a tunnel to
know the strata

  now let us see what happens next
he says he has made no borings to ascer-
tain the strata and therefore by his own
rule he cannot make an estimate his
own evidence is that he cannot make one

he could not estimate

  then the committee is to say i sup-
pose  oh it is not material there should
be an estimate we will make one for our-
selves and though this gentleman on
whom we are to rely cannot make any esti-
mate we do not care we will pass the bill
-estimate or no estimate plan or no plan
right or wrong the bill shall pass

  my learned friends will not avow this
but the facts of the case avow it having
got rid of that mr stephenson next says
 i will not make it a thousand yards long
i will make it part tunnel and part open

   that is the third scheme then he
says  i will not cut or make any tunnel
but we will make inclined planes we now
have not fewer than four or five different
schemes to cross one moss here are five
schemes from which he is successively
driven what then are you going to
vote for

   mr stephenson has produced five
schemes all resulting in one estimate for
whether they are cuts or channels or tun-
nels or planes there is the same sum of
 on which he retreats if he had to
cut several million more yards he has still
the  to retreat upon

   that will be all expended long before
he gets to chat moss but even supposing
he struggles through with this  about
his neck what is to become of knowsley
moss whether it is to have cutting or tun-
nel or a part cutting and part tunnel or
inclined planes no person knows to this very
day including mr stephenson himself

   again the first day he chose to have
planes at irwell bridge  i will not says

he  have embankments however high the
bridge may be  how then will you get
over it  i will make two inclined planes
and the wagons will be wound up by a sort
of crank -

   i asked him this question  will you
stick to that plan   in a rash hour he said
 i will

   he was contented to stick to that plan

  twenty-four hours had not elapsed be-
fore he went back on it for when i was
going to ask him the question the next day
with another object an honorable member
interposed and said  you asked him that
question before and almost before the
words were out of his mouth it popped out
that he had discovered that embankments
might be made

   mr stephenson has given no direct evi-
dence nothing to which he will bind him-
self nothing to which he will stick and yet
it is upon his evidence that you are called
upon to pass this bill

  the lawyer then entered into an argu-
ment to show that a solid railway only was
practical through chat moss and that many
of mr stephensons calculations were en-
tirely wrong

   i think you must come to the conclusion
that the advantages of the railroad are ex-
tremely doubtful and problematical he
said and if we are so circumstanced i
say that you will and ought to entitle me to
your consideration

   despotism  of the liverpool exchange

  if you must have a mere convenience
for carrying cotton at the rate of twelve
miles an hour which now goes at the rate
of three then i protest against the despot-
ism of the liverpool exchange striding
across the land of this country i protest
against a measure like this supported by
such evidence and founded upon such cal-
culations

  mr parke then opened the case of charles
orrell and sir william gerrard against the
bill a summary of his address shows the
nature of the early opposition of land-own-
ers to railroads

  mr orrell a gentleman of respectable
family and considerable property complains
of the intended railway as injurious both to
his estate and residence sir william ger-
rard the heir of a very ancient family in
lancashire complains of the railways not
as affecting his residence but as affecting
first fight for a railway



his estate upon which there are valuable
collieries

  when the grievances of which his clients
complain are enumerated in addition to
those which have been pointed out in the
other land-owners cases the committee can-
not pass the bill

   it is a principle invariably adhered to
by parliament that private property is not
to be invaded unless there be urgent public
necessity mr orrell is the lord of the ma-
nor of parr and he and his ancestors have
resided in their mansion upward of a cen-
tury considerable sums have been spent in
improving the property with a view to mr
orrells continued residence there if the
railway is not constructed

injury  to his residence

   the proposed railroad will pass within
two hundred and fifty yards of the mansion
and subject it to the nuisance arising from
the constant passage of noisy and smoky
engines by a clause in the bill it may be
brought to within one hundred and fifty
yards of the front of the house can any-
thing compensate a gentleman for such an
injury to his residence and estate which
have long been in the possession of the
family 

   mr stephensons plans are so inaccu-
rate that the precise extent of the injury- to
this property cannot be ascertained neither
the height of the embankments nor the depth
of the cuttings can be known

   in some parts of mr orrells estate there
will be embankments of the height of eight-
een feet above the surface of the ground
across the valley through which the sankey
river runs there will be an embankment
fifty feet high which will entirely destroy
mr orrells view of the valley beyond the
line of the proposed railroad

   in the case of the tees and weardale
railway the bill was lost because the line
of railway passed at the distance of half a
mile from a gentlemans residence while in
the present case it is proposed to bring the
railroad within two hundred and fifty yards
of the petitioners residence

the coal under the tracks

  there are also other injuries of which
the petitioners complain mr orrell is the
proprietor of valuable coal-mines which the
provisions of the bill will entirely prevent

   	r r

him from working the railroad company
are only to pay for the surface of die
ground and the proprietor of the colliery
is to receive no compensation for the value
of the coal which he will be obliged to leave
under the railroad

  mr orrells and sir william gerrards
coal properties lie near the surface and it
will be necessary to leave a barrier to the
extent of forty yards on each side of the
railroad beside that which is immediately
under the railroad

   but that is not all it is proposed that
mr orrell and sir william gerrard shall
not be permitted to construct any additional
drifts or cuts or other works under the rail-
road in consequence of which the commu-
nication between the different parts of their
respective collieries will be entirely inter-
rupted and the consequence will be of great
inconvenience and loss

opposing the locomotive

  on the twenty-ninth day the case of the
trustees of the duke of bridgewater was
opened by mr macdonnell and a number
of witnesses were subsequently called to
support it the cases of the proprietors of
the irwell and mersey navigation and of
the leeds and liverpool canal concluded
the opposition to the bill

  the leading features of the opposition of
the three parties who collectively represent-
ed the canal interest will be best gathered
from the speech of mr harrison who
summed up the case in their favor

   i now come to comment upon the loco-
motive engines i entreat the committee to
recollect how this project has arisen i will
ask every honorable member whether any
human being would have thought of setting
up a railway between liverpool and man-
chester if that railway were to be conducted
by horses

   i say it never entered into the imagi-
nation of any one  but amid all this ma-
nia that has possessed us-for we have been
running mad after projects and schemes of
all sorts and descriptions-locomotive en-
gines have been patronized and supported
by some people for the purposes of showing
their ingenuity in writing essays and pam-
phlets and by others for the purpose of ber
ing employed as engineers or otherwise

   to make the thing popular not only do
certain ingenious gentlemen write pam-
phlets but some have written books and


the railroad mans magazine

we have not only books and pamphlets and
essays without number but we have beau-
tiful pictorial exhibitions of locomotive en-
gines at full work one of which is now ly-
ing before me

  one ingenious gentleman has a beau-
tiful impression of a locomotive engine
with carriages and guards standing behind
them giving a description of seven or eight
stage-coaches with trumpeters and guards
and all the paraphernalia galloping on at a
rate of several miles an hour

   whether such speed ever will be made
i do not know but i think when i come to
comment upon that part of the case many
persons who have thought these prints very
beautiftil things will be sick of the experi-
ment

  the project of this railway was entire-
ly founded upon the locomotive engines it
was set on foot with a view to the expedi-
tion which would be derived from the use
of them all the pamphlets published
about it give us twelve miles an hour as
the rate at which they were to go

fast as mail-coaches

   you were to gallop from liverpool to
manchester at the rate at which the mail-
coaches have tried to go but never accom-
plished

  this expedition was to produce such
consequences with reference to the trade of
the two places as almost to unite them in
one so quick would be the change of the
bags of cotton and other articles all this
in the natural order of things produced
subscribers it gave rise to all sorts of ca-
lumnious and untrue assertions in pam-
phlets and publications without end against
the existing establishments

   i have a right to state-for no attempt
has been made to prove them - that the
alleged facts are utterly false that the per-
sonalities which are of the worst descrip-
tion have no foundation but in the mis-
representations of self-interested partiet

   all these promises of locomotives run-
ning at the impossible speed of twelve
miles an hour will be surely blasted you
will find that six will be the limit

  yesterday and to-day we find in the
best weather and under the most favorable
circumstances the expedition is diminished
to four or five and whenever you come to
rain or mizzling weather or dampness it is
reduced to two and three miles an hour

  is lancashire a county free from rain
have you no mizzling weather no snow
there i should rather suspect-and i do
not mean to calumniate the county of lan-
caster-that it is a county which has as
much rain as any other county on that side
of england

   unless they can rarefy the atmosphere
as quickly as the locomotive engines go
along the locomotive engine will have so
many inconveniences to contend with that
it will come down to the speed of a com-
mon horse

  water tracks to prove moisture effect

  now i ask would any person step for-
ward to support this measure if the goods
were to be drawn by horses but not con-
tent with goods they are to take passengers
now set them off with horses before them
set the proprietors of the railway traveling
on their own road from liverpool to man-
chester in wagons at the rate of four miles
and a half per hour it is impossible to state
it without presenting something ludicrous to
the mind

  the committee will recollect that we
had two or three witnesses to speak for the
locomotive engines we had mr rastrick
a man very scientific experimental and
well grounded in all the subjects on which
he spoke but he told you that he had never
seen a locomotive engine in practise and i
showed that in that very experiment he
ought to have gone further than he did in
order to have ascertained the effect which
rain might have produced

   for instance he might have watered the
railroad to see what effect moisture would
have had if mr rastrick had tried the
experiment as a man of science i have not
the least doubt but that he must have ar-
rived at a conclusion that locomotive engines
are utterly useless for the purpose my
learned friends wish you to believe they are

   but mr rastrick knew that if this bill
succeeded he would make engines for a line
of railroad of not less than forty-four miles
and by the time the railroads were in run-
ning order the poor gulled subscribers
would have found that they had lost all their
money instead as they hoped of putting a
good deal into their pockets instead of
locomotive engines the must have recourse
to horses or asses - not meaning to say
which

   mr rastrick never attended to more
first fight for a railway



than one experiment of any consequence
then he found that there was a considerable
difference in the strokes of the piston was
he not bound to investigate from what cause
it arose and to see what effect was produced
by a careful examination of all circum-
stances which could produce any effect upon
the engine 

  if a man mean to arrive at a true con-
clusion every circumstance affecting the
power of the engine should have been made
the subject of careful investigation what
the effect is you have heard from himself
after he tried the experiment and saw the
result he never tried it again

  he felt that he had got into difficulty
he satisfies himself therefore with puttiry
half a dozen people in the wagon then start-
ing the engine he finds that it goes at a
certain rate he wishes to lead you to the
conclusion that an average speed of five or
six miles an hour is to be obtained by these
engines so as to make them available as a
means of conveyance

  i saidbefore and i repeat it again that
any practical result which will enable you
to arrive at a conclusion is worth all the
reasoning and all the experiments of any
man however scientific he may be

   scientific calculations are necessarily
mixed up with so many uncertainties as to
render it impossible for any man to say that
you can positively arrive at a conclusion
but you cannot be deceived when after sev-
eral years service those engines can never
exceed four miles and a half an hour

solid stee

the steel wheel is as logical a successor to the
cast-iron wheel as steel rails and ties are
to the old iron and wooden construction the
heavy loads which freight-cars are now built to
carry demand a substitute for cast-iron wheels
and as this is distinctly a steel age the natural
thing to do was to look to this material which
possesses all the ncccssary attributes to meet the
situation that there is a limit to the utility
of cast-iron vheels was the realization which
came with the more powerful locomotives and
consequently heavier tenders which became neces-
sary to haul the gradually increasing train loads
the demand for a stronger wheel was first met
in this class of service by the steel-tired wheel
and as the demands upon wheels in other classes
of service have increased the field of the steel-
tired wheel has broadened until it is now com-
mon under passenger-train cars as well it has
never become common however under freight-
equipmcnt on account of its lextremely high cost

  to be sure there was an engine with a
small weight that went at a greater rate but
that was not the ordinary rate and that was
the one on which they made the experiment

   then sir what is the situation in which
we stand i show that locomotive engines
cannot move at more than four and a quar-
ter miles an hour at which you are reduced
to horse-power and below that the canal has
the advantage therefore the instant they
lose the power of going above four and a
quarter miles an hour which i have taken
from them that instant the advantage is in
favor of the canal

   instead of their having an advantage in
bringing forward the railroad the power
stands with us their scheme is based on
deception and fallacy they are fighting
for no public improvement whatever it is
impossible after the evidence which has
been gone through that my learned friends
can ask of the committee to give their sanc-
tion to this bill

  the wrangling of the lawyers lasted for
thirty-eight days finally notwithstanding
the opposition that became more ludicrous
as the days wore on parliament empow-
ered the company  to make a railway from
liverpool to manchester

  how childish and puerile the obstacles
that were raised to prevent the building of
this road seem in the advanced and enlight-
ened atmosphere of to-day what would
such men say were they to return to earth
and witness the outcome of the genius of
george stephenson and richard trevithick

l wheels

the absolute necessity of finding a wheel for
freight service with the strength and wearing
qualities of a steel-tired wheel but at the same
time less expensive is therefore the real reason
for the existence of solid steel wheels to-day
now that the solid wheel is here it is gaining
a place not only under freight-cars but in all
exacting classes of service the only possible
objection to the substitution of the steel wheel
for cast-iron in freight service is its initial cost
which is perhaps three to five times that of a
cast-iron wheel but in these modern days of
exact accounting and careful investigation of costs
over a sufficiently long period to demonstrate
ultimate value even this objection is sure to be
either altogether removed or very greatly dis-
counted furthermore in weighing the cost of
cast-iron wheels against that of steel wheels the
item of loss resulting from wrecks due to broken
flanges should not be lost-american engineer

honk and horace

           by emmet f harte

          their return to valhalla in the hills is
          attended by shooting irons and a band

for a raise instead of resigning and let them
fire me

  i suggested that they get some good whit-
tler to whittle out a wooden figure which
they could set up inside the depot window
to act as station-agent should my quitting
demoralize the service

  a dummy no doubt could have transact-
ed all the business at wakickewa very read-
ily-but when the div supe himself wired
and wanted me to explain the plan more
fully by letter of course i gave up in
despair

there wasnt any particular reason why
honk should stick around tiose two weeks
though i told him to pike on ahead and
take charge at valhalla leaving me to fol-
low him as soon as i could but he abso-
lutely refused to go without my sturdy form
plodding by his side

well make our triumphal entry side
by each he proclaimed  it was all right

he  powers  required at least
two weeks notice before theyd
consent to my throwing up that
famous lazy mans job at the
wakickewa station they said
it would take that much time
to rearrange the men along the linelifter
selecting my distinguished successor i had
no idea my resignation was going to upset

tp leave em sort of on the instalment plan
by degrees but when we go back my boy
we want to go in state

  we ought to have our new car and de-
scend on the town with an eye to the dra-
matic effect with a fanfare of trumpets and
the flutter of flags

    itll take about two weeks at the shops
for them to get the new medicine-house in
shape then horace - ah say well
have em resurrecting that old  back from
elba  joke

  wfiile we were waiting those two weeks
honk amused himself by sending messages
to our friend willie the president of the
transcontinental and packing and un-
packing his seven or eight trunks and cases
of gimcracks if i am not mistaken it was
during this period that he conceived the
idea of the electric gun that afterward
brought us fame-and gray hairs

  our old side - partner willie kept in
touch with us all right hardly a day
dragged by that he didnt wire to ask for
news had my man showed up were we
all ready to take hold at valhalla would
we rather have such-and-such make of pho-
nograph would five hundred of the latest
records be acceptable for the same

   willies debt of gratitude to us for mend-
ing up a hole in his leg and feeding him
a little cheap chicken broth seemed all out
of proportion-still we couldnt very well
discourage the man seeing that we were the
objects of his beneficence

  one day near the expiration of my fort-
nights penance at wakickewa word came
from willie that the medicine-house had
been finished up and forwarded to val-
halla to await us there

   can you report without fail monday
am he wired will arrange as per
reply answer quick

  i decided to chance it and wafted him the
word that- wed be on hand if trains were
running although my relief hadnt hove in
sight honk grumbled a little because
theyd sent the car on ahead of us

  that spoils the triumphal entry he
said takes away fifty per cent of the
pomp and pageantry its like a circus
sending empty chariots and gilded cages
into a town a week in advance of the parade
it everlastingly upsets the psychological
moment and denudes the goddess drama of
all her trappings

   i didnt know there was a goddess by
that name i said but if youre dead set

upon turning our home - coming into a
comic opera we rnigh fix up and give a
parade monday at  am sharp along
eden boulevard in fiji costume beating
tom-toms and singing -just because she
made them goo-goo eves that ought
to thrill em

  saturday noon a malarial-looking person
alighted from tjhe local and introduced him-
self as the new incumbent of wakickewa
station he said hed been down in the
swamps for a year or two and that the cli-
mate hadnt agreed with his wife or he and
his wife hadnt agreed about the climate or
something anyhow the company had gra-
ciously permitted him to transfer his agree-
ments and disagreements to a more agree-
able sphere

  he said his wife had gone to her ruas to
stay until tjlie baby cut his other two front
teeth and he then wondered if house rent
was very high in wakickewa

  honk and i paid a glowing tribute to the
town we assured our new friend-his
name was ray tucker-that wakickewa
was just about the liveliest most hospitable
and satisfying small place wed ever been
con-er-permitted to abide in

  we insured him a pleasant and profitable
sojourn in the place made him a present of
our furnished flat with all the privileges
and luxurious appointments thereunto per-
taining-cook-stove skillet pie-pans and
all-and then we bade him bon jour and
many happy returns and caught the first
train we could inveigle into stopping

  it was a freight but that didnt mat-
ter most of honks baggage was freight
anyway

  at the first station of sufficient impor-
tance to afford passenger-train facilities we
piled off and waited for the flier if we
hadnt i firmly believe wed still be en route
for that freight we started on wasnt due in
k c till april  and it was three weeks
late when we left it on march 

   skipping lightly over the hallos and hand-
shakes along the line of the p and p when
from tjime to time we ran afoul of old cronies
like fuzz watts and willard sawyer and
others sunday evening at sundown found
us travel-fagged and dusty filled with the
fervor of youth and expectant-safe and
sound at millardsville with valhalla
twenty miles away

  it so happened that we had a choice of-
fered us we could stay all night in mil-
lardsville and go over to valhalla on the
honk and horace



red motor-car in the morning-
which would put us at our goal at
the rather late hour of nine-
thirty-or we could ride the
 jerk-water a mixture of milk-
cans chicken-coops and way-
freight which ambled over as
soon as they got loaded that night
and was supposed to make the run
in time to start back the next day

  i would have preferred walking
to the latter alternative and sleep-
ing in the hotel metropole in
millardsville to either but honk
must needs take that freight-train
or burn out a fuse

  we couldnt rest this close to
the old town he said well go
on in to-night and see her couchant
on the plain spangled with the
glitter from her thousands of
street-arcs resplendent with electric signs
and teeming with life a city at night is
a splendid sight - eh horace dont you
think

   the darkness hides many a defect i
admitted  but if we go on this train
everybodyll be gone to bed before we get
there what about our triumphal-

  never mind he said perhaps the
better way will be to enter quietly and take
up the thread of progress where we dropped
it without ostentation or ado  the boast
of heraldrv the pomp of power and all
that 

  when he got that far i scampered up the
ladder of the nearest box car and left him
whenever honk begins to elocute i take to
the woods

  honks baggage being many miles away
and as all the luggage we carried between
us consisted of a package of clean collars
id received from a laundry in sapulpa just
before we started our exodus from mil-
lardsville was not attended by any uproar
or clangor of baggage-vans or bustle of
porters

  the train-crew spied us on top of the box
car just before they got the last crate and
barrel loaded

  the conductor instituted the inquiries
and little informalities of a conversational
nature usually indulged in when a couple
of stranded floaters are found aboard while
the brakemen looked on with apparent en-
joyment all of them were strangers to
honk and me-they had come with the new
regime no doubt

mahogany and axminster and red
      leather chairs-

  fall offn that car youse said the
con arbitrarily wat you think this is
a scenic route beat it before i climb up
and bump the bumps with you 

  take it easy jason said honk
 your feet are too big for climbing-youd
make a better diver how soon do we
start  

  the brakeys broke into equine laughter
at thatj point and our big-footed friend
scrambled up to where we were with blood
in his eye honk calmly passed over the
final tag-end of our trip-ticket the cons
lamp-globe was almost too dirty to read by
-but the ticket served

   better come in the way-car men he
said  plenty of room to stretch out and


the railroad mans magazine

smoke and well have a game of pedro
goin over if you want to well be pullin
out in a minute or two

  we tjhanked him and said wed be glad
to play a few hands presently the engine
toot-tooted and we were off

   it was a line unostentatious little ride
the hind brakeman and tjhe conductor beat
honk and me four straight games of pedro
during the first ten miles everybody being
satisfied the game broke up and honk and
i ascended to tjie cupola to watch for the
first glimpse of valhalla nesting in the
shadow of the mystic hills we thought
we ought to be able to see the lights when
we rounded a certain curve

   i cant see a solitary glimmer said
honk peering carefully  i guess tjhe rum-
mies have quit lighting up the towers that
one out by the reservoir had twelve big
arcs on it if it was burning we surely
could see it from here

   maybe its foggy over there i said
 april is a foggy time of year or they may
be hiding their lights under bushel-baskets
or something for the sake of economy

  honk occupied the rest of the journey by
confiding to me what we were going to do
to resuscitate the town during the next fiscal
year shortly after ten oclock we hit the
yards and with the help of the conductors
lantern which he kindly loaned us groped
our way through the inky darkness to the
depot

  a smoking oil-lamp in the station office
was all the illumination visible the city
was plunged in gloom we opened the wait-
ing-room door and peered in

   a shadowy figure was sitting at tjhe table
inside the sanctum ticketorium we bold-
ly entered and honk secured the mans at-
tention by rattling the lattice

  whats the matter with your lights
he queried sternly

  the young man at the table tpok his time
about replying i admired his impressive
and trenchant style his learned and concise
summing up of the matter when he did re-
ply it was a very sweeping and compre-
hensive statementof the facts in the case-
in two words

   theyre out he said briefly

  are you the works at this place
honk asked with a fine sarcasm that was
wasted

  naw im the sultan of siam re-
turned the voice from the blur  anything
else you want to know  

  honk seemed somewhat taken aback so
i entered the breach

   allow me i said graciously  i am
the bey of beloochistan my friend ho-
henzollern and i would like to hold con-
verse with the main squeeze

  nothing doing said the oier you
might find him in the morning if youd
happen around he gets down about nine-
thirty if hes feeling well but say twont
do you no good to strike him for a job for
hes leaving tjiis dump to-morrow

   ahem  honk remarked but the
youth was warming to his work

   yeeh he continued  a couple of the
presidents pets are leaking charge a guy
named simmons or something and i dunno
the otherns name theyll find their work
cut out for em all right

  his nibs has let everything go to the
blink fired the power-house boss last
week and there aint been any lights in
town since valhallas going down every
day shes-on the decline

  i was just beginning to get interested in
the fellows breezy style when honk ap-
parently nailed an idea and hastily pushed
me out the door ahead of him

   heres where we get a move on us he
said when he had led me a few paces along
the platform  if we can find butch po-
teet well go out start the power-plant and
light up things huh the towns  going
down  every day is it  shes on the de-
cline is she well see about thatj well
show em how quick shell revive when the
right doctor prescribes hallo by hoky
the medicine-house

  it was we had stumbled on our fine
new coach sitting dark and deserted on the
siding behind the freight-room she was
a glossy brass-railed beautjy and no mis-
take

  we shinned up on the awning-covered
portico and tried the door it was locked
of course then i peeked through the big
bevel-plate window while honk held the
lantern

   mahogany i murmured in awe  and
axminster and red leather chairs-

  my rhapsody was rudely interrupted

   hey there  came the voice of the sta-
tion understudy from the open office win-
dow  you bums chase yourselves away
from that car ill get a cop down here in
five minutes and have you pinched hike
out of here 

  the lantern sputtered and went out at the
honk and horace



same instant chastened and subdued we
hopped hastily down and without a word
stumbled away in the darkness toward town

  there were very few pedestrians on the
streets valhalla seemed like a sick-room
where everybody was treading around 
tiptoes to keep from waking the patient

  we met a man some three or four blocks
farther on and honk paused to inquire the
way to butjph poteets the man said hed
never heard of such a person

honks idea was but little better the ex-
act spot by his reckoning when found was
occupied by a sheet-iron shed full of hay
belonging to a feed-and-fuel yard

   to thunder witjh him honk muttered
 well go out by ourselves i guess we
havent forgotten how to start a fire under
a set of boilers

   on with the dance i said  im with
you well make a night of it it was
nearly midnight by that time as i ascer-

x

we came out to fire up and start the

juice-plant

  honk thanked him and we continued on
our triumphal-well not exactly i noticed
that honk still carried the extinguished
lantern and i made some epigrammatic al-
lusion to his following in the footsteps of
diogenes honk sniffed and set the lan-
tern on a gate-post where we left it to its
fate

  we fhought we knew where butch poteet
had formerly resided and steered a zigzag
course in tjiat direction the night was
somewhat thick-not to say opaque-which
may have confused us

  at any rate when we got to where butch
had made his place of abode according to
my recollection it was a vacant lot-and

tained by consulting the regulator in the
glare of a one-thousandth candle - power
match

  i suggested that we might work to better
advantage if we had a light lunch-ham
and eggs pie cereals etc-before we es-
sayed our task but honk overruled the
motion

  that power-house was the hardest thing
to find ive ever strained my eagle eyes
looking for several times we came very
near deciding that it had been eradicated
from the face of the earth but we couldnt
find the place it had stood on so a lingering
hope remained

  now and then we collided with some


the railroad mans magazine



obstruction or stepped into a vacancy in tlie
atmosphere that jarred our back teeth loose
all of which made it very cheerful i for
one became so utterly bewildered that holes
looked like embankments and level pave-
ments like ravines

   with some little exertion we safely thread-
ed a maze of ponds fell and slid along with
an avalanche of tin cans down a dump
climbed the side of a canon ran into a fire-
plug splashed several mudholes dry-and
then we found the object of our search

  here we are said honk wed
ought to have followed the switch-track
around from the depot and saved time

   to say nothing of the wear and tear on
the landscape i added  i wish i had a
change of clothes and a dutch lunch 

   cheer up  he said  the worst is
over

  we groped our way along the damp brick
wall of the building coming to a door after
a while which was locked of course

   maybe we can get in through the coal-
chutes honk said we groped our way
to the rear of the place where a coal-car
stood along the wall

   we scuttled up the side and over the top
discovered a black hole climbed through
and dropped on all fours to a pile of steam
coal from which we made our way-pretty
well soiled but still patriotic - into the
boiler-room

  i struck a match

  in its momentary gleam honk surveyed
the interior and i surveyed honk he was
a sight for the gods

  now if we can rustle a lamp or a light
of some sort he said the restll be easy
in a couple of hours well have this outfit
hollering for the union but say theyve
made some radical changes around here me-
thinks the place dont look natural

  at that juncture he made a discovery

  what do you know about this he
exclaimed fires banked he held a
lighted match so he could see the steam-
dial  and eighty pounds of steam what
was it that kid at the depot said hadnt
-had no lights for a week theres some-
thing decomposed in denmark horace
lets investigate this joint a little

  we made our way quietly up a short
flight of steps and through a little doorway
into what was presumably the dynamo-
room

   fleres some more funny how-dye-dos
said honk this looks more like an ice-

plant than a dynamo-room compressors
by cricky what are we up against
horace  

  i opened my mouth to extend the usual
invitation for a personal search-but the
words were still-born a hateful-looking
sour-visaged man with a revolver that
looked as big as a turret-gun on the battle-
ship iowa riz up from behind a steam-chest
and took possession of us he told us to
put up them hands  i did so-

  honk hesitated and-bang the bullet
whined by honks-ear and-he put em up

within a minute after the shot a second
ruffian appeared on the scene with an addi-
tional cannon the opposing forces being
more evenly matched we offered to arbitrate
honk volunteered a line of explanations
we came out to fire up and start the
juice-plant he said reassuringly  im
simpson of the transcontinental put up
your artillery gents we wont hurt you
they gave us the gloomy glare

   search em bill growled the mean-
looking one  n see if theyve got any
shootin-irons weve been lookin for you
two for some time he continued address-
ing honk and me  the valhalla packin
companys been havin brass and lead pipe
swiped for some time and theyre gettin
tired of it now you two just keep your
flippers up and march where we tell you 
to make mince-meat of a lengthy recital
they drilled us through a side entrance and
along a loading - dock to a signalophone
there bill requisitioned the patrol-wagon
and a flock of cops while the other kept two
eyes and his armory trained on us and
studiously ignored all explanations excuses
alibis and pleadings for clemency

  tell your troubles to the judge he
said  he gets paid for listening to em
we dont

  i climbed into die j ingle-j angle wagon
and sat down with a sigh of relief a ride
back over diat dark road to town looked
good to me honk however lost his tem-
per threatened to resist arrest and-you
know what happens when a fellow resists
arrest biff bim well he thought
better of it before it was too late

  so we rode back to town

  at  am by the clock over the sergeants
desk we were booked in the big book-our
names were not familiar to anybody present

-	refused bail until after breakfast and
ruthlessly locked with a clang in an iron
cell that smelled worse than i expected
honk and horace



locked in the hold-over as suspicious char-
acters bah and we made the town what
it is brought em up out of obscurity-
for this 

  well have to stay in nights i said
 or get us a guardian to look after us when
we wander at large

  the chilly dove-colored dawn straggled
through the grating of our cell-door after an
interminable wait but breakfast was a long-
er time coming than that

  i	too almost lost my temper and when

tousled hair behind a regulation bar of
judgment

  we were arraigned without having had a
chance to brush off wash the coal dust or
mud from our faces and hands or tidy our-
selves up in the least whatever the charge
might be we looked guilty on general
principles

   feloniously entering and obtaining ac-
cess    with intent to pilfer and steal the
clerk read sonorously

  admitted to bail snapped the judge

  honk raved and gnawed at the grating
i might have snatched a few minutes
repose if he hadnt took on so and if i
hadnt been so empty i still contend that
honk would have looked at the matter more
in the light of a joke if we had hunted up
a restaurant and fed our faces before start-
ing out that night

  an empty stomach is a pessimists best bet
and a handicap to philosophy

   come on sit down and let your blood
cool off i advised  theyll apologize
and turn us loose in the morning as soon
as somebody with a human brain shows up
why all this charging back and forth
polyphemus id rather be here than
scaling ponds and wading dumps out
there in the inky darkness

   but the humiliation horace the
preposterous ridiculous grotesque plu-
perfect asininity of the thing well
be the laughing-stock of the commu-
nity a fine reception for us isnt it

they passed in our allowance it consisted of
a solitary sinker and a tin cup full of sour
coffee

  i went to pieces after that breakfast my
tire was punctured i had borne up bravely
until then-but when they brought us that
breakfast hope shrieked and fell frothing
at the mouth and gloomy forebodings fore-
closed a mortgage on my soul

  at eight-thirty a big duffer with a key
attached to a wooden paddle opened the
door of our coop he then escorted us into
the presence of justice in the shape of a
slant-browed man with a cruel mouth and

come on sit down and let

your blood cool off


the railroad aians magazine

two thousand dollars each cash bond
required

  honk cleared his throat and lifted a sooty
hand

  excuse me judge he said this
charge is all a ridiculous mistake we can
easily prove our identity but we want this
thing kept quiet it has been a very hu-
miliating contretemps i ask you to tele-
phone the representative of the transcon-
tinental and have him come here at once
hell vouch for us

  the clerk of the court did the telephoning
he announced the result in a bored voice

  witness states over the phone that two
men were hanging around the depot last
night they acted suspiciously and were
ordered off says the taller man was named
hohenzollern and the short one gave a name
impossible to remember

  the court tightened up his lip and fixed
us with a baleful eye

   make that bond-

   just a-moment  shouted honk  that
was an irresponsible boy talking to you
call the transcontinental man i tell vou

  or send for doc pillsbury or j carter
finley i added  they know us were
the new-

  the blare and boom of a brass band
passing along the street drowned further
argument for the time being the court re-
laxed its dignity long enough to look out of
the window honk and i being near the
same window necked with the rest

  a considerable crowd of citizens in car-
riages and on foot were out early engaged
in some kind of a demonstration i caught
a glimpse of several familiar faces among
which was butch poteet large as life and
beating the bass drum in die band

   whats up   asked the judge  where
are they headed for

   i understand returned the clerk  that
two young men who formerly represented
the railroad company here are expected on
the morning motor theyre coming back
to take charge of the railroads interests
thats the reception committee-

   lock these men up said the judge
 i think ill go down to the station myself
court is now adjourned

cutting down casualties

the  sfety first movement on the chicago and northwestern meets

with promising results

casualties to employees of the chicago
and northwestern railway have been re-
duced during the last few months to the extent
of fifteen per cent in the number of fatalities re-
ported and ten per cent in the number of injuries
such a statement ought to attract attention
humanitarians will be glad to learn of the pro-
gress and railroad officials from the standpoint
of efficiency will be interested to know by what
means the good results were secured vet the
plan is simple enough

  every one who has looked into the subject is
familiar with the fact that the lamentable totals
to which the industrial accidents of the country
mount up are due not so much to the great
catastrophes the accidents of large magnitude
wherein numbers are killed or injured but pri-
marily the frightful aggregate is due to the many
small accidents involving as a rule but one man

  these minor accidents in the vast majority of
cases are due to comparatively insignificant
causes they are brought about by the failure
of employees in some every-day matter or the
ncglcct of some elementary precaution care-
lessness or thoughtlessness sometimes due to ig-
norance or inexperience cause injuries in ways

  that are subject to the most simple remedies if
rhe men themselves could but be brought to have
the proper interest in the matter

  working upon this theory a systematic cam-
paign for safety was organized under the direc-
tion of the claim-departmerrt of the chicago and
northwestern railway somewhat less than a year
ago it involved means for the education of
officers and employees in the benefits that might
be gained by following the watchword of the
movement  safety first and means for securing
the cooperation of the men in all the departments
of the road

  the most recent development of the plan and
what has given the remarkable results mentioned
in beginning our comments was the organization
of safety committees there is first a central
committee of which mr r c richards general
claim-agent is chairman and which is composed
of two general superintendents the engineer of
maintenance the assistant superintendent of mo-
tive-power and machinery supervisor of motive
power and machinery trainmaster of the freight-
terminals and the assistant superintendent of the
car department

  there is then on each division a division safetv
first aid to the injured

s

committee composed of the divisonal officers and
there is an employees committee on each division
composed of an engineer fireman conductor
brakeman trackman station-agent and switch-
man and a similar committee of employees for
the shops and roundhouses the employees com-
mittees hold their individual meetings once a
month and they are given trips of inspection over
their respective divisions accompanied by the
division and some of the general officers

  on these trips they divide themselves into sub-
committees each of which gives especial notice to
certain subjects assigned to it going over the
ground thoroughly

  in this way every detail of tracks yards sta-
tions roundhouses machinery and shops are in-
spected and the faulty conditions either remedied
by ihe division officers or reported to the supe-
rior committee- the railway and engineering
review

 first aid to the injured

valuable instructions issued by the pennsylvania railroad for the use of

                  its employees in case of accident

    he person in authority should take charge
        keep cool

  send for the nearest physician give him as
near as possible the character of the injuries do
not wait to get a number of physicians this can
be done later if necessary

  remove injured person from the wreckage using
the utmost care not to further injure him

  stretcher the stretcher can be used as
a cot it requires three men to place a person
properly on a stretcher set up the stretcher
place it alongside the injured person the three
men should then stand at the side of the injured
person away from the stretcher one should place
his hands under the head and shoulders the other
under the hips and the third take charge of the
injured part lift him up and lay him gently on
the stretcher

 keep the crowd away so as to insure
plenty of fresh air

  examine the injuries carefully before doing
anything

  dont touch open wounds with the hands
nor attempt to remove dirt nor apply unclean
dressings of any kind as infection may be intro-
duced by so doing

  first - aid packet contains two aseptic
compresses wrapped in oil paper one cambric
bandage one triangular bandage and two safely
pins in dressing wounds place the compress on
the wound without touching that part which comes
in contact with the wounded surface secure with
the cambric bandage and if necessary wrap the
whole with triangular bandage this latter can
be also used as a sling and to secure splints if
the contents of the one packet are insufficient use
more

  hemorrhage to arrest hemorrhage place
compresses on the bleeding part and secure firmly
with the cambric bandage if bleeding continues
apply more compresses and more pressure until
bleeding ceases if this fails tie a bandage
around the limb between the point of hemorrhage
and the body and twist tightly with a stick until
bleeding stops then secure bandage

  fracture broken bones should be treated
with splints the splints secured in position by
triangular and other bandages the splints should
reach from below the lower joint to the one above
the fracture folded newspapers pieces of board
heavy pasteboard or anything sufficient to pre-
vent movement of the broken ends of bones upon
each other will answer

  burns burns should be treated in the same
manner as wounds do not forcibly remove cloth-
ing cut the clothes away if necessary where
there is much pain common baking soda dis-
solved in water may be used to saturate bandage
dont use preparations of oil as they are liable
to cause infection

  shock shock is a condition of almost com-
plete absence of the signs of life such as sighing
respiration pale cold clammy skin etc dont
give whisky or any other stimulants or drugs
the principal requirements are internal and ex-
ternal heat by means of hot coffee hot milk and
other hot drinks and the application of heat by
means of blankets hot water-bottles hot bricks
etc in cases of apparent drowning and electrical
shock use artificial respiration as taught in first
aid lectures

  unconsciousness persons unconscious
from any cause should be removed to a quiet place
and laid upon the back keep every one away
and let plenty of air get to the sick person loosen
the clothing about the neck and abdomen if the
conditions are like shock use same treatment

  fits a person suffering from a fit should be
kept quiet on the back loosen the clothing about
ihe neck and abdomen and be careful he docs not
injure himself while in the fit

 heat exhaustion and sunstroke
in the former the skin will be cold and clammy
and the conditions will be the same as shock the
same treatment will be required in cases of
sunstroke the body feels hot to the touch is dry
apply ice to the abdomen head and other parts
of the body by rubbing with pieces of ice or crack-
ing the ice and putting it in cloths over the parts
named above
the a b c of freight rates

by john c thomson

in the two articles which appeared in the january and february numbers
of the railroad mans magazine we discussed freight rates from
the standpoint of the land in this article we will look at the subject
from the standpoint of water competition and inland waterways

    all that we know about freight rates to-day can be summed up briefly
i that transportation by ocean river canal and railroad is in each case a
separate proposition  that there is as much difference between a canal
and a river as there is between an ocean and a railroad  that all four
have great influence on each other but just to what extent no man knows

	that the railroad seems to have a closer connection with each of the three
water routes than they have with each other  that cartage through the
streets of a city has a great and direct bearing on all four

aside from certain conditions largely established by nature the making
of freight rates is largely guesswork based on
the elastic  per-ton mile

part iii

cars are under united states control-ex
cept those running on canadian soil and
across the narrow neck of land in mexico
from ocean to gulf all the deep-sea ves-
sels are not under our control our cot
ing vessels are to be sure but a ship
flying the british flag and running with
wheat from portland oregon to liverpool
england is practically free of all our laws
in regard to freight-rates

  yet this ship carries wheat in competi-
tion with our transcontinental railroads
and therefore it greatly affects freight-
rates between ever- town from oregon to
new york

  keeping this fact in mind let us see by
illustration how it works out in practise
we will say that the interstate commerce
commission the shippers all the way from
the pacific to the atlantic seaboards and the
railroads-hay a dozen of them-have all
agreed on certain rates on all goods



           the early days of the interstate
commerce commission that body
endeavored to confine itself to
rates on land alone but soon
found as it so well worded the
matter  water competition is
like banquos ghost it will not stay buried
and rises at the most awkward times
through sheer force of circumstance the
commission was compelled to consider water
competition in connection with every rail-
road freight-rate in the united states

  what made this a very awkward matter
was that congress in its innocence about
such affairs practically forbade the com-
mission having anything to do with ship
traffic directly or indirectly but ships and
freight-cars have a way of combining in
spite of congress or commission so in time
both bodies slowly awoke to the fact that
the two would have to be considered together
another trouble enters all the freight-
the a b c of freight rates



  wheat shall pay so much lumber so
much shoes so much iron ore so much
coal so much and so on indefinitely all
is peace and everything is working smooth-
ly when suddenly this same english ship-
multiplied by a hundred more-offers to
carry lumber to europe from puget sound
for less than we charge to haul it by rail to
new york or boston and then by ship to
europe

  as we have practically no ships on any
ocean given to commerce the ship charges
from new york or boston to england or
germany or france are made by foreign
ship owners therefore we cannot lower
the ocean rate from the atlantic cities of
america to europe and if we do not lower
our rates from puget sound to europe on
some part of the route we get nothing to
carry

  it will all go in the bottoms of the british
ships clearly we must cut the railroad
rate on lumber or wheat or whatever the
cargo is between new york and the pacific
coast

  right here our troubles all break out
afresh where all was industrial peace all
is now confusion it is much like a hive of
bees every one is happy putting up honey
till some one from the outside world sud-
denly smokes them out

  if the rate is cut on transcontinental wheat
and lumber-as it must be cut if it is to be
moved over our rails-then other rates must
go up or else the railroad must go out of
business

  that is practically impossible so up go
the rates on other goods but down they go
on transcontinental but not local lumber
and wheat

its positive effects

  this has two immediate effects it puts
a shoe merchant in denver say out of busi-
ness because he cannot pay the higher
freight-rates on shoes and live and it makes
the through rate on wheat from puget
sound to the atlantic-less than from ne-
braska to the same port

  these two men complain and their cry
is just apparently but what can be done
about it all any one can do is to refer
the nebraska wheat farmer and the denver
shoe man to the owner of the british tramp-
ship and beg him to raise his rates on
wheat from puget sound to liverpool

  the britisher grins and remarks that
what happens is none of his concern

  so when some local experts gather around
a stove in podunk center and after agree-
ing that the united states can whip the
world with one hand tied behind its back
let them remember that uncle sam cannot
dictate what an english ship owner shall
charge for transporting wheat between any
two ports in the world unless both these
ports are under the stars and stripes

  such very shortsightedness is the cause
perhaps of nine-tenths of all our freight-
rate rows as a weary freight-rate clerk
writes in the february number of the
railroad mans magazine he is asked
over the telephone a dozen times a day to
explain in a few moments what is here
taking us many pages just to outline

clerk vs shipper

  the line of conversation runs something
jike this

  irate shipper say you youve
made a mistake youve charged us 
more on this carload of lumber than you
did on the previous car-the one we shipped
two months ago and this car has  less
feet of lumber in it at that why cant
you keep your books straight anyway
gone to sleep up there or are you just try-
ing to slip something over on us what 
weary clerk  rates gone up on lum-
ber since the first of the month sorry
but your bill is correct

  irate shipper  go chase yourself son
i was shipping lumber over your road be-
fore you were born you cant tell me
anything about rates on lumber i know
thats my business see now see here
why has that rate gone up wasnt you
gouging us lumber dealers enough as it
was giving the screw another twist eh
why dont you answer my question why
is the rate higher

  weary clerk  well you see the trans-
continental rate on lumber has gone down
and so we have to raise the local rates-
irate shipper  suffering cats do you
mean that you have the nerve to sit there
and tell me to my face that youve cut the
rate on my stuff over a three-thousand-mile
haul and at the same time have raised me
between here and chicago four hundred
miles youve got to show me

  weary clerk  but you see the tramp
steamship line running from liverpool
to seattle cut the lumber rate and so we
had to-


the railroad mans magazine

  irate shipper now see here son
dont you try to stuff me like that eng-
land has nothing to do with railroad rates
between chicago and this great city of po-
dunk-the city of homes im going to re-
port you to the interstate commerce com-
mission and write a letter to the newspapers
ive got to pay you of course but its rob-
bery english tramp steamer lumber
from chicago to podunk rats 

   now if this shipper would only get down
his globe take an a b c course in phys-
ical and commercial geographv read a
primer on economics he might learn some-
thing not only does the british steamship
owner have a great deal to say what mr
podunk pays on his lumber by the carload
but the french peasant-multiplied by a
few million-through the bank of france
has a great deal more to say 

   in other words no town be it in ameri-
ca or europe can escape the world-wide in-
fluence of interlaced capital the minute
that mr podunk reads that some big ameri-
can railroad has placed  more
in bonds in the french market just at that
moment he should have learned the fact that
jean the gardener planting lettuce for the
paris market has a great deal to say about
what he mr podunk shall pay on his load
of lumber from chicago to his home town

government subsidies

  enough has been shown here i hope to
prove that an english ship on which the
french hold a mortgage can and does affect
every railroad rate in the united states
but there are other ships than those of
england germany has some so has japan
to make matters worse they are subsidized
by their governments

  a subsidy is paid by a government to
help defray the running expenses of a ship
for instance a certain ship costs -

	to build and  a year to run
the government pays say half the build-
ing cost and  yearly toward run-
ning the ship in return it has the right
to use the ship in war there are many
other arrangements but this serves our pur-
pose here

   we have a ship earning interest on only
half its cost and with this ship our rail-
roads must compete it would be bad enough
to fight against a ship that had to earn in-
terest on her total cost just as a railroad
must but this subsidy gives the ship two

hands to fight with against the railroads
one	-

  we are now beginning to see that many
things affect railroad freight-rates of which
the average shipper never dreams

one reason for subsidies

   if great britain for instance thinks that
germany might declare war in  and
that plenty of big ocean-going ships would
come in handy during a war she increases
her subsidies

  more ships are built entering the
worlds trade they take lumber from seat-
tle to any port in the world where there hap-
pens to be a market

   england does not rtint to bear the total
expense of building these ships nor to have
them anchored idle in her harbors so they
get cargees at any old rate just to keep full
and moving and the government at home
foots the shortage as a war measure

  against such competition as this what
can the united states railroad freiglit-agent
do nothing yet he is cussed and be-
rated daily from one end of the country to
the other for something for which he is
blameless

   we have looked on salt water only now
let us take a long look-see inland
where rolls the oregon where die father
of waters flows and where incidentally
the missouri gets on a rampage and changes
state lines every year or two

   stately ships with canvas spread to the
zephyrs of iowa corn-fields great steamers
plowing across the prairies of nebraska
loaded in paris and unloaded at your door
in bismarck dakota is not likely to come
to pass

small river traffic

                              v

   before me as i write is a map issued by
the united states government showing in
red ink all the navigable waters of this
country three feet in depth or over a
glance at the map shows that considerably
over one-half of the united states is as
white as snow that from the missouri
river to the pacific coast navigable streams
are about as rare as dodos

   the map also indicates that to-day in-
land water shipments are mostly limited to
the mississippi hudson and columbia
rivers and their branches

   river traffic on the columbia is practi-
cally nothing-not counting of course the
the a b c bf freight rates

s

use of the river for the first hundred miles
as the entrance of portlands harbor traf-
fic on the missouri is even less valuable
so we are reduced to the mississippi and the
hudson as the only two river traffic-carriers
in the united states

  here and there some little steamboat puffs
along but it is more local pride than any-
thing else and pleasure passengers pay most
of the profits

  the connection of inland waterways with
railroad freight-rates is this

  most of the tonnage - the amount of
freight hauled over our rails to-day-con-
sists of such material as coal ore lumber
and grain cheap heavy material in regard
to which speed of transportation is not of
immediate importance fruit or live stock
has to be moved as rapidly as possible like
passenger traffic but iron ore can move five
miles an hour or fifteen miles an hour de-
pending on which speed is the cheapest-
and it matters little

  it is suggested that a great deal of this
heavy cheap freight can be moved over in-
land waterways thus saving the expense of
shipping by rail and leaving the railroad
free to handle the goods that must move
quickly

  this is practically the sole reason why in-
land waterways are favored by many al-
though there are several other indirect
reasons

  a railroad by its very nature must be
under one control but the waterway like
the common road is open to every one

  thus it is said that with free waterways
competition will regulate freight-rates and
prevent the railroads from dictating rates
in other words if the rate by rail on coal is
too high then the coal will move by water
and therefore the rail-rate can never be
higher than the water-rate while the freight
is open to every one who wants to build and
run a boat

rivers and canals

  to return to our ships sailing from chi-
na to north dakota by way of the indian
and south atlantic oceans the mississippi
and the missouri rivers this foolish idea
has been actually suggested as being prac-
tical

the water of a river is fresh that of the
sea is salt salt water supports a heavier
load per cubic unit than does fresh water
any one may test this by dropping an egg
s rr

into fresh water and then adding salt till
the egg floats as applied to ships this
means that a vessel loaded to draw ten feet
at sea will draw over ten feet in fresh water
if loaded properly in fresh water then more
cargo must be added when salt water is
reached or the reverse

  the ocean is deep and propulsion is easy
a river or a canal is usually shallow the
bottom of the river is only a few feet below
the bottom of the vessel and a screw stirs
up the mud and causes bars to form the
side-wheeler is the best form of boat for the
usual river but they are no longer com-
mercially possible on the ocean

  then too vessels large enough to pay
a profit on the sea are too large to enter
most of our rivers except perhaps in a few
cases at the very mouth j j hill says that
a vessel must be able to carry  tons
to compete successfully with the freight-car
and no -ton vessel is practical on
inland waterways the great lakes are
not considered here as inland waterways
we are dealingwith rivers and canals only

full cars only

  there is a vast difference between a river
and a canal a river rises and falls from
one month to another depending on the
ram-fall and the melting of snow often
thousands of miles away while the water
of a canal is practically of the same depth
the year round ice frequently closes rivers
and canals in winter

  the difference of the depth of water from
time to time is of great importance

  in the case of a canal a warehouse can
be erected at the very waters edge and
machinery installed to handle freight but
in the case of the river the warehouse must
ever be above the highest possible water line
and this leaves the vessel considerably away
from the warehouse when there is low water
in the river

  a river has a current but a canal has
none-except perhaps a very slow current
hardly worth considering every one knows
that it takes more power and time to go up-
stream than down it frequently takes from
two to five times as long to go up-stream
as down

  we have seen the importance of regular
service and full cars both ways in railroad
practise the same applies to freight-serv-
ice by water in a canal the conditions are
similar to those of a railroad but in a
c



the railroad mans magazine

river the current cuts a vast figure if it is
at all swift in places or at certain times
then too sand and mud-bars are always
forming and changing in a river but not so
in a canal

  inland waterways it has been seen are
divided into two parts-the river and the
canal there is a closer connection between
the railroad and the canal than there is be-
tween the canal and the river the freight-
car is only a canal-boat floating on axle-
grease instead of water

merely a matter of friction

  transportation in the last analysis re-
duces itself to a matter of friction and the
car-wheel is related closer to the rail than it
is to the body of the car there is but little
friction between the wheel and the rail the
friction all comes between the axle and the
wheel and here the axle floats on axle-
grease just as does the canal-boat in the
water

  the canal-boat is cheaper and easier to
move because the friction on the water per
pound of load is less than the friction be-
tween the axle and the wheel that is all
there is to it

  friction spells coal engine-power heavier
rails and bridges lower grades in fact
friction is responsible for nine-tenths of the
cost of building and running a railroad
therefore just because the canal-boat meets
with less friction for the same load we
have this great question of inland water-
ways slowly coming before the public

  here we come to one of the most uncer-
tain things in the railroad world the fa-
mous ton-mile

  the ton-mile means this suppose a
railroad hauls  tons  miles
another railroad hauls  tons  miles
by multiplying the tons and the miles to-
gether we get in either case  ton-
miles  x  or  x  equals

	in either case

  now  ton-miles is supposed to
be equal to hauling  ton  miles or

	tons one mile this is the ton-
mile in theory

the  per-ton  mile

  there are so many railroads and so
many different lengths of hauls-in fact
millions of them-that some common basis
of measurement must be taken to get an

idea of what it costs to run one railroad as
compared with another railroad and for a
hundred and one other comparisons

  if a man in salt lake city thinks that
the general pacific railroad is charging
him too much for freight from chicago and
he goes before the interstate commerce
commission with hisgrievance the railroad
man rises in open court and proves that the
general pacific is only earning one cent
per ton-mile compared to the podunk and
pacific which is allowed by the commission
to earn two cents per ton-mile

  so we see how important this  per ton-
mile  is in railroad matters in measuring
freight traffic it is the same as the pound to
the grocery-store the foot-rule to the land
surveyor or the second to the watchmaker
-the standard of measurement

  however the ton-mile has been severely
attacked as an unsafe and unreliable meas-
uring-stick it is claimed that the very
basis of the ton-mile is not sound-that to
move one ton  miles is not equal to
moving  tons one mile or  tons

	miles

  in abstract physics the amount of force
energy is the same in each case but the
railroad in our workaday world has many
other things to consider than mere physics
loading and unloading for instance

  no basis for foreign comparison

  to pull  tons of coal one mile
over level rails would cost probably about
half a cent a ton or a total of  but to
load and unload that coal by hand would
cost many times  in this case the
ton-mile charge would be about half a cent
plus load and unloading charges of say
 cents a ton or a total ton-mile cost of
  cents

  to load one ton and unload it at the
end of its journey would cost at the same
assumed rate for shoveling only  cents
the cost of moving a ton one mile would
be half a cent just as in the other case but
this half-dollar loading and unloading
charge would be spread so thin over that

	miles of run that it could hardly
be figured

  so we have  times a higher ton-mile
charge in one case than in the other and the
basis is supposed to be the same

  so far as i know there is no reliable
basis for any comparison of freight-rates
between europe and america the ways
the a b c of freight rates



of bookkeeping vary widely in european
countries-france figures one way and
germany another - the distances vary so
greatly the amount and character of goods
hauled van so greatly and the laws regula-
ting railroads and railroad construction are
so different that the ton-mile as a meas-
urement between european and american
railroads is hardly worthy of consideration

  although there is no basis of comparison
the ton-mile is often used to prove things
one way or another-just as the prover
wishes

  there is no  common ground  in figur-
ing the cost of operation of the railroads of
various countries all we can get is the
grand totals these are of questionable
value

  inland waterways from the standpoint
of cost to build and operate as compared
with a railroad or the entire railroad service
of the nation is an interesting phase
about the only comparison attempted so
far has been with the ton-mile and as we
have just seen that that is not a safe guide

  right here stalks in the door-to-door
service of the freight-car compared to the
canal-boat or the river-boat by  door-
to-door  is meant that a freight-car can be
loaded at a factory door in battle creek
michigan and unloaded at a warehouse
door in denver colorado thus doing away
with the cost of all cartage through the
streets of either city

  in the case of a boat on the erie canal
one might or might not be able to load the
boat at the factory door in buffalo and he
certainly could not unload it at a warehouse
door in new york city

cost of city cartage

  so while the ton-mile figure might be
less by way of the canal-boat when city
cartage is added the ton-mile charge leaps
far above that of the freight-car moving
freight is not simply from city to city nor
from depot to depot but from  door to
door and this may or may not mean the
often very expensive item of cartage through
crowded city streets

  the belt line railroad circling chi-
cago saves that city millions of dollars year-
ly in cartage charges

  freight must be sorted and distributed
just like letters in the mail in fact when

it comes right down to actual facts a letter
is just as much freight as is an ounce of
coal and what applies to the mail service
in most cases fits equally well in freight
transportation

   that our rivers run idle to-day is due to
three possible reasons

  first because no river or canal can
compete with the freight-car running from
door to door

  second because the rivers and canals
would be of the utmost value if they were
provided with suitable terminals which
to-day are lacking

  third because the railroads are the
keenest competitors of inland waterways

waterways out of date

   it may be true that the river and the canal
are as hopeless out of date as the stage-
coach the ox-cart and the pack-mule but
i do not know and i do not believe that
any man knows if he does i would like
to learn his reasons for so thinking provided
he does not base his conclusions on the ton-
mile or too much on averages

  the vicious habit of thinking in aver-
ages is well to keep in mind when one is
considering freight-rates a good mathe-
matician or bookkeeper can play with a
set of books about as he pleases with his
journal and ledger he can prove almost any-
thing and then turn around and prove just
the contrary

  all that any unbiased man to-day knows
about european and american freight-
rates compared one to the other is that
there seems to be no fair basis of compari-
son the european railroad for instance
is maintained to a considerable extent as a
war measure like a fort or a battle-ship
in america all railroads except the union
pacific which was a war measure are pure-
ly commercial concerns this alone destroys
all possibilities of economic commercial
or financial comparison hence concern-
ing waterways we cannot turn to europe
for a guide with much hope of light on the
subject as applied to the united states

  one might as well try to measure real
estate with a rubber band as to prove any-
thing concerning freight by the ton-mile
and so long as this is true inland water-
ways will remain a matter of study rather
than of definite conclusion

 in the fourth and concluding article in this series which will appear in our july number mr
 thomson will discuss freight-rates from the bookkeeping and financial point of view

by george foxhall

                   sad schmidt falls heir to great
                   wealth and misses his schedule

im a sort of ancient mariner though	schmidt ive been thinking it over ever

the pennsylvania railroad ferry	since in the constant glow of the tail-lights

between desbrosses street and	of missed trains and ive come to the con-

jersey city is the nearest i ever	elusion that sad schmidt is a contagious

 was to going to sea anyhow like	disease a desolation a pestilence and a de-

that poetic person ive got a yarn	praved liar that is provided somebody

that ive got to get out of my system and	hasnt ended his blighting career with a rope

then you ran kill me if you like	or a gun by this time

its now two years since i met sad	youll notice how my paragraphs end with

aunt johanna
thought that
was how people
got onto
steamboats
catching the boat



talk about sudden death well thats the
morbid condition to which sad schmidt has
driven me you have probably gathered
that i hate sad schmidt i do likewise
his present family an his antecedents unto
the first generation what did he do

  he told me a story thats all but
say that story has laid across my haunted
life like the ghost of a welsh rarebit

  wait an ill tell it to you not because i
want to entertain you but because i might

pass the hoodoo on an be rid of it and as
youll observe im a misanthrope with a
grouch

  i was once a happy care-free genial-
hearted man i carried through life a lend-
rne - a - dollar expression my temper was
good an my morals quite unapproachable
if you had known me then you would have
loved me	

  to add atmosphere to my general charac-
ter i will add that i am a traveling sales-
man for a soap house our matchless
cleansers were the envy and admiration of
our competitors

  well two years ago i made boolaboo
texas in the flush of youth an optimism
an the confident belief that i would sell a
bill of goods to a hypocritical boolabooer
named job jordan i hadnt much time to
do it and make the six-thirty out but id

come half a day out of my route to sell
things to jordan-so i meant to do it

  i showed him samples of all our latest
grease-eaters i scoured all his pots an
pans cleaned his filthy transom polished
the parlor mirror an then scrubbed down
the counter it was hard work but he was
as interested as a kid at a pig-killing an
i expected to get my days wage out of him

  just as i was rolling down my sleeves i
heard the six-thirty at the whistling-post
but i only smiled philosophically there
was another train at eight oclock an i
knew by the pleased examination of mr
jordan that i was going to do business

  i whipped out my order-book an flipped
the perspiration from my brow

  you shore have got a handy line o
goods said the boolabooer  an you shore
are industrious at deemonstratin em

  why thats what im hired for you
know mr jordan said i with a happy
modest smirk an i slipped the cap from
my fountain pen

   i suppose so said mr jordan squint-
ing admiringly along the counter now
that there feller thatj peddles for the snow
soap syndicate came along last week an he
didnt do moren just polish up a lincoln
penny an doggone me if i didnt sign a
contract to sell nothin but their goods for
ten years what a fool i was 

  nit i saw that instanter he was no
fool it was me

  i slipped my pen an book back in my
pocket an yanked out my watch

  i reckon ive missed my train i said
calm and resigned

  thats a shame droned job calm an
resigned likewise  youd orter watch that
but maybe youd a missed it anyhow
some folks miss trains an boats by nature
no matter how they try now theres sad
schmidt there sittin on that barl he
never caught a train ins life did you
sad  

  nor a boat moaned out the mournful-
est voice in the universe an i turned to
see the forlorn an haunting figure of the
man who was to upheave my moral centers
an send me thudding down the road of life
with three wheels on the rails an the other
scattering my fires of ambition as it bumped
the ties of doom

  to call him sad was an insult to mel-
ancholy hecuba an the wandering jew
and the guy who never smiled again were
cheerful playmates compared with him


the railroad mans magazine

  he was dressed in what were supposed
to be clothes but they looked like hed got
em too late to do any good the coat-
sleeves lacked a good four inches an the
pants a good seven you could see he
hadnt even a melancholy pride in his fail-
ings but evidently job was proud of em
for him else he was covering his own four-
flushing

  no sir said job pretending to be en-
tertaining nor none of his family never
caught a train did they sad

  nor a boat mused sad

  i shouldnt think they could miss any
boats in boolaboo said i dropping into
a creaky chair an discovering how hard id
worked

  weve traveled said sad turning up
another sod with his grave-digging voice

  sad nearly lost half a million dollars
missin boats one time said job him an
his family

  i wondered what sad would have looked
like if hed lost that half a million right
out but i said nothing i hadnt got my
second wind yet

  tell him about it sad urged the old
machiavelli  itll keep him from worry-
in about his own train

   itll hoodoo him droned sad  it
alius does it to strangers if he hears it
hell never catch a train again without
missin one before he gets it

  job laughed an if id known then what

i	know now id a choked him an sad
schmidt right there an a took my chances
on hanging

   thats the only joke that sad ever
makes said he an lies mighty fond
of it

    he looks like lies fond o somethin de-
pressing said i and because i was sick
of the sight an sound of job i turned to
sad schmidt

  narrate the narrative i suggested
reaching between his long legs an pulling
an apple out of the barrel

  he came right at ilj he didnt cough
twitch his collar clear his throat smile nor
hitch his pants above the knee he didnt
make any of the customary introductions
he just slid into that yarn like id dropped
a quarter in his gas-meter an he never
raised the pressure his voice had the ex-
quisite changes produced by an angry child
assaulting his fathers wooden leg

   it was all along o my fathers uncle
naboth who made half a million dollars

staying home to germany while the rest of
the family got poor coming to america an
never got rich when they got here some
five years since he felt lie was beginning to
get old so he writ over to my dad that he
lowed it was his intention that i should
heir his wealth but he would like to see
me before he died

   however hed heeard that i wasnt fitten
to travel alone an was a hoodoo in com-
pany so he reckoned hed just ask his
brother or one of his two sisters to run over
to germany an take my picture along an
then maybe hed be content to die

  aunt johanna lowed that hed likely
be moren content to die after hed seen it
she only feared that he might commit sui-
cide though i couldnt see no sense in what
she said

   anyhow she lowed shed make the trip
an as shed been contemplating making a
visit to the old country she figured shed
take her whole family seeing as uncle
nabe was payin the freight

   i reckon it was one of them female
aunts that must have driv it into the old
man about me bein so ontrustworthy to
travel because them an pop too being
just as bad as me i couldnt see why i
shd be singled out nless that was it

  of course their reasons was to sour the
old man on me in favor of their own off-
spring which was all young an childish
dad bein ten years the aunts seniors

   well nobody objected we lowed that
if aunt johanna an her husband an her
seven children could get to germany they
was the only nine members of the family
that could get there barrjn them thatd
never left an nobody cd see what anybody
cd do about it

   dad said it was all right an so long
as they were going to take a picture of me
they might as well take a good one so he
lowed hed trust em with the big crayon
portrait in a frame in the parlor aunt
johanna confessed that she didnt want the
responsibility of that work of art but dad
said

   johanna i cn see clear through you
youre not goin over there with them seven
offshoots o yourn without takin somethin
thatll do my boy justice in the eyes of
uncle -nabe an its that or its nothin

   aunt johanna took one look at the
crayon an she said

   i reckon it just about does do him
justice carl it bout looks like him i
catching the boat



hadnt thought about that before ill be
mighty glad to take it along

  she laughed but i couldnt see nothin
to laugh at neither could dad he just
pulled his whiskers an lowed that barrin
an unfortunate looseness in catching trains
he was as smart as they made em yet

  well they got their tickets for land
an sea an thev put the clock two days an

half an hour ahead an they started for
the deepo in plenty of time

  but on the way cousin willie cast a
shoe cos hed developed an ingrowing nail
an before they cd persuade him to walk
or be carried without him busting a blood
vessel doggone me if they didnt hear the
engine whistle

  aunt johanna grabbed an offspring
under each arm but one of em slipped out
onto his nose an uncle ben tumbled over
him an the- was all down to once the
train went away they waited for the next
which was due four hours later an was
four hours late but they caught it

   when they got to washington they
found theyd left the crayon portrait of me
somewhere an it took three hours to trace
it then the feller said itd take two more
hours to get it an that there was a train
to new york every hour an they cd catch
the second one

  aunt johanna wanted to see the presi-
dent an the congressman what had -kissed

little freddie last year they didnt see
em but they missed the train they got
the next

   the conductor told em theyd just make
it from the ferry to the dock if the horse-
cars was running all right the cars was
all right but a horse died in the car they
was in

   the man said they often did that
though this horse hadonly one leg an one
ear dead that morning an he had trusted
him to go right through the day he seemed
disappointed

  well they rushed onto the dock just as
the hands was starting to haul in the gang-

the old man come to
himself and yanked
out his timepiece


the railroad mans magazine

plank there was a gap between it an the
boat already an she was swingin away

 uncle ben gave a yell an picked little
freddie up in his arms ran up the gang-
plank an jumped he landed all right
then he turned an sang out to aunt to-

ll	anna 

  throw em up johanna 
throw em up 

aunt johanna thought that was
how people got onto steamboats so
she picked up little william swung
him an slung him but willie was
always a cross-grained little cuss an
he fell short an dumped into the
river

when uncle ben seen it he gave
another yell an dove he got willie
all right being a good swimmer
but both of em was wet an they
missed the boat an little freddie was
on board

aunt johanna began to scream
but a man came up an told her theyd
send him back with pontius pilate or
somebody she screamed some more
at that but the feller explained who
pilate was an she guessed itd be
all right so she just gave willie a
lickin for missin the boat an later
on she gave freddie a licking for
catching it an then they came home

well after that aunt frieda
   lowed shed go to germany herself
   what business had two fools with
   seven kids monkey-
   ing with time-ta-
   bles an upsetting
   ever y body  she
   reckoned that her
   an the twins an
   tommy was just
   the right size of a
   party an right ap-
   peal to sentimenta-
   lize unde nabe to
   a frazzle

   we never lieeard
a great deal about
aunt friedas trip
we know she tried
for two days to
catch a train here
an then she only
got one by sleeping
all night at the
deepo anyhow her
an the twins an
tommy slipped
back into boolaboo
before a week was gone everybody ex-
pected it so nobody said nothin to em
except ma went over to borrow a sad-iron
an she said she noticed that little tommy
stood up all the time an seemed to prefer it
catching the boat



  aunt frieda brought the crayon portrait
back in a day or two an handed in her
resignation without explaining but i bribed
tommy back of the woodshed to tell me all
about it i bribed him with the promise of
a knife but i reckoned afterward that he
didnt need no knife

  well it seemed that tommy had been
reading all bout new york an he lowed
he wanted to see these streets what was
made of tenderloin worsen he wanted to go
to germany so he stowed hisself away on
a ferry-boat an they dragged most of the
north river an the bay for him an dis-
covered nothin but several other corpses
that didnt belong to tommy an one or
two disused ballot-boxes but nothin of no
value

  then tommy went to sleep an when
he woke up he had pins an needles in his
arm an he didnt know where he was an
before he cd remember he began to holler

 mommer  mommer   and they found
him

   the boat was just docking from the
sixth trip since tommy disappeared aunt
frieda yanked him out an dashed up the
gangway without delay a man said she
could make it if she run she run the
twins floated aunt frieda swinging em
through the air an only letting em touch
the ground every hundred yards tommy
brought up the rear still looking for tender-
loin

  when they rushed onto the dock the
distance to the steamer was too wide to
jump an it was gettin wider tommy
found the tenderloin he had it with him
when he got home

  well ma an dad sat in front of that
crayon portrait of me for a long time that
eveing-holding hands-dad pulling his
whiskers an ma crying soft

    ma said dad  that there gem of art
shall go to germany to comfort uncle nabe
an to do justice to our son

      i wish i cd think so dad said ma
 but somethin tells me the boy aint goin
to heir that wealth how can we get it
there  

      i will take it myself

  ma screamed you cannot go alone
dad she said

     we will go together you an me said
dad an they draped the crayon portrait of
me an went to bed

   i reckon dad might have made itj if
hed left ma at home first she discovered

that the train they were to leave boolaboo
on was no  an she wouldnt take it
it turned out after that it was the 
they waited for the next which was two
hours late but theyd given themselves lots
of time an when they arrived at new york
they had three hours to spare

  they went for a walk an bimeby they
came to a round building which everybody
seemed to be goin in free so they went
along thinking to get their moneys worth

  well it was a fish orphanage or
somethin there was fishes without noses
an fishes with bottle noses an fishes with
noses four feet long an fishes that changed
color an some thatd stare at you all day
without ever changing color or wincing

  they were sure entertained an when
the old man come to himself an yanked
out his timepiece the boat had been due
out some ten minutes an they were half an
hour away from the dock

  they didnt say a word to each other
they just turned right around an come
back to boolaboo supper was ready for
em an nobody said a word about it for
three days

  then dad said to me  son it seems
like heaven intends you should go your-
self

  i asked the old man if he was sure of
his authority an he claimed he was so i
bought me a new suit an the family knitted
me ties an socks an sewed my name an
address from my hat to my shoes an i
started off with a suit-case an the crayon
portrait of me

  well it was too bad when i got half-
way i remembered that id forgotten my
pipe but as id give myself plenty of time
i went back for it id got nearly to the
station again when i discovered that i put
the crayon portrait down to pick my pipe
up so i had to go back again i missed
the train i got one though later on

  at washington i had to change an
somehow i got half-way to florida before
i found out i was in the wrong train i
got out an went back

   i had to wait an hour at washington
but i did get a train an if i hadnt got
on a tug instead of the ferry-boat i low
id a got that steamer

  a feller asked me what i wanted an
i lowed i wanted to go to germany he
admitted they wasnt goin any further than
staten island-an they didnt he said
the fare for passengers was ten dollars but


the railroad mans magazine

the steamer was too wide to jump an it was

gettjn wider

i lowed that fifty cents would do him an
he said it would

  two policemen showed me how to get
back they bought tickets for me on the
railroad an another ferry they said
they cd get em cheaper than me an they
got me right across the island for two dol-
lars

  well i heard the boat tooting as i
came up to the dock an i was determined
by this time to get it i jumped over two
trucks an a feller selling vilets an dashed
on as she was swingin off

  by this time uncle nabe had heeard of
most of the attempts an i knew hed be
relying on me the boat was slipping
away an so was my chance at uncle
nabes half a million there was just one
way i might catch it i climbed on a crowd
of piles thinking i might make the jump
from them to the boat but by the time i
got there she was well out an i was just
makin up my mind to swim after her when
a boys voice hailed me

  hey mister he yelled are you
lemuel schmidt 

  i am said i waiting to dive

    heres a telegram for you 

   it was from dad

     uncle nabe says hell bet me a hun-
dred thousand dollars to a nickel youll be
only one to catch the boat better miss it
dad

  thats what it said an i sorter agreed
with the old man that a hundred thousand
here was bettern half a million hereafter
i came home

  sad schmidt paused

   did you get the hundred thou   i
asked

   i shouldve done stranger but there
was one feller that didnt miss a boat it
went from hamburg to australia an the
feller was the cashier in uncle nabes bank
an now we are takin turns in keeping
uncle nabe theres the whistle of the
eight-oclock i reckon you wont get it

  i didnt i ran to the station just like
the whole schmidt family had done but i
didnt get it i have never got one since
without first missing from one to ten

  im a hoodooed an demoralized ish-
mael but now that ive got this yarn out
of my system maybe the hoodoo is lifted

         like a soothin anesthetic-

         dont it drowse you like a peaceful lullaby

                     oh its spin spin spin

                   and its work like sin

for were racing with the seconds and theyve got a show to win

by sam henry

 i he true story series nearly every raw recruit who
a joins the great army of railroaders has to take his share of ridicide
from the old-timers sometimes however the fun goes a little too
far and unless some kind-hearted veteran steps in and takes sides with the
new man life is apt to prove anything but a bed of roses that mr henry
is still a clerk in uncle sams mail service was due to an eagle-eye  putting
him wise  and helping him to call the bluff of a certain conductor turn
about is fair play

true story number fifty-six

a little diama enacted in a mail-car by several trainmen and a dog
which was suddenly brought to an unexpected

climax

jt was not long after my appoint-

i

     ment as a relief mail clerk with
     headquarters at houston texas
     that one of uncle sams mail-
     sorters running from bremond
     to cisco was suddenly taken
     with what the chief clerk called the home
     fever and i was sent to relieve him

  you have seen pictures of a reuben
coming to town  well such picturesmight
have been taken from real life of me at that
time about the only thing i had ever trav-
eled on was a texas bronco just eighteen
years old right from the forks of the creek
 was as green as they make em in
fact i have often wondered how i ever got
to bremond one hundred and fifty miles
from houston without an escort

  when i started out from bremond on
my first run i noticed at each station that
the conductor and baggage-master kept hold-
ing a consultation of some sort and often
glanced in my direction i was too guile-
less to suspect anything however though i
made the trip to cisco wondering all the
way what they had been talking about
returning the next day we were only about
thirty minutes out when the conductor
opened my partition door and seeing me
apologized for intruding saying that he
thought his friend edgar was on

  it seemed that some one had given the
conductor a very valuable dog at cisco and
he had come to ask edgar to allow him to
leave it by the stove on some mail sacks until
we got to waco his division point wish-

when the con was called



ing to be agreeable i insisted that he bring
his dog in anyhow and i stopped ray work
to help him tie the animal giving him every
assurance that it would be well taken
care of

  in about twenty minutes after the con-
ductor left the partition door was again
opened-this time by a portly gentleman
well-dressed in a prince albert coat and
having all the earmarks of a western law-
yer he seemed greatly surprised as the
conductor had been on seeing me there and
also made profuse apologies-for disturbing
me saying that he had thought his friend
edgar was in the car

don has several masters

  edgar he said was a fine fellow and
everybody liked him then his eye fell
upon the dog

  why thats not you don he cried
whereupon the old dog got up and wagged
his tail  that is don how did that dog
get there mr mail clerk

  he then told me that early that morning
and before starting to the train he had sent
this very dog which belonged to him to
school with his little girl as the dog was
never known to leave her he felt certain that
something terrible must have befallen his
child when the dog had been taken away

   mr mail clerk he concluded  in
heavens name tell me quickly how do you
come to have my dog  

  i explained how the conductor had
brought him in to me the man ripped
and swore he informed me that he was
united states district judge and that he
would call the law down upon the one who
had stolen his little daughters protector

  i tried to pacify him telling him that
possibly the dog had strayed away and that
the conductor knowing his value wished to
take care of him he would not accept my
explanation however saying that the con-
ductor knew his dog and he was certain that
if he had seen him at the depot he would
have sent him home instead of bringing him
away finally he left stating that he was
going to have it out with the conductor

  i felt very uneasy expecting serious
trouble between them directly they came
to my car together the conductor seemed
angry and denied knowing anything about
the dog other than that he had seen me lead-
ing him down to the car and he had noticed
that i had a hard time getting him in to

substantiate this remarkable story he brought
in the baggage-master

accused of a crime

  the judge became angrier than before
he went into a long rigmarole about what
the law would do to me since i had been
caught redhanded with every witness against
me and ended with the cheerful information
that he was a personal friend of president
arthur and would see that i lost my job
he would leave the dog with me until we
reached waco when an officer would take
charge of me

  knowing that i was innocent of wrong-
doing yet accused of a crime and with no
one to defend me i dont believe any one
was ever more miserable than i at that
moment rather than face the disgrace of
arrest i had about made up my mind to
abandon the train at the brazos river when
i heard a knock on the door next to the
engine i opened it and found the engineer
standing outside

  he had a good-natured face that made me
feel better at once he came in and walked
over to the stove where the dog lay

  well don he said you are a great
old rascal then he turned to me  say
buddy dont look so downhearted them
galoots are only playing a joke on you that
conductor and baggage-master are forever
up to some monkey-shine now buddy if
you will carry out my instructions we will
give them a scare theyll remember and
maybe it will break them of playing jokes
don belongs to that conductor and he
wouldnt take a thousand dollars for him

    he can travel over the top of a string of
box cars as good as any braky and i dont
believe he has missed a trip with that con-
ductor in five years now i am going to
take don up on the engine where he is as
much at home as he is here you put a
lump of coal in this old gunny-sack and
just as i slow down at the river open the
partition door and holler to the baggage-
master  here goes that dog

the eagle-eyes plan

    it will be so dark he cant tell what it is
you are throwing out but when he looks
around in your car and finds the dog is gone
he will run back to the coaches to tell the
conductor you had better bolt the door
because that con is going to be some mad


the railroad mans magazine

let them pound on it until they break it
down if need be but dont let them in i
will be back as soon as i can get don out
of sight

  i could have hugged the engineer for tell-
ing me it was all a joke and was only too
glad to carry out his instructions

  as we slowed down for the river i opened
the partition door and yelled to the baggage-
master here goes that dog ill get that
much of the evidence out of the way

  the baggage-master came to my door
looked in and seeing don was gone ran
back for the conductor i bolted the door
as i had been told to do and in about a
minute i heard such a pounding as no door
would stand very long the engineer soon
returned however and telling me to stand
aside he jerked open the door in rushed
the conductor the baggage-master and the
judge the conductor made a jump for me
but the engineer caught him and i never
heard such a  rolling  as he gave all three
of them

   you ought to be clubbed he said
 you have tantalized this kid all day un-
til you have driven him to desperation and
now hes gone and thrown your dog into
the river i was looking back just now and
i saw something go over so i came to see
what it was

   the kid wouldnt tell me much about
it but as i am on to your pranks i am
certain it was don dont you fellows know
that this lad can have every last one of you
arrested for interfering with the united
states mails that door is cracked where
you tried to break in and if he prefers

charges against you i will appear as a wit-
ness for him

  after this little speech the conductor
cooled down considerably and after further
thought on the matter he became very pleas-
ant and even tried to get chummy with me
he was broken up over the loss of his dog

  at our next stop he wired back to the
agent at fowler to hunt up the section-boss
who was a friend of his and to tell him
that when the train hit the curve at brazos
river don who had been standing close to
the door had fallen out the section-boss
was to go to the river and look for the dog
he should have five dollars for his trouble
and if he found him ten dollars more

  when we arrived at waco the end of
the division the conductor came round to
try to persuade me not to report him while
he was talking the engineer appeared with
don and the expression on that conductors
face certainly was a surprised one

  he was so glad to get his dog back that
he took both of us to a restaurant and
bought us a fine dinner he begged us to
keep the story quiet for he said that he had
been guilty of so many pranks along his
run that if this were found out everybody
would have the laugh on him so we prom-
ised not to give him away

  the tale got out somehow in the course
of time and for quite a while whenever
this conductor would hit a station he would
be asked if he had found his dog yet it
even got to some of the officials and a wag-
gish despatcher after issuing an order to
him would often supplement it with the
question have you found old don

duties of a fireman

the fireman has certain duties to perform in
connection with firing the engine besides
the actual putting in of coal or feeding the boiler
with water on a great many railways these
duties are specified by the working rules and
regulations the filling of oil-cans getting stores
sweeping of the deck and wiping off the engine
or cab though tending to show a man to be clean
and tidy through attention to these duties it is
not always the case that such a man will prove
good fireman of course the getting of stores
cleaning of lamps and torches and the gathering
up of tools such as coal-pick scoop broom etc
are all very necessary items that a fireman must
look after or be up against trouble on the road
jt is of  use giving advice on this part of his

duties because if any failure of his to do these
things was the means of lost time or complaint
his services would soon be dispensed with the
examination of dampers and grates on the modem
locomotive is out of the question on an engine
turned out ready for the train the dampers are
no longer under the control of the fireman as
the engine gets its supply of air above the ash-
pan near the bottom of the fire-box but there
is no doubt that it would assist a fireman greatly
in his work of firing if he were to make a pret-
ty close examination of the coal on the tender
also note the condition of the fire to see whether
it is clean or not or if it is clinkered and this

by w t percival

             there are times when a man would give
             his kingdom for much less than a horse

synopsis of previous chapters

baker a noted desperado has held up the pacific coast special relieving it of bills amounting
to  he makes his escape from the posse following him steering his way for the arid
and desolate bad lands where he hopes to hide himself coming to a little settlement of
deserted huts he takes possession of one and after investigating his surroundings finds he can stay
comfortably in seclusion there until the hunt for him has subsided he is startled one morning
however by seeing a man coming down the trail

chapter v

 good morning mr standish 

baker stood his ground and let
the stranger approach in-
 wardly he cursed himself for
i having ventured away from
his shack unarmed it was a
mighty foolish thing for a
man in his predicament to do but he had
felt so very sure of himself that-

  this was  time for pondering over er-
rors made it was a time for bluff baker
was facing the approaching man who hav-
ing gained the hillside that led down to the
deserted camp now started on a trot baker
faced about and waited

  not a muscle in his well-knit frame trem-
bled he waited until the stranger was with-
in fifty yards of him and then he whipped
his right hand to his hip-pocket and let it
remain there

  the action was not without its desired
effect baker expected that his visitor would
pull some sort of new-fangled weapon and
let fly at him instead he came to a sud-
den halt threw up his hands and cried

   dont shoot 

  baker did not remove his hand from his
hip-pocket

   dont shoot repeated the stranger  i
mean you no harm

began in the april railroad mans

  then come down easy like command-
ed baker his right hand in the same po-
sition  come down easy like and keep
your hands where they are

  the stranger did as he was ordered
baker noticed that he was a youngish
man-perhaps not more than six and twen-
ty-with a sturdy frame bright-blue eyes
and long yellow hair his face wore the
queer brown tan that quickly marks the
blond men who seek the out-of-door life he
seemed possessed of a pleasant manner-in-
deed the sunny disposition of the easily con-
tented rippled in smiles over his good-look-
ing face notwithstanding the stern demands
of the desperate man who stood before him

  he came down until he almost faced ba-
ker and baker said

  now walk ahead of me go into that
cabin at the foot of this path-and we will
talk it over go ahead-dont turn around
or i will not be responsible for my actions
he did exactly as the desperado ordered
walking straight ahead looking neither to
the right nor the left with a lithe step he
entered the maison de baker

  the lord of the manor quickly followed-
his trusty right hand on his hip-pulled up
a chair to the table and ordered the visitor
to be seated

  this formality over baker lost no time
in annexing his six-gun the newcomer
saw this operation and smiled

the railroad mans magazine

   only a bluff-that little game outside-
eh  he said

  im taking  chances replied baker
 keep your hands upon the table thats
it spread em out now who are you  
 how about your putting your hands on
the table too said the other lets
make it horse and horse

   ive got the drop replied baker with
a calmness that was more forcible than any
gun-play thats nine-tenths of the law
now who are you

  at first dick standish was not prepared
to say he too was in deep disgrace for
a moment lie pictured the card-room in
keeleys the particularly brilliant cafe of
dunstans corners some fifty miles back
in the wilderness where among the gold-
diggers he was known as the slickest card-
sharp of them all

  he saw the gold and silver and chips
on the table he recalled the card that lie
had deftly palmed from the discard to
fill his hand he remembered big decker
jumping up and accusing him he remem-
bered having pulled his gun the flash the
heavy thud of deckers body as it struck
the floor the upturned table the scattered
cards and money-and the dash for free-
dom that he made through the back door
with the smoking revolver still in his hand

  he could still hear the men shouting as
he mounted the first horse he saw and rode
into the night the scurrying hoofs of his
pursuers were still fresh in his ears just
how he had finally outwitted them he did
not know all he hoped for was that he
was safe from the clutches of the law
who are you baker repeated
pardner i wouldnt like to tell-not
just now-if you dont care

  he smiled-and baker seemed to begin
to understand that smile this man was
either a fugitive from justice or a detec-
tive on his trail

   i am unarmed standish went on  i
havent so much as a cartridge on me i
am willing that you should search me

   thats a queer way to be mousin
around these diggins aint it asked
baker

  like as not standish replied but
it just happens that im without irons

   usually carry em eh  

   ive owned some good ones

  why did you come here

  standish didnt answer for a moment
lie looked at baker keenly and then said

    ill be perfectly square with you tell
  me who you are and ill tell you who
  i am

    baker was too old a bird to be caught by
  such reasoning his reply was this ques-
  tion 

 - posse after you

    standish looked quizzically

    baker seemed to lfave waited an age
 before the voung man answered

    not that i know of

     he who hesitates falls into the trap 
  was writ large in the lexicon of baker

    there was or there had been a posse
 after this man now to learn the reason
 why

     whats your specialt--limited trains
  or grub-wagons   asked baker

    dick standish saw that it was useless to
 parley further

    he took a long breath and then purged
 his conscience with the awful truth

    murder he said with set features
  i killed-my man

    oh the great glory of being able to say
   my man 

    standish leaned back as if he were a
 real hero he had sprung a bond of sym-
 pathy he thought that would easily wind
 its tentacles in the heart of his inquisitor
 but he had not reckoned the cold calcula-
 ting keen analytical baker in whom sym-
 pathy was the last sentiment to be
 aroused

    just at that moment dick standish ex-
 pected many things to happen he did not
 anticipate however the bloodless question
 diat was immediately hurled at him by
 baker in the one word

   where 

    it was too much for standish he had
 looked for sympathy he had been handed
 a stone

    he jumped to his feet a deep furrow
 wrinkled his fair brow anguish distorted
 his face he clenched his fists and stepped
 back baker did not move from the chair
 in which he was sitting he just tapped
 the handle of his six-gun in the most idle
 unconcerned manner and let it go at that

   who are you why do you want to
 know come-this isnt fair shouted
 standish

     dont get excited my boy said baker
  still unmoved

    if youre a detective out with it im
  unarmed i tell you i havent any shoot
  in-irons on me 
baker of the bad lands



  he seemed to be working himself into a
frenzy and the calmer baker remained the
more excited became the younger man

   if youll just cut that out come down
to facts and tell me who you are we will
be able to reach an understandin quicker
said baker im not a detective-if that
will do you any good

  oh thank you--thank you the
younger man cried in a great burst of
anguish

  he would have thrown himself on bakers
body out of sheer joy had not that worthy
rudely pushed him off

   sit down now baker said with a
sternness that brooked of no refusal sit
down and behave yourself or ill have you
doin a dance to the music of this har-
monica and he tapped his six-shooter
with force

  standish sat down as he did so he
wiped the tears from his eyes they were
there sure enough even the heart of the
highwayman is bound to quake under the
strain of trouble

  baker waited until the young man had
sniffled back a few sobs and then he put
his pointed question with all the cleverness
and directness of a trained lawyer examin-
ing a witness

  who are you and where did you come
from  

  the other braced his back for the or-
deal he hesitated just a moment to decide
whether he would tell the truth straight and
untarnished or tinge the story with false-
hood

  perhaps it would be best to color the
distressing narrative that the armed man
across the table might not know that he
was so desperate a character but as he
looked straight into the eyes of baker he
thought he saw a friendliness a comrade-
ship that he had not observed before

chapter vi

bakers greatest problem

yyick standish told his story he
told it straight and true he minced
no words he omitted no details he made
it as picturesque and dramatic as he knew
how and he did his best to let baker think
that he was not so much to blame-that the
shooting was partly justifiable

  baker listened without interruption not
once during the recital of the narrative did

    	rr

he ask a question not once did he endeavor
to help the young man when he came to a
halting spot but when dick standish bad
come to the last chapter-where he ap-
peared on the horizon of the deserted camp
-baker wanted to know no more with a
suddenness that brought the young man up
with a start he asked

  why did you come here

   this is where they all come to said
standish

  if he had been very quick he would
have seen a faint a very faint smile play
around the corners of bakers mouth so
they all come here had he then found
only a hovel that was known to every high-
wayman of the plain-had he put up at a
deserted hole known to every outlaw as a
safe place in which to hide

  no-it could not be the young man
must be mistaken however the words
took root in bakers mind it brought a
feeling of uneasiness to him many times
that afternoon and night

   so you are dick standish   said
baker

  yes replied the other do you
know me  

  arent you the chap who tried to pull
off a case down at quincys a year ago-
the night they brought a shipment of gold
from the east for the bank there  

  standish hesitated long enough to give
baker a chance to answer for him baker
did so in these words

   you made a bull of that job all right
 i should have got away with it stan-
dish answered

  if you hadnt been a kid you would
have got away with it it was a fool trick
for you to butt in where an older man
would have made his getaway-and with
the gold

  standish did not answer it was appar-
ent that baker knew him the outlaw does
not care to go into a history of his past or
a recitation of his deeds of daring no mat-
ter how clever they may be unless he knows
that the man who is listening is one of his
kind

  he sat sullenly for some moments the
picture of sheer desperation now he would
look at baker with a despairing glance
now he would scan the distance through the
open door of the cabin as if wondering
just how he could transform himself to the
realms that lay beyond the serried whiteness
of the bad lands


the railroad mans magazine

   at any rate he and baker could not re-
main in the same place unless it was to be
on a plane of equality he had told baker
the untarnished truth about himself and
now it was up to baker to reveal his iden-
tity

  standish was not a coward he had not
shed tears during the narrative of his life
through fear or cowardice he shed them
because he was at the mercy of an armed
man if standish had been in possession
of the pistol-if he had even been armed
as baker was-we would have had a much
different story to record

   standish was the first to speak

  now tell me who you are

  he asked the question too abruptly-
rather too seriously he had adopted ba-
kers tactics of examination

  the question didnt worry baker in the
least instead of replying he started to
quiz standish about the abandoned camp
which both had selected as a refuge

   what do you know about this place 

  its called gull city replied standish
t ever been here before 

   many years ago-when i was a little
fellow my father came here with the gold
fever wesettled in this place but there
was nothing doing

    where is your father now  

  the young outlaw smiled and shook his
head

  all i remember he said was that
we vere loaded in a prairie wagon and by
the time that we came to some place out in
wyoming he left me to shift for myself i
havent heard fuom him since

   untouched still baker went on

   you remarked that this place-gull
city-is pretty well known as a hiding-
place for-such as you  

    you dont mean to tell me that you have
never heard of it 

    i guess nobody knows these parts any
better than i do said baker  and i never
heard of this place

  why said standish  whenever any
of the boys makes a getaway he usually
hikes for gull city it was the first place
that i thought of

    if its so well known said baker
arent the sheriffs wise

  they havent found it yet why them
two fellers that robbed a bank down in the
southern part of the state hung around here
for two years before they appeared then
they were forgotten

  baker said no more he only thought

  again there was silence both men were
occupied in some mental scheme baker was
wondering just what he would do with stan-
dish it would not do to drive him from the
place

  it was evident that he knew too much
about it and baker was not so certain that
standish could be trusted if he were sent
abroad and captured he might in a spirit
of revenge tell where baker was hidden-
and baker had to hide

  the shooting of a man in a mining-town
over a card-game was of little consequence
when compared with the hold-up of one
of the fastest trains in the west stan-
dishs crime would blow over in a few
months bakers would be the talk of keen-
witted sleuths spurred on for months and
years perhaps by the monstrous reward for
his body-dead or alive

  no he couldnt afford to send standish
away indeed he couldnt even afford to
let him go away of his own accord he
would have to keep him there-welcome or
unwelcome friend or foe

  if it were elected that standish was to
be his sole companion in that lonesome ag-
gregation of huts and tin cans what would
lie do with the twenty thousand dollars
would it be safe could he trust standish
with his secret

   would he dare to leave it out of his sight
for even a second  would-great thunder
-would he even dare to go to sleep at night
might not standish kill him and make away
with that glorious fortune

  and why shouldnt he thought ba-
ker wouldnt i do the same

  men had been killed for a less sum than
that

  yes standish was a problem the more
baker thought it over-with his hand on his
gun and his eyes running the blond mans
length from hair to toe-the more his prob-
lem narrowed down to two factors first
he must make standish his bosom pal or
second he must kill him

  by the code that guided him baker dis-
liked more than all else to take a human
life unless there was good and sufficient
reason he knew the art of maintaining
his position and keeping the upper hand
of a situation with a pistol within reach-
just as he was doing at this particular mo-
ment-but he would rather have shared his
twenty thousand with standish and let him
go his way than spill his blood
baker of the bad lands	

   the soul of baker was not the soul of a
coward it was guided merely by certain
psychological inconsistencies - phases of
mental convolutions that are found in all
criminals unto whom one crime is right and
another crime is wrong

  while baker was trying to solve this
problem standish was thinking of one thing
only

  who was baker

        chapter vii
        to pass the night

c tandish arose and asked for a drink
 baker pointed to the tin bucket which
he kept filled with water from the spring
standish picked it up and let a long draft
trickle down his throat he set the bucket
on the floor paced to and fro for a moment
went over to the door and looked out as
lie leaned against the door-jamb with his
hands stuck deep into his pockets baker
took him in from a new angle

   there appeared to be a streak of kindness
in the young man around his eyes and
about his mouth were evidences of a better
breeding than usually comes to the average
outlaw he had something of a kindly ex-
pression something of genuine sincerity in
his face and manner

  perhaps if he had not been deserted by
a god-forsaken unlucky father-perhaps
if he had had a chance to grow up among
good men and had not been left to the
desperadoes of a forgotten country for his
mental guidance-he might have become a
good man with decent prospects thn more
baker studied him the more he became con-
vinced that he could trust him-to a certain
point

   standishs blue eyes took in the tiresome
vista that he hated beyond words until it
all seemed a mockery he wished that some-
thing might happen to blot it out of his
sight forever  he wondered if beyond its
creamy expanse which-the hot sun seemed
to be making all the more disheartening
there wasnt some place where a man might
live and be good-where he might go and
wipe the sins from his soul and start life
anew

    say standish

  baker spoke it was not in the sharp
brutal tone to which the other man had be-
come accustomed the words were rather
pleasantly uttered-for baker

   standish turned quickly the smile of
 boyish friendship played on his face he
 looked inquiringly

    sit down old man

   as baker spoke he picked up his gun
 and thrust it between his trousers and shirt

   standish returned to the table he felt
 that he would not have to ask the question
 that was uppermost in his mind again his
 first impulse was to hold out his hand he
 craved friendship then as he had craved it
 only once before-when his father had
 driven away and left him to the mercy of
 the world

   standish took the seat across the table
 and waited for baker to proceed baker
 was eyer ready to place himself on the de-
 fensive he always managed to get in that
 position by asking questions instead of com-
 ing directly to the point

    did you ever hear of baker of the bad
 lands

   many times replied standish 

   pretty bad record eh

    hes considered a daring man i would
 not like to come up against him

     well you are 

   baker almost jerked the words from his
 throat before standish had time to think

   standish his mouth wide with surprise
 looked into the face of the most noted out-
 law of the time-the man whom he fre-
 quently had admired in secret whom he
 wondered if it would ever be his good for-
 tune to see little did he dream that the
 meeting would be in such a place and under
 such conditions

   you havent heard of me for some
 time baker continued

   no it was thought that you were out
 of the country

   i was-out of the country but i am
 back again its a long story standish and
 i am going to tell you all about it you are
 here and i cant afford to let you go first
  of all let us shake hands we are both des-
 perate men im an old lad at the game

     ive been through a score of battles and
 have come out with two things to my credit
 i am well over forty and i have never
 killed a man-yet secondly i have never
 been shot myself there isnt a scar on my
 body

    you are only a youngster-hot-headed
 foolish romantic and you play for small
 stakes your kind stays a baby all through
 life and youre in this game because-well
 you gave the secret out yourself-your fa-
	the railroad mans magazine

 tlier deserted you and you were forced into
 it youre brave all right but i wouldnt
 trust you standish

   im giving it to you straight from the
shoulder and you must take it i wouldnt
trust you in the little scheme that i have in
mind

   while you and i are here it will be
necessary for you to abide by certain re-
strictions-and always remember that this
will never get beyond my eye or arm

   so said baker as he again tapped the pro-
truding handle of his six-gun

  standish eyed him with mixed curiosity
and pride

    ive got twenty thousand dollars here
baker continued he walked to and fro
and spoke with slow and peculiar delibera-
tion now and then pressing his hand against
that side of his body where the stolen money
rested in its leathern case

   you neednt worry where i got it
think whatever you please some day i
may make up my mind to tell you but rest
assured that it is here and in the kind of
currency that goes anywhere

   i came here because i was driven here
i propose to stay here until the snow flies
unless i am ousted by some objectionable
visitors it is a comfortable place it will
be pretty hot in summer but then we will
take it easy and will have to look only for
grub

   i have fixed up all this and baker
pointed with pride to the changes that he
had made in the old cabin and its comfort-
able appearance- and there is a lot more
that we can do to make it pleasant

  thank you-thank you said stan-
dish rising and holding out his hand

  baker interrupted him with a short ges-
ture

  not yet baker went on wait till i
have finished

  he went to the bucket refreshed himself
with a drink of water and then continued

   i have a proposition to make to you
standish if you are willing to stay here
with me until the snow flies if you will do
as i say and obey me strictly if you will
play a square game and act strictly on your
honor i will give you one thousand dollars
when we separate and you can go your
way

  standish made another effort to show his
appreciation but bakers hand silenced him

   there is one thing more-i will trust
you to a certain limit but beyond that you

must permit me to have my way during
the day i can keep you in sight and re-
member i will

   but i trust no man at night-not even
my own father no i wouldnt even trust
myself and baker brought his fist hard on
the table to emphasize the importance of this
assertion

   i havent the smallest grain of faith in
the highwayman at night continued baker
 i dont care how honest he claims to be by
daylight or how good a pal-at night hed
steal the pennies off a dead mans eyes i
aint mingled with em for years without
knowing em from the ground up

  there was a touch of resentment in the
face of standish baker noticed it and he
drove hometiis argument all the more for-
cibly

   yes id do it-and youd do it and
there aint a man who makes his living by
his wits who wouldnt do it in the day-
time lie is a good fellow-but at night i
wouldnt trust him with a cent

  now it conies to this standish ive
got to have sleep i cant sit up all night
watching you and all you might say about
being honest dont have any effect on me
while im asleep

   this is the thing that keeps you honest
my boy and once more he sharply patted
the butt of his gun- but once you get this
shootin-iron in your possession i wouldnt
give a cows hoof for your honesty or my
money or life

  i promise- broke in standish

   you promise nothing interrupted
baker

  standish was completely dumfounded in
his heart he was willing to be honest and
withstand temptation he would try hard to
do so but he couldnt help wondering
just what baker intended to do with him at
night

chapter viii

something missing

d aker paced the floor of the cabin for
 some moments his arms were fold-
ed-but his right hand was on the handle of
the instrument that was die real master of
the situation

  he was in deep thought-he was plan-
ning the manner in which his partner by
force would be obliged to pass his nights

  standish sat playing with his fingers now
baker of the bad lands



looking at the floor now looking at the erect
lithe figure of the thinking man he wanted
to speak he wanted to assure baker with
all the fervor he possessed that he would
do just as baker said-and that he would
be a good little boy at night

   did you get away with any of that mon-
ey in that poker mix-up baker asked
with his customary abruptness

    not a cent said standish  the table
was knocked over and i had just time to
get away

  how much was in the pot

   about three hundred

   how much in cash  

  nearly all of it

  and you were cheating

   standish didnt quite like or quite under-
stand the force or-the necessity of this cross-
examination

  for a moment it angered him one more
question like that he thought and he would
spring at the throat of baker bang his head
against the wall and get possession of the
pistol and the money

  what right had this man who would not
account for his own ill-gotten gains to be so
inquisitive and lordly but these were only
flashes of thought the diplomatic side of
standish quickly got the upper hand of him
and he replied

   i admitted that when i told you my
story

  there was a touch of irony in his voice
that baker liked he sought no further
information from the younger man but after
a few seconds of silence he faced standish
and said in measured tones that there might
beno misunderstanding

    i am willing to carry out my part of the
agreement that i have just made if you are
willing to be tied up at night

   how   was all the surprised standish
managed to say

   i dont know baker answered  i
havent made up my mind yet i have to
figure that out it aint so easy as it seems
then he walked over to the door of the
cabin and looked out on the vegetable
garden

   standish he said  do you see that
stuff growing over in that corner with the
small white flowers

  standish walked over to the door and
looked in the direction indicated by bakers
finger

  thats potatoes baker went on  its
a pretty good patch at that but its kind

of choked with weeds you go over there
and pull the weeds out and throw them well
up the hill

  standish sauntered out to the patch of
potatoes and looked at the weeds with a
critical eye

  he smiled to think of being brought to
such work he had never done it before in
all his life if it hadnt been for the little
white blossoms on the plants he doubted if
he could have told which were potatoes and
which were weeds

   finally he got down on his knees and went
at the work with a will 

  baker sitting on the stoop watched him
intently for a while but he soon returned
to the question that was uppermost in his
mind even if standish declined his propo-
sition he would have to be made a prisoner
at night until some disposition could be
made of him

  it now seemed to be well toward the noon
hour and baker knew that whatever he did
would require the greater part of his time
before darkness fell whatever happened
he began to realize that he did not care to
sit up all night by the sleeping form of dick
standish

  baker arose and walked over to one of
the deserted cabins about a hundred feet
from his own it was one of the best of
the array of rotting hovels of gull city
baker had given it second choice when se-
lecting his abode he opened the door and
looked in that would do pretty well

  then he remembered that during his first
tour of investigation about the place he had
seen a rusty anvil in the middle of one of
the streets he recalled that when it first
met his gaze he had said it might come in
handy some day

  now he wandered about until he found it
again he leaned over to pick it up the
sun had turned it too hot for immediate
handling so he dragged it to a shady place
to let it cool finally he carried it without
much effort to the cabin which he had se-
lected as the  prison  in which standish
should spend his nights and set it in the
middle of the floor

  there he said to himself now if
i had a chain that could be run through
that hardy-hole and then fastened to stan-
dishs leg i would sleep at night-all right
all right

  and if the hardy miners who tried to
make gull city a populous and prosperous
center thought baker  left anvils and


the railroad mans magazine

stoves and tin buckets and all the things
that i have collected to make me comfort-
able they must have left a piece of chain
somewhere

  standish would soon find out

  returning to the vegetable garden baker
called to standish the latter who was still
on his knees working with a will that sur-
prised even himself popped to his feet and
smilingly responded

   standish said baker  i want a piece
of chain look around among these huts
and see if you can find about ten feet or
so-and not too heavy standish

  standish looked in the direction of the
dilapidated territory indicated by bakers
sweeping hand

  and when you find it standish bring
it to me i will be in that cabin and the
hand again indicated the objective point

  standish ambled away lazily baker re-
turned to the cabin there he stood in the
doorway and saw the younger man idly
kicking the dust with his feet now stooping
now picking up something now looking
about gingerly

  he roamed thither and yon and then dis-
appeared behind one of the cabins he must
have been out of sight for some fifteen min-
utes when he again appeared before ba-
ker he had about four feet of rusty wagon-
chain and a small dog-chain

  bakers eyes gleamed with joy as stan-
dish handed them over

  just the things exclaimed baker
where did you find them 

  standish was about to give a minute de-
tail of the success of his quest but evidently
baker did not care to hear

  he threw the chains to the floor

  now standish he went on here is
the point of my argument listen careful-
ly and let me know if you will agree

  he stopped as if to prepare the younger
man for a life sentence

   i will give you one thousand dollars
as i said under the previous conditions if
you will agree to remain in this cabin every
night with that anvil chained to your leg
i am to see that you are made fast to it
the last thing every night and i will release
you every morning

   i couldnt drag that very far said
standish as he viewed the makeshift oregon
boot with a smile  couldnt you make it
a little easier old man there was a
tinge of sadness in his voice  i will prom-

                                 t o be

 ise to live up to everything you ask your
 money will be safe with me

   standish said baker i wouldnt
 trust my own father in a game like this if
 he were here-and were a minister of the
 gospel-i would treat him in the same way
 i could not sleep at night unless you were
 chained up

     well said standish  if i prove to you
  that i am honest will you quit this game 
   that remains to be seen responded
  baker  but the chances are might slim
  remember standish-and i hate to keep
  telling you about it-i need my sleep

    for a moment there was silence stan-
 dish his hands on his hips looked at the
 formidable array of anvil and chains ba-
 ker looked at standish

     its agreed- said standish

   good replied baker and the two
 clasped hands to seal the deal

    as if guided by some hypnotic motive
 standish returned to the potato patch and
 bent over the weeds and succeeded in pull-
 ing up a few tomato-vines in the bargain

    baker turned his attention to the comple-
 tion of the oregon boot the heavier chain
 he ran through the hardy-hole of the rusty
 anvil bringing the two ends together he
 ran the dog-chain through the last link of
 each end at the one end of the dog-chain
 was a ring this served to form the end of a
 loop finally the boot was finished

    the two men had dinner as the sun was
 going down just as the last rays of twi-
 light were fading to the far shores of the
 night baker ordered standish to make
 ready some old bedding was gathered
 from the other cabins and placed on the
 floor a bucket of water anda chair were
 placed hard by all this was overlooked
 until the last moment and in the fast ap-
 proaching darkness it had to be done
 rather hurriedly

    when all was ready standish was ordered
 to sit down on the chair as he did so ba-
 ker picked up the unattached end of the
 dog-chain in one hand and reached for
 standishs leg with the other

    as he did so a queer look came into his
 face he drew back to the middle of the
 floor he was suddenly puzzled

    standish began to marvel at this change
 in his jailers attitude

    baker brushed tha cold sweat from his
 brow i cant make this work i must
 have a padlock

 a family railroad

by dennis h stovall

w s barnum and his two sons john and william fill every position
on the rogue river line from president
to track-walker

here is a family railroad out
in southern oregon-a rail-
road that pays big dividends
and which is not only owned
by one family but also oper-
ated by it in every department
from section boss to general manager it
is called the rogue river valley line
and it extends from medford to jackson-
ville medford is located on the main line
of the southern pacific railroad and jack-
sonville the county seat of jackson county
is six miles away

  jacksonville is the pioneer city of that
part of oregon and would have been a
point on the southern pacific had the neces-
sary bonus been forthcoming but the in-
habitants had got along for forty years
without a railroad and believed they could
do quite as well for another forty without
one they refused to raise the bonus and
the oregon and california railroad which
later became a part of the southern pacific
main line missed jacksonville by six miles
causing medford to spring into existence
which soon became the metropolis of south-
ern oregonbut jacksonville remains the
county seat in spite of every effort to re-
move it and the family railroad thrives
thereby

  the rogue river valley railroad does a
big business in passenger and freight traf-
fic besides carrying mail and express w

s	barnum and his two sons john and
william supply the necessary brain and
brawn to conduct the affairs of the entire
line and they have the business thoroughly
systematized the passenger-train-which
consists of two cars a passenger-coach and

a combination smoker baggage and ex-
press makes two round-trips daily con-
necting with the overland trains at medford

  the elder barnum is engineer william is
fireman and john is conductor brakeman
expressman baggageman and mail clerk
it would appear at first glance that john
has the hardest job on this train but as
the baggage is consigned straight through
and the express and mail is not distribu-
ted at way - points the major part of
his duties is that of punching tickets and
collecting fares

  between each trip of the passenger-train
which is called the  barnum flier a
freight-train goes over the road on which
the family fills the same relative positions
then there is still another  train  on this
line it is the  benzine special and con-
sists of a gasoline motor-car it is the first
over the line in the morning and the last
in the evening the motor-car was placed
primarily to carry mail but was soon found
a convenient method of getting to the county
seat at an early hour in the morning and
of leaving it in the evening after the regu-
lar train had left

  the construction department of this fam-
ily line is conducted as simply and econom-
ically as is the operating department at
odd minutes the older boy is shot over the
road  the motor-car stopping here and
there to slip a new tie under a rail or ham-
mer down a loose spike there is no wreck-
ing-train to replace derailed cars for when-
ever the  flier  or the  benzine special 
takes to the ditch the passengers are sup-
posed to give assistance in clearing the block-
ade and getting traffic moving again


the railroad mans magazine

  there is a depot at-each end of the line
where you purchase your ticket thirty min-
utes before the departure of each train
you cannot get it earlier because the
ticket-agent is also the conductor of the
train and has not arrived yet a local tele-
phone takes care of all train despatching
the conductor merely yelling in the receiver
just before starting were cornin

  the office-work is done by the father and
the boys in the evening after the trains are
run in for the night as there is no service
after dark on this road there are no idle
moments for the barnum family nowhere
on earth is there a harder working crew of
railroad men the three of them work not
because of absolute necessity for the line
is a paying business hut because they find
real enjoyment in it

  not long ago while the elder barnum
clad in overalls his face besmudged with
soot and grease was busy oiling the loco-
motive just before the flier made its
regular trip a curious passenger strolled up
and asked him in an offhand way why he
did not quit the railroad business and go to
farming

    theres more money in railroading the
engineer and general manager replied

  are you and your boys really making
wages the curious one asked

  oh yes fair wages was the answer
 we usually clean up five thousand a year

  it is doubtful if there is a railroad in
america that gives better returns in pro-
portion to the investment than this  fam-
ily  line the monthly balance-sheet would
make some capitalists envious and possibly
lead them to the belief that they have not
a complete monopoly on keeping the figures
nearly all on one side of the ledger

  the rogue river valley railroad was
built in  and has paid its owners from
 to s every year it has never
been tied up by snow blockades wash-outs
or strikes labor disturbances that are
often the terror of other railroad systems
do not interfere in the least with operations
on the rogue river valley line

  two things worry the barnums however
one is the fear that coal may get exor-
bitantly high and the other that their road
must ultimately become a central link in a
chain of railways across the state

freight-car held for a bird

pere marquette conductors secure permission to side-track domicil of

mother bird and little ones

five conductors of freiglit-trains in michi-
gan recently joined in a letter requesting
the division superintendent at saginaw to side-
track car no  they gave their reason

  when car no  left the repair-tracks at
muskegon after a period of enforced inactivity
and the  bad order  chalk-niark was removed
from its side door night switchman patrick
hawkins told conductor stark of train no 
that he wished the car could have remained a
little longer in the yard for a sparrow had built
a nest in the car and had a family of little birds
within conductor stark had no discretion in the
matter so the car was hauled to fremont

  when train xo si arrived at fremont the
mother bird was found riding on the top of it
sometimes flying above it and sometimes riding
upon the car the sparrow followed to white
cloud where the car became a part of train no
 but conductor stark told conductor bat-
tema about the bird and at big rapids where
the car was dropped conductor battema left
word with the trainmen about the sparrow

  conductor burritt hauled the car back to white
cloud leaving the door open a little so that the
sparrow could get in to her nest

   by the time the car returned to white cloud
 half the men on the railroad knew about it and
 conductor willoughby who hauled the car to
 baldwin in train no  was on the lookout
 for it and so was conductor hess who brought
 - the car to saginaw in train no  every con-
 ductor on the line by this time knew the number
 of car  as well as a part of the freight it
 carried

   there was not a man in the employ of the
 railroad who would have hurt the mother-bird
 or one of the little ones still it was a perilous
 life for the little mother and the young for the
 mother never flew away for a worm with any cer-
 tainty of finding her nest where she left it

   and so five railway conductors stark battema
 burritt willoughby and hess joined in a writ-
 ten report concerning the car and the family it
 contained and requested that the car be side-
 tracked until the little birds could fly

   vardmaster murray consulted the officers of
 the road and issued an order that car no 
 was not to be moved or molested until further
 orders that order held good till the young birds
 were able to take flight-prrc marquette monthly

he spat out the words vindictively

  thats all you can git he contin-
ued  whats more if i catch you hang-
ing round my nellie again ill break you
in two-unless jim wheelock sees you
first shes given her word to him and
he wont stand fer no sech fellers as you
trying to cut him out it takes a man
to do that beat it 

   instinctively campbell clinched his fists
then he thrust his hands into his pockets
pushed his cap onto the back of his head
and stared for a moment at the yard boss
without speaking

  he was a small man somewhat below
medium height with light hair and mild
blue eyes just now one of the latter was
badly discolored and a large livid bruise
marred his forehead

   i suppose ive got wheelock to thank
for this he remarked slowly looking the
yard boss full in the face  i knew he
was pretty low down but i didnt give
him credit for being able to drag you
to his level

  ive done my work all right havent
i  you know you havent any kick about
that healey just because i cant put up
my fists with that great hulking brute of

a bully you call me a coward and fire
me without a minutes notice

  come on now hit me if you like
he taunted recklessly as the other with
an inarticulate bellow started toward him
im not more than half your size-or
wheelocks its safe for either of you
to hit me-i cant hurt you  

  healey hesitated for a moment then
laughed contemptuously yet somewhat
shamefacedly

   i wouldnt touch you he sneered
wouldnt dirt- my hands on no such
carrion git out 

  yet youre willing to back wheelock
up in the dirty game he is playing flashed
campbell

  git out reiterated healey turning
from the door  i aint got no time to
argue with you

  campbell turned on his heel

  all right he flung over his shoulder
im going youre the boss-here but
if nellie dont want to see me she can tell
me herself im not going to quit on your
say so ill suit myself

  you will eh the doorway just
vacated by healey was suddenly filled by
the huge form of wheelock  well you
guess again  you keep away from nellie
or ill give you some more of the same
dope i handed you last night

  aint had enough yet nellies my
gal see she dont want nothing to do
with no down-and-out-

  here campbell was informed in detail as
to his pedigree his present status and his
future destination

  he made no reply indeed there is no
adequate retort that five feet five can make
to six feet three under certain circum-
stances notably when the latter is only too


the railroad mans magazine

ready to back up his arguments with a
pair of fists the size of hams

  followed by a stream of abuse camp-
bell left the yardsand walked moodily
down the track in spite of the unmistak-
able threats conveyed by wheelock and
healey he was determined to hear at first
hand what nellie had to say about the
matter the girl had always been kind to
him and he did not for a moment sup-
pose that she would concur in the estimate
her father and the engineer placed upon
him

  a few minutes brought him in sight of
the pretty cottage where of late many of
his evenings had been spent nellie was
sitting on the top step of the porch indus-
triously peeling some apples

  campbell opened the gate and at the
click of the latch the girl looked up for
an instant their eyes met then without
a word or a sign of recognition she picked
up the pan rose and entered the house

  nellie called campbell as she van-
ished within

  the door slammed behind her leaving
the young man standing on the gravel path
cap in hand speechless with astonishment
and dismay

  nellie too for an instant he could
not believe it of course her father had
told her of the occurrence of the night
before but that she should credit his
biased version of it without giving camp-
bell a chance to justify himself-to con-
demn him without a word-was a severe
blow to the young man replacing his
cap upon his head he slowly retraced his
steps to the railroad and turning to the
west started along the ties

  dully he wondered if fate had any more
thrusts in store for him he had received
a good education had been carefully
brought up in a small town in the middle
west and at the age of twenty-four hud
held a good position in the office of the
e and c in the city to which he had
gone from his western home

  he had lost this position through per-
sistent ill health and somehow since then
things had never gone right for him
everything seemed against him in league
to prevent his making a living when his
last cent was gone he had applied for
and secured the job of oiler in the freight-
yards of the e and c road

  he had been ashamed to let his parents
know of his misfortunes and feeling that

their resources had been strained to the
utmost to send him to the local liigh-school
and business college he had scorned to ask
any help but had plodded along alone
writing his usual cheerful weekly letter
there were times when he had gone hungry
to bed but this he kept to himself

  nellie healey had been the one bright
pot in his dull and almost hopeless daily
routine how sam healey had ever reared
such a daughter was beyond campbells
power of comprehension pretty gentle
and refined the contrast between her and
the big blustering man she called father
could hardly have been more pronounced

  a pleasant friendship had sprung up
between her and the young oiler and had
flourished until it had grown into a deeper
feeling on his part at least then his
visits had aroused the antagonism of jim
wheelock and he had stepped in and made
this as unpleasant for campbell as he
could

  the yard boss much preferred to see his
daughter receive the attentions of the best
freight engineer on the road and the man
who would some day in all probability
sit on the right side of no  the crack
passenger flier than those of a penniless
young man holding oneof the poorest-
paid positions on the pay-roll of the com-
pany with no prospects of anything better
in the future

  campbell had stubbornly refused to give
in with the result that wheelock had
picked quarrel after quarrel with him and
had announced his intention of  breaking
his face a threat which his superior size
and strength would have enabled him to
carry out with little exertion

  the bad feeling between the two men
fostered by wheelocks covert sneers and
open allusions to campbells lack of brawn
and initiative to say nothing of what
wheelock termed campbells  butting in 
at healeys had culminated in a war of
words ending in wheelocks planting a
couple of smashing blows on campbells
face which had sent the smaller man reel-
ing to the floor dazed and bleeding

  of course healey had understood die
circumstances perfectly-had even egged
wheelock on-but that nellie should prefer
the brutal bully who called a man a coward
because he was unable to cope with a fellow
twice his size hurt campbells pride more
than he cared to think his mind was full
of bitterness against the two men and the
 feet  vs  feet 	

girl-against the fate that seemed relent-
lessly bent on grinding him down into the
gutter and starvation

  in his search for work there was how-
ever one last resort at the head of a spur
track branching off from the main line stood
the factory of mallon brothers company
manufacturers of boxes it was just possi-
ble that he could secure a job there it was
not his intention to remain in the neighbor-
hood longer than was necessary but before
he could leave it was essential that he save
enough money to pay his railroad fare

  a shrill whistle sounded behind him and
he jumped from the ties to the other side of
the deep gully bordering the track to wait
until the train should have passed it
proved to be a long freight bound for
mallons with jim wheelock in the engine-
cab as the locomotive puffed laboriously
up the grade past the young man the big
engineer leaned from the window and spy-
ing the waiting figure burst into a jeering
laugh

  having the time of yer life aint yer 
he remarked ironically going far

  blind rage seethed up in campbells
heart he shook his fist after the vanishing
locomotive as he yelled

  ill have the time of my life with you
ill get you yet do you hear ill get you
yet

  another burst of laughter floated back
from the engine now almost hidden by the
thick trees that lined the track a cloud of
black smoke slowly ascending the mountain
spur at the top of which the factory stood
showed campbell the position of the freight

  he decided that it would be worse than
useless to apply at the factory for work un-
til wheelock had made his return trip the
big engineer would only hold him up to
ridicule and spoil whatever chances he
might have the one thing to do was to
seek out some convenient spot near enough
to the track to see the passing of the train
and await the return of the freight be-
sides it was some time after midday and
he felt hungry and tired

  his eye pained him a good deal and his
body was bruised and sore as a result of the
unequal encounter of the night before he
started slowly along the track keeping a
lookout for a likely place to sit down the
trees grew thickly along the embankment
and in some places the low bushes and run-
ning vines were so thick that he had to tear
a way through them

  there were no houses within a mile or
two and the homes of the factory employ-
ees were for the most part on the other side
of the mountain

  reaching the spur track he observed a
large flat rock half hidden from where he
stood and wholly concealed from the view
of any one passing on a train a short dis-
tance up the incline it would make an ex-
cellent resting-place and he decided to
utilize it

  the gully was wide but shallow at this
point a little farther on and it disap-
peared altogether gaging the width of the
gully with his eye campbell made a spring
for the other side as his feet struck a
stone moved under him-turned-rolled

  he made a frantic clutch for the over-
hanging bushes but they slipped from his
grasp and he fell to the bottom of the em-
bankment one leg doubled cruelly under
him he heard a sharp snap and a sicken-
ing pain shot through his right knee his
head struck a sharp stone and lie knew no
more

  when his senses returned the october sun
was sinking in a blaze of autumn glory in
the cloud-flecked west for a moment or
two he lay still trying to remember where
he was and how he had come there then
a twinge of pain in his leg brought realiza-
tion of his plight

  he tried to move and fell back gasping
in agony great beads of perspiration
broke out on his brow from the position
in which he lay there was no doubt of the
truth-his right leg was broken below the
knee

  a sudden movement a few yards below
him caught his ear he opened his lips to
cry for help but with an uncontrollable im-
pulse closed them again without uttering a
sound

    there  said a low husky voice which
he perceived came from the tracks of the
main line a short distance away  when
no  conies along here i guess therell be
doings 

   shes due in half an hour came the
reply in a guarded tone passes at 
wed better mosey along and come back la-
ter ive got the spikes all right and
theres no trace of anything out of the way
no onell notice but it wont do for us to
be seen hanging around here if any one
should happen to pass the track-walkers
just gone i seen him just before we come
up come along


the railroad mans magazine

  the voices ceased and campbell could
hear their owners moving off through the
woods with a thrill of horror he realized
that they had removed the spikes holding
the rails to the ties-that tbey meant to
wreck no  the east-bound flier due as
they supposed in half an hour since the
track-walker had passed there was little
fear of detection

  that the scoundrels were unaware of the
change of schedule of no  which would
bring her along an hour later than their
calculations mattered little there were no
other trains due in either direction and no
one passed that way save an occasional
tramp nothing could save the flier if she
struck the frightful trap they had set for her

  campbell shuddered must he lie there
powerless and helpless unable to prevent
the disaster shouting would avail him
nothing the factory was too far away for
any one to be attracted by his cries and
it would serve only to bring down upon him
the vengeance of the two wreckers who had
just gone and who would await the con-
summation of their plans at no great dis-
tance

  no if anything were to be done he must
make his way up nearer the factory until he
could make some one of the men hear him
could he do it already the torture of his
broken limb and wounded head was becom-
ing almost unbearable

  he waited a moment then took a long
breath turned over and began to work him-
self along toward the track dragging his
injured leg after him

  the pain made him sick and dizzy but
after what seemed hours of unremitting
effort he had spanned the few feet that lay
between him and the rails at the top of the
wide shallow gully

  resting a moment on the narrow space
beside the ties he gritted his teeth and
dragged himself doggedly on a violent
nausea seized him his brain whirled the
trees beside the track swayed in a mad un-
canny dance foot by foot he won his tor-
tured way upward

  there was a strange singing in his ears
lights flashed before his dimming eyes
for an eternity he dragged himself on in
exquisite agony then he sank beside the
track the western glorv had faded twi-
light was descending over the woods oh
just to be able to rest-to rest-

  suddenly a whistle shrilled the sound
penetrated his dazed senses he raised his

head the freight was coming down the
spur

  campbell knew what it meant the
freight not the flier would strike the track
where the spikes had been removed it
would spread the rails and hurl itself into
the ditch

  and wheelock-wheelock his enemy-
would go down with his engine down to
death and destruction

  campbell laughed aloud in savage joy
wheelock the man who had called him
a quitter-who had said he had a yellow
streak and struck him down he would
die-die beneath tons of twisted steel-
crushed-mangled-

  but nellie the thought of the girl
stilled the delirious laughter on campbells
lips nellie loved wheelock whatever he
might be or might do she had promised
to marry him

  what would she say to the man who had
let him go to his death-who had gloried in
the suffering it had been in his power to
avert the young man shivered

  no wheelock mustnt die he must save
wheelock for nellie she loved him-she
wanted him she didnt want a poor devil
of an oiler who couldnt hurt a man twice
his size well it didnt matter nothing
mattered much except that he wanted to
rest perhaps he had better rest a little and
then go on his head drooped

  above him the whistle screamed again
the freight was coming he must hurry
feverishly he began to crawl upward his
hands were torn and bleeding from the grav-
el and stones jagged splinters gashed his
palms as he pulled himself along by the
edges of the ties but he felt nothing knew
nothing but that he must stop the freight
before she reached the main track

  the black bulk of the locomotive swept
into view around the curve ahead running
slowly but already beginning to gather
speed campbell propped himself on his
hands and raised a feeble shout there was
no sign from the oncoming monster an-
other cry broke from his lips through a
haze he could see a head poked through the
cab-window

  stop stop danger he cried with
all his strength waving his handkerchief
over his head

  the whistle sounded but the engine did
not slacken its pace

  horror seized upon the man by the track
wheelock could not stop he must believe
 feet  vs  feet 



that this was an attempt on campbells part
to  get him as he had promised he would
not stop

  nothing could stop him now he would
go on to his death and nellie- if
wheelock should die-

  dully campbell wondered if the engineer
would stop for him dead since he would not
for him living

  with a last despairing effort he raised his
bruised and battered body half upright

  main track - spikes out-wreckers
danger  he shrieked then he flung him-
self across the rails directly in the path of
the oncoming train

  he heard a wild scream of the whistle a
grinding of brake-shoes-caught a glimpse
of a great dark mass sweeping down upon
him-and then a bottomless black abyss

  when he opened his eyes again there were
roses above him-red roses on a white back-
ground he put out one groping hand
something felt soft beneath it where was
he he let his gaze wander about him as
his brain slowly shook off the mists of un-
consciousness

  he was lying in a small white bed in a
long low room sunlight streamed in the
windows a smell of iodoform permeated
the air and beside the bed stood a table
holding numerous bottles and small glasses

  at the window her back turned toward
him stood a slender white-gowned figure
he made an inarticulate murmur the fig-
ure turned and came quickly to his side

  nellie he whispered incredulously

   hush you mustnt talk 

  the soft voice seemed to him the epitome
of all music

   where-how- somehow his tongue
halted curiously

   you are not to talk the doctor said
so the girl took one of the emaciated
hands that lay on the white counterpane and
stroked it gently

   how long have i been here  

  nearly two weeks but you are better
now you must be quiet

   i remember now he was silent a mo-
ment living over that terrible time the
door opened and a grave-faced man entered
campbell glanced toward him with a faint
smile

   she wont let me talk he complained
 cant i there are so many things i want
to ask about

  the doctor bent over feeling the pa-
tients pulse with a practised touch

    miss healey will tell you what you want
to know but you must be quiet and not talk
to her lie said he nodded to the girl and
left the room

   wheelock   campbell murmured as
nellie turned to him again

   safe the men were captured

    and the flier-was any one hurt  

  no one-but you the girls eyes
filled with sudden tears

    dont cry nellie campbell begged her
feebly  dont im all right dont cry
please i know youre sorry

   sorry sorry  sobbed the girl  oh
if you had been killed i-i-

  would you have cared if i had dear
cared he questioned anxiously

  she nodded unable to speak

   but my dear im down and out i
havent a penny im hurt-ive lost my
job i have nothing to offer you im a
failure-just a failure nellie

    but it isnt true-none of its true the
superintendent was on that freight jack he
had been up to see mr mallon and was
coming down in the caboose he saw what
you did and he says when you are well
enough you are to have your old place in
the office with more money your salary
began the day you stopped the freight jim
said-he said you were a hero jack

  campbell heaved a deep sigh of thanks-
giving presently he said

   the city will be awfully lonely nellie
without you

  the girls head drooped a little and a
soft flush stole up over her cheeks

   you neednt be alone unless-unless you
want to jack she whispered

   but wheelock  he said you-

   it was a lie she interrupted fiercely
 i never cared for him-never said i did
he told me things you had said about me-
told me you were a coward and i-

  you believed him campbells voice
was wistful she nodded again

   but now i know it isnt true you
didnt tack you couldnt 

  nellie nellie-dear 

   hush  she said suddenly remember-
ing the doctors injunction  you are not
to talk you know

  campbell looked up at her a wonderful
light in his sunken eyes

  nellie he whispered his voice was
so low that she bent over him to hear he
put up one arm and drew her down until his
lips found hers

special traveling correspondent of the railroad mans magazine

no -in the new southwest

garcia the intrepid-game lillian mcknight-sara rooke a real heroine-
what one nite opr saw-some ghosts that
meant business

j senor it was the most big large
sacrifice of a mans self for the
most big large purpose ah but
that senor jesus garcia was the
one locomozie aingineer with
the one most big large heart
and when he save the whole town
from the destroy by fire he make the name
as the savior of the town si senor the
name of garcia live forever as the most
great hero among all these hoinbres and
senoritas of the railroads in the mexico

  thus my old friend florentino romero
the veteran and scholarly telegraph operator
for the mexican central railroad began
his story while we st in the office el tele-
grafo in the railroad station at juarez mex-
ico on the rio grande opposite el paso
texas	-

   the senor garcia florentino con-
tinued he was the best aingineer on the
narrow-gage railroad that tuii from the pi-
lares mine to the city of nacozari this
nacozari have the seventy thousand person
and is most close by the rio grande and
only one leetle way from that city of doug-
las in the arizona

  that day garcia run his iren de cargo
freight-train into nacozari and up to the
smelter of the americanos in the meedle of
the town

   he stop bv the warehouse right be-
hind his aingine he have the two cars of the
dynamite and behind the dynamite he

have many flat open cars of the straw for
the burro-bed

   garcia he get off his engine to smoke
the cigarito just then he see his brake-
man light a cigarito also  and one moment
two moment later garcia see die spark from
the brakemans cigarito fly over the straw in
the flat open car and garcia he speak in
inglis the crv

   fire 

   garcia he then run to that straw on fire
and he begin beat out that fire with his
hands and his feet also he call upon his
brakeman to give the assistance but the fire
spread most quick all garcia can do is
bleester the hand and foot while the flames
grow into most big large fire which soon
reach those two cars of the dynamite and
set them on blaze

   by these time most three hundred of
the miners the smelter men and the ameri-
canos gather by the fire to fight it and the
senoritas stand by to do the watch

   but preetty soon garcia speak inglis
and shout

     run i have the two cars of the dyna-
mite the explode will keel mucha many
run senores and senoritas run queek 
by these moment one thousand two
thousand citizens have come to these place
w hen they see the two cars dynamite all
on the fire and hear garcia speak inglis
with the most grand excite in his voice they
run avvav most fast

ten thousand miles by rail



    all except the one senorita who is mu dm
bonita and who cry out in the grand dis-
tress to garcia

  come jesus mio thou shalt come
with us in order that thou shalt live

   madre de dios garcia gather that
senorita in his arms and keess her on the
one cheek and then on the other cheek and
say  adios senorita 

    then he leap into that aingine and push
away the machinery that starts that aingine
and so alone on his train he take it away
toward the country that is open and on the
desert

    what you think garcia think when he
pull that train on fire with the two cars of
dynamite out of the nacozari ah he was
the one brave man garcia he think the
whole town get the grand destroy unless he
pull that dynamite into the country that is
the desert

    garcia run that train on fire out from
nacozari and come to the section-house
where ees thirteen hombres of the section

    and then there comes one big explode
that dig the hole into the
earth the thirty feet deep

    the roar of the ex-
plode shake the city of
nacozari like the dog
shake the rat and the
locomotive and the cars
of that train of garcia fly
most everywhere through
the state of sonora so
that no one can find any
two parts of that train of
garcia in any one place

    and that section-house
on the place of the ex-
plode  it is not to be seen
at all after the big ex-
plode and the thirteen
hombres of the mexico
that were in that house
become all dead

    one leetle nntchacho
the twelve year in age-
son of the americano

senor chisholm who is
the conduct of the train
of garcia-that muchacho
was doing the play at two
hundred feet from the sec-
tion-house when one rail-
road - tie flying the three
hundred feet hit the boy
and kill him

  and so senor that is all except that
the bonita senorita that gave the entreat to
garcia to run away with her in order to
live-that senorita she polish her eyes with
the tears for the one year the two years
after that explode

   the town was save and garcia was the
savior and so i have come to the finish
scrior

   but what became of garcia the heroic
engineer i asked

   ah senor there was no funeral for
him because there was no body of garcia
to lie in the service they could not put
him down in the sand of the desert to bury
never senor did they find one most little
small piece of that body of garcia we
must entertain senor the suppose that
garcia was killed

 he girl who was game

  there was revelry by night in roswell
new mexico for the reason that the parents
of one of lillian mcknights pupils were

all except the

one senorita who
    is mucha
    bonita


the railroad mans magazine

giving a dance in honor of the engagement
of the fair lillian to frank miller a loco-
motive fireman

  lillian was the youngest and most popu-
lar school-teacher that roswell had ever
known and frank was the handsomest and
best-dressed fireman on the santa fe system
in new mexico

  when they walked down the street to-
gether people turned and took a second look
at them-just because they were good to
look at

  that night as frank waltzed with lil-
lian his engineer ben zieger informed all
the young folks at the party that frank was
a beau brummel and a don juan and then
declared that frank should have been a
dancing-master instead of a shoveler of coal
for a railroad

  before the revelry ceased that night
frank took lillian aside and said to her
lets surprise em lillian lets cut
the engagement short lets marry on the
qt to-morrow night ive about a hun-
dred and thirty dollars saved up and i
allow thats enough for a start at house-
keeping

   lets replied lillian laconically but
with a world of meaning in her eyes

  all right said frank ill get in
from my run to-morrow night around six
oclock you meet me at eight-over at
judge walters meantime keep the blinds
drawn on that pretty mouth of yours

  the next evening just as lillian was
about to slip out of the house to meet frank
at the judges office her father came in
saying

   bad news lillian frank was hurt
to-day-over at south springs station
the poor boy cried lillian taking
off her  wedding  hat  where is he
now  

    in the hospital here

  the poor boy  repeated lillian again
putting on her  bridal  hat with its  bri-
dal  veil ill go to him at once how
did he get hurt 

   fell between the engine and his train
   badly hurt father

   go see for yourself my daughter
meantime over at the station engineer
zieger franks cab comrade made this
remark to the railroad men who had gath-
ered to hear the story of the accident

   i reckon that the school-teacher will
never again be seen dancing with frank
miller boys too bad aint it 

    shell never again be seen walking with
him neither observed one of franks fel-
low firemen

   fact is said a third railroader i
reckon lillian mcknight wont front up
alongside of frank miller to get unionized
in marriage nohow nor never

  maybe youre right and maybe you
aint-about the unionizing spoke up en-
gineer zieger with some heat  frank will
be out of the hospital in less n seven weeks
-and i allow that the school-teacher is
some of a game girl and no piker

  nearly eight weeks later frank miller
was discharged from the hospital attend-
ants helped him into a buggy that stood
waiting at the gate frank took the reins
and with a thank you boys giddap
drove away

  five minutes afterward a buggy pulled
up in front of the domicil of a certain wool-
grower and sheep-herder of roswell in
the vehicle sat frank miller he was whis-
tling a merry tune a man appeared on the
front porch

    good evening mr mcknight said the
man in the buggy  is lillian there  ask
her to come out please

   lillian flew out to the buggy

  are you game asked frank

   bet answered the school-teacher but
her expressive eyes threw frank a look no
less eager than on the night of the dance

    then get in said frank

    ill get my hat she answered

  no come along without a hat in-
sisted frank

  lillian stepped into the buggy frank
again cried giddap and they drove
away

   half an hour later the strangest wedding
ceremony ever witnessed in roswell took
place in front of the house of judge welter
a buggy stood by the curb and in it sat
frank miller and lillian mcknight by
the side of the buggy stood judge welter
reading the marriage-service round about
stood a crowd of uninvited guests listening
first to the judges questions and then to the
responses of the two in the buggy

    amen  finally said the judge

  giddap said frank miller-and he
drove away with mrs frank miller sitting
by his side

  a buggy rolled into the grounds of a
pretty little cottage on the edge of the town
and stopped at the front porch a mexican
servant came out wheeling an invalid-chair
ten thousand miles by rail



he and die bride helped the groom out of
the buggy and into the chair

   the groom was then wheeled into the
house and the electric lights in the cosily
furnished living-room revealed this inter-
esting spectacle

   the grooms legs ended at the knees

   but the grooms eyes were
no less bright than they were
at the dance on the night

the disaster at folsom

   at  one night a colorado and
southern train an hour late rushed past the

    	r r

 station at grande new mexico and con-
 tinued northward toward folsom on the
 colorado-new mexico line

   folsom was eighteen miles away en-
 gineer walter druid had a clear track and
 a fairly easy grade as grades go in that
 mountainous region and he allowed his

    about a mile north of grande station
 however druids fireman suddenly shouted
  shut her off stop her 

  druids hands worked at air and throttle
 as he said quite calmly

  what do you see 

   a man waving a red lantern answered
 the fireman

  the train squeaking and grinding came
 to a stop the man with the red lantern-
 it was an ordinary farm lantern with a red
 bandanna tied around it-came to the side
 of the cab and said

   my names cook im a farmer my
 land is down here in the valley but im
 a son of a sea-cook if i know whether or not
 ill own any tiling you can call a farm at
 sun-up to-morrow

   conductor nichols in charge of the train
 came running up asking breathlessly
 whats all this fuss about

  let me introduce mr cook replied
 the engineer


the railroad mans magazine

  whats the matter asked conductor
nichols turning to the man with the ban-
danna-covered lantern

  youre to go no farther toward fol-
som answered the farmer youre to
stand still

  well well

  the night telephone operator at fol-
som the farmer said called me up bout
half hour ago and told me to get quick upon
high ground shes all right that gal is
i just naturally admire her spunk

  you mean sara rooke asked-con-
ductor nichols why all we boys know
her well but how did vou come to stop
us

   she said i was to warn any up train
the farmer replied  said i was to warn
you that all the bridges between here and
folsom are probably down and for you to
take no chances

  but whats the matter great scott
man why should the bridges be down
and why should you go to high ground in
the middle of the night

coming down the canon

  flood answered the farmer helping
himself to a chew

  why didnt you say so in the first
place expostulated the impatient con-
ductor big flood

   reckon  that telephone-gal said that
a wall of water thirteen feet high and a
mile wide was sweeping down cimarron
canon and was wiping folsom out of ex-
istence

   but-hang it man exclaimed the con-
ductor excitedly  if that was the case then
-great qesar what about that telephone
operator herself how did she happen to
be still at the switch havent you done
anything to save her life 

  dont frenzy up like that said farmer
cook youvegot all night to wait here
whats the hurry well that telephone-
girl says to me

    mr cook she says  youre probably
the last subscriber i shall be able to warm
ive already warned over forty of our sub-
scribers to get to high ground i hear the
water coming near they told me an hour
ago to leave this building-but im taking
a chance in order to give notice to the folks
in the valley

    well is that all   asked the conductor
    yep except im thinkin

  thinking of what

  well that gal didnt say good-by
she said  farewell  and im just won-
derin thats all

   druid said conductor nichols speak-
ing to the engineer guess we better back
down to grande station

   all the rest of that night and the follow-
ing day and half the next night that colo-
rado and southern train with its hun-
dred and more passengers stood at grande
station almost hourly came more and
more harrowing news of the disaster at
folsom

  nearly all the buildings in the town had
been carried away many lives had been
lost hundreds of head of cattle had been-
swept away crops in the valley had been
cleared from the fields as closely as if
burned off the rails of the colorado and
southern had been twisted like wire the
depot at folsom had collapsed like paste-
board section foreman guerin and his
seventeen-year-old daughter had been swept
away with their house while spectators on
the high ground listened to their agonized
cries

   and what about that plucky telephone
operator at folsom who called up so many
folks and warned them to get out of the
way asked conductor nichols of the
telegraph operator at grande doe the
wire say anything of her  

  you mean sara rooke sure thing
hers was the most heroic stunt ever per-
formed by i a woman in the whole west
country

   a little before eleven oclock last night
she was warned that the wall of water com-
ing down cimarron canon would reach her
building in less than an hour

  did she fly no she utilized that
hour in calling up telephone subscribers in
the valley and warning them forty per-
sons have already publicly proclaimed that
they owe their lives to her farmer cook
was the last man she called up just before
the water struck her building

  shes dead asked conductor nichols
in an awed voice

  no one knows she hasnt been seen
nor heard of

  at midnight on the second night how-
ever news came from division superin-
tendent shack saying that the last bridge
had been repaired and that the train could
proceed with extreme caution

  about four in the morning that train
ten thousand miles by rail



pulled into stricken folsom one of the	his bones froze stiff his hair stood on end

first sights that met the eyes of crew and	and he thought that lie was looking upon

passengers was two-men carrying an im-	the ghost of darwins missing link
provised stretcher on which lay a body cov- at four oclock in the morning the flier

youve got all night to wait here whats the hurry

ered with a horse-blanket behind them
came a long file of silent marchers walking
two by two with bowed heads

  one stepped aside and came close to the
train-crew and whispered

  its the body of sara rooke the tele-
phone operator

  where are they taking her asked
conductor nichols in a low tone

  to the town hall theyre using it
for a morgue

  whered they find her asked en-
gineer druid

  twelve miles down the canon-with her
headpiece still gripped to her ears

seen by the nite opr

  job morrow night operator of the rock
island station at tulsa oklahoma had an
experience on an arctic night in february
when for a moment or two the marrow in

from st louis bound for oklahoma city
pulled into the station job went out into
weather many degrees below zero said
 howdy  to the conductor then retreated
to the warmth of his office

  after the train had crawled away leaving
tulsa once more in its usual condition of
vast peace job sat close to the stove and
read

  at four-thirty however he stepped to the
table by the window to get his pipe he
happened to look out of the window

   its  it for its neither man nor wom-
an job thought

  he tried to give vocal expression to the
thought but could not the words con-
gealed in his throat

  standing outside the window with its
chalk-white face pressed close against the
pane stood a white-clad figure its eyes
were fixed on the operator in a vacant stare

  its lower jaw was dropped leaving the


the railroad mans magazine

mouth wide open and giving to the ghastly
face the appearance of boundless stupidity

  job tried to step backward but found
that he had become mummified he couldnt
budge his feet could not lift his hand to
wave the thing away from the window
could not so much as avert his eyes so as
not to see it

  suddenly however the figure turned from
the window and glided down the platform
eastward

  job as suddenly regained power of move-
ment and speech thrusting his head over
the table and close to the window he peered
out hoping to catch a last glimpse of the
retreating thing

   it sure must be a ghost he muttered
 because it moves as noiselessly as a rub-
ber tire

  still peering out with his face close to
the pane job wondered why he hadnt felt
the usual rush of wind and rattling of
chains that he supposed always accompanied
an apparition of the kind

  just then the white horror reappeared
coming westward and again stopped at the
window to stare with hideous eyes at the
night operator

  job threw up his hand protectingly and
side-stepped as if the thing outside were a
highwayman threatening him with a gun

only for a brief moment the figure paused
then it glided down the platform westward

  job wondered what he should do a full
two minutes be waited expecting to see the
thing again return to the window

    its gone he finally said to himself

  he tiptoed to the door opened it cau-
tiously and looked out a rush of icy air
came in he peered eastward and saw the
white figure standing immovable at the end
of the platform seemingly engaged in pro-
found contemplation of a very crooked tree
opposite the station that was outlined by
the starlight

  job put on his overcoat seized a lighted
lantern stepped out and stole down the
platform toward the thing in white

  the thing now moved sideways like a
crab it faced the approaching operator
however who now by the light of the lan-
tern perceived that it wore very thin white
pajamas and was in its bare feet

   the thing staring at the crooked tree its
mouth still wide open moved its lower jaw
out of its throat cam the words

   tree straighten thyself

  it extended its arm skyward as if thus

further to command the crooked tree to
shoot up straight

  the voice ounded muffled the words
were articulated rather than spoken job
said to himself

   it cant be a ghost after all its too-
too solid for a spook it looks like a man
maybe its a drunk

  the figure turned and looked down at a
tiny irrigation ditch that flowed past the
platform

   stream muttered the thing  reverse
thy current

  it waved its arm up-hill to indicate the
direction in which it wished the water to
run

  seeming bored however by the perversity
of the stream in continuing to flow down-
hill instead of up as commanded the figure
now started up the platform toward job
j-no murmured the operator as the
thing glided along  its not a drunk it
walks too straight for that

  as the figure passed him job had the
thought that perhaps it was a dope fiend

   and yet no he murmured contra-
dicting himself  were he drugged he
would be lying down dead to the world

  as the figure continued on down the plat-
form job further soliloquized

   hes in a hypnotic trance some hyp-
notist maybe a thousand miles away is
directing this mans movements

  the thing had come to a standstill with
one foot planted forward of the other as if
a marching soldier had suddenly become a
statue

  job hastened forward to take a closer
look and reached the things side just in
time to see its lower jaw wagging again
it said

   this train is running too fast i cant
sleep porter open the window at my feet
and throw me out onto a quiet strawberry

bed

   rarebit fiend job sofdy assured him-
self  hes riding a nightmare

  the figure now suddenly deigned to no-
tice job staring at the operator vacantly
as when it had peered through the window
it wagged its lower jaw to say

   porter dieres a mule walking around
in my berth take him into the day-coach
where he belongs

   crazy man thought job hes mad
hes an escaped lunatic

  the figure now leaned against the wall
of the station and threw back its head the
ten thousand miles by rail



mouth opened still wider the eyes stared
more vacantly than ever and then - the
yawning chasm in its face gave forth a
sound like the tearing of a sheet then a
sound like the sawing of a plank then a
sound like the swan-song of a burro

   ive got it murmured job excitedly
 hes a sleep-walker hes a perambula-
ting somnambulist

  the operator held the lantern close to the
mans face and said in his natural voice

   arent you awful cold old
sport in that suit of gauze

  but the figure in white
snored on lustily

  job holding the lantern
still closer to the figure no-
ticed that it wpre no less than
three diamond rings job be-
gan singing rings on her
fingers bells on her toes

  all of a sudden the figure
stopped snoring and ejected
from his open mouth  i won-
der whos kissing her now 

  the mule shouted job
morrow

  the figure closed its mouth
with a snap it made a shud-
dering movement it seemed
to feel the thrill of cold air
down its spine it shivered

its teeth began chattering

the light of human intelligence came into
its eyes and it spoke saying

  why are you poking that lantern into
my face

   search me answered job  what you
doing here  

   search me replied the man  gee
but im cold howd i get here what
am i doing here  

   come inside said job morrow

  ten minutes later the erstwhile ghost
was hugging the stove in the tulsa station
now dressed in overalls an ancient jumper
and a pair of shoes that job had cast off
he and the operator were laughing like
boys

   tom janson said the night operator
to the thing you may be a salesman trav-
eling out of new york city as you say
and you may be holding down a good job
as you tell me you are but all the same
its not safe for you to be traveling alone in
oklahoma know what you need you
need a keeper and a trained nurse and a
night watchman

   the last thing i remember said the
overalled mr janson of new york  was
undressing in my berth in the pullman of
the flier i was bound for oklahoma city
but when the train stopped here i must
have arose and sleep-walked out of the
pullman and let the train go on leaving
me- slumbering upright on your platform
the phenomenon is that while asleep i
didnt feel a bit cold-though attired only
in a suit of madras

its it for
man nor

  when the gray dawn began breaking
through the window of tulsa station a loco-
motive whistle was heard and job jumped
up saying

  here comes your train tom janson
i wired ahead ordering your clothes put
off the flier at oklahoma city youll find
your raiment there in the railroad station
dont fall asleep  the way over

what the southern men saw

  it was a starless pitch-black night in
august the night following that on which
the worst cyclone that ever swept through
the middle west struck the yards of the
southern railway at east st louis


the railroad mans magazine

	a

   iii the switchmans shanty in those yards
at the hour of twelve there were gathered a
number of the southerns engineers fire-
men helpers and switchmen including en-
gineer iowell a man who knew no fear
except in the presence of a  ghost

  present also was harry rigsby now
employed by the missouri

kansas and texas railway
at st joseph missouri
but at that time acting as
a switchman for the south-

the door and soft-footed into the darkness
of what was then perhaps the darkest rail-
road yard around st louis at that time
there were no electric lights in the yard nor
even switch-stand lights as powell crossed
the tracks nothing broke the gloom save the
headlight of his own engine on track 

            moreover the yard was
strewn with the wreckage of
cars locomotives and build-
ings representing the devasta-
tion wrought by the cyclone

the space in which we had to turn was so narrow that we all went down-

ern in the east st louis yard it was
harry rigsby who saw powells ghost with
his own eyes and lived to tell me the tale

  in the switchmans shanty engineer pow-
ell after listening with wide-open mouth
and bulging eyes to a ghost story that harry
rigsby related tiptoed to the door opened
it a crack peered out then closed it softly
with a shudder

   gee  he exclaimed  its spooky out
there

   its time to bring out your engine aint
it asked one of his fellow engineers

   yes replied powell  but-say there
are a lot of dead men out there in the wreck-
age left by the cvclone aint there

  well

  well i just cant-say jim here
he turned to his helper  you go bring
out my engine to track  will you

  the helper went away to return ten min-
utes later saying

  shes ready for you oil track 
powell

  powell nervously and reluctantly opened

cars were piled one upon tlieotlier and in
them as powell knew lav the bodies of sev-
eral men who had been killed

  meantime the railroaders in the switch
shanty were talking about powell and his
fear of ghosts one engineman said

   those corpses out there are sure on
powells nerves

   yes assented switchman harry rigs-
by if he sees anything queer out in the
yard to-night hell sure think its a ghost
just then something happened that made
rigsbys words seem prophetic the door
was almost knocked off its hinges by powell
falling against it trying to get inside he
reeled into the shanty and fell on the floor
in a dead faint

  his clothes were torn in several places
his lantern-globe was broken and he had a
scalp wound from which the blood was run-
ning down his chalk-white face

  they poured water on his head till he
revived

  boys he cried in awed tones ive
seen a ghost for sure
ten thousand miles by rail



   nonsense  answered rigsby  youre
just nervous thats all

  nerves nothin i know a ghost when
i see one at first i heard funny noises
i listened and heard the rattling of chains-
just the kind of a noise that always goes
with a ghost then i heard the tread of
footsteps-very soft footsteps

   i looked-and boys he continued  i
tell you i saw a thing with bright eyes-
and the thing itself was as big as a cow it
had a white face and it said something to

-in a bunch like a footeall team

me in a shaky shivery voice and in a lan-
guage i didnt understand i tell you it
was the ghastliest thing i ever want to see
it was a ghost if you think im talking
through the armholes of my vest come out
and see the thing for yourselves

  we decided to investigate armed with
clubs pokers and rocks we permitted pow-
ell to lead the way toward his ghost

  suddenly as they reached the spot where
the wreckage was piled highest and under
which five men were known to be lying
dead the crowd of ghost-chsers heard fun-
ny sounds they listened and-yes they
distinctly heard the rattling of chains

there whispered powell with chat-
tering teeth  didnt i tell yop listen
all hands stood stock-still with cocked
ears all plainly heard a voice-a hideous

cracked voice speaking a strange language
it sounded like the gibber of a female luna-
tic the gibbering continued too till all of
a sudden-they saw the ghost

  yes out from the wreckage forming the
temporary sarcophagus of five railroad men
stepped the thing

  rigsby said his heart seemed to stop
beating

  toward the men who stood rooted in
their tracks and all aghast glided the ghost
dragging chains that clinked and clanked
over rail and ties with frightful distinctness
it gibbered persistently and it beckoned to
the men throwing out long lean lanky
arms

   yes rigsby told me afterward  it
was as big as a cow as powell had said and
its eyes were as large as aish-pans there
were eight of us in that bunch-eight brave
men ambushed by that ghost between two
piles of wrecked cars the eight of us
as if actuated by a single thought turned to
fly from the awful apparition

    the space in which we had to turn how-
ever was so narrow that we all went down
in a bunch like a football team while
each man tried to extricate himself from
those on top of him up came the ghost and
walked round and round us talking its gib-
berish and laughing in cracked tones-a
cackle that was simply appalling

    the first man to extricate himself from
the football pile was engineer frank wil-
son he sat on the ground and suddenly he
exclaimed

     well ill be hanged if it aint a hand-
organ monk dragging its chain

   just then too into view came the ital-
ian who owned the monkey

  the meeting of that italian and his
monk was like that of a mother who has
found her long lost child it was only the
pathos of it that restrained powell from
thumping that italian good and plenty

   say added rigsby  if ever you hap-
pen to meet engineer powell in the east st
louis yards dont breathe a word to him
about monkeys on his scalp to this day
he carries a scar from the wound incurred
when he butted a coal-car off the track while
beating it away from that ghost

if youc wheels are slipping its time to be using your sand grit is the
      secret of grip-diary of an old engineer
the man who listened

by benjamin rush thornbury

         the portly gentlemans sequel was a tale
         that not even the superintendent ever heard

ijgwpn the smoking-compartment of a
bii pullman on the west-bound train
were three men two of them
 i one the superintendent of the
road and the other an ex-rail-
road man were engaged in con-
versation on the merits of railroaders in
general and concerning those who main-
tained their positions through official rela-
tionships in particular the third a well-
groomed portly gentleman sat quietly in
the corner puffed a cigar and listened

  railroading isnt a profession its a
science the ex-railroad man was protest-
ing  ive always maintained that these
relationship jobs are a detriment to the
service and its been my observation that as
a rule the incumbents never make good
ive known some exceptions to that
rule in fact i have one in mind now

  ill admit that it sometimes mixes up
the service as it did in tom goodells case
but as i say he was an exception to the
rule

  he squinted reminiscently the ex-
railroad man crossed his legs and settled
back in his seat the portly gentleman in
the corner regarded the face of the speaker
intently for a moment then calmly resumed
his smoking

   it was in the old days on the m i and
n continued the superintendent before
it came to be the fashion for general man-
agers to have anterooms to their offices with
brass-buttoned boys to bring in calling-cards
on a silver dish

   old man goodell had come down tj
kensington from the soo io take over the
management of thetoad and while he didnt
have n rear deal of style he more than made
up for it in a system of his own that result-

ed in making the two streaks of rust and a
right-of-way one of the best paying little
roads in the country

  he left the road when the transcon-
tinental took it up and went into business
for himself i was a general utility clerk
in his office at that time my duties ranging
from running down claims for dead stock
to sorting the old mans mail

    it was in the latter capacity that i came
across a letter one morning from tom
goodell tom was a brother of the old
man who had been in the lumber business
up north but who had taken a sudden no-
tion that he wanted to be a railroad man
the letter was a request for a job

  joe kelsoe was trainmaster up at cen-
terpoint at the time and having come up
the ladder from a cub operator naturally
had some set notions likeyourself about
toms kind and wasnt at all backward
about expressing them the boys said he
cussed a blue streak when he got the old
mans letter ordering him to send tom out
braking on the local to learn the road

   well everybody knew at once what that
meant and there was a general howl all
along the line among the trainmen not offi-
cial of course but a lot of talk and as
usual thats about where it ended

   about three months after that ed bur-
ton a freight conductor with a through run
came within an ace of getting into a smash-
up with an east-bound passenger on an or-
der he misconstrued and of course went on
the carpet the old man was always mighty
square with the boys when they got into
trouble and was disposed to be lenient with
ed though he had known for some time
that ed wasnt a man to be running a train

  he was oversensitive on the subject as


the man who listened



that kind usually are so when the old man
offered to compromise by giving him thirty
days and a gravel train when he got back
ed flared up and quit taking a pass back to
arlington where he lived

   that was the only time i ever saw ed
to know him and when he came through
the office looking as black as a thunder-
cloud i surmised he had been having his
troubles in the old mans little sanctum

  well as everybody expected two days
later tom goodell got his train

   i had been out on the road looking up
a claim on some stock that had been killed
and after a muddy ten-mile ride across
country north of seymour i got back to the
station too late for no  which was the last
passenger-train east and there being no ho-
tel in the place i wired kelsoe to stop the
night freight for me

  thats how i happened to be in tom
goodells caboose on his first run out i
altered my opinion of tom that night and
havent changed it since for he proved to
be one of the exceptions i spoke about

   he said he realized just how the boys
felt and hated to see them down on him
simply because he happened to be a relative
of the old man he wanted to be square
with them and was trying not to step on
anybodys toes he wanted to learn the
business and travel on his own merits

  well after we had talked a while he
saiclhe guessed i was tired and wanted to
get some sleep he piled a lot of cushions
on one of the seats and gave me his over-
coat remarking that i might catch cold

    i found out afterward that the particu-
lar seat i occupied was the conductors own
bunking-place and that tom sat in the
cupola all the way into kensington

   what occurred after that i did not
learn until we reached the end of the di-
vision for i did not awaken until we pulled
into the yard and then tom only gave me
the story in a general way

   the night operator at menden had
given him orders to pick up some empty
stock-cars at arlington and i guess thats
all that saved us from about the worst wreck
the road ever had for we would have gone
into that open switch at a forty-five-mile
clip

  they usually went through from men-
den witiiout stopping that being a part of
the run where they made up time as it
was they had slowed down for the stop
and when they unexpectedly shot in on the

siding from the upper end the engineer had
his train pretty well under control so the
little bump they gave that string of empties
did no damage the switch had been
thrown and the light changed so that it
showed white

  the superintendent paused to relight his
cigar and for a time the only sound was
the rhythmic click of the wheels over the
rail joints the ex-railroad man shifted
his position uneasily the portly gentle-
man got up and went to the water-cooler
then surveyed himself a moment in the long
glass and returned to his seat in the corner

  as a rule went on the superintendent
thoughtfully  trainmen are away above the
average when it comes to points of honor
but there are exceptions to that rule too hu-
man nature being pretty much the same in
every department of life and sometimes
when a man gets a deal that isnt conducive
to brotherly love he loses his senses

   anyway when they found out about the
changed switch-light the crew laid it to
every cause but the right one as tom
jumped down from the caboose steps how-
ever his quick eye had caught sight of a
man ducking around the end of the station
that looked an awful lot like ed burton

  he said nothing about this when he
came up where the boys were talking but
sided with one of the brakemen who in-
sisted that a tramp had done the work the
next morning however he and the old man
were closeted for the better part of an hour
i could tell by his loud tone that the ole
man was considerably worked up about-
something for he always was a quiet sort
of a man all the while tom was talking
in a low pleading voice and now and then
i could hear ed burtons name

   after a while they came out and the
old man took his pass-book from his desk
and filled out a blank i could see his hand
tremble as he wrote tom took it and
hurried out as i afterward learned to catch
no  he dropped off at arlington on the
opposite side from the station and when he
came back on no  that evening ed bur-
ton was with him

  the superintendent screened his eyes
with his hand and peered through the win-
dow to see the switch-lights of the center-
point-yard twinkling in the darkness

   heres where i get off he said

   i suppose burton was a guest of the
state for a term pursued the ex-railroad
man also rising


the railroad mans magazine

   no lie wasnt denied the superintend-
ent putting on his overcoat  the old man
and tom fixed it up between them to keep
the matter quiet and give burton another
chance

   he wrote to a friend of his somewhere
out west that he wanted ed placed and in a
week or so ed packed up his wife and baby
and followed the letter i never heard of
him after that well good-by im glad to
have met you

    same to you guess ill go to bed re-
turned the ex-railroad man following him
out into the passage

  the superintendent descended to the
platform and walked toward the tall frame
building that housed the division head-
quarters at the foot of the long stair he
halted a moment and looked at the big mo-
gul that was standing on a siding attached
to a long train of all sorts and conditions
that made up no  then turned and
climbed to the office on the second floor

  no  going to get out on time he
asked of the night despatcher who was
bending over the train-sheet at the long
instrument-table

  shes following no  out on time but
i dont know how long shell stay that way
with a green fireman trying to feed that
ten-wheeler kelly says gordons kicking
like a bay steer at the m m for turning
his engine into a family kindergarten and
i dont blame him much for john sharkey
was a good man and had been with gordon
going on three years

    kelly says its open gossip down at the
roundhouse that the old man let sharkey out
just to make a place for his brother

    i cant say as to that officials can be
supremely noncommittal at times  better
give  a slow-up order past camden
theres two cars of dynamite on the siding
there he concluded as he passed into his
office

  no  stopped at camden long enough to
permit the portly gentleman to alight from
the rear pullman and then her red tail-
lights went blinking away like two baleful
eyes in the distance the-jortlv gentleman
looked up at the darkened station down the
siding at the dim outlines of two box cars
then scanned with a quick turn of his head
the few scattered houses that had managed
to get close enough together on the hill be-
hind the station to call themselves a town

  he picked up his grip and started toward
them when he noticed a dark form skulking

in the shadow of the building he was
well able to take care of himself but he was
curious to know what the fellow was up to

  hastily crouching at the end of the high
platform he saw a man steal down to the
track cast a furtive glance about him and
then move cautiously to the switch-stand
where he deliberately smashed the lock with
a coupling-pin

  he had thrown the switch and was turn-
ing the light so that a white gleam flickered
to the rails when the portly gentleman
leaped upon him and pinioned his arms in
a powerful grasp

  the portly gentleman pushed him back-
ward to the edge of the platform where he
lay moaning he sat up presently and
looked at his captor

   i must have been mad to think of such
a thing he said brokenly with a helpless
wave of his hand toward the hill  ive
been slaving five long years to make good
to that little woman up there who believed
in me and then to get shoved out to make
room for the old mans relations-i-it-
oh you cant understand and now-
now i suppose ill have to go over the
road for it

  the strong arm that had held him in its
viselike grip now stole gently across his
shoulders and the voice that spoke was un-
steady with emotion

   oh yes i do my boy i know all
about it and i guess the only road youll
go over will be the transcontinental when
you go back west with me i have some
mines out there and a few miles of railroad
that are all my own i guess we can find
a place for you where you can make good
all right im visiting some friends here
for a few days and we can get together
and talk it over

  the long wailing shriek of a locomotive
was heard far down the track and the
trembling gleam of a headlight transformed
the rails into glistening ribbons of steel

   get down there quick and fix that
switch and then well go and find the little
woman

  my names john sharkey said the
man as they moved slowly toward the hill
may i ask yours

    burton said the other shortly

  they turned and watched the train pull
carefully by the station the light from
the open fire-box fell upon the begrimed
face of a fireman shoveling in some coal

it was on a suburban train theyoung man
in tlie rear car was suddenly addressed by
the woman in the seat behind him

   pardon me sir she said  but would you

a youth from calhoun county illinois
which has nothing but steamboat trans-
portation came over to elsberry missouri the
other day to catch a burlington train to st louis
he had never seen a train and when the hannibal
local came rolling in he stood there gaping
watched it hiss and steam and finally pull out

   i thought you were goin to st louis on

his htad through the window

she had visited the baldwin locomotive works
and later told some of her friends how a
locomotive is made

   you pour she said  a lot of sand into a
lot of boxes and you throw old slove-lids and
tilings into a furnace and then you empty the
molten stream into a hole in the sand and every-
body yells and swears then you pour itout and
let it cool and pound it and then you put it in
a thing that bores holes in it then you screw
it together and paint it and put steam in it and

it goes splendidly and they take it to a drafting-
room and make a blue-print of it but one thing
i forgot-they have to make a boiler one man
gets inside and one gets outside and they pound
frightfully and then they tie it to the other thing

coddling the old girl

by thaddeus s dayton

it is not difficult to understand why an engineer will pet and coddle his
engine and -speak affectionately of it as  she  or the  old girl no
other mechanism of steam and steel has ever been built that shows as
many living breathing human characteristics as a giant locomotive and con-
stant association with one is apt to give rise to the feeling that maybe it has
somewhere within its mighty make-up a will or spirit of its own

    it is only natural that the engineers unconscious recognition of an en-
gines ego or personality should grow into something akin to a feeling of
fondness for a machine that obeys every command or that he should view
with distrust and hate one that is always acting badly

    mr dayton who has gathered the views and experiences of a number
of engineers on this subject has left us to form our own opinions regarding
the odd actions of  old girls it is a subject  which there are many views

strikingly human traits of locomotives frequently cause the wives of
throttle-handlers to become jealous of the place the steel
giantesses hold in their husbands affections

the engine he runs trip after trip-his fa-
vorite-is a great big warm-blooded friend
powerful to the highest degree with intelli-
gence and affection but sometimes whim-
sical obstinate and contrary-as full of
moods as a pretty woman like her human
prototype she can be driven best when
carefully watched over petted and cajoled

  try to force her harshly to do something
and she bucks at once that is why engines
since the days of stephenson have always
been  she  or  her  to the men that run
them another curious thing is that the
better the engineer the more care and af-
fection he lavishes on his engine and she
appreciates it like a true woman

  this may sound a bit incredible to the
casual observer of railroads to him who
rarely sees a locomotive except at the station
where he takes his train and the one where
he leaves it

  his conception of an engine is vaguely
something that puffs acrid smoke makes a


a

          sk one railroad engineer ask
another a third - in fact
question a dozen if you like
-and you will find that
there is hardly among them
one who does not acknowl-
edge that an engine is more human and more
full of the qualities and traits of a living
human being than you ever imagined a mass
of machinery could be

  nobody can tell why this is it is one
of the great unsolvable mysteries of engine-
building and of railroading among the
thousands on thousands of engines in this
country there is not one that does not pos-
sess its own individual characteristics
which are developed to a greater or less
degree just as they are in human beings

  to the engineers who run them each has
its own peculiar personality-something
that distinguishes it from all the rest

  every engineer expresses the idea in dif-
ferent words but the substance is this that


the railroad mans magazine

noise and drags a train across the rails
another thing equally incredible and quite
as worthy of investigation by societies for
psychical research is this

no two engines behave alike

  take ten new engines fresh from the
shops gay with paint and brass and lacquer
and shining steel they are all of exactly
the same pattern cast in the same mold
precisely alike in every particular with
every pin and bolt and screw identical and
yet there is not one engine of the ten that
will run exactly the same as any of the
others

  drive them each a hundred miles with
ten equally competent engineers and you
will find that each has a different indi-
viduality and character one or more will
be rogues-locomotives that the engi-
neers instinct will tell him are foreordained
for some bad end

  others will be sluggish lazy poor steam-
ers voracious in theirappetites for coal
others will be so perfect so amiable so in-
telligent in every way that the fortunate
engineer to whom such an engine is assigned
will lavish upon her untiring affectionate
care and will even spend hours away from
his family watching over her if she comes
into the roundhouse the least bit out of per-
fect mechanical health

  when she is happy said the driver of
one of the engines that hauls a mile-a-min-
ute train  my  old gal  is the sweetest
thing you ever saw she spins along so
blissfully nothing rattles everything is in
perfect harmony and stays that way

   sometimes though she gets out of bed
wrong foot foremost and then i have to pat
her on the back and humor her once in a
while i get out of patience because every-
thing goes wrong i fume and cuss but that
doesnt help matters and then all of a
sudden she will come out of her sulks and
actually seem to grin at me and start in
running the prettiest you ever saw

   ive handled a good many engines in
my over twoscore years of service and when
the time came to part with those i was fond
of it always caused me a good deal of re-
gret when it comes to getting acquainted
with a new engine i go about it cautiously

   you have to treat her with a lot of def-
erence and respect at first until you win her
confidence then if shes the right sort
all goes well as long as youre together if

shes not you live in torment its as bad
as being unhappily married and its about
as hard to get a divorce from an engine that
has been assigned to you as it is from an
uncongenial wife

   a bad engine will annoy you by starting
or stopping hard or with a jerk she will
take a lot of steam-eat up a lot of coal-
and be contrary in a thousand different
ways some are treacherous

  they will run along for days as pleas-
ant as pie and then all of a sudden when
youre least expecting it they will fly into
a tantrum that may land you in the ditch
some will stay neat and clean with very lit-
tle care while others will be continually
untidy no matter how much you may work
over them

   my experience is that the engines with
odd numbers-odd combinations of num-
bers i mean-like  or the four ones
eleventy-leven are unlucky a good many
others think the same way i quit a west-
ern road once where they made me run a
 because she had such a mean dispo-
sition

   an engineer who was running -
same pattern-took out  next day be-
cause his own engine was being repaired
and  went off the track and killed him
before he had gone twenty miles i heard
she had one accident after another after
that and finally they took her off and re-
built her-gave her another number too

she had some temper

  -that didnt change her temper at all
though and ill bet that if she isnt com-
pletely smashed up by this time shes on her
way doing mischief still

   i know that  you are talking about
broke in another engineer who was standing
by listening to the conversation  i had
to take her out a few times when i was the
swing man on that run and i was always
afraid of her

   shes dead and gone now glory be i
saw a man yesterday who told me that she
was in a head-on collision last week after
she smashed she toppled over and rolled
down a high embankment she was only
fit for the scrap-heap when they picked her
up but she was wicked to the last she
scalded her engineer and fireman so badly
that theyll be laid up for a long time

   ive run a good many different engines
too he went on  and there has never been
coddling the old girl



two of them alike just like people lots
of them ive thought so much of that when
they were about used up from hard work
and i was running some new natty-looking
gal just out of the shops id go over to the
roundhouse or to the tracks where they were
working every day or so just to give them
a pat to show that id not forgotten them
manys the time ive done that

   i never cared to set eyes more than once
on any of the man-killers ive known you
may believe it or not but its the truth that
there are engines so evil-minded and dan-
gerous theres no living with them theyre
as treacherous as a man-eating tiger they
seem to take solid comfort in hurting people

engine with ideas of her own

  i honestly believe that theres engines
that are plumb crazy-engines that ought
to be in lunatic asylums i knew one once
that seemed to have what the doctors call
a homicidal mania-she was always mur-
dering people

   if that engine had been brought up for
trial before a jury of engineers ill bet they
would have sentenced her to death on the
scrap-heap without leaving their seats

   my experience has been announced a
third engineer who had joined-the group-
 my experience has been that if i start out
on my run in bad humor my engine gets
cranky too if im sick she acts just about
as bad as i feel youd think that she
would try to cheer me up by acting right
but shes just that sympathetic that she
cant seem to enjoy herself a bit when im
not feeling well

   i used to think that this talk about en-
gines having minds and moods was all non-
sense that was when i was a young man
though and had my first engine there
was a pal of mine who had the run opposite
me on the rock island in those days he
and i talked it over and decided that wed
see if there was anything in it so we
agreed to make a trial of it with  he
had his ideas about adjusting her and i
had mine

   each of us marked the adjustments he
favored and i tried running her on his way
of fixing her and he on mine he couldnt
do anything with her and no more could i

   she would buck all the time yet shed
run all right for him when hed keyed her
up to suit himself and she was a hummer
when i took her out on my adjustments

the changes that either of us made were so
trifling that no mechanical engineer would
say that they would affect her running at all
but they did

   that set me to thinking and the way i
experimented with  was cruel its a
wonder she didnt lose her temper with me
but she seemed to know why she was being
made to suffer the way she was and she
never whimpered

    i gave it up after a while and if i told
you what i believe about engines now youd
think i was crazy

  the other engineers in the group nodded
their heads gravely

   i guess weve all been through pretty
much the same thing one of them re-
marked  we dont talk about such mat-
ters very much except among ourselves and
our families simply because other folks
cant understand and wed hate to be
laughed at

   but theres a lot more to running an
engine than knowing the mechanism per-
fectly and sitting in the cab and pulling the
lever-a lot of things that a man learns on
moonlight nights when the shadows on the
track confuse one or on the nights of fog
when the signals arent clear lots of things
a man cant put into words

watch em like children

  an engineer especially one of the fast
runners is jealous in the extreme of his
engine go into any roundhouse where the
big liundred-tonners with seventy-nine-
inch drivers are being cleaned up after
their return home or are being made ready
for a trip out and you will find engineers
standing about carefully watching every
move of the wipers and machinists and oc-
casionally taking a hand themselves

  an hour or two before she is ready to go
out the engineer himself goes into executive
session and spends his time tightening a
nut here or loosening a bolt there inspecting
with his own eyes every atom of the great
mass of complex machinery that he loves

  his constant companion is an oil-can
filled with his own especial kind of dope
for few engineers are content with the qual-
ity of the oil that the company furnishes
and each has his own secret lubricant which
he compounds himself and which he guards
as jealously as the alchemist used to guard
the formula by which he hoped to transmute
base metals into gold


the railroad mans magazine

  the passenger engineer generally runs
only on alternate days when he is at home
and the man who runs opposite to him is
out with his old gal he puts in his time
as best he can until he hears her whistle
standing in the doorway of his home watch
in hand a mile away perhaps he listens
with strained attention

   there comes dick and the  old gal
ninety seconds late by george shes
coming in on one side if folks knew what
they were riding behind theyd quit travel-
ing its a wonder to me that they ever let
that man run an engine

  huh didnt whistle for that crossing
until he was almost onto it took her
around that curve on one wheel whats
the use of fixing up the  old gal  when they
let a man take her out that dont know how
to humor her

   shell be as mad and cranky as can be
to-morrow ill go down to the roundhouse
to-night as soon as dick is out of the way
and look her over and see if i cant patch
things up

  dick by the way is probably just as
competent and as experienced as the man
that runs opposite to him the next day
it is dicks turn to wait watch in hand
for his favorite to come in he too criti-
cizes freely to himself the manner in which
his rival for the old gals affectionate
regard is running her

  occasionally when she comes in on time
to the second and the engineers keen
senses are unable to pick any flaws with a
twinkle in his eye he will slip his watch
back in his pocket and remark to his wife
as he goes into the house  shes all right
to-night shes certainly a hummer and
no mistake 

  the engineers wife shares with her
husband the belief in the almost human
qualities of the big engine that helps earn
their bread for she pays the unwilling
compliment of being jealous of her

   my husband thinks more of his engine
than he does of me and the children she
remarks  hes always worrying about
her if one of the children is sick he
sleeps soundly enough but when his old
engine comes in with a sore throat or a
tender toe hell stay down to the roundhouse
half the night tinkering with her or watch-
ing the machinists

   there are lots of things he could do at
home on his off-days but theres no holding
him when his  old gal  comes in he ljas

to hurry down to see if she is all right be-
fore he can think of anything else some-
times he will come back with a long face
as if some one was dead

   if i dont ask him what is the matter-
i used to at first-he will say  shes feel-
ing pretty sick this morning ill be gone
some little time fixing her up dont know
how ill ever get over the run with her un-
less i do shes getting old and i have to
pat her on thejback a good deal to keep her
up to her work nowadays

   i feel sometimes like going down there
and throwing stones at her yes i am
jealous of her i wish my husband would
quit railroading and get into some other
business

   it makes me laugh sometimes though
to see how jealous my husband is of dick
the man that runs opposite to him dick
is just as jealous of my husband too they
are friendly enough of course to each oth-
ers faces but dicks wife and i have often
compared notes about how they talk about
each other at home

   why my husband has a lot of the holts
and things scored with tiny file marks to
show just where he sets them-just how
far they should be screwed up in his judg-
ment-and when he finds them disturbed
in the slightest degree he growls like a big
bear dicks wife says her husband is the
same funny isnt it

  no engineer can explain the big ma-
chines moods-why she runs smoothly or
why she is stiff rheumatic and contrary
to the most vexatious degree on different
days the casual stranger may inquire
and will receive a gruff answer  weather
or  dont know but to the man who the
engineer knows is in sympathy with him
he will theorize by the hour and all his
ideas will be based on the foundation that
there is something human about the ma-
chine no engineer has gone so far as to
assert that ejigines have souls but most of
them give their favorites almost every other
human attribute

  the engine that consumes comparatively
little coal and steams easily is the fire-
mans favorite as soon as he becomes
thoroughly familiar with the mechanism
his discrimination between various locomo-
tives grows keener and by the time he is
rated as an engineer he has joined the rest
of the brotherhood in their settled likes and
dislikes of the fickle or trustworthy giant-
esses that he drives over the steel

                   the story of a desperate man
                   of the rio grande country

newly appointed vice-presi-
dent drummed on the desk
with his fingers swung around
on his chair until he faced the
reporter and smiled the re-
porter srsiiled in return for he
was sufficient of a judge of human nature
to know the vice - presidents mind had
gone way back in the pjist and that he
was thinking of something decidedly
pleasant

  when you strike a man in this sort of a
mood the odds are that you will get some-
thing out of him so the
reporter took his note-
book and pencil and pre-
pared to write

   the star thinks its
readers would be inter-
ested in learning how a
man once a section-hand
at a- dollar and two bits
a day rose to be vice-
president and general
manager of three thou-
sand miles of railroad

  its mainly a ques-
tion of opportunity said
mr west opportu-
nity and hunch you
know what a hunch is

i suppose

  the reporter having
played more than one
game of poker defined it
as  a feeling that led one
to stay in a pot with only
a pair of trays

  mr west nodded

   you have pretty near-
ly hit it except that my

     	r r

 hunch led me to stay in the pot without any
 cards to draw to

did you win

if you call a bullet in the shoulder
and saving fifty thousand dollars winning
then i won

 thats the story i was told to ask you
 about said the newspaper man

the vice-president settled back in his
chair he was a big man with a bulldog
hitch to his right shoulder that had given
him the name of fighting bob

 opportunity and hunch my boy and

accept-you blackguard i have a notion to kill you
            


the railroad mans magazine

 if any of you want any of the same
medicine let him drop his hands

something to fight for a winning com-
bination those three are unbeatable
usually the impelling force behind the
other two is a desire for wealth power or
a woman in my case it was a woman
the rest have come too but if it hadnt
been for the woman god bless her id
still be a section-hand

  this is the story that the vice-president
told

  a railroad mans life at best is pretty
tough there is room on top for just one
to every thousand underneath and if the
man above takes a dislike to the one be-
low he has more ways of taking it out

on him than a cat has

lives

  i always thought my-
self a pretty good snipe
as we called the section
men out there until i
ran up against superin-
tendent peck and the
cause of our quarrel-
the girl

  it might seem funny
to you that two men in
such different positions
should be courting the
same girl but this was
in the early days in the
west when one man was
as good as another

   at first it was a neck-
and-neck race between
peck and me for her
favor then i began to draw a little bit
ahead peck got sore and things began
to happen

as a first move be tried to have me fired
from the road but failed because the fore-
man was a good friend of mine and re-
fused to do it without some reason

peck then quietly passed the word to
the roadmaster with the result that next
pay-day my full time came in together
with my discharge i dont blame the
roadmaster he was an old man with a
large family and peck said that either he
or i should go but it was pretty hard on
me i was cut off in the dead of winter
without a job or any possibility of getting
one with little money ten dollars would
have bought me and i knew peck would
blacklist me so no other road would give
me work

under these conditions there was but
one thing to do i packed my grip kissed
the girl good-by and went to san an-
tonio the nearest large town there were
some shops there and by changing my
name i was able to secure work

  everything was going nicely i was
putting money in the bank each month
getting a letter every day to show that
one had not forgotten me and there was
some talk of making me foreman

  then one day peck happened to stroll
in a week later they informed me that
my services were no longer required no
reason was given mind you no criticism
of my work nothing-they simply did not
want me
against great odds



  it looked as though peck would not be
satisfied until he had driven me out of the
country i had never done any work but
railroad work and with the superintendent
able to get me discharged on every road
in the state i saw nothing but mexico
where his influence did not extend before
doing that however i wanted to go back to
red oak see my friends and ask the girl
to go with me as my wife

  my temper is hard to kindle but once
started is harder to stop for the second
time i packed my clothes because peck had
the whip hand of me

  if any train ever deserved the name of
local that train to red oak took first prize
it was composed of a switcli-engine a
baggage - car that looked like a lumber-
wagon and two ancient day-coaches

  the last car was divided in half the
rear portion being used as a smoker to
the rear i went lighting my pipe i be-
gan to smoke gloomily and cuss the super-
intendent

  i didnt want to go to mexico i wanted
only to go back to red oak marry and
settle down

   hadnt been in the smoker long when
peck entered you would think that after
a man had caused you to be discharged
twice he would keep away from you but
if he hadnt come in and sat down beside
me just then there would be another vice-
president sitting in this office just now

  peck had a sarcastic grin on his face
he pushed my grip over lighted a big fat
cigar with a red band around it to make
me ashamed of my pipe and after lie had
it going well turned to me

   i suppose he said between puffs
you have been fired again

  yes thanks to you

   it is too bad a young man of your
ability cant stay sober long enough to hold
a job he said looking at me out of the
corner of his eyes

  so thats your game is it i ex-
claimed you intend spreading it around
red oak that i was discharged for drink-
ing

   its what they told me at the shops
in san antonio lie replied

   then its a lie   i cried hotly  i
was discharged because you said so

  he edged away from me when he saw
my anger we sat in silence for some
moments then he said

   isnt there some way we can fix this

up you are nearly broke and out of a
job suppose i were to offer you any
section on the line except no 

  this was the red oak section

  on what condition i asked sus-
piciously

  cant you guess he asked

   no  i snapped

   its easy enough to guess he said
looking everywhere but at me you can
have the yards at forbestown with a rake-
off on feeding the men sell all the old ties
you take out or if that isnt enough you
can have an extra gang-all by keeping
away from a certain person in red oak

  i think i would have thrown him out
of the window then and there if my atten-
tion had not been attracted by three men
who entered just then

  there was something about them-i
cant explain to this day what it was-that
made me watch them intently they were
different in face and dress from any other
men in that part of the country

  instead of wearing their guns where
everybody could see them they were hid-
den in their back pockets what called
my attention to them was a black mask
sticking out of one mans pocket

  as they brushed past us the one in the
lead slipped a note into the superintend-
ents hand

  call it hunch premonition or what you
like i had an aching desire to see that
slip of paper somehow i knew it affected
me and my future bending over with his
back to me he pretended to take it from
his pass-book he read it carefully and
instead of putting it back he thrust it into
his vest when he turned to me expecting
his answer i had it all planned out

   do you accept my proposition   he
asked briskly

   accept-you blackguard   i yelled
 i have a notion to kill you 

  i threw my arms around him bending
him back on the arm of the seat until his
bones cracked the car was instantly in
an uproar some of the men fought to get
out of our way others to separate us
coming quickly iii our direction were the
three who had last entered but before they
could reach us my hand had slipped about
pecks body and into his vest pocket

   now you can go  i said

  i gave him a shove that sent him sprawl-
ing into the aisle

  the car quieted down again peck did


the railroad mans magazine

not dare to lodge a complaint fearing that
i would repeat the conversation that had
brought on the trouble i took the paper
and went out on the platform

  it began without an address nor did it
have a signature it read

   the stuff is on the train as you said we
  do the job at mcelvaney keep out and you
  get your share

  if there were any crooked work to be
done-mcelvaney was an ideal spot it
was at the top of a steep grade and the
road curved to within a hundred miles of
the mexican border a hundred miles isnt
much ground for a man to cover on a
good horse especially if he could start the
trip with plenty of water-and mcelvaney
had a tank

  neither was it difficult to guess what the
stuff was red oak and the adjoining
town did not have banks and on satur-
days they required considerable cash to
take care of their cowboy and ranch trade

  this was friday so by putting two and
two together i formed a pretty good guess
of what was going to happen still i
might be mistaken there was a  chance
that the three men were railroaders the
job might be legitimate and the stuff
could easily be dynamite or tools

  i went back to my grip found my re-
volver and slipped it into my pocket
then i went through the other car but
could find no more suspicious characters
this rather upset my calculations as it
hardly seemed possible that three men
would attempt to hold up two cars filled
with cattlemen nine-tenths of whom were
armed

  the more i thought of it the more fool-
ish it seemed after calling myself an old
woman with a bad attack of nerves

  three hours later it was night but so
bright outside that you could have read a
paper the moon was full throwing its
light over the gray desert like a silver cloth
a slinking coyote barked at us from the
shadow of a mesquit tree cactus and
sage-brush glided by like ghostly shadows
presently we began to slow up as we
climbed the grade of which mcelvaney
was the summit

  suddenly the three men as though by
some preconceived signal rose and walked
toward the engine two continued on
while the third stopped and turned his
back to the door as if he were guarding it

  i stood up intending to follow when a
hand was laid on my arm it was peck

   i want to apologize he said quite
frankly holding out his hand  we all
make mistakes and mine was a bad one
here sit down he pulled me into a seat
beside him now if you are willing to
let bygones be bygones im in earnest about
offering you a section any place you want
not even barring red oak we will fight
it out squarely from now on

  there was such a change in the man
and in the proposition he made that i was
dumfounded it should have put me on
my guard after all the injury he had
done me to have him turn around and act
like a white man was too much

   who were those three men   i asked
still thinking of the paper in my pocket

   what three men 

  i pointed to the one leaning against the
door

    oh   he said and paused just a frac-
tion of a second  they are linesmen
there is a telegraph-wire broken at mcel-
vaney and the company has sent them-out
to repair it

  there was just a flicker to his eyelid
that told me he lied before i could more
than brush him aside and step into the
aisle the train came to a stop with a
grinding crash

  many of the passengers were thrown out
of their seats and before any of us were
aware the man at the door his face now
covered by a black mask had drawn two
revolvers

   stand where you are  he ordered
any man who moves gets a bullet put
your hands up-quick 

  the hands of every man in the car were
thrust in the air-all except one

  the shock of the train when it stopped
had thrown me forward with such violence
that it rendered me partially unconscious
as from a long distance i heard the orders
of the bandit and the scramble of the men
trying to obey him

  when i came to the car was absolutely
quiet but for an occasional nervous cough
i quickly took note of my surroundings
my fall had wedged me in between two
seats so tightly that i could scarcely move
my feet were the only part of my body vis-
ible from the end of the car above me
was a fat drummer and a farmer boy both
pasty white

   as quietly as possible i told the drummer
against great odds



to move over so as
to give me room to
get my gun from my
pocket holding my
breath i began to
squirm slowly around

  it was not bravery
on my part - simply
self - defense i had
worked too hard for
that money it meant
too much to me to
give it up to the first
man who wanted it

  a commotion oppo-
site me helped my
movements an otd
white-haired
man unaccustomed to
the tiring position
dropped his arms at the same instant a
shot resounded through the car and the old
man toppled over a crimson stain dyeing his
shirt front

   if any of you want any of the same
medicine let him drop his hands  roared
the bandit

  previous to this i had no intention of
doing anything but save my money but with
this brutal outrage committed without any
reason before my eyes i found myself see-
ing red

  so as not to attract the bandits attention
i twisted myself around until my head was
where my feet had been

  revolver in hand i leaned out the rob-
ber saw me-but a fraction of a second too
late

  my bullet reached him just as squarely
as his had reached the old man

  i jumped to my feet and ran out at the
rear of the car

  as i did so one bullet then another
whistled close to my head behind me
some one was shouting  hands up  sev-
eral more shots were fired i jumped nim-
bly over the railing and ran straight to a
pile of ties

  crouching behind these i had the whole
train in full view ahead by the engine was
a group composed of the conductor en-
gineer fireman and two brakesmen guard-
ed by a bandit

  there were two more in the baggage-car
one at either end of the first coach another
standing at the forward end of the rear car
and-could i believe my eyes-there
was peck himself holding up the passen-

after tes min-
utes slow work
i was able to
put my hand on
a sweat-stained
flank

  gers in place of the robber that i had just
wounded

  so he had thrown off the mask there
could be no doubt now that the baggage-
car held more than the usual amount of
money

  the superintendent had learned this and
staking all on one throw was risking not
only his reputation but his life

  if i had not caught him robbing his own
company i would have been content to get
away in safety with my money but with
the memory of those bullets whistling so
close to my head and of all the other in-
juries suffered at his hands i determined
that i would pit my strength and courage
against his

  it was not longer a question of the rail-
road  but peck and i had a little fight of
our own to settle-with the odds seven to
one in his favor

  one hundred yards away stood the water-
tank-lonely and desolate-its water drip-
ping into the desert sand

  on every side as far as the eye could
reach stretched the prairie broken only by
the dwarfed mesquit


the railroad mans magazine

  i saw what i had been searching for-a
dark figure that moved ever so slightly
dropping on my knees and keeping the pile
of ties between me and the train after ten
minutes slow work i was able to put my
hand on a sweat-stained flank seven

  another followed and another until there
were five strung out

  the rear door opened anti peck with the
revolver still in his hand lightly vaulted
the railing and joined the procession

  they seemed to realize there were only
two horses left and the retreat became a
foot-race for life or death the man with
the bag and peck reached the horses first
without touching the stirrups they sprang
into the saddles and without even casting a
look backward at the comrades they were
deserting turned their fetrses heads and
galloped away

except for our
clothes there
was very little
difference
between us

horses saddled and bridled were standing
patiently with dieir bridle reins on the
ground

  four of them were still blowing hard
showing in what manner the bandits had
received their reenforcements one by one

i	threw the bridles over their heads and
slapping them hard sent them back over the
route they had come three remained-two
that had been ridden and one fresh one
mounting the latter i followed the four
that had gone ahead

  as i jogged slowly along i saw what i
had expected a bandit with a heavy grip
in his hand dropped off the baggage-car and
raced for the horses

from one end to another the train began
to blaze with shots two of the four re-
maining men fell at the first volley the
others had little chance against that train-
load of infuriated victims leaving them
to their fate i drummed on my horses ribs
with my heels and swinging westward
started in pursuit of peck and the man with
the bag

there was no danger of being unable to
overtake them for their horses were already
half-blown while mine was comparatively
fresh

what i would do when i came alongside
the two desperate armed men i did not
know i was simply following my hunch

  one hundred miles doesnt look much on
a map a mere pin-length at most a couple
of hours ride on a train but try it some
time at night the moon high in the heavens
through an unknown country where even-
tall cactus appears like a desperado await-
ing your approach with a death-dealing
gun and every shadow a shapeless terror

  we followed a sort of trail where the
sand was packed hard as macadam and my
horses hoofs rang loud in my ears i rode
on and on without a sight of the fugitives
my horse was a good one and needed little
against great odds



urging yet by the time the moon had gone
down he could scarcely go faster than a trot

    what condition the other two were in was
 made plain by the marks of their dragging
 footsteps and the drops of blood from their
 sides where the spurs had been brutally
 used

    several times there were marks where one
 of the horses had fallen i also found in
 the middle of the road a hat with the initials
 r h p inside

    as the moon sank below the horizon and
 the dawn broke my horse stopped his sham-
 bling gait so suddenly that it almost threw
 me from the saddle he stood trembling in
 every limb and refused to move until i dis-
 mounted and led him forward by the bridle

   then i saw the reason barring our
 path was a horse outstretched on the sand
 and breathing heavilj

close by was the sprawling figure of a
 man it wasnt peck as i went forward
he sat up straight staring at me stupidly
i disarmed him taking two revolvers and a
mask

    well i said when the fellow was able
 to talk how did this happen that isnt
your horse where is peck

     i was waiting for him like a pal should
 when he comes up behind me and hits me
 over the head with his gun then he takes
 my horse and rides on a nice pal he is
 the man said

   there was only one thing to do peck
 still had the money and it was my duty to
 follow him

    the odds were now cut from two against
 one to even as for the other robber after
 studying him a few minutes i hit upon a
 plan he was about my build both of us
 were clean shaven and except for our
 clothes there was little difference between us

     get up and take off that coat and your
 trousers i ordered

    he drew sullenly back doubtful of my
 intentions i had to thrust my revolver close
 to his face to emphasize my meaning we
 made the change in silence there was lit-
 tle doubt the man would be there when i
 returned a posse was already on his track
 ahead were peck and myself on either side
 lay the desert he was as good as caught

    it took but little riding to catch up with
 peck his mount was in a bad way stag-
 gering from side to side with every step

    on seeing me peck forced the poor brute
 into a feeble trot which however lasted
 only a few hundred yards

   in the distance we could see the green
foliage of the trees marking the rio grande
-the border line of mexico-and pecks
destination

   seeing that he could not reach the line
before i caught up with him he drew his
gun and took a shot at me

   the bullet whistled unomfortably close
i was half minded to shoot in return but
the desire to capture him alive overcame
my fear and i waved the bandits sombrero
about my head so he would think my inten-
tions were not hostile

  luckily the hat was of a conspicuous
color white with a red band around the
crown and this and my clothes gave peck
the idea i had intended-that i was the
companion he had rapped over the head
with his gun

  he permitted me to get close but kept
his hand on his hip ready for trouble should
i prove vindictive i rode up behind him
the hat pulled low over my face my chin
sunk on my chest as though in pain

  that was a nice trick you played on
me i growled hitting a pal on the head
and taking his horse away from him

   its all in the game he said shifting
the satchel from one hand to the other
where did you get the horse

  the same way you did took it from
another man

   i could see him looking at it with spec-
ulative eyes and knew he was meditating
some plan to make an exchange he must
have made a quick decision for he motioned
me to ride alongside

    and give you a chance to hit me another
crack on the head not much i pro-
tested

  he shrugged his shoulders and without
looking backward rode on

  here was my opportunity gradually
foot by foot inch by inch i drew nearer
my horses head was on a line with his
horses tail it drew up to the others
cantle it crept beside the girth on to the
pommel-and my hands were stretched out
to seize the superintendent

   just at the critical moment he happened
to turn and saw my white face not two feet
from his own

   with an oath he jerked out his revolver
before i could withdraw my hands there
came a stunning report like a dozen peals
of thunder rolled into one

   a terrific blow and i reeled in my saddle
through a maze of smoke i saw his face


the railroad mans magazine

wrinkle into its old sarcastic smile his
thumb was busy with the hammer which
seemed to be caught in some way between
me and eternity were only a few seconds

  i flung myself toward him my right
arm encircled his neck the horses pulled
apart and we crashed heavily to the ground

he lay flat on the ground arms and legs
extended to their fullest extent scarcely
breathing a trickle of blood from a gash in
his forehead showed the extent of his injur

  it was what caused the cut that made
me laugh a fall from a horse on the soft
sand is not a dangerous thing but peck-

had struck his head on the lock of the
satchel containing the stolen money

  and so said the reporter snapping
shut his book you recovered fifty thousand
dollars for the railroad they in gratitude
made you road-master and from that you
worked up to your present position

   you left out the most important part
said the vice-president  i got the girl

if you dont see a stop or a slow signal once in a while better suspect
the signaling system there might be a wreck and you might be
in it no mans luck is insured against interruption
-sayings of the supervisor

  when my senses returned the sun was
high in the heavens my shoulder burned
like liquid fire and it was only by using
the stirrup of one of the patient horses that
i was able to regain my feet

  i stared dumbly wondering how i had
escaped and then in spite of my suffering
i laughed out loud for once in his life
the superintendent had overstepped himself

between me and eternity were
only a few seconds
  record runs of millionaires

by george jean nathan

 when the average individual is in a hurry to get from one part of the
 country to another he generally has to content himself with a pull-
 man berth on a limited train if however he is sufficiently endowed
 with dollars to consider the spending of a few thousands with the same degree
 of equanimity with which he might contemplate buying an ordinary mileage
 book it is not unlikely that he will charter a special train and strive to break
 all records between his starting point and destination

     in recent issues of the railroad mans magazine the record runs of
 the jarrett  palmer special and scottys coyote special were described
 at length but since these mad dashes across the continent other fast runs
 have been made which have made distances shorter than ever before

     not all of these runs were the result of mere whims many were made
 to reach the bedside of a dear relative before the arrival of the grim reaper

 - whatever the cause these contests with time are always interesting and
 many of them have added dramatic chapters to the history of the great steel
 ways

no matter how thick the traffic a clear track can generally be secured
for the man in a hurry who can foot
the bill

   not be procured immediately but the sun-
   set limited was leaving in a few hours and
   the railroad officials agreed to attach the
    ranger mr gatess private car

    arrangements were then completed for
  a special train to be made up and waiting
  on his arrival at yuma arizona which
  would make the run across the continent
  in the fastest time that schedules would
  allow

a long run to the doctor

     an engine buffet car and three coaches
   for ballast were standing on a side-track
   at yuma and no time was lost coupling
   the  ranger  to them

at half past five oclock on thursday
february  the special pulled out of the
little western town on its three-thousand-
mile journey while the wires beside the

be whisked across
country at the fast-
possible speed then
look out for new rec-
ords during recent years a number of
rich americans have found the regular
schedules and the fastest trains too slow or
the importance attending their journey too
great and have engaged special trains to
have the right of way over everything to get
them to their destination the most recent
case on record is that of charles g gates a
new york broker who was suddenly taken
ill in san diego california and wanted to
get home to new york as fast as steam
could carry him-or faster

  mr gates hurried to the telephone and
rang up the southern pacific companys
office at san diego a special train could

track hummed with messages arranging a
special right of way over all the roads it
would traverse

   it switched from the southern pacific to
the rock island at el paso texas and
left that city at  am on the following
day for the run to chicago

   just out of el paso it made one hundred
miles in one hundred minutes at hutch-
inson kansas the special had- gained six
hours and forty-six minutes on the golden
state limited which left yuma forty-six
minutes later

  near volland kansas just west of
topeka it had its first set-back a train
ahead had been derailed and the special
was forced to wait two hours for the block-
ade to be lifted mr gates fretted until
they were under way again nevertheless
when the train reached topeka at  pm
on saturday february  its speed had av-
eraged forty-five miles an hour since the de-
parture from el paso at every stop john
w gates who was in port arthur texas
was informed by telegraph of the condition
of his son and mrs charles g gates at
her home in madison avenue new york
also received bulletins

without a stop

  the special drove through topeka with-
out a stop and got to kansas city at 
pm a fresh locomotive was ready and
the train was off again at  the offi-
cials at el paso had calculated that the
train would be in chicago between four
and five oclock on sunday morning true
to their predictions it arrived on time and
left for new york on the lake shore at
five oclock

   the nine hundred and seventy-four miles
from chicago to new york were covered
in sixteen hours and twenty-seven min-
utes the final lap of one hundred and
forty-three miles from albany being made
in one hundred and forty-one minutes
this is the record from chicago to new
york but it is twenty minutes slower than
the time made by frank a vanderlips
train running west from new york to chi-
cago in 

  the five hundred and thirty-five miles
from chicago to buffalo were reeled off in
five hundred and twenty-three minutes
while the four hundred and forty miles
from buffalo to new york were covered in
four hundred and sixty-four minutes

 twenty-one minutes were lost on the mo-
 hawk division of the new york central
 between syracuse and albany because of a
 local train ahead getting irito trouble

record of the run

    the engineer who brought the train from
 albany to high bridge was e a clem-
 ens and the fireman was e a cooper a
 change of engines was made at high
 bridge when the electric locomotive in
 charge of george snyder picked up the train
 and brought it into new york

    when mr gates paid his bills he found
 that the trip from coast to coast had cost
 him six thousand dollars at the rate of
 about two dollars a mile the cost of the
 run from chicago to new york was one
 thousand eight hundred and twenty-five
 dollars which figures up to a charge of
 two dollars for every minute that the special
 was on the rails

new york to chicago in sixteen hours

 few runs have proved more thrilling than
 that participated in by frank a vanderlip
 president of the national city bank of new
 york who during the early part of 
 started from new york in a vain effort to
 beat the grim reaper to chicago where his
 aged mother lay dying

 when at the point of retiring for the
 night mr vanderlip received a telegram
 from his brother-in-law in chicago saying
 that his mother had been prostrated by a
 sudden and serious attack of pneumonia
 seizing the telephone mr vanderlip noti-
record runs of millionaires



 fied the new york central authorities that
 he wanted a special made up for him at
 once

  fifty minutes later the train pulled out
of the grand central station it was com-
posed of four cars mr vanderlips private
car and three empties for braking purposes
six of the most powerful locomotives of the
new york central and lake shore roads
were subsequently used and the crews were
shifted at albany syracuse buffalo to-
ledo and elkhart indiana

run made history

  the train-despatchers had received blan-
ket orders to give the special right of way
over everything and several passenger-
trains were side - tracked during the run
every change of locomotives but one was
accomplished in less than a minute at
elkhart three minutes were lost through an
unavoidable delay

  the vanderlip race against death should
live in the history of railroading it estab-
lished the fastest time between new york
and chicago the train reaching the la
salle street station at seven minutes after
three oclock the next afternoon sixteen
hours and seven minutes from new york
almost an hour better than the previous
record of seventeen hours and two hours
faster than the schedules of the twentieth-
century limited and the pennsylvania spe-
cial the entire run of  miles was made
in exactly  minutes making an aver-
age of  miles a minute

  the special was brought into chicago by
engineer mark floyd and conductor james
wisher

  throughout the race mr vanderlip kept
begging the engineer for more speed he
received no messages as to his mothers
condition en route and lived in constant
fear that death would beat him to the
bedside

death wins the race

  when the train reached englewood sta-
tion he jumped into a waiting automobile
and started at top speed for his mothers
home in madison avenue

mother he asked as the door opened

   she died at ten minutes to three was
the reply-which was the very time the
special had pulled into the englewood
station

  the detailed schedule of the vanderlip
specials race with death follows

     left new york at midnight eastern time

     arrived in buffalo  am- miles in

  a railroad race with death that takes
rank with the above occurred several years
ago when dr w meyer and two nurses
started from new york in a record-break-
ing run to the scene of a wreck on the new
york central near lyons new york in
which mrs newman erb wife of the vice-
president of the pere marquette railroad
had been seriously injured

  accompanied by mr erbs son-in-law
and his wife the physician and nurses left
the metropolis on a special composed of the
fastest engine available three day-coaches
and a private car the special was ordered
at seven oclock in the morning when the
news of the disaster arrived and pulled out
at ten minutes to eight it was given a
clear track and whirled up the hudson at
the rate of a mile a minute

 miles in  minutes

  at albany dr meyer appealed to the
engineer and conductor william lewis for
more speed and from albany to syracuse
all records were broken the distance to the
latter city from new york being made in
four and one-half hours after a quick
change of engines the train hurried on to
rochester the eighty-one intervening miles
being covered in seventy-four minutes the
run was all the more remarkable in view of
the fact that the engineer was compelled to
slow down six successive times

  the special covered the  miles from
new york to rochester in  minutes
breaking the record of the empire state
express by one hour  but death had beaten
the flying train by twenty minutes and
mrs erb had succumbed to her injuries
the race was the best piece of record work
in the history of the new york central to
that date


the railroad mans magazine

  late in march a year ago george w
perkins and his wife figured iu a spectacu-
lar railroad dash from stuart florida to
cleveland ohio where mr perkinss aged
mother lay dangerously ill receiving word
by telegraph of the latters critical condi-
tion while sojourning in florida mr per-
kins ordered a special to be made up for
him at once and within an hour the train
with himself and his wife on board pulled
out of stuart

  chattanooga tennessee was reached at
seven oclock of the same evening and cin-
cinnati at four oclock the following morn-
ing the night run of  miles between the
two cities having been made in  minutes

  it took four minutes to effect a change
of locomotives at cincinnati and mr per-
kins implored the new engineer to do all in
his power to make better time with the re-
sult that the distance of  miles to cleve-
land was covered in  minutes a wait-
ing automobile carried mr perkins to his
mothers bedside where he found that his
race from the south had not been in vain

he wouldnt wait for a special

  on september   frederic thomp-
son received word in new york that his
wife was dangerously ill in chicago he
immediately telephoned c f daly one of
the vice-presidents of the new york cen-
tral to prepare a special for his use

  after a short delay mr daly notified him
that it would be impossible to get up a
special for several hours at the very least
and advised mr thompson to take the em-
pire state express which was scheduled to
leave within the hour mr thompson fear-
ing that even the slightest delay might prove
costly told the official that he would leave
on the express but asked to have a special
in readiness for him at buffalo

  the vice-president assured him the special
would be waiting and the race began on
reaching buffalo mr thompson learned by
wire that his wifes condition was even more
aggravated than when he left new york
he boarded the special which was made up
of a locomotive and a single pullman and
bade the engineer make the run of his life

  chicago was reached at the rate of a mile
a minute and when mr thompson got to
his wifes side the turn for the better in
her condition was already marked

  ralph modjeskas successful train-dash
from montreal to the pacific coast to reach

his mother before she died was another feat
which has attracted wide attention al-
though he did not have a special the crews
of the regular trains exerted themselves to
their utmost in his behalf news received
along the line of his mothers steady decline
spurring them on to their best efforts

hurrying to the doctor

  last year the country was startled by the
dramatic endeavor of charles talmadge a
los angeles millionaire to reach chicago
from santa fe in order to place himself
under the care of a specialist mr tal-
madge believed himself to be dangerously
ill and was positive that his one hope for
life rested in an operation

  mr talmadge was in santa fe on busi-
ness when he became suddenly ill he
dropped an important real-estate deal that
he had under way ordered a special consist-
ing of two cars and a locomotive and plead-
ed with the engineer to break every railroad
record in history on the run to chicago

  the train-despatchers along the atchison
topeka and santa fe were ordered to give
the special a right of way and the crew of
the latter were instructed by the officials of
the road to annihilate time in a way they
had never done before the race started
and the distance from the starting point to
kansas city was covered at a rate that made
a new record for the road

  when kansas city was reached however
mr talmadges condition had improved so
materially that the special was dismissed
and the rest of the journey was made on a
regular train

  mr talmadges race with what he be-
lieved to be death attracted unparalleled
attention in the -west and particularly in
towns that lay along the line of the rail-
road the news of the specials record-
breaking rim was flashed ahead and great
throngs of people gathered at the stations
to cheer on its rapid flight

to the bedside of his son

  of all the long-distance contests with the
grim reaper one that stands out from
among the others is the run made by henry
j mayham

  while in new york on business in feb-
ruary  mr mayham received a tele-
gram stating that his son was dying in
denver he left immediately on the penn-
record runs of millionaires



-sylvania limited for pittsburgh- and on
arriving there telegraphed division super-
intendent howland of the chicago bur-
lington and quincy in chicago asking for
a special car and engine to carry him on to
denver

  arriving in chicago at ten minutes after
nine oclock on the morning of february

	he left fifty minutes later from the
union station in general superintendent
hesslers private car coupled to a special
locomotive for the anxious fathers use

  a second wire that reached him a few
moments before the train pulled out in-
formed mr mayham that his son was sink-
ing rapidly he tearfully begged the offi-
cials to get him to denver in time to see his
boy before the end came and told them to
spare no expense to aid him in his race

  affected by his grief the railroad men
promised to get him to his destination with-
in twenty-four hours although the fastest
regular trains took thirty-two hours

   a clear track vas ordered for the special
all along the line and during the course of
the run fully half a dozen passenger-trains
were side-tracked the only person on the
special with mr mayham was conductor
murray

  at lincoln nebraska a traveling engi-
neer named dixon entered the cab and re-
mained during the rest of the run urging
each successive engineer to greater speed and
infusing him with sympathy for the father
whose heart was breaking in the car behind

  burlington  miles west of chicago

was reached in  minutes and albia
iowa  miles farther west in  min-
utes red oak iowa a distance of 
miles was reached in  minutes on the
straight stretches of track the rate of speed
was a mile a minute and better and even
in colorado during the one-hundred-and-
eighteen-mile climb from akron almost as
high a rate was maintained

  colorado was entered at twelve minutes
to two oclock the next morning and denver
at eight minutes to four tuesday february

	but death had won mr mayhams
son had died soon after midnight

  during the course of the run mr may-
ham had sent numerous telegrams to his
son telling him that he was coming and
asking him to keep up his hope two of
those telegrams were sent after the young
man had passed away

  when the special left chicago a snow-
storm was raging and the rails were wet
and slippery general manager brown of
the railroad said subsequently that the run
might have been made in half an hour less
time had this not been the case as it was
the distance of  miles between chicago
and denver was covered in  minutes
or eight minutes less than nineteen hours

  the previous record for the fastest long-
distance run had been made on october

	 when the lake shore special
flier made the  miles from new york
to chicago in seventeen hours and twenty
minutes the race with death from chicago
to denver cost mr mayham 

steel mail-cars only

a provision was inserted in the post-office
appropriation bill prior to its passage by
the house of representatives on january  that
the postmaster general shall not hereafter enter
into contracts for other than steel or non-com-
bustible railway mail-cars the stipulation that
after january   no wooden car shall be
used in any way for the railway mail service was

also added this gives the department five years
within which to  work off  the cars now in use
but it requires that the introduction of the steel
cars shall begin immediately these amendments
were adopted after a long debate replete with
statistics and accountsof fatalities to railway mail
clerks resulting from the type of cars now used
by the mail service

record for service it is of the atlantic
type passenger-engine and operates out of albu-
querque new mexico on the first district it
was received from the baldwin locomotive works
in april  and on may  went into service
being in charge of engineer g w shade and
fireman i l fouch it was used continuously

till october   four years and almost six
months before being sent to the shops for general
repairs during this time it had only one set of
hues and traveled  miles considering
the rough territory and the feed-water conditions
of that section it is an exceptionally good record
the engine was in charge of mr shade all this

in the trunk

 t nkte perkins paid out so

            much of his wages for spec-
            tacles trying to make out the

  	h numbers on the checks that
-a w he gave up the job soon after
his eyesight failed and i got
it said dell hawkins the old baggage
man

   before the old man died he used to
come down here quite frequent to sit with
me old perk was fond of his pipe and
never could enjoy it so well as among the
trunks

  well one cold and stormy night in the
middle of winter when it was about time
for the lightning express to put in a show

i took my lamp and went to find out how
she was

   i was not long finding out for as i
stood there i heard an awful smagh

the lightning express had run into a
switching engine at the east end of the yard

  that made things lively for a little
time but the wrecking gangs got the dam-
aged engines clear threw the broken bag-
gage-car on one side coupled another en-
gine on and the train with a very short
delay went on west leaving the baggage
piled up in this room to be sent on by the
morning train

   as i said before it was a cold night
and when the work was through i was only
too glad to get near the stove and have
another smoke with old perk he had
made up his mind not to go home that
night for fear of losing his way in the drifts

               began in the february railroad mans



    did you ever hear that story about
that trunk   said old perk

    i said  what trunk 

oh shaw ill tell you all about it

   and old perk told how one of the night
hands named tim was always coming in-
to the baggage-room to keep him company
as he said but perk used sometimes to
fall asleep and dream that tim was  going
through  the trunks

   tim had a sneaking kind o way

   well one night when old perk was
part asleep and part awake he thought he
saw tim try to open a bos

    what are you doing tim 

  tim said he was just tightening the
ropes round that trunk

   a few minutes after old perk was
aroused by a piercing shriek

  tim the trunk pilferer had unlocked
a trunk and raised the lid and while
stealthily feeling inside in the dim light for
what he could get had drawn out a ghastly
human hand and arm while a skeleton sat
grinning at him in the box

  poor tim he could not dropilifcold
hand he held in his it seemed to hold him
like a vise he fell on his knees shivered
and swooned away on the floor

   the medical students box nearly cost
poor tim his life the fright threw him
into a fever but i guess it cured him of
opening other people trunks

  when old perk had finished he fell
asleep i began to feel uncomfortable
the room smelled close my imagination
was excited

    i looked at the trunk suspiciously and
had a vague idea that all the lightning ex-
press baggage contained grinning skeletons

vanishing railroaders



   old perk snored to drive away un-
pleasant fancies i began counting how
many times he would snore before three
oclock

   he had snored just one hundred and
seventy-three times when i thought i heard
a groan

   you might have knocked me down with
a pick-i mean a tooth-pick-i felt so
scared

   i shook old perk rudely

    was that you perk  did you moan  

   i guess so he cried and went to sleep
again

  again i heard the same sound only
longer

   my hair stood up like bristles

   i felt a clammy moisture oozing through
my pores

  perk i said say that you groaned
didnt you perk if you did say so mr
perkins 

   i shook him so that there was no fear
he would go to sleep again

    dont make a noise like that perk
i said  its enough to frighten a man to
death you shouldnt do it lets have
another smoke 

   i had not time to light up a cry
quick and awful knocked pipe tobacco
and matches out of my hand

   i darted toward old perk his face
was blanched and his limbs trembling with
fright

    the box  the box   he said and fell
heavily to the floor scared out of his senses

  remembering i had a bottle of spirits
in the lock-up i put it to mr perkinss
mouth and then desperately- seizing a
hammer began to burst open the box on
which perk had sat

  between each blow was a stifled groan

  it was a hard box to open

  perk hurry up get that iron bar 

   the old man came to like a shot be-
tween us we loosened the lid

  the moment we had done so it flew
open

   i expected a horrible sight-a grinning
skeleton with aspiral-spring backbone or
something of that sort but bless you
there sat in the-trunk the loveliest young
girl her long blond hair streaming over
her neck and shoulders her large blue eyes
beaming with tears of thankfulness for
deliverance she tried to throw her arms
round my neck

  lend a hand perk i said to-

gether we lifted the poor stiffened young
lady out of her prison

    let me hold the dear creature on my
knee said perk

  no i said im going to hold her
on my knee  

    let me warm her then he said

     no i said  im baggage-master and
im going to do all the warming necessary
on this occasion

   so i petted her fondly and old perk
ran for water soon she began to talk a
little you should have heard her she
was so full of gratitude

   how came she in the trunk  

   she was an orphan-the adopted child
of a rich miserly old uncle he wanted to
get her through to cliff valley without pay-
ing her fare he thought he could do it
by putting her in that box with a few air-
holes as he was allowed one hundred
pounds of baggage free

  did he claim his baggage

  well i guess not sir he must have
been so scared when he found the box did
not reach cliff valley that he dared not
ask for it

  what became of the young woman

   well stranger that young woman is my
wife and as its getting toward morning i
guess ill just ask you to go and sit in the
waiting-room i want to go home and hold
the baby while she gets up and cooks break-
fast

old-time passes

afy train was approaching the suspen-
sion bridge near niagara some
years ago said the old con when it came
his turn to talk  i found a young man
aboard who could not pay his fare the
poor fellow was evidently in the last stages
of consumption he sat by himself and
his eyes were red as if he had been weep-
ing the laws of the company could not be
transgressed and as he had no money he
must leave the train no conductor knows
when a detective ma be watching him so
i led him with a heavy heart from his seat

   he was shivering with the cold and no
one moved or spoke until we reached the
door then a pretty girl arose from her
seat and with bright sparkling eyes de-
manded the amount of the invalids fare

   i told her eight dollars and she took
	the railroad mans magazine

that amount from her pocket-book and
kindly led the sick youth back to his seat

  the action put to shame several men
who had witnessed it and they offered to
pay half but the whole-souled girl refused
the assistance when our train arrived at
the next station the girl gave him sufficient
money to keep him overnight and send him
to his friends the next morning

  what was her name asked the hind
shack

  well as i said before i felt a little
cheap over the part i was forced to play in
the affair so i hunted her up and on the
first leisure evening called to return the
eight dollars this she indignantly refused
but i subsequently persuaded her to accept
of a suitable present

    well what else 

  the old con hesitated-and blushed be-
fore he replied

    i finally persuaded her to take me too
and shes just the best wife and mother on
the road

  watson the country conductor was
the next to talk

   i was running a train that was freight
one day and passenger the next i was
brakeman and switchman besides a couple
living at le mars iowa a station on our
road were anxious to have their child bap-
tized one day i had a minister aboard
and seeing him on the platform as we came
into le mars this couple got on the train
and the child was baptized while we were
going at the rate of thirty miles an hour
the happy couple got off at the next sta-
tion and took the first train home

   you remember pete littlejohn dont
you boys asked neal ruggles

  yes hes running somewhere in cali-
fornia said the old con

  littlejohn was coming down the grade
pretty fast one trip with his sweetheart
aboard when the engine ran into a lot of
solid beef throwing her off the track tem-
porarily but doing no other damage frag-
ments of one of the animals came through
the window or door and lodged in sweet-
hearts lap

  oh petes killed she screamed
jumping frantically to her feet and sur-
veying the bloody reminders  oh  petes
killed hes killed   and she refused to be
comforted until littlejohn made his appear-
ance and took her in charge

  tell us some more rug the idovs
yelled in unison

   rug went on as the boys relit-their pipes
and took easy attitudes for a long siege

  there was a station in pennsylvania
named hanna said ruggles when we
stopped there one day my brakeman thrust
his head inside the door as usual and
called out  hanna  loud and long a
young lady probably endowed with the
poetic appellation of hannah supposing
he was addressing her and shocked at his
familiarity on so short an acquaintance
frowned like a thunder-cloud and retorted
 shut your mouth 

  he shut it

   there was a brakeman on the old erie
who was called ned he thought he would
turn in a joke on his conductor the con
was collecting tickets one day from his pas-
sengers and all handed over their paste-
board save one old lady who sat next the
door near where ned stood

   she seemed to be reaching down to get
something she had dropped on the floor
when her time to pay camt she raised her
head and thus addressed the blushing con-
doctor

    i always when i travels carry my
money in my stockin for you sees nothin
can get at it there and id just thank you
young man just to reach it for me as im
so jammed in that i cant get to it i for-
got to git a ticket at the depot

  the con glanced at the other passen-
gers some of whom were laughing at his
plight one or two young ladies among
them blushed scarlet he hesitated and
finally beat a sudden retreat muttering
something about not charging old ladies
anyhow he was called on the carpet for
letting that passenger get by

   my run leads into a temperance town
which i will call alesburg division head-
quarters nobody drinks there and every
man woman and child is an apostle of
temperance every citizen is a temperance
lecturer and the bibulously inclined way-
farer must get a prescription before he can
get a drink

    prairie colic prevails there to an alarm-
ing extent and some men go about armed
with blank prescriptions ready for immedi-
ate service the moment the first symptom
comes on

  not long ago a well-known citizen of
alesburg somewhat noted for his crusades
against saloons hunted me up in chicago
which was several hundred miles from the
temperance town he wanted to know if
vanishing railroaders



i intended to take the train to alesburg
that night

    i told him that i did and noticed that
the symptoms of prairie colic were rapidly
developing he had come with some of the
boys he said and staying longer than
he had intended his money had run out and
his friends had left him

     very bad predicament indeed i said

 for a respectable temperance man of ales-
burg but i dont see what i can do for you
-the rules are very strict

    he replied that if he was made ac-
quainted with our general superintendent
he could secure a pass

    what entitled him to a pass i never
knew but i told him i would introduce
him to the super at once for i feared the
colic had him full force he left me and
returned in about fifteen minutes with at
least two more colics aboard i accom-
panied him to the supers office and intro-
duced him i noticcd that my colicky friend
handed the super his card

    the super seemed much perplexed in
his examination of that card finally he
returned it remarking with a peculiar
smile  sir there is some mistake this
seems to be a prescription from dr stig-
mole asking a certain druggist of alesburg
to give the bearer one quart of what i sup-
pose stands for whisky-for colic

    i left my fellow citizen searching nerv-
ously in his pockets for his card-but i
never learned how he got home

    i want to tell you about the fellow that
couldnt put it over jack stow we had a
very energetic tallow-pot named spielman
who got in the bad habit of doubling on his
pass the boys on the main-line passenger
resolved to stop it by punching the pass
every time it was shown

   the consequence was spielman had to
 make application for a new one the boys
not at all discouraged soon punched up
pass no  when spielman got his third
pass he procured a piece of sole-leatlier
the same size as the pass and about a quar-
ter of an inch thick on this he pasted his
pass

    it so happened that he got on jack
stows train our conductor intent on
ruining spielmans pass asked to see it
the weighty article was brought forth and
the conductors countenance dropped the
tallow-pot saw his discomfiture and said
with a smile

     i think i have stopped that punching

    	rr

business mr stow theres been a con-
spiracy against me

     yes i see replied stow scratching
his head  please raise that window a mo-
ment spielman and ill punch your pass

   spielman raised the window the
train was in full motion stow drawings a
small pocket pistol put a hole through the
center of the pass

     hows that for a punch   he said as
he went on down the car

    on the same division on which the last
incident occurred we had a telegraph oper-
ator named billy echart in the burnett
house at cincinnati billy was very popu-
lar with railway men many of whom
stopped at that establishment different
influences were brought to bear and he
finally got a passenger-train on the old cin-
cinnati hamilton and dayton without go-
ing through the usual apprenticeship

   ira a wood was general superintend-
ent i think though echart had never seen
him john lincoln who  learned  echart
the road told him the company was a new
one and very particular about its rules

  nothing would advance him so rapidly
in official favor he was told as strict ad-
herence to and enforcement of all rules
billy was unusually proud of his conduc-
tors badge and when he stepped on his
first train at the cincinnati depot he felt
that he owned considerable stock in the c
h and d

    as he approached glendale he ran into
his first obstruction this was a corpulent
individual seated modestly in the rear end
of a car without pass or ticket echart told
him the rules were very strict and that the
conductor had no alternative

     how long have-you been on the road
have you a card sir  asked the passenger

    yes billy had a fresh bunch of
cards just printed he gave the fat man
one adding that this was his last trip

  ah i thought as much well sir
m- name is wood i am tjhe general super-
intendent of this road sometimes i carry
a pass but left it to-day in another coat at
my office

     sorry indeed sir but there are so
many with the best of excuses who are put
off the company assures me that every
one entitled to a pass will have one with
him excuses will not balance my account
i do now know you sir and have no right
to know you without your pass

     young man you are right i am only


the railroad mans magazine

going to hamilton twenty miles the
agent there is my brother when we get in
well go together and see him here is my
fare

  echart took the fare with a trembling
hand with a vague idea that he had gained
a victory though what sort of a one he did
not know

  now everybody in hamilton knew old
yank wood six feet five in his stockings
weighing three hundred pounds with a
nasal twang that could be heard for miles

   he was the agent when they got to
hamilton yank was on the platform talk-
ing to ferd jones the ticket agent

  billys passenger stuck to him and as
soon as he got out yank and jones rushed
up to him with friendly greeting another
moment and billy was formally introduced
to the general superintendent

  from that time on echart rose rapidly
in the estimation of the company and was
gradually promoted to a high position lin-
coln for like fidelity to rules and regula-
tions was appointed superintendent of a
branch line

  this was at a time when railway men
looked upon superintendents as a species of
deity to be worshiped and feared and
echarts adventure was considered remark-
able in its way

good for life

t was running on the old cincinnati
and indianapolis road when i came
across a queer customer-a tall awkward
hoosier who got on at lawrenceburg with
a heavy valise i had not been on the road
very long and as hoosiers were something
of a novelty  watched my passenger with
more than usual interest

    he took his valise to a double seat and
sitting down in one emptied the valise in
the other there were yellow-covered nov-
els enough on that seat to have starred an
indiana bookstore

   he found room somewhere for his feet
and taking up one of the books was fixed
for the trip when i called for tickets he
showed me a life-pass from the general su-
perintendent written in the form of a letter
and of course i thought my passenger was
a man of some consequence all railway
superintendents in those days wrote illegi-
ble hands they seemed to look upon such an

accomplishment as an evidence of genius
but the general superintendent of that road
beat them all

   when i came out of indianapolis on
the return trip my hoosier friend was on
the train in a double seat books and all so
it was for ten or a dozen trips he was the
first to board the train and the last man to
leave one day i said to him

    stranger which way 

    any way he replied without taking
his eyes off tfie book any way hang the
odds 

    i mean which way are you traveling-
aint you in the wrong train 

     indianapolis road isnt it 

     yes i answered

     wal thats my road drive on

   being a constant customer i got ac-
quainted with him this was his expla-
nation 

    you see this road runs through the
old mans farm down there near lawrence-
burg when the fellers was buildin on it
the old man he fit em he sued em and
the general super sent him a family pass
for life and im a-ridin it out

    i couldnt get it through me at all and
when we got to cincinnati i persuaded
him to accompany me to headquarters
when i assured him the general superin-
tendent would do the fair thing an ex-
pert there translated his life-pass which
read as follows

   j van- buskirk lawrenceburg

     dont disturb the men as you value your
   life let them pass through come or send
   one of your family to this office and the
   matter will be satisfactorily arranged
   conductors will recognize this as a pass

gekl supt

   as nobody could read but a word here
and there of this scrawl the fellow would
have been riding to this day if i had not
brought about that translation

  many funny scenes occur in a linnel
only you can see nothing at all for the dark-
ness at the same time i am satisfied that
such scenes do occur once a gentleman
for some unexplained reason undertook to
change the lower portion of his apparel dur-
ing those dark seconds but made a wrong
calculation as to time

    but kissing seems to be the choice sport
kissing in a tunnel think of that i have
been told that the charm is in the novelty of
the thing it is the darkness the rank bur-
vanishing railroaders



glary the nice calculation as to time the
sudden assault and desperate defense the
acute agony of the skirmish-line hairpins
the carrying of the outer works the fierce
struggle the sweetness of the surrender the
questionable honor of the victory

   then the horrid repairs and the im-
possible attempt to appear serene before the
other passengers theres a short lifetime
in the kissing of a girl in a tunnel

   i had a newly married couple out with
me on the cincinnati express i have had
a great many just such couples in my time
but somehow or other these youngsters at-
tracted my attention

  young man curly hair of course
young lady blonde you know with that
sort of hair that when you and i were young
used to be called tow rosy cheeks full
lips well i should say a very sweet girl

   he was awful  gone on her and she-
well i thought i could hear her saying
james be still everybodys looking at
you

  we were coming to the cavernous grove
and james became fidgety it was plain
that there was a conspiracy and that the
tunnel was tp be made a party to it

   the girl was thoughtful and evidently
unconscious then the wheels rattled and
whirred louder and louder in another
second we were in the tunnel-james his
bride and all of us

  we came through all right james
was through too-but the bride not quite
the wreck was fearful there was very
little of jamess hair left on his head
the color had faded from one of her
cheeks and lodged on his nose his neck-
tie was swinging from her brooch

   she commenced the work of reconstruc-
tion looking up at him under her uplifted
arms as if to say  see what you have
done before these people

  james went for a drink of water i
saw him with one hand on the nozzle of
the cooler and the other on a flask half
the hairpins were gone and when she sat
up straight looking so wo begone and
friendless i was rude enough to smile i
couldnt help it she saw it and smiled
in return as if to say  you know how it
is yourself

  sandy burrell of the i b w and r
road was the next

   i had a baggage-smasher running with
me once he said  who had his old-fash-
ioned idea of running baggage exploded in

a peculiar way jim had ruined two or
three trunks for a certain commercial trav-
eler whose route lay along our line and
who resolved to teach him a lesson

  this gentleman who was in the hard-
ware line packed a carpet - bag full of
loaded revolvers and handed it to jim
who took it and as the owner went away
threw it against the wall of the car sav-
agely then drew it on the floor and
stamped on it as usual

    at about the fourth jump firing began
forty-two revolvers went off in rapid suc-
cession distributing bullets around the car
with disgusting carelessness the smashers
legs running against six of them before he
could get out of the car

   he rode upon the platform during the
whole of that trip and when he did enter
the car he encased his legs in stove-pipe
and ran an iron-clad snow-plow in front
of him to push the baggage out he is
running on our main line now and i be-
lieve he smashes fewer carpet-bags than he
did in the blissful past-much fewer-and
he wears a melancholy air

  a freight - train with a passenger ca-
boose attached is called on some lines an
 accommodation it  accommodates  the
company rather than the public and derives
its chief recommendation from the fact that
it stops at all stations this particular
train has been sidetracked for the night we
find a number of the boys gathered in its
caboose

   as i was going through the car on my
run to-day said sayre the con  i saw
a lady smoking a pipe very industriously
in the rear seat

    madam said i as courteously as i
knew how  we dont even allow men to
smoke in this car

    that is an excellent rule sir she
replied with the utmost coolness  if i see
any man smoking in here ill inform you
at once

  last fall said sayre tom holds-
worth had an extra stock east on the main
line he stopped on the grade and len
bassett a brakeman went back to flag
in starting up the train broke in two
bassett seeing that he could not stop the
train that was following and gaining
rapidly upon them rushed for his own
train woke up his drovers and jumped
them out saving a number of lives he
then put on brakes and stopped his train
the result being but a slight damage to the


the railroad mans magazine

way-car this was an exhibition of nerve
that you dont see every day

   oh i dont know as it beats lucas
much said lowry  brakeman charlie
lucas saw a headlight one night coming
pretty close he took his torpedoes and red
light and went back arriving at the
proper distance he found he was flagging
a belated fanner who was hunting up stray
stock there were no signs of any other
pursuing train charlies name has since
been changed from lucas to looseness
though he never gets tight

   do you know how near bill power
came to getting his foot in it   asked
 pigeon

   didnt think there was anything big
enougli to hold it 

   yes about ten years ago he applied to
hammond for a passenger-train

  all right sir replied the colonel
 only one objection

     whats that   asked power

    require an extra coach to carry your
feet

   doc merriman says he was coming
down grade once to side - track for some
train when he saw obstructions on the
track ahead there were two or three
inches of snow on the track which made
them more visible of course

   he reversed called for brakes and
sent his fireman down to clear the way
fireman returned and said there was
nothing there  doc  swore and went
himself after surveying the obstacles a
moment he looked over to the switch and
there stood patch

     patch yelled  doc  the next time
you cross the track in front of my engine
i want you to pick up your tracks there
aint an engine on the road can git over
em in three inches of snow 

   i think i can couple on to that said
richardson and get ahead sam young
who was well known in truckee nevada
is conductor on a freight running to visa-
lia on the southern pacific road one
night when the moon was full his train
was steaming over the broad plain near
visalia iust as the orb of night was rising

   the moon appeared like a locomotive
headlight in front of the train apparently
at considerable distance ahead the in-
stant he saw the light sam yelled to the
engineer to stop the train

  the alarm was given the brakes
whistled down in a jiffy and the train

stopped the conductor jumped off and
ran on ahead a few hundred yards as rap-
idly as possible on the track and com-
menced swinging-his red lantern as a sig-
nal of danger to the supposed approaching
train

   after worrying himself out in running
and swinging liis light he stopped a mo-
ment completely out of breath and took a
square look at the fancied monster in front
sam young saw  the man in the moon
and the truth flashed upon him that he
was awfully bilked

   he hastened back to his train and
told the engineer to go ahead as the dan-
ger of a collision was more remote than he
had calculated the engineer fireman
and brakeman discovered the mistake be-
fore the conductor did sam promised to
stand treat for the next six months if the
parties who witnessed the blunder would
agree not to make it public but the joke
was too broad and too good to keep and
in spite of the promises made it leaked
out

   cook of the p p and j went into
chicago and paid a visit to the dollar
store after making some trifling pur-
chases he offered the pretty saleswoman a
dollar for a kiss the lady agreed and
delivered the goods

  now says she with a pretty foreign
accent  give me another dollar and you
may kiss my mother cook was delighted
with the adventure and paid over the dol-
lar the girl went out and returned lead-
ing in a wrinkled old blear-eyed female
hobbling on crutches

  here she is 

    not any if you please miss the
fact is i never mix drinks i am a freight
conductor on the p p and j send her
to the depot and ill bill her through at
special rates  

    dutch  cooper was coming west on

	and wanted to stop in the hollow near
wyanet for water frank avery the
brakeman proposed to give him a lightning
stop right there all by himself

   it was a down grade and coming from
princeton to wyanet frank fell asleep and
failed to get out the consequence was
they ran by the tub clear into wyanet
and cooper was just screaming for brakes
he was mad and backed up to the tub
swearing like a streak

  in the meantime frank was scratch-
ing his head and studying how he was to
vanishing railroaders



get out of the scrape while cooper was
taking water avery walked over on the
engine and said

    cooper i like to broke my leg back
there

     how is that  asked  dutch

    well i got out on top and tried to
set the brake but the demed dog broke
and threw me off it nearly killed me

     is that so well i was pretty mad
you broke your leg yes i feel better
now 

  we had a smash-up down near du
quoin onthe illinois central once said
old pop davidson the veteran eagle-eye
 i dont know how much stock was killed
but the next day the supe got the following
letter

    i want you to cum yer at oncet theres
bin a smashup i want you to bring six
dollars to pay for mi hog the hog
squeeled but the engine wouldnt stop
j cerample 

  then dick hammond an old chicago
railroader brought the arabian nights to
a close with this one

   about the only thing a conductor fears
is the dense fog i remember the day we
were caught in one and if you will let
me spit it out in my own way maybe you
can understand

    hank says i to the brakeman  you
go over and tell smith-our engineer-to
keep a wild-eye second extra on no 
left leland about five minutes ago look
back pretty often see if theyre coming
tell smith to side-track at sandwich and
let no  by

    tell him to get in out of the way
quicker than lightning for no  will be
whooping em up by the time she strikes
the whistling-post i dont want to drop
any torpedo on her to-night si honner
was at the throttle and his engine no
 had just come out of the shops and
he wanted to make a record with her

to be

     hank says  all right and rushes up
  the ladder and over onto the engine fog
  no i guess not

    on arriving at the switch smith
 whistles down brakes i calls out from
 the way-car and asks

       whats the matter  

     hank says  extra ahead on one side-
  track engine disabled on the other

    about that time i could hear no 
  coming over the iron bridge about a mile
  away i picked up the red light and ran
  back with the flag i ran as far as i
  dared slapped down two torpedoes ran
  a little farther and could just see no s
  headlight

    it seemed about forty feet in the air
  could almost feel her hot breath as she
  came tearing along anxious to make up
  every lost minute

     si honner was behind her anxious for
  the reputation of his better half as he
  styled his engine

     he was peering through the fog when
  he saw the red flag waved across the track
  he whistled down brakes and without
  waiting to shut her off hauled her over

    the rail being wet she slipped and
  as he struck the torpedoes he slipped out
  between tender and engine and took a
  look at things

     about that time his headlight shone
  on the hind end of a way-car you could
  have jumped from the pilot to the back
  platform without much exertion for a
  minute si looked like animated rigor mortis

    a miss is as good as a mileand si
  felt greatly relieved when he discovered
  that the only damage done was the wet-
  ting of the  all over with that peculiar
  mixture of coal-dust and water for which
  the boys have an appropriate name be-
  lieve me i dont like those fogs when i
  look back through all these years and
  think how near  came to hitting us-
  it makes me wince

brain teasers

here is a nifty nut to crack it is from f t montgomery king
city california

    	three trains of different lengths and speed were traveling
on adjacent tracks at a certain time the tail-lights of all three trains
were abreast ten seconds later during which time train no  traveled
her length the headlights were abreast and in another ten seconds the
headlight of no  the longest and tail-lights of no  were abreast
and the headlight of no  and tail-lights of no  the shortest were
abreast at what speed was no  traveling assuming all speeds constant
and that of no  to be  miles an hour

    from p m monckton powell river british columbia we have
received the following juicy pippin go to it boys

    	two cities boomville and hustle city are connected by two
competing railroads a train on each line leaves boomville at noon and
reaches hustle city by the b line in two-thirds of the time taken by the
a line since the latters train runs only half as fast as the formers on
the return journey again both companies start a train from hustle city
at the same hour but this time the train on the a line runs twice as fast
as that on the b the result is that a beats b by  hours also the speed
run by a in the second case is the same as that run by b in the first case
what is the distance between the two cities by each route

    one more good one by fritz gannon fort collins colorado

  a conductor on a fast run being asked at what speed the
train was traveling replied  for the twenty-fourth time since midnight
the hour and minute hands of my watch are at right angles to one another
and when they are next opposite the train will have traveled  miles
farther

    at what speed per hour was the train traveling and what was the
time of day when the conductor made the remark

     answers to april teasers

    	sixty-three empties picked up  loads

    	at  ten-elevenths pm no  is  two-elevenths miles
cast of b and no  is  eight-elevenths miles west of b therefore
the trains are  ten-elevenths miles apart

  and there are others

  among the special articles we will publish the
life story of george stephenson whose name will
live as long as steam is applied to motion june
is the one hundred and thirtieth anniversary of
stephensons birth and no doubt there are many
who do not know the terrible obstacles against
which he had to fight before gaining the slightest
recognition if you do know his story it will be
worth reading again

describe the inner workings of the claim office

  aside from these more practical features there
will be the usual quota of articles dealing with
the funny side of railroading such as  tales in
the roundhouse  ten thousand miles by
rail and  queer things on the line all new
and fresh and just the sort of stuff that one wants
to read when the days work is over anti he needs
a few hours of recreation before hitting the hay

  we have the    order for june all aboard

what do you think

according to the prominent technical jour-
nals of the country there is a strong move-
ment on foot to abolish the time-honored  johnson
bar in favor of some more easily controlled
apparatus-one which will permit of more refine-
ment in the adjustment of the valve-gear from
the birth of the locomotive in this country as
we all know the reverse has been effected through
the reverse-lever working in a notched quadrant
and requiring purely manual effort for its manipu-
lation

  for many years at least half a ccntury during
which period there was practically no development
in the size and weight of the american locomotive
this appliance effectually served the purpose for
which intended the weight of the various parts
making up the valve-gear links eccentric-straps
rods rockers and valves was light and no diffi-
culty was experienced in pulling the lever over
when unlatched even with the locomotive at the
highest speed the engineer was not at all alarmed
that it would get away from him and consequent-
ly it was used as it was expected that it would
be to adjust the cut-off to meet the requirements
of load and grade

  in s or thereabouts began the revolution
which has taken place in locomotives previous
to that time the heaviest freight-enginc weighed
scarcely  pounds but with the advent of
the compound system this weight increased to




the railroad mans magazine

 pounds cast steel began to take the
place of cast iron for frames driving-boxes rock-
ers and wheel centers and in a very few years
say about  a locomotive was not considered
worthy of special comment regarding size unless
it tipped the scales at  pounds

  this advance in general weight implied of
course a proportionate advance in the weight of
the component parts eccentric-straps links etc
parts of the valvc-gear which must be lifted by the
reverse-lever became doubly heavy no matter
what counterbalancing features were resorted to
in order that the movement of the lever might be
assisted it became realized in a vague sort of
way that it would no longer fill the bill

  the engineers especially on heavy locomotives
at the head of high-speed trains became rather
afraid of their old friend many of them learned
rather unpleasantly that it had better be let alone
when once hooked up into the running-notch
often when they would attempt to make a nicer
adjustment pull her up or drop her down a notch
the lever would have an awkward knack of twist-
ing out of their hands and whipping down into
the corner with a bang occasionally to the ac-
companiment of a shower of notches pulled out
of the quadrant and maybe a broken eccentric-
strap so gradually the situation resolved into
one notch for the lever and it was let severely
alone thereby defeating the adjustable feature of
all valve-gears

  after the gradual appreciation of this fact
motive-power management was impelled to look
across the sea for a solution to the problem there
they use the screw reverse-gear in which the links
are raised and lowered by means of a hand wheel
operating a threaded screw connected to the
reach-rod and which unquestionably operates
with the minimum of effort at whatever speed the
locomotive may be working it appears to be
more and more apparent every day that this ar-
rangement must be incorporated in american
practise

  screw-reversing mechanism takes up little room
in the cab it can be wound to full reverse with
three turns of the wheel by one hand whether
steam is being used or not and it permits of the
very finest adjustment of the gear to meet the
varying conditions which are at all times arising

  it is enthusiastically indorsed bv the foreign
roads on which it is used the engineers are loud
in their praise the only possible objection which
might be urged would be slow movements in
switching but it is not intended to advocate its
use for switch-engines

  what is specifically desired is a valve-gear con-
trolling mechanism which can be operated on
high-speed locomotives without danger to the en-
gineer in which he will have sufficient confidence
to attempt to work as we have said the present
reverse-lever largely defeats the purpose of valve-
gears whether shifting-link or radial because
if it must be said many engineers fear it the
screw-gear offers an easy solution to this we

would be glad if some enterprising motive-power
chief would give it a fair trial

let the headlight alone

we have noticed that the tendency exists on
some roads to transfer the headlight from
its well - known position above the smoke - box
in front of the stack to the front of the smoke-
box door we do not enthuse greatly over the
change in some cases it is necessary with new
and larger locomotives to preserve the proper
overhead clearance in the face of such conditions
no objection can be urged but we have particu-
larly in mind instances where headlights are be-
ing relocated on old engines where an abundance
of clearance always existed

  in explanation it is said that lowering the head-
light about to the center line of the engine serves
to illuminate the track to better advantage but
when it is remembered that the oil-iamp is prac-
tically valueless to the engineer as an illuminating
agent the argument does not seem logical all
it amounts to at the best is to give warning that
the engine is approaching

  in its old position the headlight is protected
it is so high up that it cannot be struck by an
object and arranged on a board supported by
columns there is a free circulation of air between
it and the hot smoke-box at all times thoroughly
protecting it from burning

  as it is now after relocation it seems almost
inconceivable how it can be protected either from
fire or damage the smoke-box door is opened
every trip for netting examination and other well
known routine roundhouse features and it will
take considerable care to work a wrench on the
door button-nuts without doing some harm to the
headlight the fact should also be recalled that
all doors are not in perfect condition many of
them are cracked and it is no unusual sjght to see
a red-hot door resulting from a fire in the smoke-
box-which of course would mean no headlight
in a very few miles

  on the whole we think that this is one of the
things which had better be let alone it can have
no other result than a positive increase in ex-
pense not to mention a sad blow to the sym-
metrical appearance of the locomotive if an
electric headlight were under consideration this
comment might not apply but the oil-light is far
better off in its present position in front of the
stack

the november railroad mans magazine
has just reached this far corner of uncle
sams possessions and i take pleasure in
congratulating you on the versatile make-up of
this number there is just enough of the techni-
cal in the stories to pique the interest of a lay-
man and like oliver twist ask  for more

  i have never been connected in any way with
railroads but in some twenty-three years service
in the army i have had the pleasure of riding
a few miles on them and somehow or other i
have always entertained a fellow feeling for rail-
road men the world over

   i assure you that the readers of the railroad

	vithick was the real inventor of the loco-
motive this worthy man was born in england
april   and died at the age of sixty-two
tie was an engineer and inventor and was called
 the father of the locomotive engine he
was the man who introduced the high-pressure
steam engine in  he effected improvements
in the plunger-pump an indispensable adjunct to
mining this was later developed by him into a
double-acting water-pressure engine in 
he ronstructed the first steam locomotive ever used
on a railway this engine was a marked advance
on all previous types and it is on the strength
of its performance that trevithick was hailed as

the  real inventor of the locomotive dont you
remember the verse in that stirring poem  the
engine-driver to his engine by william j
macquorn rankine which runs

  put forth your force my iron horse with
      limbs that never tire

heroes of the forest fires

editor the railroad mans magazine

in a recent number of a certain monthly i read
an article describing the devastation by fire
of the national forest reserves in montana
and idaho and also picturing deeds of bravery
and life saving in the hitter root mountains
i

	the railroad mans magazine

  this article is not at all exaggerated in the
description of the fire but when the author tells
of the  heroes  it made he is certainly over-
stepping the line

  i am not writing these lines in malice toward
those would-be heroes for they are more to be
pitied than scorned i am simply going to give
to the world the truth through the railroad
mans magazine of what actually occurred during
the fire in the bitter root mountains further-
more the names of the men who honestly deserve
credit

  on the night of august   word reached
avery idaho that the little town of grand forks
twelve miles east was burning also the c m
and p s depot at falcon close by there were
several hundred men women and children gather-
ed on the platform of the burning depot when en-
gineer johnnie mackedon returning from the lop
of the mountain with his helper engine was stop-
ped by the frantic people

  they climbed on his engine and hung on where-
ever they could get a grip

  the cars on the side-track were burning yet
mackedon switched an empty from them and left
falcon with a load of human freight each per-
son was clinging to some little keepsake from his
burning home mackedon carried those people
to safety

  conductor vandercook and engineer blondell
also deserve credit for their bravery

  to these two men a well-known official of
the c m and p s railroad owes his life this
official in his zeal to get all the people out of
falcon was left behind himself when conductor
vandercook missed hiui from the many who
sought refuge in one of the tunnels he and en-
gineer blondell decided to go back down the moun-
tain for him the huge timbers of the bridges
were burning beneath them but still they kept
on until they had rescued the official from certain
death

  their return trip up the mountain to the tunnel
was terrible the bridges were all ablaze after
crossing them they were compelled to stop and
extinguish the flames that threatened to demolish
their caboose

  they remained in the tunnel eight days until
the bridges were rebuilt

  where were the government officials all this
time they had beat it to safety

  when engineer blondell was asked about his
experience he replied

   why all that you could see of a bridge was
a wall of flame-but we crossed it i hooked
her up threw her wide open and then we lay
down on the deck to protect ourselves from the
heat we expected that every minute would be
our last on earth

  those are the men who deserve credit for life-
saving on the c m and p s railroad in idaho
and montana

  the women and children were taken to teoka
washington where they were taken care of by the
good people of that town

  ralph w anderson the roundhouse foreman
deserves the credit of saving the town of avery

longing to the c m and p s railroad

  one of the forest rangers was asked about
 back firing  to save the town he replied that
he would give orders to shoot the first man that

set a back fire but he was too timid to stay and
see that his orders were carried out

  air anderson summoned all of the japanese
employed at the roundhouse and with johnnie
mackedon who had returned to avery charles
swanson engine despatcher mr delmire the
operator at avery and tom huff blacksmith
helper they started under andersons orders to
back fire on both sides of the st joe river
they soon had the fire eating its way up the
mountainsides and avery was saved these are
the heroes who deserve the credit for saving life
and property in the bitter root mountain fires

an old order

editor the railroad mans magazine 

although i am not a subscriber i never
miss a copy of your magazine as i am
interested in railroading my father was
an engineer on the old colony railroad in the
states a number of years ago also engineer on
the union freight railroad in s his name
was john h jennings i grieve to say that he
was called to the home beyond a few months ago
but i would deem it an honor to hear from any
one who knew him

i treasure carefully an order he received while
on the u f r r of which i enclose a copy

              union freight railroad

            s c putnam general freight agent
a h grovenor agent

       office no  old state house

boston june  

  to the conductors and engineers of the union
freight railroad

  it is ordered that in all cases before crossing
a horse railroad track the engine will come to
a full stop at least thirty feet distant from the
crossing the conductors will see that the flag-
man is on the crossing ahead of the engine and
the engineer will not start his engine until he
receives a signal from the flagman that the way
is clear and iree from danger

  i trust that i have not taken up too much of
your valuable space if any one who knew my
father sees this and wishes to write my address isr

 requests for the following  song of the k c
  what is the matter with the mail   the song

the midnight train

     across the dull and brooding night
     a giant flies with demon light

     and breath of wreathing smoke
     around him whirls the reeling plain

     and with a dash of dim disdain

he cleaves the sundered rock

     in lonely swamps the low wind stirs
     the belt of black funereal firs

     that murmur to the sky

      till startled by his mad career

they seem to keep a hush of fear

     as if a god swept by

     through many a dark wild heart of heath
     oer booming bridges where beneath
     a mighty river brawls

     by ruin remnants of the past

their lives trembling in the blast

     by singing waterfalls

     the slumbrer on his silent bed
     turns to the light his lonely head
     divested of its dream

     long leagues of gloom are hurried oer
     through tunnel sheaths with iron roar
     and shrill night rending scream

     past huddling huts past flying farms
     high furnace flames whose crimson arms
     are grappling with the night

     he tears along receding lands

     to where the kingly city stands

     wrapt in a robe of light

     here round each wide and gushing gate

     a crowd of eager faces wait

     and every smile is known

we thank thee o thou titan train

     that in the city once again

     we clasp our loved our own

only the brakeman

 vnly the brakeman killed say was that
          what they said

     the brakeman was our joe so then-our
          joe is dead

 dead dead dead but i cannot think its
    so

 it was some other brakeman-it cannot be our
     joe	

 why only	this last evening i saw	him riding
     past 

 the trains	dont stop here often-go	rushing by
     as fast

as lightning-but joe saw me and waved his
hand he sat
on the very last coal-car-how do you count for
that-

that he was killed alone and the others saved
    when he

was last inside the tunnel come now it couldnt

      be

its some mistake of course twas the fireman
     youll find

the engine struck the rock and he was just be-
     hind-

and the roof fell down on him-not on joe our
    joe i saw

that train myself the engine had work enough
    to draw

the coal-cars full of coal that rattled square and
     black

by tens and twenties past our door along that
    narrow track

on into the dark mountains i never see those
    peaks

thout hating them for much they care whether
the water leaks
down their sides to wet the stones that arch the
tunnels there
so long so black-they all may go and much the
mountains care

im sorry for that fireman whats that i dont
    pretend

to more than this i saw that train and joe
    was at the end

the very end i tell you  come dont stand here
     and mock-

what it was therei right at this end the tunnel
    caved-the rock

fell on him but i dont believe a word-yes
    thats his chain

and thats his poor old silver watch he bought
it-whats this stain
all over it why its red oh joe my boy
oh joe

then it was you and you are dead down in that
    tunnel go

and bring my boy back he was all the son i
had the girls
are very well but not like joe such pretty
golden curls

joe had until i cut them off at four years old he
     ran

to meet me always at the gate my bonnie little
    man

you dont remember him but then youve only
seen him when
he rides by on the coal-trains among the other
men

all of them black and grimed with coal and cir-
     cles round their eyes

whizzing along by day and night but you would
    feel surprise

to see how fair he is when clean on sundays
    and i know

youd think him handsome then ill have-god 

    i forget oh joe

my boy my boy and you are dead so young
but twenty-dead
down in that awful tunnel with the mountain
overhead


the railroad mans magazine

theyre bringing him oh yes i know theyll
bring him and whats more
theyll do it free the company theyll leave
him at my door
just as he is all grimed and black jane put
the irons on

and wash his shirt his sunday shirt its white

    he did have one
white shirt for best and proud he wore it sunday
with a tie

of blue a new one oh my boy how could they
    let you die for oh-

only the brakeman and his wage was small

    the engineer
must first be seen to there in front my god it
stands as clear
before my eyes as though id seen it all-the dark
-the crash-

the hissing steam-the wet stone sides-the arch
    above-the flash

of lanterns coming-and my boy my poor boy
    lying there

dying alone under the rocks only his golden
    hair

to tell that it was joe-a mass all grimed that
    doesnt stir

but motherll know you dear twill make no
    difference to her

how black with coal-dust you may be your poor
hard-working hands
all torn and crushed perhaps yes yes but no
one understands
that even though hes better off poor lad where
he has gone

 and the girls are left behind to stand it and
    live on

as best we can without him what a wreath
    a lady sent

some flowers was passing through and heard-
felt sorry-well twas meant
kindly no doubt but poor joed been the very
first to laugh
at white flowers round his blackened face youll
write his epitaph

whats that his name and age poor boy

    poor joe his name has done
its work in this life for his age he was not
twenty-one

well-grown but slender far too young for such a
place but then
he wanted to  help mother and to be among
the men	

for he was always trying to be old he carried
    wood

and built the fires for me before he hardly un-
    derstood

what a fire was-my little boy my darling baby
    joe-

theres something snapped within my breast i
    think it hurts me so

it must be something broken what is that i
    felt the floor

shake theres some one on die step go jeanie
    set the door

wide open for your brother joe is coming home
    they said

 only the brakeman -but it is my only son
    thats dead

 a railroad dream

  by mrs p d case

sitting in a rail-car flying on by steam
head against tlie casement dreamed a curi-
ous dream

vet i could not think it a thing all ideal

for though very monstrous it was very reap

first thgre came a gentleman in his patent
    leather-

collar bosom wrist-bands overcoat for weather
in the height of fashion watch-key hat and

     glove

and with air professional-spit upon the stove

xear him sat a parson telling how the lord
sent the great revivals blessed the preached
word

but my dream discovered that he was not above
honey-dew or fine-cut-spitting on the stove

xext came a trader-pockets full of cash-
talked about the country going all to smash

 war and abolition did the tiling by jove -
tipped his wicker bottle-spit upon the stove

then a jolly farmer bragging of his wheat
thought his hogs and horses nowhere could be
beat

 like to sell his durhams by the head or drove -
kept his jaws a wagging-spit upon the stove

paddy thought it was  quare like to be setting
    still

all the whole goin over bog and hill

twas a glorious country sure as he could prove-
equal to his betters-spitting on the stove

witness perfumed dandy putting on his air-
flourished diamond breastpin smoked in forward
car

talked about our army twas too slow by
    jove -

twirled a carrot mustache-spit upon the stove

little boy in short coat wants to be a man
following example as the surest plan

watches gent and parson-copies every move
and with pat and trader-spits upon the stove 

soon the flying rail-car reeks with nauseous steam
ladies almost fainting-children in a scream
husband asking lady  whats the matter love
have a glass of water  -spits upon the stove

on we go still flying-not a breath of air
fit for christian people in a crowded car
sickening fainting dying ladies make a move-
gent throws up the window-spits upon the stove

talk of ladies flounces ribbons jewels flowers
crinelin and perfume gossip idle hours

put all faults together which men cant approve
and they are not a match for-spitting on the
stove

men will call us  angels -wonder if they think
such nauseous vapor angel meat and drink
wonder if theyll do so when they get above
below it would be handier-spitting on the stove

watch insurance plan

     we bear the burden of
     changes in time service

   every railroad man in the country
will welcome our watch insurance
plan-for it means a saving of dollars
to you all

   from the time r r watch inspec-
tion was installed there has been a
drain on the purse of the r r man
because of the changes in require-
ments of the time service

  these changes have been neces-
sary to keep in step with the closer
running schedules of r r trains and
for the protection of life and property
-but unfortunately it lias been you
who paid the bill

  this hardship unavoidably im-
posed upon the r r men was brought
forcibly to us when investigating con-
ditions of the r r watch business

  and now when you buy a south
bend r r watch we insure you
against any further cost coming as a
result of any change in time service
within five years from the date of pur-
chase regardless of whether the new
requirements demand a higher priced
watch than the one you carry

tne studebaker passed by all chief inspectors

think of it

grasp the meaning of our great
watch insurance plan

   if you go from one road to another
-if the least change is made in the
requirement of r r watches-we
give you a new watch that will meet
the requirements on presentation of
our watch insurance certificate
which goes with every south bend
r r watch

   there are no strings to this watch
insurance plan-it is an unequivocal
guarantee to protect you against any
changes in the requirements of the
time service

  every new man in r r service-
every man now in service who must
buy a new standard r r watch-
should look ahead and provide for the
future the south bend is absolutely
the only watch which will protect you
against the cost of a nezv watch if the

the art of being certain

     the successful man doesnt guess-he knows because he takes the
trouble to find out

     when he is a bit  out of fix he says  something may be wrong
with my food

     then he proceeds to know by a ten days trial-leaving off greasy
meats pasty sticky and starchy half-cooked cereals white bread and pastry
and adopting a plain nourishing diet

      many men who really know use the following breakfast  some fruit
a saucer of grape-nuts and cream soft-boiled eggs some nice crisp toast
and a cup of postum-nothing more

  just hark back to some of those sultry
hot days of last summer when your under-
wear was sticky and uncomfortable then
you will be in a proper attitude to consider
the newest advance in underwear making-

dryskin

conductive underwear

 the dryskin fabric ac-
quires a fineness and linen-like-tex-
ture that is  more absorbent than
any other underwear in the market

 dryskin underwear is
more than merely porous-it is
conductive it does more than
merely absorb the moisture-it gets
rid of it and keeps the skin always
dry even in raging hot weather

 every pair of dryskin
drawers is equipped with the new
adjusta-slide which affords in-
stant adjustment of the waistband-
no draw-cords necessary

  enjoy the utmost of summer
comfort equip yourself with
dryskin underwear-youll
be cool and fresh during the hottest

days

 yet dryskin underwear
costs no more than the common-
place-c the garment and 
for union suits - in all forms
athletic half-sleeve regular etc
bovs sizes c single garment and
c union suits

  if your dealer doesnt carrv
dryskin underwear well

    mr frank a munsey new york

          dear sir

              i was a delegate to ihe presbyterian synod of missouri
     which met last november at fulton mo at this meeting
     dr re vis one of the secretaries of our foreign missionary
     board who had recently been sent lo africa to inspect our
     missions there made an address

          in this address he stated that he had visited one of the tribes
     far removed from the missionary station and from civilization
     the people were very ignorant concerning all the arts of civi-
     lization and had never seen but one specimen of printing this
     specimen was carefully cherished by the chief and on rare
     occasions he would bring it out and let his subjects get a glimpse

   of it it was a copy of munseys magazine 
   thought you might be interested in knowing what a wide circu-
   lation your publication had reached

yours truly

                    sanford sellers

we reprint this letter as a mat-
ter of interest-not because
there is any particular value to
circulation in the dark continent
but because it emphasizes a remark-
able phase of the munseys dis-
tribution

  one advertiser of neckwear in
the muxsey has just turned over to
us inquiries from china and ger-
many another an inquiry from
greece another from south aus-
tralia our records contain in-
stances of the muxsey s productive-
ness from virtually every habitable
country on the globe a financial
advertiser received a query from a
mountain fastness of india many
manufacturers have been enabled
to establish profitable selling agen-
cies through their foreign inquiries
from the muxsey

  all of which leads up to this de-
duction-a periodical of such world-
wide influence must be powerful

we inserted this one-inch advertisement in a recent issue
of munseys magazine it filled an inconspicuous place
on a page of small advertisements we charged our advertising
department with -just what the space would cost any
other advertiser

    thsre is nothing particularly clever about this announce-
ment it is a bare statement of our rates but doubtless its
plainness recommended it-for up to this date we have made
a profit of  on the business received from this insertion

    if we demanded any concrete demonstration of the pulling
power of space in munseys magazine this instance would
convince us

    certainly it is pretty conclusive evidence of the produc-
tiveness of space in the munsey magazines

fairy soap

          its whiteness suggests its purity - and appeals
       to them it floats always within easy reach - the
       youngster doesnt have to dive for it the shape of the
       cake is oval - it fits the hand to a nicety

       being made from edible products fairy soap agrees
       with even the tender skin of a babe and cleanses
       thoroughly without irritating

       try fairy soap in your nursery and learn why
       -though its price is but c - it possesses more
       soap virtues than any other soap at any
