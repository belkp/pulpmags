 f this medal won by one of the van camp chefs the parisian society of chefs gave this medal to one of the men now baking van camps it was won in two great contests and it marks this man as a recognized peer among the great chefs
of the world

 such men as this have created here the
 finest dish of baked beans ever tasted

there is nothing like it all the
ordinary sorts become commonplace be-
side it

 the white plump beans-picked out by
 hand-cost three times what some beans
 cost the tomato sauce costs five times
 what common sauce is sold for

 the baking is done in steam ovens so

 the beans are baked to mellowness with-
 out bursting or crisping a bean

  and the beans by our process come to
you with all the fresh oven flavor

  please try them dont assume that all
baked beans are similar see what talent
and time and modern methods offer you
in van camps

  if you can then go back to old-style
beans we have nothing more to say

   the perfect tone-the tone you like the
best-is different with different selections

    you will never be satisfied with any musical
instrument which does not respond to your
individual tastes and requirements how many
times have you been actually irritated by hear-
ing music played too loud too fast too slow
too low or in some way which did not answer
your desire at the moment

   the only way you can be sure of having
your music exactly the way you want it is to
own an instrument which you can control at all
times to suit your varying desires

    victor changeable needles enable you to exercise
this control to give any selection the exact tone you
wish and to make the instrument constantly adaptable
to your different moods and your varied demands for
musical entertainment in your home victor change-
able needles can thus be compared to the pedals of
the piano the stops of wind instruments or the
bowing of the violin

    contrast these advantages of the victor change-
able needle system with the old style fixed or un-
changeable point in other instruments where all
records must be played exactly alike and where there
is no possibility of changing the sound volume
or the tone quality

  because the victor
is always subject to
your complete con-
trol it gives you
more entertainment
more variety more
personal individual
satisfaction day in
and day out



 any victor dealer will gladly play any music you wish
 to hear and demonstrate the value of the changeable
 needle

chapter i

the morning exodus from hazel-
wood was past from the seven-
thirty-six to the nine-ten the
trains had been crowded with mascu-
line commuters according to their de-
gree first the young clerks and office
assistants the stenographers and the
bookkeepers next the plain business
men then the more leisurely profes-
sions and finally those aristocrats of
mercantile life the brokers and the
bankers

  hazelwood boasted a due proportion
of all classes it was no mushroom
suburb filled overnight with bare star-
ing new houses with signposts boldly
naming imaginary highways across
swamps and fields except upon its
outskirts the realty companys boards
beseeching travelers to own their own
homes had not been seen for a score
of years hazelwood felt itself almost
as firmly established in the permanent
order of things as if it had been perugia
or windsor

  not only had all the men of the com-
munity with the exception of the doc-
tors the clergymen or the local trades-
men made their way into the city but
the children above the age of five had
also deserted their homes in pursuit of
the education that hazelwood was held
to offer advantageously to the young
there were to begin at the beginning

the free kindergarten miss mains kin-
dergarten and the french kindergar-
ten the mothers of hazelwood could
to speak vulgarly pay their money and
take their choice and for every age
beyond the kindergarten there was the
same ample field of selection

  if one were engaged in small business
in the village itself or were employed
on a small salary in the city there was
the public school for ones children-a
violent red-brick structure standing in
an unfavored region known locally as
across the tracks if ones aspiring
social sense refused the offering of the
board of education there was miss
salters where ones girls and small
boys could obtain a pleasant sense of
exclusiveness at a very moderate fee
and for the offspring of the people who
occupied the houses on the heights
which looked like comfortable palaces
in miniature there was miss de yeres
where ones daughters might be either
finished as ornamentally or pre-
pared as thoroughly as possible ac-
cording as one was a conservative or a
progressive parent

  in brief hazelwood was a suburb
like hundreds of others and for its
well-to-do women except those who
were zealous devotees of bridge or of
country sports and those whose passion
was to lunch and shop and tea in town
the days went by in almost cloistral lack
of contact with the world


smiths magazine

  romola ventnor had lived in hazel-
wood twelve years before she was sud-
denly struck with the strange emptiness
of her days she had gone there as a
bride sometimes even now when her
heart was particularly tender she
walked past the house that had been the
first home of her married life

  it was not on the heights to which
richard had so soon insisted on attain-
ing but down in the center almost at
the very corner of main street it had
not been painted so romola believed
in the decade since she and richard
had left it business had crept closer
and closer to it and had finally seized
it a sign j mccarty and son pa-
per hanging kalsomining and interior
decorating was hung between the par-
lor windows but romola always had
a smile and a sigh for the old house
she told herself it was because the bos
ton ivy grew more luxuriantly there
over the piazza rails and pillars than
she had been able to induce it to grow
over the stone chimneys buttresses
and arches of the new place

  it was before the french window of
her room opening out upon her own
individual piazza that she was smitten
that april morning with a new curious
disturbing impression of the dullness of
her existence

  she had seen ralph her ten-year-old
son off for school on his bicycle she
had watched paul and lucy the seven-
year-old twins start proudly on foot
she had made a note of the things that
richard wished her to superintend that
day-little repairs in the house little
undertakings in the garden she had
felt his habitual cool kiss of farewell
dropped haphazardly somewhere on her
face and she had waved him her habit-
ual good-by from the library window as
he started for the nine-ten she had
seen mr weston next door invite
richard to ride to the station in the
motor car in which weston himself al-
ways performed the eight-minute trip
and she had smiled at richards gesture
of thanks and refusal

  her husband was very sure that he
walked to the station because he be-
lieved in the value of fresh air and ex-

ercise with a little faint affectionate
skepticism she wondered how long his
theory would survive the ownership of
an automobile a car had been as ut-
terly out of the question for them as a
steam yacht while they had been pay-
ing for this sumptuous and stately
dwelling of theirs but now that the
mortgage was finally lifted she won-
dered if her husband in spite of his
spartan doctrines would not begin to
desire what so many of their friends
and neighbors had richard had a
fashion of believing the best none too
good for his family

  after she had seen the last of his
descending figure she had devoted a
few minutes to her daughter rose aged
four and a half rose was a delightful
young person of the butter-ball-and-
strawberry variety-plump toppling lit-
tle figure dimples pink cheeks flying
golden hair sometimes romola im-
patiently wished that she dared to dis-
miss nurse dockerty who seemed to
regard rose as her own property and
who jealously resented any interference
in her rule but nurse dockerty had
been with romola since the first child
was born  she had established rights in
the family she was a ventnor institu-
tion the source of much envy in less
blessed households she was a tower
of strength in all emergencies when
richard had had typhoid when the
children had acquired one juvenile com-
plaint after another it had been nurse
dockerty who had kept existence
smooth and orderly who had seemed
with her old-fashioned sense and wis-
dom to be the doctors most efficient
ally to think of dismissing her was
impossible so romola submitted to
playing a somewhat unimportant
though sufficiently picturesque role in
her youngest childs upbringing

  tt had not taken long for her to plan
the simple menus for the day and to
apportion the work between her two
servants it had not taken long to tele
phone the plumber about the leak in the
third-story bathroom faucet and the
carpenter about the persistently creak-
ing board in the second-story back hall

  it was only half past ten when she
the awakening of romola



stood before the win-
dow of her room and
demanded of herself
what she should do
with her day it was
then that she had the
surprised realization
that the day before
her for all her pain
ful sense of its desue
tude was remarkably
like most of her days
lately

 romola was a con
scientious woman
and it was against
her creed to waste
time in repining if
she sometimes con
fused introspection
with dissatisfaction
and any subjective in
tellectual process
with useless discon-
tent why-she had
not been trained in
the fine points of
psychology she had
married w h e  she
was but twenty and
the years before that
age do little to de-
velop in ones mind
an appreciation of
philosophical subtle-
ties

 to-day finding
herself in a mood for
question for demand-
ing of the universe wherefore and
to what end she conscientiously
sought for a remedy for her state of
mind work the universal cure she de-
cided was what she needed she turned
from the window toward her room

 the room expressed the woman she
had grown to be it was spacious aus-
terely elegant fastidiously plain the
furniture was of one of the old eng-
lish designs almost classic in its sever-
ity  it was a gray enamel scarcely for-
bidding but surely not alluring to the
senses the silvery-grav walls showed
few adornments there was an etching
or two and a japanese print

  on the dressing table the toilet ap-
purtenances were those of a woman
scornful of adventitious aids to beauty
the silver-backed brushes and the sil-
ver-stoppered bottles were of the sever-
est pattern the lounge of gray enamel
and cane at the foot of the bed was
piled with blue pillows that looked as
if they were never pressed there was
no faintest touch of the sybarite in the
apartment looking at it to discover
some work to do romola unexpectedly
found it cold repellent

  its absolutely colorless she told
herself its enough to atrophy ones
emotions a room like this


smiths magazine

  she stared at it a little frown be-
tween her delicate brown eyebrows
she did not see how to do it over she
did not know what colors what designs
would make appeal to her in her new
state of mind

  its fundamentally wrong she pon-
dered one would have to begin at
the beginning to do anything with it-
with the paper and thats out of the
question we ought to have a breath-
ing space financially now that dick has
finished paying for the house

  labor in her own room being thus
barred she wandered about the house
searching for some work that would be
a sedative to her restlessness but the
mending basket in the nursery offered
her no scope for industry-it was one
of xurse dockertys most praiseworthy
habits that she never allowed the mend-
ing to accumulate

  the thought of spring housecleaning
tempted romola for a moment but
what a farce would spring houseclean-
ing be in a place like this still new
equipped with every device for saving
labor that the ingenuity of builders and
architects had yet devised and thor-
oughly cleaned each week with a vacu-
um cleaner she must find work not
manufacture it

  out-of-doors seemed a more hopeful
field of operations rudolph the ger-
man gardener and handy man whom the
yentnors shared with their neighbors
on either side according to the excel-
lent cooperative suburban habit was
burning a small heap of litter that had
covered the rosebushes during the win
ter the pleasant pungent smell of
smoke was on the warm spring air the
slender blue spiral curled lazily up-
ward in the prestons border she saw
crocuses pushing through

  but once out in the mild seductive
sunlight romolas impulse toward gar-
den work subsided there was not
much to do on their half acre rich-
ards ideas as to the possibilities of
suburban plots were extremely ortho-
dox  he hated places dotted with flower
beds and outcropping in sudden arbors
a few shrubs in clumps a perennial
flower border close to the house and a

good sweep of lawn-for this horticul-
tural scheme he stood firm romola
had acquiesced as she acquiesced in al-
most everything that richard favored-
not from inability to think for herself
but from the almost religious conviction
that it was a wifes duty to make her
husbands home life as frictionless as
possible

  this morning to be sure she played
idly for a moment with the rebellious
thought of a little plot of her own its
jumbled heterodoxy hidden out of sight
behind a trellis-a plot where she might
raise pansies and parsley mignonette
and stocks but something told her
that not even this occupation would
soothe her dissatisfied restlessness

  she and rudolph exchanged a few
remarks on the rosebushes need of
fresh fertilizer and then she wandered
down the slope of the lawn to the ad-
mirably constructed stone wall that di-
vided the ventnor property from the
road the street-upland avenue was
the name it wore on neat signs at the
street corners-lay along the top of the
ridge hazelwood lying below it was
that morning delicately veiled in young
spring green  a mile below in the val-
ley the river glimmered silver and be-
yond it wooded banks rose to another
crest like that upon which the hazel-
wood aristocracy dwelt but the oppo-
site bank of the river had not yet in-
spired the genius of the suburban real-
estate developer it was the shimmering
green of woods that clothed the other
bank shot through with the red of un
folding maples and cascaded here and
there by a foam of white dogwood

  romola stood her hazel eyes fixed
on the spring beauty unrest surged
higher and higher in her it seemed to
her that some imprisoned spirit within
her was striving to break through the
dense covering that years of habit had
laid over impulse as the dogwood seed
must once have struggled to burst the
prisoning soil above them what was
it that had gone out of life that she
missed so poignantly what struggled
for expression for birth in her heart
what recollections what desires were
these that spring aroused in her
the awakening of cromola



  cantering down the road from one of
the houses beyond came evangeline
dimock the sound of her horses
hoofs drew romolas eyes from the
misty glamorous beauty of the bank
across the river and her thoughts from
the disquiet within her she waved a
greeting to her friend who slowed up
before her

  i wish you kept a horse romola
remarked evangeline after they had
exchanged preliminary remarks it
would be twice as much fun to ride with
you as to ride alone

  you neednt lack for companions
answered romola it seems to me
that half the women in hazelwood are
riding this season

  one likes a little congeniality even
in a horseback companion evangeline
grumbled it would do you good any-
way you dont take enough exercise
romola smiled teasingly at the rider
cant afford it she said even if
i am losing my looks no one ever tells
you you should take more exercise until
youre shapeless

  shapeless evangeline threatened
already at twenty-eight with portliness
looked with comic despair at the tall
slim figure standing below her youre
one of those fortunate creatures who
will never be that and as for afford-
ing it-who but rou stops to consider
the sordid question all hazelwood is
living beyond its means heaven knows
i couldnt afford a riding horse if flor-
ence and harry didnt give me free
board and lodgings but i know your
kind-youre one of the truly refined
who would consider it vulgar to be in
debt

  it isnt altogether my own view-that
prevails romola reminded her friend
you see theres richard with the
most puritanical notions about money
of course he did build this place be-
fore he had the money to pay for it
but that was because he was able to

see it was really saving money-

  i see-why pay rent-that sort
of thing well i wish hed let you have
a horse tell him it would save doc-
tors bills in the long run im not
motor mad myself but i must say that

some means of conveyance beyond ones
two feet is a comfort

  bwt not a necessity when one lives
less than ten minutes from the market
and the railroad station answered
romola im not very athletic you
know and i really think a horse would
be wasted on me as for a motor
much good it would do me with dick
away all day long

  youd have to have a chauffeur of
course nodded evangeline florence
is bothering harry to death to get her
a little runabout she can operate her-
self he so often goes in to town in the
car that she gets no use at all of it
romola-she glanced downward with
a worried expression on her round
high-colored frank face-im worried
about them have you noticed any-
thing

  noticed anything romola echoed
the words blankly she looked at evan-
geline bewilderedly

  yes about harry

  no i havent seen him very often
lately and i never notice anything
about people you know she hurried
on pleadingly as if she begged to be
spared any painful recital im af-
flicted with a sort of social astigmatism
i never see things and id so much
rather not be told anything that the
people wouldnt want me to know you
understand her flushed cheeks and
limpid eyes seemed to entreat evan-
gelines pardon for rebuffing her at-
tempt at confidence

  oh i know you think gossip is as
vulgar as debt laughed the girl on
horseback bitterly but it seems to
me that this is a little different natu-
rally i wouldnt want to spread gossip
about my own sister and her husband
but  am worried and youre the only
woman in hazelwood i would dream of
speaking to on the subject however
since you dont want to be bothered

with other peoples affairs- she

jerked her gauntlet higher on her wrist
and seemed about to start

  oh evangeline romola put lip
a protesting hand i know im self-
ish i dont mean to be but i am
please tell me anything you want


smiths magazine

  an automobile dashed by and some
one waved a hand and called a greeting
to the two women

  thats harry now just starting
for town and its eleven he was
playing cards at the keiths until after
three this morning 

  so thats it romola mused

  thats only part of it said evan-
geline succinctly mrs keith is the
whole of it-and  florence is such a
goose that she doesnt see it

  romolas only answer was a pained
oh r

 theyve been married twelve
years pursued evangeline and i
dont suppose that for the last nine that
foolish sister of mine has ever thought
of harry as a man-just a man hes
been of the species husband to her
she takes him for granted-she has
taken him for granted ever since the
honeymoon i suppose she thinks she
knows him-so she does of course
after a fashion she knows he doesnt
take cream in his coffee and that he
cant be broken of throwing ashes on
the floor and that he wont eat mush-
rooms

  but theres more to harry than
that hes only thirty-five-they were
married absurdly young-and he still
has impulses and emotions and appe-
tites too t dare say that have nothing
to do with the deadly matrimonial rut
in which they are living or were
things have changed since that keith
woman showed harry that she knew
he was something more than one of the
masculine providers of hazelwood

  now what shall i do florence is
as blind to the keith episode as she has
been to all harrys possibilities in the
past shall t try to open her eyes
probably stir up a horrid row make
harry hate me and have to leave their
house in consequence or what shall i
do  some one ought to do something
some one ought to tell florence
iraham that a man remains an indi-
vidual even if he is married some one
ought to tell her that marriage doesnt
convert human beings into mere do-
mestic machines  wish youd do it
shed pay some attention to you she

thinks you nearly perfect-ideal wife
and mother and all that dont say no
im coining in this afternoon to hear
what you think-dolly wont stand an-
other second

  she was off and blown to her on the
april breeze was romolas gasping
but i think ive always believed that
marriage did convert an individual into
a domestic machine

  a turn in the road hid dolly and
dollys rider from her she caught a
last glimpse of the large well-knit erect
figure in its dark riding habit of the
three-cornered black hat fastened firm-
ly upon the dark-red braids and she
went into the house with a strange dis-
turbing doctrine ringing in her ears

  marriage not convert human beings
into domestic machines but of course
it did-it did wife-mother-house-
mistress-was it possible that there was
more yet in the word woman was
there an individual striving for liberty
chafing against even desirable bonds
against even dear responsibilities

  why i am only thirty-two cried
romola to herself as if making a dis-
covery her cheeks flamed at the im-
plication of her own words she felt as
if she had been caught in some disloy-
alty she ran up the stairs toward the
nursery swiftly she wanted roses
prattle to silence the reverberations of
that unblushing sentence she wanted
the familiar domestic machinery to
claim her entirely again

  but nurse doclcerty met her with
finger upon lip

  sh she whispered shes just
fallen asleep she and the little weston
boy quarreled and she got to crying
oh dear nom  he didnt hurt her-it
was just temper on our little ladys part
because he wouldnt let her have his
new blue bladder balloon but she ex-
hausted herself crying and i thought it
best for her to take a nap

  quite right mrs dockerly said
romola half sighing then she stood
idle at a loss for a second i think
ill go for a walk she announced
any errands

  nom nothing that i can think of
the awakening of cromola



why dont you go for a little walk
itll do you good

 the children wont be home for
lunch said romola pausing irreso-
lutely theres to be an expedition
after arbutus and a picnic luncheon i
think ill not come home either i
think-her face brightened-that ill
try to join them the nature-study class
theyre going to coreys woods of
course

  nurse dockerty cordially approving
of any plan that promised no interfer-
ence with her charge romola set off
she walked briskly the thought of the
children and their teachers helping to
silence in her mind the heretical thought
that evangeline dimock had planted
there

  at her quick springing pace she went
down from the heights through the
village pausing once to price the early
strawberries displayed in weilbroners
market it gave her a sense of being
again related to her own environment
and when she found herself saying
with thrifty housewifely authority that
the berries were too dear and that they
were sure to be sour besides so early
in the season she felt vaguely com-
forted

  across the tracks past the big red-
brick public-school building past the
dwindling rowr of mean houses where
the unelect of hazelwood dwelt across
the bridge beneath which ran one of the
river-feeding brooks of the countryside 
through the huddled cottages of the
italian settlement without which no
suburb is complete and  out into the
open country she walked

 coreys woods climbed up a bank
from the left of the road a half mile
beyond the last of the dilapidated huts
romola glanced at the watch strapped
about her wrist it was nearly one--
she ought soon to hear the sound of
childish voices and laughter she
struck up the ascent and veered from
the road that skirted the woods into the
rambling path that wandered through
them

  but even when she was well within
their green sanctuary there was 
guiding sound of young merriment to

 lead her on the liquid call of mating
 birds the faint rustle of tender new
 leaves-these were the pleasant noises
 that saluted her ears she scoured the
 woods-they were not so extensive as to
 harbor a whole noisy class of children
 unseen and unheard-but in vain miss
 de yere had apparently changed her
 mind about the arbutus excursion

   romola was rather hot from her hur-
 ried trip and the delusive spring energy
 had given place to real spring lassitude
 she took off the straw sailor that she
 wore and pushed the damp ringlets of
 soft pale-brown hair from her fore-
 head swinging the hat by its elastic
 stooping now and then to gather a vio-
 let she made her way back to the road

   and then she became conscious not
  only that it was the enervating spring-
 time but also that she had had no
 luncheon there was a comfortable
 bowlder where the hill road met the
 highway and back of it was the rotting
 post that supported a dim sign-to
 coreys woods  m-

   romola established herself upon the
 rock for a rest her little spurt of en-
 ergy was over and with it had gone the
 comfortable sense of the commonplace
 the mornings restlessness a little
 more languid now for her physical
 weariness again possessed her and
 through it half drowsily evangelines
 words repeated themselves

   her musing was interrupted by the
 sound of a motor car approaching from
 the direction of the city she looked
 uninterestedly along the way waiting to
 see it emerge from the curve half hid-
 den from her eyes by a clump of alders
 and birches it came more slowly than
 was the custom of automobiles on
 empty level highroads finally it
 made the curve but with a dislocated
 uncertain motion and with all the
 rhythmic quality gone from its puffing
 and chugging a few rods more it
 sputtered and jerked its way and then
 with a final leap it brought itself to a
 standstill fifty feet from romola
 bowlder

   she watched the two men in the ma-
 chine leap out and begin the usual in
 comprehensible gyrations under and


smiths magazine

around the car she had  particular
interest in their predicament but con-
tinued to watch them with the uncon-
scious intentness of an idle person
watching activity neither was any
one whom she knew-that she saw at
once-and it was a dull rather than an
intelligent eye that she fixed upon them
but by and by something in the move-
ments of the more slender more swift
figure seemed to touch a chord in her
memory the outlines half hidden
half suggested under the big tweed
coat seemed vaguely familiar

  it looks like some one i know said
romola to herself

  at that moment the man seized his
cap and threw it into the tonneau the
gesture was impulsive impatient half
comic and the sunlight shone upon a
yellow head

  his hair is as bright as roses
thought romola smiling with faint
amusement and sympathy at the little
burst of temper that had tossed the cap
away i never saw a grown person
such a goldilocks before it looks like
-it looks like-who is it that it looks
like

  the man had ceased his experimenta-
tions in repair and stood staring up and
down the road as if commanding suc-
cor to appear suddenly he spied ro-
mola the only human being in sight

  why it looks like wade robinson
smiled romola to herself

  her roving thoughts leaped back-
ward twenty years again she was a
schoolgirl in the ohio village where she
had been born it had not boasted the
line social distinctions of hazelwood
and rich and poor gentle and simple
had secured their early education in
the same brick schoolhouse

  it was in the grammar school half
girls half boys according to the un-
sentimental coeducational practice of
the community she was twelve she
stood at the blackboard tears beginning
to trickle-upon her flushed discomfited
cheeks and to form a chalky paste as
she tried surreptitiously to wipe them
away with her fingers algebra had
always been a bugbear to her

  she remembered how quietly and un-
obtrusively the boy next her had begun
to write the solution of her problem in
faint small figures low on the board
she remembered with a smile the
scared grateful disapproving glance
she had turned upon him

  i am not a cheet she had written
firmly if inconspicuously and unortho-
graphically in reply and the boy
scornful of virtue and angry at rebuke
had promptly rubbed out the helpful
figures and substituted for them the
words you are a dunce and had in-
formed her in a low voice that shed
know it when he offered to help her
again and that it was his firm opinion
she would never get out of the gram-
mar school

  he had refused to speak to her for
three days thereafter and then over-
taking her one afternoon umbrellaless
in a sudden shower he had stiffly of-
fered her the protection of his own she
knew that his fathers hostler had been
sent to the school with it-doctor rob-
inson and his wife were always so
fussy about wades taking cold
and she had walked beneath the um-
brella with a palpitating sense of being
very grown up it was almost like being
a lady-not an old one like ones moth-
er of course but a young one like ones
aunts-to have a male being walk be-
side one protecting ones tam-o-shanter
from the rain

  he had sent her a valentine that
year and had hung a may basket on
her doorknob the other boys had gig-
gled and had made her appearances
in the school yard periods of torture
to her by their impish chanting of
there goes wades girl there goes
wades girl until wade had thrashed
enough of them to make the chant un-
popular

  she had been a shy little girl and
however much her soul had thrilled
with pride over the subjugation of
wade she had treated him with a prim
unfriendliness that won her encomiums
from her aunts and that soon diverted
wades attention to more mannerly and
more appreciative little girls and the
next year she had moved and that had

romola tudor by all thats good he cried

been the end of the yellow-haired
wade

  she was half smiling at the youthful
memory when the disabled automobilist
approached her

  i beg your pardon be began with
a motion as if to doff his hat and a look
of surprise at not finding it oh i
forgot but can you tell me how- far i
am from hazelwood

 he had a thin tanned face and
bright blue eyes she looked at him for

a long second without answering and
when she did speak it was to say you
are wade robinson

  the mans face brightened his pierc-
ing eyes scanned her closely the
heavy tired lines about his mouth dis-
appeared in a sudden smile

  romola tudor by all thats good
he cried

  not now answered romola offer-
ing him her hand romola yentnor
youre about a mile from hazelwood


smiths magazine

  do you live there

   have lived there for twelve years
replied romola it sounded like an
eternity said in that tone

  good there is a destiny that
shapes our ends ive been cursing
luck and fate and everything else for
the past three weeks and all the time
they were leading me straight to an old
friend

  are you coming to settle in hazel-
wood romola asked the question in
faint surprise

  her old playmate did not seem to fit
into hazelwood  he looked too-too-
she did not know quite what word to
use he did not look suburban he
did not look like a person living in a
rut like a piece of domestic machinery
-her mind leaped back to evangelines
expression

  yes he answered her question dis-
contentedly ive bought your doctor
allens practice he lucky dog is go-
ing to germany for laboratory work
and i-im coming to hazelwood
well that doesnt seem quite so dark a
prospect as it did a while ago

  so you are a doctor like your fa-
ther 

  not so good a one as he replied
the young man loyally and not so
good a one as i had hoped to be you
see-under his tan he turned red as
if he were telling something shameful-
you see they found i wasnt as fit as
i ought to be about five years ago and
they sent me out to arizona im all
right now but tve got to live in the
country and do the family practitioner
act while what im longing for is the
clinic in new york or london or paris
well we dont get what we want in this
world always do we

  i dont know said romola primly
though her kind eyes rained pity upon
him ive been so very happy myself
it was with astonishment that she heard
her own words she who never talked
of her personal existence to be saying
a thing like this to a stranger on the
highroad for of course he was really
a stranger

  ah you thats different no

providence could be so unfair as to
deny you your happiness

  romola felt very sorry for him tte
looked much older than his years the
marks of illness and of pain were on
his thin face for all their keenness all
their brightness his eyes were those of
a disappointed man how cruel to give
a man intellect and ambition and then
to deny him the strength to work them
out

  are you married she asked she
hoped that he was she hoped that
something had been granted to him in
all its fullness to compensate for the
gifts withheld but he laughed shortly

  no thank heaven i havent any
unfortunate woman tied to my disabil-
ities he answered

  romola immediately sensed a woman
who had not stood the test who had
accepted freedom when love would
have burned to serve

  im sorry she said gently i had
hoped that you were happy in your
home even if you had had disappoint-
ments in your work but whats the
matter with your car

  chiefly the plain need of gasoline
he told her if hazelwoods so near
the man can walk in and get some
he called the chauffeur and gave
him quick curt directions romola
found herself rather liking the nervous
tension of his manner it was the man-
ner of a man who still felt things--
everything-vividly it did not re-
quire great events great calamities to
stir his sluggish emotions he had not
yet been converted into a domestic ma-
chine she jerked herself up impa-
tiently as she found the words again in
her mind she wished that evangeline
had not put them there

  when she was at home again the
restlessness the ennui of the morning
were gone a little flood of excitement
flowed through her a glow of pity
warmed her heart to be kind to ones
neighbors suddenly seemed to make
even a dull life worth while to offer
possibilities of charm to prosaic days
she was anxious for richard to come
home that she might tell him of the
wonderful encounter that she might
the awakening of romola



plan with him pleasant neighborly
friendly offices for the newcomer

  she listened with half an ear to the 
childrens story of how the coreys
woods expedition had been postponed
she yielded to roses imperious de-
mands for attention when that young
person was brought to her at tea time
without her usual keen perception of
the adorablenss of the child and her
usual conscientious realization of all the
work there was to do to develop her
properly

  richard was tired when he came up
from the five-forty-three

  where are the children he asked
after he had greeted romola with the
same absent-minded sort of kiss that he
had given her in the morning

  theyre all in the nursery theyre
to have their supper there to-night i
wanted to have dinner without them to-
night without ralph even

  a little frown appeared on richards
face

  its the second time this week isnt
it

  of course we cant have him at the
table when were giving a dinner an-
swered romola flushing slightly under
the implied rebuke

  all the more reason for having him
down when we havent company an-
swered richard you know romola

 dont hold at all with this modern idea
that servants can bring up children as
well as their parents

  the hurt red rose higher in romolas
face as she opened her lips to reply
then she thought better of it pressed
them firmly together and walked to the
window it was yielding to that first
impulse for retort that led to so much
bickering that made life so unspeakably
harsh and uglv she would repress it

  she looked out at the neat lawn with
its clumps of shrubs at the stone wall
and the trees along the road twelve
years of discipline had taught her to
control her little feminine impulse to-
ward hurt feelings it was only a
minute before she turned came up to
richard and told him in her usual tone
of voice about rudolphs activities of
the morning

  richard listened inattentively flung
one sharp question and grunted his
general dismissal of the affair

  hes tired said romola resolutely
to herself hell feel better when hes
been rested and fed

  she resolved to defer further con-
versation until after soup at least had
done its pacifying work

  did you go to call on mrs keith to-
day  demanded richard suddenly

  on mrs keith no did you think
that i was going romola looked at
him in honest surprise

  i certainly said that i wanted you
to call on her he answered

  i didnt understand it so said ro-
mola quietly i thought we talked it
over and  rather hoped-she smiled
-that you had been won to my point
of view i really dont see why i
should call on a woman whom i dont
know wdiose conspicuous way of life
makes me sure that i shant like her
why you know richard how often
weve agreed that it was perfectly use-
less for our kind and her kind to mix
and how glad weve always been that
hazelwood was our kind and not her
kind of a place

  i know weve been pharisaical
enough replied richard briefly

  i dont think it is necessarily phari-
saical to hold to ones standards re-
plied romola

  w ell pharisaical or not im afraid
well have to move with the rest of the
world the keiths have settled here
hes a man of enormous interests-the
biggest man this place has ever seen
we arent going to try to imitate their
style just because were civil enough to
recognize their existence there was a
tip came into the office to-day that they
were going to build it would be a very
good thing if we could get the house
to do you know the last two years
havent been unduly rich ones for liv-
ingston ventnor  grant

  i see romola answered there
was no scorn in her voice she hated
the exigencies of business but she rec-
ognized them and she forbade herself
to be her husbands critic ill call on
her to-morrow but i hope richard


smiths mag a zing

that i shant have to cultivate any sort
of intimacy with her you know im a
narrow-minded person and she frankly
strikes me as horrid

   dare say she wont be any keener
than you on cultivating an intimacy
said richard with masculine brutality
and to romolas laughing i suppose
not they went out to dinner

  but the shadow of the next days
visit lay over the meal all the spon-
taneous pleasure was gone from ro-
molas recollection of the meeting with
her old playmate when she finally re-
lated the incident it was colorless gray
and she could not wonder at richards
indifferent acceptance of it

  he ought to do well enough out
here he said selecting a cigar from
the humidor and critically cutting it
enough of the women are always im-
agining themselves sick to keep him
busy and those that dont imagine it
about themselves arc always able to
get up a scare about their children

  romola discreetly veiled her eyes
the first great surprise of her married
life had been the discovery that a man
was capable of holding the most tim-
orous views in regard to his own health
richard robust athletic was alarmed
by every symptom that visited him he
showed a concern about overshoes that
romola had at first thought comic and
had then accepted as a matter of course
he was fussy about his diet-he
called it being careful and in the
twelve years they had lived together
the doctor had never been in the house
on her account save when the children
were born

  yet she knew that her husband was
quite sincere when he uttered the fa-
miliar gibe at the hypochondriacs of
her sex the belief and the humor of
generations of men were ineradicable a
part of him beyond the power of any
personal experience to change part
of the domestic machinery said ro-
mola to herself

chapter it

  have a cigarette mrs yentnor
romolas hostess put the question with
a faint skeptical smile upon her lips

  romola shook her head and declined
with what she hoped was an easy non-
chalant manner-as easy and noncha-
lant as if she had accepted it was not
that she was so provincial a person that
she did not know that many women
smoked it was not even that she was
such a provincial person that she had
not seen women smoke and thought
nothing of it it was all in mrs keiths
covert jeer that her discomfort lay-
her sense of being gauche and awk-
ward and her resentment of the feel-
ing

  it does make ones fingers ugly
said mrs keith moving to the mantel
to find a match she showed romola
her hand as she came back hideous-
ly yellow isnt it ill have to bleach
them out some day soon wise of you
never to acquire the destructive habit

  it isnt that romola felt impelled
to say striving to maintain an indiffer-
ent dignity its-

  its the dear babies-that nice
harry graham man tells me you have
a brood and that youre quite the ideal
thing in mothers and you wouldnt
want to go home for bread-and-milk-in-
the-nursery and now-i-lay-me and
the whole blooming ceremonial of the
childrens hour reeking with smoke-
thats it isnt it it would be incon-
gruous thats the reason im against
children-the- make so many amusing
things incongruous youll have some
tea though wont you  she added
this as a japanese servant slid unob-
trusively in with a tea tray

  please said romola glad of the
respite lemon and no sugar and
rather weak no-no arrack thank
you

  how depraved and altogether aban-
doned you will think me mrs vent-
nor cried mrs keith dashing her
cup of tea liberally from the queer-
shaped glass-and-silver flask on the
tray well its better that you should
know the worst of me at once and
have it all over im frightfully intem-
perate as you see

  she half closed her dark eyes and
blew a wreath of smoke into the air
bending her sinuous bare neck to one
the awakening of romola



side romola watched her fascinated
feeling like an awkward schoolgirl be-
side her she was wearing a wonder-
ful chinese coat as a tea gown-gleam-
ing with baleful greens shimmering
with wonderful blues overlaid with
heavy gold embroideries hazelwood
had not seen its like before

  i dont think romola was driven
to say while her hostess watched her
through the blue pungent cloud of
smoke that you are attributing my
habits to quite the right causes i think
i do as i do and fail to do as-as-

  as other people do supplied deb-
orah keith

  as other people do laughed ro-
mola for no better reason than that
im a creature of habit and am likely
to go on as  have begun

 the deadly rut mrs keith
frowned impatiently at the idea i
should die of it monotony is only a
modified form of death

  romola felt that there was really
something to be said in favor of order
in favor of routine but she was
strangely tongue-tied in the presence of
this bright alien antipathetic person
ality it was not alone what- mrs
keith did what she wore what she
said that offended the other woman it
was the way in which she did things
wore things said things

 romola could picture evangeline
dimock handsome stalwart whole-
some smoking her cigarette and dash-
ing her tea with arrack without in any
wise suggesting lawlessness she could
even picture with a faint throb of
envy the gorgeous oriental garment of
her hostess clothing her own slim fig
nre and she knew that she would not
suggest the eastern siren to any human
being who might see her-she would
all the more because of the piquant con-
trast be the puritan the woman in
whose elegance there was always a
touch of austerity

  we are used to monotony here in
hazelwood answered romola so
used to it that youd never get us to
subscribe to your doctrine im afraid
you wont like our suburb if you are
sincere in your detestation of monotony

perhaps-she smiled at her hostess
across the little veil of smoke-perhaps
you never gave it a fair trial

  deborah keith laughed enough to
know that it would be the end of me
she declared but i dont intend to
find hazelwood monotonous im going
to wake it up oh im going to be a
real benefactor

  you havent passed much of your
life in suburbs said romola or you
wouldnt be so confident miss di-
mock tells me you have lived abroad a
good deal

  mrs keith nodded i havent been
in america before for three consecutive
months since i was fourteen she said
but im prepared to adore it mr
keiths interests have been largely brit-
ish-hes a scotchman you know-but
theyre likely to be almost exclusively
american for a long time now were
going to settle down and have a home
beware monotony warned ro-
mola with a smile then she changed
the subject what a charming old
place this ferguson house is dont you
think ive quite envied you having it
the situations rather good of
course the house is built on the worst
site on the property i dont care much
for it however were going to live in
it only until our new place is built
romola mindful of the diplomatic
errand on which she had come blushed
guiltily as she inquired how soon do
you expect to have your new house
ready 

  oh nothings been done about it yet
no plans drawn-no architect selected
bertram has been so busy getting his
office affairs settled that he hasnt had
a moment for the house but once he
gets to it i expect it to go up like an
aladdins palace by the way didnt
some one tell me that mr ventnor
built the malcolm house at rumsey
hills

  romola blushed still more guiltily as
she said that richard had indeed built
the suburban palace to which mrs
keith referred

  thats my idea of a very good-
looking place declared her hostess


smiths magazine

youll have some tea though wont you

lighting a fresh cigarette do you hap-
pen to know what it cost

  about a hundred and fifty thousand
i think said romola miserably then
she made the invariable supplementary
statement to which the building trades
arc accustomed but building is dearer
now than when that went up the
malcolms built about ten years ago
bertram will want to talk to mr
ventnor as soon as he has a chance
declared bertrams wife with a mag-

nificently patronizing air he had
thought some of maybew but he ad-
mires the malcolm place tremendously
and mayhews such a big man he wont
be offended even if we give our shack
to some one else though hes such a
friend that perhaps he might feel that
he has the first call on our building

  romola felt stiffly annoyed after
all she hadnt come there soliciting
work for her husband

  of course she said in rather a

  yes mrs keith nodded indiffer-
ently we went there when we land-
ed had supper there with mayhew
himself our first night amusing crea
ture isnt he

  i dont know him answered ro-
mola

 to know mayhew meant either one
of two things-either one was a great
personage an ornament of fashionable
society or one was a person of no posi
tioti at all merely one of the unconsid
ered throng wdio minister to great mens
hours of relaxation which romola
wondered were the keiths 

  ah we must have him out to din-
ner soon said mrs keith lightly and
you must meet him

  the loud ringing of the telephone in
the hall outside put an end to the con-
versation upon mr mayhew and his
attributes professional and personal
mrs keith listened with an air of ex
pectancy almost of intensity the
color ebbed from her dark skin and her
eyes gleamed the red line of her lips
tightened before the servant had time
to summon her she had jumped up and
started for the booth which was under
the turn in the hall stairs

 for me she demanded of the
japanese meeting him at the door

  yes madam he murmured

  from mr keith  she flashed at
him as she hurried by

  yes madam again answered the
servant imperturbably and came in to
remove the tea tray

  mrs keith did not trouble to close
the door of the booth and every word
that she uttered was borne back to
romola awkwardly waiting to make
her adieus

 not home until nine the wom-
ans voice was angry and loud why
not i said why not nonsense i
dont believe you i said i did not be-
lieve you ill come in town myself
well if you wont i dare say there
are other men who will you could if

you tried dont think that ill submit
to being bottled up out here in this hole
while you amuse yourself oh what
do i care for the telephone operator
then there was a seconds silence
while she listened intently to the re-
marks from the other end of the wire
romola blushing violently at her
necessitated eavesdropping had with-
drawn to the remotest corner of the
drawing-room and was trying desper-
ately to interest herself in the titles of
some books she welcomed the silence
then it was broken again by mrs
keiths voice changed but still audible

  its only because im so crazy about
you she declared you know that
dont you bert 

  then followed a few more mollified
words a good-by and she strolled back
into the room as undisturbed as if she
had not been making the slightest reve-
lation of herself her color was natu-
ral her eyes bright her full red lips
smiling it was romola who was un-
comfortably red and nervous

  im afraid you think im a horrid
shrew she remarked carelessly but
it does infuriate me so when bertram
calls me up to tell me he wont be home
for dinner doesnt it you

  i suppose they dont do it when they
can avoid it answered romola evad -
ing the personal question

  oh dont they mrs keiths in-
terrogative was purely formal i
wouldnt trust one of them she added
with great vivacity not one-my
own liege lord the least of all and i
never mean to play the part of the pa-
tient griselda

  im sure youll never have to
murmured romola struggling to es-
cape she extended her hand and went
on hastily im so glad i found you at
home im afraid i stayed terribly
long good-by

  mrs keith took her hand and held
it while she studied the delicately
flushed countenance of her caller

  ive shocked you horribly she
maintained you think im a vulgar
beast to quarrel with my husband over
the telephone you think conjugal
quarrels and conjugal affection and


smiths magazine

all other intimate things should be con-
cealed from public view well maybe
youre right but i dont really think
so if youre no longer upset by your
spouses failure to show up when you
expcct him if youre no longer jealous
and suspicious why my theory is that
youve ceased to care not merely that
youre a perfect lady and too well-bred
to make a parade of your feelings and
if you never felt angry and disappoint-
ed and jealous youve never cared
thats all

  now run along home to the dear
babies childrens hour approaches
i suppose youre really more interested
in them than in your husband thats
what children do for a woman-and
when she gets back to being interested
in her husband again lo and behold
lies not there in the spot where she left
him to wait until she got quite through
in the nursery awful heretic arent

i	 she laughed released romolas
hand and pushed her playfully into the
garden path

  romola set out for home vowing
that never again should any necessity
force her into the keith house she
was offended outraged heartless
noisy vulgar impertinent-there was
no end to the objugatory adjectives that
she applied to the newcomer in her
mind she walked quickly in order to
leave the offensive presence as far as
possible behind her she breathed
deeply of the soft spring air as if there
had been something noxious in the
physical atmosphere she had just left

  she told herself that she must try
to rid herself of all the unpleasant im-
pressions that resulted from her visit
before she reached home and the chil-
dren in a sudden half-morbid attack
of maternal conscientiousness it seemed
to her almost a sacrilege to go from the
presence of that scoffing common crea-
ture-so she termed her in her thoughts
-into that of the eager clear-eyed
little group at home

  and yet-and yet-romolas hurry-
ing pace slackened she forgot to draw
those deep indignant purifying breaths
-and yet the woman had had some-
thing that she lacked something that all

the women of her acquaintance lacked
and it was the lack of that something
she saw now which had made her rest-
less and dissatisfied only the day be-
fore that woman distasteful as was
her personality had a vivid intense
actual relation with her husband it
might be vulgar it might be hideous
with cheap jealousies commonplace
with petty endearments but it was
alive

  how long romola wondered had
they been married certainly- mrs
keith was no young girl-she was all
of five or six years older than romola
herself was it her childlessness that
had made her love for her husband so
much more vehement than any that
hazelwood was accustomed to but
there were plenty of childless marriages
in the suburb-the grahams had no
children the soptts had no children
half a dozen couples of whom she could
think were childless and yet there was
with them no such keen violent feel-
ing apparent as she had felt this after-
noon between the woman at one end of
the wire and the man at the other

  when she wondered had the thrill-
ing glory gone out of life for her and
richard had they ever really had it
she remembered their courtship-brief
tremulous but not intense she remem-
bered the afternoon when he had finally
proposed to her it had been a windy
autumn day and a jagged sunset was
burning in the west she had been vis-
iting in boston and his business had
brought him opportunely to the same
city and it had not made such demands
upon him as to prevent his being much
with her

  that day their walk after a sym-
phony concert had led them to the end
of a street walled in from the charles
the wind had whipped the water into
whitecaps the smoke from many
chimneys was blown this way and that
across the stormy red of the sky there
had been excitement passion in the air
and they had felt it

  when with a little shiver she had
turned from the sunset panorama and
had said let us go home he had
caught her hand and had held it close
the awakening of romola



and had said brokenly together
romola always together

 it had all been one the keen au-
tumnal air the vivid sky the waters
played upon by the winds her lovers
handclasp and his faltering words
what glamour what thrill what trem-
bling rapture what color life had
seemed to possess at that moment the
air about her had been palpitant with
glory the blood in her ears had sung
hosannas her veins had beat with de-
licious excitement that was what life
and love meant what they were to be to
her she had believed and now-the
thought of the well-ordered house of
the well-trained well-cared-for chil-
dren the busy excellent perfunctory
husband came upon her like a heavy
hand upon her eyes shutting out
beauty upon her lips shutting out air

 whose was the fault whose the de-
ceit that the promise of that glowing
vibrating november afternoon had not
been fulfilled had it been hers or
richards she could recall  time in
their life together where she had failed
him in wifely duty and affection where
he had failed her in any substantial
good ah that was it wifely duty
and affection were such poor substitutes
for ardor for yearning for all the de-
licious mystery and the soft excitement
of love substantial good was so dead
a thing after emotion 

  she was walking swiftly now flushed
with her exercise intent frowning a
little in the absorption of her problem
she had forgotten for the moment the
distasteful woman who had started her
thoughts upon this path and sudden-
ly a figure blocked her steps she
looked up startled inquiring the blue
eyes of her old playfellow laughed
down into hers

 oh gasped romola

 oh mimicked wade robinson 
havent seen any one so lost to the outer
world since i used to see you walking
home alone from school immersed in
some mighty algebraic conundrum

 he turned and walked by her side
she laughed confusedly she had a
guilty sense that the cause of her pre-
occupation must be apparent to him

     

  what was it he asked lazily smil-
ing down on her the big boys school
report or the little girls pinafores or
your own entertainment for the bridge
club 

  none of those she answered
but how do you happen to know so
much about the themes of ladies pre-
occupation 

  oh quite often they let me know
what theyre thinking about they like
me they let me play the tame cat by
their firesides you see he added bit-
terly his light pretense of self-com-
placency passing ive been a semi-
invalid and i dont count as a danger-
ous man

  she looked at him pitifully

  but youre better now

  yes-only confirmed in the habit of
not being a dangerous man im afraid

  why on earth should you want to
be a dangerous man demanded ro-
mola

  perhaps if you could see yourself
at this moment you would not need to
be told he answered again lightly
its normal for a man to desire to be
loved and feared and desired and
dreaded-not merely to be pitied and
given a warm corner by the fire because
hes out of the running

  if you want to spread havoc she
laughed perhaps you will find hazel-
wood just ripe for you there are lots
of eligible girls and a painful dearth of
eligible men and a new doctor a bach-
elor will put zest into the dull situa-
tion

  i have a foreboding that i shall not
add to the gayety of the eligible maid-
ens he returned

  she flushed uncomfortably under the
look he bent upon her

  how soon are you to be really es-
tablished here she asked formally

  i go back to town to-morrow and
return for good next monday

  you must dine with us at once and
meet all the people-or as many of them
as the dining room will hold richard
-she prevaricated-was so interested
to hear that you were settling among
us

  they had reached the heights and


smiths magazine

her home lay before her substantial a
little pretentious highly conventional
eminently respectable eminently pros-
perous she caught a glimpse of roses
bright head on an upper porch the
child saw lur and screamed and waved
a greeting romola fluttered a hand-
kerchief in reply

  what a sunbeam commented doc-
tor robinson after im settled here
i may come over some afternoon and
make her acquaintance

  surely and ill arrange the dinner
for the first night when both you and
richard are free good-by

  she gave him her hand and hurried
into the house the encounter with
him had diverted her thoughts for a
few minutes but as she entered the hall
charming tasteful in the same fashion
of charm and tastefulness as the halls
of half hazelwood the feeling of irri-
tation of restlessness of question fell
upon her again what had stifled emo-
tion in her life what had smothered
romance to death and what was
there left for a woman-a good wom-
an a conscientious woman a high-
minded woman-when romance had
perished from her days 

  i am only thirty-two protested
romola to fate as she went upstairs to
the nursery and she decided to try to
coerce romance a little

  i am going to have ralph eat his
supper with the other children to-
night she told nurse dockerty do
you know where he is

  nurse dockerty did not know but
she thought that he was in his room
romola looked for him there and
found him curled up with a book on his
window seat she rubbed a caressing
hand over his forehead and pushed
back his thick pale-brown hair

  why did you come in so early
honey she asked him

  i wanted to read replied ralph
he held up the volume to her it was
ivanhoe

  its a splendid story dear she said
but you ought to be out playing until
sundown youre in school so many
hours now that your father and i want
you to spend as much time as possible

between school and dinner out of
doors

  id rather read said the boy

  she did not press the question fur-
ther then-she never nagged her chil-
dren or her husband-but told him that
he was to have supper in the nursery
that evening he acquiesced indiffer-
ently the honor of dining with the
grown-ups to which he had been pro-
moted at nine did not particularly af-
fect him

  are you going to have company
he asked

  no not to-night

  is father going to be very late

  not that i know of replied rom-
ola

  then why- began the boy ques-

tioningly but broke off to say not
that i care you know mother id
just as lief eat sometimes with the kids
only i just wondered

  its just a-a little anniversary of
fathers and mothers explained rom-
ola

  that was not exactly accurate but it
was more comprehensible to the ten-
year-old than if she should tell him she
was going to try to bring back a little
of the olden glamour into her life by
making richard ventnor forget that he
was an architect a householder and a
father and by making him remember
that he had once been a lover it was
too precious a thing that romance of
youth to be allowed to die crushed to
death by mere domesticity

  she ordered certain changes in the
dressing of the dinner table-the every-
day greenery of the fern dish was re-
placed by sweet peas pink and lavender
and white the candle shades were
changed from their customary yellow
to a bridal sort of white and silver
then romola dressed herself with more
than her usual care selecting a gown
that richard had always liked-ashes-
of-rose silk and cobwebby lace-instead
of the year-before-lasts black net that
had been doing duty as a home dinner
dress

  she met him at the front door after
the habit of their early married days
he bent to give her his customary
the awakening of romola



salutation when lie drew back he
glanced at her a second time and a
slight frown appeared upon his fore-
head

   didnt know we had a dinner on
for to-night he observed

 we havent explained romola
im gorgeous all for you

  thats nice of you

  his tone was relieved and indifferent
glad of a festivity avoided unstirred by
her beauty or the flattery of her frock
she felt annoyed rather than hurt but
not even the annoyance was strong
enough to ruffle her much how differ-
ently would mrs keiths emotions be-
have in such a situation she reflected 

  when the waitress announced dinner
richard who had been in the library
arranging papers on his desk came into
the dining room and stared at the pretty
table but his only remark was

  where is ralph to-night out for
supper 

  no i let him have his supper with
the other children in the nursery i-
i-i wanted you to myself this even-
ing

  she blushed as she spoke but the
blush was one of shame she was
shocked to find how the gracious words
were a hypocrisy she did not par-
ticularly want richard to herself that
evening she only wanted in some way
to make herself want him to make him
want her alone in the sweetness of a
solitude a deux

  that was very sweet of you com
mented richard after a slightly bewil
dered look at her but you have me
so much to yourself after the boy has
gone to bed- he broke off con-
scious that he was not being tactful re-
sentful of the necessity of being tactful
with a wife of twelve years standing

  do i romolas voice was a trifle
cold its usually the evening paper
and the work you bring out from the
office isnt it that you give your even-
ing to

  then she caught herself up shortly
this was a bad beginning she always
avoided criticisms recriminations why
on earth should she begin them to-night
of all nights-when she meant to win

back a little of the luster of youth to
gild the drab of approaching middle
age

  ive never thought of myself as a
very neglectful husband replied rich-
ard a little aggrieved if i have
worked at night it was because i had
to because this house had to be cleared
not because i wanted to neglect you
no  dont think you can fairly call me
a neglectful husband

  he had no slightest taste in the world
for a roisterers life but he still counted
it a virtue in himself that he did not
subject romola to the uncertainties of a
roisterers wife

  of course you arent a neglectful
husband agreed romola firmly re-
pressing a desire to tell him of his
shortcomings

  well then said richard

  there was a few minutes silence
romola was fighting her desire to say
something bitter richard having no
such battle on his hands spoke first
did ralph stay out this afternoon
no he was at home reading tvan-
hoe when i came in

  weve simply got to keep him out of
doors more hes growing so and he
hasnt enough color he doesnt seem
to care for sports at all the father
looked worried

  hes like me at that age romola
gave up the struggle for romance one
could not upset the domination of the
merely domestic just by keeping chil-
dren away from the dinner table

  im thinking seriously of sending
him to a boys camp for the summer-
one of those places where they are made
to row and swim and play ball pur-
sued richard a place where they
have to do it as they have to learn book
lessons in school

  t should be worried all the time
cried romola

  nonsense her husband answered
vigorously not half so much danger
as at home here where he has no one
to direct his activities

  im sure- began romola flush-
ing but richard interrupted im not
saying that you neglect him in the least
romola he assured her i am only


smiths magazine

saying that the home is not giving him
what he needs at this particular period
of his life ill look into the camp ques-
tion to-morrow he continued to
meditate with a slightly anxious look

  romola fell silent silence had al-
ways been her refuge against unlovely
speech and she knew that any words
that might pass her lips now would be
unlovely ones-tart or whimpering
she applied herself to her salad as if
it were the one really important thing
in the world to her the lump in her
throat almost prevented her swallowing
it but she realized that what she felt
w-as chagrin rather than sorrow she
was not possessed by grief that her
husband  longer loved her but by
annoyance that her plans had miscar-
ried in other words she told herself
with a mixture of resignation and of
horror she also no longer loved ah
well she supposed that this was what
life was

  richard obtuse to all the currents in
the air broke the silence by and by
with dull petty gossip of his office
romola conscientiously enlarged her
monosyllables to sentences and what
passed for conversation in half the
houses in hazelwood went on after
coffee richard withdrew again to his
study he had a small private commis-
sion one of his neighbors wanted a
new wing built-a matter too trifling
for the firm to handle but not for
richard in his spare time

  youre going to work this evening
romola asked in the resigned tone of
one expecting an affirmative answer as
he turned toward his study

  yes there isnt anything on to-
night is there

  she shook her head and there was
a tinge of bitterness in her gray eyes
and on her faintly smiling lips this
then was the end of romance-that
married lovers should see each other
only when there was something on

  richard though not quick in catch-
ing subtleties was uncomfortably
aware of the meaning of his wifes
glance he justified himself

  readings addition may mean a mo-
tor car for you he told her

  i havent been clamoring for a mo-
tor car have i asked romola gently

  no youre not like some women
thank heaven

  but the compliment left her quite un-
moved she wandered into the living
room and seated herself in the mellow
lamplight with a book in her hands
but she did not read it-only gazed
across the room and out into the dark-
ness unseeingly when the telephone
in the hall rang she sprang to answer
it it was the grahams asking romola
and richard to come up and make a
second table of bridge

  richards busy but ill see if he can
come said romola dutifully

  she went to his study door and spoke
to him

  yes ill come he answered that
is if theyre not going to play for high
stakes i wont go higher than half a
cent a point

  all right ill tell them said rom-
ola moving back toward the tele-
phone

  to her own mind even that half-cent
concession to the grahams insistence
upon stakes was a truce with evil but
she and richard had been over that
ground before she repeated his mes-
sage to the grahams and came back

  they say to come anyway she an-
nounced

  she drew a cape from the coat closet
in the turn under the stairs she was
glad to get away from her charming
house glad to leave that for which she
and richard had labored long and had
sacrificed so much of irresponsible hap-
piness it seemed to her to-night as if
it were the handsome monument they
had erected over the grave of young
ardor and as they walked along the
path toward the grahams something
within her kept repeating that she was
only thirty-two

chapter hi

  every one uttered a little exclamation
of admiration as the dinner guests filed
into the keiths dining room one even-
ing late in june the table was very
large-the newcomers were entertain-
the awakening of romola



her dark eyes were shining her white teeth flashing
her loud laughter ringing from the
arrival of the first guest

wonderful sconces against the side wall
or in beautiful candlesticks placed here
and there and every place except the
dining table bore as many velvety red
roses as it could carry the room was
full of their warm sweet scent as in-
toxicating as wine

  deborah keiths frock which had
caused a first though immediately re-
pressed gasp from her women guests

ing almost all of that section of hazel-
wood which was given to social amen-
ities-and in its center there was a
miniature japanese garden-lake
bridges rockeries and all

 mrs keith who had a mind above
the petty accuracy of schools and pe-
riods had had this centerpiece ar-
ranged upon a wonderful tablecloth
inset lavishly with renaissance lace it
caused the eyes of her feminine guests
to expand with adoring envy they
had never before seen such a piece ex-
cept in museum collections

 everything was on the same scale of
magnificence hitherto unapproached in
the suburban festivities the array of
glasses at each place was beautiful-
color here glimmering here vivid
shape delicate quality-all unap-
proached in the hazelwood experience
the room was lighted with hundreds of
wax candles or so it seemed stuck in


smiths magazine

was of the same color as the velvety
rose petals almost of the same tgxture
one would have said it was almost
molded to her supple figure it re-
vealed every curve of her body even
where it affected to clothe her and
hazelwood had never seen in its own
set a gown that frankly left bare
so much of the wearers person across
her shoulders slender bands of crystal
held up the low-cut bodice her arms
were bare their whole white dimpled
length her throat and bosom were
more exposed than even the most ex-
perienced in decolletage had ever seen
a respectable womans before

  it was curious to see the effect of the
gown  evangeline dimock drew a scarf
across her handsome shoulders maude
scott fumbled at her laces to lower
them but deborah keith seemed un-
aware of the sensation her appearance
created her dark eyes were shining
her white teeth flashing her loud laugh-
ter ringing from the arrival of the first
guest

  in spite of romolas resolution not to
know mrs keith circumstances and
her husbands will had been too strong
for her all hazelwood knew the
keiths all hazelwood was already
responding to their influence-was be-
coming livelier showier it was im-
possible to avoid them-they were
everywhere they pervaded the coun-
try club with noisy parties from town
they drove the swiftest cars over the
highways they were always inviting
half the suburb off on motor trips on
theater trips-on any sort of trip that
broke the monotony of day-by-day ex-
istence as hazelwood had always
known it and-this to romola was
most important-they had given rich-
ards firm the commission for the new
house which was regardless of the in-
creased cost of building to surpass the
one at rumsey hills

  richard was much elated it had
been a sort of revelation to romola-
his eagerness to secure the job his pride
in his success she saw that for a man
at any rate for such a man as her hus-
band there wras no need of a quick
living love to supply color to his days

his ambitions his interests in his busi-
ness were exciting were thrilling
enough having these doubtless he pre-
ferred that his personal life should be
dull a sedative to the intensity of the
other

  she had resented silently perhaps al-
most unconsciously his eagerness about
that new house it had not increased
her satisfaction made her more toler-
ant even when the debated automobile
wasthe result of the commission one
automobile had come to seem a small
rather a mean thing in hazelwood-
did not the keiths keep three

  to-night she was rather surprised to
find that she was to have the seat of
honor at her hosts right she knew
well enough with the unfailing intui-
tion of women that deborah keith did
not like her she knew that the an-
tipathy that she felt for deborah could
be no one-sided affair therefore her
surprise to find herself going out to the
dining room with bertram keith-a
man who had baffled her since her first
moment of meeting him by her com-
plete inability to classify him

  physically he was as colorless as his
wife was brilliant-a tall lean large-
boned man with drabbish-brown hair
and a tough smooth skin that seemed
of one color with it where it melted into
it at the forehead his eyebrows and
eyelashes though heavy enough were
of the same drab line so was the
rough mustache at which he kept con-
stantly pulling

  his eyes romola had decided in her
furtive scrutiny of them were the vio-
let color of which one reads more often
than one sees it sometimes they
seemed gray and piercing sometimes
clouded and melancholy there was a
rather kindly light in them for her she
had noticed early in their intercourse-
almost the sort of idle friendly look
that a kindly disposed father gives to
children not his own

  his voice and manner were generally
as quiet as his wifes were noisy but
once or twice there had flashed from
him the intimation that he could be
roused into a rather ugly temper

  far down one side of the big table
the awakening of romola



sat the great mayhew mrs mayhew
was not among the guests the omis-
sion seemed to romolas critical mind
to establish the keiths social standing
on the lower of the two planes to which
she had assigned mayhews acquaint-
ances in her thoughts she had met
him on his more casual appearances at
the keiths where his wifes absence
meant nothing but even as she con-
gratulated herself upon her shrewdness
a chance word across the table showed
that mrs mayhew was abroad there
was no deducing anything derogatory to
to-nights hostess then from her ab-
sence from the table

  well romola reflected it must be a
pleasure to mrs mayhew to be abroad
when mayhew was in america she
had never seen a man to whom she had
taken a more instantaneous dislike
she disliked everything about him-his
great size-he was over six feet tall
broad-framed and almost grossly fat-
his thick wiry black hair upstanding
from his forehead his bold roving
fairly insulting black eyes which chal-
lenged every womans the roll of his
full red lips unconcealed even by his
heavy black beard a huge animal he
seemed to her lusty and powerful and
repulsive with a quality that no animals
possess-suggestiveness lewdness

 by what freak had ability genius
even been given to such a satyr for
not even romolas disgust toward him
could blind her to the fact that his work
was good-more than good-exquisite
uplifting his were the only buildings
in america that she had ever thought
deserving of the old definition of archi-
tecture-frozen music

 he had been a horrible disappoint-
ment to her when she had first met him
some weeks before it had been part
of her new and growing grievance
against richard that he had declined to
see mayhew with her eyes and had in-
timated that she was foolish over-
strained womanish in short to read so
much grossness into the mans person-
ality

  she had been studying him across the
table while her host was busy with the
woman on his left suddenly mayhew

turned his full eyes directly upon her
his unpleasant smile lit up his face
he inclined his head toward her rais-
ing the long-stemmed glass that the but-
ler had just filled

  a glass of wine with you madam
he said and the ancient phrase of cour-
tesy arid compliment fell from his lips
with an effect of mockery

  yet his full glance was one of ad-
miration half a dozen pairs of eyes
followed the direction of his and rom-
ola felt herself unpleasantly conspicu-
ous to have refused his challenge
which was what she longed to do
would only have made her more so
accordingly she touched her lips to her
glass and inclined her head with a
faint chilly little smile

  unconsciously as she set the glass
down her eyes sought richards he
was looking at her with a half frown
a little farther along the table sat
wade robinson and from his blue eyes
there flashed a message of understand-
ing and of sympathy gratefully she
thought how keen his intuitions were
forgetting for a moment that in the
freedom of intercourse that had grown
up between her and her old schoolmate
since his coming to hazelwood she had
expressed herself fully enough on most
topics to render the use of hjs intuition
superfluous

  doctor robinson had taken evange-
line dimock out to dinner and as rom-
olas gaze included them both she was
struck with something new in her
friends expression evangeline had
always been handsome in a stalwart
healthy style but her face for all its
vigor of coloring and clearness of mod-
eling had lacked animation-softness-
elusiveness-charm to-night some-
thing had happened to give her at least
some of these qualities romola seemed
to see her freshly as one sometimes sees
a familiar landscape heightened and
softened by some nebulous play of sun-
shine and shadow

  why how lovely evangeline is to-
night her first thought was and close
upon it followed another more startled
why shes falling in love with
wade


smiths magazine

  fascinated by her discovery she con-
tinued to watch them for a few sec-
onds evangelines eyes always bright
were dewy there was something ap-
pealing wistful about her quick smile
almost pathetic was her look of young
expectancy romola eagerly trans-
ferred her regard to wade he was
laughing and talking with his usual ani-
mation his usual air of attentive inter-
est but-and her heart gave a throb of
relief at her reading of his manner-
there was no answering glow to that
upon evangelines face

  a dinner table bright with lights
buzzing with conversation noisy hilari-
ous was no place for searching of soul
for rigorous self-examination yet
romola was astounded frightened by
that throb of her heart she could
scarcely bring her attention back from
her own amazed perception of her own
emotional confusion to listen to what
her host was saying she did not know
how long he had been addressing her
she turned toward him with an apolo-
getic flush

  i beg your pardon she cried im
afraid i didnt hear what you were say-
ing my wits always go woolgathering
in a crowd-its so absorbing to watch
people and to speculate about them
dont you think 

  greatest fun in the world he an-
swered her reassuringly we used to
have a game when i was a young chap
first married-a game of guessing what
people were as they came aboard a train
or steamer game of guessing what their
errands were fie stopped abruptly
and a curious flush traveled up the pale
drabbish brownness of his skin then
he added abruptly but what was your
game  about whom were you specu-
lating of course we play with
marked cards here-weve got a line on
all these people

  do you think we ever really have a
line on people as you put it asked
romola to divert his thoughts of
course she was not going to be guilty
of the disloyalty of gossip about her
friend however disguised under the
mask of psychological speculation i
sometimes think we never know any

one-husbands their wives mothers
their children and what do we really
know then of the people we call our
friends 

  again she seemed to have uncovered
a conversational pitfall for the dull
color traveled once more up bertram
keiths face in the glance he bent
upon her steely blue sharp hostile
there was intimation of the force and
the ability which the men said were
making him although a newcomer in
the country a success a force in it

  very true he answered in a curi-
ous measured voice after all what
do we know of one another you say
doctor robinson is a childhood ac-
quaintance of yours an old schoolmate
perhaps your first lover but what do
you know about him in all the years
since pinafores and lollipops and as
for deborah and me-how do you know
we arent a pair of escaped murderers
living on the proceeds of our assassina-
tions 

  for all the extravagant lightness of
his words his eyes were gimlets boring
into her thoughts but she laughed
the grotesque unreality of his jest
somehow cleared the air

  you ought to be a writer of the kind
of fiction im always confiscating from
my young son its a pity for such an
imagination to be wasted such a gift
for the horrific i hope it was not with
such ghastly speculations that you and
mrs keith used to entertain yourselves
aboard those steamers and trains 

  she looked up at him bright-eyed and
smiling the flush had ebbed from his
face and left him rather paler than his
wont

  no in those days we were young
idealists mrs keith and i he an-
swered quietly but tell me about
your boy i think ive seen him riding
his bicycle down into the village he
looks like you does he not

  i like to think so replied romola
with a tender smile hes a dear boy
though not as robustious in his tastes
as richard wishes him to be so im
dreadfully afraid that hes to be taken
from me for two months this summer
and sent to a boys camp where his
the awakening of romola



father thinks he will learn all manner
of hardy things

  whats his name  asked her host

  ralph

 ralph thats the name- he

paused abruptly thats the name of
a favorite nephew of mine he ended
the sentence with a sort of definiteness
not with the lingering upward intona-
tion of the man who wants to talk about
his favorite nephew

  and then the man on the other side
of her demanded romolas opinion on
the newest book which she hadnt read
discovering her deplorable ignorance
this young gentleman-he was an im-
portation from town-seemed stranded
for further conversation with her and
returned to discourse with his right-
hand neighbor who w-as more adequate-
ly supplied with small talk than was
romola and romolas gaze again
stole down the table toward evangeline
and wade robinson

  something of the glow had departed
from her friends face she sat star-
ing about her twisting the stem of a
wineglass while wade across the
woman  his other side talked with
old doctor cartwright catching rom-
olas eyes evangeline made a little
grimace and gave a little shrug expres-
sive of boredom and romola shook a
reproving head in her direction

 when the women had withdrawn
from the dining room and were scat-
tered through the long old-fashioned
parlors and the piazza opening from
them evangeline sought romola

   come into the garden maud 
she quoted jocosely you dont want
any more coffee-do you-and you
never do take liqueurs and i want to
talk to you cant we find a corner on
the piazza

  i suppose so romola answered
following her friend out through the
long french window

  but when they reached their secluded
corner and romola was ensconced in
a big cushioned chair while evange-
line seated on therail above her leaned
against a pillar the girl did not seem so
eager for talk she sat her clear-cut
features outlined in profile against a big

lilac bush grow-ing close to the porch
her eyes fixed  the stars

  well said romola suggestively by
and by have you forgotten what you
were going to say or have you changed
your mind about saying it or what
evangeline threw away the cigarette
from which she was blowing faint
rings into the starlit darkness

  oh i didnt have anything in par-
ticular to say i only wanted to get
away from that gabbling crowd have
you ever heard any one make as much
noise as our hostess and did you
ever ever in your life see such
clothes 

  you arent going to sit on the ladys
porch and discuss her  hope

  youre so refined scoffed evan-
geline but not at all modern  she
wouldnt care she expects you to do
it-just as she would

  there was a moments silence as
romola lazily declined to enter upon an
argument then evangeline spoke
again still looking starward  that new
man seems rather a good sort-your
doctor robinson

  romola could not explain to herself
just what sort of somersault her emo-
tions performed the chief feeling of
which she w-as conscious was one of
chill toward evangeline she felt her-
self shutting the doors upon her friend
as it were there was something that
seemed to her own ears almost fiarcl in
her smooth voice as she replied

  he seems very pleasant i think
youve seen rather more of him than i
since he came to hazelwood he was
a nice enough boy when we were chil-
dren 

  not very happy i should say
hazarded evangeline in a carefully re-
mote indifferent voice

  i suppose his illness was a blow to
his ambition replied romola

  do you think hes entirely cured 
evangelines voice rang anxious in
spite of herself

  i suppose theres always the liabil-
ity of a return with that disease an-
swered romola very impersonally
but of course as a physician himself


smiths magazine

she seemed some brilliant spirit of lawlessness daring every one who saw her to let go as she had done
to snatch at the vivid pulsating joy of the moment

he must have calculated all the
chances

  but he might be the sort of man
with a streak of recklessness in him
speculated evangeline who would
rather risk a good deal to do what he
wanted to do than be safe doing the
thing that he hated and i gather he
did hate it out there in arizona

  romola fought down a feeling of un-
mistakable annoyance at evangelines
intimate interest intimate knowledge

of wade robinsons temperamental
possibilities but before she could dis-
associate her thoughts from criticism
and make a commonplace rejoinder
there was an influx of masculine voices
and laughter into the room behind them
and in a moment the subject of their
conversation had joined them

  romola was debating the desirability
of leaving of giving evangeline the
chance that the older woman thought
she too obviously desired when harry
the awakening of romola



graham came to the window and called
his sister-in-law

  theyre going to play bridge in the
library he announced and doctor
cartwright is clamoring for you eve
evangeline went more or less reluc-
tantly and wade dropped into a chair
beside romola her long white gloves
lay in her lap he leaned over and idly
apparently unconsciously took one up
and smoothed it out

  nice girl your horsy friend he
said indicating the departing evange-
line i like her she isnt over happy
is she

  i dont see why not said romola
curbing a desire to be acid shes
young handsome healthy she doesnt

have to worry about money and-

  she tried to think of other blessings
in evangelines lot but wade inter-
rupted 

  you dont mean to tell me that you
think those things mean happiness
most of them are equally true of any
heifer in a dairy herd

  well laughed romola ive never
thought of the dairy heifer as suffering
from a vague melancholy

  she liked to banter with him she
felt a sudden sense of lightness of
gayety of spring of returning youth

  well admitted doctor robinson
you may be right about the heifer she
may not serve as the type of female
longing and unhappiness but i firmly
decline to accept her as the type of the
satisfied full life

  what would you take as the type
then 

  romola leaned back and watched him
with lazy pleasure as she asked the
question the light from the room be-
hind was not bright enough to bring
out the lines of illness and disappoint-
ment in his face but it revealed attrac-
tively enough the better points of his
physiognomy-the fine modeling the
alert poise of the head the quick smile

  wade drew his fingers along the
length of white kid which he still held
before he answered he looked at her
dubitatively

  why not yourself

  i

  romola was suddenly unreasonably
angry at his reply what-had she
been discovering all the losses and lacks
in her life had she been learning for
the past month the emptiness the dull-
ness of her existence to hear now that
it presented a picture of ideal womanly
satisfaction and this from the lips
of the one man of her acquaintance
who she had believed understood and
sympathized with the colorlessness of
her days she was no adept in satire
but she essayed it now

  oh of course she exclaimed  im
happy im completely satisfied
havent i just received an automobile
what more does any proper hazelwood
wife desire-unless perhaps another
one

  ah  doctor robinsons exclama-
tion was long and low he leaned to-
ward her with a look of eagerness do
you remember he asked what car-
lyle has said on the subject of the full
satisfied life it is to the effect that
not all the pastry cooks in europe can
satisfy the soul of a single bootblack i
have often thought about it-that there
is not enough in all the dearly desired
material things in the world to com-
plete the happiness of the meanest of
us

  ive thought of it to comfort myself
when all the material goods were denied
me-health and money success fame-
and what they might have purchased-
love when i was down and out
knocked out of the running and now
in other words you are telling me the
same thing-that there is something in
a womans heart that homes and hus-
bands automobiles and lovely frocks
even children do not utterly satisfy
not youth and strength not love not
power to arouse love are enough or
is it only in women like you that not all
these good gifts can smother the divine
spark of discontent

  romola heardhim a little dazed it
was on her lips to tell him that her life
was not the rich completed one he had
been pleased to picture and that its
lack was love was romance was the
gilding on the gingerbread but greatly
as he had broken down the barriers of


smiths magazine

her reserve she was still a reticent
woman she could not talk of her emo-
tions so that there was an effect of
rebuke of rebuff in her answer

  i dont know im not very intro-
spective

  you mean said doctor robinson
swift to perceive a little piqued at his
perception that you dont choose to let
me share the result of your introspec-
tion quite right my dear mrs vent-
nor quite right let us keep the poor
beggar in his place even though we did
know him when we were children
and even though we know he is the
most harmless poor devil that crawls
for all his presumption in daring to
think about what goes  in our mind
you know it isnt that cried rom-
ola wretched at the imputation of
severity with another man the charge
would not have concerned her at all but
to seem harsh to her old playmate a
sick man at that why it was like being
harsh with ralph when he came to her
with childish fancies and speculations

  why are you afraid to let me see in-
side your mind romola  wade
leaned toward her and asked the ques-
tion with a measured deliberation

  she had a moment of panic of
breathlessness there stole upon her a
sort of languorous half fright that was
not wholly unpleasant and that seemed
to be curiously related to the touch of
his thin hand upon her glove her
voice sounded far away almost dreamy
to her own ears as she replied but
im not afraid

  there was a loud blare o  music be-
hind them some one seated at the
piano in the long room had struck a
peremptory chord commanding atten-
tion romola started to her feet and
moved quickly toward the window
though wades outstretched hand
caught at her floating draperies and
though his voice tremulous as her own
had been whispered

  dont go dont go romola

  the few steps between the corner in
which she had been seated and the
window were like a thousand miles to
her so completely did the yielding in-

explicable mood that had frightened her
pass that moment of intimacy of
revelation of danger had scarcely
more reality to her standing by the
window than the vague dream that pre-
cedes waking has when the eyes are
fully opened and actuality-life-have
called us out of slumber

  oh come she cried looking back
toward him after a glance into the room
had shown her what was happening
come mrs keith is going to dance

  wade rose listlessly and sauntered to
the window

  what do i care for mrs keiths
dancing he asked half sulkily but
when he looked into the room he ex-
claimed in involuntary tribute by
jove

  deborah keith had changed her din-
ner costume for that of a spanish
danseuse it was wonderful how it be-
came her with her dark eyes and hair
she had stained her red lips to even a
more vivid carmine and had exagger-
ated and emphasized all her natural col-
oring her guests men and women
alike were applauding the picture she
made as she stood poised waiting to be-
gin even the besotted bridge players
in the library left their game to stand
at the parlor door and laugh and clap
their hands at the unaccustomed sight

  romola caught a glimpse of bertram
keiths face across the room it was
flushed and smiling and his eyes dark-
ened by excitement and admiration
were bent devouringly upon his wife
behind him his cards still in his hand
stood harry graham his broad face
also alight even richard was ap-
plauding

  the dance strains sounded and deb-
orah keith began her performance it
was unbelievably good as far as its
technique went the room buzzed with
murmurs in which the names of all the
famous dancers of the world were com-
pared with her and not to her reproach
grace fire abandon-all these she had

  romola watching felt her breath
coming short the exhibition was af-
fecting her as no dance she had ever
before witnessed had done her own
blotfd seemed to keep time to the meas-
the awakening of cromola



res to which deborah keiths feet re-
sponded so lightly so wildly up and
down the long room cleared in the cen-
ter she whirled and swayed she
seemed some brilliant spirit of law-
lessness daring every one who saw her
to let go as she had done to give rein
to impulse to snatch at the vivid pul-
sating joy of the moment finally
when with a last exquisite gesture of
abandonment she threw-herself upon a
low couch piled with many-colored
cushions the whole audience gave a lit-
tle gasp

 harry graham quite white with ex-
citement despite his outdoor red and
tan hurried to her with a scarf to wrap
her shoulders mayhew with his sug
gestive smile upon his thick lips
brought her a glass of wine her hus-
band came and leaned over the back of
the couch on which she had flung her-
self and his hand rested against her
shoulder

 florence graham placid and plump
-daily plumper since the advent of
the second graham automobile-spied
romola in the long french window
she advanced to speak to her

 wouldnt the fergusons have had a
fit she gurgled

 the fergusons whose country estate
had once comprised half the present
suburb had built the rambling house
fifty years before they were famous
according to the hazelwood standards
-he for a treatise on the greek iota
subscript and she for having organized
the first antinicotine society in new
jersey romola thought it extremely
likely that they would have had a fit
could they have witnessed the desecra-
tion of their home

 florence went on cheerfully she
really dances as well as a professional
doesnt she  see all the men flocking
about her-even richard and harry -
old married fogies like them oh-
she caught sight of wade robinson
standing at romolas shoulder in the
semidarkness of the piazza-oh
theres one who isnt i didnt see you
before doctor robinson dont you
want to go in and join the court

 there was nothing unamiable in

florences babbling manner however
her words might read

  not while you and mrs ventnor are
here doctor robinson answered with
trite gallantry

  i have sometimes thought of taking
up fancy dancing myself florence
prattled on might be a good reducer
i tell you doctor robinson if you
really want to be a boon to hazelwood

and to make mints of money-

  if doctor robinson interrupted
laughing

  well then all you have to do is to
discover a way in which women over
thirty can keep their waistline without
too much dieting said florence quite
seriously

  i can do that answered the doctor
but it wont make me a boon to hazel-
wood for no one will follow my pre-
scription  and it wont fill my empty
pocketbook for it will make me very
unpopular

  youre joking answered florence
what is the prescription 

  sell your automobiles dismiss your
chambermaids walk to-what is the
name of the market man-to weil-
broners every day instead of telephon-
ing play golf instead of bridge and cut
out a course from every meal how do
you like the prescription mrs
graham he finished laughing as he
caught full sight of florences crest
fallen face

  i dont like it at all she replied de-
cidedly dont you think romola
that its a reflection on the physicians
ability when they try to make you do all
the work of curing yourself

  tt does seem a little unfair agreed
romola smiling as she entered the
room

  its the only cure that amounts to
anything wade assured them follow-
ing her and i wont charge a cent
for that prescription

  the group about mrs keith was
breaking up the inveterate card players
to return to their game some of the
other men to make way for women
who crowded round to demand of deb-
orah where she had learned the art of
dancing whether she had always prac-


smiths magazine

ticed it whether she believed it might
be acquired after maturity what she
thought of it as an exercise and a dozen
other questions all tending toward the
same end

  no one was surprised when two days
later mrs ledyard the prime mover
in most of hazelwoods feminine en-
terprises made a round of visitations
and organized a fancy-dancing class
she pointed out quite truthfully that
hazelwood was behind some other en-
terprising suburbs in this respect and
that it was really a matter of com-
munal pride that it should take its place
in the list of fancy-dancing commun-
ities

  and half the feminine hearts among
the socially elect thrilled to a secret
hope that some night they might aston-
ish and delight their friends as deborah
keith had done at her dinner party

  romola did not join the class some-
thing had happened before-the close of
the memorable evening that made her
wish to put it forever out of her
thoughts with a sort of dull unjust
anger she had held her hostess respon-
sible for the experience that had con-
cluded the nights festivity for her

  after the dancing she had tried to in-
duce richard to go home he was not
playing cards for the stakes were
higher than he ever permitted himself
to play for richard was capable of a
certain dogged persistency that he him-
self was a little inclined to call virtue
but although he was not playing cards
he insisted upon waiting until the card
players were through he and keith
were to have a half hours conference
in regard to the new house it was
their only opportunity he explained to
romola for he was going west for a
week or so and he must have certain
instructions to leave with his drafts-
men

  romola had accepted the situation
rather ungraciously she wanted to get
away-away though she did not say it
even to herself from wade robinson
away from the sensuously stimulating
atmosphere of the room from the all-
pervasive dominating unruly influence
of deborah keith who still in her

dancing costume moved everywhere
among her guests

  florence graham and evangeline
had gone florence frankly yawning in
her liege lords face and saying well
send the car back for you but theres
no sense in our staying if youve settled
for an all-night at bridge

  romola had watched wade robin-
son take the two women to their au-
tomobile-she herself had come as far
as the piazza to bid her friends good
night and to make some neighborly en-
gagement for the next day she saw
him tuck the wraps about them there
wras something tender deferential in
everything that he did for women she
told herself flis attentions were not
the perfunctory sort with which mar-
riage had made her acquainted  she
stood waiting until he came back to the
porch

  sit down again for a while out
here he suggested its better than
the house the moon will be up in
about five minutes-see that paleness
over in the horizon thats where shes
climbing

  romola looked obediently to the east-
ern sky which along the distant hills
that bounded hazelwoods view
showed a silvery promise of light to
come she breathed the sweet night
odors of the old ferguson garden and
marked the delicate ghostlike beauty of
some pendulous late locust blossoms on
the trees along the road

  ill get you a scarf or shawl or
something said wade as she dropped
into a chair

  she smiled her thanks but said noth-
ing and he went through the door into
the murmurous lighted room beyond

  the night calm and beautiful the
slowly rising moon which silver-tipped
pushed itself above the brow of the hill
a sleepy twitter from a nest in the gar-
den-all soothed her into a forgetful
ness of her annoyance against richard
into a forgetfulness of the overstimu-
lated life in the house behind her

  she did not even wonder why doctor
robinson took so long a time to find her
a wrap afterward she told herself
that she must have closed her eyes that
the awakening of romola



she might even have lost herself for
a second certainly she heard no one
come up behind her but she was sud-
denly galvanized into consciousness of
her surroundings into startled action
for she felt upon her bare arm the
pressure of bearded lips

  she sprang to her feet to be con-
fronted by mayhew smiling offensive
at ease she opened her lips but suc-
ceeded only in stuttering mr-air

mayhew you-you-

  sit down again my dear mrs yent-
nor said mayhew suave and insolent
you made too charming a picture 
shall not forgive myself if my yielding
to a quite irresistible impulse should
cause you to destroy it shall i apolo-
gize i always yield to temptation
there was about his manner such ut-
ter effrontery such calm assumption
that any resentment of his outrage
would be merely a pretense that rom-
ola though furious was quite speech-
less before him her hazelwood train-
ing had given her no schooling in this
sort of thing occasionally a man who
had drunk more than was good for him
had confided to her his admiration of
her character or had attempted to tell
her why he was not entirely happy at
home but mayhew whatever else he
was was not intoxicated he had not
even that excuse for his insolence

  she fumbled for the handle of the
streen door and the great architect put
out his hand as if to seize hers upon
the knob and to prevent her leaving
but at that instant doctor robinson
scarf in hand appeared upon the other
side of the screen

  oh wade let me in find rich-
ard for me i want to go home i
must go home

  doctor robinson holding the door
open for her to pass looked out at the
other man standing in the semiobscurity
his eyes flashed an accusation his face
set in stern lines he was about to
close the door after romola and to re-
main outside when she turned

 will you come with me im not
well i had a-queer turn a sort of-
i dont know what

  wade did not believe her and the

look he turned upon mr mayhew told
that astute gentleman the fact but
there was nothing to do save to follow
where the lady commanded

  it seemed to her that she could not
endure another instant in the house
she was angry with herself for having
come her original instinct had been
right mrs keith was more than dis-
quieting more than upsetting her in-
fluence was disintegrating-depraving
a hostess might be measured romola
told herself by the way in which her
guests behaved in what other house
would even a satyr like that man have
dared to kiss her

  she felt scorched by the flame of her
indignation yet she was a mature
woman  she could not make a scene
she must find richard leave this house
and explain to him her reason for re-
fusing to enter it again let the keiths
get another architect if they were of-
fended  let them get mayhew let
them do anything except expect her to
have further intercourse with them

  richard and doctor cartwright en-
grossed neither in cards in the library
nor in ladies society in the parlor were
standing together in the big old-fash-
ioned hall that bisected the house rom-
ola and doctor robinson approached
them romolas white face the burn-
ing of her bright eyes the swiftness of
her light step all told of some experi-
ence momentous or unpleasant rich-
ard frowned a little as she came near
he feared that she was again about to
urge him to leave he stepped forward
to meet her in response to the summons
in her glance

  i must go now richard she said
her voice low and vibrant i-some-
thing has happened-t am feeling un-
well ytou must take me away from
here

  but ive already told you dear be-
gan richard complaininglv that ive
got to have a few words with keith
hes playing the rubber now its not
so late-only a little after one

  cant t run mrs ventnor home if
she is too tired to stay wade broke
in he looked kindly at her white
tense face she looks played out


smiths magazine

his eyes flashed an accusation his face set in stern lines

  richard brightened i should be
grateful to you-and so would she
its no taste for late hours that keeps
me here but im off for cleveland in
the morning and i must arrange a few
things with keith before i leave run
along romola-ill follow as soon as i
can we need a chauffeur-thats evi-
dent

  very well answered romola after
a moments rebellious silence thank
you wade its good of you

  she had recovered command of her-
self and while wade set the machinery
of the car in motion she made her brief

 adieus to
 deborah
 keith at
 whose side
 mayhew un-
 disturb-
 ed smiling
 was standing

  you must
forgive me
m r s  vent-
nor he said
boldly then
he turned to
h i s hostess
  m a k e my
peace w i t h
m r s  vent-
ii o r  mrs
keith he
begged im
in disgrace
ive showed
my admira-
tion too -
crudely
deborah
flashed an
i  q u i s i -
tive rather
pleased
glance from
his half-
amused face
to romolas
cold one
t hen she
laughed and
shrugged her
shoulders
you should have known better
mayhew she said-romola hated the
way she addressed her intimates with-
out title mrs ventnor is our saint-
our madonna you should have recog-
nized the type but you dear mrs
ventnor will have to forgive him
whatever he has done nobody minds
mayhew his gallantries mean noth-
ing personal-lie simply cant resist any
woman

 all ready called wade and rom-
ola escaped while the two whom she
left smiled at each other

 the risen moon-the sweet cool
the awakening of romola



dewy countryside-their benediction
fell upon her as she sank back in the
car she closed her hot eyes the night
calm was like dew upon them the
machine glided softly swiftly along
wade asked her no questions harassed
her with no comments but the sense
of his understanding wrapped her
about by and by he brought the car
to a standstill she opened her eyes
they were at her own doorstep

  thank you she sid as he helped
her out he held her hand and looked
down upon her with tender ardent eyes
she trembled and withdrew her hand
moving away from him

  i must go in she breathed hurried-
ly nervously it was good of you to
bring me home the pressure of his
fingers removed her courage returned
to her the feeling of haste for the
shelter of her home departed she
stood a moment watching the tranquil
night it is beautiful is it not she
said night-and moonlight-and
summer do you remember all that
you thought they meant when you were
young

 they mean all that they ever
meant he answered they mean
more they mean love

  harry grahams car en route for its
owner shot glaringly by under cover
of its noise romola uttered a hasty
good night and ran into the house her
heart was beating unevenly she hur-
ried to ralphs room the sight of his
delicate sleeping face stilled her agita-
tion she smoothed his soft pale-
brown hair and kissed him she was
calmed strengthened the evening at
the keiths over-colored over-noisy
ending in destined ugliness the mystic
disturbing poignantly sweet night and
the disquieting looks and words of her
old playfellow-all fell to their due un-
importance in the world

 it was only when richard came
home a trifle fussy about his prepa-
rations for his trip a trifle important
about his new commission that the
rasping of her nerves reasserted itself
briefly she told him of the incident with
mayhew he was annoyed but she
quickly saw that his annoyance was

really with her not with the man was
she sure oh mayhew had been
drinking too much-a beastly thing to
do of course but still it wasnt inex-
plicable  and if she was entranced-
half dozing he supposed she meant-on
the piazza why-

  to her indignation he seemed to in-
dicate that the fault was her own there
was in his manner the suggestion that
true womanly dignity knew how to
avoid such painful experiences-that
even womanly sophistication knew how
to avoid them although he called
mayhew a cad he rather inclined to
deborah keiths easy verdict-romola
would have to overlook the episode
and whereas deborah keith had lightly
given the impression that nobody
minded mayhew because he was neg-
ligible romolas husband seemed to in-
timate that nobody ought to mind may-
hew because he was great her disap-
pointment made her hotly unjust

  she would not quarrel would not
stoop to the wearisome bickering into
which she knew domestic explanation
so often degenerated but in her heart
she bitterly marveled at his dullness
did he not perceive that it was the
standing of their hostess her standards
the atmosphere that she created for her-
self that were declared stamped by
the incident occurring beneath her
roof

  there was disdain in romolas si-
lence but he did not feel it and for
that reason it grew it grew as she
listened to his opening and closing of
bureau and wardrobe drawers and
doors it grew as she answered his
questions concerning the weight of the
suits the colors of the ties that he
should carry with him it grew when
there was finally stillness in his dress-
ing room and the last trivial query had
been answered it grew as she lay
awake in the moonlit room until finally
the climbing globe of silver was level
with her windows and looked in upon
her

  then her tired thoughts drifted back
to the moment of farewell at the door
to the everlasting meaning and promise
of june nights again the trembling


smiths magazine

languor thrilled her she closed her
eyes and buried her face in her pillows
to shut out the ancient ever-young sor-
ceress who played thus upon her emo-
tions but the sorcery was in her own
veins and blinding herself to the moon
and the pale glorious night sky did not
still the uneven beating of her heart

chapter iv

  while richard was in cleveland
romola elected to play the part of the
recluse-the maternal recluse she
was much with her children and very
little with the rest of the world par-
ticularly she had decided to avoid wade
robinson even in her thoughts she
would not let her mind dweh upon the
emotion he aroused in her she shut
a door tightly upon a chamber in her
memory and declared stalwartly to her-
self that she had forgotten the moments
of agitation he had caused her that the
agitation did not exist she denied her
self to him when he called the next day
and that her servants might not com-
ment upon the particularity of the or
der she denied herself equally to all
of hazelwood

  and after the fashion of women who
have emotions to quell or sorrows to
forget she threw herself into unaccus-
tomed labor that her tired body might
help in the work of dulling her mind
such a period of unnecessary house
work as her admirably ordered house
knew during the next week was un-
precedented in the recollection of her
servants

  richards room had been done over-
that had been the task to which re-
morse had set her she had been bitter
and unjust in her thoughts of him that
last night when he was at home-she
would expiate the wrong now by serv-
ice  poor richard  how unkind she
had been in her reading of him-tired
hard-working conscientious sensible
uninspired man that he was

  she whipped her dormant gratitude
into life-see how much he did for her
and his children no home in hazel-
wood was better no woman in her set
had more servants or more efficient

ones the children went to the best
school would go to the best colleges
would have the best training that they
were capable of receiving pie liked
her to dress well-he had given her the
automobile good hard-working fel-
low 

  for all these things had meant work
-even the comfortable suburban-home
prizes of life did not come to dullards
or to laggards she told herself oh
if only he had had the gift to keep ro-
mance alive instead of all the comfort-
able serviceable gifts he had  but why
could she not bear with his little lacks
his little idiosyncrasies doubtless she
had trying traits of her own in fact
she knew she had-and she knew it all
the more she recalled because richard
never had any hesitation in reminding
her of them

  oh well that was richards waj-a
mans way-probably a much better
way than hers on which she prided her-
self-her way of keeping ugly lan-
guage recriminations spoken criti-
cisms out of their daily intercourse

  and so remorsefully penitently she
worked recalling everything she had
ever heard him say concerning his needs
and desires in his own domain and
carefully rearranging everything ac-
cording to them

  on the day when he was to have re-
turned a telegram came instead-he
had been detained for another week
a collapsing feeling like despair seized
her she could not fill another week
with manufactured artificial unheeded
work she could not fill every hour
with the children

  ralph and the twins were more inter-
ested in their own worlds already than
in the world they inhabited with their
mother their games their playmates
were all-engrossing to them rose the
bright-haired baby was learning too
to have a life of her own apart from
that with nurse dockerty the baby
next door was roses absorbing uni-
verse at present

  her demand of high heaven for an
occupation a distraction that should
keep down excitement the craving for
excitement and the memory of excite-
the awakening of romola



ment was not answered instead
evangeline dimock was on the tele-
phone ten minutes after richards tele-
gram

  may i come down ive lots to talk
to you about she announced gayly

  there was a tone in her voice that
sent a chill to romolas heart like the
one she had felt the night of the keiths
dinner when she had read the meaning
of evangelines radiant face

  do come  she answered im per-
ishing of loneliness the infants are all
out and richard wont be home for an-
other week

 richard away said evangeline
vaguely thereby incensing her unrea-
sonable friend i didnt remember-
you know weve all been away motor-
ing through the berkshires with the
keiths

  t didnt know responded romola
still more incensed

  ill be down and tell you all about
it said the girl and the matron
thought she detected a note of apology
in her voice

  evangelines shining handsome face
notified romola that wade robinson
had been of the party even before she
learned the list of the keiths guests
she transferred that unreasonable feel-
ing of anger to him then a fine way
she said to build up a practice she
said it aloud to evangeline cloaking
her resentment under a jest

  well he wasnt with us all the time
-neither he nor mr keith they
came up to lenox on friday and mo-
tored back with us it was heavenly -
theres no time like june is there and
the berkshires are perfect then

  romola agreed that the berkshires
were lovely in june

  who was of the party she asked

 oh harry flo mr mayhew the
pondexters and that amiable girl who
is visiting them and that bookish young
man-starr-who sat next to you at
the dinner we took mr mayhew up
with us and left him in stockbriclge
where he had an engagement and then
mr keith and doctor robinson came
up as i told you and motored back
with us

  we had three cars deborah keith
and harry and mayhew planned the
thing that night after the dinner flo
didnt want to go-you know shes a
lazy creature that sister of mine but
i took the bull by the horns and gave
her a hint about keeping up with harry
anyway she came at last

  how can you bear to go anywhere
with that keith woman demanded
romola impatiently shes-impos-
sible

  she isnt much like the rest of us
agreed evangeline cordially but per-
haps were rather narrow she inter-
ests me she never makes florences
mistake of taking her husband for
granted shes really mad about him
although she does flirt with other men

  she seems to me vulgar and
worse

  why romola you impractical
creature evangeline scoffed why
should you expect refinement and vir-
tue of your neighbors isnt it enough
if they give you amusement and ex-
citement an occasional thrill and make
no drafts upon your admiration and re-
spect at any rate you dont deny
that theyre waking hazelwood up-
the keiths are you going to join the
fancy-dancing class

  no answered romola shortly

  you dont need to of course
sighed evangeline looking with frank
envy at her friends slim figure its girl-
ish lines set off by her crisp white linen
morning dress still i imagine it will
be fun guess who is to teach it-once
a week 

  romola shook her head in token of
her inability to guess and evangeline
went on explosively and triumphantly
mrs keith herself that is after
september it isnt to begin really un-
til then

  what on earth began romola
what on earth does she want to do that
for 

  i think its very good-natured of
her she dances beautifully declared
evangeline

  she does indeed but why teach
why does she do it

  dont you think that shes really


smiths magazine

good-natured for all her-her-well i
suppose youd call it her commonness 
asked evangeline

  i really dont if you want me to an-
swer you truly declared romola
shes easy-going but that is a vastly
different thing from being good-na-
tured or kind-hearted but let us not
talk any more about her she makes
me ill-tempered in spite of myself
how do you like w ade robinson on
further acquaintance 

  there she had brought the words
out without any telltale break in her
voice she had an embroidery hoop
in her hands and some instinctive kind-
ness or instinctive dread of pain kept
her eyes upon it matching a thread to
a blossom while evangeline answered

  i-i like him very much said the
girl i wonder if he will really stay
here i dont think its a good place
for him do you 

  oh i dont know romolas man
ner was indifferent

  she raised her eyes now and thread-
ed her needle glancing naturally at the
girl as she did a soft flush was dying
slowly from evangelines round cheeks
there was a misty light in her eyes a
trembling softness about her mouth

  have you ever been west-i mean
to arizona or colorado or any of those
places 

  evangeline you infant cried ro-
mola with sudden sympathy rising and
crossing to kiss her friend do you
mean to tell me youre falling in love
with the man and are thinking of car-
rying him back where he ought to be

  romola

   romola  mimicked that lady
forcing herself to sisterly merriment in
spite of something tugging at her heart-
strings tell me all about it you dear
goose

  there is not a thing to tell-hon-
estly 

  romolas constricted heart went sud-
denly free again at the sincerity of
evangelines gaze and tone

  you mean that he hasnt knelt upon
his knees and begged you to be his
she was conscious that her jocosity was
out of character but to be jocose was

the only way she knew of not being sen-
timental plaintive even

  he hasnt said a word truly
only-he has such kind eyes-they look
at you so 

  she ended on a questioning inflection
romolas mind made affirmative answer
-he did have such kind eyes they
did look at one so but aloud she said
you see i shouldnt be so likely to
notice his eyes and the quality of his
glances

  he seems to understand one one
doesnt have to talk romola jealous-
ly remembered the silent infolding ten-
derness of that brief drive home she
was seated at her work again and care-
full found the point of the petal for
which she looked making no answer

  evangeline went on and yet he
seems impulsive-daring-oh i dont
know what you call it adventurous i
suppose yes-thats it hes an ad-
venturer at heart and-well the men
at hazelwood never seem to me par-
ticularly adventurous in their souls do
they to you 

  no they dont

  he isnt in our rut-i dare say that
is the secret of the-the attraction he
has for me evangeline pursued
blushing and bringing the words out
honestly i dont believe he cares a
cent about owning a larger house or a
newer model of car than his neighbor
i dont think hes-what would you call
it-smothered in-oh in things that
dont count-money clothes servants
country clubs and city clubs stakes at
bridge dinners not she added pon-
deringiy that hes averse to the good
material things of this world

  i think youve described him said
romola gently hes not an ascetic-
not that that is the secret of his unlike-
ness to our men i dare say richard is
a good deal more of an ascetic than
wade but hes adventurous-souled
thats it and he calls ones own soul
-that is yours-the heart that has not
had its adventure-to adventure too
evangeline she saw had not noticed
the revelation that her words had made
she breathed a sigh of relief not for
worlds not for worlds would she have
the awakening of romola



the girl guess that she too had heard
the bugle call of adventure sounding
down the dull prim paths of her exist-
ence and that the girl might not guess
the secret of her wavering wandering
half-fancy-so she named it to herself
-she must change the subject must
talk of other things other people she
led the conversation back to florence
and harry

  if only flo would indulge in the
hideous crime of jealousy sighed
flos sister temporarily diverted from
the theme of her own affections but
she doesnt she might be jealous of
you if you had a better-looking suit
next winter or if you got a french
car or went abroad when she couldnt
or were invited to visit at newport
shes capable of that trivial worthless
form of jealousy or envy or whatever
you call it but she never dreams of
being jealous of harry-she never will
until suddenly its too late

 then shell be jealous good and
plenty as harry himself might say
and shell cry and sob and look for-
lorn-and flo and i are such sights
when we are weepy and forlorn fat
women always are and shell call the
neighborhood to witness that shes been
a good wife and that she never looked
at a man after she turned her eyes away
from the clergyman who married her
to harry and shell ask the universe
why harry ever looked at another
woman-how it was possible for him
to poor flo 

  but he isnt looking at another wom-
an-in the sense you mean 

  the other woman isnt looking at
him if thats what you mean mrs
keith is crazy about her husband as we
all can see but she treats harry like
a man-not like a serviceable piece of
household furniture she doesnt treat
any man like that and thats why
theyre all half intoxicated with her
though she is as vulgar as you say she
is and though shes no better looking
than the rest of us and no more allur-
ing only-what lure she has she uses
flo and you and half the other women
have put yours away with your dresses
of the late nineties

  so thats how it seems to you

  thats the way it seems to me
evangeline pushed her thick wavy red
hair back with her large shapely white
hand i tell you my dear romola
there is a period of particular danger
to domestic peace i dont believe its
the first two years or whatever the time
of first adjustment may be love and
passion carry most married people tri-
umphantly through that but its years
later when the glamour has worn off
when the man has struck his gait in
business when the first financial pres-
sure is lifted when he isnt devoting all
his waking hours to the question of
whether or not he can support his fam-
ily its when he feels secure in his
business secure in his family-and ad-
venture calls to him just as-just as i
said a few minutes ago that it was the
possibility of adventure that called to
me in doctor robinson

  and so many wives never see that
period or its dangers they are set-
tled as they call it immersed in their
children-only foolish florence hasnt
even that excuse for being blind blind 
no if harry poor eager fat-heacled
thing-you know my dear brother-in-
law is a bit of a fathead romola-if
he escapes shipwreck it wont be due
to his stalwart principles-poor harry
who has indulged himself in everything
that he could afford all these years and
has not indulged in viciousness only be-
cause he hasnt happened to want to
if he escapes it will be neither his
own virtue nor flos merits that will
save him it will be just because deb-
orah keith has no earthly use for him
and throws him back to flo bruised
and sore and hurt for repairs and
-and maybe therell be other women
not so likely to do that

  romola looked at the girl with a
slow measuring thoughtful glance

  i see she said at last nodding her
head i see and do you suppose
that no marriages ever come to ship-
wreck because the situation is reversed
-because the husband has come to re-
gard the wife as a piece of domestic
furniture because she finds her hard
labor done her days idle her mind and


smiths magazine

heart vacant dont you think that
ever happens

  she spoke with an intensity that she
was half afraid evangeline would per-
ceive but the girl laughed

  not in hazelwood youre all
nice comfortable tabbies rom dear
well i must be oft will you ride
with me to-morrow  starritt has a
mare in his stable that is really worth
trying

  romola shook her head cant to-
morrow she said

  well come up for a game with us
to-night poor flo shes unhappy
without one gambling is her one pet
passion well i dare say even you
dear good tabbies have to have one

  be off with you cried romola
laughing

  evangeline laughed too and ran
down the steps and across the well-kept
lawn to the road

  i wonder if he cares for her was
the instant thought in the mind of the
woman whom she left behind it was
almost spoken aloud so promptly did
it follow upon the girls departure and
then fiercely what if he does cried
romola to herself

  she went into the hall she looked
in the box of the dark carved oak set-
tle for something but when she saw the
mass of caps and toys and gloves she
forgot what she sought she stood
staring frowning at the jumble for a
moment then a shadow darkened the
screen door leading to the piazza she
looked toward it suddenly like a
wave inundating her the sensation of
warmth peace and joy flowed over her
wade robinson stood looking in at her

  she went awkwardly to the door
opened it put out her hand mechani-
cally and said in a prim little voice
oh how do you do

  he did not answer only stood look-
ing at her out of deep-set feverishly
bright blue eyes then he drew a long
breath

  gad its good to be back he cried

  he sank into the chair that evange-
line had so lately quitted romola re-
sumed her own place

  ah yes she said vaguely you

have been away havent you  miss
dimock was telling me did you have
a pleasant trip

  the weather was excellent he an-
swered with a mock formality the
scenery i believe was beautiful i
know it is quite famed the company
was what you call jolly and -i
had as pleasant a trip as a man natural-
ly would have under such conditions-
provided that he was perishing of
thirst the pretense ar formality was
gone now his voice was earnest vi-
brant with feeling

 thirst romola repeated the
words dully

  of thirst he asseverated passion-
ately oh dont pretend to misunder-
stand me you know what thirst con-
sumed me-the desire to see you to
hear your voice to be near you

  her work fell from her lap and she
arose trembling pale

  you must not-you must not speak
to me like that she faltered

  but her gray eyes in spite of their
look of fright were shining like star
she knew and had not yet had time
to upbraid herself for knowing that she
was glad glad of what he said that
she was glad of the proof that he did
not care for evangeline glad of the
haggard adoring look he turned on her

  of course i mustnt speak to you
like this he answered roughly bitter-
ly i mustnt speak to you like this
because its the truth its been the
truth almost ever since the morning 
found you sitting by the roadside with
your hat in your lap-do you remem-
ber the harsh voice softened its
been the truth right along youll never
know what a mad temptation i had to
run off with - that night in the auto-
mobile when you leaned back looking
so white and tired in the moonlight
why romola  thinkt have loved you
ever since we were children together
but you forgot me for a good many
years confess didnt you

  romola was recovering her self-pos-
session some of the dizzy glad ex-
citement was dying out in her she
even forced a little smile as she put the
question to him
the awakening of romola



and all the evening as they sat on the porch and listened to the waves on the beach and
the band in the dining room she asked herself what she
should do with the empty summer

 oh ive been a man and a fool
like any other but that doesnt pre-
vent me from knowing the truth when
 feel it-the truth that i must not say
i can talk to you about all manner of
things in which neither of us is the
slightest interested-about books and
sunsets about the neighbors and the
weather and politics but i cant tell
you that i have been thirsting for you
as a famished man thirsts for a bub-
bling spring that he remembers and
yet what harm can it do you to hear

me i am not asking you to leave your
good husband and your children and
your home and to scandalize the neigh-
borhood im only relieving my heart
of a cry that it had to utter that can
do you no harm can it 

  it is not right said romola it
is not right you are saying things that
you could not say that i could not hear
if there were any one else present and
such things she ended firmly no
married woman should ever listen to
she was not altogether satisfied with


smiths magazine

the moral tone of her little lecture but
her agitation the singing joy that would
not be quiet in her heart made it im-
possible for her to speak more wisely

  an interesting rule for tete-a-tete
conversations thank heaven i am
not a married woman if she is never
to be permitted to hear anything more
interesting than may be said in front of
the gossips at the town pump confess
youre ashamed of that trite little-
minded rule

   am not declared romola but de-
lighting in his badinage all the good
rules in the world are trite all the safe
paths are the well-worn ones and
she added more seriously more sol-
emnly i am quite in earnest in what
i said you must not say anything to
me when we are alone that you would
not say-she blushed but brought the
words out valiantly-before my hus-
band or my children of course i
know theyre all nonsense-your
words you almost confessed to me the
first time i saw you in hazelwood that
you have been in the habit of making
harmless love but you must not to
me im a perfectly conventional per-
son t like my safe rules for conversa-
tion and behavior ill forget what you
have said to-day-her thrilling caress-
ing voice gave the lie to her steadfast
words her shining eyes denied them-
but you must never speak to me like
that again

  he stood up and came toward her
she looked at him bravely though her
heart was beating unevenly how
good looking he was-so ran some in-
dependent thought in her mind outside
the current of emotion-how tall how
pitifully thin itow the blue of his
deep-set overshadowed eyes shone out
in the tan of his skin 

  pity for him wasted by his long
light with illness surged in her min-
gling with that other delicious sensa-
tion that she could not admit to herself
-that sensation of weakness about to
be overmastered she took hold of the
back of the chair in front of her and
her fingers gripped hard upon the wood

  romola he said very seriously
tell me one thing and i promise you

not to speak again on the subject is
all this-this overpowering thing that
has happened-is it all on my side only 
has the wave swept over me alone and
left you standing dry shod

  she knew what she ought to do she
struggled for the reply that she ought
to make-the calm denial of any feeling
to match his own but her bosom rose
and fell her parted lips uttered no
word and her eyes starry pools of
light wavered and dropped before his
own

  ah  his exclamation of triumph
was whispered he stood before her
for a second before she raised her gaze
to meet his again

  i have said nothing she protested
the sound of her own voice gave her
strength to go on restored her to the
everyday world in which one spoke
clearly knew ones mind had princi-
ples standards convictions of right and
wrong i will not be questioned i
have given you no right to dare speak
so to me

  your eyes are not conventional
hypocrites whatever your words may
be he told her but dont be afraid
i shall not presume on-on anything
but oh romola to think that a wom-
an like you-to think that you your-
self-might have loved me  it is enough
for me to live on

  lie avas gone at once he gave no
backward look toward the figure stand-
ing still behind the chair with fingers
still clutching it she stood there a
long time gradually the singing in her
heart the tumult in her brain quieted
she saw things as they were according
to the hazelwood tradition according
to the best traditions of her own life

  here was she a married woman with
the most devoted of husbands the most
adorable of children the most delicate
of tastes-here was she letting a man
make love to her she who had al-
ways prided herself on her austere
standards she whom all her little
world believed to be so cold and proud
she in whom the heart of her husband
trusted utterly

  she had a vision of a dark mocking
face that derided her of a flutelike
the awakening of romola



jeering voice that demanded of her
where were now her fine feelings she
imagined deborah keiths unholy
mirth had she been privileged to over-
hear the conversation just finished

 she walked back into the house and
upstairs to the telephone on the second
floor she busied herself for a few
minutes with the directory then for
half an hour railroad stations and sum-
mer resorts near by answered her
queries

 when nurse dockerty came in rose
clinging to her hand ralph and lucy
dancing behind her romola announced 
im glad youve come in nurse ive
just been telephoning to mereside mr
ventnor will not be home for a week
and i think well all go down there to
spend it the children need a change

 the two older children burst into a
protest sallys birthday party was
next thursday-didnt she remember
oh mother couldnt they stay for that 
there was going to be a clown they
didnt like old mereside anyway oh
mother mother even rose who on
account of her tender years was not
invited to sallys party raised her voice
in sympathy with her brethren

 but mother was obdurate in spite
of nurse dockertys declaration that
the children did not have half enough
clean clothes to go anywhere away
from home in spite of her recollection
of ralphs appointment with the dentist
on wednesday and her conviction that
it would be cold and damp at the seaside
since-nurse dockerty was rather em-
phatic in calling romolas attention to
this-since it was remarkably cool for
the time of year even in hazelwood in
spite of everything that could be urged
against it romola persisted in her plan

 the afternoon train to mereside saw
them all in it some of them with the
marks of rebellious tears still on their
cheeks a telegram to richard ap-
prised him of their changed address

 when they were safely out of hazel-
wood and the train was speeding to-
ward the sandy jersey shore romola
leaned back in her chair and breathed
a great sigh of relief she had not had
time for consideration from the mo-

ment she had left the porch she had
been hurrying as if pursuers were on
her track now in the lull of activity
she found that the thing she fled was
with her on the train was with her in
herself it was not wade robinson
whom she had feared  he could threaten
her with no danger  he could force her
to listen to no words she did not wish
to hear no the enemy the peril was
in her own heart

  nevertheless she told herself as the
train rushed through the forests of
scrub oak and pine and the flat stretches
of sand she had done well to run away
at any rate those traitors in her heart
should have no opportunity to surren-
der the citadel to the foe outside

  at the end of the week richard came
down he had been to hazelwood first
and his errand at mereside was the
usual paternal one-he would spend
sunday and bring the family up with
him on monday morning romola and
the four children met him at the train
all of them browner and rosier for the
week on the hot sands

  sallys party had been forgotten-
lucy and ralph her contemporaries
swarmed upon their father with bub-
bling tales of the thousand distractions
that had driven sally from their minds
rose shrilled and screamed her delight
according to her noisy wont ralph
more gentle more restrained waited
with his wide little old-fashioned
smile for the more youthful greetings
to be over romola large-eyed smil-
ing stood behind them all with all
her heart she had been hoping for a
miracle hoping that she might see once
more in richard the lover of her girl-
hood the dear joyous companion of
her early married clays

  there there kids he kissed his
brood and pushed them from him ten-
derly enough he looked inquiringly at
romola

  youre all looking very fit it seems
to me he said in a half-injured voice
why on earth did you run away from
home like that romola 

  she blushed and answered vaguely
oh i dont know i thought the
change would do the children good


smiths magazine

and it was dull at home-lonely i
couldnt stay there alone any longer

  richard looked at her in some alarm
was it possible that his well-balanced
wife was becoming erratic notional

  i dont see why you should have
been lonely with a whole townful of
friends and neighbors about you he
objected

  i suppose i missed you replied
romola

  as though i hadnt been away twice
as long a dozen times however i
dont want to find fault although we
are sailing pretty close to the wind and
a tribe like ours cant put up at mere-
side for nothing never mind though
youre here and well try to enjoy it

  so it had begun again the old fa-
miliar process of closing her lips firm-
ly upon criticisms that she would like
to make in her turn romola walking
ahead with eyes fixed on the blue of
the sea was conscious that the unruli-
ness of spirit the rebelliousness of
heart that she had been fighting the
whole week had returned to her with
her husbands appearance

  she asked him something about his
cleveland trip and he began talking of
it it all sounded dull and sordid the
complaints of train service of hotel
service-he hadnt had a decent cup of
coffee since he left home it seemed
and this was a grievance overshadow-
ing even the business that took him to
cleveland the committee he had gone
to confer with were all distasteful to
him-ignoramuses who insisted upon
making themselves heard in spite of
their limitations he doubted whether
he had gained anything for himself by
the trip

  did you see any one at home last
night asked romola

  yes i went over to keiths i
wanted to see him he wasnt at home
but there was a crowd there playing
cards smoking and drinking that
woman must have the constitution of
an iron horse-she never seems to go
to bed shes always smoking and at
least half the time shes drinking and
ret shes always vigorous and alive
its a great thing to have an organiza-

tion like that graham was there of
course so was florence looking rather
seedy i thought

  they turned in toward the hotel
people  the piazza watching them
approach smiled at the family picture
the pretty well-dressed children run-
ning ahead the slim lovely young-
looking wife and mother the good
substantial-even a little bit stolid-
husband and father provider for the
group proprietor of it as they swung
through the door into the hall richard
added to his budget of home gossip

  oh by the way graham tells me
theres going to be a match between
evangeline and that doctor friend of
you rs-robinson

 what

  the exclamation came without r-
olas volition she stood transfixed
between the door and the desk to which
richard was making he looked back
at her half surprised half amused at
the effect of his announcement

  evengeline and robinson he re-
peated are you surprised im not
-eves been ripe for matrimony any
time these five years romola stiff-
ened at what seemed to her his coarse-
ness i should think though he went
 easily she might have done better
for herself than to take up with rob-
inson

  why  romola asked mechanically
she had followed richard to the desk
and stood beside him while he auto-
matically signed the register

  oh nothing very serious i sup-
pose replied richard turning away
from the desk only shes such a
fine strapping healthy woman its a
pity she ties up to a semi-invalid and
i dont believe liell stick it out there
in hazelwood i doubt if liell be able
to dont believe the climate will let
him besides he strikes me as some-
thing of a philanderer dont know
why for i havent known him long
enough to tell but thats the way he im-
presses me doesnt he you

  so that was the way wade impressed
her husband impressed the ordinary
casual commonplace shrewd observer
and wade was engaged to evangeline
the awakening of romola



dimock why it was not a week since
his eyes had burned into hers with their
ardent message since his words and his
voice had played upon her very heart-
strings  a philanderer and she-
what was she but an unsophisticated
fool as ignorant for all her years and
the children playing ahead of her and
the man walking by her side as any
schoolgirl but was richard sure

 is it really an engagement an-
nounced and all  or something that
harry merely surmises she was
surprised at the tranquillity of her own
voice

  i dont know that its announced
replied richard yawning harry
merely gave me the impression it was
settled its a wonder evangeline never
gave you any hint of it shes such a
follower of yours

  i dare say it reached a climax sud-
denly if it is true romola answered
with the same serenity i did think
she rather liked him but one can never
tell i am quite sure it wasnt settled
the last time i saw her the morning i
left home she spoke of him and there
was no mistaking her manner-very
much interested but quite uncertain of
him

  she shut a door inside her heart upon
a room where side by side with the
recollection of her last talk with evan-
geline lived the memory of the last talk
with wade false-weak-a common
trifler-what was it that he was had
they all been part of a familiar pose-
the eager eyes the happy voice the
words the atmosphere in which he
enveloped her

  in a curious stillness of the mind she
put the questions without anger with-
out shame without any of the emo-
tions that she supposed a woman-
scorned played with-ought to feel

  im numb she realized with a lit-
tle start its because the blow dead-
ened me that i feel it so little

  and then she thought of evangeline
and wade and then of the going on
of her own life tt was not wade

whom she regretted she saw suddenly
it was something more dear than any
man-the possibility of romance the
possibility of rapture it was not
wades departure not even the manner
of it that would by and by after the
strange numbness had passed cause her
hot anger and tingling shame that
would till her life with loneliness it
yvas the final passing of the glory of
youth before youth itself had gone

  romola said richard anxiously
breaking in upon her musing do you
knowr i think we shall have to have
ralphs adenoids attended to in the
fall  the boy positively snuffles 

  she came back to the world wrhere
she belonged with a jerk moonlight
and the amethystine glamour were over
for her her husbands dinners her
childrens colds in the head-it was
with these that she must concern her-
self

  why wait until the fall wouldnt
it be better to have it done now while
he is out of school 

  there wont be time now-perhaps
later when he comes back from camp
oh i didnt tell you-ive arranged for
that camp on lake cayuga i ran
down there on my way from cleveland
a fine fellow the man at the head of
it-clean straight i liked him a lot
hell knock the mollycoddle out of
ralph in no time

  hes never been away from me since
he was born she said softly but
there was no pleading in her voice she
knew richard by this time and the
persistency that was so large a factor
in his success

  and all the evening as they sat on
the porch and listened to the waves 
the beach and the band in the dining
room-transformed on saturday nights
into a ballroom-she asked herself what
she should do with the empty summer
not until then did she realize that in
spite of her high intentions and fine
words she had unconsciously counted
upon a continuance of the excitement of
wades love-making

to he continued
imustkated uv iiaroll thomas denison

ive been thinking maybe we better
go live a while at letties

     they had just come up from din-
ner gropingly grandmother had found
her chair close by the window and
grandfather had dropped his crutch to
the floor and substituted for it the ear
trumpet through which came to grand-
mother all that she heard of the fading
world

  we better go to letties mother
he said again

 why were comfortable here
david stellas good to us we dont
lack for anything and you know

  were getting old david-you forget
that

  seems as though were in the way
here elizabeth i think our room was
the spare room stella doesnt have
company the way she did when we first
came dont you remember the stylish

rich folks-

  well david you never cared for
company and were not much for
style

  there was a bitter note in the old
mans voice as he answered no-
thats it were not stylish

he looked swiftly at the face beside
the golden bowl



him elizabeth had been beautiful a
half century before-beautiful for
many many years afterward it had
been soon after they had come to their
daughter stellas house that mother
had awakened one morning to find her-
self unable to speak to david or lift
her hand to lay it over his alone one
day after a months illness she had got
up and tottered to the mirror had seen
her face with one side drawn and with-
ered had seen her helpless arm she
had got back her speech but without
her trumpet all she could hear was
little miss ames practicing her choir
music in the next house for grand-
mother too were slowly dropping the
curtains over the darkened windows of
old age

  grandfather bishop always sensi-
tive felt elizabeths loss as one feels
a never-healing wound growing accus-
tomed to it but aware at times of un-
speakable pain during their slow un-
even walk in the afternoon he was al-
ways tortured yet for her sake by the
curious glances of passers-by some-
times at sight of the old people with
their failing senses their crutch and
their ear trumpet the young smiled as
they hurried by in the pride and flush
of strength

 grandfathers was the occasional
overkeen hearing of the old a whis-
per at dinner between stella and her
husband a syllable half formed like a
cryptic sign he heard everything and
everything hurt

  we might go to letties in the fall
he said into the trumpet and maybe to
georges in another spring he
sighed but grandmother could not hear
sighs through her trumpet i wish i
hadnt given that money to build a li-
brary  i wish i had saved it till now
and had it to give the children and
then we wouldnt feel-like a burden

  there there david its done we
cant help it now we didnt know wed
lose the rest later she felt blindly
for his hand

  the family were coming into the li-
brary from the porch-stella her hus-
band and little donald grandfather
put away the trumpet tenderly he

  laid about grandmothers shoulders the
purple shawl lettie had sent for christ-
mas and then they sat in silence as the
summer evening deepened-the silence
of those for whom the world is grow-
ing dark

  feeling themselves useless a burden
old-fashioned behind the times their
opinions worthless their thoughts lin-
gered for a little time over the advis-
ability of leaving stellas house and
being taken care of by lettie then
with the merciful toxin of age they
were back in other years and youth-
all youth-was theirs the white
clematis that grew to their window
ledge was the bloom of a summer night
long ago the evening song piercing
sweet of a bird swaying on a perfumed
bough was the bird that heard his first
i love you voices of little children
playing in the twilight street were the
voices of their own boys and girls un-
speakably loved

  stella was coming upstairs with don-
ald leading the child she went softly
by the door she did not stop or look
in bone was she of their bone flesh
of their flesh out of their youth had
been distilled her beauty and her pride
if for a fleeting instant they craved the
touch of her-a word-why they must
not complain she was a woman now
mother of another generation they
had had their day now they were old
crippled useless

  stella read to donald every night
from a book about big americans for
little americans and after he had
undressed himself-as was evidenced
to grandfathers keen ears by the fall-
ing of his shoes the rattling of elastics
and the scrape of buttons on a chair
back by stellas oh donald hang it
up you know you are going to be
an orderly man and the boys
wheres my night drawers-the
story reading began

  her clear firm voice read on about
the man lincoln it was slow work
for donald was full of whys-his fa-
ther said that his why factory never
shut down stella read that every one
honors the memory of lincoln

  whats that honor anyway  de-

imp mm jmsm 

whats that honor anyway demanded donald

mantled donald and it was evident
from a certain creaking that he was
sitting up in bed to get the informa-
tion  n first grade we say one-
like that like an explosion one i
-love-my-country two i honor
flag-

   i honor her flag  corrected
stella

  all right-two hers but what does
the thing mean

  honor all was silent a moment
for when you come to think of it
honor isnt so easy a thing to put into
a sentence grandfather waited to
hear he was always glad for some-
thing to pass on afterward to grand-
mother through the trumpet-some
quaint wit of donalds another proof
of stellas competence a clever saying
of edwards so small a thing inter-
ests the very old tt takes so very little
the golden bowl	

to make them happy listening he
stroked grandmothers withered hand
that felt almost nothing any more save
his touch

  honor said stella why honor
is something more than love its a
way you feel-well its the way we feel
about grandfather we love him and
at the same time we look up to him
for what he knows-and the great man
he is what he thinks about a thing
just about settles it for your father
you know well thats the way people
feel about lincoln lets read now
lincoln was a
man whose gener-
osity- 

  whats genros-
ity 

  its being will-
ing to give don-
ald lincoln gave
his time his love
days nights
everything to make
the black people
free there are so
many ways to give

when i was a lit-
tle girl i was al-
ways sick and my
mother took care
of me that meant
a good deal in
those days there
werent so many
doctors and nurses
as there are now

mothers took care
of their children

that meant that
mother gave to me
-herself that
kind of giving like
lincolns you
cant see

  and you know

ive told you how
your grandfather
gave m o n e y to
found a library-
yes like the one 
second street yes
a little bigger you
see that will be

there when were gone always grand-
father will live  in all the things he
has done and arent we glad he gave
the money for something that will last
that is the best way to give your
grandfather was a great man-and he
is yet you see thats the wonderful
thing about being good  it doesnt stop
the body gets old of course but all the
good things grandfather and grand-
mother have done will keep going on
and on and they will never be forgot-
ten

  like lincoln

grandmother could not hear but stellas head was on her breast stellas tears
on her withered hand


smiths magazine

like lincoln now lets read the

beauty of lincoln-

i dont think lincolns beautiful 
think hes homely weve got a picture

n first grade-

  oh but beauty donald is some-
thing more than a picture can show
you cant see all there is of beauty with
your eyes you know dear who i
think is the most beautiful person in all
the world 

  who 

  my mother

  grandmother

your grandmother-yes dear
when i think of her-and grandfather

and their lives-i- lets begin here

to-morrow night my throat- couldnt

read any more darling-

  a long silence through the house no
sound in all the night save the clematis
blowing in the wind and one bird cry-
ing you wont call out dear we-
must be quiet on account of them

  is that w-hy jaky and us cant play
engine in the dining room an more
yes we must have the house quiet
-the rest of the time

  but you like company we always
used to have it

  yes but it isnt good for them and
were so happy to have things just right
for them there now draw the cover
up youre going to be a great fine
man like grandfather

  a prayer was said a light was put
out shades were lowered steps came
cautiously along the hall stella stopped
at the door her strong fine head erect

  i thought you were asleep she
said in her reserved even voice at
a touch on the arm grandmother
turned too to see stella in the door
so small a thing helps fill the lagging
hours of the old i thought you were
asleep-you were so quiet is there
anything i can do for you  it was

an accustomed question but this time
stella lingered drawing her hand
across her eyes isnt there anything
i can do for you

   out of the fragrant twilight came the
voice of the chorist singing the song of
old age

   or ever the silver cord be loosed
   or the golden bowl be broken-

  with a half-smothered cry stella
crossed the room and sank dowm at
their feet oh  she sobbed oh 
there now soothed grandmother
there now you go off somewhere
with edward weell take care of don-
ald fatherll hear everything youve
got too much to do-youre all tired
out were a lot of care stella

  no no not that oh mother

i cant bear it -

   when you wrere a little girl grand- 
father said- we used to think how
beautiful ou were and once when
you were sick we watched all night-
it was a summer night like this-and

we were afraid wed lose you-

  and now and now father-mother
-oh when i think of it-all the years
and years you took care of me and
how theres nothing at all i can do to

pay you back- she lifted her wet

face to theirs youre happy here
youre contented you wont-oh
you wont leave me

  well stay here stella what time
is left you are a dear daughter
stella

  grandmother could not hear but
stellas head was on her breast as it
had been forty years before stellas
tears were on her withered hand they
three clung to each other in speechless
yearning as the young voice sang in the
growing night

  his wager communicated straight-
way to a committee of delta gamma
phis outside was accepted with undis-
guised hilarity

  when toward morning deceived by
a long period of silence price made a
determined onslaught on the door his
efforts were greeted by derisive jeers
from the watchers in the hall and the
cheerful information was vouchsafed
him that a barricade of furniture
awaited his assault when he should have
succeeded in removing the intervening
obstacle thereto whereat he aban-
doned his initial scheme of escape as
impractical

  all about him were piles of discarded
books stacks of dingy manuscripts
worn flags and banners odd garments
maps dusty globes and other useless
paraphernalia what he needed des-
perately in furtherance of the scheme
now germinating in his brain was
something in the line of suitable attire
in sky-blue pajamas-the only clothing
his captors had permitted him-and
with bare feet a man is not exactly
equipped for public scrutiny even in a
sprinting match the only outfit avail-
able in the storeroom was one that at
first he absolutely refused to consider
afterward when the situation grew
wearily worse he recognized that bad
as the alternative was it at least went
the pajamas one better and dragged
the bundle down from the high shelf
on which it reposed

  presently the cracked mirror in the
dim light of a single plugged gas jet re-
vealed his figure clothed in grotesque
prison stripes the garments had once
been used in college dramatics and he
thanked his stars that they hung loosely
on his muscular frame

 when the morning was well ad-
vanced he cautiously opened the dusty
and stubborn window of the storeroom
in preparation for a circuslike leap
through space into the boughs of an
elm tree below he knew that an at-
tempt so foolhardy had not even en-
tered the minds of his captors and that
there should be nothing to interfere
with his flight when once he set foot
on the college campus

  for a wavering moment as he meas-
ured the intervening space he consid-
ered the possible aftermath of broken
bones resulting from such an attempt
and was moved to abandon his plan
the next instant he was more deter-
mined than ever to carry it out had
he not passed through numberless
games of football unscathed and had
not the danger of injury only added
zest to the sport there was nothing
more to be done in the way of pre-
liminaries except to wait for the disap-
pearance of an obstacle that had sud-
denly and exasperatingly presented it-
self immediately beneath the boughs of
the chosen elm wtaiting was the last
thing price found himself willing to do

 confound you-get awav from
there  why of all times should you
settle on this particular morning to in-
vestigate the ravages of those elm-tree
beetles you bespectacled bug

  the bespectacled bug thus inaudibly
addressed was a sophomore of scien-
tific proclivities and one much inter-
ested in the study of forestry he said
afterward that not being a fraternity
man himself he would never have
thought to betray the fleeing student to
those interested if that malefactor had
not landed ruthlessly upon his unsus-
pecting shoulders along with part of a
bough that he had broken in his descent
even that indignity he might have over-
looked had price not added to it by de-
manding the loan of his russet shoes
following up the demand by a speedy
and enforced removal of same

  five minutes after the vandal act had
been committed the delta gamma phis
were informed of harper prices exit
from storage by elm tree and the direc-
tion in which he had fled was pointed
out to them

  oldport avenue was oldports finest
residential street it had never looked
more attractive than on this particular
day in early october the well-spaced
maples on either side formed great suc-
cessive torches of blazing yellow seem-
ing to call for nothing less than a cere-
monial procession to pass in pomp along
the bordered road
a wagecr won



  but the incongruous is always intrud-
ing to devastate the poetry of things
and instead of a stately cavalcade with
gorgeous trappings there appeared a
single prosaic taxicab which slid unim-
pressively along until about midway of
the block when it sidled close to the
pavement and stopped

  a fashionably clad young girl pushed
open the door and breaking into ex-
pectant dimples sprang lightly to the
ground between her and the house
toward which she looked lay a well-kept
lawn divided into two exact squares of
green the residence itself though
handsome bore an almost oppressive
air of conscious and rigorous respecta-
bility seeing that the shades were
drawn an expression of dismay ban-
ished the smile from the girls fresh
young countenance

  dear me the place looks as deserted
as a desert she cried turning to the
driver she handed him some silver
im afraid theres no one at home
the man saluted

  theres some one now he said for
at that instant around a corner of the
house jolted the stout form of a gayly
clad woman evidently a domestic she
was entirely engrossed in pulling an
emaciated white glove onto a pudgy
right hand and did not see the new-
comer until she fairly ran into her

  goodness me  she gasped it isnt
you miss rose

  who else you dont sound enthu-
siastic dont you think im good to
look at katie

  the stout woman removed the glove
and exercised her stiffened fingers

  youre better to look at than ever
miss rose but you took my breath
away for a minute its a piece of luck
i remembered t must feed the cat the
first time i started out or thered have
been no one here to let you in
why wheres aunt julia

  already kate had turned back and
while she fumbled for a key led the
way to the front door

 in new york with your uncle
james

  how long has she been away

  for a week past and not a soul on
the place but me

  you dont really mean that the folks
arent here for me to surprise

  i do that miss rose

 how horrid of them-when i
thought it would be such fun

  ill make you as comfortable as i
can till they get back involuntarily
she sighed you must have a cup of
tea right now

  cup of tea eh and you in white
gloves and sunday-go-to-meeting hat
youre on your way to nothing less than
a wedding or a christening you dont
need to think that im going to inter-
fere

 but what can you do here all
alone

  make some tea and entertain my-
self reading this noon extra  bought
down at the station

  but kate still demurred though tug-
ging hopefully at her glove

 you know how particular your
aunt julia is she wouldnt like your
being left here all alone

  hows aunt julia to know anything
about it if no one tells her

  the young girl thrust her hands into
the pockets of her long natty coat and
put up a defiant little chin she was
above the average height and her mili-
tary turban with its upstanding cock-
ade made her appear taller yet her
slim feet were as usual incased in
shoes with perilously high heels and the
return kate took in the general effect
of her with awed admiration she made
up her mind tocopy that turban as
soon as the visitors stay was ended

  i wont be back later than live
oclock she said ushering her into the
wide hall and its awful kind of you
to be willing to get along without me
why shouldnt i when theres the
cat and the canary for company also
my better self which i am told one
should associate with frequently you
mustnt think of me as being left alone
at all go right along now katie
to tell the truth i should hate to
miss witnessing hattie mcmanus get-
ting married seeing that shes had two
men back out at the last minute that

the fugitive panting the perspiration dripping from his countenance stood facing her his back

against the door

was promised to her this is the third
and i hope hell stick

  what a well-ordered home it was
as miss raymond laid off her hat and
coat she saw that everything was kept
up to the same degree of spick-and-span
neatness as always since her earliest
visits as a child there was not a dried
leaf on the spreading plants in the bulg-
ing hall windows with their plate glass
polished to rainbow luminosity there
was not a tarnished wire in the bright
cage of the fat and flawless canary bird
that occupied it

  perhaps it was because her beloved
aunt julia and dear uncle james were
as unchangeably irreproachable a their
surroundings that she invariably found
the visits she paid them a trifle mo-
notonous unconventional happenings
however interesting simply could not
occur in such a model and methodical
home how she longed for something
out of the ordinary to stir the untrou-
bled calm of the stream of her daily
life  yet even the pleasure of taking

her relatives by surprise had been
denied her

  she raised the sitting-room windows
kate had already left the front door
ajar at her request and as the glorious
october air swept in to banish the mus-
tiness of the inner atmosphere her
spirits resumed their usual happy alti-
tude she indulged in a gay little
snatch of song as she tripped toward
the big closet at the end of the hall in
the identical spot where a shawl of
some description had always reposed
since memory served her she found a
billowy pink one to throw about her
shoulders

  returning to the sitting room she set
the samovar going and sank down with
the noon extra of the oldport herald
in her lap her blond head gracefully
outlined against the back of a huge and
formal chair

  oldport was an old-fashioned resi-
dence town but it boasted mildly of
three things in the way of seeable at-
tractions first there was the oldport
a wager won



college then there was a carnegie li-
brary and last on the list oldport
penitentiary miss raymond had often
viewed the prison which stood in gray
and picturesque ugliness on the banks
of oldport river and had once sug-
gested visiting the institution but this
her aunt julia had forbidden

  the familiar outlines of the building
were staring at her now from the front
page of the noon extra and beneath it
was an account of the sensational es-
cape of a young convict from its en-
virons the night before-one jackson
elderwein lately sentenced to a term of
years for manslaughter lie was pow-
erfully built the article went on to say
with dark hair and eyes thick-lipped
beetle-browed a trpical criminal des-
perate and dangerous at the foot of
the column appeared an announcement
in extra black lettering

  elderwein is supposed to be at large now
in oldport or immediate vicinity a liberal
reward is offered for his detection and cap-
ture

  miss raymond shivered slightly and
got up to close the windows just to
think of it-a convict rambling around
unfettered right here in respectable
conservative oldport a man guilty of
the next thing to murder after all it
wasnt so very pleasant to find ones
self entirely alone in a big house like
this-a house containing all sorts of
odd corners where a thick-lipped
beetle-browed criminal might conceal
himself quite easily if he took it into his
head to do so

  oh  she gasped and flung the pa-
per aside in nervous fear then she
laughed the plump canary had jog-
gled the fishbone to the floor of his
cage that was all but it had sounded
like a mysterious and forbidding knock
at the door why wras it she wondered
that one always heard mysterious and
forbidding noises when no one was
around that were never by any possi-
bility heard at any other time

  feeling the need of company she
stooped and stroked brewster the cat
but he was curled into a living hassock
in front of the fireplace and sleepily

ignored her advances she chirped to
the canary hoping to inveigle him into
a responsive twitter but for the present
he was interested in fishbone only then
the bright shelter of the open attracted
her and she stepped out onto the ve-
randa

  faint shouts reached her from a dis-
tance college boys perhaps practic-
ing some game on the campus she
thought idly crossing a yawn with
two dainty fingers she wondered if she
should accept her student cousins in-
vitation to a college dance the follow-
ing saturday evening

  suddenly the cries grew louder as if
their clamor had been swelled by fresh
voices and additional excitement also
they seemed strangely near all at
once as if seeking to escape those cries
a man clothed in prison stripes half
bent over his elbows drawn in close to
his sides made a tumultuous entrance
into the quiet street running at topmost
speed  elderwein in oldport avenue 
her premonition had become a fact

  as she turned and fled blindly into
the hall she collided squarely with a
large rubber plant upsetting it and fall-
ing with it in dire confusion on the pol-
ished floor even while striving to ex-
tricate one of her high heels from the
tangle of a torn skirt braid the tears
starting to her eyes from the pain of a
badly bumped nose it still seemed to
her that she could hear the clatter of
those flying feet

  then the great door behind her
slammed shut apparently of its own
accord with a startled exclamation
she sprang up the fugitive panting
the perspiration dripping from his coun-
tenance stood facing her his back
against the door

  she heard herself giving a series of
short staccato shrieks that seemed to
stop of their own accord as the inter-
loper put up a protesting hand

  dont-do that-again-please he
panted youre-in no-danger-and
you might-arouse-the neighbor-
hood

  miss raymond did not do it again
she found to her amazement that she
had no inclination to repeat the per-


smiths magazine

formance she was not nearly so ter-
rified from the actual encounter as she
had been at sight of the creature at a
distance she could hardly realize save
for the irrefutable proof of his attire
that she was in the presence of a des-
perate character at all he looked quite
as respectable as many young men of
her acquaintance and even more so
than some also he was unreasonably
good looking and instead of glaring at
her with murderous ferocity as by all
laws of precedent in such cases he
should have done he displayed some
splendid teeth in a singularly winning
smile

  deep in her inmost soul miss ray-
mond was intensely and imaginatively
romantic and she now experienced the
delicious conviction that-face to face
with a criminal alone and in his power
-she was undoubtedly experiencing the
most thrilling moment of her life she
found herself rising to the superb
heights of courage that the situation
seemed to require

  i suppose you think you frightened
me dreadfully she said with preter-
natural quietude forgetting her outcry
of a moment before but you didnt i
know who you are and i am as calm as
possible

  calm  panted he of the striped at-
tire regarding her with an approving
right eye while he applied an alert left
ear to the crack of the door i wish
-i could say-as much-for my-
state of mind-but i cant

  his breath was coming painfully and
miss raymond wondered how far he
had run since his pursuers began the
chase evidently persuaded that he was
safe for the moment the fugitive
straightened to his full height and ad-
dressed her pantingly still

  of course-its inexcusable-dash-
ing in here like this-you know i-
hid-in a bakeshop kitchen-an hour-
but-it got so hot-behind the oven-
and-these clothes too-please excuse
the robbed me of everything-but my
blue paj-i mean-if i could have
found a-better-disguise-but i
couldnt when a fellow-knows-his
escape is discovered-and has made a

big wager-the others cant nab him

very-

  he must naturally find refuge
where and how he can miss ray-
mond obligingly completed the suspend-
ed sentence and nodded her compre-
hension though coldly of course
that is the way any one in your unfor-
tunate position would be obliged to look
at it

  with deliberate dignity she stooped
to right the rubber plant which still lay
in unseemly disorder upon the immacu-
late floor

 allow me her strange guest
bounded forward and tipped the tub
into equilibrium again flinging back
into it a spilled clod or two then
dusting his hands on his hideous trou-
sers he went on with his narrative evi-
dently taking her continued interest for
granted

  i had a scrimmage with one fellow
-on the campus-and knew hed turn
informer-before i was out of sight

 you dared cross the campus
wasnt that hazardous for a-person-
in your situation

  if id been able to reach the street
an other way id have avoided it
he admitted but not owning an aero-
plane  was obliged to do the best i
could they lost the trail while i was

in the bakeshop-

 sh she interrupted whats
that 

  once more he bent to listen

  its only a fishmonger she in-
formed him after an expectant moment
of silence i thought it was some one
after you

  i think ive dodged them all right
said he though once the whole pack
were at my heels yelling themselves
black in the face

  he laughed as he spoke almost as if
he found eluding his pursuers a merry
sport miss raymond could but ad-
mire his insouciant intrepidity though
instantly ashamed of herself for doing
so

  awfully kind of you to overlook
my -butting in here as i did he said
gratefully ill reconnoiter a moment
and be on my way if the coast seems
a wager won



clear they may be doing the stealthy
act just to fool me of course but i
rather think im safe

  he placed his hand  the doorknob
dont go-just yet miss raymond
cried out involuntarily unwilling for
her unique and exciting experience to
end so soon when she might never in
all her lifetime have another you-
you are still-quite-hoarse you know
youd better-get rested-before you
try the streets again

  why thank you he exclaimed as
politely as any casual male caller might
have done i will drop down here on
the stairs a minute for im about all
in

  again he smiled and with such an
air of boyish ingenuousness that miss
raymond was almost tempted into smil-
ing in return she checked herself
the sinister side of the man was bound
to pop up in a moment or two she re-
flected for undoubtedly an individual
of his type must be mostly sinister no
matter how engaging his surface man-
ner

 the lazy brewster emerging from
the sitting room undulatingly paddled
toward the staircase and slowly
mounting a step or two rested both
paws on the strangers knee

 want to make friends with me
queried the intruder as the angora
purringly nosed his chin im willing
if your mistress doesnt object she
knows who i am she says and there-
fore must be the judge

  he appeared so entirely at his ease
that miss raymond experienced a sud-
den feeling of resentment he must
be made to understand that it was con-
descending pity she was extending to
him not courtesy that was plain

  i think it my duty to tell you she
said stiffening into primness that
while im sorry for you i do not sym-
pathize with you in the least those
people are merely doing their duty in
trying to capture you

  its money in their pockets if they
do he answered cheerfully a mis-
chievous twinkle in his big black eyes
money in mine if the- dont but i
couldnt permit them to keep me locked

up  bread and water-the blood-
thirsty indians i simply had to break
away just to show them i could
miss raymond marked the magnifi-
cent muscles of his arm beneath the
disgraceful stripes as he stroked the
willing brewsters back what would
uncle james and aunt julia say if they
ever heard of that unhallowed contact
with his hitherto uncontaminated fur
what would they think of a niece who
would deliberately harbor a hardened
criminal under their sanctified roof-
tree

  she resolved then and there to pre-
serve brewsters good name and her
own by keeping the whole affair a pro-
found and guilt- secret after all if a
girl descends into an abyss of social ex-
periment it really becomes her duty
to look about a bit before leaving it
from a purely educational standpoint if
no other

  perhaps though you think a diet
of bread and water might be good for
me he resumed becoming a bit rest-
less under her meditative eye

  i know its what you deserve she
answered uncompromisingly for 
read about you in the oldport extra not
half an hour ago

  why they didnt put the rumpus in
the paper did thev

  all of it

  i didnt suppose i was important
enough for a write-up

  its printed in full i know just
when you escaped and how and all
about you

  well he remarked vengefully i
owe those fellows one i see that they
must have filled that reporter up with
a nice lot of blackmail about me
theyve made you believe im entirely
unfit for publication but im not

  he looked so young so manly so en-
tirely uncriminal with his direct gaze
answering her own that all at once she
became possessed of a new and fasci-
nating theory regarding him perhaps
he was a martyr hounded by the law
but in reality guiltless and misunder-
stood needing a friend she gave way
to a warm and romantic impulse of
commiseration


smiths magazine

  will you answer me truly if-if i
ask you a very personal question 

  his expression was one of owllike
gravity

  unless the truth within me lies
  are you innocent

 her glance meant to read him
through and through only succeeded in
thrilling him through and through she
was an exquisite picture of exquisite
young girlhood as she sat there in the
big carved hall chair a slant ray of
sunlight crossing her crinkly hair

  are you innocent she repeated
suspecting his silence

 w-well he stammered i-im
not exactly a babe in arms on the one
hand or the most hardened of crimi-
nals on the other

  you arent answering me she said
severely

  he looked down at his ill-fitting
shoes

  because i dont know exactly what
you mean by innocent im-well just
an average fellow you know

  what provocation did you have for
what you did i mean-of course-
your principal offense-attacking your
victim

  oh him he looked at her in-
credulously was that in the paper
too 

  certainly it told the whole story
from the beginning what had the
poor man done to make you his en-
emy 

  oh he laughed he wasnt my en-
emy i wanted his shoes-that was all
 couldnt very well do without em
she recoiled visibly

  for a mere pair of shoes yrou w-ere
guilty of crime

  crime a sudden blaze of anger
shot from his eyes by jove they
must have piled it on pretty thick in
that newspaper yarn then he smiled
reminiscently but of course  cant
blame them i ought to be willing for
them to enjoy themselves at my ex-
pense since im enjoying myself at
theirs what t did to the owner of the
shoes w-as good for him-he wras in
my way i hope the reporter didnt

enlarge on the size of the shoes-theyre
three sizes too large already

  there was no mention of shoes at
all oh how can you speak of such a
terrible thing so lightl-

  his exasperation returned

  will you let me see that confounded
paper for a minute 

  she considered his request gravely
then shook her head

  i dont think it would be right for
me to do so it might give you a clew
of some kind to aid you to escape
after you leave the house i do not wish
to consider myself in any way respon-
sible for you

  its been very kind of you to be re-
sponsible for me at all he said get-
ting to his feet to the discomfiture of
brewster i realize more than ever
what a rawt thing it was to invade your
privacy the way i did but-your pink
shawl-it seemed a beacon light to lure
me-and i turned in without a thought
of how nervy i was he looked to-
ward the sitting-room door if any
of your people are about id like to

apologize-to explain-

  i am alone she announced bravely
and entirely defenseless

  somehow she expected that he would
evince his appreciation of her undis-
mayed candor in making such an ad-
mission to a man in stripes but he
seemed entirely unimpressed

  my thanks are all due to you then
he said starting for the outer exit

  somewhat to her own surprise she
found herself detaining him again

  may i make a few suggestions to
you for your own good before you
go

  you think i need them he smiled
quizzically but the crease between her
narrow bronze erebrows warned him
that she was entirely serious go
ahead-certainly he assented  as far
as you like

  this time she sat on the stairs while
in obedience to a queenly wave of her
hand he sprawled stripedly in the chair
she had vacated the impressiveness
of her manner increased one must as-
sume an air of authority when one sets
out to do a good work in the world
a wager won	

  the reason i wish to talk with you
-to help you-is she informed him
because it seems to me that i see good
in you beneath all surface appearances
i say he interrupted ruefully sur-
face appearances can be explained-if
you mean these beastly togs im wear-
ing

  t feel certain she continued vis-
ualizing herself as holding a torch aloft
for the benefit of a benighted soul
that if others had understood and
been more considerate of you in the
past you would be a different man to-
day

 he shrugged his
shoulders and recrossed
his legs oh no i
wouldnt im a self-
made sinner entirely

my mother is responsi-
ble for my virtues if 
have any but im the
only stockholder in my
assortment of faults

 an awkward pause

ensued holding a torch aloft is rather
wabbly business when one undertakes
it without previous preparation miss
raymond could not think for the life
of her of a single uplifting sentence
but just as she was about to lower an
extinguished beacon a promising sub-
ject occurred to her

  did you make it a point to attend
chapel in the-where you came from
every one does he answered its
compulsory

 compulsory oh yes-there-it

are you innocent she repeated suspecting his silence


smiths magazine

would be of course she said a bit
staggered did you enjoy it she
added after waiting for a more illu-
minating array of words

  i manage to survive

  up went the torch in full splendor
but that is not the way to look at it
-as an infliction you should appre-
ciate chapel for the spiritual good it
does you theres nothing you need
like spiritual good

  id have exchanged it for a ladder
this morning he informed her feel-
ingly

  its your duty to hunger and thirst
for the ethical-the true

  well as a hungerer and thirsterer
- he began flippantly then sub-
sided in the face of her determined
earnestness

   oh if it happens as i think it must
that they capture you and shut you up
again you will try to follow loftier
ideals wont you

  he ached to say the exact thing she
wished to have him say but feared to
experiment so became evasive

  but they cant catch me he gloated
you never expect to see the inside
of those walls again 

  i return of my own free will to-
morrow morning

  of your own free will you mean
that

  surest thing you know

  oh and she clasped enthusiastic
hands thats splendid of you-noble
when you might be able to remain out-
side that dreadful spot forever if you
tried hard enough 

  her exaltation left him untouched
and somewhat perplexed

  oh as to that-i rather like the old
jail to tell the truth i have no wish
to leave until i graduate

  i suppose she said distantly re-
pelled by his matter-of-fact attitude
that one can become accustomed to
most anything even a prison cell if
one must

  talking about prison cells he cried
excitedly pointing through a glass
panel at the side of the big front door
there goes the very chap who blabbed
spectacles and all theyve separated

into detachments i suppose-patrolling
the streets for me he strode the
length of the hall but no matter-
ive got to take my chances some time
and it might as well be now hear
those yowls some more of the men-
agerie not far away you see

  oh please wait just a moment
longer she cried dramatically

  what for

  because if they catch you-they
may string you up to the nearest lamp-
post and it would be on my conscience
forever

  why you act as if you really meant
that

  mean it of course i do

  come now theyre not barbarians
even if they have got it in for me
men do terrible things when the
mob spirit is on them ive heard
uncle jimmie say so

  but you look at this lark of mine

all wrong-

  no i dont i realize your danger
if you do not i positively forbid you
to leave this house in those telltale
clothes

  they can spot me for a mile in
them he assented but what else is
there for me to do

  put on some of uncle jimmies
she replied his room is the first one
to the right at the head of the stairs
open up the windows and you can see
into the closet theres a suit  the
third hook-the church hook-that he
wears to pass the plate in on sundays
but what would uncle jimmie say
he protested

  i dont care what he says youve
got to take them for my peace of mind
-even if you return them afterward
ive been expecting you to demand
them all along people placed as you
are nearly always do it wouldnt
have surprised me in the least if you
had killed me first and then turned
around and helped yourself to what-
ever you liked

  but by this time the striped one was
at the head of the stairs and she heard
the abrupt closing of uncle jimmies
door

  as she trembling and relaxed stum-
a wager won



bled into the sitting room her glance
once more wandered to the outer world
and as it did so something came hur-
tling through the air from above and
landed sprawlingly on the half-dried
blossoms of aunt julias pet hydrangea
bush it was the striped jersey of the
criminal

  at sight of it her mood changed
oh what would uncle james and aunt
julia with their puritanical ideas and
rigid rules of etiquette think of her if
they knew she was assisting-yes ac-
tually assisting-a convict to escape the
just action of the laws he had trans-
gressed  probably what he had said
about intending to give himself up on
the morrow was pure invention to
please her because she had shown a
flattering interest in his welfare
after all carried away by her sympa-
thies was she not making a terrible mis-
take in aiding him 

  she could never quite tell afterward
in thinking it over whether it was the
fear of her relatives or a freshly
roused conscience or just a nervous im-
pulse to be up and doing that made her
go to the telephone but once there she
promptly called up the police depart-
ment put on the wire with captain
blake an old friend of her uncles she
breathlessly informed him that jackson
elderwein was concealed on the prem-
ises attempting a disguise and that she
wished theyd hurry up and come for
him before he got into it and came
downstairs reassured by promises of
earl- aid she hung up the receiver and
turned to face the consequences of her
act whatever they might be

  the fugitive had ceased tramping
about the floor of the room above and
was strangely ominously silent she
had shut herself tightly in the little
compartment where the telephone was
but-had he overheard for the first
time since her initial encounter with
the convict she became really fright-
ened if he had been guilty of man-
slaughter she reflected on light proao-
cation why shouldnt he be guilty of
womanslaughter for the very sufficient
cause she had given him in betraying
him to the police

  then another explanation of his
strange silence occurred to her he
might be robbing the tin box in the up-
per left-hand corner of the chiffonier
where uncle jimmie invariably kept the
sunday-school collection before trans-
ferring it to the bank naturally a man
like that bent on eluding his pursuers
would take any money he could lay
hands on no matter how sacred

  she crept to the foot of the stairs
listening a peculiar sound at last
broke upon her waiting ear could it
be that the wretch w-as so lost to a sense
of his own peril that he had calmly
fallen asleep and was actually daring
to snore indignantly she passed up the
stairs to the closed door of uncle jim-
mies room the snoring continued
with unromantic but healthful regular-
ity she turned the knob cautiously
and peeped in

  there lay the escaped prisoner on
uncle jimmies luxurious leather sofa
his athletic form looking strangely tor-
tured in uncle jimmies narrow-shoul-
dered long-tailed coat and abbreviated
trousers but in spite of his ill-fitting
attire he looked as handsome as a
sleeping hermes one arm was flung
in boyish abandon across the top of his
finely modeled head those long curl-
ing lashes that high noble brow
oh he could not be wholly bad he
could not even if he did snore so hor-
ribly as to make one think him capable
of almost anything how confidently
he had come to her for shelter invited
by the beacon of a tender-lined pink
shawl what a base ignoble act was
hers to betray the soul that trusted her

  as suddenly as she had determined to
give him up to the authorities she now-
resolved to undo her rash act

  uncle jimmies cane stood aslant in
its comfortable corner by the door
grasping it in both hands she gave the
somnolent young man a poke in the
ribs calculated to make him sit up and
take notice

  cut it you geezers he yelled with
a kick that narrowly missed the elbow
of his hostess then assuming a sitting
posture he blinked himself into com-
plete wakefulness


smiths magazine

  wh-why i wasnt asleep was i
he asked plainly embarrassed

  you sounded that way replied
miss raymond with an underlying ac-
cent of reproach

  you dont mean that t was sn-

he paused his face growing red

  horribly-like the honk of uncle
jimmies car

 great caesars ghost i just
dropped down to rest a second before
starting out-worn to a frazzle from
last night-never meant to fall asleep
i ought to be turned over to the police
if t added snoring to my offense

  that is just what happened she
answered hysterically you did snore
-i mean-you have been turned over
to the police-theyre on their way up
here now

 police why who-what-

 some one phoned them that you
were here i cant tell you the persons
name but she-he i mean-regrets do-
ing so now with all her heart

  dear child he said soothingly
dont agitate yourself the police
have no interest in a perfectly harmless
respectable chap like me

  why should you try to deceive me
at the eleventh hour like this she
flung at him tumultuously youre not
harmless and respectable dont i
know your criminal record and all
about you

   criminal record   as suddenly
as if he had been dealt a solar-plexus
blow the caricature of uncle jimmie
doubled up in an armchair why who
do you think i am

  you are jackson elderwein she
panted you escaped from oldport
penitentiary last night-it said so in the
herald oh i wanted to spare you-i
didnt wish to denounce you to your
face as a thick-lipped beetle-browed
convict i tried to ignore it as far as
i could when making my appeal to your
better nature-but i know you are a
manslaughterer and you owned your-
self that you did it for a miserable pair
of shoes there

  while she was speaking he stared at
her agape as she concluded he cov-
ered his face with his hands half turn-

ing his back his neck and ears grew a
reddish purple-his shoulders shook

  at sight of his agitation her flare of
indignation died down and tremulous
pity took its place

  even so she said gently at last i
wish you to have your chance at free-
dom for im convinced you have-re-
deeming qualities but you must go at
once before that phone call to the sta-
tion is answered why-why-you
arent laughing

  if the boys ever find this out he
choked theyve one on me for life
ha ha ha

  find what out

  that ive been mistaken for a jail-
bird

  mistaken

  i dont happen to be this elderwein
party you see-i havent that superla-
tive honor

  then who are you 

  harper price-student at oldport
college you said almost at sight of
me that you knew who i was and i
supposed youd seen my work as half-
back on our football team perhaps i
never dreamed you were sizing me up

  but you are you must be you
spoke of jail yourself-you said you
were fond of it

  jail is a student nickname for old-
port college as distinguished from
oldport pen on the other side of the
river

  but those clothes she cried accus-
ingly determined not to believe him un-
less she must

  some theatrical stuff i corralled in
the storeroom where those frat fellows
locked me up i bet them a hundred
dollars id get out of there and stay out
until after midnight it wont be my
fault if i dont win the wager

  but i cant have made such a mis-
take-i cant she stamped a per-
turbed foot there was a hint of ris-
ing tears in her pretty eyes why id
never respect myself again if it were
true you simply must be what i
thought you-ill never get over it if
you are somebody else

from the yard below destroyed the elo-

for the moment but i can explain my

mistake-

  not all by yourself when i was the
cause of it

  but what if those college boys reach
the house before you get away 

  that only means losing a wager
and id lose a dozen sooner than have
missed meeting you he grinned and
gritted his teeth adding besides they
havent got me yet

  i knew it was a mistake of some
kind captain blake said smilingly
after the situation had been apologeti-
cally and profusely explained to him by

both the young woman and the student
thats why i brought two plain-
clothes men with me miss raymond
and came in my automobile-i didnt
wish to attract unnecessary attention to
the house i drop in often to see your
uncle james and knew  one would
think anything of my presence-unless
there was a patrol wagon in evidence
but how did you know it was a mis-
take queried miss raymond jack-
son elderwein must be somewhere
he is the captain informed her
with a laugh he rolled into the sta-
tion fully an hour before you phoned
me he was roaring drunk and of-
fered to treat the crowd so we got him
without any trouble of course there
was the possibility that your call might
mean another unreported escape but
-and he laid a hand on young prices
shoulder-im glad your captive
proved to be no one worse than a crazy
collcge boy

  send in a bill to me for the trouble
ive caused and ill consider it a fa-
vor said price seriously

  a bill nonsense im a crank on
football you know youre oldports
crack player and id be delighted any
time to help you out of a real scrape if
i could this has been a mere inci-
dent

  then demanded miss raymond
why not help him now

  the captain looked puzzled

 now

  yes

  how 

  by keeping him out of the hands of
the crowd there in the street unob-
served by all but the girl a group of
students had collected quietlyr under
the maple tree in front of the house
casting toward it furtive but trium-
phant glances ever since weve been
standing here theyve been arriving one
by one

  waiting for price eh

  yes he bet them a hundred dol-
lars they couldnt catch him before mid-
night its my fault that hes been held
here so long-and i do want him to
come out ahead captain blake i
a wager won



shant feel right about it unless he
does

  the captain clawed ruminatively at
his gray mustache

  theres only one scheme i can think

of to protect him- he began but

price interrupted

  i dont ask for protection why
miss raymond dont worry about me
and that wager im aching for a good
tussle with those yahoos yonder just
throw a glance me-ward as i strike the

street and youll see-

  wait she commanded plucking
him by the sleeve its only respectful
to captain blake to find out what his
scheme is what is it captain 
well said the captain the crowd
out there is perfectly quiet so i cant
arrest them for disturbing the peace

or for-

  of course not-certainly agreed
price
and-

  but added the officer i can ar-
rest price for disturbing your peace if
you say so miss raymond and keep
him at my home until midnight
well i do say so-emphatically
so im a prisoner am i  asked the
grinning student well i must say
captain blake youre treating me very
badly-so badly that if i ever collect
that hundred im going to divvy with
you

  the captain assumed an air of right-
eous indignation

  no bribery and corruption about it
young man-or  declare it all off he
turned to the waiting policemen go
drive those chaps half a block up the

 course

 im asking  favors captain

street show your badges and tell em
theyre obstructing traffic

  as soon as the policemen had the
crowd  the move captain blake
walked swiftly toward his waiting au-
tomobile from a few yards distant
the college boys watched him with inter-
est pie stooped and spoke to his
chauffeur making mysterious gestures
toward the opposite end of the street
apparently some real trouble unre-
lated to their fellow student was brew-
ing in oldport avenue so absorbed
were they in figuring out what it was
that the pursuit of harper price was
lost sight of until suddenly they saw
that oddly clothed individual step into
the machine beside the captain

  with a roar they broke past the two
policemen intent on seizing their prey
alas too late their prey thrust his
hands under his long coat tails and
waved them a mocking farewell as the
automobile made a swift turn and shot
like an arrow up the golden street leav-
ing the defeated frat men to make
frantic and useless guesses as to what it
meant and how it had all come about

  harper price joined the delta gam-
ma phis voluntarily after his trium-
phant winning of the wager and some
say that he spent the hundred dollars
 the supper he gave them afterward
to celebrate his initiation others con-
tend that the money went to charity
miss raymond whose visit to her rela-
tives in oldport was prolonged as never
before says nothing but she looks at
a beautiful solitaire on her engagement
finger and-miss raymond knows

f f you have imagination you walk unchallenged in the realm
 of possibilities and see within your reach the far star
success

  imagine think dream  if within your soul you build
no new thing and dare nothing and fling to the coming years
 golden rope of fancy you clasp upon your wrists the man-
acles of mediocrity and fasten to your feet the chains of
futility

  the goal to which ambition beckons you is built in the
heart of those dominions over which imagination rules she
is the architect the everlasting empress of the fortunes of
every man

  for centuries we talked and sang and dreamed of the
supernal arrogance of icarus whose melted wings dashed him
into the sea but to-day the factories make majestic planes
that clip the silver fringes from the clouds

  the great poet wrote that no man could paint the rose but
you and i know a californian who gives new colors to every
blossom in natures brilliant catalogue

  mvthologists told of echo and described her as the wan-
dering homeless goddess of the latins but now that dream
has been put upon the point of a needle and echo humanized
at last sings in a million homes the lyrics of a thousand years

  men once sought the shelter of their caves when joves
thunderbolts shook the heavens but the electric terror of
ancient times has become our servant and is held captive on
a copper thread

  dream think by so doing men have hung upon the
screen of life every beauty every noble thing the world has
known

  swear such allegiance to imagination give her such tribute
of your time that she will be kind to you and send you upon
the rays of the moon and on the fragrant breaths of flowers
mystic and mighty visitors-artists to embroider on your brain
plans of power-swift couriers to lead you to new treasure
houses-locksmiths to fashion keys to heavens yet untrod

the scepter of imagination-dreams and visions-has ruled
the progress of the earth her scepter is still undimmed

  and if you draw but near enough to touch the hem of her
bejeweled robe the starry heights are yours

the presbyterian church at jones
corners was a pleasant place
happily free from the unfortu-
nate attempts at decoration that mar
so many houses of worship in small
communities it was a low wooden
structure painted white and a row of
great oak trees stood in front of it like
so many guardians some old lover of
the sacred spot had planted green
shrubs all about the edifice lilac and
forsythia and syringa so in spring the
air was heavy with their perfume and
until the frosts came there was a green
garland lying around it like a ring that
holds a jewel

  the new ministers wife had been a
struggling art student when she married
a struggling minister jones corners
had been their new charge and they
had come to it with a pleasant feeling
of expectancy in the new relation

  a very good kind people had made
them welcome the community was
prosperous and maintained a comfort-
able manse the sunny open rooms
had been prepared by willing hands for
the coming of the new minister and his

    

wife the ladies sewing society had
given a new rug for the living room 
mrs weatherby had put flowering
plants in the windows every one had
tried to do something to express a wel-
come the house was ready for them
and the larder stocked

 it was known that the wyndam
came from a discouraging struggle that
they had met bravely with bare neces-
sities and jones corners was ready to
make amends to them it all seemed
too good to be true mrs wyndam said

  she wept a little against her hus-
bands shoulder after lemuel wilson
who had met them at the station had
driven away taking with him the com-
mittee of ladies who were at the manse
door to bid them welcome home

  it was late spring and toward even-
ing a bright fire burned on the hearth
in the living room and in the dining
room supper lay spread for them a
generous dainty feast prepared by the
best cooks in jones corners

  paul wyndam dried his wifes tears
and repeated her words it all seems
too good to be true he said
	smiths magazine

she saw mrs quimbys face as she watched her daughter with rapt unquestioning adoration

  the next morning they went to look
at the church

  its absolutely perfect declared
mrs wyndam oh paul its love-
ly isnt it wonderful to see how they
-theyve kept it so simple and lovely 
see-theyve left the plain glass in the
windows

  she wandered about the little church
viewing it from the pulpit from the
choir loft and from the pews and the
organist came in while she was there

  miss pierce was no longer young
she had remnants of a delicate beauty
and a girlish manner quite untouched

by any consciousness of the years that
had touched her she loved her music
and had found in it consolation for
more than one sorrow she played with
the abandon of emotion mrs wyn-
dam lingered to listen as she played

  she really loves it mrs wyndam
whispered to her husband mrs wyn-
dams beauty-loving soul had been with-
out food and she was emotional

thats perfectly lovely she cried
and came back into the loft again and
have we a good choir miss pierce
miss pierce flushed a little well
-riio she said as if regretting to ad-
and mary ellen sang



mit the fact really we havent mrs
wyndam

  she coughed a little

  i wonder if i shouldnt have asked
thought mrs wyndam and then miss
pierce began to explain a little half
shyly

  you see she said george french
has gone to the city and mabel wal-
ters is married and-and-- well-

we gave it up after a while and now
we just have a precentor and congrega-
tional singing

  miss pierce smiled dubiously and be-
gan to speak of something else

  it seems a funny thing to be embar-
rassed about said mrs wyndam to
her husband as they went home
neither of them thought much more of
the matter until sunday morning

  the odor of the blossoming shrubs
came through the windows like an in-
cense to carry their prayers alofu
there was a pleasant air of expectancy
as the congregation gathered clad in
their best to do honor to the day and to
the new minister after the opening
prayer paul wyndam announced the
hymn and the organ responded joy-
ously 

      how beautiful it is to come
      into thy courts with singing

  mary ellen quimby sat well to-
ward the front of the church she
was a young girl rather conspicuously
dressed folks look at mary ellen
so mrs quimby was wont to ex-
plain its only right and proper she
should look good when shes so kind
of prominent-so to speak

  so the cotton roses trembled above
mary ellens hat and mary ellens
mother who did not rise with the rest
of the congregation leaned back in her
pew and folded her worn hands en-
joying to the utmost her single hour of
perfect satisfaction in the week

  there aint nobody in jones corners
can sing with my mary ellen mrs
quimby was wont to say

  nor against her either miss per-
kins was known to have murmured an
irreverent aside

  mrs wyndams sensitive ear was

sorely shocked she saw mrs lemuel
wilson close her hymn book and put it
back in the rack with a gesture of resig-
nation she saw mrs temple look at
her husband and sigh and she saw her
own husband who had begun to sing
the hymn with his customary devotion
glance over the edge of his book and
the pulpit railing and eye mary ellen
speculatively and she saw mrsouim-
bys face as she watched her daughter
with rapt unquestioning adoration

       how beautiful it is to come
       into thy courts with singing

  mary ellen really sang the last stanza
as a solo mrs wyndam breathed a
little sigh of relief when it was over
she was conscious of a slight tension
through the whole assembly and she
was inattentive through the lesson and
the prayer

  when her husband announced the
second hymn she bit her lip to keep
from smiling for paul wyndam said
gravely we will omit the second
third and fourth verses

  that left mary ellen only two but
she sang them lustily

  mrs wyndam forgot her distress
briefly during the sermon she was so
anxious to have paul do his best to
have these dear good people pleased
with their new minister and she loved
him and was proud of him so she did
not think of mary ellen again until it
was time for the last hymn

  miss pierce ventured to introduce the
subject at dinner mrs lemuel wil-
son had invited mr and mrs wyndam
and miss pierce to go home with her
and her husband

  we really feel very badly about
mary ellen said miss pierce but no
one wants to say anything you know
we wouldnt hurt mrs quimbys feel-
ings for the world wre keep hoping
something will happen

  and she sings regularly said mrs
wilson that girl never has anything
the matter with her a little cold now
would be the greatest kind of relief to
the rest of us but she never gets it

  mrs wyndam giggled a little appre-
ciatively


smiths magazine

  it broke up the choir remarked
lemuel wilson they all got per-
fect i discouraged

  you see explained mrs wilson
mrs quimby is such a good woman
she is a widow and does days work
-washing and ironing and cleaning-
and mary ellen is her joy in life she
simply adores mary ellen weve all
known- her for years and years and
we cant bear to hurt her so-mrs
wilson shrugged her shoulders-mary
ellen sings

  at the evening service mary ellen
sang how firm a foundation lustily
and alone she had a big voice not
placed but sliding along the scale now
off the key now out of time raucous
and penetrating it quite filled the beau-
tiful little church and drove the wor-
shipers to frenzy

  we had a prayer meeting about it
once miss pierce told mrs wyndam
and we asked the lord to do some-
thing without hurting mrs quimbys
feelings

  one day mrs wyndam came to the
home missionary society with a plan
for mary ellen she was growing ac-
quainted with the women at the cor-
ners and was learning to depend upon
their generous hearts and ready serv-
ices

  ive been wondering said the new
ministers wife if we couldnt arrange
to give mary ellen a few singing les-
sons miss pierce tells me that a really
good teacher is coming to milton once
a week if we could arrange to get
mary ellen over and back-and do it
nicely you know as a present from the
church because we appreciate how she
tries to help-she does try you know
mercy yes said mrs lemuel
wilson and manys the time ive
wished shed give it up

  mrs wj-m dams cheeks were pink
with excitement if we could pay for
a few lessons she continued and get
her over and back once a week-and
just suggest you know to the teacher-

a mr phillips i believe he is-

  all the ladies were interested now
they liked mrs wyndam and this was
her first suggestion to them

  we might tell him you know said
mrs wyndam that he could tellher
not to strain her voice

  the moments silence that followed
this speech was broken by soft laugh-
ter

  well im willing to pay for a few
lessons myself said mrs lemuel wil-
son suppose we ask him to tell her
she ought not to sing at all

  no-no protested mrs wyndam
she might suspect

  so they plotted laughingly

  and to think said mrs quimby
how they do appreciate mary ellen
the ladies aid society giving her
singing lessons-and mrs wyndam so
kind  cultivating of her voice 

  the good soul worked with a happy
heart and mary ellen began to put on
mysterious airs after a week or two
mrs lemuel wilson was able to keep
her book open through the entire hymn
and voices began to rise from different
parts of the church by and by there
was talk of organizing a choir and to
every ones surprise mary ellen re-
fused to join

  mr phillips says i mustnt strain
my voice she said i only do exer-
cises now

  it seems too good to be true said
mrs wyndam

  and then one day mrs wilson sur-
prised the sewing society

  do you know said mrs wilson
that when i went to pay mr phillips
for mary ellens lessons he told me that
she was doing very nicely and that he
had been able to get her one of the free
scholarships at a school over near bos-
ton i certainly was surprised

  isnt that funny exclaimed mrs
temple

  he said said mrs wilson that
he had found work for her mother
there and mary ellen could have a les-
son every day and be taught other
things she ought to know

  well i declare said mrs winter-
bourne

  i was so surprised continued mrs
wilson that i didnt ask him anyof
the things i wish i had now but i did
and macry ellen sang	

in the back of the church a velvet voice arose taking up the strain softly yet with a tone so sweet that
it wrapped itself about one like a soft comforting garment

say do you really think she has a
voice  

  has a voice interrupted miss per-
kins couldnt she be heard from here
to milton every sunday morning

 well said mrs wilson he said
why yes it wasnt placed and her
car needed training you cant think
how amazed i was to hear him speak-
ing seriously about mary ellens
voice

 yes i can said mrs temple

 once or twice when some one spoke
of mrs quimby it was said vaguely

that she had a place in boston mary
ellen sent picture post cards to mrs
wyndam and mrs wilson with scant
information written on the edge it was
more than two years before they came
back to the corners

  then one sunday morning as paul
wyndam rose to face his congregation
he saw in the back of the church a
young woman who held his attention
for a minute pie did not place her
in his recollection until he glanced at
the decently clad woman who sat by
her and saw the womans eyes fixed
with the old rapt worshiping gaze

author of influencing our children true love etc

my dear theodora yester-
day afternoon i received your
letter written  that sad day
in your calendar the anniversary of
your little daughters death what you
said remained with me all during the
evening all during the night and i
wake to find that it is still with me this
morning

  for once theodora i am going to
claim the last privilege of friendship i
am going to presume to take you to
task for your attitude toward life and
duty we have known each other near-
ly twenty years we have loved each
other served each other rejoiced and
grieved with each other there ought
to be nothing in which we fear to speak
the truth as we see it to each other
and yet t confess it is with a sinking of
the heart that i speak the truth to you

  first of all you know how deeply
and sincerely i sympathize with you in
the loss of your little girl have i not
known the awful loneliness of empty
rooms their heartbreaking silences 
have i too not seen glimmering be-
fore me in the crowded streets figures
that mocked me with their likeness to
figures that walked the streets 
longer have  not known the ache
of yearning arms have  not hidden
my eyes from the brightness of the blue
sky because of eyes that could 
longer behold it oh theodora i
need not tell you that i sympathize ut-

terly with you in your grief that i
know how the first unclouded bright-
ness of the world is darkened forever
and how the flavor of life is forever
changed

  but-i will quote from your letter
she was my all my reason for being
what is a childless woman she is not
only a lonely woman she is a useless
woman all the occupations with which
she pretends to justify her existence are
but makeshifts-such futile makeshifts
when my dear little blossom left me
not only was life stripped barren of its
joy of its hope of the light that danced
and the birds that sang but it was
stripped of its dignity of its worth

  t know now that i shall never have
another child and i feel myself a fail-
ure a discredited woman i look with
envy upon the mothers in the italian
tenements where i do my miserable
district visiting children they have in
abundance though they lack food
clothes the decencies of life they
have not failed in their mission i find
it almost possible to envy the poor crea-
ture who slinks along the street with a
fatherless child held close against her
dirty shawl more and more it seems
to me that not only is there  joy for
women without children but no worth
no splendor  dignity-

  theodora von speak with the poign-
ant note of suffering the thing that has
been taught to women for ages the
smiths magazine

thing that the church desiring vast
dominion in things spiritual and things
temporal desiring subjects to rule and
to do its bidding has taught them  the
thing that the striving nations with
their bloody need of warriors for all the
battlefields of history have taught
them the thing nature and god if you
will have taught them through the seed
implanted in their hearts but speak-
ing this thing as you do theodora-
vehemently extremely-you have kin-
dled a flame of rebellion in me against
the teaching of the ages and almost
against instinct itself you are mor-
bid with grief but you carry to its logi-
cal conclusion the doctrine that we
women have ail been so constantly
taught-the doctrine of a dignity of
motherhood so transcendent that no
other dignities exist by its side you
have pushed me to deny it

  if a woman is an immortal soul-
nay if she is a human entity a person-
ality an individual-she is of herself
important in the great plan of creation
apart from her use as a mother of the
race else--t speak with the gravest
conviction theodora-the race i not
worth continuing tf the race constant-
ly reproduces individuals whose only
use is to reproduce more individuals
then the race is not worth continuing

  it is because yon have been taught
in a thousand subtle and a thousand
patent ways the reverse of this doctrine
of the worth the use of women apart
from their child-bearing function that
you are now dragging out that most
abject of all existences the existence of
a woman who does not believe in her
own right to be because she denies the
value of the contribution she makes to
the world

  consider for a few minutes-as i
have been considering ever since i read
your letter-the childless women of
your acquaintance and of your knowl-
edge outside the limits of your ac-
quaintance consider first the unmar-
ried women can you place your hand
on your heart and swear to me that
there is a smaller proportion of the no-
bility that gives dignity and worth to
life among the old maids of your ac-

-quaintance than among the wives and
mothers you cannot do it theodora
women do not often remain single for
the mere humiliating reason that no-
body asks them to marry they remain
unmarried half of them because they
are unselfish self-sacrificing

   i think my cousin sarah is a type of
 at least half the unmarried women of
 our acquaintance she has devoted her
 youth and her early maturity to her
 parents the time has never come
 when she with her lofty ideals of the
 love and duty she owed them has felt
 that they could spare her would she
 have been a finer woman a higher-
 minded woman if she had followed the
 first alluring call of sex attraction or
 even the call of love itself to the altar
 you know very well she would not have
 been you and i may think that she
 has made a mistake but at any rate it
 was not an ignoble mistake and is
 fineness high-mindedness self-abnega-
 tion of no use of no dignity in the
 world 

  half the unmarried women of my
acquaintance are like sarah in varying
degrees their own families need
them their overworked underpaid
fathers need the help of their weekly
pa- envelopes their monthly checks
their invalided mothers worn out with
the rapid bearing of more children than
their strength could rear properly need
them at home the younger children
need them they are unmarried child-
less because they choose to respond to
these needs rather than to seek their
own immediate happiness and that
worth and dignity as mothers about
which you theodora talk with such
morbid eloquence if such women have
not a worth and dignity of their own
as fine though not so joyous as that
of any mother in the world then we
have been wrongly taught and the path
of self-denial is not the path of great
honor

   but of course i know that you and
 all the good people who talk and write
 about the grandeur of motherhood and
 imply the worthlessness of all other
 womanly careers do not mean to in-
 m elude in your strictures the unmarried
the childless woman



women even the most fanatically in-
sistent of you will allow that in a non-
polygamous civilization in which the
women outnumber the men there must
be childless women but for the child-
less wives there is no extenuation in
your condemnations

  i will confess at once that though i
have not met the deliberately childless
wife of popular reprobation who re-
fuses for trivial reasons the dangers of
childbearing and the restrictions of
child rearing i suppose she exists she
must preachers could not go on
preaching at her writers writing at her
editors fulminating at her unless they
had first ascertained that she was a real
person she doesnt happen to exist in
my limited circle of acquaintance
though there are childless wives there
upon them rests not only the cloud of
sorrow that childlessness casts upon
even gallant-spirited women-the cloud
of unsatisfied present yearnings and
hopes of unsatisfied pride in race of
an uncompanioned old age-but there is
generally also the cloud of doubt as to
their own use in the world-the result
of ceon-old teaching about the com-
parative worthlessness of the childless
woman

 to some of these women children
are denied by what we used to call in
a more primitively pious age the will
of god to-day the scientists have a
dozen explanations of the fact more
appealing to our sense of divine benig-
nancy to our true piety than that and
perhaps containing more hope for an-
other generation with its dreams of
motherhood its aspirations toward that
dearest and most intimate form of hu-
man service-the service to ones chil-
dren but the scientists have not al-
tered the situation for the grieving
wives of this generation they leave
them grieving like you theodora and
without help

 for such women it does not greatly
matter whether science says that they
owe their childlessness to some fault in
their own ancestry or that of their hus- 
bands or to their own ill-directed physi-
cal education or to their husbands or
to the ignorance of doctors or the care-

less experimentation of surgeons the
why for them has ceased to be im-
portant however important it may be
to coming generations they have no
children and they have been taught to
believe deep in their hearts that hav-
ing no children they have no real ex-
cuse for being

  then there are the few women who
have chosen to be childless for legiti-
mate reasons not connected with their
vanity  their desire for an irrespon-
sible freedom they may have become
aware of taint physical or mental in
their own blood or that of their hus-
bands which they decline to pass on to
descendants or they feel themselves
for some industrial reason totally un-
equal to the task of bringing children up
properly

  personally you or i may think it a
misfortune that these women are unable
to perform a mighty act of faith and to
believe that the gift of life is greater
than the gift of anything that life af-
fords-education or health prosperity
or honor but if you and i take this
stand we shall be side by side with the
medieval churchmen demanding that
women furnish subjects to swell the
power of the church and with the lords
of feudal tribes demanding that wom-
en furnish them with men at arms
to help them in their battles to both of
these numerical strength was the im-
portant thing but we shall not find
ourselves standing beside the modern
eugenists some of whom hope to ac-
complish for the masses by law what
the women whom t have just described
have elected to accomplish for them-
selves individually

  it may possibly be that the wonderful
mysticism of the church declaring in
every human birth that an immortal
soul was created to be saved for eternal
joy and service was truer than the hard
teaching of the modern eugenist pro-
claiming that society must protect itself
against the breeding of the unfit how-
ever that may be we cannot deny to the
women who choose to be childless for
what seems to them the good and the
happiness of the race a logical and an
honorable ground upon which to stand


smiths magazine

  and to all these women-the un-
unmarried the involuntarily even
heartbrokenly childless the childless
from a prudence that is not selfish yes
even to women like yourself who are
childless because their children have
died-you deny an equal worth in the
world with other happier women not
only you theodora but every writer
and every speaker who overemphasizes
the dignity of motherhood by slurring
the dignity of the childless does this

  it is the fashion for perfervid orators
and writers upon this subject to assume
that all mothers are the mothers of lin-
colns they demand to know if any
advocate of careers for women or
any woman who has succeeded in hav-
ing a career has ever made a contribu-
tion to the world like that of nancy
hanks probably not but aaron
burr benedict arnold-every traitor
whose name is execrated and all the
little traitors whose names are forgot-
ten-these had mothers as truly as
washington and lincoln and all the
forgotten men whose labors made pos-
sible the fulfillment of the ideals of
these remembered heroes

  if marcus aurelius that upright em-
peror and philosopher who would have
been canonized had the stoics been
given to the making of saints had
a mother so also had nero and
do you not think that oueen eliza-
beth with all the shortcomings that
can be alleged against that spinster
queen gave a more valuable con-
tribution to the world than the moth-
er-of lucretia borgia let us say
and whose name do you think shines
brighter in history-that of joan of arc
or that of the mother of catherine de
medici 

  but let us come down to times with
which we are more familiar frankly
theodora do you not think that flor-
ence nightingale was of more use in the
world than the women whose contribu-
tion to society was the bunch of politi-
cal grafters convicted of wholesale
theft a few years ago in one state or
the group of gamblers and gunmen late-
ly exposed in another do you not
think that clara barton did almost is

much for the world as the women
whose sons fell wounded upon the bat-
tlefield where her brigades were busy
in stanching wounds and saving lives

  when you write about the worthless-
ness of your life since your child has
died and imply in every line your sense
of the beauty and grandeur of mother-
hood per se do not forget that jesse
pomeroy had a mother do not forget
that the loathsome tribe of cadets who
prey upon the helpless ignorant girls of
the poor sections of the city all had
mothers the prisons are full of men
who had mothers as truly as did abra-
ham lincoln so are the club windows
with their glimpses of idle vacant
overfed faces so are the directors
meetings at which tricky dishonesties
are planned

  tt is not enough to be a mother to
gain honor one must be the mother of
useful and honorable men and women
and every woman who helps no matter
how indirectly in the work of making
the sons and daughters of other women
all that they should be is worthy also
to stand beside the mothers in honor

  it has sometimes seemed to me the-
odora that this deep-rooted doctrine of
the high dignity of motherhood per se
-of course i subscribe with all my
heart to the doctrine of the dignity of
motherhood unless there is stated as
its corollary the worthlessness of every-
thing else womanly-had its rise not
only in the needs of church and war-
like states but in some old effort to
keep women satisfied they have al-
ways been trying to keep us satisfied
you know the men our rulers and
when of old the women felt stirring
within them little desires for adven-
ture little ambitions for a more varied
service than that of the fireside when
they said but i should like to take
time to write a tragedy to be tried out
at the great games at athens or i
think i should enjoy riding behind our
lord charlemagne against the enemy 
should love to see the banners waving
and to hear the bugles blowing and to
catch the flash of all the glittering ar-
mor then i think the ancient poet
and the medieval warrior used to say
the childless woman



 tush tush my dear the work
that you are doing is so much finer so
much more magnificent than anything
that we can possibly do you must be
contented to stay at home and to let us
attend to these more trifling matters of
literature and war the most honor-
able work in all the world is the bearing
and rearing of children and the crown
with which you are crowned is far
more resplendent than the dusty wreath
of laurel i may win from my verses or
the bays that may bind my victorious
head there is no work so high and
worthy as yours my dear nothing is
so to be reverenced so stay you at
home and keep the fire upon the hearth
and tend the children and forget the
foolish idea that you would like to sway
an audience with your words or to be
thrilled by the sight of all the glittering
panoply of battle

 and because there was a germ of
truth in this theodora and because
women from time immemorial have
been singularly susceptible to flattery-
else i solemnly believe the world would
not have gone on-the ladies sat at
home and took the alleged reverence
of their men bestowed upon them as
mothers in lieu of all else that the
world offers and that is why it is so
hard to-day to make a woman realize
that the dignity of her position as a
mother rests not upon the number of
her children-not upon her mere fe-
cundity in short-but upon the use they
are to the world and it is that which
makes it difficult for them to realize that
whoever is of use to the world-man
or woman spinster childless wife or
happy mother-is equally honorable

 suppose my dear theodora that
your little girl had lived what doc
trine of worth and dignity would you
have taught her would you have said
to her my dear one you have a single
purpose in the world you are to bear
children you are to bear daughters
and to teach them to bear daughters
willingly proudly until the end of
time is that what you would have
taught her theodora

 or would you have taught her that
there is great work to be done in the

world that there is ignorance to be en-
lightened sickness to be healed sorrow
to be comforted liberty to be gained
joy and beauty to be diffused by means
of every art and that as she and her
children if she happened to have any
bore their part in all this great work
they would be clothed with the beauti-
ful garments of dignity

  if you can imagine yourself teaching
her the doctrine that you have adopted
for your own the doctrine of the utter
worthlessness of anything else a wom-
an may do in the world compared with
bringing children into it i think you
would have been giulty of a dreadful
cruelty of a dreadful atheism

  i have said atheism i can almost
see your shocked incredulous stare
but i mean exactly that i know no
more conclusive way of denying any
divine purpose in this world of deny-
ing any divine plan in which human be-
ings may hope to share than that of de-
claring that each generation exists but
to produce another generation if this
is so then indeed are we but as the
beasts that perish but if each gen-
eration besides having laid upon it the
injunction to leave descendants to go on
with the worlds work has some part
of the worlds work-the divine plan
-to carry out itself then each exist-
ence is fully justified each existence
that is that does its share of the work

  i am not for an instant attempting to
deny theodora that those women who
are mothers have the easiest and most
joyful lot in the world their work is
so to speak cut out for them they can
excuse themselves for many failures
for many shortcomings on the ground
that after all these things do not great-
ly matter their children will make right
their mistakes will atone for their in-
dolence but i do not need to point out
to you that this is a very dangerous at-
titude of mind if they are really desir-
ous of forwarding the work of the
world

  you may tell me-i almost think i
hear you telling me-that this is all very
well that the exceptional woman
though childless may be allowed to be
of some service and therefore worthy


smiths magazine

of some honor in the world you will
allow me my joan of arc my queen
elizabeth my florence nightingale my
jane ad dams but for the rank and
hie of childless women you will concede
no such claims to dignity and impor-
tance

  very well then i in my turn will
allow you your mary washington and
your nancy hanks and your few score
of mothers who have given great work-
ers to the world but i will not con
cede you the honor and dignity of your
rank and file of mothers-your bridge -
playing neighbor in the house across the
street your gadabout next door i
claim for my army of teachers of
trained nurses of district visitors of
settlement workers-yes even of girls
and women at work in shops and stores
and factories for their own livelihood
and the helping of their families-for
all these mere privates in the great army
of unselfish workmen i claim worth and
the honor due to worth even as you
claim it for all the unknown mothers
of men and women who will never be
known to the great world but who will
keep the great world going there is
no worth or honor in anything theo-
dora except in service whether we are
looking at men or women mothers or
childless women and where there is
service  matter how lonely there is
always dignity

  of course women will tell you and
truly that to go childless through life
is not to have the full experience of
life but experience of life is a com-
plex and mystic thing there is an ex-
perience of renunciation as well as an
experience of fulfillment there is an
experience of poverty as well as of
riches i doubt if lazarus picking the
crumbs from dives table was aware of
his limited experience of life in com-
parison with the full-fed dives there
is no experience of life worthy of the
name which is gained by snatching for
it and there is no deprivation which

gallantly accepted may not be mysteri-
ously transmuted into part of lifes
mystical treasure

  as i reread this letter i am almost
appalled that i should have dared to
write it to you crushed as you are by
grief but it is because you are crushed
too by a feeling that has none of the
holiness of grief-the feeling of the
worthlessness of your existence-that
i have dared to write it i shall not
mind it though it makes you very angry
provided that after the anger is passed
you discern the germ of truth in my
contention service usefulness with
their concomitant of dignity and even
of joy are possible to every one to you
as well as the rest do you remember
that poem of stevensons that we used
to read when we were girls i think
you must have forgotten it it is the
one that begins you know-

     if i have faltered more or less
     in my great task of happiness-

and he goes on with a list of the com
mon everyday things that should have
stirred him to happiness-books and
his food and summer rain and then
he prays that if these have failed to
keep him at his great task he may be
made to suffer

  lord thy most pointed pleasure take

  and stab my spirit broad awake

  or lord if too obdurate i

  choose thou before my spirit die

  a killing pain a stabbing sin

  and to my dead heart run them in

  it is the prayer for all of us-that
prayer to be saved from the dead heart
that no longer feels the great task of
happiness-of service-within it it is
the prayer for all of us declaring as it
does that every common experience and
every deprivation must tend to the same
end-of happiness which we who live
under the modern dispensation believe
to be joyous conscious service think
it over theodora and try in time to
forgive me the lecture i have read you

iiiustrated by ci-arence howe

dapper melone gazing from
his solitary window looked grim

       this was a remarkable feat
for dapper considering how slight and
pleasant was his face he had often
looked dignified and  especial oc-
casions correct-after the manner of
his trousers his behavior his letters
home but this correctness like the
trousers and the behavior had been no
part of the actual dapper it had been
an external application worn with ap-
proving consciousness and laid aside
when he went home to bed

  the grimness on the contrary arose
from within he felt it gnawing at his
soul but he knew not that it sat upon
his face dapper was contemplating
suicide

 it was raining the gray university
buildings loomed through a dark and
icy veil more distinctly the line of
shops opposite rose from the swimming
sidewalk their loose-hung signs and ir-
regular little roofs seeming to shiver in
the rain

  dapper was gazing at a man the only
human figure in this effluvial scene he
wore no overcoat his hat was drawn
forward as if to protect his face and he
leaned listlessly beneath the drooling
eaves of bonis chili stand

  poor devil the fellows usually re-
marked at sight of this mournful dere-
lict and once in a way a passing
friendly hand clapped him upon the
shoulder a friendly face smiled into
his at which the poor devil would
start laugh a bit and edge away

  but dapper never poored anybody
down and out eh  said dapper
simple enough poisons cheap

  by which you will see that he was a
very strong-minded person and now
that he stood arraigning the fates on
his own score now that he had begun
to reap his own unconscious sowing
singularly enough appeared this ghost
of ernest abbott this echo of past ad-
monition poison

  true their dilemmas as dapper re-
minded himself were not the same far
be it from him to go about looking like
ernest abbott but when it came to
a point of having reached ones wits
ends then elbow to elbow they stood
looking over the edge-abbott with ai
aimless tranquillity letting the rain run
down his hat brim dapper grimly as
i have said for dapper was consid-
ering his own advice very well
poison

  but he would see florine shaw to the
german first it should be a success


smiths magazine

that german as glorious as he could
make it and he knew a thing or two
about germans then he would take
cyanide of potassium

  it was swift he understood and not
disfiguring he would lead the dance
with florine see her safely home and
an hour later be laid like paolo beau-
tiful as a sleeper at her feet

  it was inevitable that unless he died
speedily he must flunk in his biology
this would undoubtedly mean a slow
death at the hands of the folks at home
they expected incredible things of him
and he would not-he positively would
not-take boadicea to another german

  boadicea was the sole daughter of
professor hodge professor hodge
occupied the chair of biology-vener-
ably boadicea occupied her fathers
heart-entirely exclusively supremely

  for the bugs and fishes amid which
he dwelt professor hodge had a deep
and abiding esteem but boadicea he un-
remittingly worshiped the fishes he
had known always she had come to
him late quite past the years it ap-
peared of his better judgment her
real name was winnie but winnie was
inappropriate

  dapper recalled last years german
the president of the green elephants
had commanded him to escort boadicea
it was dappers initial year at the uni-
versity but he had been sufficiently en-
lightened to decline the president had
offered him a scarf pin and a pink
bath robe dapper had yielded he had
taken boadicea

  he remembered her sitting back
against the wall she wore a lavender
dress with a dutch neck boadicea in
anything so ingenue as a dutch neck
she was gazing with perfect calm about
the room slowly fanning herself the
room was aflutter with fresh frills and
flowers rustling with eagerly sought
programs musical with deep voices and
light laughter but boadicea was
alone

  dapper had plowed here and there
forward and back his brow drawn his
bosom panting fie had been rushing
boadiceas program before the even-
ing was over he had managed to fill it

all but two dances the triumph had
cost him the greater part of his trans-
ferable wardrobe including the scarf-
pin and the pink bath robe

  but at the next meeting of the green
elephants he had been openly com-
mended they had made him presi-
dent

  dapper remembered shaking every-
bodys hand and contriving a neat little
speech in which he thanked everybody
and took the oath of office with modest
dignity fie had felt very sure of him-
self anybody in his home town could
tell you- but then leading a ger-
man as it transpired was not the sole
duty of the chief of the green ele-
phants

  one of his obligations was to find an
escort for winnie flodge-or take her
himself this particular feature of the
office had caused one or two presidents
to shrink from the distinction of a sec-
ond term the unwritten law however
had never been abolished for boadi-
ceas triumphs and failures palpably af-
fected the temperature of her fathers
laboratory

  dapper was not a shining light in
professor flodges class and anyr fla-
grant neglect of winnie bade fair to ex-
tinguish him altogether now there
was the bi-exam almost upon him and
there was the german to-morrow night
and there was florine shaw

  dapper had -tried let no man sup-
pose that dapper had not used every
method of coercion known to the tradi-
tions of the green elephants prom-
ises prayer profanity he had employed
each in turn without avail if there
was any man willing to qualify for mar-
tyrdom at any price he belonged to the
outer darkness of some other fraternity
and such was not expected to attend the
german

  only a green elephant could bring
boadicea and the green elephants had
stampeded en masse in his room-this
room-they had stampeded one hour
before ancl in full view of every cher-
ished object he possessed dapper
looked sadly upon the upheaval of
wardrobe and bureau drawers rejected
upon the bed even the silver hat
boadicea and the gcreen elephants



ill speak out straight we want the distinction of having you for a member

brush and the blue lamp shade his aunt
had embroidered with cat tails to cheer
his midnight toil even the old dre-ss
suit-perfectly good-the turkish bath
slippers they had all admired-every-
thing was there and it had failed

 if he had not already asked florine
- no let him not deceive him-
self even if he had not asked florine
he would not take boadicea

 he would rather take the potassium

 there came a knock at the door
come in growled dapper

 and in walked cedric vaughan the
president of last year

 heard the news  asked vaughan

news could boadicea have died
suddenly dapper opened his mouth
he could not speak

 ernest abbott has turned in a per-
 fectly corking thing on bismarck

 dapper leaned against the window
 abbott bismarck he repeated

 whats the matter you ninny
 asked vaughan

did you say winnie  dapper
breathed

 vaughan looked at the array on the
 bed then he remembered sit
 down  he commanded

-cl 


smiths magazine

  dapper sat down meekly on the blue
lamp shade

  im talking about those eulogies we
had to write for rutledge i did na-
poleon-nough to make him shake
down his monument turning over you
did lincoln

  oh yes murmured dapper

  well ernest abbott has turned in
a thing on bismarck thats-great rut-
ledge is tearing his hair over it read it
out to the ciass by george then he
got up and poked lincoln in the stove
i like his nerve said dapper
put napoleon out of the window
cant blame him they didnt belong
in the room with that bismarck why
man it was alive

  that bum

 who oh abbott hes a bum
now all right wish youd seen him
four years ago

  saw him just now-front of bonis
seedy as the dickens three times a
day he goes to bonis rooms at a
lean-to down the street dogged if i
wouldnt go away-or take poison

  i asked him once why he didnt go
away said vaughan thoughtfully i
remember he never had to dig sort
of found things lying around on the
surface and brought em in to class all
worked up and done over it was great
spent money like a prairie fire had
friends from here to yonder-every-
thing by george it was worth the
price just to watch him then one day
the rich uncle got wind of his ways and
cut him off without a cent

  so he dropped said dapper glanc-
ing again toward the figure beneath the
shop eaves the man had turned now
and was passing into bonis

  well said vaughan it didnt look
as if he meant to drop it looked as if

- by george it looked as if it had

sort of sobered him up and set him to
work but there was a girl somewhere

that-

  dapper looked up

  there was a girl back where he
lived he had her picture in his watch
and i remember he had sent her a ring
-a corker well right on the heels of

the uncles little stunt-right on top of
it-the ring came back

  dapper shook his head cant blame
the girl he said

  i do blame her answered vaughan
letting go like a turtle soons it thun-
dered might have held on to see if
there was anything in him but no
and so when i asked him once why
he didnt go back he sort of laughed
and said go back-to what  and so
he drifts poor devil but the tide doesnt
seem strong enough to carry him away
from here wish youd heard that bis-
marck

  now it happened that the bed on
which dapper sat was placed alongside
the window at which he had been stand-
ing from this window there was a
view of the sidewalk opposite and
down that sidewalk passed at this very
instant-boadicea

  if the reader has gathered that miss
hodge was old or hideous or in any
way repellent to the eye he has leaped
at unwarrantable conclusions she was
tall which was rather unwise of her
and she was about twenty-four she
had a broad forehead and she brushed
her hair back from it without curl or
compromise

  her eyes were gray and very clear
she looked straight at you with no
dropping of the lashes appearing to
weigh what you were saying and to be
thoughtful of her own answers an at-
titude rather disconcerting in light con-
versation and society conversation as
every one knows is seldom anything
but light so boadicea being a weight
upon its ambient waves sank she
sank down down fathoms down she
was unpopular when a girl contracts
this affliction there is nothing for it but
a change of climate

  however miss hodge did not care to
change she liked this climate very
well a little rainy at times but one
could always wear overshoes and she
bowed from beneath her umbrella to
the sad young man who stood watching
her from his window

  found anybody for her yet asked
vaughan
cboacdicea and the green elephants



 dapper turned on him savagely

suppose you-

 thanks i told you this morning
id like to oblige you considering the
bath slippers but ive had a date since
last year shes been down to kerri-
gans to match the fringe for her dress
its pink this year

  shes all ready of course groaned
dapper and nobodys asked her
yet

  auglian laughed nobody ever
asks her until the last minute hear
the sleet there comes abbott out of
bonis wonder if hes heard about
bismarck 

 dapper said nothing suddenly he
started up call him he cried
quickly i want to see him

 vaughan opened the window and
called the man closing the door of
the chili shop looked about him pres-
ently he saw the two at the window and
crossed the street his shoulders stooped
beneath the pelting rain

 vaughan closed the sash then he
turned apprehensively

 what are you up to he asked
hes not a green elephant

  he shall be one said dapper and
youre going to stay by me in it too
then he opened the door hello ab-
bott he said cordially come in
and he pushed forward one of his two
chairs which the newcomer drew
nearer the fire

 smoke asked dapper the other
declined

 its plain you havent heard the
news and dapper took the remaining
chair as he crammed his pipe

 the news asked abbott

 about bismarck i mean

 abbott smiled whimsically oh
yes i heard

 good thing that said dapper
universitys proud of you

  well said abbott in his slow way
i wrote that before i came to the uni-
versity happened to find it and
thought id hand it in

 i see whenever you did it its
good and thats what  wanted to see
you about dapper examined his pipe
bowl then he added quite simply

    

youve been elected to membership in
the green elephants

  vaughan rose suddenly from his seat
on the table and walked back to the
window

  dapper went on i think you realize

that we do no- he hesitated

the green elephants do no-

	proselyting suggested abbott
with his slow smile

  well yes however in your case
its different we want members who
do things ill speak out straight
dapper laid his pipe on the table and
looked the visitor in the eye we want
the distinction of having you for a
member

  are you quite certain its a distinc-
tion  asked abbott presently have
you by any chance read the effusion
you mention 

  i know what the faculty have said
answered dapper thats enough

  i appreciate the honor said ab-
bott gravely and the fact that i am
entirely unable to accept it does not
lessen the obligation it confers

  dapper made a mental note of this
little speech it would come in handy
some time he felt sure if you mean

- he began gently aloud

  i mean im broke said abbott
harshly flat broke t thought you
knew i thought everybody knew i
dont deserve membership in anything
on the ground you mention the paper
was nothing-an accident but you fel
lows-its decent of you im-im
much obliged

  pte rose pushing his chair in place
with a fumbling hand

  as for the financial obligations
said dapper whenever the society so-
licits a member-which is rare-it ac-
cepts no dues of any sort

  abbott favored him with a look-a
long look from dark slow-moving eyes

  aint that right vaughan dap-
per added in rather a warning tone

  right-o said vaughan at the win-
dow

 now what we want you to do
hastened dapper is to wake up to get
out of yourself then casually you


smiths magazine

shall we start the grand narch

they are waiting murmured florine

are to come to the german to-morrow
night as a starter

  abbott broke in with his low stum-
bling laugh now i know youre jok-
ing- he said

  joking from dapper why if
you dont show up at the german i
dont know what the societyll think
if i do show up theyll change their
minds about my being a distinction i
can tell you that he laughed a sud-
den laugh that grated  dappers
nerves no well cut out the ger-
mans but im much obliged

  look here said dapper ive got
a dress suit you can have if thats

whats stopping you there it is-on
the bed itll fit you all right if it
dont-take it to the tailor whatever
else you need go to kerrigans and get
it charge it to me why man the
society authorizes me to get you in at
any price

  my stock has risen overnight said
abbott after a moment

  and heres ten dollars for roses or
whatever you select for my part i
like roses you know weve got a girl
for you

  it was the pinnacle to which dapper
had so laboriously ascended who could
guess from his casual-almost careless
boadice and the gcreen elephants

 

tone that his head was whirling with
the height with the sickening fear that
the rain-battered man before him would
open the door and go leaving him lying
amid the rocks from which he had
climbed 

  abbotts eyes clouded shifted fell
im not going he said in a low voice
i tell you well cut out the-the social
side of it im much obliged

  w hy man cried dapper desper-
ately i never thought of your refus-
ing i told her-and shes expecting
you

  -whats her name in the same low
beaten tone

  hodge answered dapper faintly
miss winnie hodge

  i know her father said abbott
hes failed me twice

  well the girl likes you all right
dapper laughed almost boisterously
dont she vaughan

 shame on you said vaughan
without turning

  im not sure said abbott looking
from one to the other of them whether
youre trying to make a fool of me or
to find out if im one already
forget it man forget it soothed
dapper and he lifted the bill from the
table and laid it in abbotts hand

  abbott spoke after a moment there
was something like apology in his voice
its hard to believe anythings genu-
ine after a time he said even-
even a treat then he folded the bill
carefully i suppose he added id
better call there to-night-on miss
hodge ive never met lief you know
no said dapper in a panic its
not necessary fact is she has some
sort of engagement for to-night shell
understand

  he folded the dress suit and pressed
it into abbotts arms the tailor-
my account-kerrigans-anything you
want he mumbled rapidly closing
with a fervent god bless you  a form
of adieu that dapper had never em-
ployed before

  when the door had closed on the vis-
itor dapper sank into a chair any-
thing i can do asked vaughan

  go by the express office shouted

the president and see if those favors
have come hanged if i know what
that committees thinking about

  alone he went to the mirror and
seizing his brushes began rhythmically
to smooth back his hair he was culti-
vating a pompadour all for you
florine he breathed to the lady in the
silver frame before him all for
you

  whether he meant the pompadour or
the things he had been telling abbott
florine did not inquire she merely
smiled back inscrutably after the man-
ner of mona lisa and all lesser sisters
who are having their pictures made

  tt was the next night to be exact
it was that tense moment when dapper
was midway in the ritual of his white
tie

  the door opened without preliminary
knock and abbott entered he wore
the regalia-of full dress even to a
flower in the buttonhole his face was
darkly flushed his eyes burning for
a full breath he did not speak but stood
his back against the door his flaming
eyes on dapper

  you drunk demanded the object
of this scrutiny then more amiably
whats the matter

  matter repeated abbott through
clenched teeth what sort of games
this youve been playing

  game 

  yes game electing me to your old
society when youve never been able to
see me on the street calling it a dis-
tinction and all that rot-proselyting-
so you could use me for work you
wouldnt do yourself

  dapper facing him fumbled with his
tie i dont know what you mean he
said

  i know what you mean i thought
it was out of pity you took me in i
thought in the beginning it was some
fool joke it never occurred to me that
you were hiring me-yes hiring me
and without my knowledge-to take a
girl nobody else would take-that some-
body had to take why couldnt you
tell me what you wanted  why
couldnt you play straight


smiths magazine

  whos been telling you this rot
asked dapper

  telling me i heard em talking on
the street i was on my way to her
house-like the fool i was they dont
want me in it they were howling-but
they appreciate your predicament gets
harder every year girls deucedly ex-
pensive could have built us a club-
house on what shes cost us all told
then they laughed why shouldnt
they laugh the jokes fine

  good lord mumbled dapper pi-
ously and began to brush his pompa
dour

  yes said abbott the jokes fine
but its not finished thats what im
here for to finish it

  he peeled off the dress coat and
stood facing dapper as if prepared for
an even more intimate encounter
when he began however rapidly to
unbutton the white vest dappers alarm
grew desperate

  here man he cried clutching this
second garment and holding it together
in sudden frenzy cant you see its
too late now  i phoned the girl yes-
terday-shes waiting for you think
of the girl man think of the girl
and he stood gripping the lapels of the
vest and gazing imploringly into ab-
botts eyes

  abbott shook him off as if he had
been an overattentive poodle you
can phone her again he remarked
you can tell her im suddenly ill the
gentle art of fabrication is apparently
not unknown to you as to your
clothes it occurs to me that i must take
your advice  should probably be ar
rested if i went away without a few of
them he rebuttoned the vest the
money you lent me i would return now
but as it happens  have spent it

  ill take the roses and call it
square growled dapper

  unfortunately i didnt invest in
roses you failed to specify roses defi-
nitely if you will remember so i paid
the money to boni i owed it how-
ever you shall not go unpaid he
opened the door adjusting the lapels of
the dress coat with a certain rigorous
nicety perhaps some one else will be

thoughtful enough to hire me-who
knows 

  dapper made a final lurch for his
dignity

  i am sorry- he began but the

door banged suddenly upon his words
he flung the hairbrush upon the floor
its fall drowned the remark he made
which was just as well the landlady
in the next room was accustomed to
things dropping around the house but
as she had wearily explained there
was some words as no lady could
bear

  now i suppose ive got to phone
said dapper and he kicked the hair-
brush under the washstand then he
went downstairs his tie dangling

  boadicea answered the call herself

  sick why i thought i saw him
only a little while ago in kerrigans

  hes been taken suddenly he has
attacks

  has what

  attacks

  oh im sorry  read his paper
on bismarck father says hes a gen-
ius

 h-m-m-m-m maybe so some-
things the matter with him anyway
he asked me to let you know im
sorry too i-dapper swallowed
bravely-i wanted a dance

  then he fled as if he feared she
would hook him with the telephone re-
ceiver

  had any green elephant striven for
boadicea as he had striven  had any
met with so ignominious a defeat he
had conceived a scheme machiavellian
had blazed a trail for all other panic-
stricken presidents only to see its frui-
tion crumble at a touch

  and they had betrayed him in the
first place they had refused to help
him then when he had fought his own
way out they had laughed and betrayed
him-him their president and what
in thunder were they laughing at he
hadnt contrived the thing for their
amusement and why abbott should

get so thundering mad- the man

was a fool

  he hadnt told him what he wanted
because he preferred to spare his feel-
boadicea an the green elephants



she came into that room with her soft dress trailing about her and her long cloak falling from her
                           shoulders her face so beautiful so kind-

ings all right the game was up
boadicea could stay at home the bi-
exam could go hang as for dapper
he was going to lead that german with
florine fie had forgotten all about
the cyanide of potassium

  the tie was not a success but the
hour was late and clapping on his top
hat with undapperlike brevity he
dragged on his coat snatched up a
florists box and leaping downstairs
slid into the waiting carriage

colonel shaws he said quick
now florine was blue-eyed and radi-
ant-haired she had all the softness
all the playful purring prettiness of a

white kitten in her presence what
man could brood on the annoyances of
a boadicea  riding with her dapper
was in a heaven of supreme oblivion to
all outside the carriage doors

  leaping from his seat lest a lackey
serve her first he lifted his lady to the
step gazing a rapturously possessive
moment upon her satined and spangled
beauty folded in swans-down then
they passed into the lighted doors of the
ballroom

  on the threshold dapper gasped
drew back florine turned her starry
eyes to his it is nothing he said
nothing at all and they went on but


smiths magazine

dapper had seen more than a vision
and he glanced back twice to make sure

  in the corner riot far from the door
neath the shade of the sheltering palms
sat ernest abbott and boadicea he
was looking at her program making
what might have been crossmarks
upon it she was watching him as she
drew on her gloves boadicea always
drew on her gloves in the ballroom
rather laboriously she appeared to
dislike gloves

 what powerful arms she has
thought dapper and great heaven
he had told her he wanted a dance
how reckless of him how unneces-
sary but then everything was going
wrong to-night

  they are waiting murmured flo-
rine shall we start the grand
march  so the german began

  after supper dapper moved halting-
ly from balcony to palm and along the
chairs in the ballroom where the wall-
flowers usually bloomed he meant to
give boadicea that dance he had said
he would and he meant to stay by it
there was nothing mean about dapper

  but boadicea was not to be found
perhaps she had left early he had not
seen abbott rushing her program
well that at least was not his fault
and he drew a long breath and went
back to florine

  but boadicea had not gone home on
the way downstairs she appeared sud-
denly by his side and said good night

  it was a beautiful german she
added

  dapper thanked her tranquilly he
thought himself that it had been a beau-
tiful german and already boadicea
was the burden of the next president

  yet he was to feel her weight again
not her weight indeed but that after-
ache that sometimes follows when a
burden has been laid aside

  it was a month later vaughan was
in dappers room his feet on the table
a book in his hand dapper was bend-
ing a profound scowl on a page of
 -ivy he had skinned through on bi
but here was lat verily man is of
few days and full of trouble it was a

glorious day outside a day of white
sunlight with an icy tang in the air a
day for a gallop across the hills

  a knock at the door a firm rapid
knock

  come in  muttered dapper

  and in walked ernest abbott

  he looked like the day outside
there was a buoyancy about him a
glow-something glad and fresh and
new was it the clothes he wore 
they were irreproachable dapper con-
ceded that and rose reverently
vaughan shifted his feet and shut his
book

  abbott laid a bundle  the table

  im sorry i forgot to return these
he said its the suit you lent me the
bill at kerrigans in your name i have
paid the carriage that night i didnt
use for the loan of the ten dollars-
he laid a bill on the table-i am very-
much obliged

   dont understand said dapper
you know these were not loans even
if you regard them as a br-as pay-
ment you did your part you earned
them

  thats it exactly said abbott
quietly i did not earn them i re-
fused them on the conditions they had
been offered upon and went home
that closed the deal

  but- began dapper vaguely

he was fingering the bill rather glad to
get it back but averse to giving it an
open welcome

  i went i am aware finished ab-
bott but  didnt take the young lady
she took me she came in her carriage
and got me

  dapper glanced at him and smiled
vaughan shook with laughter

  the incident is  doubt amusing
said abbott reflectively he turned to
dapper you had told her that i was
ill that i had-attacks she had seen
me sometimes at bonis she had gath-
ered that i was-down and out it
wasnt hard to see was it she thought
that night its the blues thats what it
is and she came yon see yrou were
not far wrong i do have-attacks
and she was right too in her surmise
of what they were he stopped
boadicea anfd the gcreen elephants



then suddenly if you had been sin-
gled out as a thing so mean-so
wretched-

  oh it wasnt that bad said dap-
per

  you might have had an attack too
i left you you remember wearing your
clothes and came home i didnt go up
to my room there are times-there
were times-when i didnt dare be
alone anyhow i was downstairs in
the hall cold as it was i had thrown
off the coat again-i couldnt bear the
feel of it-and i sat  the sofa looking
into the dying coals and listening to the
carriages as they rolled past to the
ball

  cinderella the second murmured
vaughan

 yes-only worse then suddenly
one of the carriages stopped i heard it
scrape the curb and a moment later the
door opened softly and she came in
i had seen her before not knowing who
she was i had thought only that she
was very tall but now she came into
that room with her soft dress trailing
about her and her long cloak falling
from her shoulders her face so beauti-
ful so kind-

 he stopped a minute vaughan
looked at dapper he was not laugh-
ing now dapper was fingering the
money still folding and unfolding it
without looking up

  i cant tell you how it happened but
another minute and she was sitting be-
side me in the cold she is not tall you
know when you see her close it is the
way she carries herself she sat down
there on the little worn sofa beside the
fire

  i am winnie hodge she said
and i want you to come with me no
matter how you feel it will do you
good

  and all i could think of was i
dont care for parties

   i dont either she answered but
my father is unhappy when i am left
out and the boys have worked so
hard to get me there they like to keep
him in a good humor 

 vaughan and dapper exchanged a
quick glance that was like a shout

   i go for his sake she said you
must come for mine and then as i
didnt move she added very softly
arent we a little alike we two  and
yet in our loneliness we can manage a
little-that our shadow does not fall on
some one else that was all she was
thinking of her father

  well sir i got up as if i worked by
a spring she lifted the coat from
where i had flung it and helped me into
it she has strong arms but how gen-
tle i what could a man not face for
a woman like that  with others he
might drift-over the precipice per-
haps with her if he let fall the oars
she would take them up and row him in

  to think of her being hawked about
year after year  to think of men being
bribed-you started to use the word
yourself a minute ago-bribed to let her
go with them-to dance with her and
she knew-she knew it all the time and
went-and smiled-lest her shadow fall
on some one else

  he looked from one to the other
dapper put the bill in his vest pocket
there was silence

  i came home that night and wrote
i wrote till it was light outside she
had asked me to i gave the thing to
her-it was nothing she sent it away
she asked for my other things i
scraped them together she typed
them and they went off too thats
how it happens  can pay you they
sold ive accepted an offer from the
editor of holts its all her work i
wanted you to know we leave to-
night for new york

  we it was vaughan who put the
question

  winifred and i we were married
an hour ago

  dapper had been standing and he sat
down

  i congratulate you said vaughan
rising abbott gripped his hand dap-
per looked up-extended his own ten-
tatively the husband of boadicea
might not care to see it but abbott
seized it without reserve

  it was you he said it was you
who gave her to me he paused hesi-
tated laughed shortly there is one


smiths magazine

other thing i hadnt meant to tell you
-but id like you to know the whole
of what youve done for me and if
ever i can be of any service-you un-
derstand

  that day in front of bonis-the
day you fellows called me up here-it
was all up with me out there in the
rain t had just made up my mind the
thing doesnt take courage as people
seem to think its when our courage is
all gone that the decision comes

  well i went in out of the rain and
gave boni a ring-a little ring i had
managed to hold on to through every-
thing  didnt owe him that much-
but hed been my friend and somehow
i couldnt do the thing comfortably
without settling up with him by the
way your ten dollars got it back-the
ring i mean-and it met-a happier
fate i had just come out of bonis
and was making for the drug store

- he stopped laughed again

sounds funny telling it he remarked

  but dapper breathed hoarsely cya-
nide of potassium

  abbott started laughed again
howd you know well its the sim-
plest route if youre going to take any
besides id pawned the gun anyhow
i didnt get it you called me and i
came up and then-you gave her to
me thats all i mean to remember
good-by

  good-by they echoed and he was
gone there followed the sounds of
wheels departing they went to the
window it was boadiceas carriage on
its way to the train

 do you know said vaughan
thoughtfully i have always had a
lurking suspicion that we didnt appre-
ciate boadicea

  dapper turned on him savagely
appreciate her or not ive worried my
ears off over her then after a pause
slowly but-what do you know about
abbott 

  well said vaughan taking up his
book and returning his feet to their
former eminence i think we may safe-
ly assume hes resigned from the green
elephants

               the wanderer

 i ost a foolish heart that needs must go a-straying

    down the fern-fringed byway through the pine-dusk dim unrolled
 to the stretch of open meadow and the gypsy children playing

 and far beyond the alder tops the sunsets gleam of gold

 lost a foolish heart that lingered close and listened

 to the chance-flung gypsy jargon by the twilight-kindled fire

 while the bangles of the women in the red light caught and glistened
 and the night wind in the pine tops pleaded sweet of old desire

 heard the rattle of the headstalls and the gypsy ponies stamping

 glimpsed against the darkness the firelight-flickered tents

 sensed the thousand sights and sounds that loiter round the camping
 breathed the fir-sweet wood smoke and the brooding hemlock scents

 lost a foolish heart that strayed across the heather

 loitered down the hemlock glade and threaded through the fern
 needs must go a-faring in the may-white wander weather

 and found a gypsy caravan chance-set beside the turn

except in the eyes of aline emer-
son goring did not look like a
person capable of ending any sort
of a reign of terror even the small one
that thrilled dempster falls during the
winter of 

  he was a tall young man but scarcely
as broad as his length warranted  and
less heroic still his garments shared this
peculiarity of his breadth and always
seemed too short and scant he had a
shock of stiff unruly blond hair that
was always standing bolt upright from
his forehead as if in surprised protest
at the things his eager spectacled blue
eyes beheld in the world how shock-
ing these things were one had only to
read the columns of his brothers
struggling little paper the dempster
mercury to know

  elmer goring had come to dempster
falls at his brothers call for help
george the elder had settled in that
prosperous manufacturing city some ten
years earlier had married a blooming
country girl from the hills outside the
town had accumulated half a dozen
children and a moribund weekly which
he promptly changed into a daily still
threatened to be sure with dissolution
on account of its failure to meet ex-
penses but no longer afflicted by auto-
paralysis

  day after day week after week the
mercury thundered in juvenalian tones
and terms against the political corrup-
tion which it declared was eating the

heart out of dempster falls then
suddenly at the end of the ten years
physicians whom george goring at first
firmly believed to be in league with the
municipal powers of evil told him that
he must drop his work and go to ari-
zona unless he desired to die within
three months

  ernestina his wife had allowed him
no choice in the matter or he might
have chosen to stay in dempster falls
to test the truth of the decree and to
die in harness the gorings were cast in
fanatic mold but when george ob-
jected to his wife that his life work
must inevitably be lost if he was obliged
to leave the mercury in the hands of his
few subordinates-for he was not only
proprietor but managing editor edi-
torial writer business manager and
city hall and police reporter-she bade
him send for elmer

  georges summons found elmer
eking out a somewhat hungry journal-
istic existence in chicago to which spot
he had drifted from the newspaper of-
fice in michigan where he had served
his varied apprenticeship he re-
sponded with an alacrity prompted
equally by strong family feeling and in-
tense love of an idealistic battle for
george had told him that dempster
falls was in the midst of a reign of
terror and that the carnival of
vice could be ended only by the un-
ceasing vigilance and the undaunted at-
tacks of the dempster mercury


smiths magazine

  it was a prospect not to be rivaled in
charm for elmer and he arrived full of
enthusiasm to be carefully coached by
ieorge in all the details of that car-
nival and that reign in the midst of
which george was as a voice crying in
the wilderness

  to a less heroic soul the fact that
he almost immediately met aline emer-
son and fell entirely hopelessly and
overwhelmingly in love with her might
have been saddening for according to
george the very bulwark of civic cor-
ruption in dempster falls was alines
father its perpetually reelected mayor

  old joe emerson george had sol-
emnly instructed his substitute was the
dragon at which the st george of the
mercury office must forever tilt dis-
daining humbler though more obvious
enemies not the police commissioner
not the chief of police not the detective
bureau not the board of aldermen-
though all these were in truth vicious
and dishonest as seen by editor goring
-were to be assailed but the mayor
whose creatures they were whose bid-
dings they performed and whose re-
wards they received

  to elmer goring however the fact
of falling in love with aline emerson
only gave strength to that doughty
sword arm of his he is thrice strong
who knows his weakness elmer per-
ceiving love for his enemys daughter
as a weakness probably designed by the
evil one to render him false to his
brothers charge and to his own con-
victions redoubled his attacks upon the
mayor unconsciously elmer had al-
ways wanted to be a martyr and here
was a glorious martyrdom offered to
him-to crucify the longings of his
heart for the sake of right and truth
and brotherhood all in the largest-
sized capitals

 aline  who was handsome and
healthy earnest and intelligent prided
herself upon being also modern it
seemed to her that nothing could be
more modern than for her to fall in
love with her fathers opponent--quite
forgetting that the thing had been done
since the days of the capulets and mon-
tagues and probably long before at

any rate fall in love with him she did
how she contrived without sacrifice
of traditional feminine decorum to let
him know the fact has nothing to do
with the story how she contrived to
win her mothers consent to the engage-
ment is easily told  it was a mere mat-
ter of a tall fresh-colored wholesome
self-assured and dominant young ladys
bullying a fidgety little self-distrustful
old one but there was nothing new
in that for aline had always bullied
her mother in the perfectly good af-
fectionate american fashion from her
cradle

  the question of winning her fathers
consent was naturally somewhat more
complicated but the mayor of demp-
ster falls was not in charge of his
bailiwick when all these things occurred
he had broken a record for indomita-
ble hardiness by falling ill just a little
before george goring went to arizona
and when he fell ill he did it thor-
oughly making up for much lost time

  there had been consultations of phy-
sicians and surgeons at his bedside
there had been a series of extensive and
expensive operations and finally there
had been a decree of banishment for six
months when the reign of terror
and elmer goring simultaneously
struck dempster falls the mayor had
been a month absent from city hall and
when aline coerced her mother into re-
ceiving the awkward badly dressed
young enthusiast as her fiance four
months of the mayors exile had passed

  tt will be perhaps noted that demp-
sters reign of terror is described as
coincident with mayor emersons ab-
sence from his office at first glance
this might seem to prove the falsity of
charges against the mayor of misap-
prehension in regard to his commerce
with the underworld of the city over
which he ruled but such a conclusion
could never be reached by the well-
instructed readers of the mercury

  the mayor it was admitted-even
pointed out by that sheet-was too intel-
ligent a man to permit the perfect riot
of robbery and of unveiled disorder
which his lieutenants no longer guided
by his intelligence permitted they so
goring envs the reign of terrocr	

the roar of a train approaching the bridge drowned the sound of the steps behind him

said the mercury took the lid off but
it was the mayor who had permitted
the seething mass of offense to brew un-
der cover while he was at home

  the particular fresh manifestation of
the criminal spirit to which the mer-
cury had reference was the sudden in-
crease of burglary and highway rob-
bery within the confines of dempster
falls a police long paralyzed by delib-
erate indifference and laxity in regard
to slightly more subtle forms of crime

found themselves totally unable to cope
with the new situation-such was the
mercurys explanation of the fact that
house after house had been robbed and
no successful clew to the robbers dis-
covered  that whoever rode upon the
street cars or walked upon the streets
after nightfall was likely to return to
his home minus his watch or his wallet

  it was not all the mere sensation
mongering of a disgruntled newspaper
even the prosperous sheets of the town


smiths magazine

even those that belonged to the political
ring that had so long ruled the destinies
of dempster falls were obliged to re-
port the succession of outrages were
obliged to comment upon the unsafe
condition of the streets so many
women were robbed that only the direst
necessity induced one of them to go out
unaccompanied at night citizens be-
gan demanding to be sworn in as deputy
sheriffs in order that they might legally
carry firearms with which to protect
themselves

  things were in a very sad condition
indeed for every one except the editor
pro tem of the mercury when finally
the six months of the mayors banish-
ment were over and he returned to his

 own realm to strike fear into the hearts
 of his lieutenants by his criticism of
 their mismanagement of affairs during
 his absence to chill his wifes blood
 with dread of what he would say to her
 concerning alines engagement and
 even to give that sprightly girl herself a
 few minutes of trepidation in thinking
 what was before her

   she however comforted herself with
 a reflection that her mother was unable
 to make-namely that we live in a
 modern world that we are moderns
 and that the tyranny of parents is
 merely a quaint survival of the antique
 even when mayor emerson showed his

 	total lack of appreciation of the require-
 ments of modernity by refusing to see
 elmer goring and by threatening him
 in a typewritten note with a suit for
 trespass and various other things
 should he ever dare to set foot upon
 the emerson acres again her belief was
 not entirely shaken

 so much by way of prologue now
 for the story

   elmer was the last
 person to leave the
 mercury office that
 night he had seen
 the copics of the
 early-morning edition
 on the wagon that
 carried them to the
 railway station he
 had received from the
 hands of a faithful
 newsboy the first edi-
 tions of the papers
 that he called his ri-
 vals thereby in their
 opinion greatly flat-
 tering himself he
 h a d congratulated
 himself upon a new
 feature that he had
 introduced into the
 mercury in a half
 column of the front
 page where certain
 of his contemporaries
 printed a resume of
 the days news he
 printed a resume of

elmer sat down suddenly in front of it and stared
goring envs the reign of teor



the clays crimes in dempster falls and
not a child was robbed by a larger child
of his penny for candy or of his nickel
for bread without due notice being
given in the mercury

  that the mercurys circulation was
growing under this policy was he as-
sured himself much less important to
him than that the city was waking up
to its condition there had been a cit-
izens meeting of protest that very
night which he had attended in the
twofold capacity of speaker and re-
porter

  altogether as he slammed his desk
cover down upon a heterogeneous mass
of copy paper proofs and police re-
ports snapped out the electric light
and made his way down through the
dusty and disorderly silence of the of-
fice to the street he was rather well
pleased with himself

  the mercury office was in that region
of dempster falls locally known as
across the tracks the mercury had
never been rich enough to follow its
contemporaries out of this old un-
kempt badly paved badly lighted sec-
tion of the city to the brilliant new
center the district was known as al-
derman flynns except for the mcr-
citry offices a few lumber yards and
a few warehouses the industries of the
locality seemed to be concentrated in
the grogshops alderman flynn was
a wholesale dealer in spirits which may
have had something to do with the fa-
vorite occupation of his ward

 elmer walked along rather slowly
when he first left the office after the
heat and the vitiated air of the print-
ing establishment the cool night winds
were restful to him no one else seemed
to he abroad in the dark dingy streets
and he went along peacefully thinking
a lovers night thoughts

 suddenly he heard behind him a
heavy but rapid tread he was ap-
proaching a great arch of stone and
brick over which was built a railroad
bridge he was not deeply interested
in the fact that some one else was
abroad at half past two on the dark
winter morning ffe was thinking of
aline and the splendid bravery of her

  dark eyes and the inspiring courage of
her words when the- had met that day
for a moment in the library and also
-he was human though the champion
of a cause-of the way in which her
hair curled about her ears and her neck

  the roar of a train approaching the
bridge drowned the sound of the steps
behind him he had just turned into
the dark arch and was crouching a lit-
tle toward one side to escape the sudden
gust of wind that met him as he turned
when his follower caught up with him
brushed against him and strode ahead
through the darkness of the tunnel

  for half a second he thought nothing
of the jostle-the wind was sudden
and strong from the direction that he
faced and any one might crowd another
in bending before it but as the figure
emerged into the light of a street lamp
beyond the tunnel elmer seemed sud-
denly to recognize it stout tall alert
well dressed-it was the very figure
that one of the victims of a holdup
had described in that evenings meeting
as belonging to the gentleman who had
recently taken from him his well-filled
wallet at the point of a pistol

  elmers wallet was not well filled  it
was most unlikely to be at any time an
object of attack but he put his hand
quickly toward the pocket in which he
carried his watch it was gone

  elmer quickened his pace broke into
a run lie did not stop to reflect upon
the physical disparity between him and
the man whom he was pursuing he
was merely angry merely meant to
have his watch back not only was it
a good watch but it had been his
fathers presented by the men of his
fathers regiment upon their disbanding
at the close of the civil war he had
not the slightest intention of losing that
watch

  it seemed to him that as he ran
the figure ahead quickened its pace it
did not however either take ignomini-
ously to its heels or disappear in any
of the dark little houses of the street or
escape in the open littered lots that di-
vided them panting for he was no
sprinter he caught up with it at last
just as it turned to face him


smiths magazine

 give me that watch you-you
breathlessly demanded elmer enforcing
the command by the display of the re-
volver that he was carrying and
come along with me he added as his
wind returned

  the overtaken thief complied with
the request to the extent of handing
over the watch but he twisted elmers
hand from his shoulder in such a way
as almost to sprain the wrist the pis-
tol fell clattering to the ground and the
big man was oft on a run with an agil-
ity surprising in a person of his build

  elmer was in no condition to follow
he had to be content with the recovery
of his watch he walked home more
slowly pondering upon the amusing
fact that the thief had seemed better
dressed than he the upright citizen he
would lay the case before the police in
the morning it wasnt worth while to
try to start them out to-night especially
since he had his watch

  he climbed the stairs to his room in
his lodging house a dim light burned
in the hall outside his door he was a
favorite with his landlady and this was
a mark of her regard he went into
his room lit the gas beside the bureau
and the first object upon which his eyes
lighted was his fathers watch ticking
peacefully upon the hook of an absurd
little frame that his sister bessie had
given him the christmas before the
melodiously ticking chronometer regis-
tered two-fifty oclock elmer sat down
suddenly in front of it and stared

  by and by he drew the other watch
from his pocket he let it lie in the
hollow of his hand and stared at
it it was undoubtedly an excellent
and expensive watch of which he had
that night robbed a harmless pedestrian
under the railway bridge in alderman
flynns seventh ward

  he sat still for a few minutes men-
tally cursing the absent-mindedness that
continually drove him to leave his
house not entirely clad-minus hand-
kerchief gloves even necktie-or with-
out his watch or his important papers
or his money and then he spent an-
other imprecation upon his tricky fancy
which had convinced him that he had

  looked at that very watch of his fathers
live minutes before leaving the office
it must of course have been the office
clock

  a sudden hope leaped up in him
perhaps this watch also bore inscrip-
tions by which its owner could be im-
mediately traced without the interven-
tion of jewelers and their records but
there was no inscription not even a
monogram anywhere about the full-
jevvelejl eighteen-carat bauble which
now burned the hand that held it well
there was nothing for it but to make a
round of the jewelers establishments
in the morning and to try to discover
to whom they had sold the excellent
timepiece on the noncommittal black
fob so like his own

  and then he thought how the robbed
and plundered citizen might have al-
ready lodged a complaint against him
with a description and how even now
vengeance might be upon his trail he
had been in dempster falls only six
months he had incurred powerful en-
mities made few friends memories of
the various raffles of fiction of whom
he had read occurred to him and a cold
sweat bedewed his brow dempster
falls had many eminent citizens who
would rejoice to see in him another
gentleman highwayman

 mayor emerson although he had
been out late the night before appeared
early at his breakfast table in answer
to his wifes inquiries he said that he
had finally seen flynn the night before
and he volunteered the information that
flynn was a shortsighted fool he
also instructed the waitress to reach the
police commissioner for him by tele-
phone whether that gentleman was at
home or in his office where he should
be said the mayor viciously attacking
his grapefruit

  when the police commissioner was
found and was reported to be at the
other end of the wire the mayor pro-
ceeded to address him and there be-
ing no one present but the wife of his
bosom he spoke his mind freely

  youve let things get away from
you in fine shape he informed his aid
goring ends the reign of terror



feverishly protesting that he would never cease to give battle to the
forces of evil

here i come back
to find a full-btast
campaign against
the administration
with everything to
back it up for once

and as if that
werent enough i
cant go downtown
of an evening to con-
sult with one of the
crowd but what t get
held up and robbed on
my way home im not
only going to lose my
office on account of
these blamed highway
robberies youve let get
away from you but
ive got to lose my
watch as well

  pretty situation
aint it  what do you
think of yourself

have it for me again
w i t h i n twenty-four
hours will you just
let the people hear that
and this administration
will have a blacker eye
than ever the police
know enough of the
thieves to find the
mayors watch but not
other peoples hard-
ly never mind about
the watch but this
things got to stop do
you get me its got
to stop and the
mayor returned to the
bacon and eggs which
had by that time reached the table

  so it happened that by the time el-
mer goring had discovered the owner
of the watch that he had seized from a
defenseless man at the point of the pis-
tol the edict had gone forth members
of the light-fingered gentry had been in-
structed to take the first trains out of
dempster falls a few of those who
presumed to regard the order as a pleas-
antry and to test it by a little further
work in their chosen line soon found
themselves proving its authenticity by

serving terms in jail the harvest was
over

  it took elmer goring two days to
trace the ownership of the watch they
had been two days of misery in which
he had awaited the clap of the hand of
the law upon his shoulder in which he
had not seen aline and in which he
was quite unable to put his usual force
into his daily invectives against the mu-
nicipal officers nor was his situation
bettered when on the afternoon of the
second day he discovered by a double


smiths magazine

coincidence that the man he had robbed
was mayor emerson

  the fact was proved not only by the
records upon a jewelers books but also
by elmers attendance at a hearing of
the board of estimate and apportion-
ment at which the mayor presided
valiant a spirit as he was he could not
run the awful risk of remaining in the
council chamber to report the proceed-
ings  he hurried back to the office and
sent one of his few subordinates to
cover the meeting

 when the mayor was summoned
from his comfortable dinner to receive
the suitor for his daughters hand that
evening he obeyed the summons explo-
sively noisily tyrannically nothing
less modern than his attitude could be
imagined as aline with regretful su-
periority observed

  but when the storm of abusive in-
quiry with which the old-fashioned
master of the house saw fit to greet
goring had subsided the mayor was
rendered entirely speechless by having
his caller dangle before his eyes his
watch upon its black silk fob aston-
ishment having deprived him of the
power of speech for a few minutes el-
mer had a chance to make his explana-
tion

  the mayor was an intelligent man
as his less intelligent lieutenants knew
he was not without a sense of humor
also a grim smile curved his smooth-

shaven lips at the close of elmers re-
cital

  i dare say there are a lot of people
in this town who would swear that you
were not so far wrong when you took
me for a thief he observed without
bitterness but you were wrong you
see and they are wrong it was an
amusing blunder i hope you will also
find it an instructive one

  the mayor rose to signify that the
interview was ended but he reckoned
without the modern aline who entered
the drawing-room and informed him
that this was as good a time as any
to let him understand that -his anti-
quated notions of the connection be-
tween private and political life were
passe superseded by a new code

  besides she said im not at all
sure that it wouldnt be good politics
for you to let me marry the editor of
the mercury with your consent of
course-negligently-im going to
marry him but  really think that
your consent would be good politics

  the mayor looked at her with some
admiration thats not such a bad
idea lie said

  and across elmer goring elatedly
seizing aline by the hands and fever-
ishly protesting that he would never
cease to give battle to the forces of
evil but that it would be the system
not the man that he would attack the
mayor and aline smiled a compact

when mrs armbruster hurried
to the door in answer to the
sharp rattle of the electric bell
hastily untying her apron and tossing it
over a faded sofa in the back parlor
she was fervently hoping that she
would face an applicant for the second
floor back

  tt had been empty for three weeks
since madame merrill the snake
charmer had suddenly vacated it with
her rent live weeks in arrears and noth-
ing for mrs armbruster to hold but
seven full-sized snakes it had taken
less than an instant for the landlady
to decide that holding them was out of
her line and she had allowed the ser-
pent queen to go her way with a little
hopeless sigh for the fifteen dollars she
would never see

  every summons of the bell thereafter
was a feeble harbinger of hope which
fled to the four winds invariably when
she opened the door to confront the gas
collector or the young man from the
butchers or some other representative
of the increased cost of living and this
time was not an exception on the
doorstep stood an alert youth whose
long rangy neck was not even partially

     

concealed by the gleaming celluloid col-
lar at its base and whose blue serge
suit gave back the spring sunshine like
a mirror

  when mrs armbruster opened the
door he stepped confidently forward
and thrust a large and able foot against
it plunging into conversation at the
same moment with what was intended
for a genial smile

  good morning madam he said
if i may have just a moment of your
valuable time i would like to show you
what we are doing in the line of artistic
enlargements from cabinet photographs
dont confuse what we have to offer
with the ordinary work of that kind
he continued hastily as mrs armbrus-
ter began an impatient shaking of her
head it will take but a moments
glance by a person of culture like you to
recognize the great advance that has
been made in this line

  dont bother yourself she inter-
rupted as he began tugging at the fas-
tenings of a portfolio under his arm
i dont want any pictures enlarged
i dont care to see em i havent got
the time

  she essayed to close the door but the


smiths magazine

impassive foot still rested firmly against
it she scarcely felt equal to walking
in and leaving the door open with the
confident young man in the aperture
and she hesitated in annoyed indecision

  just let me show you a sample of
our work he went on fumbling
among the life-size crayon pictures in
the carrier and im quite sure you
will agree with me that its far ahead

of anything-

  its no use showing me anything
she acidly interposed youre only
wasting time i havent any photo-
graphs to enlarge and i havent any
money to waste  foolishness so you

might as well not bother-

  she stopped short staring at the
crayon portrait that the persistent
young man in the celluloid collar had
finally extricated from the package and
held before her enticingly it was a
picture of a dashing gallant with bushy
hair roached up at a fascinating angle
and mustaches tightly curled at the
ends a horseshoe stickpin in the scarf
bespoke the sportsman and an elks
button in the coat lapel proclaimed the
original of the picture to be one of the
boys

  after the first look of incredulous
surprise mrs armbrusters thin lips
settled into a straight line and she
folded her work-worn arms with deci-
sion

  where did you get that picture
she demanded with a nod toward the
crayon adonis

  the eager salesman who had read in
her first expression amazement over the
marvelous art offered by the peerless
copying company put his knee against
the half-open door and tried to step
inside he was determined that  one
who had made that first incautious step
on the road toward becoming a cus-
tomer should escape

  oh this is just a sample of the regu-
lar work we turn out he said i
carry several pictures of both ladies
and gents so you can select the style
you want now this class of picture

always---

  i dont care anything about your
styles and your classes mrs armbrus-

ter persisted i want to know where
you got that picture

  he began to have a dim suspicion
that the art treasure was stolen from
her private collection

  why the manager gave it to me
when he was making up this portfolio
he explained

  mrs armbruster eyed him narrowly
as if she had her doubts of that state-
ment

  oh he did did he  she snapped
and who is the manager

  by this time the young man in the
shiny serge suit was struggling in
strange waters and out of his depth
he had become accustomed to rebuffs
of every conceivable degree and insult
rolled off him like the pattering of hail-
stones but this inquiry was along
such unaccustomed lines that  portion
of the speech he had painstakingly
learned in the offices of the peerless
copying company seemed to fit it and
he had recourse to the simple truth

  i dont know what youre getting at
lady he floundered and all i can tell
you is this here picture is one that was
made in our studios and probably left
on the companys hands for some rea-
son or another maybe it wasnt paid
for thats where most of these sam-
ples come from to tell you the truth
we dont have em made up just to
show to customers-theyre regular en-
largements the manager is mr mc-
glue and he put this enlargement into
this portfolio as much as two months
ago when i was starting out if theres
anything wrong i can give you my word

that i aint-

  i didnt say there was anything
wrong the landlady reminded him
only i happen to be sort o interested
in that picture if youll be good enough
to tell me where i can find this mr mc-
glue ill go downtown and see him
the agent hesitated with the firms
card half drawn from his pocket and
looked at her grim face doubtfully

  if you had in mind ordering an en-
largement in this style he said hold-
ing out the picture with the fascinating
curled mustaches again i could take
your order now
trailing henry



  i havent anything of the sort in
mind mrs armbruster assured him
still studying the pictured features with
attention theres nothing i need less
than crayon enlargements but if you
dont mind leaving that picture with
me id like to take it down to mr mc-
glues office when i go

  i dont think i could do that he
said doubtfully especially as you aint
a customer if you ordered an en-
largement-

  ill be responsible for it she said
stiffly this is my rooming house and
if the picture gets
lost or damaged i
can pay for it all
right you just leave
it with me and ill
explain to the man-
ager when i see him

you can get it again
from him to-morrow

you see she added

its that picture i
want to talk about
and i ought to have it
to show him so hell
understand

  she held out her
hand for it confident-
ly and the young
man regretfully re-
leased his hold on it
and handed her the
card bearing the ad
dress of the peerless
copying company

  well if its any
favor to you lady
he said you can take
it for a couple of
days ill be around
this way again in a
week or so and i
hope youll keep me
in mind if you hear
of any of your
friends wanting any
enlargements y o u
can sec the grade of

work we do-

  he had incautious-
ly removed his foot
from the door and

mrs armbruster saw her opportunity
to retire in triumph

  thank you she said ill keep
you in mind ill leave the picture with
your manager good morning aijd
she deftly closed the door on his flow
of eloquence

  mr hugh mcglue portly puffy
red-faced and argumentative sat be-
hind his desk in the office of the peer-
less copying company that afternoon
ready for trouble he was not par-
ticular whether it came by way of a

dont bother yourself she interrupted  dont care to see em
havent got the time


smiths magazine

slothful and negligent solicitor who
preferred to starve rather than hustle
for business or through an irate cus-
tomer who had the nerve to find flaws
in the art standards of the peerless
company in either instance mr mc-
glue was there to meet it combat it
and emerge triumphant

  to him entered a meek and brow-
beaten young man from the outer office
announcing that mrs armbruster was
in waiting for an audience and that
she carried a package that looked sus-
piciously like one of their peerless
crayon enlargements

  humph another kicker mr
mcglue commented theyre coinin
in bunches well send her in i can
handle em as fast as they come

  he glanced up and nodded curtly
making no attempt to rise when his
caller sidled in through the narrow
opening that the depressed clerk made
for her in the doorway

  good afternoon he said with an
impressive lack of geniality what
can i do for you 

  mrs armbruster seated herself on
the edge of a chair beside his desk and
with nervous fingers slipped string and
wrappings from the borrowed portrait
and held it out to the manager

  i wanted to ask you about this pic-
ture she faltered

  mr mcglue looked it over with a
critical consideration

  well whats the matter with it he
demanded the lights and shades on
the face are good and i think the artist
got a whole lot of expression into it
around the eyes that wasnt much of
a photograph to work from in the first
place it looks to me like there was a
whole lot better likeness in this enlarge-
ment than there was in the cabinet
oh im not complaining about the
picture mrs armbruster interposed
when she got a chance its a perfect
likeness so far as that goes what i
want to know is whether you can tell
me where this gentleman is now

  the manager rotated his cigar rapid-
ly as he stared at her and tried to fath-
om the reasons underlying this remark-
able statement

  wsay you havent got this place
mixed up with police headquarters
have you he said then whats the
idea of coinin in here askin about this
party this isnt any detective agency
-were in the picture-enlargin busi-
ness

  i understand that his caller said
with some asperity-it did not require
much to induce mrs armbruster to
strike back but seeing that you peo-
ple made the picture  thought maybe
you could give me his address its my
husband she added bringing the cor-
ners of her thin mouth down into the
expression of relentless severity with
which she was wont to meet explana-
tions concerning overdue room rent

  the manager continued to regard her
and the dashing gent of the horseshoe
pin and curled mustaches with a puz-
zled frown

  i dont get you yet lady he said
if this party is your husband you
ought to know more about where he is
than we do just because we copied a

picture for you-

  but you didnt copy it for me she
interrupted thats why im coming
to you i havent seen him for four
years and he didnt have any enlarge-
ment like this made at that time so he
must have ordered it since and i sup-
posed youd have the address on your
book

  mr mcglue laid down his cigar and
nodded his head wisely

  oh i see he said he just got
up and quit one day and never showed
again is that it 

  and left me with two dollars and
eighteen cents mrs armbruster added
bitterly you see i hadnt only
known him about three months when
we got married but i never dreamed
hed do any trick like that he was an
awful handsome man she concluded
looking at the portrait in her lap with a
little sigh

  he wasnt a bad-lookin feller the
manager admitted but  never can
go on looks

  you wouldnt believe what that man
did mr mcglue she continued fixing
her accusing glance on the armbruster
trailing hendry



features that smiled up at her so con-
fidently he took four hundred dol-
lars of m money that id saved-and
its no easy thing for a woman to save
any money keeping roomers counting
them that dont pay up and the cost of
help and all and he was going to buy
out a cigar store with it and what did
he do but run away and leave me to
face the world with that two dollars
and eighteen cents i happened to have
left after settling the grocery bill

  that was four years ago mr mc-
glue and not a sign of him have i seen
or heard of since until your agent come
around to my place this morning so-
liciting for pictures to be copied and
showed me this one for a sample it
looks like there was a providence in it
so i asked your young man to lend me
the picture to show you and see if you
could tell me off your book where i can
find him

  she concluded with the ribbons and
flowers on her hat all of a-tremble and
mr mcglue looked at her curiously

  what are you goin to do if you
find him he asked

  do mrs armbruster repeated

drawing her lips a shade tighter even
than they had been im going to drag
him to jail thats what im going to
do i havent toiled and starved and
searched and hunted all these years for
nothing if i find henry armbruster
even if lies on his dying bed im going
to have the law on him and see him be-
hind prison bars if its the last breath i
draw

 whew whistled the manager
youre goin the limit aint you
well its none of my funeral and i
guess he deserves all thats coinin to
him at that i dont want to mix up in
your troubles mrs armbuster-

  armbruster she corrected stiffly

  thats what i meant he went on
tm willin to give you the last address
we have for this party providin the
company isnt dragged into it any ways
he must owe us for this picture or it
would have been delivered i dont
mind sort of gettin square for that

  from the books in the outer office
the browbeaten clerk produced the ad-
dress of henry armbruster and the
additional information that mr arm-
bruster had been sued by the peerless


smiths magazine

copying company for twelve dollars
the price of the portrait with an ornate
gilt frame that judgment had been re-
turned against him and that  prop-
erty upon which a levy could be made
had been found by the sheriff with
which enlightening data mrs armbrus-
ter departed leaving the crayon on the
managers desk

 lemme know how you come out
will you  he asked as he held the door
open for her im sort of curious
about that cuss and besides you know
weve got a judgment against him

  ill telephone you she assured him
and i cant thank you enough for get
ting the address tve been thinking
about it day and night for four years
two days later mr mcglues tele-
phone jingled and a piping feminine
voice inquired for him

  yes this is mcglue he snorted
who is this

  this is mrs armbruster she said
i just happened to remember i told
you id call up and let you know
well how goes it the manager in-
quired almost genially it was a trifle
hard for mr mcglue to drop his pro-
fessional manner on short notice

  that was the right address mrs
armbruster said ive found the
house all right but i havent got hold 
of him yet they tell me hes out on
the road and wont be back until satur-
day morning i didnt believe em at
first and ive been staying around to
see if he went in or out but i guess
now hes out of town

  i suppose youll be right on the job
saturday morning mr mcglue sug
gested

  i certainly will she snapped
and hell get the surprise of his life
imagine the nerve of that man mr
mcglue living in a boarding house
right here in town where i might run
into him almost any minute i never
let on to the woman that keeps the place
who i was-i told her i was from his
old town and that i promised his folks
to look him up wasnt that the best
thing to say

  that was all right the manager

commended warmly you couldnt do
better if you was canvassin for en-
largements how did she take it

  i dont think she suspected a thing
the deserted wife said earnestly and
i was scared all the time i was talking
to her for fear she might know some-
thing and write him a letter warning
him to keep away or something like
that but ill get him saturday ill
come down on him like a thousand of
brick as soon as he gets to town

  ive got a man rooming at my house
thats taking one of these mail-order
courses in the law and i was asking
him last night what my rights were-i
had to tell somebody and he seemed
the most likely that wouldnt charge me
-and he told me td better take out a
warrant for him charging desertion
and have him locked up right away and
then sent to the penitentiary for ten or
fifteen years but he says i cant do
anything about the money because a
husband is allowed to steal from his
own wife under the law doesnt that
seem queer to you mr mcglue

  it is pretty tough he admitted
but i guess thats the law all right
well i hope you land him saturday
stick to it mrs armbruster youve
got all the best of it now after waitin
four years good-by and he hung up
in the midst of her farewells

  the manager was rather expecting a
message from mrs armbruster satur-
day afternoon-he felt sure she would
hasten to share her triumph with him
and he was not surprised when her
voice came over the wire

  this is mrs armbruster mr mc-
glue i wish youd have that picture i
left there fixed up in a nice gilt frame
and send it up to me she said cheer-
ily the same kind of a frame you
put on it the-the other time you
know

  i sure will the manager said
want it for a kind of a souvenir eh
how did you come out with friend hus-
band 

  oh i was going to tell you about
that she cooed henry came home
with me to-day twelve dollars was
the price wasnt it

ter smoothed the coverlet with work-
hardened caressing hands and stole
from the room

  out under the grape arbor where
the sunshine dripped greenly gold upon

strength still beside whom his parched
and withered wife seemed as his
mother but the smiling old face he
lifted to his granddaughter was as
sweet and void of all speculation as
a babys silvia knowing perfectly his
helplessness to aid yet cast herself upon
him of old habit

  grandsire she wants to be moved
right now

  sartain she does wealthy has al-
ways got to have things happen right
now he chuckled she aint a-goin
to miss out any o her own proper
time lcs see twas when you was a
baby warnt it she histed me off on
a stretcher his serene face clouded
as he groped in memories

   twas mother sir she supplied
gently

  yes yes course twas polly
where was  wealthy she whipped
me right out o bed-me all tied up
from the kick o a colt so as i couldnt
stir han nor foot-an jounced me off
to her own abode lie laughed richly
now in a great rumbling bass

  but grandsire shes terrible sick
her heart- she stopped in the fu-
tility of it

  oh shell make it through wealthy
will still in his mirth once she
puts her hand to the plow aint no
turnin back for her he set to work
again valiantly as if spurred by this
rehearsal of his wifes prowess

  silvia flung out her hands impatient-
ly and warned of the folly of speech
ran down into the garden pleasant with
the first tender young sprouts of early
vegetables beyond the garden
stretched away the wide brown spaces
of newly plowed land and in the clean
furrows the scriptural figure of the
sower going forth to sow outlined it-
self against the pale spring sky swing-
ing in a steady rhythm she leaned
against the stone wall and signaled him
urgently

  the farmer finished his row before
he strode over to her saying in a mild
slow voice

  you want somethin silvy

  she will move to-day she flung at
him acutely

 a smile all humorous sweetness
played over the mans tanned face boy-
ishly thin still in the hollows of cheek
and temple silvias excitements always
moved his easy unstressful nature
whimsically

  so shes set on movin eh he re-
peated after her

  the girl gave her characteristic flare
of the hands dont you sense any-
thin ross she scolded in a shrew-
ishness given to him only shes dyin
doctor says she cant hold out moren a
day or two now an this awful movin
will kill her right now

  he leaned on the fence beside her
is it any great matter whether she
goes to-day or to-morrow  he pon-
dered more to himself than to her

  you aint got proper feelins yet
she knew that he had always cherished
his grandmother in a tender affection

  its just that i deem twould be
kinder to let her go to-day contented
in her own home than to keep her down
here a few hours longer frettin an
pinin for it

  her home silvia sniffed in a high
scorn you tell me what you call this
house where shes lived over thirty
year if it aint her home

  ross smiled in a wise understanding
 taint ever been just exactly home
to her sil an you know it the other
house was built for her specially by her
father in a grand style thats the home
o her heart

  fiddle-dee-dee intensely youre
just a chip o that block yourself

  his slow brooding gaze traveled
across the acres of good red earth fur-
rowed by his own plow to the ring of
wood beyond trimmed by his own ax
then to the plot of ground in the wind-
sheltered hollow where touched by the
sunlight the gravestones of his fore-
fathers shone white as far as eye
could see the land was his won for
him from the wild beast and the sav-
age by those battling enduring fore-
fathers

  his keen young face softened to a
still dreaminess his eyes darkened with
a sense of the mystery of life his lips
quivered at a taste of its sadness the
her dwelling place



love of the soil watered by the blood
of his race enriched by their bones
deep as the saxons poetic as the celts
smote his heartstrings till they vibrated
achingly he forgot the girl at his side
and her mockery forgot place and time

  for my part the girl cut across his
mood crisply i give thanks i was
born to the city in a house that was
tore down the next year an have
jaunted round through every corner o
the union since

  he stared at her still in his daze
an the sights o houses ive camped
in mother used to say the hymn that
suited her condition was 

     an nightly pitch my rovin tent
     a days march nearer home

  im all trained to wed a methodist
preacher she laughed out in sly mal-
ice at some thrust of her own

  you aint goin to be given the op-
portunity he retorted upon her his
mystic mood cast off like a garment
the reverend john wesley appleton
is sparkin cindy barrett zealousern a
revival meetin

  she dont count old nough to be
his mother undaunted  then her cares
folding round her again  but ross
what i goin to do bout granny
just you wrap her up good an
warm an have her bed to the other
house ready an ill carry her there in
my arms like she was a baby she
wont take any kind o harm

  you wouldnt try to coax her to stay
here a spell her eyes anxiously on
him

  you couldnt an poor ol soul
let her have one more day in her own
home

  my country  in pale exasperation 
then in her unconscious manner of
leaning on his fidelity youll be long
in bout a couple o hours wont you
shell be waked up then an all in a
tew to be off

  rosswaine lamay watched the girls
quick pace through the garden till her
slim figure was lost in the shadows of
the arbor pretty little creature he
told himself fondly as he went back to
his furrows silvia tates thoughts

were not on rosswaine at all he was
there kind and sure always her mind
was fretted with the problem of her
patient and with the deeper one of hu-
man natures perversity

  why didnt grandsire act up good
an solid seventy year ago an make
granny live to one house whether or
no  she thought with the conviction
of youth that if only some one will do
something presto the perverse heart
will be at once changed she studied
as if for the first time the old old
house bowed scarred and blackened
with the years and her resentment
flowed away whod blame granny
though cribbed up here

  old abijah lamay still sat in the
dappled light the uncompleted harness
swinging in his fingers silvia laid a
hand on his shoulder upon impulse

  grandsire did you an granny con-
tend considble bout which house youd
live in fore you settled down to this
seesaw performance 

  the happenings of last week were
blurred in the old brain the memories
of half a century still bit sharp he an-
swered with a rich relish in this twice-
told tale

  pretty nigh busted up our partner-
ship polly he thought her her
mother dead years ago wealthy
shes sot-all the holtons be an
abijah well hes a lamay an theyve
got a kind o name round these parts
for holdin onto their point fie
laughed pridefully in the strength of
his breed she had a good new house
wife did just heired from her father
bout the handsomest dwellin in the
county twas deemed then had a
newfangled buttry water pumped
right into the kitchen a fine new cook
stove shiny as fury an i dont know
what all this little old place didnt
show up any too peart longside

  again silvia considered her grand-
fathers house dispassionately in its
best days it had been  more than a
poorly built cottage lean-to the win-
dows ill-matched crookedly set the
doors sagging away from their walls
and now in its old age it was forlorn
and sodden of the interior only a

  whose idea was it grandsire this
ring-round-a-rosy play o yours an
grannys 

  your mothers child she always
had the headpiece for the two o us
where is mother why i aint seen
her this whole mornin his face
trembled piteously like a childs his
blue eyes filled with anxiety

  shes kind o nappin she soothed
him her hand on his youll see her
pretty quick you say granny was set
an determined to live in her gran new
house an you was set ah determined
to live here in your ol one she
turned him skillfully back into his
story

  wealthy she blazed an banged -
thats the way temper takes the holtons
-an i went round dumbs a ox for
thats my fashion o anger an both on
us-we let on after twas all over-was
scared nigh dead for fear we couldnt
be wedded wealthy even went so far
as to make her talk bout goin to york
state to dwell with an aunt when i
heard that i bout caved in but not
quite

  i think you were just two-sillies
vehemently

 was so but you see darter i
hadnt ever slep a night under no other
roof but this an i couldnt bring my-
self to give it up an wealthy she was
proudern any peacock to be mistress o
such a noble mansion well one day
she come to me-twas sabbath after-
noon right in the early fall o the year
an weather thatd make an ol horse
cavort same as a colt down by that
gate she stood for my folks was all
dead same as hers an she could talk
without fear o bein spied on she had
on her meetin frock still-i mind me
of it like it was yesterday for all its
nigh to seventy year ago-a little pink
frock twas an she wore a big white
rose in her bosom his bright blue
childs eyes rested on the old fence as
if he saw again the small and fiery
sweetheart of those days

 granny must have been pretty in
the face for all shes so dark mused
the fair-haired granddaughter

  a beauty she was instantly an

her eyes were like stars she says to
me snap-bang like a soldier abijah
lamay since i cant give in an you
wont ive come to offer a kind o mid-
dle course the lord himself only
knows why any girl should prize such
a stubborn fellow as you i tell you
silvy when she flung that word right
into my face my heart bumped down
into my boots i couldnt a spoke a
word if my life had hung on it

   but i do prize you says she fierce
as if shed said hate well live man
an wife one month here in this ol
ramshackle house then well go next
month up to my good dwelling then
next month back well swing an so on
long as the lord spares us 

  did you say yes grandsire

  didnt say nothin i leaned over
close an i saw her eyes was all misted
up with tears an i made one leap over
that fence an i had her so tight in
my arms that rose was flattern paper
an there aint been a happier couple in
pettipaug township he ended trium-
phantly

  silvia laughed softly its a reglar
lamay story grandsire but i like it
she stroked his white hair fine as silk
the fire of his tale had died out he
looked tired and dull and his eyes
closed sleepily his granddaughter left
him dozing

  as she stepped about the dark
crooked little kitchen on a hundred ca-
pable errands she mused upon the an-
cient romance and the husband and wife
who in summers heat and winters
frost month in month out for nearly
seventy years had moved back and
forth from the tall house on the hill
to the sunken one in the hollow she
could see how determination of will and
conscious action of mind had hardened
into unconscious habit and it again into
the very stuff of life itself so that by
and by they could no more think of
themselves without the monthly pil-
grimage than without their own hands
and feet

  in the girl a sudden wave of bitter-
ness surged hotly what heritage of
loyalty to old allegiances had she
cooped up this morning to work in this


smiths magazine

little hot kitchen with tools old and
clumsy or if freed only that she
might fly to get the other house in or-
der she was no lamay nor hol-
ton a kinless landless man in the
words of the saxon chronicle she had
no art nor part in the deep things of
their blood for although abijah and
wealthy lamay had reared her with
care and love which she now paid back
in double she was not their grand-
child

  their youngest daughter polly had
fallen in love with ambrose tate a
handsome gentle neer-do-well who
had wandered into pettipaug from no
one knew where and after a years
unsuccessful farming had wandered
away again into vague regions classi-
fied as out west not alone this time
did he go he took pretty polly with
him-secretly for her parents had for-
bidden the marriage

  fie had not had the plea of young
passion to cover his theft for he had
been ten years older than his little bride
and she had been his second wife his
first having left him a baby daughter
for the next ten years ambrose polly
and the little girl had called the map
of north america their home

  the child had delighted in such an
entertaining existence and had thrived
in their vagrant ways she had idolized
her stepmother and forlorn homesick
polly childless herself disappointed in
her husband had found all the com
fort of her sad heart in loving the child
back when silvia had been twelve
her father had faded out of life as
futilely and uncomplainingly as he had
wandered through it fler mother
stricken herself with a fatal illness
had struggled home to the old people
to confide the child to their kindness

  she had accepted without question
this new station on the march and
had set herself cheerily to discover its
special good points the greatest of
these had been a lively boy a couple of
years older than herself ready to be
playfellow to a girl and full to the
brim of fascinating lore of stream and
wood and four-footed creatures they
had become fast friends and now at

the end of a dozen years were so truly
kin as to be like brother and sister

  silvia could not tell why to-day of
all the many lived among these kindly
cherishing people she should feel alone
outside their lives they had seemed
entirely her own family always now
she realized suddenly that their herit-
ages were not hers and that she lacked
any born in her own blood fler fathers
people she knew vaguely as poor and
unconsidered her mothers she knew
not at all she had no past she stood
out bleak and unprotected against an
unshaded nozv

  she turned impatiently and a dish
clashed at her elbow the old woman
in the next room stirred in her sleep
and noting that as a sign that the ef-
fect of the medicine was wearing off
she hurried away to the other house to
let the sweet spring warm it

  wealthy lamays own house was
indeed a brave structure in spite of
seventy years existence it still wore
an air of bright modernity silvia
matching its high ceilings wide win-
dows and clear spaces with the crowd-
ed dark tuck-holes of her grandfathers
house swung over in a swift approval
to her other grandparent

  granny ought to have just stood
out she cried vehemently to ross
who was building her a fire in the fine
new cook stove wonderful yet after
the hearth and crane in the hollow
 twasnt any kind o conduct in
grandsire to ask a woman to cook up a
meal o food in such a poor unhandy
fashion o place as his let lone raise a
family o children

  ross laughed in the amusement her
intensity always produced

  you ever tried a session o standin
out again him he gibed mildly

  the girl reminded of disastrous ven-
tures of childhood reddened but an
swered stoutly

  she was his sweetheart she could
a compelled terms

  didnt she

  terms in contempt all the men
that ever captured quebec or built it
for the matter o that wouldnt make
me spend one single night in that 
hr dwelling place



hole in the ground if i had me an ele-
gant abidin place like this

  ross still smiling shifted the theme
adroitly leaving according to his cus-
tom the last word with her

  open the doors now sil while i
hist the windows well have the good
fresh air in an the damp dried out
quickern figgerin

  ill run get granny ready i hope
to mercy she wont be struck with one
o her spells right in the middle o the
road

  it was characteristic of both the man
and the girl that neither made any han-
dle of the personal trouble of this
strange housekeeping of their grand
parents yet rosswaine must shift stock
and fodder up into the other barn while
for silvia an endless patter of her
light feet to and fro was necessary to
complete a comfortable change it was
near midnight when the old people were
safely asleep in bed the last of the
gear disposed in its place and the
bread set for morning

  silvia stood a moment in the open
kitchen door leaning against the lintel
her eyes afar across the night scene
the valley of the connecticut lay flood
ed in moonlight and beyond the swim-
ming reaches of the river the hills
stretched away into mysterious dark-
ness the hour was one of perfect
quiet the myriad voices of the sum-
mer night not yet strong to break its
stillness the fine wet pipings of the
young frogs in the brook only serving
to heighten it

  silvia essentially a creature of day-
light and the clear values of high noon
was yet swayed by the magic and the
mystery of the spring night alive in its
hushed spirit with the splendid secrets
of the unborn summer

  aint it sightly she murmured to
the dim figure on the step

  ross could not answer his poets
soul was aching with the sense of the
dim beauty at the heart of things
wonderful sightly she said
again then because her wholesome
warm nature never strayed far from
kindly human needs ross youll get
the ague settin out in such a green

night o spring its gettin on for all
hours you go to bed

  the watcher of the moon sighed in a
shivering ecstasy ive shut up every-
thin snug he forced himself to a
commonplaceness to meet hers go
long to bed yourself youre all beat
out

  you be up real kind o early in the
mornin 

  he had risen and stood close beside
her ive made all my calculations to
stay here

  oh ross you can make yourself
in an extremity of amaze

  ross father the only son of abijah
and wealthy had never left the pater-
nal house after his marriage not even
on the singular monthly trekking of his
father and mother at his death in his
sons boyhood his widow had elected
to stay steadily at the place in the hol-
low when she too died a few years
later ross had clung to the only home
he knew taking his meals up at the
new house as it was still called but
sleeping in the bedroom in which he
had been born

  his grandparents in spite of their
great age had been so hale that his
aid had not been necessary at night
now wealthy desperately ill and abi-
jah lost of wits were a great care for
the girl who had trembled at the
thought of the long night alone with
them but had not ventured to suggest
to ross such a vast emprise as sleep-
ing for the first time in his whole life
under any rooftree other than the
moss-grown one built by the famed con-
queror of the french

  you aint talkin serious are you
she ventured again as he stood by her
still as the night and as she thought
a little pale in the moon mist

  yes i am too with a vehemence
oddly different from his usual sweet
placidity it comes kind o hard-i
aint sayin that it dont-but id be a
poor sort o a tool if i left a little small
creature such as you be to rastle the
night out alone

  suddenly he caught her shoulders
gripping her hard with his strong farm-
ers hands his eyes darkly hot his tall

limber figure swaying a flame leaping
from him to her silvia pleasantly mat
ter of fact ever centered on the calm
noonday was swept by a wind from the
wood beyond the world was blinded by
a flash of white magic she stood still
and dumb

  in a moment it had passed ross had
loosed her and was fastening the shut
ters with a clatter she shook herself
clear of her trance with a short good
night hurrying away to her bed by
her grandmothers side

  in the face of silvias worries old
wealthy took no harm from her change
of bed and in spite of the doctors
impossible appeared to be growing
well it was the hale old grandfather
who one afternoon when all the sky
was crocus-colored unmoored his
bark of mortality and voyaged forth
upon that river that flows around the
world forever

  silvia had settled him comfortably
in a rocker-warm against the keen
edge of spring in his old army coat a
broken basket and withes to mend it on
his lap-on the veranda that looked out
over the narrow valley of green laced
in and out with the silver ribbon of the
river and the handful of white houses
that gleamed in the distant village lie
had gone to work contented as a child
his innocent old eyes bright upon the
task silvia with a show of love not
part of her pettipaug training but one
of the graces heired from her luckless
father leaned her shining hair against
the pale beauty of his head and kissed
him

  dear grandsire she murmured in
a tender wonder as to what it must
seem to be old and feeble and done
with the world

  the old man smiled in placid affec-
tion youre a proper nice child
silvy an good to your ol father
then in a flash of memory you
couldnt be better to me if i was your
own blood kin-no an i couldnt prize
you more

  an hour later she found him asleep
his head resting against the back of his
chair his hands folded above the mend-
ed basket

  the wife of his youth-that long
long-ago youth-heard of his death in
the strange calm of the very aged

  so bijahs gone first she mur-
mured her vivid eyes upon silvia who
in the sorrow of the young for all
death was weeping  guess  shant
have to put up with many weeks now
fore i see him again it was her sur-
render in the tight she had waged
against even the name of death

  later they heard her whispering to
herself abijah lamay was the ablest
young man in pettipaug township an
the most upright an the handsomest
in the face seventy year come no-
vember  an its clearer to me than
what happened yesterday

  she lay silent a long time then
roused to say sharply to ross who sat
beside her in silvias absence

  whos in the kitchen with silvy
its artemesia torrance shes
come to help out a spell

  um um ambiguously aint it
strange rossie out o em all-children
an granchildren-theres only you lef
to do for me 

  you forget silvy granny

  the old face puckered into a hun-
dred fine wrinkles like the cobweb
cracks of flawed glass  silvys a good
girl tender o me as an own darter
too but she aint no blood kin-dont
ye ever forget that son she laid her
withered hand on his where it rested
on the bed beside her

  ross waited till his resentment for
silvia was quieted shes just the
same as kin to me with force

  you deem that torrance girls a
likely capble creature in a sudden
non sequitur

  ross remembered her skill in reliev-
ing silvia from many burdens shes
a reglar driver an real kind too
then the girl as a distinct personality
came before him shes handsome as
any picture too

  any abler woman than our silvy or
sweeter to look on  some secret anx-
iety edged her voice

  why no t cant say as she is
ponderingly but silvys a little thin
fashion o person an artemesias a
her dwelling place



great splendid wom-
an-looks like she
was made to carry
big weights o things
o the world an the
spirit too

 i guess ive
viewed her considble
few times with ex-
treme dryness you
fetch judge ackerley
up here right away

  cant you wait till
morn in grandsires
only just gone he
remonstrated to this
caprice

  you do as i bid
ye doctor said i
warnt to be crossed

she pushed his hand
from her her eyes
blazed her voice
shrilled imperiously

 obedient ross
started from the
room a murmur fol-
lowing from the bed 

  artemesia a ter
r  b  e soft-soundin
name but if theres
any soft spot in one
o the torrance tribe
they are changed

since- the rest

was lost

  after abijah lamays death life at
the farm went on as before ross
plowed and planted silvia tended the
house and nursed her grandmother
drifting slowly toward the end of all
living one change there was of deep
import-artemesia torrance stayed on
to help silvia ross said to please
ross silvia thought in a strange stir
of bitterness

  artemesia of the flowery name did
indeed resemble a blossom a high-col-
ored hollyhock or a bouncing peony
she was a tall coltish girl with a beau-
tiful mane of bronze hair and cheeks
as round and as red as apples she
and her mother who often came to see
her were noted trainers in the town-

ship  mirth and laughter bubbled over
from them constantly silvia whose
early wanderings had bred in her a
staid responsibility for herself and
others and who took life with a pleas-
ant seriousness watched the two in
baffled puzzlement but ross openly
valued any one so joyous

  so a month passed and all the ten-
der misty green of early spring had
flowered into the pink and white of
the beginning of summer one per-
fumed morning when the whole valley
was shrouded in a silver fog old
wealthy woke as if summoned

  silvy 

  yes dear her faithful hand-
maiden was by her side

  what day o the weeks this

  saturday


smiths magazine

  the old lips smiled grimly

            saturdays flittin

           makes a short sittin

  darter your grandsires months
come round again

  silvia her pretty curly hair loose
over her shoulders her scant little cot-
ton nightgown hanging straight to her
feet like a childs tier argued piteously
granny dear youre so snug here
an the rooms so sightly

  the sick womans eyes traveled about
the room high and spacious then
sought the far-off hills rising gold-
rimmed of the sun above the fog

  ive always taken a sight o com-
fort lyin in this bed an watchin the
light creep up clearer an clearer over
lyme hills till the river was all ashine
with it an  knew twas time to rise
there aint another such a prospect in
all pettipaug she sigiied deeply
there aint nothin to see from my
chamber in the other house cept the
end o the corncrib-but its time to
go

  silvia stroked the tiny face under the
frilled cap grandsire aint there
dear youve no call to move any more
old wealthy darted a ferret glance
at her my call as you put it is the
word that went forth from me seventy
year ago i vowed then id move evry
month so long as t lived an im a-goin
to keep that covenant in spite o evry
one she stretched her hand toward
her granddaughter as if putting a curse
upon her if she thwarted her righteous
purpose

  under such compulsion silvia hur-
ried into her clothes to start the jour
ney the day begun in mists darkened
to twilight in a sad little rain the
leaky chimney of the cottage dripped
monotonously into a bucket gusts of
dampness blew in through the loose-
hung windows the sweet rank scent of
wet plowed fields

  in the small heavily raftered bed-
room silvia sat bathing the sick wom-
ans face or moistening her lips with
a cordial a thin flame burned in the
lamp its flickerings like the wavering
of life in the frail body ross stood

at the foot of the bed leaning against
its heavy rail his eyes sorrowful at the
passing of the last of his race

  i said twas wrong to move her
murmured silvia for the tenth time
tears running thick over her cheeks

  the flaccid lids opened wide over
eyes that still held a spark of vital fire

  hadnt nothin to do with it my
time has come wheres ross

  here granny he crowded in be-
side silvia so close in the narrow space
that his shoulder pressed hers

  silvia youve been a dear good
child fhe words were forming them-
selves slowly there aint no tellin
what youve been to me this dozen
years the thread of sound dwindled
into silence

  silvia dropped to her knees her face
buried in the covers

  the voice came again startlingly
strong

  but she aint  manner o kin you
mind that rossie not a drop o your
blood runs in her veins

  the girl flung up her head in an
agony of remonstrance

  the deaths ye died
  i have watched beside

  and the lives ye lived were mine

might have been her cry must she
then be shut out-an alien

  ross put his arm around her shoul-
ders comfortingly

  in the fluttering light a bluish shade
stole up over the pinched features and
the small puckered face shrank deeper
into the pillows yet the dark eyes
glowed still from the unconquerable
soul

  take her hand ross

  with cold fingers closing over the
girls as chill as his the young man
obeyed

  tell her she aint no kin at all the
voice was thickening now yet each
word reached them ask her will she
wed you to be your wife

  like one under a spell ross mut-
tered the words after her his hand
gripping silvias in a bruising hold

  silvy you tell him yes youll wed
him
hep dwelling place



  the girl hung upon her answer
amazed frightened

  ancient fires flared in the dying
woman imperious to the end you
aint got all week to answer she
threatened im a-goin mighty fast
hes set by you like a lover for years
only he hadnt waked up to it an you
prize him too moren your own eyes
tell him t will 

  tranced now in her turn the girl
answered in a clear high voice

  ross i will

  a faint smile sweet as if born of
heavenly joy touched the dying face
thats good she whispered kiss
me ill hold out till next tide now but
im so tired i cant talk no more
crying  together like children they
kissed her and holding each others
hands tight for comfort took again
their watch by the bed old wealthy
lay all night breathing quietly but she
never spoke again and when the pale
light of the storm-washed dawn flowed
into the room she too drifted out with
the tide past the village past the head-
land into deep eternity

  the small low-studded keepin
room of the cottage overflowed with
relatives and friends of abijah and
wealthy lamay met after the latters
funeral to hear the reading of both
their wills mild surmises concerning
how much abijah was worth were
whispered among the waiting folk
mostly old men and women for al-
though he like his fathers dwelt in a
poor and meanly furnished abode he
was known to be one of the most pros
perous farmers of the valley but the
pith of the interest was in how that
wealth was to be apportioned between
the two heirs his own grandson and
his adopted granddaughter silvia
tates been a true daughter to them old
bodies shrilled old ann blisset a
cousin in a far-reaching whisper

  bloods thickern water-thickern
water mumbled back young silas la-
may a grandnephew

  the sentiment of the gathering was
plainly with silas as the whisper crept
around it was all very well to give

    

bed and board-aye love and faith-
to an outsider while you lived but when
it came to leaving this world why
money followed the family

  ross and silvia in their position of
only near relatives sat apart from the
others she very pale and pretty in her
narrow black dress hastily fashioned
from one of her grandmothers he
flushed and agitated he had thought
of little else save silvia since that un-
earthly betrothal and his heart beat
constantly in a hurried race with his
brain silvia on the contrary had
thought of nothing at all through the
day she worked in a numb speed at
the many tasks that followed death in
a long-ago farmhouse at night she
slept drugged by fatigue

  now at last in the still room tense
with the many expectancies working
there her mind opened to the consid-
eration of her own standing penni-
less she had come to this house penni-
less should she go and where then
her wits startled from their torpor
leaped to their strange compact how
did ross really feel toward it plow
did she feel herself her feet and
hands were lumps of ice her whole
body chill to the bone a long sigh
of thankfulness stirred the black fichu
on her bosom when judge ackerley rose
with solemn slowness to begin the
reading

  at first she could not fasten her
thoughts on his voice and the where-
ases and the aforesaids of the legal
phrasing glided by her unnoted then
suddenly as at a great distance she
heard him reading out various small
legacies to relatives and to the church 
and after that in a voice that boomed
like a great bell and all the residue
of my property both real and personal
in the township of pettipaug to my
grandson rosswaine lamay

  a whisper rustled around the room
some of the men turned to smile in
congratulation upon ross always a fa-
vorite then shifted around again in
embarrassed remembrance that they
were met just after his grandmothers
funeral

  the judge cleared his throat for a
smiths magazine

ross youll yet the ague settin out in such a green night o spring

second reading-wealthys will she
also had remembered her kin in
smaller gifts this time for captain
holton her father had left her no
wealth being house poor the house
and ground still called the capn hol-
ton place she bequeathed to her grand -
son rosswaine lamay

  this time the whisper was stronger
had nothing at all been left silvia tate

  the judges voice beat down theirs
a codicil made out by me and wit
nessed according to law was added on
the day of the death of abijah lamay
husband of the testatrix i will and
bequeath my house and farm and all

the contents of said house and all the
belongings of said farm not to my
grandson rosswaine lamay but to my
beloved granddaughter by adoption
silvia tate to her and her heirs for-
ever 

  they were all gone at last after a
bountiful supper and the little old
house was silent and dark a shadow
in the hollow silvia on the hill above
it looked away to the uplands still
vivid in the sunset it was weeks since
she had been so far from home she
might not come again soon for arte-
mesia torrance and her mother were
her cdwelling place



to stay on with her for a spell and
they were close companions not to be
avoided to-night they had driven
home for some necessities

  silvia held her eyes away from her
new domain with resolution she did
not want to see it to-night she seemed
to have heard nothing for hours but
how good her grandmother had been
to leave it to her she could not keep
her thoughts off it however like a
spent wayfarer who will not acknowl-
edge weariness till he finds himself safe
home by the fire she had not dared to
ponder her condition now she dwelt
upon her former poverty in the glow
of her present wealth

  a grand house richly furnished all
hers she needed nothing from any
one in a word-independence her
mind swept around to ross he
wouldnt be forced by pity to ask her
again she could live a rich old maid
all her days if she were so minded a
great sigh of relief lifted her like a
wind

  the old house looks powerful lone-
some the voice was low and mild
but her frayed nerves leaped ross
had come up behind her unnoticed had
heard and misinterpreted her sigh

  theyre at rest rossie the child-
hood name fell unregardingly we
dont ask to bring em back to suffer
do we with the gentle resignation of
her serious docile nature

  that dont help the missin o em
silvy his moodier heart rebelled at
the law of life granny an grandsire
were the last o my kin

  she laid her hand on his where it
rested  the bars of the rail fence in
a touch of healing sympathy

  youre kinless too he went on
but forbore to add youve always
been and for such delicacy the lone-
ly girl blessed him

  tts hard the bare words were
deep with the heart behind them

  ross flung his arm around her in a
desolation that made this one comrade
of youth precious beyond words

  i got you still silvy he cried tem-
pestuously

  yes you got me fidelity moved

her voice she felt all other emotion
shut out of it

  lie leaned his head down against
hers holding her close neither spoke
while night sifted down from the skies
and the old house in the hollow was
blotted out of shadows

  aint it strange how granny knew 
began the young man slowly brooding-
ly silvia held her breath till he should
speak again

  id a swore you were just a dear
little sister to me i dont know as id
ever a found out different yet it aint
so theres another bond than blood
between us silvy dont you feel it
too 

  we hadnt ought to talk-about-
it to-night ought we ross 

  yes we had too its the time we
need each other most when all the
rests swept from us suddenly he
thrust her from him keeping her at
arms length silvia that pledge be-
fore granny dont hold lie spoke
stressfully i give you back your free-
dom

  his tall figure was only a blot of
black in the twilight even his voice
sounded far away the girl clasped
the fence rail with clenched fingers and
waited cold with fear

  you got a house an land o your
own you can live independent o me
now here as if we were just a man
an girl from the village down below
that hadnt ever spoke a word o the
thing before i ask you now out plain
an honest

  the girls words fluttered long on her
lips were strange when they came
ross you grudge me the house an
land the least mite

  house he stammered swept be-
yond that point on the tide of his feel-
ing lord child i wish twere three
houses so youd be grand as a queen
such things dont count give me an
honest answer out o a free heart

  to what her lips trembled with
a smile at this new impetuosity of her
easy-going playmate

  ross caught her hands and pulled
her back to him resistlessly

  it aint like you to torment me sil-


smiths magazine

via in a grieved voice i told you
like a man how twas with me i look
for you to give me a mans answer

  she leaned her tired head against his
shoulder and cried tears more of wear-
iness than of grief

  there dearie there you know
youre all i got in the whole world
he soothed her nowan you know i
prize you dearly an ill be good to you
always just you say one little kind
word to me he bent down to catch
the breath of sound

  i didnt have to have granny tell me
i loved you ross

  too tired to prolong even these sweet
confidences before night had fully
come hand in hand they started down
the hill talking in low voices

  sil ross broke in suddenly lets
be wedded to-morrow 

  we cant the day after the fu-
neral 

  next week then why cant we
i dont want mother torrance bangin
round longern has to be

  thats too soon she countered him

  id like to ask why you can get
you up some kind o fal-lals for your
settin out if all three o you put into
the sewin again he was insistent
as only the slow mild ones of the world
can be once set in desire

 in two months-well maybe six
weeks for ross had caught her and
shaken her strongly in his grasp

  a months my say-so he assured
her as they opened the garden gate

  the next morning while the grass
was still filmed with dew-bright cob-
webs and the suns rays fell aslant
from lyme hills silvia fleet and si-
lent let herself into the other house
she wanted to be all to herself when
she came into her own no thumping
artemesia or prying mother must mar
her still delight

  she stepped into the kitchen famil-
iar from childhood yet wearing the
strange face of an old possession seen
in a new mood with the thoroughness
of an auctioneer preparing for a ven-
due she searched its drawers and cup-

boards  then she passed on into the
clock room and so  through all the
house she opened presses examined
shelves delved into boxes nothing es-
caped her

  and what piles of hand-spun smooth
linen heavy blue-and-white bedspreads
rich glossy silk dresses of her grand-
mothers youth ancient beadwork
delicate muslin embroideries all the
plenty of old wealthys inheritance was
stored here for not a box would she
move into the hollow

  then there were the larger relics-
the cedar chests the eight-day clock
the settees highboys bandy-legged ta-
bles and their fellows silvia seemed
never to have seen them before al-
though winding the hall clock had been
her weekly task since childhood and
her arms had ached from polishing the
mahogany tables

  at noon she seated herself in a pool
of sunshine on the kitchen floor and
counted over her horde there wasnt
another bride in pettipaug-not even
judge ackerleys daughter who was
tokened to the poston minister-who
had such a settin out

  her fancy winged its way to won-
derful tea parties in which all the young
women of pettipaug strangely stiff in
their mcetin gowns should sit around
the wall in her noble foreroom while
she herself resplendent in a certain
ashes-of-roses silk edged with thread
lace once worn by her great-grand-
motlier should exchange polite conver-
sation-quite different from the chat
of ordinary days-with each guest in
turn

  then when the sun began to cast
long shadows over the lawn-few in-
deed were the pettipaug houses that
could boast a lawn-she would wave
all her guests out into the dining room
where upon the carved mahogany ta-
ble should sit the silver coffee urn and
the eggshell china painted with the
sprigs of pink roses

  silvia clasped her hard little hands
in an ecstasy of vision  life unwound
before her a primrose path of dalliance
with such dainty joys at every curve of
the way and butter churning soap
her dwelling place



making and other commonplace tasks
of the household were forgotten

  there came stealing over her in a
warm tide the thick rich love of things
-her own things this gypsy of the
long roads whose possessions hitherto
could be knotted up in a bundle over
her shoulder felt herself one who had
owned always great possessions coming
to her from remote treasure houses of
the ages little wrinkles of worry
seamed her forehead as she considered
how moth and rust do corrupt and
thieves break in and steal

  ill use my things-every last one
o em she nodded a pretty head
golden in the sunshine the best china
an the hemstitched linen an all this
roomll do for just me an ross to eat
in she swept in her glance the big
clean kitchen with its bay window
but if we have just one company
well set out the table in the clock
room

  she flitted over to the window to
straighten a curtain hung awry i
wonder if i could learn to play the
piano her nimble fancy flew along
ross is real tuneful on his fiddle an
if i could twould be complete she
stood still as silence in the middle of
the room one finger on her lip the
other pointing toward the foreroom that
held the mysterious piano

 land o love sil you seen a
spirit

  at the jolly laughter behind the
words silvia sprang around out of her
daydream to face artemesia torrance
standing in the open door

  dinners been a-waitin this half
hour artemesia went on unembar-
rassed by the others short frown-it
took much to dash a torrance-an
ross s gettin more like a bear every
minute i notice there aint a man
body anyhow let him be as soft as
milk that aint riled up if his fodders
kep from him she laughed her deep
magnetic laugh and laid a cordial hand
on the others shoulder

  been viewin the kingdoms o the
earth have ye wish youd a took
me through em with you ive always
heard tell mis wealthy lamay had

sights an sights o handsome things
stored away up here

  not a tinge of envy chilled her warm
voice and just silvia who disliked ar-
temesia her manners and customs
could not hold back a meed of praise
for this even while she answered stiff-
ly i been lookin over a few draw-
ers

  well come along to dinner now or
rossll raise ol hewdie

  laughing in spite of herself at this
outrageous slander upon her amiable
lover silvia followed the other out
the heavy-beamed low old kitchen in
the hollow seemed meaner and darker
than ever silvia longed to take her
cup and plate out under the arbor
mother torrance a heavier flowzier
artemesia greeted her jovially as she
ladled out chicken dumplings

  you been searchin your grand
house from end to end silvy

  i been lookin it over a little
primly

  its a noble edifice an got a mazin
plenishin i make no doubt an im
dretful pleased youve heired it-a lone
girl like you with nobody to fend for
you so to say but for my own part
ive been raised so common all my days
i like to snug me down in a little warm
old burry like this

  im with you ross looked across
the table at her with the slow earnest
smile that gave his face a childlike
sweetness

  a chill little wind rippled over silvia 
suddenly she was tired and out of har-
mony with her new joy she ate her
dinner in silence while artemesia and
her mother chattered away

  with her habitual decision silvia be-
gan at once her settiir out sewing
long white seams under the arbor
where the light played in and out on
her hair and the song of the birds was
like a tune to which her needle kept
time every day she twisted some er-
rand into a secret journey to her own
house there to smile at her treasures
pat their sleek heads and stroke their
glossy backs

  each time she found some fresh


smiths magazine

charm in her house the windows on
the landing that dripped the soft even-
ing light upon the stairs the porch out
of the kitchen chamber where pep-
pers apples and other pleasant stores
could be dried she changed chairs
and tables about to new locations to
prove to herself that they were her
own then set them back because she
was convinced no other plan could be
as beautiful as the one that had first
greeted her heiress eyes

  one delicately scented day of june
when bees were booming in the vines
and the last of the roses were spray-
ing pink-and-white showers over the
paths she took her fine sewing up to
her own house and under the tall lilac
bushes that hid her from the road sat
rocking and stitching in a soft content

  every now and then she laid down
her work to look away across the river
blue as turquoise tranquil as a little
lake or to rest her eyes nearer home
in a fond scrutiny of flower-bordered
paths and aromatic bushes last of all
to dwell upon the tall white house it-
self so deep was her sense of pos-
session that the very river seemed to
call her mistress and to flow steadfastly
by her permission

  all sorts of pretty dreams floated in
and out of her head and visions too
purely sweet to fashion into words
suddenly voices reached her and to
her amazement ross and a strange
man appeared around the corner the
former showed no surprise at sight of
her merely saying

  house open silvy you willin i
should show this gentleman round

  certain ross civilly though in
her heart she thought it cool that he
should not have asked her to do the
honors of her own house who was
this stranger anyhow and where had
the fame of the capn iiolton place
found him

  a longish time passed before ross
reappeared alone now and sank upon
the grass beside her silvias heart
fluttered tunefully as she noted his clean
length of limb and lithe grace his
face usually abstracted and gently
vague was pricked now with alert pur-

poses she reached down a shy hand
to touch his hair with the tips of her
fingers ross seized the little hand
and held it against his lips

   most ready he asked laughter
dancing in his soft eyes

  she did not feign to misunderstand
him blushing prettily and rolling her
work into a modest bundle

  you want to hear bout that man
dear

   course

  hes daniel blackett from beyond
the mill he heard how youd heired
this house an he wanted to see what
fashion o place it was inside for hes
got a cousin up to boston whos all
o a hew to come down here to live
what for that ancient pettipaug
had not yet been invaded by aliens on
strange holidays

   dont know as i can rightly tell
blackett talked bout his farmin an
raisin fancy stock kind o a wild
project for a city-bred chap i view it
but aint anythin to us if hes got the
cash an wants the house

  ivhat house

  why this house blackett thinks
that cousin o his will give a swingein
good price to buy it

  well he cant buy it with an
amused laugh at the foolishness of
folks from boston

  ross stared at her look here
child-what you deem youll do with
it you aint likely to get another such
offer in the course o your whole life
but i dont ever want to sell the
girl laughed again this time because
she was frightened in a queer way

  what in the name o ol farrago
you goin to do with it then  he re-
peated dazed now in his turn

  live in it

  ross rose to his feet impetuously
and strode away across the grass but
in a moment he was back and neither
anger nor chagrin marked his face-
only exceeding gentleness

  you an me are goin to take our
comfort in the old homestead dear
this is a homestead too she flung
back defiance to his gentleness

  you know it aint still with his
her dwelling place



ross put his arm around her shoulders comfortingly

deep tenderness grandsire holton
never lived an hour in it an twas built
a good ten mile from any holton kin
granny didnt prize it really

 did too look how shed come
long up here every time twas her
month

 that was out o contrariness to
grandsire

 think what a handsome great
house it is shifting her ground

  its as good a dwellin as there is
in the county he conceded but it
aint home

  you an mell make it our home
her face was raised to his soft and

flushed and intent he dropped to his
knees beside her and kissed it with a
love like reverence

  our home dear-aint that a sweet
word he stood up again his hand
resting on her shoulder you look
down there silvy

  her eyes followed his pointing hand
to where in a fold of the hills the curl
of smoke from his time-hallowed habi-
tation mounted slowly into the still air

  they were all raised down there
dear he said murmuringly all the
ol lamays that i sprang from-father
an grandsire an all o em-all trained
in the nurture an adminition o the


smiths magazine

lord i aint got a memory o joy or
sorrow nor an experience thats taught
me judgment an manhood that aint
wrought into the walls o that ol house
an see ilis hand still on her shoul-
der he drew her from her seat and
out in the light where far away under
the tall pines the old graves showed
their white memorials

  silvia looked her eyes filming with
bewildered tears yes ross she
whispered

  theyre all there-the worn-out
bodies o them spent an broken with
faithful toil on the land an in the
house for wife and children when im
a-plowin or harvestin in my grain
why i can feel em all round me
watch in me an helpin me an urgin
me to a like steadfastness to my duty
thats what makes a home my dear
not the ownin o grand glitterin gear
his voice broke on the words he
turned from her to hide his face silvia
swayed as if swept by the wind of this
passion yet it was his emotion not
her own that moved her answers-
keen practical-from the sage stores
of common sense crowded to her lips
but love for ross whom she could not
understand silenced her she thrust
her arm in through his timidly that he
might feel her near in actual pressure
at least

  he turned slowly still trembling a
little and putting both arms around
her kissed her with deep feeling
thats a good girl he whispered into
her soft hair

  silvia quivered in fear did lie think
she had yielded 

  that night when they all sat to-
gether on the front steps in the sweet
faint summer starlight artemesia said
suddenly

  ross gid hisler was askin me to-
day when i was over to pettipaug
would you sell him this house for an
ell part to his own which aint large
nough to fit his growin family

  ross blew out a cloud of smoke from
his pipe and watched it drift away be-
fore he answered mildly you tell
him artemesia im a-goin to live in
my own house myself

  well now ross lamay if i was
silvy tate id be switched afore id
give up that reglar palace for this old
contraption

  my country art you do dote on the
sound o your own voice admonished
her mother tartly youd be tickled to
death to own so good a place the
torrances lived in three small rooms
in the house of a cousin

  i should say i would  agreed her
daughter heartily but im talkin
bout silvy here she aint one to be
content long o what id deem plenty
nice nough for me

  oh slio artemesia  silvy aint any
finern her neighbors ross protested
good-naturedly

  silvia sprang up i dont know
bout the rest o you but i got a days
work ahead o me to-morrow good
night her voice sounded quick and
pleasant as usual but in her heart she
raged at artemesia and at ross

  this old shack aint fit for an injin
to live in  she cried furiously to her-
self as she put her candle down on
the dresser before the small blurred
mirror look at this chamber-so low
i have to sit on the bed to brush up
my hair an look at those windows-
crooked as rains horns an the glass all
wavy an no closet to hang my
gownds in-an the floors raised up in
great bumps an evry room down-
stairs as bad i declare for it ross
lamays cracked  with this she flung
her clothes on a chair and sprang into
bed her prayers unsaid her heart a
hot fire of anger

  for a whole week silvia did not go
near her own house her excuse that
cooking for the extra new men come to
help in the haying kept her too busy in
reality she could not bear to see that
palace of fairy while her heart beat out
bitter blood lest she tarnish the glitter
of her treasures

  so hard driving was that week that
saturday afternoon found her still at
her baking the day was damp and
clouded the sun burning through a haze
in a kind of steaming heat more ex-
asperating than the fiercest blaze ar-
temesia and her mother had driven to
her dwelling place



town she was alone and tired to the
point of tremulous rage all day the
work had marched heavily now the
tedious waiting upon the ancient dutch
oven was no longer to be borne if
only she could have baked the bread
and pies in her own smart stove she
rose stiffly from peering into the oven
and jerked a hot moist face around
over her shoulder

  forever ross where you goin

  the young man stood in the door-
way brave in all his meetin clothes
and this the tail of a haying week ite
flushed deep into his neck smiling and
hesitating

  well sil ive got up my spunk to
visit parson card seein to-morrows
the sabbath banns called three sab-
baths a-runnin an then-the weddin
day

  silvia stared at him dumbly he
drew her hot hands up against his
freshly washed cool cheeks

  poor little girl clean beat out
his voice was exquisitely tender

  by a queer jar of the mechanism of
her nature this tenderness stirred her
to rage

  i guess i am beat out the works
ive had over this contrary ol oven

  terble tasty goods come out o it
when tis done he soothed her

  ill take my comfort bakin once
im settled up to my own house with
the good cook stove unappeased

  a startled look flickered over his
face hidden at once by a laugh as he
rubbed her hands up and down his face

  its considble tryin im convinced
o that

  but silvia had caught the glance and
cried out upon him in headlong per-
versity 

  you reconciled you to the idea o
leavin this house ross

 he pressed her to him why
dearie this is my farm my crops are
all in the ground here an my stocks
pastured in the meadows

  your farm runs up to within fifty
feet o my kitchen door

  lets not argue any more silvy he
pleaded tts a dreadful tejus fash-

ion o day nough to get a saint het
up

  she pressed back her head till she
could look into his lowered face

  ross dear she whispered coaxing-
ly you goin to come live in my gran
house when were wedded 

  so still was the room that the creak
of the rusted hands of the ancient clock
the whir of an insect in the bushes the
tinkle of a distant sheep bell were shat-
teringly loud minutes dragged by it
seemed till he answered very gently
no silvia

  she twisted herself free i wont
live here  what you goin to do 
the young farmer seated himself
slowly as if to face a crisis to be met
only by fine patience and deep restraint
silvia seated herself opposite him very
small and stiff her slim feet in their
clumsy slippers set rigidly side by side

  it aint the distance from my work
he began carefully though thats
worth thinkin  a freezin winter
mornin say its the feelin i have for
the ol home why the walls an the
floors are just full to the brim o the
lives o them thats gone before me
whose blood an bone have made me the
sort o man i am

  an pretty walls an floors they are
too she countered him fiercely
crooked an smoke-blackened an sag-
gin manys the time ive liked to get
my death an destruction stubbin up
again a ridge in the floor or slippin
on one o the downhill hollows an
look where i have to work

  she rose and flung open the door
into a dark little pantry dramatically

  the only place  have to keep even
the best china an no cellar have
to haul the milk an butter up out o
the well till my arms are most out o
their sockets an ill thank you to
show me the sink an the pump in this
kitchen 

  it aint modern an up to date her
lover conceded in his unchanging gen-
tleness but aint it a snug warm lit-
tle house though cozy as a burrow
days when that ol town meetin build-
in up theres all ashake with the
wind


smiths magazine

  an the looks o the place silvia
swept on unregarding why im
shamed to have folks see me livin in
this worn-out black tumble-down shel-
ter 

  folks as self-respectin as you
silvy have been proud to live an die
in it he told her somberly

  let em in a reckless rush i
aint when i got me an elegant good
house all full o handsome gear wait-
in for me

  this one looks good enough to me
he admonished his gravity deepening
all the while but ill let that be this
is my home its the place thats seen
my story an the story o all my for-
bears till there aint a board in it but
can tell some word o the old lamays
-how they fought cold an weariness
an dangers an inner enemies too-
covetousness an resentment an wicked
desire-for they were men an women
with hot blood in them-an how they
conquered in the end an died in the
faith theyd kept why child this ol
house you think so meanly of is me i
you tear me out o it an ill die same
as some creature you tear out o his
shell

  the girl stared up into his face in
angry wonder how strange the im-
passioned man how strange the de-
votion to this or any house

  i guess you cant sense how it is
dear he said more quietly youve
got to have been born an raised in an
ol homestead like i have to know

  she flared out upon him  an i was
born under a hedge an never had any
kin o my own  but i tell you i got
a house o my own now an i mean to
live in it too if i have to spend my
days alone

  silvy he pleaded dont run on
so you an me are tokened for life
an parson cards goin to call the banns
to-morrow

  will you live in my house

  his face worked like a childs about
to cry i cant dear

  pier heart quailed before his gentle-
ness more than it would have at rage
not to make me happy rossie

  it wouldnt make you happy he

said with a kind of dogged tenderness
its that makes me hold out id be
a miserable man up to the other house
an id spoil your life so

  its just bein a great grown-up
baby she reviled him

  i know it i aint makin any boast
o it but its the wray im formed
then change the way

  i cant patiently always this
is terble mean sweetheart to you--
dont think i dont sense that-but
twould be meaner yet if i let you tote
me up there an then made you miser-
able it aint that i dont set by you
-i do moren i can tell you in any
words i know this is somethin way
back o that down deep in the blood
twould be like askin me to steal for
you an then be happy afterward

  she laid a timid hand on his shoul-
der we might do like grandsire an
granny-turn an turn about

  no sir writh a sudden snap of
fire they lived down the laugh o
folks for they were two o the most
spirited folks ever born in this town-
ship  but i dont believe youve got the
backbone to stand it an i know  aint
i can bear all pettipaug a-haw-hawin
now rosswaine an silvy have set
a-goin right long in the old folks
tracks same as sheep after a leader
no we got to live right here

  or never wed at all finished silvia
vehemently

  there aint any or dear the
softness of his gaze the deep love in
his voice robbed his words of their im-
perious flavor

  silvia felt her resolution floating
from her in the sea of his devotion

  listen ross i never owned any-
thin in my whole life now i got
somethin that really belongs to me-
cant i be let take my pleasure in it
take all the pleasure youve a mind
to so long as you dont ask to live in
it

  you talk foolish an you act fool-
ish 

 i know i do humbly im
ashamed o it-an yet i aint ashamed
o it either

  the girl opened her lips to answer
hbr dwelling place



when across the turmoil of her spirit
blew a breath of homely daily life-the
odor of burned bread with a cry she
plunged her hand into the ashes
dragged out the forgotten dutch oven
and snatched off the cover all her
saturday baking an ugly black crust
on what a little hinge the gate of des-
tiny swings the sight of her ruined
handiwork seemed to her the culmina-
tion of years of wronged labor all due
to ross sentimental whims

  i view it up an down selfish an
youve got every call to be ashamed o
that

  ross was a sweet-spirited fellow un-
used to give or take sharp thrusts he
winced at the words still more at the
harsh tone

  i wouldnt say things like that if i
was you silvia he warned her his
cheeks hot his eyes very bright

  i will say it an more too thats
my opinion o you an ou might as
well know it right now an you aint
under any obligations to wed me if you
dont feel to

  i do feel to silvy dear girl i do
you listen to me he besought her in
an extremity of distress his hands
reached out to her

  you got to choose between me an
your house which will you take
her face was as scarlet as his and in
her eyes too burned deep fires she
flung the words at him

  you got to choose between me an
your house he answered steadily

  a dreadful silence fell between them
while they measured each other like
wrestlers in a ring she spoke first
high and quick

  i wont give up my house

  his words came draggingly dear
for my sake you know i cant give
up

  they stared at each other two fool-
ish miserable children silvia realized
that in all her wholesome life she had
never before been angry and that it
should be with ross her playmate and
lover

  i wont wed you an if im not
goin to do that i wont live in your

house another minute im goin up to
my own

  she pushed past him flew upstairs
and began to clutch together her few
belongings cramming waists and un-
der garments ruthlessly into a carpet-
bag rolling them into a bundle flinging
skirts over her arm ross stood where
she had left him

  when she came stumbling downstairs
he took the bag and bundle from her
without a word or a look and strode
ahead silvia had such insight into
him from long habit that she knew un-
der his stolid manner was a slow suffer-
ing and a numb acceptance of her will
ross had never been a fighter his
strength was all pressed down into pas-
sive resistance

  when he set her bag down on the
floor of her own kitchen he turned to
her his set unhappy face

  ill send artemesia up after sup-
per

  if you do ill slam the door in
her face she flared at him

  you cant stay here all lone to-
night

  im a-goin to stay here all alone the
rest o my life if i live to be as ol
as granny i might as well begin right
now to get wonted to it

  his answer was to walk out of the
house

  there was  food in the pantry
nor indeed was slivia in a state to eat
it but she found some tea in the caddy
and brewed herself a bitter drink
then she made up her bed in the little
room over the kitchen from which she
could see the chimneys of the house in
the hollow and while the sunset still
reddened the sky went to bed

  she was not at all afraid-there were
no tramps or robbers in that long-ago
pettipaug-but an eerie sense of all the
years past and to come threaded in and
out of her veins till her whole body
twitched she lay with hot eyes watch-
ing the moonbeams shift across the floor
while the eight-day clock boomed out
nine ten eleven midnight

  i wonder if t was to make the room
real dark would i drop off she fol-
lowed the thought out of bed to the


smiths magazine

window there she halted her hand
reached out to the shutter a man had
just slid off her kitchen steps and hid-
den himself in her woodhouse

  there aint anythin but a few sticks
o wood in the shed she told herself
reasonably he must be waitin for
the moon to set fore he breaks in the
house then she scoffed at her own
fears who ever heard o a robber
in these parts its just some fellow
footin it over to candlelight hill an
turned in to rest a spell im a-goin
to find out who tis

  she dressed quickly and started
downstairs in spite of her reasoning
and her stanch courage she found her
heart drumming like a mill race and
her feet creeping stealthily she let
herself out into the mild splendor of
the moonlight and listened pressed
into a shadow neither sight nor sound
came from the woodshed she found
herself longing to be out in the road
running for the safe shelter of home
and ross but to reach the gate she
must pass straight in front of the open
door of the woodshed

  silvia had never been actually fright-
ened in her whole life and quick de-
cision wise or reckless was imperative
in her will now she found herself
cold and damp with fear and waver-
ing like a leaf between the agony of
waiting and the terror of the swift
flight circumstances acted for her
a thin gust of wind blew around the
house and with a sharp clatter banged
to the door she had left ajar behind
her instantly the mans figure ap-
peared at the other door

  she was over the steps in one leap
and running in a frenzy of terror for
the gate it was locked and she could
not find the latch steps thudded be-
hind her she could not escape him
well face him then 

  what you doin in my woodshed
her voice sounded almost cool

  dont be scared its just me

  she could have shrieked with the re-
lease of taut nerves instead she cried
again now fiercely in anger what
you doin in my woodshed

  ross came close to her i couldnt

let you stay all lone in the dark in that
great house he murmured humbly i
thought i was hid but a shutter banged
an i went to see to it an you catched
me

  you cant sleep in my woodshed
every night way into winter

  i guess ill have to if you wont
agree to artemesias company

  i wont let you

  i reckon youll have to dear
silvia sank against the fence ap-
palled his gentleness had an inex-
orableness in it like the flow of the tide
or the fall of the rain she could not
turn him any more than she could those
processes of nature

  silvia cant you stand the poor ol
house if its got me in it wont you
come home to me his voice was
movingly sweet his arms were around
her his breath was warm on her cheek
she trembled with longing to give him
love for his love and yet like a wall
between them was his foolish and self-
ish denial of her comforts and rights

  ross cant you come here for my
sake 

  dear sil its like cuttin off my
hand for you id be maimed all my
life id feel it an youd feel it an
twould poison the sweetness o our cup
o life i would cut off my hand for
you little dear if you needed to have
it so but just for a few trashy things
an a bigger place to swing round in

youd-

  but why do you prize it so-that
old black place she was struggling
in an honest effort to comprehend-
prosaic sense against the poets herit-
ages

  i dont know sil-i dont know
in bewilderment as deep as her own
but its all that makes me the genera-
tions o my forbears strengthenin my
hands for my daily work the ol farms
just me

  she drew awav from him sorrow-
fully i cant ross oh i cant its
so queer in you it sets me against you
most but ill do this for you i dont
want you bangin round all night in my
woodshed an i dont want artemesia
my housemate either-her an me dont
her dwelling place



hit it off real well
-but ill go down
to pettipaug an
ill find me some
good reliable body
to stay long o me
nights-aunt dilly
cappel or ol mis
p u r d y-so you
wont have to pes-
ter yourself bout
me any more
with a great
sigh like a sob
ross accepted his
defeat following
her back to the
house to spend the
rest of the night on
the f o r e r o o in
lounge while sil-
via wearied out
with all the griefs
of the day slept
dreamlessly in her
little kitchen
chamber

she swung herself over the edge of the low porch and dropped to the ground

  summer stole by
on noiseless feet

the delicate vir-
ginal flowers pale
roses forget-me-
nots m a d o n n a
lilies were thrust
out of the garden
by bold hollyhocks
jaunty poppies
and high-spirited
trumpet blooms

then they too had their day and
ceased to be and the hardy marigolds
and asters kept banners of color wav-
ing for a brief season the sedges in
tine marshes by the river burned in red
flames cooled down to umber ashes
blackened and died out 

  the wrangling of insects the drone
of bees the whistle of birds all quieted
into the great silence of fall in the
country only the high lonely cry of
wtild geese flying south pierced the still-
ness at dawn or dusk mornings were
crisply cold evenings the pools glazed
over with a scum of ice winter-snug

housekeeping isolated desolate winter
-was shrouding the country in its long
sleep

  every morning silvia rose with a
brisk affectation of pleasure in her in-
dependence ate her breakfast in the
bow window where once she had
planned to set a table for ross and her-
self and trudged down to pettipaug
at night she trudged back to her warm
kitchen and the widow purdy serving
up a frugal supper for-startling
word to silvia-if man will not work
he shall not eat

  she owned the handsomest house in


smiths magazine

the county set in a noble lawn and a
barn large enough to shelter both
pharaohs lean and fat kine but of
herb or plant fish or flesh to comfort
her hunger she had not one she could
deck herself in ashes-of-roses silk and
serve herself with thin old silver but
truly her feast would be a barmecide
one and it seemed she and the widow
purdy had the appetites of ogres

  as soon as she left his house ross
who although she had always thought
poorly of his practical sense yet in this
stress of change was the one to grasp
the essentials of the situation came up
bearing gifts-vegetables a bag of
flour eggs a ham she accepted them
perforce but she made him understand
that it was only that once-she must
and would stand absolutely alone

  then she went lookin for work-
how it took her back to the roving
meager life of her childhood-and
after many discouragements found it as
clerk in the ladies side of the gen-
eral store of the village

  it was not agreeable to her for she
had the nomads detachment from in-
terest in her kind and it was weariful
for nearly all feminine pettipaugs de-
sires were either down cellar or on
the topmost shelf but it kept fire in
the stove and food in the cupboard

  ross came to see her every saturday
night exactly as if he were a petti-
paug sweetheart courting her but all
his talk was of the farm or the village
life he never spoke of their broken
pledge or of the future yet when he
left he always held her hand in both
of his and looked down into her eyes
with a strength of love and pleading
in his own dark ones that sent her to
bed trembling with a kind of miserable
joy

  artemesia and her mother kept house
for him with a comfortable skill that
left him no longings she knew for her
as a substitute in just material ways
she could not be jealous of the lively
artemesia-unless it were that she se-
cretly guessed both mother and daugh-
ter upheld him in his perversity-for
artemesia was to be wedded herself in
the spring to an up-and-coming farmer

  often in the long november even-
ings silvia pictured them to herself
in the low small kind room around
the kitchen hearth roaring red with
flames popping corn and telling over
old stories broken by artemesias lusty
crow of laughter and ross deep note
then she would look across the stove
at the widow purdy a gaunt silent
woman given to gusty sighs and dole-
ful headshakings and murmur to her-
self this house would be all com-
plete if only ross was up here

  as i view it were in for a snow-
storm the widow purdy remarked on
one of these evenings as she rolled up
her knitting preparatory to going to
bed 

  the widow was always prophesying
storms-it was part of her view of life
-so silvia was not moved by this par-
ticular prediction yet when she went
to fasten the outer door she saw for
herself great drifts of mackerel clouds
and thick rows of mares-tails all over
the sky

  it does look doubersome she con-
ceded to the widow

  an if it comes on for a real snow-
storm ill thank you to tell me how you
callate to het up this monstrous barn
o a place with the little wood you got
in 

  silvia did not answer she did not
know

  she slept soundly all night for she
was tired when she woke the world
lay deep covered in snow which the
wind whirled by her window in fan-
tastic dances there is something sol-
emn in the first storm to country folk
it so definitely sets a seal upon winter
spring is beyond they know and win-
ter itself when it is once accepted as
part of the scheme of things brings its
own pleasures but at the first sight of
the white shrouded fields and hills all
their friendly landmarks blurred out a
sense of desolation of helpless loneli-
ness in a forsaken land darkens over
the spirit of the dwellers in far-away
farmsteads silvia shivered crouch-
ing in her little cotton nightgown
against the window she longed to curl
up again in bed and sleep there till the
hs-r dwelling place



first crocus held up its bright cup by
her fence

  it was sunday no one could be ex-
pected to plow a way through to meet-
in indeed the sextor would not even
light the fires so sure would he be that
the goin wus too tejus for folks to
make it through silvia remembered
other such stormy mornings when
grandsire and ross stamping their
boots and blowing on their reddened
hands dug paths to barn and well and
she and granny gossiping cozily
watched them from the snuggery of the
kitchen before beginning to cook the es-
pecially savory dinner this was a day
to sit by the fire and count your mar-
cies

  yet the middle of the morning found
her fighting her way through the drifts
down into the hollow her ostensible
errand was to carry dinner to old aunt
tempy liggett and her husband uncle
billy really a great restlessness of the
spirit drove her forth the sun had
come out drying the snow into powder
but the wind still roared tempestuously
in their cheerful kitchen bent aunt
tempy and hobbling uncle billy were
entertaining a visitor rosswaine la-
may

  no thank you i cant come in
vsilvia backed away hastily when she
saw their guest i just brought you
down some roast sparerib an a pie
theyre kind o heartenin on a winter
day

  ill go long with you sil ross
announced calmly my folksll be
needin me to keep up the fires

  nodding good-by they started on to-
gether

  pretty rough sleddin uphill ross
remarked then as if no more explana-
tion were needed he thrust a strong
arm in under hers and drew her close
to him

  silvia felt as if they were again boy
and girl coming home from school to-
gether involuntarily she pressed her-
self into the hollow of his arm

  i took down some trade o arte-
mesia to those poor ol folks ross
went on i didnt go to talk business

 the sabbath but uncle billy he
begun on it

  what business she had to shriek
above the wind

  why ive bought his farm-didnt
i tell you  his deep voice was under
the storm he an aunt tempys goin
off to their children over to zoar
what you goin to do with it
turn it into pasture an keep more
cattle twas always a desire o grand-
sires-the two farms lyin side by side
ill turn the house into an extry barn
aint that a kind o a pity-such an
excellent good house as tis-story an
a half an a lean-to

  i dont know how tis sil he told
her humbly grandsire never deemed
i was much o a hand for business an
granny was outdone with me plenty o
times for my slack ways as she called
em but everythin ive undertook has
prospered im makin money an
you want to know how i feel bout it
he halted in a drift i dont give that
for all the dollars in new england
since i cant have the girl i want

  a rush of wind flung her against
him so she need not answer and in
silence they struggled up to her own
door there sheltered by the corner
of the house they stood in a quiet
space catching their breath

  ross turned her around in his arms
and set her in front of him his soft
limpid eyes were piteous with feeling
his serious gentle face atingle with the
beating of his heart silvias own heart
leaped sank halted on its march she
knew herself yielding at last

  when you goin to stop this tom-
foolery o livin up here by yourself an
wed me like you promised  the
words came in a rough angry voice

  it is the ill chance of the mild that
their rare flares of irritation are re-
garded as so out of nature as to be
unjustifiable silvia was rooted to the
ground in her amazement all the soft
languor of surrender left her stamp-
ing her foot on the crisp snow she flung
back at him fiercely

  i aint ever goin to leave my house
long as i can keep the roof over my


smiths magazine

she stumbled around behind the blazing ruins a man staggered toward her

head with a jerk she was free and
flying from him

  all day the wind clashed and boomed
around the house all day the widow
purdy sat by the shining stove and fed
it chunks of wood to keep its heat ray-
ing out into the room to silvia it
seemed burning to ashes all her own
youth and the hopes of it and her
face was pale and set with unhappiness
sometimes she wandered to the win-
dow to gaze out on the still world white
and remote and icy-hearted till the
lonesomeness of it drove her back to
the fire and so the long day wore
itself out

  that night she lay in bed long awake
asking herself ought i to give in to
ross do i set by him enough not
to cast it up at him by an by if i

cant give in to him aint that a proof
i dont prize him like i ought to wed
him 

  dreary questions whose answers
brought no peace finally she slept
only to dream wildly of wrecks by sea
of caved-in mines of lost trails in dark
woods through all which dangers she
toiled after ross gone out of sight
somewhere just beyond

  she woke from one such nightmare
trembling and fevered although she
sat up in bed she could not breathe
something like a great hand clutched
her throat an acrid stifle was in her
nostrils she cast a startled glance out
the window and saw the snow glitter-
ing in a scarlet glow

  widows set the chimney afire she
told herself quietly
her dwelling place



  with calm speed she dressed herself
and opened her door onto the stairs
a thick black cloud rolled in upon her
in which points of red licked up into
her room her candle went out leav-
ing her in utter darkness she slammed
the door pushed up her window and
crawled through it onto the porch roof
the whole kitchen beneath her was a
glare of light flame banners streamed
from the windows

  she swung herself over the edge of
the low porch by her hands and
dropped to the ground unconscious of
the jar as she struck the widow
purdy slept downstairs in a room off
the clock room  she might yet be saved
silvia one cold spot in her throbbing
brain controlling all her acts crashed
in the bedroom window with the handle
of the snow shovel left  the porch

  get up she shrieked above the
roar of the storm and the crackle of
the flames fire fire

 the widow purdy had survived
many adventures in her day she
snatched her clothes and ran for the
front door

  you try to save what you can
screamed silvia im goin for ross
already the air was full of flying
sparks whirled downhill  the gale
and a great brand dashed into the lo-
cust tree by the gate and set its with-
ered branches ablaze the dry pow-
dery snow on roof and floor smoked
and dripped a moment then scorched
away in steam as silvia ran the glow
of the burning house sped ahead of her
in a crimson path across the snow the
distance to the house in the hollow-
only a few rods-was like the trails of
her dream miles upon miles

  the four women and ross worked
steadily to save some of the furniture
for the house itself they knew to be
doomed even if the only well had not
been inside the kitchen silvia flung
far out into the snow linen dresses
chairs pillows whatever came to hand
in the few snatches the heat allowed

  some one came galloping down the
road shouting

  fire fire lamay your houses
afire v 

    

  no one heeded him till he leaped
his horse over the fence in among them

  your own house in the hollers
caught he shouted get down to that
-maybe we can save it

  it was one of the lindley boys from
the only other farm  the ridge his
two brothers and his father rattled up
in a hay cart and all rushed for the
other house a great brand had dashed
against the roof dry with a century of
life dropped onto the shed thick with
dead vines and rolled against the light
arbor at the kitchen door all three
places caught and blazed exultantly

  men and women side by side fought
in grim silence for the life of the old
house passing up buckets of water to
ross on the roof and helping dan
lindley keep the hose on the wood-
shed the well was far from the house
the water low the fire line thin their
labors gigantic savage only delayed
the inexorable fate the old house
dry as tinder seasoned to the core
burned like a royal bonfire

  shes goin it aint no manner o
use to try for her no more cried old
lindley in for the gear boys he
himself dashed into the kitchen now
all alight

  silvia leaned against the fence grasp-
ing the rail with her half-frozen hands
and sobbed in an ecstasy of excite-
ment

  you poor little crittur come down
to my house youre like to drop

  it was aunt tempy from the house
down the road

  a new horror of this mad night
gripped the girl yourhouse afire
she gasped

  aunt tempy pointed to the sky the
freakish wind had altered just half an
hour too late and was driving the
sparks in clouds across the bare plowed
fields toward the woodless mill pond
the barns and stock were safe

  you go right down with aunt
tempy an let her give you some warm
drink a new voice urged silvia peo-
ple had begun to race up from petti-
paug this was parson cards house-
keeper

  silvia looked over her shoulder and


smiths magazine

saw some men carrying out the tall
clock and her grandmothers cedar
chest here was help enough now she
must say one good-by to her own beau-
tiful house she slid out of aunt
tempys grasp and ran heedless of her
tired body back up the hill

  the great house stood out grandly
every line and point cut sharp in scar-
let its center a furnace of gold and
green and crimson a few village peo-
ple stood by the fence powerless to
help watching the fall of the roof
silvia entered the gate up the lawn to
watch apart the ruin of that which had
been at once her high joy and her deep
unhappiness

  sil she heard the shout plainly
for the wind was going down sil
be careful

  ross had followed her running in
long strides his face dark with smoke
tragic with meaning

  dont go near it he called urgent-
ly you cant tell how a walls goin
to strike when it gives way

  a mighty crash drowned his voice
the front wall toppled over silvia
went down on her face under the shock
but she was untouched and on her feet
in an instant ross was gone she

shut her eyes and waves of agony
swept her scorching her like the flames
of the fire she stumbled around be-
hind the blazing ruins a man stag-
gered toward her she sank forward
into his arms and they clung together
tears running down the cheeks of each

  oh rossie i thought you were
killed

thank god silvy youre safe
for a long moment they held each
other his wet cheek pressed down
against her tear-washed one then she
cried tremulously

  rossie dear if i only could id live
in your house to-morrow poor boy-
its dreadful for you iter own loss
was swallowed up in pity for him

  little sweetheart its mighty hard-
your gran house gone he had for-
gotten his pain in hers

  dont you grieve too deep dear
her arms were around his neck we
can live in uncle billys nice house
nothin really counts if weve just got
each other

  thats the word darlin we got
the home o our hearts the other
after all was just a symbol o that the
real thing aint been so much as
scorched by the fire

in arden wood the dreaming trees
were hung with lovers ecstasies

from whittling schoolboys heart and dart
to elder swains delicious art

   that swung light verses on the breeze

hard hard in prosy times like these
to track those steps of poesys

   far from lifes grind and clamorous mart

       to arden wood 

yet while the world goes round the breeze
shall carry lovers whispers tease
girl-ringlets with its breath apart
we lurk we bards and ply our art
in a dream world mid sighing trees

buckie minn stretched his long
legs gingerly out across mother
balers best front-parlor rug and
pushed his big hands down into his
trousers pockets his shrewd gray eyes
turned under their bushy rust-colored
brows to regard the girl beside him ju-
dicially

  jess he said slowly yon got about
as much chance to make a hit down at
miners on amateur night as a lightning
bug has on broadway

  jessie anabel baler slender fair of
hair and of skin pertly pretty flushed
from chin to bangs her blue eyes
opened wide in plain amazement and
the pupils narrowed with an odd sug-
gestion of taking aim for an instant
she held back the breath within her red
lips then it came out with an explosive
little burst of words

  is that so she slightly strained a
normally gentle voice till it broke with
her effort to express high-pressure re-
sentment well say she added

illustrated by e a furman

    thats rough enough even from
    you

      time somebody was rough with
you jess returned buckie slowly
his glance consideringly measuring
her wrath by the signs of her eyes
buckie went to night school at
cooper union and some of his
words were good english also he
had ambitions and a purpose he
worked daytimes and respected
himself so that some of his ideas
were good sense notably this idea
of his that jessie baler the girl he de-
sired to marry was unsuited to the
stage career she coveted and was
doomed to more or less painful disap-
pointment had a foundation in clear-
headed sagacious perception

  you just got a bug thats all he
elucidated you aint the kind that
could get your stuff across oh yes
you can sing-dont get mad-you can
sing and dance pretty good in a par-
lor but ive seen lots of em who
could do that fine who couldnt put it
over the footlights you got some
pretty ways all right but you aint got
the one thing you have to have to make
em go gall-see-just plain gall is
the thing you cant get along without in
that game-and that you aint got-and
im glad you aint too

  his piecemeal lengthening of his sen-
tence more than the substance of it be-
trayed his genuine feeling any one
at all but an angry girl could have seen
that he cared that behind his words was
genuine concern for her and no mere

masculine assumption of superior
knowledge no paltry jealous desire to
be the dictator but jessie anabel
baler had risen to a high degree of
emotional temperature jessie ana-
bel singing and dancing were her pet
accomplishments her ambition to ex-
hibit them in public her long-cherished
project and both were taken very seri-
ously indeed of course she was an-
gry indeed she was furious

  now innately jessie baler was a nice
girl if she had not been buchanan
minn would not have loved her and
she would not have appreciated even in
cooler moments the solid worth of
buckies sort but it is hard to have
your ambitions and your vanity simul-
taneously sat upon by one to whom you
have looked for true sympathy not to
say flattery and jessie had looked not
unnaturally to her lover for exactly the
one if not exactly the other she had
found instead high disapproval of her
little scheme-her innocent plan to try
out her musical and histrionic gifts in
that most obvious of openings for the
beginner furnished by amateur night in
the bowery palace of vaudeville

  im goin on friday night at min-
ers buckie she confided while the
spark waxed in her eyes

  nix was the prompt response

  and from such seed so sown the
disagreement rooted leaved and flow-
ered in a breath

  i am sorry to go without your ap-
proval said jessie anabel with cold
dignity and with her alice lloyd uptilt
of a small chin that was rather too
fetching for real impudence ive made
up my mind that im going on the stage
and i cant get a start anywhere else
if i can make good down there-

  if you can make good down there
interrupted buckie-and then he in-
terrupted himself to wince at the bare
notion of her attempting the thing
jessie anabel was charming close at
hand and under the parental parlor
lamp her eighteen-year-old charms
would even endure daylight perfectly
but they were not of the sort that en-
dure the spotlight

  young minn was not an habitue of

the bowery theaters but his gray eyes
were of the sort that see things not
written on the programs there or else-
where he had seen amateur and other
nights and his impressions amounted to
convictions jessie balers pert girlish
prettiness like her thin sweet little
voice both of which he adored bore
about the same relation to the sort of
thing that would carry in a vaudeville
theater as natural color bears to grease
paint for the same purpose

  he had heard the flatteries of her
other friends but he had seen paral-
lels of her case get into public and he
had never been of the fiber to enjoy the
spectacle any stage at any time would
be bad enough public appearance
anywhere would inevitably bring her
only disillusionment and suffering a
bowery stage on amateur night was 
place for persons possessing less than
positively blatant attractions of voice
and person a girl with parlor notes
and a parlor face compared favorably
in his judgment and metaphor with a
canary at a band concert and an audi-
ence at miners is something more than
ruthless

  hence he set his face stonily against
her project and said all these things
aloud as well as he knew how with his
cooper union schooling

  jessie anabel was surprised but
she knew her young swain well enough
to be quite sure that he was wholly sin-
cere and that he was about as likely to
change an opinion of this sort as he was
to start smashing the baler furniture
so determined none the less she gave
her olga petrova shrug and ceased
argument

  that means youll do it anyhow
doesnt it  queried buckie slowly who
felt as only a sweethearts shrug after
serious argument makes a man feel

  of course answered jessie did
you think you could stop me

  well said her youthful lover
gravely i sort o hoped so

  well you cant responded jessie
anabel she rose from her end of the
settee and crossed to the piano she
sat down with attempt at careless non-
chalance but the face she turned back
the debut of buckie minn



to him was hot with angry blood hav-
ing given tongue to the beginnings of
wrath she had quickly arrived at the
stage that she might have described as
good and mad and she added
with spiteful venom if this is what
you come up here for you might a
stayed away you can stay away next
time

young mr minn stared an instant
slowly he drew his big hands out of

well he commented maybe you do
then but you aint goin on at min-
ers he ended firmly

 the girl forgot her music and turned
 in amazement i aint

buckie minn shook his head at her
wide blue eyes no he replied dis-
tinctly

well exclaimed jessie anabel
well wholl stop me

 i will replied buckie

jess he said slowly you got about as much chance to make a hit down at miners on amateur night

as a lightning bug has on broadway

his pockets and pulled in his long legs
he stood up and walked slowly across
to the piano

  you dont mean that do you jess
he inquired gently

  yes i do she averred beginning
to play ma mississippi sue while she
grinned at the piano keys a wicked lit-
tle grin of triumph over the notion that
she held this big chap by her side be-
tween finger and thumb

  buckie regarded her seriously

  the girl got up from the piano stool
and faced him for a moment half
daunted then she laughed with a
sudden little watchful snicker you 
she ventured semicontemptuously as
he remained undisturbed by that she let
her anger flame you think you can
boss me well i guess not

  not boss no jess answered her
lover just stop you from foolishness
-and from gettin hurt

  fair little miss baler grinned at him


smiths magazine

as long as she could stand his gaze
then she dropped down at the piano
again and took up the neglected thread
of ma mississippi sue buckie minn
turned slowly away and to the door of
the baler front hallway well then
good night jess he said and went
out

  the girl at the piano stopped playing
again suddenly as she heard the out-
side door close she jumped to the win-
dow and peered over the inside blinds
she caught her breath quickly as she
saw him pass the street light at the cor-
ner and strike across the square then
abruptly she turned back and threw
herself down on the vacant settee and
burst suddenly into hysterical tears

  whether or not jessie anabel would
carry out her rash intention buckie
minn was in doubt shocked at first
by the announcement of her notion he
found it easy later to see how and why
the idea tempted her she believed in
her powers that belief bolstered by
the flattery of foolish inexperienced
friends might carry her far buckie
was hurt by the way his kindly meant
opposition had been received but he
was not the sort to let pique interfere
with his effort to save jessie a painful
experience pain for her would be the
only result of her misguided attempt
ne was sure and pain for jessie anabel
was something more to buckie minn

  that was why when friday evening
saw the gathering of ambitious ama-
teurs at the stage door of miners bow-
ery theater there appeared among
them a tall long-legged big-handed
young man who gave his name as bu-
chanan and his specialty as tumbling
-to constitute a passport to those mys-
terious regions behind the scenes

  herded with the rest who were to
offer their callow stunts before the most
ruthlessly critical audience in the world
he was directed to the semidark space
bounded by whitewashed brick walls
and the back of the final set for the
evenings professional show to await
his turn for his debut and with seem-
ingly morose and obviously watchful
taciturnity he planted himself against
a convenient scene brace and waited

  buckie still half believed that jessie
anabel would not come lie wanted to
believe it for if she stayed away it
would be equivalent to a tender of the
olive branch between them and
buckie minns heart was sore and lone-
ly for his girl if she did not appear
he would have a right to think she
cared after all for what he said and
thought and he could go straight back
to her and find again what he had had
before and what he was loath to do
without

  so it was with a lightening heart that
he looked about him in the bare and
disillusioning place at the back of the
stage while the roaring final chorus of
the professional musical show was in
progress just the other side of the
flimsy set he did not see her among
the giggling girls and intently sober
boys who were gathered to offer their
untried wares she was not there if
she were intending to carry out her pur-
pose she would certainly have arrived
by this time she was not coming

 the chorus outside ended the
storm of applause with which the au-
ditors beyond greeted the end of the
show rose in a crashing din then faded
as the curtain sank between it and
buckie minn then rose and sank again
for an after call or two then sudden-
ly the scene set back of which the
young fellow stood was struck and he
found himself behind the main curtain
only on the wide open stage which
looked big and hollow enough to swal-
low all the rather forlorn little bunch
of amateurs

  and buckie commenced looking the
latter over with a new eye to their for-
lornness as his hope began to take sure
hold of his mind he began to pity
them too instead of himself and jessie
anabel they were about to go through
what he had feared for jessie some
of them would suffer rather cruelly
but she would not-and the fact that
she would not meant much to him

  the sceneshifters were setting up a
curious structure in the first grooves
it was a wall-like affair but pierced
with many openings which were in
turn covered with curtains half doors
the debut of buckib minn



pliable strips and similar veiling or con-
cealing but unsubstantial barriers
one of them was a full-sized door
hung on a pivot near the center from
top to bottom so that a push on the
upper half would cause it to swing in-
ward behind this and some of the
other larger openings in the scene mat-
tresses lay upon the floor and while
the novice observed two or three stout
fellows appeared armed with slap-
sticks pillowlike bags stuffed with
feathers and other implements of curi-
ous nature and for purposes more or
less obscure

  one of these wielded a long pole at
the end of which was a loop perhaps
of heavy wire bound with protecting
cloth and large enough to go about a
corpulent human body lie waved it in
unholy glee at the little group of ama-
teurs and buckie minn recognized it
soberly it was the hook-with which
the unlucky candidate who failed of fa-
vor before the footlights would be un-
ceremoniously removed on demand of
his audience get the hook or just
plain the hook is the damning cry
of the displeased gallery gods and their
will is the law of amateur night like
the crowd in the ancient roman amphi-
theater they hold the power of life and
death-for budding dramatic aspira-
tions get the hook is their thumbs
down and many an innocent is thus
slaughtered to make a bowery holi-
day

  nervousness was abroad but buckie
did not feel it he watched others of
the little group about him crowd for-
ward to the peepholes in the set as the
curtain went up and the announcer
came from the wings to make his bow
and give the name of the first aspirant

  the first performer  the pro-
gram buckie heard the penetrating
voice of the announcer say is joseph

bailey a- he paused with a long

hold on the article and a roar came up
from the house

  singar-r-r

  they are good guessers-also they
are well informed regarding their ama-
teurs these bowery audiences so
they do part of their own announcing

  buckie himself had now no thought
of remaining to see the show out he
had never had an intention to perform
lie knew a place to which he wanted to
go-some one he wanted to see but
his curiosity was stirred by this unusual
inside view of a thing familiar from the
front he found his way to a peephole
in the set as joseph bailey sing-
ar-r-r debouched from the left first
entrance

  then he watched while the orchestra
began joseph baileys music and the
soloist struck his first note and
buckie minns own heart jumped as he
stared into the hundreds of yellow
hazy intent half-laughing only half-
seen faces beyond the blinding foot-
lights he only vaguely heard joseph
baileys first effort which soared brave-
ly cracked and failed but he saw the
instant wild laugh burst like a scorching
flame from the yellow faces out there
in the dusky auditorium and heard the
pitiless din of hoots and screams for
the hook

  theres no chance for a weakling at
miners buckie winced to the soul as
his thoughts ran back to jessie anabel
and her thin little voice thank for-
tune she had taken his warning

  one of the stout fellows behind the
set dropped his slapstick and burst
through an opening at hand and out
upon the stage another ran around
the end of the scene they approached
the unlucky singar-r-r from side and
rear they assaulted him they lifted
him bodily and next moment to the
accompaniment of yells of joy from
the audience he came headfirst through
the upper half of the turning door and
landed in a discomfited and disconsolate
heap on the mattress behind it

  buckie laughed a little lie did not
care much how rough a tough young-
ster like joseph bailey might find it
but for girls-of course they wtould be
less violent with feminine failures on
the stage but the best was pretty
strong as for jessie anabel-well
she had not come he wondered rather
surprisedly why he had not thought of
proposing that she see this thing from
the audience as a means of curing her

ambition before he had antagonized her
by fixed opposition

  a girl came next she sang she
had a big voice that would have ranked
as contralto had its quality been some-
what further removed from a motors
honk but she got away with it-
which means that she pleased the
audience applauded  dimes and nickels
and quarters came sprinkling surpris-
ingly down upon the stage about her as
she delightedly responded to recall
and she came off stage with a handful
of jingling change and with a new set
of the lips and a conscious droop of the
eyelashes over flushed cheeks that spoke
volumes about a future made or marred

by the little event
which was trifling to
every one else but
her

  after that the hook
itself was adminis-
tered to a youngster
who undertook with
elaborate preparation
to introduce an exhi-
bition of legerde-
main his tricks
were mostly gestures
and though he pro-
duced handkerchiefs
fro m empty hats
flags of all nations
from a burned basket
and even a rabbit
from a bowl of water
he didnt last he
produced besides only
brief mirth and no
astonishment at all in
the spectators he
came off stage by way
of a slit in a painted
store front and land-
ed on his ear on the
pad behind

  following these be-
ginnings a girl was
hooked a darky buck-
and-wing dancer
made good an irish
monologue artist
met his waterloo by
means of the slapstick
and the half door-though he actually
put up a fight to save himself the ig-
nominy

  but buckie tired he wanted to see
jessie anabel therefore he buttoned
his overcoat and made for the stage en-
trance he felt no need for ceremony
in taking his departure and one more
minute or fraction thereof would have
seen him off through the night but in
the half light behind one tall standing
scene piece he came suddenly upon a
small figure apart and alone that
stopped him short in his tracks

  she was masked but buckie was
sure the instant he looked into the eyes
behind the holes in the fabric

he gave his specialty as tumbling
the decbut of buckie minn



  jess lie cried at her

  she looked up at him for a single in-
stant as if too much surprised at his
presence there to-credit her eyes then
she dodged away from him and ran
around the scene with a nimble-footed
skip that easily gave him the slip

  buckie minns blood surged up into
his head and ran hot there but buckie
stopped to think she was in gala
clothes-a homemade sort of imitation
of a show girls toggery her hair was
puffed and powdered that much he
had anticipated but the mask was a
touch he could not have foreseen and
somehow it gave him a shock even
greater than the sudden encounter it-
self he could not have told why but
it half enraged him it stirred a pas-
sion of dumb remonstrance against
what she was doing

  his hope that she cared for what he
thought was dashed of course so was
the happy feeling that he could go home
to her and to the old relation he
faced now a worse situation than when
he had come to the theater she was
defying him his wishes his warnings
his earnest request and the way she
had run from him showed perfectly that
she had  feeling about it except to
follow her own purpose

  there was a little sense of sickness
upon buckie minns spirit for a mo-
ment then he roused himself slowly
turned and rounded the scene and felt
determination coming back upon him
she should not do it he would not let
her she was a little fool all right but
he loved her and he would not see her
suffer-would not allow her to be ill-
treated by that bunch of hoodlums out
there in the pit nor by this strong-arm
squad of bouncers on the stage itself
he knew her powers he knew exactly
what would happen and with fresh
impressions gained from others ex-
periences within the last ten minutes he
grew furious in advance at the thought
of what would be hers he would go
to her and take her away by force from
it all he would-

  but he stopped short at that point in
his resolutions he had come in range
of the front of the stage with a full

view of it from the wings he heard
the end of the announcers brass-voiced
enunciation of some fanciful false
name and he saw the flirt of a skirt
the gleam of fair hair out there and
realized that the girl-his girl whom
he had come there to meet and stop in
this mad undertaking-was already be-
fore the audience

  buckie minn had a moment of blank
so far as he could ever afterward re-
call then he turned slightly giddy
and reached out to steady himself
against the brick wall next to the elec-
tricians switchboard next second
however he was clear-headed enough to
hear a thin piping little soprano voice
starting to sing out there in front and
to see albeit dazedly a slender little de-
fense ess-looking form posturing in its
semidisguising frippery and then the
inevitable began to happen there was
a raucous call from the gallery a yip
and a yelp and the house went off into
guffaws meows hissings

  the hook-hook hook hook get
the hook  the hook  get the hook 
came the hilarious cries they were
like lashes on the raw to buckie minn
in an instant he was maddened by them
a red-coated figure of a bouncer started
out from the set behind the singer and
made for her with arms spread buckie
saw him

  and then something happened that
was not nor ever has been before or
since on the program of a bowery
theater a young man with very
bright hot eyes long legs and very big
hands shot out from the wings as if
he had been thrown upon the stage he
caught the stout little bouncer by the
scruff of the neck and heaved him bod-
ily from the floor with a twist and a
toss he sent the squirming sputtering
red figure through a place in the back
that looked like a manhole in a pave-
ment then very straight and very
tall and apparently almost unconscious
of the big audience that was shrieking
appreciation of this innovation behind
him he turned on the shrinking girl as
if he were going to devour her

  come away he cried what did
you do it for didnt i tell you what


smiths magazine

would happen  come away they
shant touch you  ill beat their damn
heads off if they do ill kill em
come-quick

  the howling people in pit and gallery
did not hear him but no bowery au-
dience could fail to see genuineness and
character in such a scene also the
followers of vaudeville are swift to
scent a novelty half convinced of a
clever hoax in form of an act intended
to entertain half puzzled by the curious
power of the scene they suddenly
stopped yelling the whole hot to-
bacco-hazy auditorium fell under a
hush like the hush on the stands at a
pop fly with the bases full

  in the sudden stillness buckie minns
voice boomed out clear why did you
come couldnt you believe me did
you have to try it for yourself

  pie went forward with a hand out to-
ward the girl

 keep away what do you want
you let me alone came the thin little
answer

  but both voices carried the power of
absolute sincerity the audience was
breathless the girl shrank back
against the set then started to creep
away the man sprang forward and
caught her arm and held her he had
no consciousness of any other exit from
the place than the way he had come in
he meant to take her that way

  she struggled for an instant like a
frightened little kitten and one yelp of
joy went up from the scats then the
man put out a big arm and gathered
her in close to him and turned and the
mob went silent again when all at
once the big fellow seemed suddenly
to realize the stillness and the attention
centered upon him and looked out
across the footlights his jaw sticking
out and his free hand clenching some-
thing in the temper of him caught them

  there was a yell of approval from
somewhere in the back of the house
then a couple of men in the gallery be-
gan to beat their hands together wildly
the thing spread like the flaming laugh
buckie minn had looked upon a tu-
mult began to mount cheers burst
out a man down in front leaped to his

feet and shouted hoarsely and waved
his hat and in another instant half
the men in the lower part of the house
had followed suit the clamor became
an uproar that shrewd-eyed crowd
had seen a thing that touched its primi-
tive sensibilities and it knew how to ex-
press appreciation -it bellowed in riot-
ous emotion 

  the girl under buckie minns arm
trembled as he led her off at the exit
she clung to him she was sobbing
she tried to hide her poor little masked
face against his breast he moved to-
ward the alley door but she shrank
against him and stopped him the man-
ager was running after them he
seized them and shouted for them to
wait

  here dont go he cried good
god dont you know theyll give you
the prize for that listen to the money
hit the stage out there whats the
matter with you boobs  go back and
get your coin-wait and get the prize
the girl suddenly straightened and
stiffened she stopped sobbing and
raised her head listening to the still-
howling house and to the spat and ring
of falling silver then abruptly she
laughed with an hysterical little gurgle

  oh sure she cried its so
come on-its so

  but buckie minn stood still for a
second he stared at her then he swore
softly and reached out with a motion
too quick for her to dodge he
snatched the flimsy mask from her face
and looked down into the flushing star-
tled countenance beneath next mo-
ment he gasped and swore again the
face was one he had never seen before
in his life

  he shook her off and whirled away
his brain was dizzy with the shock he
could hardly imagine the thing that had
happened to him he made again for
the door

  immediately the manager with busi-
ness instinct to give his crowd its way
seized his coat and shouted at him
the prize you mutt its ten dollars-
dont you want it

  prize-hell snarled buckie tear-
ing himself loose then swinging to-
the debut of buckie minn



go back and get your coin-wait

and get the prize

ward the girl with a sneering bitter
laugh he pointed into her tear-wet
greedy face give it to her

  he reached the cold darkness of the
alleyway a moment later scarcely
knowing what he thougnt he staggered
down its length to the street then he
turned blindly toward home running
into people cursing them and himself
muttering like a man in a whisky craze

she had looked like jessie in figure-
and he had been excited how else the
thing could have occurred he could not
understand he had been sure-abso-
lutely unquestioning-about the girls
identity and he had been utterly
fooled he was simply astounded-
helplessly amazed

but he had not taken a dozen steps
before he felt his arm seized a voice

the most famous heels of modern times

airs charles anthony of muncie indiana is famous everywhere
newspapers are read because of the fact that occasionally when other
effects in dress do not appeal to her she appears in gold slippers that have diamond
heels incidentally it might be mentioned that she has six pairs of this foot-
wear each pair having heels worth two thousand dollars-which is pretty good
evidence that the story about cinderella was rather an unimportant and insignifi-
cant affair

     the manner in which mrs anthony tripped up the ladder of fame on the
be jeweled heels is interesting she first wore them at a reception at the white
house in washington and only one newspaper woman mrs vylla poe wilson
noted their splendid effect keeping her information to herself mrs wilson had
a talk with mrs anthony and found out that the wealthy woman had to keep
her ballroom slippers in the safe of any hotel at which she stopped they were
not exactly shoes to set outside the door for the hall boy to shine up during the
night

     moreover mrs wilson scooped the whole newspaper fraternity on that
story

most of us arc afraid of our shadows isnt that
so we dont care so much for what we are
as for what we appear and the shadows that
we cast to impress the world are our dearest treasures

  let me start over with white duck trousers white
duck trousers may not seem closely related to the start
already made but the thought stretches back taut and
straight far into the past robert louis stevenson spent
a year upon one short essay i have spent a dozen upon
this it may not be worthy of such lineage yet the fact
remains that many small things have required great ef-
fort and that writers earn their keep

  permit me to return to some white duck trousers of
a year a d we were a party of city youth-save one
-gathered together on the first of july an extremely
hot night garb conventional chicago spring garb ex-
cept in the case of that ill-advised wight above denoted
a stranger from the rural districts lie was all glorious
in white ducks fancy white ducks on the first of
july

  he was beautiful and cool we in chicago spring at-
tire as light of weight and feeling as we dared to make
it were unlovely and broiling he apparently reveling
in his superiority of physical condition and seemingly
all innocent of impropriety we must take him down a
peg particularly as he had the eyes and ears of the girls

  so we seized opportunity

  er-are they wearing white ducks already where
you come from we queried-of course not in chorus
but by spokesman

  why certainly its been plenty hot enough for two
weeks dont you think so

  ya-as but ou know nobody in the city wears
his ducks until the fourth the fourth of july is the
time we all have our ducks but we dont wear em yet
season hasnt begun

  he flushed but he was stanch

  i dont care boys summers here and this is as
hot weather as well have so i put mine on whats
the sense in waiting
  nevertheless we believed that we had the morale
over him and we might stalk about sweltering but tri-
umphant

  this was a dozen and more than a dozen years ago
i have lost track of the youth but i have not lost sight
of the incident to make a better story i should assert
that he wore those white ducks out of independence in-
stead of common sense that attracted by his independ-
ence i have watched his course and that he now is pres-
ident of the united states or of the pennsylvania rail-
road but he didnt i didnt he isnt and so i shant
lie wore the ducks through inclination and ignorance
they and he have passed on beyond the horizon and only
the truth remains what fools we mortals be

  looking back into the dozen years i know that we
pert young cityites in that party were a set of callow
cads we fairly-and literally-itched to don comfort-
able ducks but we did not venture to anticipate the pre-
scribed season by as little as three days and we were
proud of the conventional shadows that we cast we
were all for mental effect not for material well-being
the shadow not the substance and only in variety of
foolishness did we differ from the average run of people
old or young

  dare to be yourself directs a philosopher which
self the great majority of humanity have three or
four selves to use on selected occasions a self to the
rich man and a self to the poor man a self to the over-
man and a self to the underman a self to husband or
wife and a self to society or client so many investitures
do we employ that the true self is rather difficult to pick
so i suppose that we should choose the best of the selves
and stick to it then arises the question which is the
best self-the best for me and the best for others and
then again arises the query which is the genuinely most
widely best 

  let us wade out and begin once more as the old
quaker was fond of saying all the world is crazy
except me and thee-and sometimes i suspect that thee
is a little queer but i do not claim that of the white-
ducks coterie i am the one who has emerged from fool-
ishness i only know this that the world values the
man or woman who fears not to be natural if the
world also dares to be natural it values the natural sin-
ner over the artificial saint however we need not carry
the argument so far
  without standing before the mirror-save as a whole-
some reminder-we easily can conjure up many a person
who makes a practice of not being himself or herself
for instance there is the aping of others i recall an
acquaintance who imagined that he looked like napoleon
bonaparte he -spent most of his time in posing in a
tricorn hat with chin in and hands behind him but he
wasnt napoleon for he didnt accomplish anything he
may have had napoleons profile he didnt have the
brains behind that profile this is the weakness of many
apers

  the world is full of amateur napoleons washingtons
lincolns websters ingersolls henry georges et cet-
era et cetera and of poseurs lesser who by the shadows
that they cast would give out the impression that they
are what really they are not and that they know what
really they dont know some are too careful even to
laugh lest they break the combination

  i have in mind a pleasant and pleasing friend whose
business is promoting properties of the unhatched stage
fie cant for the life of him evidently to me or to any-
body put a proposition by his natural self i know his
real self at least his domestic self which is pretty
pearly a real self but his business self in no wise re-
sembles it as soon as he starts in on a topic of pro-
motion he loses the jekyll and becomes the hyde ilis
face contorts his lips purse he makes eyes and blinks
profoundly he deals out resounding words and waves
his hand and as he is a little man the fashion sets not
happily upon him i more than suspect that he prac-
tices in the glass and i am certain that he has adopted
face and gestures of another promoter who is a hand-
some success in the role

  my friend could interest me much more quickly if he
quit thinking upon his effect and thought more upon his
topic i can see how he won his wife for he is a very
lovable chap but i dont understand how he can sell any-
body a five-dollar gold piece for a five-cent nickel

  yes the world is full of pretense of beg pahdons
uttered apropos of nothing of superfluous do writes
do calls and flourishes courtesy and civility and
kindness are the precious oils that anoint the wheels of
life but when we apply them for ourselves rather than
for other people we misuse them

  some of us may not ape but do we cringe i won-
der if one out of one hundred men and women in mod-
erate but independent circumstances when seeking prof-
itable notice can walk into a magnates office and accost
him with the naturalness that would be deemed the meed
of an ordinary stranger or an equal friend not for a
moment i dont say that i can a fellow has a hat-
in-hand hair-plastered extra-polite feeling i dont
mean a doggish cringing attitude a mans a man for a
that-and so is a woman but it isnt the natural spon-
taneous self its a self in leash and conscious that here
is somebody who must be treated to a special self

  very probably that magnate or other great personage
is one of the most natural individuals alive if he is truly
great he surely is natural for the greater the real self
the more it crops out he therefore is the very person
who appreciates naturalness in others

  an acquaintance asks us to dine with him come
along up to dinner well give you whatever we usually
have ourselves if youll take potluck and make one of
us youll be welcome that sounds good and cordial
and so we go the odds strongly are that the wife will
be notified by phone and will hustle around and cook all
kinds of extras and that our host will stop on his way
and hurriedly buy a quart of ice cream  and this foils
us we are uncomfortable but in case that it actually
is potluck and nothing else-no frills-how pleased and
complimented we are

  why wouldnt it be worth trying a little oftener to
compliment our fellows with potluck of self  to favor
them with the ordinary self of everyday it seems to
me that we should make quite a hit in business and so-
ciety and besides it would raise the standard of selves
we wouldnt risk a shoddy self for fear of being con-
demned any more than the canny housewife with gen-
erous husband would risk a soiled tablecloth for fear
of being caught

  that real self which so many of us jealously keep con-
cealed and of which we are even ashamed because it is
so tender or in our limited sight so foolish is the self
that when possessed by others has given to the world
the highest achievements of science art progress and
happiness if we only knew it is the self that would
command the respect and homage that we so desire and
i say let loose of it for i believe that our real self is
the best self although we may not be aware of it our-
selves

holm an
f day

                     illustratki by victor p e r a r d

time a particularly salubrious
morning in early june

         place the selectmens office
in the scotaze town house

  characters  deck capn aaron
sproul chosen the day before-despite
his protests and his private convictions
regarding the matter-chairman of the
general committee in charge of sco-
tazes fourth of july celebration
entitled panoramic pageant of prog-
ress  miss flobelle ilanks profes-
sional promoter of pageants

  miss hanks loquitur im so glad
to see you around bright and early for
this first conference of ours capn
sproul im sure we shall get on to-
gether lovely now our first work of
course will be to stir up all the interest
we can in this thing thats coming off
note in regard to miss hanks she
was a cousin of mrs lycurgus snell
president of the scotaze daughters of
liberty and therefore came to town
with a bit of a pull when she proposed
to get up a pageant for a certain per
cent of the gross received for church
dinners and the evenings entertain-

ment the daughters of liberty roped
in the parish-aid societies and the rest
of the womens organizations and a
delegation of fifty matrons led by the
capns wife fairly picked the capn up
and thrust him into office

  with the preamble thus stated for
mutual understanding we may hasten
into the story

  capn sproul did not seem to be in-
fected by the brightness of the morn-
ing or to partake of the breezy cheer of
miss hanks he stared solemnly at
her

  i say we must get everybody in this
town just as interested in us and our
plans as they can possibly be-that will
be our first work repeated miss
hanks

  knowing this town better than you
do marrn i shall have to differ with
you about getting everybody interested
there are some men in this town that
better be kept out even if we have to
take and dull their interest with a rock

  i dont understand pleaded miss
hanks her blue eyes wide open

  i haint got time to go into full de-


smiths magazine

tails and if i did youd throw up the
job-heave the thing over the rail and
dodge out while the dodging was good
confided capn sproul sourly i have
been dragged into first one thing and
then another in this town-just like ive
been shanghaied into this thing against
my best judgment-and i know what
usually happens some men begin to
take too much of an interest in whats
going on-want to grab in and help too
much

  why i really dont see how a gen-
eral spirit of helpfulness is going to
harm a public project like this sir

  mebbe not you have to find out
about it the same way i did

  but please give me a few hints now
that we are just starting for its al-
ways essential to start out right you
know i have never lived in this town-
i dont know the people

  it aint much use to hang out storm
signals now so far ahead inarm you
never know how quick the wind will
change in this town all we can do is
wait and worry

  but you can at least give me some
idea-some hint if we are to work to-
gether i think you ought to be very
frank and outspoken

  i haint never been accused of being
tongue-tied when it comes to a pinch
ill be outspoken enough marm when
it is time to speak for instance when
that jared grant sparks comes in here

and offers to play a guitar solo ill-

  but mr sparks has already volun-
teered to play at the evening entertain-
ment and i have accepted him with
thanks

  the capns eyes narrowed balefully
there you go at the start with one
of that bunch that will put a hoss knot
into the running rigging of anything
that comes off in this town he only
knows one tune and thats the angels

serenade and-

  thats a very beautiful selection
well no audience in this town has
ever found that out from jared grant
sparks playing of it you cant hear
anything five feet away from him if
theres anything any worse its to

listen to a pome by that long-haired
tufted lioudan of a consetena tate
but one of the ladies of the auxili-
ary said that mr tate wrote beautiful
poetry and he has already started in
 one at my personal request really
capn sproul i hope you are not un-
duly prejudiced both of those gentle-
men showed so much interest that i
was quite taken with them

  does a hossfly show interest in a
blind mule whose tail is too short to
reach the juicy spot demanded the
capn irefully

  i cannot say that your metaphor is
very elegant reproved miss hanks

  it wasnt planned to be marm it
was one to fit my notion of the sub-
ject if interest has gone as far as
yon say it has in this thing i suppose
you have put the scotaze ancient and
honorable firemens association down
for a free feed on your programmy to
pay them for parading them grass-
hoppers usually are the first to have in-
terest break out in em and youve
probably let hiram look start in get-
ting up a circus end of the show-and
if anything he gets up aint dynamite
with a short-time fuse hitched to it
then may tar never stick to a portygee

and youve probably arranged-

  just one moment capn sproul
you mustnt start in by quarreling with
me i cannot be expected to know all
about your local prejudices mr
sparks and mr tate are on the pro-
gram-and im quite sure they will do
nicely but i know nothing about your
firemens association or about mr
look i do not know the gentleman
then the proposition aint quite so
dead as it might be admitted the
capn exhibiting a bit more optimism
but dont go to having false hopes that
he aint going to show interest flell
be around pretty quick but im on
the job now and that may help some
sparks and tate dodged in ahead of
me but well see what can be done
about pickpoling off the rest of these
interested parties

 i never heard a man talk so
strangely before about public interest
stated miss hanks thats what i al-
warming over the milish



ways strive for first-i base my suc-
cess on getting public interest started

  gapn sproul had no further oppor-
tunity just then to express his opinion
on the dangers of public interest in
scotaze colonel gideon ward his
brother-in-law came in

  colonel ward nodded stiff greeting
to the capn for some time the rela-
tions between them had resembled an
armistice in which both parties had
clung to their weapons the colonel

one by one and draped them over a
chair

  blue coat with buff trimmings he
announced red belt and a green baize
vest white pants tall flaring
chapeau and a red pompom on it
there they are-and i tell you miss
itanks we made a pretty scrumptious
showing at the old muster days where
the hard cider flowed like water in a
tailrace and gingerbread was piled sky-
high now i think i can scare up fifty

but youve got to have something besides a matched game of jackstraws and a potato race ginger it

up-ginger it up

began to unwrap a parcel that he had
brought under his arm and addressed
his remarks to miss hanks

  i reckon that this pageant if my
wife tells me right is going to be some-
thing in which i can take personal in-
terest averred the new arrival
when i was young the big institution
in these parts was the old militia-the
milish the boys used to call it all the
leading citizens belonged i was colonel
in it ive brought one of my uniforms
that has been laid away in camphor
how delightful cried miss hanks
the colonel snapped out the articles

and mebbc a hundred of the members
of the old milish in these parts who
have saved their uniforms like i have
saved mine

  this is a perfectly wonderful find
purred the promoter oh i do hope
that you mean by showing interest that
youll take part in the street pageant
guess its only necessary to ask us
officially stated the colonel very gra-
ciously

  capll sproul was displaying a sur-
prising indifference he took a look
at the garments on the chair shoved
his hands deep in his pockets and


smiths magazine

walked over to the window turning his
back on the colonel

  capn sproul i want you to confer
with colonel ward on this matter said
miss hanks

  i refuse to be drawn in replied
the capn with much positiveness

  but why

  let him tell you

  i dont care to do any business with
that person miss hanks declared the
colonel tartly it was a mistake to
put him on the committee

  you and me agree on that point-
and its the only thing we ever did agree
on commented the capn without
turning his head

  im willing to enlist under your ban-
ner pursued the colonel with a gal-
lant bow ill do my best to get the
others to join in with me if we can
do all our business with you personally
miss hanks but i have had a lot of
trouble with that person over there ill
admit that he is my brother-in-law but
i have always been perfectly frank in
saying that he pushed his way into my
family against my desires i want you
to know it as a stranger in our town
every time i have tried to do business
with him there has been trouble
three clinches two jawing matches
four free fights and a riot tabulated
the capn

  but im not going to be kept out of
a public duty-so i consider it-by this
person so long as i can do business with
you i say again im much interested
in this proposition of the pageant

  do you remember what i was just
telling you about interest miss hanks
demanded the capn facing about
nows your time to put your foot
down

  you are so ungracious that you
fairly shock me protested the pro-
moter im rather blunt myself
sometimes in expressing my opinions
capn sproul i cannot understand why
so many of the ladies were anxious to
put you at the head of the committee
its because they know what some
of these other critters in this town
would do if they had the handling of
tilings stated the capn not flinching

under the scowl of his brother-in-law
hiram look would have arranged for
a rooster match a prize fight and a cir-
cus show peppered up with bunko steer-
ers and skin games i never heard any-
thing about this milish business before
for i havent lived in this town all my
life but if it is anything that gid
ward recommends it will be like wheel-
ing a powder keg into tophet-some-
thing its advisable not to do

  i dont need to make any comments
 the style of that person miss
hanks cried the colonel with a con-
temptuous flourish of his hand im
sorry to have any disagreeable talk be-
fore you-but you better start in with
a good understanding of what youve
got to deal with the best way to show
a man up is tu let him do it himself
out of his own mouth you have just
noticed how he has sneered at a noble
body of men who were banded together
in the old days for the defense of their
native country

  was your militia in the civil war
asked miss hanks much impressed

  the purple knobs on the colonels
cheek bones deepened perceptibly in
color and he was not so assertive when
he answered

  well not hardly my dear young
lady you see we were all business
men-prominent men and we felt that
we could do more for our native land
by staying at home and attending to
business this pageant will be like a
regimental reunion he hastened to
state trying to change the topic we
have been thinking of having one

  if what i have heard about that
regiment is true remarked the capn
i should think it would bring up old
memories better if you hold the re-
union over in canada thats where
you all skedaddled to when the war
broke out

  even the presence of miss hanks
might not have restrained colonel ward
at that moment he did explode one
terrific oath that startled her then
hiram look came into the office-and
when hiram look entered a room in a
hurry and in good spirits he had the
power to break up any sort of situa-
warming ovbr the milish



tion very effectively his plug hat was
on the back of his head and his coat
tails flaunted breezily

  well folks what are your plans for
gingering up the show he demanded
you want to remember that the
scheme is to get the folks into town
and get em to spend money the busi-
ness men need the cash the board-of-
trade boys are willing to chip and im
talking for em now but youve got
to have something besides a matched
game of jackstraws and a potato race
ginger it up-ginger it up in these
days the boys with coin dont spend it
in coming into town to see a hayrack
full of high-school girls in white dresses
and blue sashes riding along the street
and singing the star-spangled ban-
ner 

  general interest seems to be start-
ing said the capn to miss hanks
this is hiram look esquire i was
speaking to you about him

   in that reference to girls with sashes
miss hanks seemed to find slighting
reference to some of her promulgated
plans

  you must understand mr look
she said that a considerable part of a
pageant as best usage directs nowadays
consists of floats historical and other-
wise each one of the ladies societies
is to furnish a float

  thats all right but that aint
ginger what have you got for ginger 
ive been in the show business most of
my life i know what the people want
im no sort of a hand to put myself for-
ward miss hanks but i cant help feel-
ing an interest in a show proposition t
dont see why they didnt put me onto
the committee my friend sproul here
is a dead one on knowing what the peo-
ple want

  capn sproul was never backward in
displaying proper resentment that re-
mark touched him

  the town of scotaze as represented
by the decent folks in this place said
he remembered the show you did man-
age when you had every hootchie-
cootchie girl and shell-game operator
this side of hackenney operating here
on the streets when it comes to giving

a show you aint got any more moral
nature in you than a patagonian devol-
vulus has got-and the one i see down
there had et all his family except his
grandmother-and she was too tough
i think its perfectly terrible the
way you prominent citizens quarrel and
talk about each other declared miss
hanks tears in her blue eyes if you
keep on this way youll spoil the whole
pageant you ought to sink your per-
sonal feelings for the good of the cause
now capn sproul i think you ought
to join hands heartily with colonel
ward on what he proposes

  but the capn turned his back again
and resumed his gloomy survey of the
outer world

  if the colonel is proposing anything
with ginger in it you can count me in
volunteered hiram look with enthusi-
asm when progress hits the grade
you never find me sitting on behind and
dragging my feet

  miss hanks drew his attention to the
garments on the chair and eagerly ex-
plained colonel wards offer the colo-
nel added a word or two of his own
showman look examined the uniform
and then stood back and fingered his
nose plainly dubious his enthusiasm
dampened

  i aint saying anything against your
good intentions colonel ward and you
mustnt reckon me into the class of
knocker with my friend sproul over
there i know how to be a gent under
all circumstances but i cant see
where a lot of old methusalems dod-
dering down the main street with them
uniforms on is going to give the show
any ginger

  you dont expect men of our age to
turn cartwheels or play leapfrog do
you  demanded the colonel hotly
you seem to be missing the whole
spirit of the occasion

  no sir i know spirit when i see
it and i cant see any spirit in this
thing so far you aint to blame be-
cause youre old-but blast it all you
are old and you cant march for green
apples them that dont walk with
crutches will be treading on the loose
ends of their whiskers every other step


smiths magazine

 you go ahead and run your show and ill run my own

now colonel its no use for you to get
hot over this thing im talking about
a show that will draw money into this
town-and its no time for hair-oil
talk

  once again was an awkward situation
relieved by the entrance of a new ar-
rival it was batson reeves the lately
elected foreman of the scotaze ancient
and honorable firemens association
capn sproul took one look at reeves
over his shoulder and continued to
study the june landscape association
with reeves on the board of selectmen
had supplied the capn with a vigorous
crop of dislike for that gentleman

   have called around to see what

place you want the ancients to fill in
the pageant explained mr reeves
when anything comes off in town
were usually reckoned in as pretty im-
portant

  what has been the usual custom
asked miss iianks humbly im a
stranger here and i really want to suit
folks

  you see were the oldest tire com-
pany in the state marm said the fore-
man with much pride hecly our
tub is one hundred and twelve years
old we carry leather buckets puck-
ering-string drilling bags and bed-
wrenches just as they did in revolu-
tionary times
warming over the milish



  that is so picturesque cooed miss
hanks

  i aint going back on the ancients-
i used to be foreman myself said
hiram look ive always stood by
em it used to cost me morell two
hundred dollars a year giving em free
feeds but the ancients have marched
in every parade weve had here for a
hundred years-from a funeral to a
sunday-school picnic-until everybody
knows just how many cracks there are
in the side of that old tub we need
something new-something with ginger
in it he snapped his fingers impa-
tiently

  i dont know what you mean by
ginger stated reeves sullenly but if
the ancients aint recognized as usual
by being invited to parade and having
a free banquet by admiring citizens
then your show might as well be given
up wvll run it into the ground by
word of mouth

  for mercys sakes what sort of a
town have i dropped into cried miss
hanks twisting her hands and staring
from face to face capn sproul you
are the chairman of the general com-
mittee wrhy dont you do something
you started in by discouraging every
proposition i made

  well didnt i tell you the truth
inquired the capn facing around i
warned you that the principal danger
would be in having some men get too
much interested in what yon was trying
to do here are some of them-the
others are probably on the way

  it would be a grand success now
wouldnt it if somebody didnt drop
around and help out sneered hiram
look it is easy enough to stand and
growl about your betters sproul why
dont you grab in and help

  i declare i think mr look is right
affirmed miss hanks  dont under-
stand your attitude at all capn sproul
these gentlemen assemble here very
patriotically and offer their services
how on earth do you figure that any
harm is to come from accepting those
services i feel that i shall get quite
angry unless all this nonsense is
stopped

  ive been to sea most of my life
inarm stated capn sproul that
has given me an instinct for weather
signs  can smell trouble a long ways
ahead in figuring on weather you take
this sign and that sign and combine em
and get your prospects ive got the
same instinct  shore first youve
got to know your signs i know i lime
look and gid ward and bat reeves
and jared sparks and j want to warn
you that unless some almighty slick
steering is done you are going to head
into a social tornado that will lay your
proposition onto its beam ends  dont
propose to be bashful about talking right
out loud

  look here miss hanks shouted
mr look i dont propose to have you
scared by a man who got his manners
off the fiji islanders when he was
sailing in them parts you need men
in this scheme who will boost instead of
bump sproul hasnt been backward
about expressing his opinion of us let
me say to you about him that he never
had an original idea in his life if the
weather is bad a sailor is scared if
its good hes scared just the same
for lie thinks a fine day is a weather
breeder so a sailor is always hang-
ing back let him hang back lets
you and me go ahead

  now i propose to show you what
a man of original ideas can do with
poor material when he has a talent for
the show business them ancients is
an old story in a parade colonel ward
here and his methusalems trying to
march wouldnt make a hit you hold
on colonel ive got the floor now tts
time for open talk and i know what
im talking about lie held up his
hands and clacked fingers smartly into
the palms

  it takes talent i say to ginger up
poor material colonel you take your
men and call em the continental army
and get a bunch of hair and make your-
self up to look like general george
washington-and have the ancients
with their red shirts be cornwallis
army-bat here being old cornwallis
-and have cornwallis surrender to
you eh why its a cinch it will


smiths magazine

catch the crowd fifes and drums
a-playing old cornwallis surrendering
to you-and then girls to wave the star-
spangled banner-and a man and a
woman dressed as uncle sam and co-
lumbia to come up and shake hands
with you itll be a howl-for folks
like to have their patriotic feelings
stirred up ill have more details later
this is just first thought but you see
how quick talent-real talent in the
show business-grabs onto material

  im going to say to you that youre
a genius mr look declared miss
hanks with fervor youre a real
originator its the first big idea that
counts now that you have suggested
the thing i can think of a dozen little
touches of my own to add but i give
you all the credit for the main thought

i want you to work with me

  im always willing to help boost
said hiram and a wish from you
is a command on me he added gal-
lantly

  i like the idea myself stated colo-
nel ward ill ride on a white boss
itll be an honor to represent george
washington

  why man cried hiram your old
milish as you had planned for it was a
cold dish-cold for moren fifty years
and i propose to warm it over itll be
relished-i can tell you that therell
be ginger in it

  its positively an inspiration-thats
what it is was miss hanks encomium

  mebbe it is interposed mr reeves
digging his fingers into his grizzled
mane but it aint going to be no
proud moment for me representing that
old cuss of a cornwallis-and though i
havent sounded the ancients ill bet
itll be their sentiment that theyll want
a more popular part than being british
soldiers who have been licked out of
their boots theres a lot of spirit in
the ancients and its hard to crowd it
down

 you go to em and put up the
proposition and tell em that hiram
look will throw in a banquet for em
after its all over-a banquet that will
beat every other one he ever tendered
em cried the old showman thats

how much of a booster i am when i get
interested in a thing the ancients will
never go back on me

  its going to make a lot of differ-
ence in their feelings-having the ban-
quet admitted reeves and i wont
stand in the way of the boys getting a
good feed even if i have to represent
old cornwallis but i can tell you its
going to rankle

  its all a part of the show-and ive
been in the show business long enough
to understand insisted hiram folks
dont lay anything up against a villain
in the show if he takes his part well
now lets all get busy

 he strode across the room and
slapped capn sproul  the shoulder

  come now aaron let up on your
sulking and your growling you cant
stop a good thing when it gets started
were going to make a show of this-a
show understand 

  there aint any doubt about it
agreed the capn

  well what do you propose to do
go home snug all upper canvas
hang out oil bags rig a sea anchor and
make ready to ride it out

  i dont understand your sailor
lingo

  im going to get out of this thing
and stay out of it roared capn sproul
all hands even down to myself are
agreed that it was a mistake ramming
me into it you have picked your help-
ers miss hanks and youre going to
get a lot of help you dont need me
i seem to be complicating things by
staying around so good day

  miss hanks pouted and allowed him
to go without protest he did appear
to be a reactionary and surly old sea
dog who was not assisting her to any
noticeable extent the capn when he
slammed the door behind him heard
fliram fortifying her faith in her new
corps of coadjutors

  during the next few days various la-
dies belonging to the local societies
made efforts to coax the capn back into
the activities of the pageant but he was
not to be moved by entreaties then
they let him severely alone and the re-
proachful louada murilla his wife
warming over the milish



brought word to him that he did not
seem to have a friend left in town but
capn sproul refused to offer any com-
ments on the situation june was his
busy time with his garden sass and
he kept away from the village

  it was borne to his ears however
that miss hanks seemed to have lost
rj-ol of her volunteer helpers she
nad announced the plans of her
pageant of progress early in her
campaign and it was the artistic dig-
nity of the scheme that had attracted
the interest of the women of the town
every girl in scotaze had been drafted
for the emblematic floats and the pro-
posed tableaux in the village square
every schoolboy had signed a pledge to
refrain from firecrackers and was being
trained to take part in the big show
miss hanks advertising made much of
this phase of the pageant and her bills
had little to say of the proposed demon-
stration by the embattled veterans of
the town

  hiram look stormily demurred he
had confined his attention wholly to this
end of the show and piled up more
details in most voluminous manner

  its the big feature he informed
the fair promoter im making it so
i understand the show business its
the only thing that will have ginger in
it-real ginger you aint playing it
up big enough in the advertising

  but we mustnt let the tail wag the
dog insisted miss hanks your plan
is interesting as a feature but not espe-
cially important

  say look here thats casting a slur
on my ability as a showman ill bet
you five hundred dollars that my end
of it will be the only thing the crowd
will care a hoot about

  thereupon miss hanks was both
angry and shocked and made her feel-
ings plain to hiram look and also ex-
pressed her entire faith in the excellence
of her own ideas regarding spectacles
for the public

  hiram look was not a patient man
or a man to allow a rival to triumph
he had expressed his opinion in regard
to the relative values of the features of
the great day and now he set about
making himself a true prophet lie
covered all the dead walls for miles
about with flaming posters advertising


smiths magazine

the surrender of cornwallis be-
side these bills miss hanks modest an-
nouncements showed only as stars at
noonday when she took the volcanic
and impetuously active hiram to task
for his unmannerly tactics in putting
his own exploits ahead of her own the
split came in earnest

  i never did get along very well with
a woman who was trying to do a mans
job he tartly informed miss hanks
you go ahead and run your show and
ill run my own

  but there are not two shows sir i
came here and started this project its
my business getting up pageants your
scheme is only one feature in it you
must subordinate it

  no such thing blustered hiram
carried away by his enthusiasm as to
his private project ive got a reputa-
tion to keep up in this section as a
showman they are looking to me to
give em something lively i shall live
here after this is over and after you
go away i dont propose to have it
slurred that my part of the show was
the punk end no sir go ahead and
do the best you can but im the boy
thatll deliver the goods

  this is simply outrageous flamed
miss hanks i demand that you and
your crowd stay out of my way

  we shall declared hiram with
vigor you wont have any crowd i
want to say to you miss hanks that
when you coaxed me into this thing as a
helper you were getting somebody who
knows his business in the show line
and i cant stop now when ive once
got started and you cant expect me to
sacrifice my reputation by doing so
and after that run-in hiram look
attended strictly to his own show and
miss hanks tried to forget her misgiv-
ings and do the same thing

  capn aaron sproul did not hurry
down to the village on the morning of
the fourth he arrived in the square
moving leisurely rather late in the fore-
noon he glanced about him with some
astonishment there did not seem to be
any crowd visible clumps of people
were scattered about to be sure and
the emblematic floats were massed on

one of the side streets and were sur-
rounded by the young folks who were
to participate in the exercises but the
mass of holiday spectators was not in
evidence

  the capn strolled along and came
face to face with uncle jordan never-
failing fountain of information in
scotaze

  well i want to say to you you
being a prominent citizen capn sproul
that this is a devil of a note blurted
uncle jordan manifestly filled with dis-
gust

  must say that for all the advertis-
ing that has been done the town doesnt
seem to be drawing in much of a
crowd stated the capn serenely but
i aint a bit surprised jordan that the
folks have stayed away this thing
hasnt been run right from the start--
and  was in at the start and predicted
what would happen

  uncle jordan looked the capn up and
down and his disgust became mingled
with astonishment

  say look-a-here where have you
been keeping yourself that you dont
know any more about what has been
going on here to-day

  i have been staying close at home
fighting squash bugs and minding my
own business

  dont you know what that infernal
hiinc look is doing here-riding ram-
pant over the whole programmy

  i can give a general guess-having
predicted what would happen but i
havent heard any of the details con-
fessed the capn what has he done
-rid miss hanks out of town on a rail
and fed poisoned candy to the chil-
dren

  thats sarcastic-and i know it but
he has done almost as bad so far as the
success of this day goes for the good
name of this town whined uncle jor-
dan theres my daughter the school-
teacher over there with the little flock
she has set up nights to drill and train
and its past time for the parade-and
now there aint nobody here to see em
parade hime look has scooped all
the crowd i never saw such devilish
actions he has two brass bands
warming over the milish



every time since early morning any
crowd has got together here in the vil-
lage he has come in with a brass band
and marched up and down and has hol-
lered to everybody to come over into
the sands pasture where the big show
is and people are fools theyll fol-
low a band he has been in here moren
ten times with them bands one follers
him and the other stays and holds the
crowd miss hanks has gone over to
plead and beg-but she might just as
well talk to a howling cyclone blast
him here lie comes again hell stam-
pede the young ones next

 showman look marched ahead of
the blaring band bellowing hoarsely
through a megaphone behind the band
rode miss iioloelle hanks in a dec-
orated pony cart to judge by appear-
ances miss hanks had joined the op-
position show the band made a stormy
circuit of the village square and was
led away by the vociferous hiram hu-
man nature has its limitations one is
prone to follow the crowd in this world
most of the spectators who had re-
mained loyal to the real pageant gave
up the struggle with their inclinations
at this point and marched away behind
the band

  i aint a quitter confided uncle
jordan to the capn but i swow there
must be something considable going on
over in the sands pasture-theyre all
going over and nobodys coming back
he hurried away and joined the file-
closing stragglers

  it was borne in upon capn sproul
at that juncture that miss hanks was
in no way a part of the procession she
drove up to him the white reins trem-
bled with the trembling of her hands
tears could not drown the anger in her
eyes

  capn sproul i want to apologize to
you she cried you told me the truth
about those dreadful men youre the
only man in this town who seems to
have any good sense and honesty

  youre putting it strong but i aint
going to get into any dispute with a lady
-it wouldnt be polite marm returned
the capn

  i have been chasing after that howl-

ing lunatic and he wont even stop and
listen to me

  take hime look when he has got a
circus fit on him and he aint moren
half human i know all about him-
ive had plenty of experience with him
in them fits

  he has spoiled my pageant he lias
taken unfair means he has two bands
of music he is giving away cider and
gingerbread and its all just a low and
rowdy affair the way he is conducting
it and i do think a number of those
old men are intoxicated capn sproul
its disgraceful

  i could say a lot about hime look
marm but ill simply state that if he
was given the job to train a class of
boys for a sunday-school exhibition
hed bring em out onto the platform
with boxing gloves  their hands and
steel spurs on like fighting roosters
hed call that gingering up the show
the trouble with him is he has circused
it too much

  but havent you any influence with
him 

  youll have to excuse me if i dont
dip into it marm i dont want to be
considered as twitting you on whats
past and gone when i say that you
had your fair warning and didnt see
fit to use it the best i can say now to
comfort you is this i have seen hime
look operate before now in gingering
a thing up he most always jabs in so
much ginger tha the tiling gets to going
so fast it stubs its toe and tumbles
down as i have said before ive got a
sailormans instinct in smelling trouble
its coming over there in the sands
pasture pretty mighty sudden my best
advice to you is to set quiet and tight
and amuse the young ones in the shade
here and when the squall is over go
ahead and make the most of whats left
so ill bid you good lay and good luck
with a drag of his foot and a sailors
salute he took his departure miss
hanks sighed when she noted that he
too was headed in the direction of the
opposition show

  the capn trod somewhat cautiously
along the outskirts of the throng that
packed the sands pasture there was


smiths magazine

clamor in the air bands bombarded
the ear with lively tunes barkers were
hawking their wares and the multitude
swayed and twisted and pushed this
way and that the capn was promptly
informed that this ferment of the mass
was caused by the efforts to crowd up
to the cider barrels and the gingerbread
tables where all comers were served
free capn sproul allowed himself to
be sucked into the whirlpool of human-
ity he was not a man to dodge the
storm center of events

  finally he came in sight of hiram

washington and the part of the british
soldiers will be taken by the scotaze
ancient and honorable firemens as-
sociation who have consented to sink
their natural patriotic feelings for this
day and date only in order to make up
a british army hoping that nobody will
misunderstand their feelings about their
own country give them room good
peep-ul the band will now play the
star-spangled banner while the pre-
liminaries are being arranged

at that moment constable zeburee
nute came thrusting through the press

better get your show ready to start marm theyre having the last tableau in the other one

look the old showman had mounted
a barkers rostrum and began to shout
through his megaphone

 good peep-ul good peep-ul
list-un one and all the big show is
about to begin one of the greatest and
most instructive spectacles ever af-
forded on the american continent-an
event that will be talked about-the
grand representation of one of the big-
gest events in history-the surrender of
cornwallis to the brave and mighty
george washington to take place
here and now those brave and patri-
otic heroes the cuxabexis intrepid mili-
tia will take the part of the army of

his face was grave there was a worried
scowd on his forehead and he addressed
himself to the capn speaking in low
tones

  im looking for tophet to split loose
here capn sproul and i wish i wasnt
constable of this town

  i have wished that myself in them
days when i was selectman and had to
call on you for duty declared the un-
feeling capn what are you bringing
your troubles to me for

  ive got to talk to somebody who has
got common sense and aint full of
fight foolishness gingerbread and hard
cider ill say this-george washing-
warming over the milish



ton is all right and seems to feel some
sense of responsibility and aint dis-
gracing the high name but his army
is tea-ed up to a point where they aint
respectable cornwallis-i aint going
to mince my words in this crisis capn
sproul-is drunhern a boiled owl i
have pitched into him about it and he
said he had to go to work and dull his
sensibilities or he couldnt act out the
part it aint going to be no kind of a
show that will add credit to this town
them ancients are fullern goats-they
have been dulling their sensibilities too
theyve got to the point where they
dont know whether this is a tub squirt
or a barn-raising bee its all right for
itime look to be generous but he
ought to know that when some men are
around where stuff is free gratis for
nothing theyll make hogs of them-
selves

  ilime look dont know anything
when he is circusing retorted the
capn go and arrest him for inciting
a riot-thats what this thing will turn
into

  i dont dare to do it stammered
nute

  i knew you wouldnt dare to and
thats why i suggested it-my advice
wouldnt get me into the mess anyway
the capn displayed no more interest in
mutes forebodings lie crowded to the
front of the throng in time to see colo-
nel ward emerge from his tent arrayed
in regimentals wig and cocked hat

  lie took his stand in front of the scat-
tering line of his army-about twenty
ancient men in the uniform of the old
milish the band played yankee
doodle and the crowd howled
george washingtons army promptly
showed that it felt the thrill of life in
its venerable legs and the old men be-
gan to jig feebly in time with the mu-
sic with most unseemly antics from a
military standpoint their commander
squinted along the line of the red shirts
of the ancients he did not find the re-
doubtable and defeated commander of
the british there was a stage wait
and then the missing general came
teetering around the end of the line

  pipe off corned-wallis suggested

one of the local humorists a remark
that was greeted by the crowd with
great hilarity

  but mr reeves was serious even to
the point of rancor

  he took his stand in front of his men
and scowded across the narrow dividing
space at general washington there
was another stage wait

  go ahead and make your speech
cornwallis get busy the people are
waiting prompted general manager
look from the side lines get to it
surrender

  ive deshidtd t ancients can lick
any body of men in this county stated
foreman reeves in thick tones

  thats got nothing to do with this
show yelled hiram stepping out of
the line of spectators youre the brit-
ish army

  i say twas a mishtake t take a noble
body of men like ancient and honub-
bubbles and call em briish army in-
sisted foreman reeves i rise t point
of order i refuse t be called briish
army well lick any man t calls us
briish army

  look here cornwallis you go ahead
and surrender commanded the infuri-
ated hiram

  ive deshided not t surrender
whats good surrendering when i aint
licked  i didnt want to be that cussed
old cornwallis t start with ancients
can lick anybody and ought to be amer-
ican army

  by that time general washington
was in an impatient mood he strad-
dled across to cornwallis and shook
a lean finger under the british nose

give up your sword sir i demand
it in the name of the land of the free
id like to shee you get it yelped
reeves lay your old paw on it and
ill cuff your chops

  iliram look came stamping down the
line and passed close to the capn

  in warming over your milish i
reckon you got a little mite too much
ginger in the water suggested capn
sproul meeting hirams flaming glance
with eyes that twinkled mebbe youd
better give reeves ether and extract
that sword


smiths magazine

  hiram did not pause to discuss the
matter with the satirist he ran to
cornwallis grabbed him by the shoul-
ders and shook him to and fro as if
he were trying to rattle a little common
sense back into him

  ill trip him and you take his sword
away from him the panting hiram
suggested to general washington after
a few minutes cornwallis had sud-
denly begun to put up a very respecta-
ble resistance he was trying to get
his sword out of the scabbard and was
kicking about in dangerous fashion

  the ancients rushed forward to the
scene of the struggle

  just hold on a minute squire look
warned one of them when a man is
our foreman we stand behind him
there cant no dirt be done to him he
aint no cornwallis right now-hes
foreman reeves and you take your
hands offm him

  capn aaron sproul at that moment
pushed his way back into the crowd
forced his bulk valiantly through it and
started back toward the village

  ive seen too many fights to take any

further interest in em he remarked
to himself  hate to get squat in a
jamming crowd and have my feet
stepped on furthermore ive got a
little word to take to miss hanks

  he did not turn his head when the
uproar behind him grew louder

  how long it lasts will depend on
how many friends each side has got in
the crowd he mused but i reckon it
wont amount to much theyll fall
down making motions at each other
here is the message capn aaron
sproul delivered to miss hanks whom
he found sitting disconsolately in her
pony cart better get your show ready
to start marm theyre having the last
tableau in the other one the crowd
will relish your show more than ever
now so cheer up its coming out all
right theyll need a lot of your show
so as to take the taste of ilime looks
show out of their mouths

  and the vanguard of a disgusted
crowd promptly verified capn sprouls
declaration-and miss hanks smiled
and in due time led forth her panoramic
pageant of progress

a girl at a ball

                      a drift upon the musics tide

the dancers float along

                       high in the flower-twined gallery
                       the viols thrilling song

                       the harps thick golden voice go on

                        youre smiling with the throng

                      but slender one o tender one

                    i watched you-was it wrong

                       i saw a look you could not hide

                     and-though you knew it not-you sighed

                     the world would have you wed that youth
                     who stands so near but child

                      your straying look goes not to him

                     eager and almost wild
                     your young eyes quest about for one
                     whom spite of womans art

                      a love more sweet a love complete

                       thrones in your inmost heart

                        i may not speak but time will test

                         think i feel you love me best

a little talk oh a few of the books
of the day
by edward everett male jr

in writing of the books of the day
we shall make no attempt at a
broad survey or in effect a history
of literature at the present time we
shall take a much more humble per-
haps but certainly a more useful task
and try merely to point out each month
a few books that people will like to
read and as people are most apt to
read novels we shall begin at least with
half a dozen of what seem the most
entertaining of the novels of the last
few months

  we shall not pretend that they are
the best we shall not endeavor to
analyze them and weigh their excel-
lence  we shall not affect to be poster-
ity sitting in judgment we shall sim-
ply talk of them as any one might tell
of any hook that had seemed amusing
or entertaining

  then because people generally like
to have in hand something beside a
novel we shall each month speak of
some more serious books and here
we shall try to be appropriate to the
season so that our readers may always
find something suited to the spirit of
the hour

the lee shore

  such a name as this perhaps will
make one think of sailors or smugglers
or wreckers or some good ship being
driven upon the rocks but this book
by rose macaulay g h doran 


co is not a sailors story it is a
very beautiful story about a very beau-
tiful character it tells us how peter
margerison after he had taken a pilot
and made a good start in life found
himself drifting to leeward

  peter was one of the most engaging
young fellows in the world and not
only made many friends who were
eager to help him but was not unable
to help himself but he was also not
unwilling to take some interest in the
condition of others and some responsi-
bility for their misdoings especially of
those of his brother hilary and his
good-hearted wife peggy so things
were perpetually harder and harder to
make head against

  but the real thing in the book is not
peters character or the misfortunes
of his brother it is shown by the
motto which reads the division the
division of those who have and those
who have not runs so deep ps almost to
run to the bottom peter was really
one of the have nots so was his
cousin lucv who expressed his posi-
tion and hers when she said  im in
the under lot with you and father and
all the poorer people who dont get
things and have to find life nice in spite
of it

  but somehow peter got mixed up
with the other set with those who had
things or at least behaved as if they
had things and it was the unconscious


smiths magazine

effort to stay with such people that was
more and more a failure and that set
him more and more on a lee shore

  it is a very charming story of eng-
land and italy partly of artistic life
partly of a nondescript life of penury
but always full of interesting people

ti-ie poor ltttle rich girl

  almost any one will confess to a
first prejudice against the poor lit-
tle rich girl by eleanor gates
duffield  co when he hears what
it is about because it will appear to
be merely an imitation of alice in
wonderland and that does not seem
at all the thing the poor little rich
girl however is much more than that
in fact the first half of it is not an
imitation of anything it is a study of
the life of a little rich girl one of those
prisoners of wealth who are always so
surrounded by the circumstances of
riches that they can never be them-
selves

  poor little gwendolyn is always in
a world that presses upon her a world
of familiar faces and familiar circum-
stances it is true but also of many
strange conceptions her father for
instance is said to be made of money
to be always in harness to be burn-
ing the candle at both ends she
hears some visitors say that her mother
has the social bee in her bonnet has
bought a pig in a poke that she
makes the money fly a little
bird has told some one all this every-
where are strange things in the street
is a man who makes faces some-
where in the house is a snake in the
grass such a one split her sides with
laughing another had a flea in her
ear

  there are some very curious things
in gwendolyns world and among the
least comprehensible are father and
mother they love her but they so
rarely see her

  well in time comes the solution of
all these problems she finds herself
with the man who makes faces and
one by one those strange things of
which she has heard are made clear

her dear father puts off his harness
and gives up burning the candle at both
ends her mother gets rid of the bee in
her bonnet and gets the pig out of the
poke the snake in the grass is there
and gwendolyn sees that it is the hypo-
critical governess her own maid jane
who has got very fat splits her sides
with laughing so at last everything is
made clear

  and then of course gwendolyn finds
herself in her little bed with her dear
father and her lovely young mother on
either side of her anxiously waiting
for her to come back to herself and
them it appears that she has been
sick so it turns out well the wise
doctor prescribes the country and
johnny blake father and mother
forget their business and their social
ambitions and meet each other once
more over the sick bed of their darling
all ends happily

the armchair at the inn

  we could find no better name for a
book by mr f llopkinson smith it
suggests just the things we expect to
find in one of his books-namely good
things to eat and drink and good stories
and talk of these twto matters per-
haps the former bulks more largely in
ones remembrance although it certain-
ly does not in the books themselves no
author but charles dickens is so asso-
ciated with good cheer but charles
dickens usually stays at home in the
heavier old english hospitality of
rounds of beef and dozens of oysters
flanked with pots of porter and glasses
of spirits-and-water air hopkinson
smiths imagination on the other hand
is more of a bon vivant and more eclec-
tic in that he knows the good things to
eat and drink of the whole world

 in the armchair at the inn
charles scribners sons he has
broken away from the terrapin and can-
vasback of our own shores and estab-
lished himself in a charming old world
inn in normandy the very place if not
to live in at least to spend a few days
or weeks in during the afternoon of
life
olcr bookshelf

 

  here at the inn are a party of old
friends a painter a sculptor an engi-
neer and one or two others with a
charming woman who happens in now
and then and their after-dinner talk
makes up the book for there is little
action save a love story that goes quiet-
ly on one and another tells his story
gives an experience or expresses his
opinion tells of a girl who lived
among the dyaks and got tattooed or
of an englishman who became an afri-
can slave trader with a bunch of thirty
oil-rubbed wives or of a man who took
a statue of a madonna in an italian
church

  entertaining talk it is mostly with
enough connection and development of
idea to hold it together and carry the
reader along if not with the fervid in-
terest of a detective story at least with
the pleasant charm of after-dinner talk
which after all is just what it is

the crock of gold

  as for the crock of gold by
james stephen macmillan i suspect
that any one who reads it for the story
will become impatient for there can-
not be said to be any story in the sense
of a definite plot there are plenty of
people and plenty of things happen to
them thus there is a philosopher who
sets off on his travels to find the god
angus og and first meets a big come-
ly woman with whom he shares his
breakfast and in fact gives her a kiss
in the eye then meets a very old wom-
an with stones in her shoes and finally
two men and a woman in doubt which
to marry who would have married the
philosopher but for his going away in
the night

  so there are things enough happen-
ing to the people and people enough
for them to happen to for there are
two philosophers and their wives and
their children seumas and brigid-for
it is an irish story-and meehawl mac-
murrachu and his daughter caitilin
who minded the goats till the day she
met the great god pan and followed
him when he called her and the great
god angus og and shawn the police-

man and in fact so many people it
would be tedious to name them

  and indeed it is not the people or
what happens to them that makes up
the book so much as it is the general
wisdom of life that is poured out 
every page whether like basketsful of
pearls in the speeches of the philos-
ophers or one by one in what is said
by the children or by caitilin or in-
deed not said by anybody but just
apparent in the story

  it is an amusing book if you get over
being vexed at finding not much of a
story and are willing to browse about
in a leisurely way taking what there
is instead of grumbling at what there
is not then you may have snatches of
irish peasant life celtic lore touches of
nature a bit of a fairy tale common
sense or wisdom or epigram from the
philosophers allegory from the author
something of old greek myth-in fact
so much of a choice that you would be
very hard to please if you didnt find
something to like and very catholic in
taste if you liked it all but that of
course isnt necessary

the happy warrior

  mr hutchinsons the happy war-
rior little brown  co has met
with the greatest appreciation in eng-
land which is not surprising but it
promises to be exceedingly well re-
ceived here as well the story deals
with the law of primogeniture and the
sudden changes which may be wrought
in some obscure family on the failure
of a direct heir in the principal branch

  a new loid and lady burdon and
rollo the baby heir duly take posses-
sion of burdon old manor and all that
belongs to it put the succession is
only apparently correct as the lord
burdon killed on the indian frontier
really left behind him a young wife
soon to be a mother and around this
unknown fact with all its proofs in
order turns the story of the happy
warrior

  cruelly repulsed by the lady burdon
in possession audrey barely reaches
her lodging where she dies in silence


smiths magazine

leaving her son to the care of her sister
margaret who prepares a vengeance
which must wait for the apparent heir
when the two hoys come of age but
she delays too long justice keeps well
but time has strange fortunes for
vengeance the boys grow up to love
each other and the vengeance takes a
strange turn

  most of the minor characters are ex-
cellent there is the stout mr hanna-
ford who supplies horses for the cir-
cus a great friend of percival redpath
the ousted heir a gay-hearted honest
loving little fellow who delights in his
lunches with the good man the chick-
ing dinners as he calls them there
is a little whiff of dickens at his best
and also of little lord fauntleroy
in the story of the dinners and the ride
on the little horse after them but it is
only a little whiff and a pleasant one

  there is also japhra the somewhat
idealized and philosophic gypsy the
friend of percivals boyhood and the
wise counselor of his youth with his
sweet silent daughter ima and even
poor egbert hunt with his hatred of
tyrangs and bloodsuckers they
are all human and possible and alive

  we have also a short but most ex-
quisite love scene almost as beautiful
as the one in richard feverel also
some boxing matches and one great
fight with bare knuckles to which only
an expert could do justice but we have
the testimony of the london times
that it is magnificent

  the book has an atmosphere of sanity
and elevation about it it gives more
than temporary pleasure and it has the
prime qualities of interest and beauty

corporal cameron

  tt is not necessary to speak of any-
thing so well known as mr ralph con-
nors deep interest in the canadian
west and of his ardent admiration of
the northwest mounted police of
whom he tells us the astonishing fact
that five hundred of these trained men
have kept in order over ten thousand
indians

  in his last book corporal cameron

g h doran  co we find with
pleasure some of his old favorites
the fine old presbyterian missionary to
the indians the splendid athlete as a
hero the pretty sensible girls and his
own deep and sincere religious faith
breathed through the whole story

  his hero gets into undeserved trouble
in edinburgh after a course of dissipa-
tion which nearly brings him to ruin so
that he tries his fortune in the new
world the dominion of canada

  book two finds him in montreal
with a good letter to an influential
banker one wonders whether cam-
eron is a fair specimen of a young
scotchman who at home has been a fine
athlete and is now placed in unusual
circumstances his ignorance and
helplessness are we hope unusual and
if he were not an extremely nice fel-
low with great muscular power and
unerring knowledge of just where to hit
his opponent we fear he would have to
abdicate his position as hero

  however he valiantly tries farming
and on the farm he finds a delightful
little boy who adores him and mandy
a rough awkward girl of seventeen
with beautiful eyes who adores him
too there are good things in this
part a capital sermon on the parable
of the ten talents and an exciting ac-
count of the merrymaking on dominion
day

  but cameron leaves the farm and in
book three we find him attached to the
survey near row river under one
maclvor from this time the interest
of the story increases and the adven-
ture of the blizzard and the whisky
runners and the murder of the two
stonies are very thrilling and the ex-
citement is well kept up to the moment
when cameron finds a congenial posi-
tion in the mounted police first as con-
stable and then as corporal

  if mr connor intended to point a
moral in this tale it probably was that
it is a bad thing that a man should be
taught nothing about the art of living
and succeeding in this very strenuous
world and how much help he would get
from a little training before he went
into a new world to make his fortune

a rook about flowers

  now that flowers are everywhere
one has need of a flower book in fact
two months ago if one were keen about
it there was need of a book except that
the keen ones very soon get so that they
do without a book except for reference
but now that there are so many flow-
ers all around one it is harder to find
out just what they are than it was when
there were but a few and when one
gets started with a book now well on
toward midsummer one finds how
many of the most beautiful flowers
have gone by

  the very first flowers of spring are
apt to be the most delicate and ex-
quisite the flowers of the woods while
toward midsummer come the more bril-
liant and at the same time the coarser
flowers of the roadside and the mead-
ow but with all of them arises the
question of the book

  the first use of a book is to tell us
the flowers name many people say
what is the use of just knowing the
name of a flower the real thing is
to know its look its beauty its habit of
growth its manner of life and if you
know these the name is a minor matter
while if you dont know them the name
amounts to little people just looking
for names they say are like indians
hunting for scalps they make lists
of the names that they know and are
far more concerned with the names
than with the flowers themselves with
their fresh and intimate beauty

  all this has a good deal of truth to
it but even allowing everything it is
necessary somehow to know the names
to which it may be added that the little
work needed in looking up the name
opens ones eyes to many things about
a flower that one would not otherwise
notice so granting that we want a
book the question is what book out
of so many 

  there are really only two kinds of
flower books-the scientific and the
popular and one can easily decide be-
tween them the important difference
is not that the popular book has attrac-
tive pictures of the flowers and pleasant

gossip about them while the scientific
book has only dry statements of fact
with cuts of ovaries and so forth the
real difference lies in the arrangement
the popular book is arranged accord-
ing to things that everybody will notice
like color the scientific book is ar-
ranged according to things that are
more essential but not so obvious like
the number of cells in the ovaries

  it is not a question of exactness or
correctness both should be exact and
correct it is a question of what kind
of arrangement is best for you and
for the beginner the popular arrange-
ments are undoubtedly better they
are in general two-one according to
color and then according to season
according to this double arrangement
it is generally easy to find the flower
at first then the popular book is
easier it is just what one wants but
after a while one wants something more
particular and then one will turn to the
scientific books

  there are many reliable books of
each kind grays manual is prob-
ably the best known of the scientific
books and mrs danas how to know
the wild flowers is one of the best-
known popular books there is no
noteworthy flower book announced for
this season so we will close with a men-
tion of one that appeared some years
since but has lately come more into no-
tice this is j w henshaws moun-
tain wild flowers of america leroy
phillips boston a book which calls
attention to one of the most delightful
forms of flower finding the looking for
mountain flowers especially for those
that grow above the tree line

 miss henshaw uses the word
mountain liberally so that we shall
also find here many of the flowers of
the lower hills as well as those that
grow in those wonderful places among
the rocks upon the lofty summits it is
a popular book not unlike mrs
danas in plan

  we should make one criticism on its
saying nothing as to the flowers habitat
of course it you have found a flower
you know one place at least where it
grows still it is good to know where


smiths magazine

else it may be found and if one is plan-
ning a trip one wants to know what
flowers one may expect to find other-
wise the book will be delightful to all
who love to get a little above the world
and find there those charming little
things that seem to have gained a
greater beauty from their isolation

the weaker vessel

  the weaker vessel is one of the
best of e f bensons novels it is a
story practically of the development of
character of the two chief people the
question of the book might be which
is the weaker vessel wife or husband
at first it seems that it must be
eleanor an impressive half-regulated
creature accustomed to the routine of
a semiclerical existence but hating it
all and longing for some other forms
of life occasionally breaking out by
playing a waltz during organ practice in
church and in other such ways

  then there is her husband who is a
smart brilliant self-confident sort of
person and it turns out that he can
write plays late at night he writes
them as a rule and as he writes he
smokes and sips away at whisky and
water he seems to need some stimu-
lant to do his best it is as if some
other self possessed him at times and
made him write the real stuff at other
times what he writes is miserable
weak mushy and with no sort of snap
one morning when he has worked late
his wife makes a discovery she finds
him lying  his bed in a drunken
stupor it becomes plain that he is be-
coming just a drunkard so it goes on
and we shall not tell the outcome save
to mention that eleanor is a very beau-
tiful and lovable person indeed

  it is a very charming story it is not
set in the great world that is so often
the scene of bensons novels it goes
on in the theatrical world so far as
there is any world except the home of
these two

  he is a dramatist and his wife
proves to have dramatic power and be-
comes an actress then there is a wom-
an who becomes his mistress who is

an actress too and the fourth is an
actor-manager it will not do to leave
out her father and mother though they
have little to do with the story

the wind before the dawn

  the wind before the dawn by
dell h munger doublcday page 
co is the story of a womans freeing
herself from the servitude into which
she had fallen in marriage and making
for herself a sensible freedom in which
she and her husband may both have
their rights and neither be forced to
insubordinate silence

  it took her a long time to manage
this and the book takes almost as long
she had ample warning for she saw
how her father and mother lived and
not only observed but studied the rela-
tion between them her mother was so
utterly cowed and crushed that she
scarcely imagined that there could be
any other way to live than that in which
she lived but elizabeth had more
imagination she saw  reason why
there should not be another way not a
sort of seesaw in which each one got
the better of the other by turns but
some kind of pulling together in which
they managed to get the strength of
both right on the thing to be done

  after she was married however she
found her ideal somehow slipping away
from her as one by one she submitted
to her husbands desires without mak-
ing them her own and finally it did
slip away from her and she saw noth-
ing of it for a long long time

  as to how it reappeared and what it
was like when it came we must leave
all that to the reader the book is a bit
long and dusty as one might say and
monotonous but that is  more than
saying that life out on the kansas
prairies is dusty and drab and so must
the book be that pictures such a life

  but the book comes to its appointed
end and that is like life too in fact
it is all very lifelike not only the
scenes and incidents but the people
elizabeth and aunt susan and sadie
and elizabeths mother the men per-
haps are a thought less natural but not
enough to count
  by allara udegralf

illustrated by g  vv hartis

it was on a memorable afternoon in
the sixth september of his life
while he walked homeward with the
six or eight other primary-grade boys
who lived in the west end that her-
bert rockwell became acquainted with
his great disability said harry platt
swinging his slate at the end of a long
strap my father is a butcher and if
it wasnt for him none of you could get
any meat to eat

  three days of school had been
enough to establish harry as the auto-
crat of the group his boast suggested
that the others show up to odious com-
parison their achievements in the way
of fathers

  my fathers peel the grocer and
lie has bushels of things in his store
aw a grocer aint nothin said
young platt

  my fathers got an office on com-
merce street

  that aint even as much as a gro-
cer decreed platt

  my fathers a conductor-and he
rides on the train every day  guess
thats nearly as good as a butcher any-
way 

  the group paused to sec how their
leader would get around this terrible
truth for a moment his clenched fists
threatened violence then he sniffed and
marched on ignoring the conductors
son he diplomatically turned the atten-
tion of the group toward another boy
whos your father herbert

  i dunno said the boy

  you dunno flow do you mean
i guess i haint got any said her-
bert rockwell watching the dust that
spudged up between his bare toes

  this astounding state of affairs ef-

fectively disposed of the embarrassment
caused by the conductors son every
other boy in the group had a father
therefore the only right and honorable
thing was to have a father therefore
herbert rockwells condition of father-
lessness was a sin and a shame so
their subconscious reasoning if it fol-
lowed the solid channel of precedent
must have run

  gee he haint got no father
commented harry platt more in pain
than in anger wha do you think o
that huh

  he haint got  father repeated
the others in varying keys of pain
astonishment and contempt

  yah you haint got  father
young platts voice arose in wrath
driving home the attack yah no
father

  yah echoed the others no
father shame yah yah

  the victim of their perfectly natural
cruelty plodded along with a coun-
tenance as gray and sodden as the dust
he shuffled through his chubby face
his big brown doglike eyes confessed
his misery and guilt and a sort of des-
olate wonder that he should be so de-
praved the very stockiness of his fig-
ure the very roundness of his cheeks
made his grief seem more poignant

  you dont know everything he
protested feebly as their condemnation
threatened to be converted into blows
maybe ive got one maybe im just
fooling you

  his voice and manner convicted him
only too plainly of disbelief in his own
innocence the others gathered around
him they yah-ed their contempt into
his ears they pushed him about and

      ter--w haivt t cn

well wha do you think o that he asked the boy

made faces at him they threatened him
with fists tongues and feet finally
they went on together leaving him to
follow alone he had been judged con-
victed and sentenced as summarily as
if he had committed a murder

  but agonized as he was his suffer-
ings childs way were as brief as they
were bitter even while he wiped away
a few tears on the sleeve of his blue-

checked shirt the peculiar wail of ma-
chine-sawn timber reached his ears his
eyes gladdened at the sound and his
gray cheeks regained some of their
usual color the long-drawn humming
shriek announced that he was approach-
ing the west end ax-handle factory
that heaven of interests for small boys
and the thought of it was as the waters
of lethe to his shame-burdened soul
the hanoicav



  he hurried along around a bend of
the road where overhanging trees made
the dust cool and velvety to his feet
and came in sight of the clearing that
surrounded the factory the engineer
was in the act of motioning the other
boys on their way as with most other
heavens the appreciation of the ax-
handle factory by its devotees was
largely imaginative the group went
reluctantly away and herbert sniffling
a little because of the memories the
sight of them aroused slowly ap-
proached the place they had left

  at the front door of the long low
narrow building which pulsed and vi-
brated like the home of an indignant
chained dragon sat the engineer the
boy stared at him  next to the heroes in
the mythology he admired that en-
gineer for the engineer fed and con-
trolled the flaming-mawed beast whose
rumblings filled the air and shook the
ground slowly he went till he stopped
altogether by the open door

  the blur of a great flywheel was vis-
ible over the shoulder of the engineer
and the single flaming eye of the black
engine beast glared dully in the gloom
the hoy lingered some yards away hop-
ing to see the beast fed his big eyes
wide and staring with attention com-
bined with the tear marks  his cheeks
to make him look much more lugubri-
ous than he really felt

  whats the matter son asked the
engineer

  as was natural before the utterance
of so great a man herbert was stricken
dumb he stared unblinkingly at the
engineers lean blue-overalled figure
at his furrowed face cut across by a
little sandy mustache lit by two bright
blue eyes at his long-billed cap which
was pushed back like the helmet of
athene in the mythology

  whats the matter repeated the
engineer smiling very comfortably
d they give you the go-by lie
jerked his thumb in the direction the
group had taken

  yes-sir said herbert he had
been told to say sir to the minister
but it seemed even more applicable to
the engineer

  come over here the engineers
voice was most friendly and consol-
atory want to look in while i fire
up 

  he wished to so much that he could
barely gulp out his thanks the en-
gineer made him sit down on the beam
that formed the sill of the doorway and
then went inside and opened up the
dragons mouth a terrific red glare
filled the gloom of the engine room
breathed from the dazzling fiery maw
of the beast into the midst of the maw
flew a shovelful of sawdust and shav-
ings  the dragon responded by shoot-
ing out a sheet of flame nearly a yard
long like a great red writhing tongue
the boy hugged his knees and gasped
in an ecstasy of fear and admiration
another shovelful brought another wild
exhibition of appetite from the dragon
but the second was not so fierce as the
first and with succeeding shovelfuls the
great tongue ceased to leap forth
finally the beast seemed satisfied the
engineer closed its mouth and came
panting into the open air

  well wha do you think o that
he asked of the boy

  arent you afraid

  afraid the engineer laughed in
a way that showed he was perfectly
calm but now i guess youd better
run along or your mall be worrying
about you

  the boy rose reluctantly the light
of a great awe and admiration on his
face i think youre the bravest man
that ever lived he declared i think
youre as brave as-as the lion-hearted
achilles and i wish you were my
father

  for a moment the engineer was quite
overcome then his face muscles
twitched into the beginning of a smile
but he could not smile into the boys
religiously worshipful eyes

  i reckon its up to me to say i think
youve got awful good taste he re-
marked at last whose boy are you
anyway 

  im sarah rockwells

  the engineers face showed some
comprehension lives down there be-
side the main line


smiths magazine

    yes 

  well she must take a power of
comfort out of you anyway and now
you better run along home to her

  with many backward glances he
went on his way when the factory
was hidden by trees and the west end
crossroads opened before him he
quickened his steps afraid lest harry
platt or the son of peel the grocer
might be waiting before their fathers
shops to fling insults or even stones at
him as he passed they did not appear
and with great thankfulness he turned
down the little blind alleyway that led
to the railway tracks

  the rockwell home lay in a v-shaped
bit of land bounded by a twenty-foot
hedge on the town side by the main
line of the st louis railway and by
the backs of several stores that fronted
on commerce street the two-room
cottage with a lean-to that served for
the kitchen had lacked paint for so long
that the weather had macle up by turn-
ing it a wonderful silver-gray climb-
ing honeysuckle and dorothy perkins
roses nearly covered it and a clump of
huge sunflowers concealed the dilap-
idated entrance herbert made his way
through a hole in the hedge stepping
carefully to avoid thorns and passed
through the trim little vegetable garden
to the door of the lean-to

  his mother was in the sitting room
as he had expected busy with the
plain sewing by which she earned a
living for herself and her son she
smiled at him over the piled-up mass of
goods in her lap and continued to look
at him while she bit off a thread her
wide blue eyes were vague and tender

  ive been expecting you for some
minutes sonny-boy she said in a
little id have gone down the road to
look for you you mustnt loiter it
makes mumsey nervous

  there was a peculiar lack of self-
consciousness in her round face with
its faint drooping lines around the cor-
ners of the eyes and mouth indeed her
look suggested that she hardly ever be-
came conscious of herself she seemed
one of those persons whom life uses
almost without their knowledge and

dowers with trust and contentment in
return for their blind obedience

  mumsey said the boy coming di-
rectly to the matter that troubled him
whos my father

  for a moment something like con-
sternation came over mrs rockwells
face she allowed her hands to fall
limply on her work

  whatever made you think of that
she asked

  the other fellers was telling who
was their fathers explained herbert
solemnly and they asked me and i
didnt know

  she took up her sewing again per-
haps id ought to have told you before
sonny your fathers in heaven she
said and closed her lips firmly as if she
had made a profession of faith

  in heaven repeated the boy

  yes god is merciful now dont
think anything more about it but run
out and cut your kindlings and bring
in your wood and motherll stir you
up some batter cakes for your supper
fie obeyed the injunction about the
wood and kindling but as to the other
matter his mind ran into a morass of
doubt and foreboding he was not even
thoroughly convinced that his father
was in heaven  the touch of doubt in his
mothers answer had not escaped him
besides being the son of a father in
heaven was not the same as being the
son of a butcher a grocer or a con-
ductor the shame of being different
was not lifted by his discovery he
shed a few tears over the matter be-
fore going to sleep and wondered why
he had ever been born

  then he magnificently dreamed that
he was the son of the engineer at the
ax-handle factory who let him throw
a handful of shavings into the mouth of
the dragon bitter was that awaken-
ing

  he went to school unusually early
the next morning to avoid the taunts of
the other boys and escaped at noon into
a near-by strip of wood where he could
eat his luncheon undisturbed but at
the four-oclock dismissal his place with
the rs near the end of the line
the handicap



brought him out into the group of no father bellowed harry the auto
platts peels elberons and johnsons crat as they turned off main street into
yah  theres the boy that haiirt got the west end road


smiths magazine

  his loneliness of the day prompted
him to make some defense instead of
fleeing before or dropping behind he
faced his accuser

  you think youre smart dont you
lie demanded  guess ive got as good
a father as you have

  fight fight chirped the son of
peel the grocer delighted with- the
prospects opened up by this sudden
show of rebellion

  yah who is he then demanded
young platt squaring shoulders for bat-
tle tell us who he is or ill knock
your block off

  his eminent danger was less potent
than his dream of the night before in
prompting the reply that sprang from
herberts lips

  my fathers the engineer at the ax-
handle factory he said so there

  the sheer audacity of the reply made
it for the moment effective harry
platts broad german face became quite
stolid with amazement and the other
boys taking their cue from their leader
forbore to break the awed silence that
followed herbert walked steadily
along looking neither to the right nor
to the left as if the matter were settled
and done with

  well-wha do you think o that
murmured harry after the group had
marched for perhaps a hundred yards
in perfect silence whynt you say so
before

  i wanted to sprise you lied her-
bert fluently his imagination gave him
an advantage over the matter-of-fact
butchers son he stepped proudly
along conscious of the awe his an-
cestry was evoking from the boys who
had so lately despised him his pleas-
ure was doubly sweet after his recent
pain his sudden prominence quite in-
toxicated him

  the engineer at the ax-handle fac-
tory has been my father ever so long
he volunteered almost ever since i
was born 

  the son of peel the grocer plucked
young platt by the sleeve

  dont blieve him he whispered
into his leaders ear hes makin it
all up

  harry the autocrat although plainly
astounded by this suggestion nodded as
if the thought had already occurred to
him the other boys whispered among
themselves only the fact that her-
bert was marching on ahead wrapped
up in a dream of his own greatness kept
him from realizing that a delicate mo-
ment had arrived in his affairs

  ask him whether his father lives at
his house  counseled young peel the
engineer lives at mrs briggs boarding
house-i know cause i follered him
home one night

  harry strode after herbert and took
him firmly by the arm

  does your father live at your
house he demanded

  even before this swift and unex-
pected attack the fabricator bore up
nobly he dont live with us he ex-
plained because our house aint grand
enough for him soon hes going to
build a big house for us on grant ave-
nue-then youll see 

  harry looked around for his coun-
selor in chief

   taint so declared young peel
shrilly hes makin it all up hes
a great big fibber

  herbert extended his fists as a sign
that he was ready to put the matter to
a trial by combat the son of peel the
grocer was near his size and the
chances seemed good for vindicating his
claims but ilarry platt restrained
him

  well just ast the engineer de-
cided the leader shrewdly and if

youve been foolin us- come on

fellers

  the trapped fabricator as soon as
he could overcome his consternation
argued that the engineer would not like
it that he might throw them all into
the mouth of the dragon that he wished
the matter to be kept secret until the
new house was finished but harry the
autocrat assisted by the cynical coun-
sels of young peel was not to be moved
with the liveliest misery and dejection
in every feature herbert was dragged
down the road toward the factory
only the natural optimism of childhood
the hope that something would certainly
the handicap



with pride he heard the engineer accept his mothers invitation to step up on the porch and sit a while

turn up to save him kept his legs from
giving way beneath him

  he made a frantic break for freedom
as they approached the clearing but
superior force recaptured and held him
fast then he stood in judgment before
the engineer

  what the-particular cats  gasped
the great man coming from feeding the
dragon to find the staring assembly
awaiting him here you-let go of
young rockwell you big bully

  harry rapidly got behind his pris-
oner i aint hurtin him he pro-

tested he says youre his father-
and we think taint so-and weve got
to git him for it thats all

  as when a crisis is come in the trial
of a great criminal all who heard that
indictment were dumb the engineer
passed one hand dazedly across his fore-
head his quick blue eyes looked from
one member to another of the staring
group harry stood staring at the
ground both hands hanging limp his
face flooded with a scarlet agony of
shame

  says im his father repeated the
engineer some faint
appreciation of the
scene was suggested in
the beginnings of a
smile around the cor-
ners of his eyes says
im his father eh
yes we knew he
was making it all up
young peel pushed
himself forward from
the group you live
in mrs briggs board-
ing h o u s e-so
how could you be
his father

you aint his
father - are
you  harry
platt was em-
boldened to ask
you get your


smiths magazine

hand off his collar demanded the
great man pointing a sudden finger at
harrys nose harry did so

  takin the wish for the fact con-
tinued the engineer screwing his face
up into an expression of oracular final-
ity which as everybody knows is
sometimes proper to be done-as when
before a coroners jury its murder if
you wanted to kill a man but nothin
but an unavoidable accident if ye didnt
-takin that fact into consideration i
may say rockwell aint so far wrong-
maybe perhaps and all things consid-
ered now look here you boys remem-
ber just what i say and dont go saying
i said something i didnt say and
now clear out-all of you-and leave
that boy alone go on-scatter

  they scattered and herbert ventured
one worshipful glance into the face of
the protector of his person and honor
overcome with thankfulness and with
the knowledge of his own guilt he burst
into tears the engineer laid a soothing
hand on his head

  there now sonny dont cry he
said set down there till you get back
your nerve want to see me fire up

  but the burden of his extreme wick-
edness kept the boy from any very
lively appreciation of the dragon feed-
ing the fact that the engineer did not
reproach him made his shame greater
rather than less he lingered around
the doorway trying to frame up some
sort of an apology for his outrageous
claim of sonship with his hero until the
engineer positively ordered him to go
home when he finally dragged himself
away he had not been able to mention
the matter of his lies and repentance

  down the road he plodded miserable
to desperation with his misdeeds of the
past full of misgivings for the account-
ing that might be exacted of him in the
future on coming in sight of the
west end crossroads he stopped he
knew enough of boy nature to be sure
that the engineers evasive answer
hadnt satisfied his judges and the
chance of meeting them was not pleas-
ant to contemplate he went on slowly
considering the possibility of fetching
a compass around the place suddenly

there was a roar and a wild rush from
a clump of bushes beside the road he
turned instinctively as a scared cat and
sped back toward the factory but
harry the autocrat being long-legged
and muscular soon fastened a hand in
his collar

  now i got you panted the son of
the butcher while the other boys raced
up and gathered around whod you
say your father was hey

  lemme go shrieked herbert the
white color of desperation overspread-
ing his face

  your father-the engineer panted
harry he was overcome with right-
eous wrath and the other boys looked
stern and sanctified as a jury that has
just handed in a conviction your
father was nothin-but a rotten little
real-estate shark-and he got drunk and
got run over by the st louis express
yah my pa-he told me all about
you yah you dirty little-

  herbert twisted loose and flew at him
like a frenzied little animal the auto-
crat was so staggered with surprise that
he gave ground a whirling fist hit him
on the nose another connected with his
mouth before he had time to realize
that he was actually being attacked
then rage arose to inspire his superior
muscles and training herbert stag-
gered suddenly backward from the
melee under the impact of a fist that
struck full on his chin and flopped to
the ground like a log dropped small end
first the back of his head thudded
into the dust and he lay with his eyes
closed white and still

  the son of peel the grocer who had
been raising a savage war cry of
fight fight fight led a stam-
pede away from the place the crim-
inal had been punished a little more
thoroughly than even his judges had in-
tended they disclaimed responsibility
by leaving him to his own devices the
jar of his fall had made his nose bleed
presently he choked coughed moaned
and sat up there was no one in sight
the humming shriek of the ax-handle
factory filled the air mingling dizzily
with a sort of roaring inside his head

  he got to his knees and looked back
the hanvicav



in the direction of the factory he had
just time to see that the engineer was
standing at the edge of the clearing
looking toward him before a rush of
dizziness brought him once more prone
on the ground he put his hand to his
face and withdrew it sticky and red
with blood then he heard the quick
sound of the engineers feet running
two strong arms picked him up and he
was carried swiftly comfortably back
to the factory

  the engineer put him down on a pile
of shavings got him a drink and told
him to lie quiet he obeyed feeling
much improved because of the water
and rather important because of his
wounds while the engineer fed the
dragon he watched fearlessly looking
quite blissful and cherubic

  feelin better now son asked the
great man and when herbert said he
was the engineer suggested that they go
outside where the air was better and
there wasnt so much noise there he
was sitting telling the engineer the
whole story of his troubles when his
mother came in sight on the road she
was hurrying along in the direction of
the school with her little black bonnet
jolted somewhat askew by her haste
and the engineer had to call her several
times before she heard

  herbert listened with pleasure while
she thanked the engineer and the en-
gineer assured her that it was no trou-
ble at all and then walked homeward
by her side although he repeated the
whole story of that afternoons crime
and punishment she reproached him
scarcely more than the engineer had
done in some way his injuries seemed
to have made expiation for his wicked-
ness  he felt it in the increased tender-
ness of his mother toward him and it
made him rejoice as a sinner whose sins
have been forgiven

  after supper he lay on the sofa be-
fore the opened front window with a
cooling bandage around his head and
watched the twilight steal in over the
vague green cornfields on the other side
of the railway tracks on the front
porch just outside the window his
mother was peeling potatoes for the

next mornings breakfast suddenly he
caught a glimpse of a tall man dressed
in very fashionable black clothes com-
ing around the side of the porch his
mother arose hastily dropping her par-
ing knife from where he lay he noticed
a pink color come into her cheeks

  good evening mrs rockwell i just
thought id drop around and see if the
boy was coming  all right said the
man and then herbert dazedly realized
that it was the engineer he lay back
on the couch struggling with the prob-
lem of the change in the engineers ap-
pearance he remembered the story of
proteus the old man of the sea who
could change himself into a hundred
different persons perhaps the en-
gineer in addition to his other herolike
characteristics could do something like
that

  with pride he heard the engineer ac-
cept his mothers invitation to step up
on the porch and sit a while with ap-
probation he heard her thank the great
man for his interest in her son

  hes a fine lad said the engineer
ill sort of look out for him after this
if youd like me to to see that the other
boys dont bully him too much its
queer what funny notions a bunch of
boys will get aint it

  then he heard them talking about
different things their voices gradually
blending as he grew sleepy into a sing-
song rhythm without beginning or end
there was a sort of feeling about the
rhythm a feeling that made him con-
tented and happy without exactly know-
ing why he frequently had feelings
about things of which his reason told
him little or nothing

  so now this feeling of his assured
him that everything about him was good
and happy and full of hope-his
mother the engineer everything in
some dim way it reminded him of his
dream that the engineer was his father
and let him throw a handful of shavings
into the dragons mouth although he
had not dreamed that dream on a fri-
day night nor yet told it on a saturday
morning his peculiarly joyful feeling
almost persuaded him that it would
come true

          less writers have posted with no stamp if you have failed to receive a reply
          to your letter you may know that it is for one of these three reasons-editors

an english lady of title has ap-
peared on the dance-hall stage
and crusty old college professors
are practicing-behind closed doors-
the light fantastic toe what does it
all mean are we going mad is the
world coming to an end  or is our
present-day pace so rapid that we re-
quire further exhilaration to keep it up
happily none of these the tremen-
dous interest now being taken in the
dance by all sorts and conditions of
people is simply a wholesome reaction
against the stultifying effect of mod-
ernism

  we cannot trace the origin of the
dance it is lost in remote antiquity
and from the very beginning of time it
has existed in one form or another
every race and every grade of society
has its representative dance which
gives expression to the nature or tem-
per of the people thus the highland
fling is a very different dance from the

irish jig the spanish dances are al-
most entirely confined to sex while the
stately minuet is characterized by an
elegance expressive of the most formal
and polite society

  it is only within our time that the
art and beauty of dancing has descend-
ed grossly and been almost effaced by
our overwhelming commercialism
still the tr j spirit of the dance always
survives ana inc keen ardor with which
it is being pursued now proves how
great is our desire to throw off the arti-
ficial shackles that bind us and to re-
vive an art that enables us to give true
expression to human emotions

  it is a long long time since we have
danced only for the love of god and
many of us do not even know that
dancing was the handmaiden of religion
in those far-away days when men lived
ideas but dancing has fallen into
evil ways says some one not at all
evil to him who evil thinks is just
dancing for health youth and beauty 

as apt as that beauty lies only in the
eye of the beholder furthermore
beauty that enters through the senses
has an inspiring rather than a degrad-
ing effect

  the wonderful impetus given to
everyday dancing in this country is un-
 questionably due in large part to the
marvelous performances of the russian
imperial ballet dancers whose exquisite
art enables them to interpret every
shade of the human soul the revival
of the classical art has been developed

ing forms a necessary part of every
boys education men are endowed with
far more grace poise and high-bred
manners than characterize the men of
our country it is very true that our
people are intent on more strenuous
matters but that is not all it is be-
cause in america boys are not regu-
larly educated in the dance and there-
fore never become apt but remain awk-
ward and clumsy

a well-known dancing master in new
york city declares that boys should be

this physical-culture dancing imparts lightness swiftness delicacy grace and ease to all ones

by an american woman who has since
become famous her exquisite interpre-
tations are like a quaff of nectar to a
parched throat she draws her inspira-
tions from rhythmical nature-the
trees the clouds the waves dancing
sunbeams et cetera-and from every-
thing that is noblest in the human soul

  aside from the highest power that
dancing possesses-the power of ex-
pressing emotion-it has others and
perhaps even greater qualities in its
psychological effect and in its physio-
logical action in europe where danc-

made to attend dancing classes regularly
from the sixth to the twelfth years
during this time they would accumu-
late grace that they would never lose
and they would become so well ground-
ed in the foundations of the art that
they would be splendidly equipped for
any future social life into which they
might enter even though they might
never dance they would have acquired
an ease of manner and of deportment
that it is very difficult to assume in
later years again a knowledge of
dancing will by no means be a bin-

dranee but rather a help to the more
strenuous out-of-door games and sports
in which a healthy lusty boy of twelve
enlists

  since the object of dancing is pri-
marily enjoyment it necessarily brings
out the lighter and more wholesome
qualities smiles instead of tears so it
infuses into the atmosphere a blending
a mixture of joy happiness arid hope
an optimism regarding lifes problems
that may be termed the spirit of the
dance women being far more emo-
tional than men experience this to a
greater extent and therefore are
greater devotees of the art and more
expert dancers

  while dancing is an art and an ac-
complishment it is above all the high-
est form of physical culture and both
men and women are awakening to a
realization of its great value in this re-
spect and are practicing it for physio-
logical purposes

  those who first become acquainted
with the art of dancing after reaching
maturity are horrified at the stiffness of
their joints at their ungainly gestures
at their complete ignorance of body
balance to rhythmic tones and this
discomfiture is heightened by observ-
ing their awkwardness and clumsy
movements in comparison with others
one who is well balanced becomes a
good dancer and this very essential
human attribute-balance or mental
poise-can be acquired and developed
in the dance

  it must not be supposed however
that the execution of graceful evolu-
tions can be performed without a good
deal of preliminary practice it is there-
fore a capital plan to devote a short
period each day to such simple exercises
as will limber the joints and impart
pliancy to the muscles these exer-
cises are so simple that they scarcely
require an explanation for instance
stand firmly upon the floor and slowly
raise and lower the body upon the toes
then rise upon the toes balance and
rock the body gently from side to side
by means of the ankles only next
lower the body to the floor from the
hips by unhinging the knee joints as it

were next sway the body from side to
side with hip action alone

  after this it is well to study the es-
sential positions of the feet unless this
is correctly understood much of the
value of dancing is lost in all these
positions the body should be held erect
the shoulders thrown back and the
knees kept perfectly straight and turned
outward in the construction of dances
these positions combined form steps
steps united make movements and
aside from the fact that these move-
ments when arranged together form
dances it is by means of these move-
ments that advanced physical culturists
are overcoming many physical weak-
nesses deficiencies and actual diseases
such as rheumatic joints and muscular
rheumatism obesity indigestion en-
larged liver feeble circulatory systems
and so on

  fhe correct positions of the body in
dancing are five the first position is
formed by placing the heels together
and throwing the toes back so that the
feet form a straight line in the first
attempts at this position the toes should
not be turned out more than will admit
of the body maintaining its proper bal-
ance they must be brought to the
proper position only by degrees until
the feet can be placed heel to heel in a
straight line without affecting the
steadiness of the body or arms

  the second position is formed by
moving the right or left foot sideways
from the first position to about the dis-
tance of its own length from the heel of
the standing foot of the foot thus
placed the heel must be raised so that
the toe alone rests on the ground the
instep being bent as much as possible
and the foot retaining its original direc-
tion outward tn this case as in the
first the foot should be brought by de-
grees to perform this action correctly
and the toes thrown back as far as ones
power to preserve body balance will
permit

  the third position is formed by draw-
ing the moving foot from the second
position to the middle of the front of
the standing foot the feet being kept
close to each other so that the heel of
dancing fqcr health youth ant beauty 

one who is well balanced becomes a good dancer and balance or mental poise can be acquired and

developed in the dance

one is brought to the ankle of the other
so they are nearly half crossed

  the fourth position in this the foot
is moved about its own length forward
from the third position keeping the heel
forward and the toe backward during
the progress of the foot

  the fifth position draw the foot
back from the fourth position so that
its heel is brought close to the toe of
the other foot the feet being completely
crossed the heel of the moving foot
is gradually brought to the ground as it
approaches the standing foot

  these five positions should be prac-
ticed alternately the balance being sus-
tained throughout by the opposite foot
if when one foot is placed in advance
of the other you balance your body on
the foot that is in front the other foot
is in the fourth position behind and it
is the same with regard to the third and
fifth positions when the weight is on the
foremost foot the positions if prop-
erly made will form a perfect cross

  now the simple preliminary exercises
given above should be performed while

practicing these positions for instance
bending the hips and knees so as to turn
the latter outward and rather backward
without raising the heel and while low-
ering the body still keeping it perfectly
erect imparts flexibility to the instep
and greatly improves the balance in
this exercise the knees should be but
slightly bent at first and it may be nec-
essary to support oneself on a firm ob-
ject until greater power and facility are
acquired

  now when the bends in the various
positions can be performed perfectly
without any support and without dis-
composing the proper state of the body
at the conclusion of each bend rise
upon the toes keeping the knees
straight and the feet in their exact po-
sitions this points the feet and in-
creases the power of instep and ankle
now practice balancing of the body on
one foot extend the other in the second
or fourth position raise it as high as
the knee allow it to fall into the fifth
position and cross either behind or be-
fore

  these foot-and-leg exercises are
called physical-culture dancing and im-
part lightness swiftness delicacy
grace and ease to all ones body move-
ments and immensely facilitate the
rhythmic action of dancing even if
the dance is not the object sought
these steps correct weak and clumsy
ankles as well as other mild joint and
muscular deficiencies and should be in-
dulged in if only for the acquirement
of grace and suppleness

  much has been heard lately of the
freakishness of present-day dancing
things only become freakish when out
of their environment the turkey trot
-now called the one step in polite
society-if genuinely danced in a fash-
ionable ballroom becomes ludicrous
because the turkey trot is an evolution
of the cakewalk now the cakewalk
if done fittingly is a wonderful means
of expression of that class who origi-
nated it seen in proper surroundings
the cakewalk is delightful but shorn of
its elemental characteristics it becomes
a hybrid a freak a degeneracy

  these same steps and figures modi-
fied or refined and attuned to ahigher
class of society constitute the turkey
trot it is done in two-four time with
very pretty figures and is a great im-
provement and really an advancement
upon our ordinary commonplace pro-
saic two-step aside and apart from
adding zest to the dance and giving it
a new interest it is an admirable form
of exercise

  in the first place the movement
should be graceful rise on the foot
as if stepping on an egg and afraid to
break it there must be no shuffling
advance gracefully lightly on the toes
counting eight reverse eight two
measures of four each around followed
by the side or wing step weight being
thrown on the forward step wing on
the back step

  this completes the dance with some
but it contains another and very pretty
figure the grapevine which consists of
four steps done diagonally side-step-
ping all the while there is absolutely
nothing bizarre about the turkey trot
when done becomingly  the action is all

from the hips and ankles the arms
must not be swung in fact must not
he used at all the sway and rhythm of
the body being done entirely with the
lower joints

  the turkey trot when rapidly exe-
cuted becomes a very good and easy
means of reducing ones weight

  better than this however are the
new waltz steps introduced some yeas
ago by a fashionable dancing master in
boston and known as the boston
short the long boston the dip
and the glide all these steps are
sometimes combined into one dance the
execution of which brings into very
active play every muscle in the body
it is a very strenuous dance and the
combination is rarely seen in a ball-
room being performed by professionals
or privately of all these steps the
long boston is doubtless the only one
that will survive properly danced it is
perhaps the most graceful of all dances
but one seldom sees it correctly done

  the tango-argentina a spanish
dance recently introduced has met with
great favor it is most delightful but
contains a great many steps and there-
fore is not only difficult to acquire but
impossible to dance with many on the
floor it is really a spanish minuet
and the revival of these graceful
dances with the exquisite courtesy nec-
essary to make them successful opens
tremendous educational possibilities for
the rising generation

  the bending swaying rising and
falling inflections of the body in the
spanish dances are among the best pos-
sible methods of treating myriads of
functional derangements to which flesh
is heir notably rheumatic ailments and
obesity beside the physiological im-
provement that invariably follows a
systematic course of physical-culture
dancing the rejuvenating influence
upon ones spirit must not be over-
looked

  in the great cities where life is one
ceaseless round of strenuous endeavor
men and women who arc accomplishing
the worlds work engage in the dance
and more and more is this means of re-
laxation and rejuvenation sought and

dancing for health youth and bbauty

found and more and more is it being
pursued because despite much that has
latterly been uttered against the new
lances they are filling a need and in
so doing the best that is in them will
prevail and endure

  note  lubrication of the feet not
only keeps them pliant and young en-
hances their usefulness and facilitates
their action but prevents foot troubles

answers to correspondents

  jimmie-the fashion of using hair oils
has recently been revived and it is a good
one as it cleanses the scalp doing away
thereby with so much washing and nourishes
the hair as well a german preparation
that has been in use for years is called
klettenwurzel haar oel known in this
country as burdock root hair oil

olive or benne oil  ounces

fresh burdock root   ounces

castor oil   ounce

oil of bergamot  t dram

oil of rose geranium j dram

  digest the olive or benne oil with the
burdock root for about one-half hour at a
moderate heat then decant the clear liquid
add the other oils and color if desired with
any coloring matter you choose coloring
adds only to the appearance not to the vir-
tue of the preparation many so-called
burdock hair oils do not contain any burdock
root at all and most of them are put up
with oil of benne instead of olive oil be-
cause it is cheaper

  effie-a bust of a disfiguring size may
be reduced by the following means

tristol   grams

white vaseline  grams

essence of peppermint  drops

   this is well rubbed into the parts which
are then covered with a compress soaked in

alum   grams

acetate of lead   grams

distilled water  grams

  cover the compress with oiled silk and
keep on for twelve hours

  this treatment must be pursued nightly
for months before results are gained

  jannette-probably the reason why you
always find an eruption at the seat of former
blackheads is because you squeeze them out
with your finger nails this is bad practice
correct treatment for these disfiguring facial
blemishes will be sent you on application

  john-yes from your description i judge
that they are blackheads these blemishes

frequently appear on the chest and back as
well as upon the face in such situations
they can be given more vigorous treatment
because the skin is not so sensitive as it is
on the face pulverized pumice applied
daily with a bath brush should remove them
from these situations

anxious-small scars resulting from se-
vere acne can be removed directions will
be sent on application

jerry-the term blackheads is not given
to these unsightly facial blemishes because
they are actual worms with black heads
they consist of accumulated oily matter
thrown out by the glands of bacteria and
of soil or grime in other words of dirt
on the surface of these tiny masses which
gives them a black appearance when they
are squeezed out the black tip emerges first
the remainder of the mass is light in color
and the minute speck appears like a grub
whenever blackheads resist persistent treat-
ment the daily habits of life are faulty
health rules as well as treatment for black-
heads will be mailed  application

e t milwaukee-a simple face bleach
consists of

lemon juice   ounces

rain or rose or distilled water  pint

write for stronger bleaches if you wish
them

hulda-many requests come to this de-
partment for a shampoo such as is used by
high-class hair specialists the following is
a very popular one

white castile soap   ounce

potassium carbonate  i dram

borax   drams

cologne water   ounces

bay rum   ounces

water to make   ounces

scrape the soap and dissolve in the water
over heat occasionally replacing the water
lost by evaporation add the borax and po-
tassium carbonate then the cologne water
and bay rum and filter

timothy-equal parts of olive oil and
chloroform is an old and favorite remedy
for earache saturate a piece of cotton and
place it in the ear cover it with a larger
piece of dry cotton

mary-you will find the following a very
elegant preparation for oily skin

oil of rosemary   dram

oil of lavender t xi drams

oil of petit grain   drops

tincture of balm   drams

orange-flower water   pint

spirits of wine   pint

it can be used clear on the skin or diluted
with water for a face bath
