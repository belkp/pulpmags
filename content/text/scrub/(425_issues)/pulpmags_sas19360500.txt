bill wasnt seeking adven-
ture he was only a sew-
ing-machine salesman in
albania but when he dis-
honored the young princess
by looking at her face he
found himself in a net of
royal intrigue and romance

at the first outbreak of firing
from the hill on the left bill
hendricks escort fled before
bill had quite taken in what was hap-
pening his three tosks were galloping
wildly back along the mountain trail
upon their mules but what was far
worse in bills eyes was that the span
of mules that drew his cart containing
half-a-dozen samples of his new model
f sewing-machine were following at a
pace that ensured almost instant de-
struction

destruction came the vehicle swerv-
ed the mules kicked reared plunged in
their traces and then mules and cart
and precious models were lying in an
indistinguishable heap at the bottom of
the ravine

crack crack the rifles were blazing
from the hill but bill had already seen
what his guides might have seen if they
had not been so panic-stricken the hid-


princess

very bad men along
these roads he warned
protestingly the signore
and signora must stay here
tonight

by
lew
merrill

den marksmen were not firing at him
and his party but at the party of four
that had been visible for two hours past
ascending the hill ahead of them

  three men and a woman the head
tosk had said though to bills eyes each
of the four was only a tiny figure upon
a mule

  now as bill watched he saw two of
the party drop in their tracks the third
was kneeling replying to the rifle firing
as for the fourth that shrouded figure
-yes bill could see it was a woman
now-she remained seated on her mule
apparently paralyzed by fear into in-
ertness

  but the hidden marksmen were not
shooting at her a woman was safe by
immemorial tradition in albania nor
was there any likelihood that she would
be struck by a stray bullet marksman-
ship was too good ammunition too preci-
ous even as bill watched he saw the
third man keel over and lie prone on the
ground in the gathering darkness

till had kicked his mule savagely
in the flanks and was already on his

way to aid beauty in distress beauty
apparently panic-stricken was now spur-
ring her mule along the upland trail and
most of the mule was hidden in a flutter
of flying draperies but still a mile and
an intervening ridge separated her from
him

  before he had topped the ridge he
heard her screaming dimly in front of
her he could see her struggling with
three armed men who seemed to be at-
tempting to kidnap her her furious
resistance sent the draperies flying in all
directions revealing a flurry of youthful
loveliness

  bills appearance upon the scene took
the marauders wholly by surprise they
had apparently drapped their rifles for
the moment and now they made frantic
efforts to grab them too late bills
automatic cracked and the slug caught
marauder no  in the arm or shoulder
marauder no  ducked and began
streaking for the hills followed by his
two companions without their rifles it
was evident they were unwilling to face
the newcomer

  bill picked up the rifles and quickly
tossed them into the ravine behind him
before turning to the girl who was
crouching sobbing beside her mule

a s bill approached she grabbed up
an armful of drapery and tried to
throw it about her then got all tangled
up in it till she looked like a mummy
struggling to get out of its case she
seemed at present to be attired in a slip
and some kind of panties but the slip
had been tom in the struggle half re-
vealing two small rounded breasts and
flashes of white skin below them

soft kid boots reaching to the thighs

apparently supplied the place of stock-
ings there was a white line between
the top of either boot and the lower
rim of the panties which were frilled
like a fashion picture of the eighteen
seventies and the panties themselves
threatened every minute to cut loose
from a criss-cross waist-strap that ap-
peared to support them

  the girl herself was perhaps twenty
years old light brown hair eyes that
were probably blue or gray by day the
prettiest thing bill had ever seen his
heart was gone in a moment

  dont be afraid ive come to help
you he said in italian bills italian
wasnt very good-not as good as his
french for he had sold sewing-machines
in tours for three years before taking on
the head agency for italy

  but the girl began sobbing and chat-
tering volubly in french she had begun
to disengage herself from the draperies
now but the only result was to enlarge
the rent in the slip then both little
breasts slipped out and bill felt his
heart begin pounding she was so small
so dainty so desirable

  let me help you he answered in
the same language

  no no go away i am shamed for
ever now you have seen my face

  and it was her face that she was try-
ing to cover with the tangle of draperies
and not the rest of her she didnt seem
to care a damn about what else he saw
so long as bill didnt see her face

  he tried to pull the draperies away
to wrap them about her and she
screamed and struggled till he was
forced to desist the slip was swiftly
resolving itself into a mass of tatters
and the panties were maintaining their
position by a miracle but the girls face
was completely hidden in the draperies
puppet princess

  when this was done bill pulled them
down about her until every trace of the
feminine human form had disappeared
then he picked the girl up in his arms
and placed her upon her mule

  which way he asked

  that way that way she sobbed
pointing up the track and still she kept
her face concealed and she didnt care
at all that one of the prettiest legs in
the world even though hidden in a kid
boot was showing over the side-saddle

  that way she repeated castle
adjevo i

dill understood then for castle ad-
jevo was his own destination it
belonged to prince michael adjevo one
of the christian lords of albania and
he was at war with prince hasean of
the beni-hassan tribe mohammedans
all through the early part of that day
bill had heard the crackle of italian
musketry fire as the italian expedition-
ary force endeavored to push its way to
the scene of the disturbance and restore
order since italy was protector of al-
bania

  bill hadnt been greatly interested
what he wanted to do was to introduce
the new model f sewing-machine among
the tribesmen or rather tribeswomen
you can go into the wilds of albania
turkeyor siberia where the nomads
pitch their goatskin tents and you may
not find much else but youll always find
a sewing-machine

  youll probably find them in the back
blocks of arabia too for the sewing-
machine is the one american invention
that has commended itself to uncivilized
womankind from pole to pole

  and the model f was a beauty it
didnt operate by power of course but
it ran so smoothly on its ball-bearings



and it never got out of order bill had
been sold on the model f the moment
he got his first consignment from the
factory

  and bill was confident he could sell
model f to the tune of twenty-five
thousand in albania

  so he had crossed the narrow adriatic
from civilized italy into the one bar-
barous land remaining in south-eastern
europe an unknown land of mountains
where half-savage tribes have maintained
a feudal independence since the days of
noah-that is to say since the albania
mountains rose out of the floods

utty poor friend you are mad
said the italian consul at durazzo
all albania is engaged in tribal war-
fare and if you listen youll be able to
hear the guns of our expeditionary force
cracking down castles once across that
chain of mountains and nobody can
help you

  nobodys going to hurt me said
bill not when theyve seen the model
f boy its a dandy im taking half-a-
dozen chromium-plated ones up there
to present to the ladies of the chief-
tains

  youll never come back said the
consul and i forbid you to go

dill had just slipped out of durazzo
with his escort and the cart now
his model fs were lying at the bottom
of the gorge and bill was jogging along
side by side with the unknown girl
through the gathering darkness now
and again the wide top of the kid boot
would brush his leg and send a thrill
up and down his spine

  but the girls face was completely
hidden in the draperies and she was
sobbing spasmodically


spicy-adventure stories

i am ruined she moaned heed-
less of his protests you have
seen my face-what is there left
now

hphe inn sprawled into the middle of
the road and the inn-keeper was vol-
uble insistent

  but the signore and signora cannot
travel further tonight he explained in
profuse italian very bad men along
the roads in the morning it will be safe
you must stay here

  castle adjevo was seventeen miles
further along the road bill had learned
and both the mules were mule-tired and
preparing for that display of mulish ob-
stinacy that consists in lying down and
refusing to move on

  we shall have to stay here bill
said to the girl

  very well it is for you to decide
she answered in her fluent french

  bill got down off his mule and a tosk
boy shooshed it into the stable he lifted
his companion down

  we want two rooms he said to the
inn-keeper

  very nice rooms replied the italian
come with me i fix you

  about fifteen minutes later bill was
sitting opposite his veiled companion in a
single room each of them had a steam-
ing omelette and a bottle of albanian
wine the table was set in the center
of the enormous room but it was only
one room

  there was an enormous bed which yet
occupied only an insignificant portion of
the room there was a magnificent night
view of the mountains there was the
puppet princess



romantic presence of the fairveiled un-
known whose face bill had seen only
for a few moments

bill hadnt asked her any questions
but she seemed more composed now-or
else it was the strong albanian wine
released her repression

i must thank you so much for rescu-
ing me from those men said the girl
in her rapid perfect french you are
monsieur beel hendrick yes

now how do you know that asked
bill

but everybody in albania knows that
you have brought a new sewing-machine
into the country all the women are
talking about it they await you mon-
sieur beel

god groaned bill and those sam-
ple machines are lying down in that
gorge

i must introduce myself i am the
princess clothilde of the assabaian
clan the oldest in the country mon-
sieur beel you wonder that i speak
french but my sister and i had a
french governess my father was very
progressive even though he retained all
our old albanian customs

i am betrothed to prince michael
adjevo the marriage is for tomorrow
he is the last of his line and so an
heir is considered a matter of urgency
prince hassan the accursed moslem
sent his men to kidnap me on the way
you saved me tomorrow you take me


spicy-adventure stories

on to the castle and i remain always
your grateful friend is it not so
why i-i guess so answered bill
a little dumbfounded by the girls forth-
rightness and i guess i can get the
landlord to fix me up with a bed some-
where else

  but my friend my rescuer what is
the matter with this bed inquired the
princess clothilde it is a beautiful
bed it is big enough for four people

till lost his head not that he
showed it in any outward action
but the situation had become so weird
and impossible that he decided to wait
upon events

  boom boom boom somewhere in
the distance an italian field gun was fir-
ing upon the disturbers of the albanian
peace the echoes came rolling back
from the mountain tops bill heard the
sounds in a dim way but he remained
in a state of mental knockout wondering
what was going to happen

  for clothilde had removed her drap-
eries leaving her face swathed in a
heavy veil and was quite evidently mak-
ing ready to retire for the night those
little piquant breasts of hers were peep-
ing forth unashamed and unabashed be-
neath the tatters of the ripped slip and
clothilde acted as if she didnt know a
thing about it

  she had removed the kid thigh-boots
and two exquisitely tapered legs showed
milky white from the perfectly formed
toes and slender ankles up to the frilled
edge of the step-ins which still hung
crazily suspended from the waistband

  if those fall down im gone bill
said to himself

  but they didnt fall down in another
minute clothilde was snuggly esconced
in the bed in the torn slip and step-ins

and was pulling the blankets up to her
veiled face and motioning to bill to
occupy part of the remaining three-
fourths of the piece of furniture

  very gingerly and still feeling that
it was all a dream bill divested himself
of his shoes and coat and crawled into
the bed he lay there breathing hard
and trying to pull himself together

  then suddenly there was a movement
beside him two soft arms were around
his neck two small breasts were crushed
against him a rounded knee was press-
ing his and the face of the princess un-
veiled now was close against his own
two moist warm lips met his own in
clinging kiss

  say listen clothilde remember-
youre going to be married to prinee
michael tomorrow protested bill

  i do not care you are the first man
who has seen my face except my father
and my brothers what is there left
now 

  it was almost as if she were accusing
bill of having betrayed her

  yes you have taken away my in-
nocence continued clothilde snuggling
up to him besides i have never been
within twenty feet of a man before mon
dieu how nice men are i never dreamed
it kiss me again

  princess youre a dream said bill
but i-damn it dont you see im re-
sponsible for you and-oh hell i mean
diable

  bill leaped out of the bed snatched
up his coat and shoes and vanished from
the room

tn a shed behind the inn bill spent the

  night alternately thanking himself and
cursing himself but what else could he
have done love was love and maybe
he wasnt under any obligations to
puppet princess



prince michael but hed come to albania
to sell the model f and he didnt intend
to let anything interfere with duty

  when he went back to the bedroom in
the cold unromantic light of dawn he
found the princess sitting with her face
veiled at the table finishing up the wine
his reception was quite a chilly one

tyty friend i thank you from
depths of my heart we have all
heard of you and of the wonderful
sewing-machine that you are contribut-
ing to the cause of civilization and you
must remain my honored guest during
the period of my nuptials

  so spoke prince michael adjevo on
the following afternoon his followers
had met bill and clothilde on their way
toward the castle and conducted them
there it was a crazy old feudal building
at least a thousand years old with a cen-
tral keep and a moat and thick stone
walls that would have been proof against
at least three discharges from a field-
gun

  as for prince michael he was a fine
young fellow fair-haired blue-eyed six
feet tall and carrying himself with the
aplomb of a princeton graduate

  bill had been assigned a room in the
keep tosk servants had brought him
scented water to wash in now he was
in the huge banquet hall for it was the
wedding feast and the prince and clo-
thilde had already been united in the
chapel by the resident bishop

  bill was seated not far away from
prince michael at michaels side sat
clothilde her face very much swathed
in fact she had reverted to the mummy
again bill was wondering what prince
michael would think if he knew that
he had seen those little breasts under
those wrappings probably prince mich-

ael wouldnt have cared a damn but you
couldnt tell it was all crazy crazy

  clothilde wasnt looking at bill she
hadnt looked at him since his return to
the bedroom and she hadnt spoken to
him either

  well they were man and wife now
and all that remained was to get in some
new model fs and show them to the
ladies

  but clothilde was the only lady pres-
ent at the marriage feast the table
reaching all along the hall was packed
with prince michaels retainers huge
husky men with moustaches beards and
whiskers and their belts stuffed full with
daggers and antique pistols

  clothilde was sitting on michaels
right on his left was the priest wear-
ing a flowing black veil over his funny
little rimmed hat michael was on his
feet apparently replying to some toast
everybody had been toasting and bill
was a little drunk even he had stood up
and toasted the bride nobody had un-
derstood him but there had been a gen-
eral atmosphere of harmony and good-
feeling

a nd what happened took place like
lightning a dozen men leaping out
from behind the altar the crack of very
modern automatics prince michael stag-
gering back slumping into the priests
arms six men down and the rest rush-
ing forward with roars of rage against
the assassins

  it all happened so quickly that bill
was simply out of it in an instant the
long hall was a jam of fighting men dag-
gers against guns a bedlam of murder-
ous invectives shrieks groans of the
falling

  then the assassins were in flight with
michaels men streaming after them and


spicy-adventure stories

bill was with prince michael and the
priest and clothilde

  they were trying to raise prince
michael to his feet but his face was
blue and he lay inert in their arms six
dagger wounds were in his body and
one of them had pierced his heart

  then something snapped in bills
brain he forgot all about model f he
drew his automatic and rushed behind
the altar to join the battling throng
whose yells were receding in the cata-
combs beneath the castle

ttours later bill returned with
prince michaels adherents the in-
vaders apparently had found some secret
ingress into the castle michaels men
had repulsed them only to run into three
times their number of prince hassans
men who were preparing for an assault

  the castle was surrounded but it had
stood many sieges in the past the walls
were crumbling but the central keep was
inviolable the score and more of de-
fenders retreated into this citadel from
which they hurled defiance at the howl-
ing moslems who surrounded them

  protected by the outer walls prince
hassans men poured in frequent fusil-
lades which spent themselves harmlessly
against the stone walls of the keep

  on a bier in the chapel lay prince
michaels body bill had forgotten all
about his model f he hadnt seen
death before in quite this swift dra-
matic way

  it was the princes chamberlain a
little elderly tosk who drew bill aside
late in the night when there was a tem-
porary lull in the activities of the be-
siegers

  in his halting italian he explained
prince michael was the last of his line
which reaches back to the time of the

great julius caesar we hoped there
would be an heir otherwise you under-
stand the kingdom passes-

  yes well said bill

  there must be an heir whispered
the chamberlain they were married
and they were together for a few min-
utes while he took the veil from her
face which no other man has looked
upon

  i still dont get you quite said bill
as well as he could in italian

  in those few minutes an heir-an
heir might have been sent by god but
it was not her highness is a lady of
such modesty-

  well but still- said bill

  there is nobody in the castle whom
we could trust but you you would not
betray us and you will be going away
after that wolf prince hassan has been
defeated

  now im beginning to get you an-
swered bill

  we have talked it over her high-
ness understands and has agreed for
reasons of state she awaits you now
yes it was all like a crazy dream bill
just stared at the chamberlain for a half-
minute before he found his tongue
you mean i-

  yes signore americano for the
sake of the adjevo dynasty it should
not be so hard

  no its not hard said bill but
how do you know-how do you know
that- well how do you know that any-
thing would happen in consequence
the little chamberlain stroked bills
sleeve my dear friend he answered
it always happens in albania the
royal bed has just been blessed

ves it was all a dream just a crazy
dream the huge four-poster in the
center of the room and the mummified
puppet princess




spicy-adventure stories

lady lying in it her face heavily veiled
the priest beside the bed the two
women in waiting dressed in the pic-
turesque albanian garb and the little
chamberlain

  bill stood in the middle of the room
his head was still swimming from the
heady albanian wine he couldnt see
anything of clothilde but just wrappings
and wrappings

  well asked bill

  everything is ready signore

  then why dont you all get the hell
out of here  asked bill in english
pardon signore

  allez-yous-en alles a venfer beat
it scram

  but signore i am the chamberlain
this is the priest who has blessed the
bed there must be records

  bill saw the two young albanian girls
looking at him with expectation in their
eyes suddenly it dawned on him that
he was dealing with folks of a prehis-
toric civilization never if he lived to
be a centenarian could he make his
mind adjust itself to theirs

  what do you think i am asked
bill heatedly

  signore 

  im through bill shouted in italian
i came here to sell model f sewing-
machines not to become the father of a
dynasty im going home

  but signore signore- protested the
little chamberlain it is essential that
there be an heir and it must be in ac-
cordance with etiquette you will not
refuse her highness 

  i tell you im through said bill
doggedly

  and somehow clothilde seemed to un-
derstand in another moment she was
upon her feet a blazing fury she
whirled the draperies about her face and

head revealing once more the pert little
breasts and those crazy lop-sided step-
ins and she was making for bills face
with nails like claws

  this is the second time he has dared
to insult me she cried in french i
cannot hve in such humiliation

  bill caught her by the wrists she was
wrestling madly with him breast to
breast and shaking with indignation

  next moment the room was a riot
the priest and the little chamberlain
were dancing madly around the two
trying to stop the scrap and the two
ladies-in-waiting were on the job too
infuriated at the disappointment of their
expectations and getting in some nasty
rakings from their own nails on bills
face

  then in the midst of it there arose a
frantic din outside bill could distinguish
just one word beni-hassan

the troops of prince hassan were
storming the keep there burst forth
the savage crack of rifles the yells of
combat the shrieks of wounded men

  bill grabbed his automatic thrust in a
fresh clip of cartridges and ran from
the bridal chamber

  in the starlight as he reached the out-
side of the keep he saw a hundred men
beating back the few defenders daggers
were flashing rifle butts were cracking
down on heads the adjevo clan was
yielding before the moslems beaten back
by sheer numbers

  bill emptied his automatic twice be-
fore it was torn from his hands and he
went staggering back half-numbed by a
sword-stroke across the head fortun-
ately the flat of the blade

  then the keep had been won and bill
was fighting his way through a maze of
jet black passages ignorant who was
friend and who was foe
puppet princess



  the beni-hassan seemed to be mas-
ters of the situation they had appar-
ently accounted for practically all the
males within the castle they were get-
ting acquainted with the ladies if those
feminine squeals that bill could hear had
any significance it looked as if the two
little ladies-ih-waiting were having ro-
mances of their own instead of having
to enjoy them vicariously

  bill hadnt the vestige of an idea where
he was for the sword-blow had com-
pletely dazed him he was just fighting
his way through the darkness when an-
other human form encountered his

  bill caught it by the throat and then
his grip slackened as he felt two conical
mounds against his chest and a wealth
of hair sweeping his face he must
have shouted for suddenly two slender
arms were about his neck

  signore beel ah mon dieu i
thought you were dead come with me
the catacombs i know the secret for
i learned it when they brought me here
as a child to betroth me to prince
michael

  bill let himself be conducted now
there was another maze of passages
and gradually the shouting died away in
the distance there followed perfect
peace and perfect silence

tthen a great flood of light from a
newly risen moon bill found himself
standing with clothilde in a great exca-
vation underneath the castle which tow-
ered up pile upon pile of wall and para-
pet

  again he could hear the faint sounds
of shouting but they seemed to come
from far overhead to all intent and
purpose they two were alone

  beyond them bill could see the moat
and the rugged hills there seemed a
way to freedom

  i must go back said bill thickly i
cant desert your people

  no answered clothilde it is ended
now she began giggling they tried
to catch me but i was too quick for
them she said poor little modjesta
she always said she wanted to be in a
town when it was captured by an enemy
well she has got her wish now signore
americano you have seen my face you
have taken away my innocence now
what are you going to do about it

  and then in the moonlight suddenly
clothildes face was revealed to bill
again she had torn away the draperies
and it might have been the face of any
very pretty amerioa girl for after all
the albanians were the oldest white race
in europe and their blood was probably
flowing in the veins of two-thirds of the
nobility of england france italy and
america

  youve got me beat bill muttered
thickly for the impact of that sword
blade still left him groggy what was a
man to do hed fought his best and
here he was in the catacombs of the
castle with the prettiest girl he had ever
seen in his life

  with a superb gesture clothilde tore
away the draperies that clung to her
and let them fall upon the stones

  she stood there in the slip which was
little more than a rag now there was
no longer any attempt at hiding those
two small breasts that tried to push their
dauntless way through the rents in it
pert and completely shameless they ap-
pealed to bill as if they were asking
what he intended to do about it all

  clothilde shivered her arms went
out about bills neck and clung in a
stranglehold she was shaking

  oh lord groaned bill now listet

art the chauffeur said to hell
with it what is there to see
he sat in the front seat of the
parked automobile and glowered at tony
bulotti who sat behind the glare was
returned for there was little love lost
between tony the bodyguard and art
the chauffeur

  skaggtown-what there was of it-

slept soggily ip the midday sun four
buildings on the left three on the right
beneath a tumbledown wooden awning
a hundred feet away squatted a group of
mountain men all were silent from
time to time one of the group glanced
toward the big sedan spat gustily
through yellow teeth and relapsed into
his beard and his silence

art was lifted
bodily hurled
aside   

he called himself the sword that slays the steel
that slaughters-but the vengeance he took on
the double-crossing couple was worse than death

  what in the hell is the boss doing
snorted art

  tony glanced aloft they were parked
beside a rambling two story structure
the most pretentious in skaggtown
since early morning the boss cinch
bogan of new york and points west
had been in the second story of this
decrepit structure the boss a gallon
demijohn of moonshine and the boss
woman velma were all there

  tony grinned what would you be
doing if you had that blonde off by
yourself 

  art sneered into the mirror you
know what i mean what the hell we
doing here in the first place off in the
sticks i

  the boss said he had to pay a guy
tony was mild wherever the boss was
concerned but you know what hes
doing again the leer

  a blonde stuck her head out a broken
window on the second floor she looked
at the parked sedan and said- art
art come quick

  art looked at tony tony looked at
art leered again art got out of the
car went into the rickety store went up
an equally rickety stairway he drew
aside a burlap curtain

  velma the bosss blonde lay huddled
on the bed against the opposite wall she
looked up eyes round with fear

  whats the matter kid  where

the-

  velma got up

qhe wore the remnants of an orchid
 chiffon dance set the brassiere
dangled like a surrendered battle flag
from one white shoulder disclosing
curving palpitant white flesh even the
step-ins once dainty and seductive were
in tatters her hair hung over her face
disarrayed one eye was almost closed
from the corner of her mouth a red
trickle of blood thin and crimson

  art looked at her with bulging eyes
as she staggered to her feet he wasnt
surprised at the scantiness of her attire
hed seen the bosss woman this way
before but the fear on her face the
battered wreck of her features the
tenseness of the atmosphere itself

  she huddled against him his arm
about her quivering shoulders he saw
the blue bruises on her shoulders the
splotches on her arms the crisscross
welts on her trembling body

  he groped vaguely for the holster be-
neath his own arm damn him he
grated  kill the heel  what hap-
pened 

  for a moment longer she sobbed
against him while his tiny eyes dilated
and contracted in rage he patted her
shoulder clumsily glared around the
room she whined oh art you know
how he is when he drinks like a beast 
i knew when we came up here and he
started drinking that damn moonshine
that this would happen

   ill kill the heel said art again
he accused me of carrying on with
both you and tony and then-

   art stiffened ill kill him he said
the dirty lousy rat

  she said you wont have to i did

  his eyes followed the direction of her
pointed finger

inch bogan dean of the east-
coast gamboleers rumored money
man for a dozen gangs lay on his face
behind the bed he wore reddish brown
trousers and a blue silk shirt whose color
was gradually turning red

  god from art

  he pulled the bed away knelt beside
the figure the scalp was split open
gaping and yawning a heavy metal
candlestick bent and crumpled lay be-
side the man art pulled aside the sticky
shirt saw that the bloody wound on
the muscled back was long but shallow
he turned to the girl

  i only had a pair of nail scissors
she said almost apologetically but the
candlestick was the stuff the big heel

  art listened his ear against the broad
back his face was white when he arose
then he sat heavily on the edge of the
bed

  youll have to scram baby he said
dully you done it now he aint
dead

   she lit a cigarette glared at the body
looked at the distraught art with cal-
culating eyes hed find me she said
slowly wherever i went

  arts nod was hopeless cinch bogaa
had connections he was powerful

  you told me anytime i needed help
youd go to bat for me art her voice
was pleading she laid a hand on his
shoulder swayed toward him her red
parted lips moist and trembling were
very close to his art inched away nerv-
ously

  i would kid but i aint holding
nothing three or four hundred you
can have that

  for a moment longer she stood look-
ing down at him her voice held a world
mountaineers are tough



of promise now art you know why
he came down here  why he made you
drive us to this god forsaken hole
art moved uneasily his bulging eyes
on the unconscious bleeding figure of
his boss some kind of payoff he said
she moved to the curtain that shielded
a corner of the wall drew out cinch
bogans expensive kitbag she carried it
across the room to art opened h wide
looky

  bundle after bundle of neatly taped
bills reposed in the bag art caught his
breath raised his brows how much
babe 

  plenty art plenty

  silence while they sized each other up
she came over and sat down beside him
spoke persuasively in his cauliflower ear
arts eyes gleamed

  mean it he asked a little thickly
her answer was an enveloping arm that
pulled him close to her arts skinny
chest heaved against her warm throbbing
breasts his own hands reached for soft
flesh for a moment they wavered then
art jerked away his eyes bright

  okay babe his voice was husky
im a damned fool but im in

  and tony

  ill take care of tony listen

rpen minutes later the woman
looked out the window at the cur-
tained doorway art took off his coat
rolled up his sleeve for a moment he
held a match beneath a handleless tea-
spoon a quick movement a flash of
metal a stabbing steel needle in pitted
flesh back went the coat he walked
toward the woman with quicker firmer
strides he patted her back jerked her
to him again in passionate embrace ill
take care of tony he said as he went
out he kicked the still body of the un-
conscious man

hpony bulotti the bodyguard
disliked having anyone behind him
art preceded him up the rickety stairs
but stood aside to draw back the burlap
curtain tony went in saw the disheveled
blonde the marks of the beating still
on her

 somebody work you over he
grinned black eyes swiftly swept the
room overlooked the body and flashed
back to the sobbing blonde

  cinch she moaned he beat me
up

  tony was admiring the blondes allur-
ing curves his eyes held interest

  aw he always gets tough when hes
drunk keed where is he

  art said tony tony turned
stared quit grinning and stuck his hands
over his head his brows were up be-
hind the bed tony arts voice was
thin

  tony went around the bed slowly kept
his hands aloft while he looked down
at his boss the biggest gamboleer the
east coast ever saw

  so you bumped him you a damned
cokey thats rich but id hate to be
you kid id hate to be you

  sit down tony the blonde

  tony sat down kept his hands in the
air until art took his gun his little black
eyes glared at the driver

  look tony she laid the bosss
money stack after stack of yellow-
backed currency on the bed without any
further words

  tony said well

  about twenty grand apieee tony
want in lets split it and scram

  and leave him here

  art said hell no are we foolish
thats what we need with you to help
us walk him out of here like he was
drunk

  tony thought a few moments i dont


spicy-adventure stories

believe i want any part of it his voice
was silky

  then take it here rat art raised
the gun but the blonde was between
them

  no art lay off listen tony-

  she sat on the arm of the rickety
rocker her breasts almost touched
tonys swarthy cheek she talked per-
suasively with her head turned from art
he couldnt see the things she was prom-
ising tony with her eyes tony weak-
ened

  suppose we do get him out how
much start would we have he came
up here to meet somebody and they
havent showed yet maybe well run into
them

  the blonde said please tony with
her too-red lips and a thousand other
words with her eyes

  tony said okay ill wait down-
stairs holler when youre ready

  he went out art kept his gun but
he knew damn well tony had another
stashed in the car

t turriedly they got the uncon-
scious qnch on his feet got coat
and vest socks shoes on him the cut
on his back bled through his shirt his
vest covered it art grinned and tied
a necktie about his scrawny neck when
he used a wet towel to wipe the blood
away from the split scalp cinch stirred
showed signs of coming to

  ive been wanting to do this for a
long time giggled art and hit him on
the temple with the butt of his gun
cinch didnt come to

  they got him downstairs art on one
side tony on the other the blonde
bringing up the rear her overnight bag
in her hand she paused to speak to the
tobacco-chewing ancient who owned the
place

  mr dolans kind of drunk and wants
to take a ride he was meeting a party
here so if they show up tell em well
be right back

  the old man nodded the four of
them went out

  they stuffed cinch bogan in the front
seat of the car stepped back art looked
at tony

  you drive said art gesturing

  let you sit behind me nuts
to hell with it said velma ill
drive myself

  they rolled away through the mud
while the road gradually dissolved into
bumpy ruts cinch kept bouncing against
the woman who drove she cursed each
time she shoved him back tony and art
sat stiffly in opposite corners of the
back seat

  down into the valley up the opposite
side of the mountain through a wooded
area around the shelter of a natural
rock wall the car stopped to their
right a sloping descent of some sixty
feet sparsely wooded at the foot of
the slope the holly river swollen with
the spring fill from early rains

  get out said art

get out yourself rat said tony
they got out opposite sides of the car
tony said this is kinda foolish
lets just toss him out in the weeds and
scram

  velma said lets do it right we
can tear our clothes daub on a little mud
and tell the hicks we managed to jump
she tugged cinch over beneath the
wheel of the big car sat his fifty dollar
hat on his head at a college boy angle
and said so long heel

  tony pushed on the left side art on
the right velma stepped aside as the
car began to roll she hit tony behind
the ear with arts blackjack the car
stopped
mountaineers are tough



   art said swell baby and came
 around to pick tony from the mud he
 threw the little gunman into the back
 seat together he and velma pushed
 the car to the brink gave it a farewell
 shove

   it careened wildly down the slope
 banged through bushes crashed over sap-
 lings hit the water with a tremendous
 splash art grinned

   well kid lets walk on back these
 hicks wont suspect anything well tell
 em we got out to pick daisies 

   the blonde grinned and picked up the
 bag

 otp in the name of the lord
 a reedy voice behind them art
 reached for his holster-too late

  two men stepped from the bushes
 both with rifles the first held his in
 the crook of his arm the second pointed
 his at arts stomach the speaker was
 tall and gaunt at least six and a half
 feet tall as gaunt a a skeleton his

you wont have to kill
him she said i already
have


spicy-adventure stories

leather-like face was almost covered by
a heavy thick beard his eyes were
beady fiery and black beneath beetling
brows

  jezebel he spat at the open-
mouthed blonde are you a harlot that
you paint your cheeks and daub your
mouth do you know the kingdom is
at hand

  velma giggled and said hi pop
art relaxed a little glanced at the
river where the car had disappeared
whats on your mind old man tell
that monkey to take the gun off me he
might hurt somebody

  the man with the leveled gun was the
exact counterpart of the speaker except
that his scraggly beard was red the
speakers interspersed with grey his
eyes were just as beady just as fiery
just as mad as those of the older man

  bring em lafe muttered the old
man and turned away

  lafe waved the rifle he said git
and spat into the mud at arts feet

  art said now wait a minute pop
are you the sheriff

  the old man turned drew his skinny
shoulders erect his eyes seemed to
smoulder then flame with new vicious-
ness i am jethro suggs the avenger
of jehovah i am the sword that slays
the steel that slaughters

  he turned walked back toward the
bushes lafe said git and cocked the
  n art shrugged looked a little blank
v elma giggled nervously and picked up
the bag

  lets go she said the damned
fool might fire that blunderbuss

two hours later they still walked the
old man in the lead art and velma
in the middle the younger man bringing
up the rear rifle alert to any sugges-
tion that they stop any protest of weari-

ness the young man had one word it
was git

  once velma lost a slipper in the suck-
ing mud she stopped art stopped the
mountaineer prodded him with the bar-
rel of his gun art wheeled with an
oath went into a half crouch and jerked
at his shoulder the younger suggs
calmly hit him on the head with his rifle
art groaned and rolled over beneath the
prodding brogan old jethro leaned over
him extracted the ugly little automatic
and threw it contemptuously into the
bushes lafe prodded art to his feet
the procession went on

  the house was a rambling log shanty
spread and sprawling in a muddy de-
pression a tumble-down lean-to served
as a barn for a skinny mule a rusty
plow lay in the front yard a few ragged
chickens scratching about it as the four
people approached a razorback hog
squealed viciously and ran around the
corner of the house pursued by a yap-
ping hound puppy

  another hound trotted dejectedly to
meet them sniffed inquiringly at the city
pair and slunk off whining when lafe
delivered a well placed kick

  a barefoot woman met them at the
door she wore a single faded calico
garment rent and torn to reveal splotchy
skin beneath her breasts bulged flab-
bily her thighs were enormous hams
her eyes held a blank vacuous stare
while the spread slot of her open mouth
was expressionless disclosing yellow
snuff-stained teeth she moved aside her
eyes fixed curiously on velma and art

  the old man jethro stood silently in
the doorway velma set the bag down
carefully sat down herself on a pun-
cheon chair art shifted nervously the
old man said keep em in there to
the woman and disappeared after hand-
ing her his rifle she grinned into the
mountaineers are tough



room the stupid drooling grin of a
feeble-minded child art shuddered his
hands trembled as he lighted a cigarette
his voice was a snarl in answer to
velmas question

  naw i dont think they saw us push
the car over i dont give a damn if
they did well get away from here
somehow damn crazy hicks

  the girl in the doorway giggled

  scram snarled art his lips curled
back beat it you look like hell he
made a motion as if to advance

  she raised the gun muzzle giggled
again and said doncha do it mister
ill shoot ya

  art stopped then desperate in his
need oblivious of who might see he
retreated to a chimney comer pulled up
his sleeve the flare of a match

  velma sat disconsolate worn out
shoulders hunched wearily her eyes
shrewd returning bright-eyed from the
chimney corner art slapped her on the
back

  buck up kid he smiled til get
us out of here as soon as grampa gets
back

  but the girl was wary art she
said i think the whole outfit is crazy
well have to take it easy or theyll get
wise to this she prodded the handbag
with her toe if they knew how much
money was in there theyd kill us

  art nodded started to reply

  haw haw i

  art stiffened the girl glanced about
anxiously a dark hulk straightened
erect in a dim corner took a wavering
step toward the pair velma screamed
threw her arms about art in unreason-
ing fright arts own eyes bulged

rfthe man or beast advancing toward
them towered at least two feet higher
than art his shoulders were in propor-

tion bare feet protruding from frayed
homespuns were spadelike one great
arm with a ham-like hand was extended
toward them the other sleeve was tied
in a knot the creature had one arm
only

  but it was his head that provoked fear
and nausea it was as colorless and as
hairless as a billiard ball enormous sick-
ening in its resemblance to soft putty
no brows no lashes above the red-
rimmed sunken little eyes that blinked so
uncertainly in the dim light his nose
was a bulbous mass above the slathering
slot that was his mouth

 he laughed again haw haw
haw diseased eyes feasting on the
soft figure of the blonde at arms length
he paused his eyes burning a purple
tongue slid gruesomely from his lipless
mouth to lick at the drooling spittle he
reached out his single arm grasped
velma by the shoulder and whirled her
across the room she crashed against the
wall fell in a sprawling heap in a flurry
of chiffon her dress crumpling thigh-
high hand still extended mouth drool-
ing and muttering the idiot started over
toward her

  art frozen until now seized the pun-
cheon chair crashed it down across the
giants head and shoulders the man
never tottered never swayed he turned
and looked at art blinking a little fool-
ishly again haw haw haw again
a darting tongue again a ham-like hand
fingers closed in the front of arts shirt
he was lifted bodily hurled through the
air he crashed over a bench fell against
the log wall and lay still

  the giant turned back to the uncon-
scious girl for a long while he leaned
over her eyes feasting on the white
roundness of her exposed legs licking
his lips at the sight of stridently rising
continued on page 
a thin sword of shadow swung
like a pendulum in the blue peru-
vian moonlight crossed the bars
of bob newtons tiny cell window
newton sprang from his cot leaped up
caught at the windows high bars he
hung there waiting watching for that
shadow

  shes alive she must be alive they
cant have  murdered ellen he
muttered through clenched teeth

  a sandy mop of hair dropped down
over his tanned lean face with a steel-
hard grip he clung to the windows bars
his feet dangling almost a yard above
the cells stone floor his shoulders
ached with the effort of supporting his
tall muscular frame

  again the shadow passed his win-
dow but it was more than a shadow
it was a narrow ribbon of fragile silk
hanging down from the floor above

  bob newton tensed there was a spill


of paper tied to the end of the dangling
ribbon
the secret of the remains of the
dead conquistador will bring

whip her or-

until she whips

  he thrust out one hard brown hand
clutched missed then he tried again
this time he succeeded he drew the
scrap of paper through the bars of the


spicy-adventure stories

window unfastened it tying the dan-
gling ribbon to a window-bar he drop-
ped to the floor and opened the paper

   in the brilliant moonlight he read the
message

 bob-

    if its you beneath come for me
  before it is too late i

                                  ellen

  a wave of relief and hope flooded
through bob newtons soul ellen-
his ellen-was alive they had not
harmed her  yet

  desperately he ran his hands through
his pockets he must send her a reply
but he had nothing with which to write
yesterday morenos cutthroats had
stolen everything when they had kid-
naped newton and ellen on the callao
waterfront 

tthen an idea came to him carefully
he tore the note until he had three
words they were bob and the pair
it is his message was it is bob
he leaped back to the cell window
with them tied the scraps to the dang-
ling ribbon he jerked the ribbon
lightly jubilantly he saw the ribbon
being pulled upward

  he dropped back to the floor of the
cell stared about him he must break
out-gain his freedom-rescue ellen
but how he was caged imprisoned
helpless the dungeons only exit was
a narrow heavy door in sudden red
fury newton hurled himself at the
wooden portal crashed his two hundred
pounds of bone and sinew against it

   amazingly it burst open spilling him
out upon the floor of the pitch-dark hall-
way outside the cell dazed bewildered
bob newton scrambled to his feet and

stood there for a brief moment un-
steadily he shook his head he was
out-free he was free  and ellen
was on the floor just above in this
strange house that had its cellar divided
off into cells

  stealthily he crept down the hall he
found a narrow staircase hesitated
everything was strangely ominously
quiet there was an atmosphere of dan-
ger all-pervading and intense in the
darkness newton still could not under-
stand how his cell-door had come to be
unbarred and ellen    

  up the stairs he went swiftly noise-
lessly  gained the floor above he was
in another hallway now and still he had
encountered no sign of his abductors
yesterday it had taken a half-dozen men
to bring him here perhaps they were
all gone-

  he counted the doors on this floor
found the room directly over the cell in
which he had been imprisoned he tried
the knob

  the door was unlocked slowly
quietly he pushed inward and then he
was inside the chamber he heard a
faint sound in the solid darkness crept
toward it

tte stumbled against a cot put out
his hands his fingers encountered
soft warmly-pliant flesh  a girls
flesh  a womans naked shoulder

  ellen bob newton whispered
something caught in his throat was she
unconscious  had they hurt her 
ellen he breathed again harshly in
the blackness his hands groped for the
warm loveliness of her unseen body
tingling thrills raced through his veins
as he pulled her close never before had
he been so near to ellen lanhart his
fiancee her natural modesty and reserve
i

the boneg of pizarro



had forbidden any situation as intimate
as that which danger now forced on
them    she wore nothing now but a
brief tissue-thin wisp of underthings   

  ellen-my dearest dear newton
whispered for the third time desperately

  the girl moved stirred uneasily
bob she moaned

  ellen-waken he panted weve
got to get out of this place-quickly
he bent over her slipped an arm under
the lovely sweetness of her waist lifted
her then some impelling attraction
forced him to draw her toward him
crush her against his chest

  her usual reserve had vanished he
heard her sigh felt her breath against his
cheek   she quivered against him and
her arms drifted about his neck bob-
darling f she whispered we cannot
leave here until you have told them the
secret they want to know her voice
sounded oddly thick and accented

  secret

  yes i the secret of pizarros bones
her whisper held a sharp vibrant quality
to bob newtons nostrils came a faint
suggestion of perfume it was strange
because ellen never used perfume-

  pizarros bones newton repeated
wonderingly and then suddenly he
remembered the reason for his abduc-
tion and imprisonment was abruptly
clear to him and he cursed the blind
chance that had brought him and ellen
here to callao on a pre-nuptial round-
the-world tour   

dizarros bones bob newton re-
called the legend which had existed
in his family for three generations it
was a legend handed down by bob new-
tons grandfather who once had been an
archaelogical explorer in peru in cuz-
co the story dealt with the fabled bones
of francisco pizarro spanish conquis-

tador e who had subdued peru centuries
ago

  there was a mummy on exhibit at the
cathedral in lima-a mummy reputed to
be pizarros body but most historians
agreed that the mummy was a fake that
it was not the mortal remains of the real
pizarro-

  pizarros bones according to the leg-
end were hidden in some other place
a secret crypt and bob newtons
grandfather was supposed to have stum-
bled upon that fabled tomb to have dis-
covered the last resting-place of the true
francisco pizarro

  during the older newtons lifetime he
had never revealed to his family the ex-
act location of his discovery the
knowledge will come in due time and it
will bring bloodshed in its wake     
the old man had often mumbled

  and now bob newton realized the
truth his captor moreno must have
discovered in some way that bob new-
ton was the grandson of the older new-
ton the man who had found pizarros
secret tomb and moreno thought that
bob newton knew the secret moreno
wanted to learn the tombs location so
that he could exhume pizarros mummi-
fied body for exhibition purposes  it
would mean a fortune for moreno

  bob newton fingered the huge old-
fashioned signet-ring on the third finger
of his right hand the ring his grand-
father had willed to him he held the
girl closer to him i cant tell moreno
where pizarros tomb is located he
whispered

  why not she asked sharply

  because i dont know my grand-
father never told me

  you lie senor bob newton the
girl said suddenly viciously and as she
spoke bob newton stiffened and a


spicy-adventure stories

great amazement filled him this girl in
his arms-with her accented voice her
exotic perfume-she was not ellen lan-
hartl

  even as he realized it lights flashed
on in the room newton dropped the
girl she fell back toward the cot he
stared at her

  she was spanish-a brunette and
ellen was blonde

  who are you bob newton rasped
out suddenly

  the strange girls hand darted under
her pillow emerged with a flat automa-
tic she smiled mirthlessly cruelly
you are right senor newton i am
not ellen i am conchita moreno sister
of the man who abducted you and your
sweetheart

  bob newtons widened eyes saw a
trailing ribbon which ran zig-zag across
the floor to the shuttered window you
-you sent me that note he accused
his face went slowly pale

  si i sent you that note it was a
trick to bring you up here i thought to
dupe you into mistaking me for your
fiancee in the darkness i planned to
make you tell me the location of pizar-
ros tomb

  you failed bob newton said slow-
ly his hard jaw jutted forward and
now that youve failed-where is ellen
lanhart what have you done to her
his voice rose vengefully savagely

  the dark-haired girl shrugged her
swollen white breasts undulated with the
movement of her smooth shoulders
senorita lanhart is with my brother
rico moreno he will entertain her
very well she sneered

a t morenos name bob newtons face
hardened rico moreno-the peru-
vian whom he had befriended a year ago
back in the states  and who had re-

paid the friendship by kidnaping newton
and ellen lanhart here in callao with
a snarled oath bob newton whirled
toward the rooms door-

  stop conchita moreno called
sharply she leaped to her feet leveled
her automatic squeezed the weapons
trigger

  the gun barked and a singing slug
whined past newtons head epanged
into the wall before him he froze
turned slowly to face the spanish girl

  he sucked in his breath and unwill-
ing admiration dawned in his angry
eyes in the subdued light of the rooms
single electric lamp she was beautiful
with a feline pantherish beauty as she
stood there legs spread wide automatic
held waist-high raven coils of hair
tumbled about her pearly naked shoul-
ders despite an air of hardness about
her lithe slim figure she was utterly
feminine her dark eyes were narrowed
cat-like glowing   

   the next bullet will not miss senor
newton the girl spoke evenly

  you wouldnt dare bob newton
flung at her

  her dark brows rose no try me
and see she challenged

  he read the purpose in her narrowed
feline eyes he knew that she would
shoot him without fear and without
compunction if he attempted escape
and then he thought of ellen his lovely
yellow-haired fiancee 

  ellen was somewhere in this house
was in rico morenos clutches abrupt-
ly bob newton knew that he must tread
carefully that it would require all his
guile all his cunning to get to ellen and
save her from  death or worse

   he forced a slow smile to his lips i
believe youd actually shoot me be
whispered

 i would indeed senor bob new-
ton

  his eyes went to her generous breasts
took in the wide arches of her hips the
cream-smooth ivory-white contours of
her legs her thighs    then once
more he met her eyes with his own its
hard to believe that one so beautiful
could be so hard he said

potent than that automatic bob new-
ton insinuated

meaning- she purred her dark
eyes narrowing once more

 meaning that a bullet wouldnt make
 me tell you the secret you want to know
 but you might learn it through other
 means he said boldly audaciously

she stared at him a new compre-

   she laughed shortly i shall not be
 fooled by your flattery your tongue is
 smooth-but not smooth enough

   you think pm flattering you when i
say that you are beautiful  he asked her
gently

   she shrugged with her left hand
she patted lightly the curves of her hip
i know that i am beautiful i do not
need you to tell me so

   your loveliness is a weapon far more

hending light dawned in her gaze she
grinned faintly then you do know the
resting-place of pizarros mummy
maybe bob newtons heart leaped
a little but he strove to maintain the
expressionlessness of his tanned features
he had a plan-a desperate plan if he
could trick this dark-haired girl into ac-
cepting his kisses his caresses  he
might wrest that automatic from her  

  she looked at him and you would
tell me the secret if i permitted you to
make love to me

  how could i resist

   she lowered the automatic kiss me
she commanded

tte went toward her gathered her
into his arms he kissed her-and
she responded with all the sultriness of
her latin nature despite himself bob
newton felt a tingling electrical sensa-
tion of desire lancing through his veins

  this girl was a smouldering volcano
of feminine passion-passion that leaped
from her parted lips to his and from her
body to his body he felt her quivering
against him 

   he pressed her close kissed her shoul-
ders her throat she clung to him
caught a sharp breath as his lips moved
over her throat she was like a vibrant
flame that set fire to his soul-with a
fire that charred his senses seared his
consciousness he held her still for a
moment felt the little shudder that sud-
denly possessed her  he lifted her
in his arms

  and then abruptly from somewhere
behind him bob newton heard a smoth-
ered gasping sob-a womans bitter cry
of hurt and disillusionment it was the
voice of his fiancee ellen lanhart-
and then a door slammed 
in a flooding receding rush desire
departed from bob newtons veins was

replaced by disgust dismay disgust
with himself and with the blackhaired
conchita moreno whom he held in his
arms dismay that ellen lanhart should
have seen him in such a position

tvtow he remembered that he had be-
gun making love to the spanish girl
for a certain definite purpose  and
he realized that he had permitted that
purpose to be sidetracked by sheer in-
voluntary desire     

  like a flash he leaped to his feet
at the same instant his hand darted for-
ward seized the automatic from the bru-
nettes grasp

  you damned slut he rasped
leveling the weapon he backed away
from the girl toward the closed door
of the room ellen lanhart had been at
that door an instant before and now
bob newton would follow her find her
rescue her  tell her the meaning of
the scene she had inadvertently wit-
nessed 

  conchita moreno sprang to her feet
with a lithe bound she reached the door
first her fingers found the key
flipped it in the lock then before new-
ton could stay her she dashed for the
window pulled aside the drapery flung
the key out into the moon-drenched
night

  damn you to everlasting hell new-
ton snarled he sprang at the girl

  she fought him with tooth and claw
he felt her sharp nails raking diagonal-
ly downward across his cheek with an
oath he slapped her with his open palm
full across the mouth with all his rage-
born strength she cried out staggered
backward newton hurled himself upon
her bore her backward to the floor

  his anger built up by frustration
could be neither controlled nor checked
the bones of pizarro

he pinioned her reached at the win-
dows heavy drapes tore at them

  with a muffled crash the velvet cur-
tains came down bringing the drapery-
pole with them swiftly bob newton
yanked at the curtains pulled away their
long tasseled cords with the cords he
bound conchita moreno-trussed her
hand and foot he stuffed his hanker-
chief into her open mouth gagging her

  her eyes glared up at him twin pools
of venomous hate but newton knew
no remorse for the way he had man-
handled her cursing he leaped at the
window swung himself outward in the
baleful glare of the moon he dropped

  he must find that key-get back into
conchita morenos room-unlock her
door-and then commence a frantic
search for the yellow-haired ellen lan-
hart  desperately he went to hands and
knees on the ground seeking the key
which the spanish girl had tossed
through the window

  to the left below the hill on which the
house stood the pacific was a broad
gleaming jewel in the moonlight and on
the open harbor of callao among that
welter of anchored ships was the steam-
er spardian which had brought bob
newton and ellen lanhart here

  in the opposite direction the fertile
valley of the rimac widened toward the
distant spires of lima limned against
the purple range which ran inward to
meet the mighty andes 

prantically bob newton
searched for the key and then sud-
denly he went cold something round
and hard and metallic was boring into
his back-

  a guns muzzle

  get up senor newton and no
tricks a sibilant whisper came to bob
newtons straining ears

  the american straightened turned-
and stared into the glittering eyes of
rico moreno the man who had abduct-
ed him

  you peruvian rat newton rasped
his muscles tightened tautened

  one false move and you are a very
dead americano moreno spoke silkily
come back into the house since my
sweet sisters plan failed to elicit from
you the information i desire we will try
a different scheme

  for an instant newton toyed with
the idea of chancing combat with the
spaniard of hurling himself at the man
knocking aside his revolver smashing his
fist home against morenos jaw but
that would be foolhardy  and be-
sides there was ellen somewhere within
the house she must be saved newton
dared not risk a bullet through his
belly just now not until ellen was out
of danger

  moreno was leading him into the
house now was prodding him up the
corridor toward an open door they
entered a room

  it was conchita morenos room evi-
dently there had been a duplicate key
for the door was now unlocked and
open conchita herself was unbound un-
gagged and now a tight-fitting silken
dress covered her voluptuous body

  rico moreno spoke listen sefior
newton he rasped you are going
to tell me the location of francisco pi-
zarros tomb-do you understand

  how can i tell you something i do
not know bob newton grunted

  ah but you do know moreno
said you admitted as much to my
sweet sister here i overheard you that
was when i brought your lovely golden-
haired fiancee to the door of this room
and permitted her to see you making love
to conchita


spicy-adventure stories

  why did you do that newton asked
harshly

  i thought to destroy her faith in you
senor i thought perhaps she too knew
the secret-and if she believed you to be
unfaithful to her she might decide to
loosen her tongue unfortunately your
fiancee could tell me nothing

  and neither can i newton retort-
ed

  rico morenos dark brows went up
swiftly no but perhaps there may
be a way of unlocking that stubborn
mouth of yours he raised his voice
fernando-felipe bring the yellow-
haired girl here he called loudly

  bob newton tensed and then a
moment later two saddle-colored peru-
vian natives entered the room hauling
between them the struggling form of
ellen lanhart

  lovely she was with a slim entranc-
ing youthfulness her blonde wavy
hair her fair shoulders the seductive
lines of her tiny breasts beneath her linen
dress the winsome contours of her
slender hips and delicately-tapered legs
all combined to make a picture of naive
deliciousness when bob newton saw
her his heart gave a great bound

  ellen-my dear he gasped hoarse-
ly

  she looked at him and a dim con-
tempt came into her starry blue eyes
her red kissable lips were tremulous as
she turned her gaze away from new-
ton 

  it was more than he could bear he
whirled on moreno damn you he
rasped youve made her think that i
- his fist smashed at the peruvians
jaw

jltoreno staggered almost went
down under the exploding impact
of newtons savage blow and then

morenos two henchmen leaped at bob
newton bludgeoned him with the butts
of their automatics hammered him down
under the force of their battering attack
raging pain made a niagara of agony
through newtons brain he sagged into
stupefied semi-consciousness   

  water he dimly heard morenos
rasping command

  and then one of morenos henchmen
leaped from the room to return in a
moment with a bucket brim-full of cold
water moreno took it flung its con-
tents full into bob newtons blood-
smeared face

  d-dont  you b-beast ellens
voice rang out sharply and to bob
newton slowly reviving her attempt
at intercession was like a reprieve from
hell then she still loved him-didnt
want him to be tortured

  but even as he opened his eyes mo-
reno had whirled on the golden-haired
girl you keep your mouth shut the
peruvian snarled and he dashed the
remainder of the water on ellen lan-
harts shrinking body

  it soaked her thin dress and where
the garment clung to her lovely body
wet and tight it revealed more than ever
the sweet outlines of her young breasts
like a second skin the wet material
limned every seductive curve every en-
ticing line two alluring mounds of girl-
flesh pressed outward through the wet
dress until they appeared so clear in de-
tail as if they were bared 

  bob newton groaned staggered to his
feet rage made a red haze of hatred
before his eyes he tried to fling him-
self at rico moreno

  but the peruvians two native hench-
men were upon him pinioning him so
that he could not move helpless in the
grasp of his captors bob newton stared
foggily at the scene before him
the bones of pizarro



stop yelled the span-
ish girl she leaped to her
feet squeezed the trigger
of the automatic   

  rico moreno held ellen in his hard
arms the man was leering wickedly
he turned his hard eyes on newton
now sefior gringo he barked you
are helpless and i have your sweetheart
here as my prisoner will you tell me
what i want to know will you reveal
the secret hiding-place of pizarros
bones 

  ive already told you i dont know

newton panted thickly

 you are a stubborn jackass my
friend but perhaps i know a way to
cure that stubbornness with that mo-
renos claw-like hands went to the neck
of ellen lanharts frock he ripped
downward savagely-


spicy-adventure stories

jpllen cried out tried to struggle
away from her captor but it was
useless moreno was ripping tearing at
her dress until at last he had snatched
all but tattered remnants from her lovely
form now she stood there completely
unclad save for brief silken panties   
she tried to turn away tried to cover
her naked breasts with her fluttering
palms 

  wide-eyed with rage livid with a
consuming hate bob newton felt a surg-
ing and consuming fury welling up in his
throat moreno had defiled ellen lan-
hart-the girl newton loved and for
that moreno would pay the american
swore silently

  rico moreno once more pulled ellen
toward him enfolded her half-nude
body in his arms he locked her in a
rough and savage embrace    he
kissed her despite her agonized strug-
gles to free herself from his brutal arms
-his seeking hands    then he turned
to bob newton will you tell me the
secret gringo dog or must i  go
further     

  sweat stood out on newtons strained
forehead desperately vainly he at-
tempted to release himself from the two
natives who held him i tell you i
dont know where pizarros bones are
buried he cried hoarsely insanely

  still stubborn eh morenos eyes
narrowed he barked a command to his
henchmen rope the americano to the
wall

  newton felt his wrists being bound
with a length of rawhide his arms
were jerked over his head fastened to a
huge spike which protruded from the
wall he swayed against his fetters

  moreno turned to the cringing ellen
lanhart his hand dropped to his wide
leather belt unfastened a many-thonged
quirt he handed the whip to the yellow-

haired girl here he barked take
this and whip your lover until he is ready
to tell me what i wish to know

  ellens eyes widened in horror you
-you want me to whip bob newton
si

  i wont do it

lyforeno turned to his sister the
dark-haired conchita take a
whip from one of my men then whip
this girl until she in turn whips her
sweetheart

  conchitas cat-like eyes lighted up
sadistically with the greatest of de-
light my brother she grinned readily
she snatched a thick-handled rawhide
quirt from the belt of one of morenos
underlings she hefted the lash swung
it deftly viciously-

  the long snaky thong curled out and
cut sharply across the snowy flawless
whiteness of ellen lanharts back 

  ellen screamed again conchita
moreno raised her quirt brought it sing-
ing down across ellens rounded hips
and ellen moaned with agonized pain-
ellen-for gods sake do as youve
been ordered bob newton gasped out
desperately go ahead and lash me

  i-i cant even though i saw you
in this other girls arms i-i still love
you  ellen sobbed

  i made love to her in order to get
her automatic newton grated and
now for the love of god-lash me
ellen hesitated once more conchitas
quirt descended upon the yellow-haired
girls naked back and then because
she had no other course ellen raised her
own whip brought it down across the
chest of her sweetheart bob newton

  and as conchitas stinging whip-blows
bit into ellens cringing white flesh
ellen in turn increased the tempo of her
own lashes at newtons squirming body
the bones of pizarro



  newton closed his eyes to the pain
ellens quirt was cutting through his
shirt biting into his flesh    but he
knew that this torture was not really
meant for him rico moreno had an-
other purpose now the man was a
fiend a sadistic monster a flagellant   

  like some modern caligula the peru-
vian was gloating over the scene now
being enacted before his narrowed eyes
slash-slash-slash-the whips descend-
ed upon bob newton and upon the
agonized ellen lanhart-

  newtons shirt was ripped and slashed
to ribbons now and his flesh was raw
bleeding ellen lanharts unwilling and
inexperienced hand could not control
her whip and every blow she dealt him
was like a razor-cut whereas conchita
moreno more adept was careful not to
draw blood from ellens lovely white
body

  conchitas slashing quirt was a thing
of finesse of exquisite and graduated
cruelty that raised angry red weals on
ellens back but drew no crimson 

  bob newton gritted his teeth under
the double torture of being whipped and
seeing his beloved ellen similarly lashed
and then abruptly hope leaped into his
heart the rope which bound him to
that overhead spike in the wall seemed
to be loosening

  he pretended to sag semi-conscious
and he threw his full weight against the
rawhide thong it slipped stretched-

  and he almost slipped his hands from
the noose

 t the same instant ellen saw what
he was doing like a flash she
pivoted-and her next quirt-blow in-
stead of lashing down on newton sang
through the air and sliced full across
conchita morenos face

  conchita screamed a harsh agonized

cry blood dripped from her mutilated
cheek she dropped her whip staggered
backward    and simultaneously
bob newton launched himself headlong
at rico moreno conchitas brother

  moreno was totally unprepared for the
attack he went sprawling punched up
against the far wall and as he fell
newton leaped after him flicked the
peruvians automatic from the mans
broad leather belt newton whirled

  morenos two henchmen were closing
in bob newtons finger tightened on
the automatics trigger he squeezed
hot lead out of the weapons flame-
belching muzzle and the two natives
went tumbling down to some peruvian
hell with bullets through their skulls

  but in that brief instant rico moreno
had regained his feet now he hurled
himself upon bob newton from behind
and the american went down with mo-
reno on top of him desperately newton
squirmed over on his back so that he
was face to face with the savage-eyed
moreno who pinioned him

  moreno was battering at the amer-
icans face was snatching at the auto-
matic in newtons right fist newton
strove to bring the guns muzzle upward
to blow a hole through morenos guts
but suddenly the peruvian plunged his
knee into bob newtons groin and as
the nauseating agony ate like a cancer
through the americans abdomen mo-
reno got the automatic

  he got it raised it aimed it-

  with the last ounce of his strength
bob newton smashed upward with his
fist knocking the automatic aside even as
it spat flame and belched leaden death
the bullet whined across the room new-
ton heard a sudden wailing feminine cry
-and the thud of a slumping body

cold horror gripped at the americans

hot sun blistered the sandhills
and shimmered the faded green
across the mesquite flats tex
qaydons green eyes were on the chapar-

the little clearing was a welcome sight

the indolent way then was gone
from him and his horse leaped ahead at

the bite of spurs a womans high-
pitched scream rang shrill into the heated
quietude and then she was in the door-
way of the hut

  a mexican girl not more than sixteen
much prettier than most tex claydon
thought-and he had an eye for them

mg dandng and making love this tall
flat-bodied texican had few equals from
chihuahua to calgary

  he smiled as the girl pawed at the
door-casing another mex family quar-
rel he thought-and hombre how they
could quarrel he started to ease his
horses gait and then went swiftly for-
ward again a huge pair of hands
hairy muscled came over the girls
shoulders and held her one hand came
down seized the front of the cheap
gingham dress and jerked it tearing it

  the upper hemispheres of small firm
brown breasts quivered into view below
through the thin material he could en-
vision a flat olive-tinted stomach slen-
der appealing hips and the slender
rounded limbs of latin youth

  tex because of the sunlight outside
the gloom beyond the doorway could
see nothing of the mans face he heard
him laugh and the laugh was one tex
never could have liked the girl was
picked up dragged inside her screams
gave way to pitiful moans and a low
frantic pleading

hpex left his horse in the rim of the
mesquite and went quickly to the
hut he closed his eyes a moment so
he would not be blinded when he stepped
into the gloom then cat-like he was
inside the place and a long stride car-
ried him across the little room

  the man was bending above the girl
pressing her against a bunk built against
the wall she pleaded in a low voice and
writhed from side to side her slender
legs kicked wildly the mans huge right
hand grabbed for them

  tex leaned and smacked down the
hand grabbed the jumper collar and
jerked the other to his feet and slammed
him back against the wall until then
he did not realize how big the attacker

really was a red one he red-haired
red-whiskered red-eyed with the reek
of tequila to his breath

  surprise held him momentarily and
then his hands dropped swiftly to the
butts of twin guns tied down and hol-
stered low tex claydon leaped smashed
rights and lefts to his whiskered face
hooked a heel behind his knees and
jerked him down the sharp toes of his
boots kicked the half-drawn guns across
the hut

   soundlessly then they went into it
while the girl kneeling by the bunk
stared with fear-filled large eyes sur-
prise the swift attack of tex claydon
gave him the upper hand otherwise
he doubted he ever could have handled
this other man he set to work then a
side-glance at the girl spurring him on

  now he began taunting the other
your left eye now aint you man to
take it big booger now at lily-bulk
beak    his blows landed the red
one staggered blindly both eyes clos-
ing his lips crushed blood running down
his chin tex spun him aimed him at
the door kicked mightily the other
sailed outside and landed on his face

  you-you got me dirty he bawled
wabbling to his feet well meet agin
an when we do ill-

  youll get a brisket full of colt
medicine tex snarled get huddem
you hightail yonderly 

   he turned back inside

  a rush and warm brown arms were
around his neck for a moment he
picked the girl clear of the floor and
her soft lips were frantic on his own
she squirmed her soft body against him
and made crooning panting little sounds

  fire ran from texs toes through his
body and surged hot in his face but
even if she was mex she was still a
pistoleers paradise



kid he put her down thrusting her
back

  the so brave americano not like
the gringo peeg from which you leetle
doncia haff save the girl cried eet
ees i would reward you ees niiiice re-
ward no

  she pirouetted before him her breasts
quivering her legs vibrating as she
twisted this way and that

  too nice tex mumbled but you
dont know what you are sayin kid
noooo doncia ver ver-what you
speak-caliente ma-ma for you i haff
dream-

  go back to sleep then tex clay-
don growled an see if you cant dream
some more cool off

  he left her then she was calling
after him and then she was screaming
insults and calling him a dumb gringo

  mebbe im dumb tex grunted as
he took up the trail again but theys
some kinds of pepper ats too hot for
even me

  anyhow i bet at red-whiskers dont
do much horsin or ridin for a few days
nohow

  he knew the red-whiskered one was
dangerous a killer he yawned turning
where the trail forked his destination
for no real reason save the itch to roam
was the blue-haze line of the footstool
range far to his right

thwo days later in late afternoon tex
claydon rode into the light timber
of the lower footstool range he fol-
lowed a tiny seep of water and came
finally to a little artifical lake that lay
at the head of it a spring broke out of
the dry hills and the ravine below it had
been dammed with earth and stones a
few willow trees offered shade along the
bank tex followed a cattle trail up to

it dismounted and stood surveying the
ridged broken country all around

  he frowned then and walked to a
rock at the edge of the little lake still
frowning he stooped and when he
straightened he held clothing in his
hands a pair of riding pants a shirt
small boots-and dainty underthings that
caused a wide grin to crease his face
he looked swiftly this way and that

  a faint alluring perfume came from
the silken garment that wasnt half as
large as the neckerchief tex wore
chuckling he told himself like to
meet the lil lady in person-riiight now
bet shes hidin somewheres in these
gullies an rocks

  he raised his voice mam come on
out an meet me tex claydon or if
you aint willin ill leave your clothes
here an turn my back

  he waited but no answer came he
frowned again funny he thought there
was no sign of a horse around and there
was no dwelling no ranch house in miles
as far as he knew he placed the clothes
beneath a willow got his horse and
started riding a wide circle around the
little lake

  he reached a rise and paused off to
the east below this rise a horse broke
out of light timber a rider bent low
along its neck

  hell tex gasped a woman an
she aint wearin much moren a plucked
jaybird i didnt aim to scare her like
at

  he watched her ride enjoying the vi-
sion of white flesh on the saddle of dark
hair blowing in the wind of the full
white limbs that gripped the animals
sides for a moment he envied that
horse

  and then his admiration ceased a
man had come quirting and spurring out
of the timber after the girl the girl

looked back saw him swung in a circle
and came back toward the rise where
tex was occupied with his observation
she disappeared now into a ravine the
man circled this way and that

  it was a grim game of hounds and
hare and tex claydon decided to join
in he cut into a water-cut gulley and
came down toward the one where the
girl was hidden unseen by the man who
sought her

  i have the damest luck tex com-
plained an i never seen such a hors-
in bunch of wimmen chousers in my
born days aint they no men in these
parts at can make a gal want em-
without havin to ride their tails from
here to yonderly

tte rode down the ravine the girl
heard him she was urging her
horse the other way when tex came
around a turn and sighted her she
reined in then so quick her horse
reared high the party chasing her had
come into the ravine from the other end

  this is gonna be worth a lot he
bawled lashing his horse

  a lot of lead tex claydon snarled

  the riders mouth went agape as he
sighted the intruder he pawed at his
gun as he slid toward the off-side of his
horse

  tex claydons right arm moved in a
blur sunlight glinted on his pistol as
he sprang it free and upward and a
blossom of smoke burst into the air
the roar of the gun rang back and forth
in the canyon setting the girls horse
rearing and buck jumping

  the man beyond her let go his gun
and his saddlehorn and as his horse
sprang and ran rolled along the ground
there was a tiny hole just under his left
eye the rest of the story was told by

the back of his head it wasnt nice to
see

  tex jammed his gun into the holster
and spun his horse toward the girl he
grabbed the bit close to the horses
mouth and jerked it down

  it-its terribly hard to hold him
without boots or spurs or- she
blushed from head to foot-riding-
breeches

  frankly tex claydon looked at her
exertion and excitement caused her
breath to come fast and heavy her
breasts delicate and smooth as the
cheeks of a baby rocked with her
breath straining the thin bandeau that
cradled them

  tex let his eyes follow down the soft
contours of her body and noticed the
raw angry red of the tender white skin
of her legs skin roughed where she had
tried to clamp the saddle with her knees
his gaze fastened on her barely covered
hips and thighs

  the girls head flung high in a proud
imperious gesture tex tore his eyes
away from the bruises around her kneer
and looked at the blushing delicate oval
of her face

  he shifted in the stirrups wiped his
forehead with his sleeve and his tongue
ran out to moisten dry lips

  your-er your legs is goin to be
sore mam unless you do somethin
quick he said hoarsely i got some
salve in my saddlebags-w h y lil
lady

che would have fallen from the sad-
die had he not caught her her eyes
were closed and she lay a soft alluring
delicious thing as he held her in his arms
he hugged her close as he led her horse
and started back for the lake his blood
beat faster as he held her dose he
leaned kissed her kissed ter again upon
pistoleers paradise



her closed eyelids the girl opened her
eyes then closed them quickly her lips
parted and she stirred restlessly nestled
closer to him

  he was glad when they got to the lake
and he could put her down on a little
patch of grass while he sought in his
saddlebags the girl opened one eye and
looked at him she seemed undecided
to pretend to remain in a faint or get

up the thought of him as he rode with
her in his arms caused her to quiver
she lay quiet

  she had never been drawn to any man
before she had been sufficient unto her-
self  proud commanding wishing to be
alone now as tex claydon kneeled
and began rubbing salve onto the raw
spots on the skin of her legs where the

saddle had chaffed she had to fight her-
self

  here was a man she had never seen
before whose nearness made her want
to scream wind her arms about him
pull him even closer even though she

knew his ministrations were impersonal
that he was only trying to alleviate her
pain her whole body tingled and her
pulse pounded maddeningly

  she could hardly resist opening her
eyes and throwing her arms about his
neck and giving into a mad kiss all the
ardor burning in her lips with a violent
effort she restrained herself lay still for
long stunned moments

  he was done then stumbling back
to his horse when he returned he
brought her clothes she sighed sat up
and reluctantly reached for them they
looked long into each others eyes he
said heavily do you-

  i dont know she panted -i
dont know what you mean

   he let it go at that

tthey came back to reality as she
dressed tex claydon had to look
away his nails bitting into his palms as
he clenched his fists they mounted and
the grimness of the thing returned to
them

  who was it i kilt tex inquired
he felt no remorse he was glad he had
gunned out that skunk

  a man she said darkly who rode
for sug horween his name is-was-
ace toltec id ridden over here to take
a swim i never thought theyd come
this far of the line laid down that
means that sug horween is ready to
come out in the open and ace toltec
being killed-oh it means the end
even sug horween cant be so bad
as to sanction what toltec was up to   
i reckon he come on you while you was
swimmin an run you out

  he did and horween-why hes
worse than his men he gave them
orders to chase me and to-to    well
he has been after me himself i got
away you see he wants the small

ranchers to make the first move and
knows that would bring it about

  how about your folks

  i have none i own a little place on
quirt creek and run it myself except
when its haying or branding time

  you need a man tex claydon com-
mented

  she didnt answer but inside herself
she wondered if she didnt-now that
she had been awakened to herself

  the trouble tex briefly inquired

  sug horween is the type the law lets
alone-and there is little enough law
here he owns most of the range in the
hills beyond quirt creek but isnt satis-
fied besides it isnt so easy to raid
bring cattle in and turn them on the
range when there are honest ranchers
nearby

  why dont the lil fellers just up an
bodaciously bust this horween hairpin
between the horns  tex demanded

  horween has gunmen fact is they
run his outlaw spread he is riding
around most of the time spotting cattle
they can steal there are few of the
small outfits left-and most of them not
able to begin to stand up to horween
but theyll try theyll have to and
horween will kill them just as sure as
they do

  one of his gunmen aint goin to
bother tex succinctly advised he
rolled a smoke and said dryly y
know i always found it the best to go
right to the root of things take this
horween now get a man who can
sashay right up lookim in the off-eye
spit in er an tell him to drag his iron
fill im so full of lead they gotta melt
im to bury im next bust his segundo
the same damned way

  youll always find the rest of the
pack will roll their tails an run

  are you a gunman she asked and
then w-why i dont even know your
name

  i dont know yours neither

  its honey walters

 honey hon-eeeee he sighed
name sure fits well honey my brand
is tex claydon dont tell me youve
heard of it

  her lips compressed and she tried to
look angry then she laughed who
hasnt a wild fight-for-fun high-rid-
ing dancing cowboy who makes love for
the fun of it but you arent a profes-
sional gunman and if you were i doubt
you could stand up to sug horween
add- she held up another finger to
check off on-that the small outfits
couldnt pay you if you were-she
shrugged

tte started to tell her there would be
pay enough if she-but he stopped
this idea he was wise to ways of guns
horses and women this girl would hate
him for the very suggestion if she ever
loved a man it would be for himself-
not through gratitude

  anyhow tex told himself this was
no affair of his and he wasnt the butt-
in sort hed forget this ride on there
would be other days and other girls but
dammit  would there be another like
honey walters  he figured there would
not

  mebbe youre right he agreed
then to make talk what sort of hom-
bre is this horween cabron

  vicious she shuddered he cor-
nered me once i can still feel his lips
on my face his hands    ugh i man-
aged to beat him off with a quirt and
get away and his whiskers-uh hor-
ween tex is a half-head taller than
even you dirty red hair and always
has a three or four day growth of beard

  on his face he drinks raw tequilla until
hes half insane

  tex claydons voice was a concen-
trated thing of harshness then he
packs two guns too worn low an tied
down he spat

  you know him

  i met him a couple days ago he
growled botherin a lil mex gal only
about sixteen he said wed meet again
usual folks do if they rod this country
long enough an i never like threats
to run after me too long best settle
them early yknow i reckon its a
mans duty to stomp out snakes like hor-
ween an come to think of it i dont
like the idea of ridin on leavin you to
be finally run down

you think you could use a hand
i will use one she declared only
tex-remember i am human dont try
to run your hand too far please
until you ask me to he promised
reluctantly

 t her little place along quirt
creek tex claydon unsaddled the
horses and turned them into the corral
while honey walters went inside the
three room log cabin to cook supper

  it was peaceful here on this little wil-
low-lined creek the murmur of it was
music to texs ears he smoked a cou-
ple of cigarettes then snapped the butt
of a third one to the ground when he
heard horses splashing across the creek
farther down

  he went to the house theys some-
body cornin he said if they aint
friends i wanta know it before they
come on up

honey looked out worriedly she
said its old gabe taylor bill south
and banty giles they own small
spreads below here theyre about the
only ones whove a chance to fight hor-
spicy-adventure stories



ween-and theyve little hope just
courage

  the three men more above than be-
low middle age dismounted by the cor-
ral and came toward the house they
stopped stared from tex claydon to
honey walters slowly shaking their
heads

  honey old gabe taylor said nod-
ding at tex is this the ranny thet kilt

sonal chips in this i owe it to mysef
to meet horween an rid mysef of at

  threat besides my killin toltec has
brought this trouble to a head just try
declarin me out

  listen honey began she did not
finish what she started

  outside in the gloom of thickening
dusk a rifle laid flat vicious sound into
the evening quietude the bullet
screamed through a window and smashed
dishes on a shelf the chatter of two
more saddle guns added to the smashing
noise windows tinkled out and lead
sped through the doorway to slap into
the walls

  outside tex claydon snarled his
six-gun in his hand he leaped headlong
through the door rolled over and over
gained his feet and made the shelter
of the corral a flash of gunfire came
from along the creek he fired twice
the deeper boom of his six-gun rolling
down the rifle tones

hhaylor south and giles had gained
the outside and were adding their
gunfire to the rising hell the rifle fire
ceased then abruptly commenced again
from a point farther beyond the creek
again running forward to gain the
water edge tex claydon sent his lead
at a rifle flash a man choked cried
hoarsely and there was the sound of a
horse running riderless into the dark

  tex went on a dark sprawled shape
lay across the creek tex knelt beside
it the rest came up banty swearing
softly and mopping where a bullet had
cut one cheek

  hell south grunted thats rin-
con yait next to buck stole he was
horweens best gun-hand damf i cn
figger why they-

  they had their answer then from
across the creek a scream of despair
struck pointedly it came again honeys
voice calling for tex

help-tex horweens got me and

   the yelling ceased in a way that only
 a hard sudden blow could bring about
 a datter of hoofs a mocking laugh
 and horween had gone

horween leered brought the knife up
and came toward her

 running his face a devils mask in
 which his green eyes blazed tex clay-

don splashed across the creek and gained
the corral he listened intently he
could hear the thud of horweens horse
and the beat of the hooves was slow

  he didnt run off our horses tay-
lor squalled dont stand there lets
get after him an-

  an be a fool tex snapped hes
goin slow he wants to lead us on after
him at direction an while were all
follerin them skunks at bushed us to
get us away from honey they will be
gtrippin the range of ever head of cat-
tle an likely burnin down your homes

  go warn everybody get all the men
you can ill foller horween honeyll
be back-but horween wont dont
stand there dammit hist your tails an
make a fog

  they didnt like the complexion of this
thing but they had to admit tex clay-
don was using his head

  claydon if horween should stop
you- giles began

jtex claydon wasnt there to
hear he was riding into the night
in the direction horween had gone he
rode carefully and his horse seemed to
know-lifting its hooves and setting
them down almost silently it was said
of tex claydon he had the ears of a
wolf and the scent the gift of it to
track a man by smell

  horween must have gotten worried
he speeded up his plans were not
working out hed expected to lead
them all pell-mell then give them the
slip yet there was no sound no sign
of pursuit at all he went on faster
now working higher into the footstool
range

  tex claydon his horse not carrying
double made easier time he did not
want to get too close just yet no tell-

ing what horween might do to the girl
then abruptly on a timber-studded
bench all sound ceased claydon list-
ened straining in the night a hard
cold fear assailed him as he quitted his
horse and went ahead on foot

  horween had holed in somewhere
perhaps but would tex gaydon find
the place on time

ttoney walters opened her eyes
as a match flared and the dim
murky glow of a smoked-up kerosene
lamp flamed up she was she could tell
by the looks of things in some old line-
riders shack or outlaws roost her
head spun and her jaw where horween
had struck her ached steadily

  he had dumped her on a long bench
beside a homemade table the girl rolled
off the bench and ran for the door curs-
ing horween was after her grabbed
her spun her around she fought him
silently knowing there was little use in
screaming

  a heavy open-handed blow dropped
her to the floor conscious but unable
to defend herself she knew she was put
back on the bench knew her hands
were looped above her head her feet
tied together beneath the bench leaving
her in a strained defenseless attitude

  making animal grunting sounds hor-
ween stepped back he pulled a bottle of
tequila from his pocket drank deeply
croaked throatily hope sprang inside
the girl when someone tapped on the
line shack door

  boss came the gunman buck
stoles voice they aint no sign of any-
body cornin

  stay out anyhowhorween snarled
mebbe when i get done with this snip-
py too-particular little wildcat ill hand
er over to you
pistoleers paradise



  horween came toward honey wal-
ters stopped leered down at her he
took a clasp-knife from his pocket
opened it and hooked the point of it
under the collar of her shirt slowly
his eyes glassy mouthing strange sounds
he cut the shirt away honey writhed
whimpered closed her eyes

  he grabbed her roughly and a numb
icy dread seized her even the pain as
his fingers cruelly bit into her tender
flesh could not thaw the ice around her
heart

  she cried out faintly and tears
squeezed from under her lids as the
point of the knife went under her belt
and cut it one pants leg the other
and horween slit them with the blade
she felt the cruel thrust of his hands
but faintly as he seized her last outer
garment tore it from her and held it
triumphantly above his head

  she blushed from head to foot then
grew cold again horween was slowly
bending down to her she struggled but
the writhing of her body only mad-
dened him only gave cruel strength to
his arms she felt his hot breath on her
face her throat his terrible hands were
clutching her rough fingers pinching
and clawing if she could have defended
herself but she was worse than help-
less with her feet tied beneath the
bench

  she twisted this way and that pant-
ing sobbing crying horweens fiery
big hands grabbed her and held her
she suddenly commenced to scream even
though she had no hope that it would
help her

  horween was lost to everything but
the perfection the purity of her body
he held her tighter   

  you low-damn skunk-stand up

p round through clenched teeth the
words had a sibilant hellish hiss to
them that penetrated the fog of hor-
weens mind it was a voice he knew
the voice of a man who stopped this
sort of thing once before

  horween stepped back honey be-
tween him and tex claydon who stood
just inside the door he glared the hate
of hell at tex he slavered ground his
teeth

  your watcher shouldntve smoked
i sneaked up on the glow on his ciga-
rette tex growled an i hit as hard
as i could with the barrel of my gun
he wont wake up

  you wont give me the even breaks
horween snarled

  you never give this girl no break
damn you but ill give you a rope

  gun leveled he came on inside im
cuttin you loose honey when i do
get me that lass rope hangin on at peg
i-

  horween dropped his feet from under
him and fell behind the bench to which
honey was tied as he fell he drew
his guns tex claydon too however
fell to the floor he saw what hor-
weens next move would be

  on their stomachs heads lifted guns
thrust before them each man sought to
thumb his gun-hammer first fire
streaked under the bench as horween
and tex claydon fired the report blend-
ing as one tex felt the sting of splin-
ters as horweens lead ripped a long
gouge in the floor

  all the energy the nerves the will of
tex claydon went into his gun-hand
then he thumbed the arched hammer
back let it fall continued this one-
two-three-

a heavy bullet caught horweens left
continued on page 
   kill the girl he loved and
   escape the nazi headsmans
   axe that teas the situation
   that confronted bradley
    could he outwit them

a bright dust-flecked ray of the
late afternoon sun slanted across
the barred window of the cell and
formed a network of light on the damp
cement floor

  ted bradley rose from the cot and
jammed into one corner of the steel and
stone cubicle flexed the broad sweep of
his shoulders and sauntered to the win-
dow he gripped two of the bars and
pulled out his arm muscles

  five days good god hed go mad
if they didnt do something soon do
something his firm lips smiled mirth-
lessly there was only one thing theyd
do-ultimately he knew what to ex-
pect his head on a block in the prison
yard and a black-hooded executioner
wielding a razor-sharp axe-a heads-
mans axe

  there wasnt a chance in the world to
squeeze out of it time and again he
had asked permission to communicate
with the american consul but nothing

 deaths

doing these heinies knew enough to
avoid international complications-just
yet

  maybe he had been a fool even to at-
tempt it they had warned him in
france that the german border was an
impassable ring of iron but the lure of
excitement made anything possible and
plausible if only he hadnt lost his head


puppet

and clubbed the storm trooper to death
but even that was a matter of self-
preservation it was a case of either the
troopers life or his own

and now he was waiting five long
inactive days good god why in hell-

the sound of a key scraping in the
rusty lock of the cell door brought

by ken coopeb

him around two prison guards with
leveled carbines stood in the gloomy
corridor the barred door swung open
one of the men motioned for ted to
come out

  a guard skipped ahead of him and
called a halt where the corridor turned
to the left and led to the high-walled
yard without a word he opened a
solid steel door the second guard
jammed the muzzle of his carbine into
teds back and prodded him across the
threshold the door clanged shut and a
bolt slipped into place ted was alone

  for long minutes his eyes swept the
room it was without windows or visible
means of ventilation a yellow light
shone from a reflector sunk into the
center of the high ceiling not a stisk
of furniture graced the complete barren-
ness it was just four walls a floor
and a ceiling

  ted wondered as he tapped a wall and
found it to be steel sheeting whether
he was to be subjected to some caba-
listic torture some modern nazi inqui-
zition

  again he examined his surroundings
noticing what seemed to be a box-like




spicy-adventure stories

loud speaker attached to the wall over
the door as he looked at it a voice
poured from the grilled baffle-board

  it was a thick teutonic voice a
voice trained in the giving of orders a
voice that was without personality a
cold steel-tempered voice

  herr bradley  it boomed ted came
to automatic attention you have com-
mitted the crime of murder against the
nazi state for this mein herr the
punishment is-death there was a
long pauses a silence broken only by the
impulse hum of the loud speaker

  however the voice continued we
are prepared to offer you your life for a
service in berlin at present there is a
russian spy we are certain of this and
yet have no proof under these condi-
tions we are powerless to act the
voice bristled

  and yet this enemy of the state
must be destroyed without endangering
our diplomatic relations with the coun-
try this spy represents are you willing
to trade freedom for murder will you
agree to do away with this spy if we re-
lease you you are even now being
watched raise your right hand if the
proposition appeals to you 

nly the hum of the loud speaker
and the mad excited beat of ted
bradleys heart cold beads of sweat
formed on his forehead

  well mein herrf the voice was
imperative demanding

  ted drew a deep breath it sounded
like the blowing of a bellows in the
steel-walled room his hand came up
slowly until it was above his head

  gut the voice boomed you have
chosen well mein herr now listen care-
fully this spy is at present employed
in the rokoko tanspcdast on the alex-
ander plats you will go there tonight

and strike up an acquaintance some-
how you will be informed as to the
spys identity as you leave the prison
you will be given money sufficient for
your needs the rest will depend upon
you

  here for the first time the voice
changed pitch it became ominous re-
member mein herr that at all times you
are being watched one false move and
it will be the end good luck

  there was a click in the loud speak-
er and even the power hum died a mo-
ment later the steel door swung open
a guard stood at attention in the corri-
dor ted glanced at the loud speaker
then he stepped out of the room

a n hour later he emerged from a
black car that had stopped on the
wilhelmstrasse the car sped away im-
mediately and he was left a free man
with one thousand gold marks in his
pocket

  it had all happened so quickly and
with such military dispatch that ted
was left with a sense of awe he knew
what he had bartered in exchange for
his life but not until this moment had
he considered what his ultimate fate
would be granted that he did do away
with the spy would prosecution for
murder follow it was too late to do
anything but go ahead

  after engaging a room and making
himself presentable ted inquired for
the rokoko tanzpalast he found it
easily somewhat surprised to discover
it to be an immense night club splashed
with gilt and chromium and crowded
with merrymakers of both sexes

  the show was in progress when ted
entered and was led to a small table ad-
jacent to the polished dance floor he
was amazed at the parisian brevity of
the chorus girls costumes for the most
deaths puppet



part they were large buxom girls with
blonde hair and a nordic fullness of fig-
ure

  thin net brassieres made little effort
to cover the smooth white globes of
their soft breasts sweeping his eyes
along the line ted could see ten twin
hillocks swaying and trembling in lus-
cious unrestraint he dropped his line
of vision to the weaving lower portions
of their enticing bodies

 shimmering silk dance trunks
sheathed their mature hips and the upper
fullness of their powdered thighs tight-
ening with every motion of the dance
and limning the sweep of magnetic
woman-curves beneath

tthe  chorus danced out to a spon-
taneous burst of applause and its
place in the silver spotlight was taken
by a young man smartly attired in a
tuxedo he bowed and approached a
microphone in front of the band-stand

  the orchestra went into the opening
bars of a popular ballad and the youth
sang his voice was husky and liquid
like that of a female blues singer when
his song was concluded the orchestra
increased its tempo and his small patent-
leather shod feet clicked rhythmically on
the hard floor in a graceful tap dance

  ted was watching the entertainers
tap technique and thinking of fred as-
taire when a waiter approached his
table ted accepted the menu thrust
into his hands but his eyes popped as he
noticed a typewritten note attached to it
he read the message quickly

  the entertainer now on the floor is the
  one we suspect you will make every ef-
  fort to leave the country once your mission
  is over you may cross the border at aix
  la chapelle

  ted tore the cryptic note from the

menu card and slipped it into his pocket
he glanced up at the waiter the mans
stolid german face was an impassive
mask he motioned him closer

  that man who is dancing he said
what is his name

  herr linskaya mein herr

  ted licked his dry hot lips you will
bring me first an order of pigs knuckles
and then you will inform herr lin-
skaya that a gentleman-an american
gentleman-would like to speak with
him

  the waiter nodded ja mein herr

hped had decided on his method of
procedure long before the young
singer and dancer approached the table
a quizzical smile of greeting curling his
too-feminine lips

  you wished to see me sir he quer-
ied in german tinged with the faintest
of russian accents

  you speak english herr linskaya
ted countered

  certainly

  ted extended his hand i am theo-
dore bradley a theatrical producer
your performance interested me i won-
dered whether you would consider an
offer to return to the united states with
me

  the young man drew up a chair his
manner was soothingly gracious i am
afraid herr bradley that it would be
impossible his lean white fingers
smoothed down the silk lapels of his
tuxedo jacket i am returning to rus-
sia soon he said to my home

  ted hid his annoyance but the op-
portunities for one of your talents are
marvelous in america linskaya i
might offer as much as  a week
he leaned over the table confidingly
it deserves consideration and discus-
sion this is no place for it cant we

find a more private atmosphere your
dwelling perhaps or mine

  the entertainer shook his head i
am sorry but i will have to perform
again at midnight and-

  thats perfectly all right linskaya
im going to remain to see the entire
show through anyhow ill wait for you
then we can go to my place or yours
and discuss the matter at greater length
youre young now you know and op-
portunity only beckons once

  the russian smiled ted was cer-
tain he could detect something behind
that smile it was almost secretive

  it is a waste of time herr bradley
he said but if you insist-

  i insist

touring the intermission between
performances when the floor was
crowded with dancers ted slipped out
of the tanspalast and down to the street
the palms of his hands were nervously
moist and his heart-beats were thunder-
ous against his ribs

  he found a hardware store open and
as calmly as possible purchased a bone-
handled hunting knife the hlade of
which folded up so that the knife could
be slipped into a pocket

  returning to the tanzpalast and his
table he waited anxiously for midnight
and the last performance of the russian
it was a grisly business but in the final
analysis it was again a question of his
life or the young mans he knew he
could never leave germany alive unless
the deed was done

  if only linskaya had been a little old-
er and somewhat repulsive as it was
he was just a youngster whose face had
yet to know a razor it seemed a shame
to snuff out so immature a life but the
macabre warning of the loud speaker

voice offered no other course remem-
ber mein herr it had said that at all
times you are being watched one false
move and it will be the end

  midnight came and with it the final
performance of linskaya at its con-
clusion he joined ted still attired in his
tuxedo but carrying a black felt hat

  shall we go to my room ted
queried fearful lest the nervous trem-
ulo of his voice betray him

  it will be my pleasure to entertain
you at tny apartment herr bradley
linskaya replied however i might
warn you that i will be deaf to your
offer

  ted forced a wan smile he was
thinking of how soon the boy would be
deaf to all offers of the ghastly end in
store for him it made him shudder to
think of it murder in cold blood with
his hand guiding the knife ugh

thhe russian occupied a pleasantly
artistic two-room apartment on the
oberstrasse he poured cherry brandy
into small crystal glasses and set out
slices of white sturgeon and pumper-
nickel

  zum wohl sein herr bradley he
toasted

  ted sipped the brandy right now he
had no stomach for anything his only
desire was to get the nasty gory mess
over with and then to put healing dis-
tance between himself and the scene he
patted the pocket containing the knife
crossed the room and placed his half-
empty brandy glass on a sideboard his
next gesture was typical of american
good-fellowship he slipped his arm
around the russians shoulders

  linskaya did a strangely suspicious
thing he jerked away spasmodically
color drained from his cheeks and his
blue eyes flamed
deaths puppet



i should be insulted but im not
women are my interest linskaya not
men he winked meaningfully i sup-
pose you have your fun with those chor-
us girls at the tanspalast dont you i
wouldnt mind company like that myself
nice breasts and big strong bodies on
most of them eh

  color returned to the russians waxen

suddenly he released her
shot a crashing fist to her
jaw as the gun roared

  for a chilling moment ted was cer-
tain the russian knew he was marked
for death then linskaya smiled sheep-
ishly

  i am sorry herr bradley he mur-
mured but in berlin there are so many
of these men who-

  teds heart slipped back into place

cheeks but it burned in two pink fever-
ish circles his eyes avoided teds

  er-yes of course he mumbled

  ted came close to him again about
your coming to america linskaya he
dropped his hand on the youths shoul-
der filled with a sense of shame at hav-
ing to match himself against anyone so

slim and undeveloped why youll be
making a thousand a week before you
know it man

tn order to free his right hand so that
it might secure the knife he tapped
the back of his left hand against the
russians chest in a gesture of emphasis
the movement brought startling reac-
tions in both of them	
linskaya leaped back his hand
flashed to the rear pocket of his trou-
sers and came out gripping a short
stub-nosed automatic dazed teds eyes
moved from his own knuckles to the gun
leveled from the russians hip he was
sure that-

  i think you may go now herr
bradley linskaya said quietly his
voice was pitched on a low even keel

  ted shook off his amazement isnt
this a little silly linskaya he snapped
do i look queer you show me a
woman and ill prove im not

  i think you had better go the rus-
sian repeated

  ted shrugged he turned toward the
foyer he could hear the russians foot-
steps behind him suddenly he ducked
spun on his heels and lunged at lin-
skaya

  hurtling through the air he felt the
hot hiss of a bullet and heard the roar
of its thunderous discharge a timeless
moment later his right shoulder hit the
russian above the hips

  down they went with ted on top and
linskaya fighting like a tiger beneath
him the gun had slipped out of his
hand but he raked his fingernails over
teds face with animal fury ted groped
for the knife in his pocket but some-
thing held him back he hadnt the
heart to kill the man while he was con-
scious it would be better-easier-to
knock him out and then finish him

  he drove his fist into linskayas face
blood gushed from a cut lip a quiver
shot through linskayas body and he lay
still his face white as the bosom of his
shirt ted slipped his hand over the
mans chest to find the exact location of
his heart to mark the spot where the
knife would go in

rttfie moment he touched the chest his
fingers snapped back as though they
had contacted fire teds eyes widened
and his mouth gaped open for a long
silent moment he sat astride the rus-
sians body staring at him in stark fro-
zen amazement

  then with trembling hands he ripped
away linskayas black bow tie and wing
collar his fingers were too cold to un-
hook the gray pearl studs instead he
tore the shirt down the front a gasp
escaped his lips there beneath the
stiff starched bosom were a womans
young rounded breasts twin mounds of
firm white-skinned flesh that rose and
fell feverishly with each breath

  ted wanted to reach out and assure
himself of the reakty of those heaving
globes but he knew it was no optical
illusion these were full mature
breasts linskaya was a young girl

  feverishly like a man who is fighting
against the truth he grasped the sus-
penders on the russians slim shoulders
already in his minds eye he could en-
visage that in place of male undergar-
ments he would find lyred hips encased
in tissue-thin panties and sleek colum-
nar thighs melting into gorgeous limbs
already he was convinced that the
sweetly rounded breasts were no curi-
ous anomaly of nature linskaya was a
woman-and a beautiful one

  completely forgetting his mission ted
lifted her in his arms and bore her to
the adjoining room as he carried her
deaths puppet



his mouth was so close to her lips that
he could almost feel their throbbing
warmth

  returning to the living-room ted
filled a glass with cherry-brandy he
forced the liqueur between her pale lips
having first wiped the blood away from
them that done he massaged her warm
flesh in order to restore circulation steal-
ing the opportunity to kiss her again and
again

ft soon she regained consciousness

   her eyes fluttered open a reflex
protective mechanism inbred by con-
stant deception brought her hands to
her breasts horror pinpointed the pu-
pils of her eyes her half naked body
stiffened

  why didnt you tell me ted whis-
pered

  realizing that her disguise was no
more her hands slid off her breasts
you-you must understand herr
bradley she gasped it is only that
a woman cannot leave russia to appear
on a foreign stage only a man her
eyes pleaded eloquently please you
must understand

  the hideous reality of his situation
struck ted like a blast of cold wind
this girl--she must die at his hand
there was no other way except-
what is your name he questioned
your real name

  her bosom swelled as she sucked in
air sonya linskaya she breathed
i swear to you herr bradley that it is
nothing else save what i have told you
the muscles of her gently curved body
rippled under alabaster skin if you
think i am one of those women who
dress in the clothes of a man because-
because of twisted desire-

  she paused abruptly sitting up with-
out warning she twined her arms about

teds neck and urged her warmth
against him her moist mouth found
his lips and clung there

  somehow teds hands moved up her
smooth skin toward her armpits the
feel of her arms around him soft and
warm and young set his blood throb-
bing hotly    sent it racing like a fever
through his body melting it like so
much putty

  she sank back slowly on the divan
bringing him with her she was breath-
ing fast and her eyes were closed her
cheeks were pink with the warm flush
of pulsing blood her skin burned be-
neath his lips

  for an instant he drew his mouth
away from her clinging lips god   
youre beautiful he gasped

  her heavy-lidded eyes urged him on
the languor of her slow movements-
pulling his arms around her more tightly
writhing closer as her lips hungrily
welded to his-all inflamed ted beyond
control   

a chime clock in the living-room
had just struck three sonya
kissed ted lazily then rolled gently out
of his arms

  now she whispered now do you
believe 

  ted made no reply already he was
passing through a torture of mental hell
the knife in his pocket was a leaden
weight on his heart how could he kill
her now his eyes lingered on the soft
swell of her breast that was where
the blade should go right where the
flesh curved out to form the taut globe
right there in his minds eye he could
see blood staining the alabaster skin
blood on her breast blood from his
knife

  he jerked erect no no

  the light from the living-room fell


sp icy-adventure stories

across her face tears dampened her
eyes you-you do not believe me
even now she queried

  ted stared at the loveliness of her
panic seized him he wanted to be
alone to think

  yes he gasped i-i believe you
but-but now i must go

  she came to her feet and followed
him into the living-room her mannishly
cut hair contrasting incongruously with
the graceful swaying of her ripe femi-
nine figure

  she spoke when ted reached the foy-
er i will see you again mein herr

  ted turned for a fleeting moment he
saw her curved body in the warm light
of a floor lamp his eyes were drawn
to the spot where he had imagined
blood-on her left breast the murder
spot

  no he gasped swinging the door
wide

as he emerged from the house ted
was certain he saw a shadowed fig-
ure darting across the street and losing
itself in one of the dark hallways he
fumbled in his pockets for a cigarette
and lit it remember mein herr that
at all times you are being watched
the dire warning rang through his ears

  ted turned up the collar of his coat
a fine penetrating mist was falling he
had no idea as to what his next move
should be when he had agreed to the
barter of life and death not in the wild-
est flights of imagination could he have
d-reamed that his victim would be a
woman

  one false move and it will be the
end

  yes this was a false move and the
end would be-the headsmans axe he
tried to shake off the cold that permeat-
ed his body to tell himself that this

russian girl meant nothing to him but
it failed to work he knew now that
after those hours with her after his
lips tasted the nectar of her mouth that
she had wormed her way deep inside
him how could he drive a knife into
the girl he had caressed

  lowering his head to keep the chill
cutting mist out of his face he walked
quickly toward the wilhelmstrasse
possibly they had been wrong and the
girl was not a spy no her very dis-
guise pointed to espionage ted thought
of warning her so that she might escape
the country but that would mean death
for them both each idea his mind
fastened on tenaciously was in turn dis-
carded

  no matter how he looked at it sonya
linskaya was marked for death if not
by his hand by anothers

  he hesitated on the corner tom be-
tween a desire to return to the russian
girls apartment and give her a fighting
chance for life and a pitiful hope that
he might lose himself in the metropolis
lose himself  it was a grim joke these
nazis were combinations of vultures
and bloodhounds even now he was
certain alien eyes were watching him

  he glanced up the street someone
was approaching the mist was an ef-
fective curtain but he could hear the
tap    tap    tap of feet-feminine
feet suddenly a muffled scream pierced
the gray shroud followed by the thud of
a falling body

hped ran in the direction of the cry

   a hundred yards from the corner he
almost stumbled over the figure of a
woman crumpled on the wet pavement
in the dim light of a street lamp he could
see her hard pretty face painfully con-
torted she was clutching her right ankle
with taloned fingers
deaths puppet



 i-i have fallen-slipped mein
herr she panted my-my ankle-i
think it is broken gott the pain is
killing me

  ted leaned over her her coat was
open and he could see the full-blown
maturity of her figure beneath a cheap
rayon blouse she reminded him of the
dancers at the rokoko tanzpalast her
face was attractive for all its blood-red
lips and mascara-coated eyelashes

  you live far from here fraulein
he questioned

  she managed a smile ja too far
she sat up favoring her twisted ankle
her hand slid to her breast gott in

himmel how my heart beats she
leaned back squaring her shoulders and
tightening her bodice over the soft curve
of her bosom the tip of her tongue
licked her lips if you will help me
mein herr she purred i will see that
you will not be sorry

  ted straightened common decency
demanded that he be of assistance the
girls too evident flaunting of herself
was a secondary consideration and one
that at present he was inclined to ignore
he searched the street for a cab but
none was in sight he slipped his hands
under the girls arms and lifted her off
the wet pavement she leaned heavily
against him so close that the warmth of

ted stared in amazement
his russian spy was no
man but a lovely young
girl


spicy-adventure stories

her plump body pierced his closely but-
toned jacket

a moment later twin headlights
loomed out of the gray blackness
and a cruising taxi came along the
strasse ted hailed it and helped the
woman in not until he was seated be-
side her and the door closed did she give
the driver the address

  it occurred to ted as the taxi whizzed
along the wet street that this might be
the means whereby he could elude who-
ever was stalking his trail at least it
would give him temporary respite to
collect his scattered thoughts

  therefore he made no objection to
entering the womans shoddy disor-
dered room after he had helped her up
a flight of rickety steps

  she sat down heavily on a large chair
close the door ja mein herr and turn
the key eh frau hoffnagel my land-
lady sometimes would like to know too
much she slipped out of her coat it
is her business i ask you whether i en-
tertain a handsome man in my room
eh she straightened her blouse
pressed her hands for a moment to the
under curves of her breasts and such
a handsome man she gushed you
are american ja mein herr

  ted nodded he watched her strug-
gle with her blouse to pull it over her
head the bottom of it caught under
her breasts shielded by nothing more
solid than the top of a diaphanous slip
finally she got it off rumpling her flax-
en hair in the process

  the key mein herr she said you
had better lock the door and put the key
on the dresser her hot eyes narrowed
we will not be going out either of us
will we

  ted followed instructions when he
was through the girl stretched out her

arms one kiss mein herr she whis-
pered before it is too late

  something in her eyes warned ted
but not soon enough a voice sounded
through the locked door-the same cold
steel-tempered voice

  herr bradley you have performed
your mission

  teds eyes were riveted to the door
he knew an answer was expected but he
waited

  speak the voice boomed

  n-not yet

  there is little time herr bradley
you were within striking distance once
was your hand that of a coward we
give you final warning the man lin-
skaya must be removed you have un-
til dawn if you fail it means-death
by the axe

rphe hollow echo of footsteps sound-
ed in the hallway teds hand shot
out for the door key as he turned he
faced the flaxen-haired girl she was
standing erect on both feet covering
him with a gun no longer was she at-
tempting to impress him with her lush
beauty a faintly contemptuous smile
curled her lips

  you will remain until i am ready to
dismiss you mein herr she said quietly
it is too bad such a cheap trick fooled
you next time you will know better
ted stood rigid something the voice
had said was shooting through his mind
like a bright ray of hope the man
linskaya must be removed    the
man linskaya   

  they were under the impression the
russian was a man he looked at the
woman with the gun and thought of
sonya young fresh maidenly he
formed a mental picture of her in femi-
nine attire her short-cut hair covered
by a hat yes yes it was a chance
deaths puppet



  he watched the flaxen-haired woman
as a cat watches a mouse the minutes
dragged by interminably long madden-
ingly quiet finally the woman spoke

  you may go now mein herr if you
wish her breath quickened agitating
her breasts do not play the fool she
muttered go and do as you have been
told and then return to me eh

  ted managed a knowing smile you
mean-you mean-

  ja she whispered her eyes bright
with desire i will be waiting

  ted drew near to her he placed his
hands on her soft shoulders and moved
them slowly down her arms he was
amazed to find her skin so warm and
silken

  the woman quivered and her head
went back she raised her arms and
twined them about his neck go  she
panted do not be long

  ted kissed her moist parted lips
they were hot her body went limp
against him with his mouth against
hers he counted off the seconds when
he reached ten he stepped back suddenly
and drove a crushing blow to the point
of her jaw

  there was just the cracking sickening
thud of bone against bone the womans
eyes rolled and she slumped ted
caught her before she dropped and
dragged her to the bed

tt was four oclock when ted brad-
leys thumb pressed the buzzer button
at sonya linskayas door a long
soundless wait punctuated only by the
throbbing beat of his own heart marked
the passing of time then padded foot-
steps behind the door and a husky voice
who is it

  herr bradley ted whispered

  a key turned in a lock and a bolt
slipped the door opened a crack ted

caught the glint of a revolver then the
russian girls pale beautiful face she
swung the door wide when die recog-
nized him ted stepped inside and
closed it behind him

  theres no time to lose he gasped
you must listen to me and trust me
he brought a bundle of feminine gar-
ments from beneath his coat put these
on hurry

  the girls eyes widened i-i do not
understand

  ted shoved the bundle into her hands
the nazis know youre a spy he
panted this is your one slim chance
to escape his voice broke i-i was
supposed to kill you in exchange for my
own freedom please trust me

  sonya tensed her cheek musdes
twitched spasmodically when she spoke
her voice was a monotone i trust only
myself she said how am i to know
whether or not this is a ruse beneath
her pajama top her firm conical breasts
trembled

  ted balled his right hand behind his
back he measured the distance between
them if her reflexes were good he
would probably get a bullet through his
heart somehow he was unafraid once
long ago he had saved a drowning man
by beating him into unconsciousness
now-

  he came off the balls of his feet fist
flying the gun in sonyas hand roared
but the death-dealing bullet only creased
his ear and sped on to bury itself in the
wall

  ted sickened as his blow landed it
was a crushing drive to the girls jaw
that dropped her in her tracks for a
fleeting moment before she sagged her
body arched and all the lovely woman-
curves of her figure were limned beneath
tight-drawn pajamas

ill debt to

a larry
kerrigan story

a single shot shattered the
noonday silence it blasted
through the shimmering heat-
waves of upper british guiana echoed
across the slimy green stretches of the
sluggish mazaruni river and on the
heels of that barking report larry ker-
rigan felt his sharp-bladed shovel being
torn from his hands by the impact of a
high-velocity slug

  even as the implement went skittering
from his numbed grasp kerrigan threw
himself face-forward upon the gravel in
which he had been digging a diamond
pipe that gravel was a vein of coars-
er stuff in the heart of a bank of yel-
lowish-blue clay near the slow-flowing
mazarunis edge

  for the past six days larry kerrigan
american adventurer had been probing

in the wilds of british guiana
fortunes rogue once more finds
his sweetheart in peril what will
their fate he-to die slowly with
a bloated corpse
for company
or-
the devil

into that gravel pipe had been ex-
tracting occasional chunks of greasy ma-
terial which under microscopic examin-
ation would prove to be octahedral cry-
stals-yellow diamonds in the rough

  a week before kerrigan had pur-
chased the claim from an evil-looking
frenchman named lablang the deal
completed lablang had departed
down-river toward lake maza-cuyuni
with kerrigans money in his pouch
and now after six days of solitude an
unexpected bullet had knocked larry
kerrigans spade from his hands

tz- errigan hugged the earth slow-
ly he worked his hand toward the
holstered webley automatic at his belt

  no telling what this attack might
mean it might signify the approach of
a roving band of thieving pork-knockers
-worthless untrustworthy native ne-
groes bent on murder and robbery or
perhaps the local brown-skinned mun-

by robert
leslie bellem

and then he saw the mun-
durucu girl bathing per-
haps he could bargain
with her   




spicy-adventure stories

durucu savages had decided to hit the
war-path it might even be a blackleg
white man-an escaped libere from the
penal colony in french guiana to the
eastward hard characters those who
escaped the hell-hole of cayenne char-
acters who wouldnt hesitate to slit a
throat or shoot a man in the back if it
brought them profit

   yet larry kerrigan had no fear eith-
er of white men or black for the past
five long years he had played a lone
hand-had faced long odds and won
through against the world in the far
corners of the globe the adventurer
known as fortunes rogue was a man
both feared and respected by his ene-
mies and larry kerrigan was for-
tunes rogue

  now pressed flat upon the ground
kerrigan stared grimly toward the bank
of the river from there the unexpected
shot had come from there he might
expect another at any moment

  through the sticky humid heat-haze
he peered at the green-scummed maza-
runi abruptly he noticed something he
hadnt seen before it was a native pira-
gua-a canoe made of a hollowed log
the crafts snub nose was buried in the
muddy bank of the river but its owner
was nowhere in evidence

  once more the american soldier of
fortune started slowly cautiously to
inch his hand toward his holstered web-
ley and then unexpectedly out of the
surrounding jungle verdure a voice
spoke crisply-in english

  dont go for your gun my friend
youre jolly well covered-and im an
excellent shot i put a bullet through
your shovel-handle as a warning now
you can get to your feet and come slowly
toward me-with your hands in the
air

  kerrigan stared at a sun-tanned

chunky man in the jungle-green uni-
form of the b g p p-the british
guiana provincial police the constable
had his service  trained at kerrigans
middle

  there was no other course but to
obey larry kerrigan arose slowly
stiffly with his palms shoulder-high in
token of surrender but beneath his ap-
parent submission hot resentment
seethed anger prickled the short red
hair at the nape of his neck to be taken
thus easily-without a struggle-was a
grimly ironic jest of fate and kerri-
gan knew what lay before him if the
british officer took him back to george-
town on the coast

there was a price on the head of

   larry kerrigan known as for-
tunes rogue he was a wanted man
a hunted man the police of many out-
lands would pay much to see fortunes
rogue under lock and key gun-run-
ning illicit diamond buying an occa-
sional necessary killing-these and many
other offenses were chalked upon the
slate of kerrigans misdeeds and now
the grim game was apparently over
the race was run-and lost retribu-
tion had seemingly caught up with
larry kerrigan at long last

  kerrigan spoke harshly do you
mind telling me just what this is all
about constable he demanded

  not at all your name is lablang
and youre under arrest for murder

  a sudden surge of hope leaped
through kerrigans veins then this po-
liceman did not suspect him of being
fortunes rogue the constable had
made a mistake had assumed him to be
that evil-faced one from whom kerri-
gan had purchased this diamond claim

  kerrigan smiled thinly youve
in debt to the devil



made a mistake he said quietly im
not lablang

  come come my man the constable
in green stepped forward swiftly cor-
poral jeffry harker isnt that easily
fooled youre wasting your time try-
ing to pull the wool over my eyes
but im not listen corporal hark-
er i purchased this claim seven days
ago-from a frenchman who called
himself lablang hes evidently the
one youre after well hes not here i
gave him my money took over his claim
he went downstream at once-and i
havent seen him since then

  the green-uniformed policeman was
evidently unimpressed he kept his
well-oiled  aimed at kerrigans heart
again i say youre wasting your time
with your lies he clipped out you
murdered a man named ted mcnair-
an american who owned this diamond
pocket or rather you shot him mor-
tally and threw him into the river at
the same time you kidnaped mcnairs
wife anne mcnair unfortunately for
you mcnair managed to catch hold of
a drifting log and floated down to the
factors shando on lake maza-cuyuni
below here he lived long enough to
tell his story then he died i set out at
once to capture you-and now ive got
you stick out your wrists for the cuffs
my bucko and then tell me where
youve got mrs mcnair imprisoned i
dont want to waste any more time

  as constable harker spoke larry
kerrigan went slowly pale beneath his
deep tan he saw the whole thing
now that frenchman lablang had
tricked him lablang had shot the
american ted mcnair and dumped
him into the river-mcnair being the
true owner of this diamond claim
lablang must have had mcnairs wife
tied up somewhere in the jungle when

kerrigan came up-river in search of a
likely-looking diamond claim lablang
had sold this stolen claim-mcnairs
claim-to kerrigan then the french-
man had decamped probably lablang
had stopped only long enough to pick up
mcnairs wife in her hiding-place then
had taken her downstream with him  

  but it was not this reconstruction of
the picture which brought sudden pallor
to larry kerrigans lean weather-
seamed face it was something else an-
other knowledge cruel and penetrating
the knowledge that lablang had kid-
naped anne mcnair-she who had been
anne ordway-

  anne ordway who once had been
larry kerrigans sweetheart back in the
states

jike the drums of doom that knowl-
edge pounded into kerrigans con-
stricted heart in his minds eye he saw
anne as she had been when last he had
met her in burma half a world away
sharply poignantly he recalled the
sweet fragrance of her golden hair the
lovely contours of her firm breasts and
slender hips the liquid melody of her
voice and the haunting beauty of her
azure eyes   

  kerrigan had loved her would always
love her until time itself was not but
she had given her heart to a man named
ted mcnair and larry kerrigan had
aided mcnair in a certain dangerous
enterprise so that mcnair and anne
ordway could marry   

  that had been more than a year be-
fore and now ted mcnair was dead-
dead at the hands of some murderous
frenchman named lablang and anne
mcnair-she who had been anne ord-

   tryst with death spicy adventure for
april


spicy-adventure stories

way-was the prisoner of this brutish-
looking killer of a lablang

  abruptly the knowledge came now to
larry kerrigan that he must somehow
go to anne mcnairs rescue he must
wrest her from lablangs evil esurient
clutches-save her from the murderous
frenchmans bestiality but how how
could he set out to find her when this
british constable had him under arrest

  true perhaps he might be able to
convince the officer that he was not
lablang but to do that he must needs
divulge iris own real identity must ack-
nowledge himself to be larry kerrigan
otherwise known as fortunes rogue
and that would be fatal to his hopes
as fortunes rogue he would still be
under arrest there would be no chance
of constable harker turning him free

  the policeman was already coming at
him with the shining steel handcuffs
ready to gyve his wrists stick out your
hands my lad harker was saying
lets get this business over with
and then larry kerrigan stiffened
his widened eyes had seen something--
a long sinuous yellow-bellied shape
crawling swiftly at the officers ankles
a surucucu-a deadly brown-splotched
snake the dreaded south american
bushmaster-the ten-minute snake
whose poisonous fangs brought paraly-
sis and death to a human being within
ten minutes of its striking

 a t precisely the same instant
one days journey down-river two
persons faced each other in a shabby
unkempt canvas tent one was the dark-
visaged scowling frenchman lablang
the other was the golden-haired anne
mcnair

  despite the terror which now held
her in rigid thralls anne mcnair was
ineffably lovely her hair was like silk-

spun yellow metal and her eyes were
blue-shining stars the pallor of fear
was upon her delicate features and her
hand fluttered to her swelling firm
breasts as lablang drew sneeringly
closer to her in the confined space of
the shabby tent

  she could feel the desire that ema-
nated from him as he stared at the out-
ward-curving contours of full breasts
the lyric sweep of her hips and thighs
a great fear was upon anne mcnair--
a fear that this was the culmination of
six days of terror in which lablang
had toyed with her as a cat plays with
a mouse intuitively she realized that
she could no longer fend him away-
that she could no longer plead any ex-
cuse to escape his brutish kisses and his
coarse attentions   

  la petite is surely not afraid of my
arms and my lips lablang grinned
thickly meaningly

  dont-dont touch me anne mc-
nair whispered terror stricken she
crouched away from him cradling her
breasts in her protecting arms

  do not touch her she says lab-
lang laughed harshly mille tonnerre-
but do you think i am made of ice hein
for nearly a week you have held me
off with your womans excuse but it
will no longer hold water my pretty
one you know and i know that there is
no reason now why i should not make
love to you sacre blew-do you take
me for an idiot

  i take you for a murderer anne
cried out wildly you killed my hus-
band i saw you shoot him and throw
him into the river    and now-

  and now petit-chou i shall slake
my love-thirst upon your late husbands
widow grande dieu-i have waited
too long for this moment already and
the frenchman sprang
in debt to the devil



ttis hands snaked out clutched at
annes blouse the silk parted with
a ripping sound fluttered in ribbons
about her slender waist she wailed a
frightened cry tried to cover her un-
brassiered breasts with her ineffectual
palms but lablang had her now had
her in his strong bear-like arms his
sinews were vise-strong steel-hard she
fought against him kicked at him struck

just as the constable said stick
out your hands kerrigan saw
something writhe by the others
leg  a deadly gurueucu

at his ugly face with her tiny fists but
he only laughed at her sardonically tri-
umphantly he laughed and lowered his
lips to her mouth

  his reeking fetid-hot breath was nox-


spicyadventure stories

ions upon her face and she could feel
his mouth working at her crimson lips
forcing them open    she tried to
bite him but he only grinned and trans-
ferred his kisses to her shoulders her
arms her throat   

  oh god how long must this agony
endure she wondered desperately she
could feel him pawing at her sinking his
thick fingers sadistically into her palpi-
tant flesh he was bearing her back-
ward-bearing her toward the pile of
smelly blankets on the far side of the
tent

  no-no she gasped as she felt his
hands at the belt of her whipcord skirt
tearing at the garment that hugged her
squirming hips his rough shirt was
rasping her delicate skin   

  helplessly impotently she writhed
and struggled against his foul advances
his stubbly beard was like sandpaper
upon her soft white shoulders and his
panting breath blew gustily in her face
like a hot wind from hell in her agony
she managed to raise one knee spas-
modically she brought it up   

  he rasped out a savage agonized
curse and on the heels of his insane
blasphemy he struck her across the
cheek with his open calloused palm
then he struck again this time with his
doubled fist-buried his knuckles into
her cringing body so that her entire
being was a raging inferno of pain
damn you he roared you would
cripple lablang heinf mais-i have
a way of dealing with such as you a
third time he punched her take that
you yellow-haired slut he grated i
will teach you to kick me you she-
devil 

vvlhmpering with pain she now
cringed away from him crouched in
a huddled pitiful heap upon the dirty

blankets a blue bruise already showed
upon the white skin of her body  a
bruise that loomed darkly against the
delicate flesh tones    the marks of
his fingers showed redly upon her pale
cheek and her golden hair hung in wild
tumbled disorder about her sobbing
shoulders miserably now she cowered
awaiting the inevitable moment when he
would force himself upon her once
again the moment she must capitulate
to his overwhelming strength-

  but he did not come toward her again
not for the moment instead he drew
back still cursing viciously you shall
pay for that knee you fed me in the
belly he snarled i promise you-my
love-making will be of a most unpleasant
sort when i come back then he
limped out of the tent holding his mid-
dle   

  alone anne mcnair looked wildly
about her if only she might find some
weapon-a gun a knife-she would end
her agony here and now her husband
ted mcnair was dead lablang had
murdered him there was nothing in
life for her now-nothing but the prom-
ise of lablangs evil caresses   
death would be far sweeter than another
session in his sinewy arms death would
be a sure avenue of escape   

  but there was no weapon no instru-
ment with which she might slay herself
lablang had craftily seen to that his
revolver and his knife he kept with him
constantly there was nothing in the
tent that she might use-

  she crouched down upon the blankets
and an overwhelming bitterness now
descended upon her    the bitterness
of inevitable defeat surrender degrada-
tion   

t arry kerrigans hard grey
eyes had widened as he perceived
in debt to the devil



the deadly bushmaster-snake crawling
toward police constable harker now
the american adventurer opened his
lips to cry out a warning

  but already it was too late the
surucucus fangs were already striking
at the officers ankle in another split-
instant the death-venom would penetrate
harkers flesh-

  larry kerrigan took a long desper-
ate chance-the only possible chance
he went for his holstered webley even
as his hand flashed downward toward
the weapons grip he knew what to
expect constable harker had the drop
on him and when he made his move
harker would draw only one conclusion
the policeman would think that kerri-
gan was attempting to murder him   

  all this flashed through the ameri-
cans mind in less than the twinkling of
an eye and then he had whipped out
his webley taken lightning aim he
squeezed the trigger-and leaped side-
wise even as the weapon roared and
spat flame

  simultaneously constable harker
pulled his own trigger blast you he
snarled youd try to shoot me eh

  larry kerrigan staggered as hark-
ers slug tore into the fleshy part of
his shoulder had kerrigan not leaped
sidewise that bullet would have found
his heart as it was the  pellet clipped
through the fleshy part of his upper arm
missing the bone kerrigan scarcely felt
the pain his attention was too desper-
ately centered on the snake at which he
himself had fired

  larry kerrigans slug had gone true
it had smashed full into the bushmasters
writhing length had shattered the rep-
tiles back yet even so the whole thing
had beer in vain the surucucus fangs
sank viviously into constable harkers
ankle

  the officer yelped and jumped back-
ward he stared down-and went white
god in heaven he gasped out a
bushmaster-and it got me then he
turned his widened eyes on larry kerri-
gan great god man-you took a
chance on drawing your gun and shoot-
ing that damned thing knowing id
misunderstand  knowing id think you
were trying to plug me knowing id
put a bullet through you

  the american soldier of fortune now
nodded grimly no other way he
clipped out had to take that chance
even so i failed to save you but theres
hope ive got a packet of serum and
a hypo in my duffel wait here

t ike a flash kerrigan raced for his
tent at the edge of the clearing
instants later he was back again with a
first-aid kit swiftly he sliced away the
constables shoe-top cut a deep criss-
cross wound in the officers ankle just
over the puncture-marks of the bush-
masters fangs then making every
precious second count he plunged a
hypodermic needle into a tube of the
surucucu-serum-the only known anti-
dote for the bushmasters deadly venom
filling the hypo he jabbed the needle
into the policemans leg just above the
spot where the snake had bitten

  that done he smeared potassium per-
manganate crystals into the open criss-
crossed wound he had sliced in harkers
flesh then at last he stood up trem-
bling

  already constable harker was be-
ginning to writhe stiffly rigidly as swift
toxins coursed through his agonized
veins he managed to gasp a faint
query you -youre sure you jabbed-
the proper-serum into me-

  kerrigan nodded grimly he knew
what was on the other mans mind in


spicy-adventure stories

that country one must carry very many
snake-sera each is an antidote for only
one particular sort of venom a man
bitten by a fer-de-iance must employ
fer-de-lance serum a man bitten by a
bushmaster must inject the bushmaster
serum any mistake is inevitably fatal

  larry kerrigan smiled thinly at the
prostrate police constable yes he
said im sure it was a bushmaster
that struck you-and i gave you bush-
master serum

  but harker was past hearing com-
plete rigidity-almost catalepsy-had
already set in the man would remain
utterly paralyzed for at least twenty-four
hours then with luck he might poss-
ibly recover  if that serum did its
work

  swiftly kerrigan carried the uncon-
scious policeman to the nearby tent laid
him on the cot he placed a water-
canteen close by so that the constable
could reach it upon emerging from un-
consciousness with that attended to
kerrigan gave attention to his own
wounded shoulder awkwardly now he
bound the flesh-wound soaked the band-
age with antiseptic solution then he
inspected his webley automatic reloaded
it there was a grim tenseness to his
mouth as he made swift preparations for
departure he no longer had police-
corporal harker to contend with he
was free to go to the rescue of anne
mcnair free to find her and take her
from the clutches of that murderous
frenchman lablang   

  kerrigan resolutely closed his eyes to
the possibility of failure he had a cer-
tain plan in mind a plan that might
bring him successfully to the end of his
venture but meanwhile he went for-
ward with his preparations for one
thing he must make sure his first-aid
kit was in proper order-

  inspecting it he noticed that a vial
of fer-de-lance serum was leaking a bit
it was his only supply of that particular
serum and he might need it ere his
journey was done he poured the con-
tents of the leaky vial into a different
bottle-the empty bottle from which he
had drawn the bushmaster serum for
constable harker he made a little
mark on the newly-filled vials label so
that he would recognize it so that he
would know it did not contain bush-
master serum as the label read but
instead contained fer-de-lance serum

  then closing the kit he went quickly
out of the tent strode forward toward
the river

qwift tropic darkness had fallen

   anne mcnair saw a light coming
toward the tent in which she lay ex-
hausted she tensed a numbing fear
clutched at her heart lablang-
she whimpered

  swinging his lantern the frenchman
shoved his gross bulk into the weather-
beaten canvas shelter oui it is lab-
lang and the hour has come for our
little feast of love nest-ce-pas he
came toward her leering

  anne tried to draw herself away from
him tried to cover her nakedness with
the filthy blankets upon which she lay
but he snatched at them pulled them
from her and then he feasted his pig-
like eyes upon her revealed femininity

  slowly implacably his gaze took in
the white contours of her breasts her
delicately-modeled hips her slim bare
legs he leaned over her grabbed her
crushed her against himself   

  her breasts ached with the pressure
of his embrace he kissed her unwilling
mouth repugnantly and foully

for a single long moment she fought
against him but it was to no avait he
in debt to the devil



you rati rasped kerrigan and sprang like a thunderbolt at lablang

was too strong for her too powerful
at last she relaxed went limp   

  what did it matter she closed her
eyes to this ultimate degradation this
climax of misery strangely even as
she resigned herself to the inevitable she
thought of someone she had not seen in
more than a year a man who once had

loved her-and who had surrendered her
to ted mcnair the man she had mar-
ried larry kerrigan

  why should she think of him now
she had last seen him in burma-on
the other side of the globe she had
no reason to think him anywhere within
a thousand miles of her now yet some-


spicy-adventure stories

how in her minds eye his vision arose
before her-tall lean hard-featured and
sun-tanned-

  if it were only possible to summon
him to her aid if only larry kerrigan
were here to protect her from lablangs
unholy caresses   

  but that was impossible of course
wearily closing her eyes she now
clenched her tiny fists as lablangs foul
breath seared her cheek   

  without understanding just why she
wailed out a sudden tortured cry from
the depths of her shame larry-
larry kerrigan-

tn the late afternoon of that same
day larry kerrigan had guided his
piragua toward the bank of the river
for hours he had paddled the dugout
swiftly downstream now he glimpsed
a native mundurucu village and he
swung his craft toward it

  at the rivers edge he had spotted a
crouching tawny figure it was a young
girl of the mundurucu tribe she was
bathing naked in the stream as he
grounded his piragua near her she had
looked at him with lively curiosity

  she seemed completely innocent of any
false modesty as she splashed toward his
beached craft she wore nothing but a
breech-cloth of some woven bark and
her golden-brown body glistened in the
late sunlight her breasts were high
firm her hips rounded and voluptuous

  kerrigan smiled at her the women
of her particular tribe he knew to be
tractable but the men were a suspicious
lot resentful of white intruders there-
fore larry kerrigan knew that he
must proceed cautiously if possible he
must avoid contact with the men of the
village confine his efforts to this tawny-
skkmed young girt

  he spoke thou art a fair maiden

o	little flower he said i observed
thee bathing and i guided my piragua
closer so that my eyes could drink in
more of thy loveliness

  the white mans tongue drips forth
honey the girl answered boldly staring
at him

  my tongue gives voice to the feeling
within my heart he said thou art
beautiful beyond any comparison thy
breasts are like ripening melons and
thy hips are fairer than the dawn thou
must have very many suitors among the
young men of thy village

  aie but no white suitors she
whispered

  kerrigan stepped out of his piragua
touched the native girls arm thou
hast a white suitor now little flower
her eyes had narrowed coquettishly
wouldst give me trade-goods in return
for my love

  aie-even would i give you some-
thing more valuable than trade-goods
behold he dumped into her hand three
of the greasy-looking pebbles he had
taken from his diamond claim thou
lcnowest the value of these stones in
the white mens settlement you will be
paid much money for them

  the girl widened her eyes these
pebbles are for me

  yes in exchange for a moment of
your love    kerrigan whispered
audaciously

  she giggled led him to the seclusion
of an overhanging bank by the rivers
edge i am thine she said simply

  despite his inner urgent desire to
hasten on his journey the soldier of for-
tune felt a tingling sensation coursing
through his veins as he put an arm
around her she was young yielding
feminine and her body was swift to
in debt to the devil



respond to his caresses with a savage
sultry ardor as hot as the tropics in
which she lived   

t ater holding her in his arms he
  asked a guarded question

  there are no other white men near
here

  there is one but he has a woman
a woman of his own color a white
woman with pale yellow hair

  kerrigans pulses began to pound
where is this other white man he
whispered

  his tent is two hours journey down-
stream in a clearing beyond a double
bend in the river he has been there six
days he is encamped in a clearing just
behind a rock which thrusts outward into
the stream and looks like a tiger fallen
on its side

  the american adventurer got to his
feet his jaw was grimly set no ques-
tion about it-from this native girls
description that white man must be
lablang the frenchman and the
yellow-haired woman with him could be
nobody other than anne mcnair   

  without another word larry kerri-
gan leaped away from the tawny-skinned
mudurucu girl hurled himself into his
beached piragua then desperately he
paddled out into midstream set the prow
of his craft down-river

  sweat stood out on his forehead as
he sent the dug-out canoe shooting for-
ward with long sweeps of his paddle
two hours journey that native girl had
said grimly kerrigan determined to
slice that time in half   

  a yellow moon appeared on the far
horizon as dusk descended abruptly
larry kerrigan saw a double bend in
the river before him saw an out-jutting
rock that faintly resembled a sleeping

tiger it was the spot where lablang
was encamped

  like a madman the soldier of fortune
sent his piragua smashing into the bank
leaped clear of the beached craft with
murder in his narrowed eyes he crept
toward a clearing where a dirty tent-wall
gleamed-

  and even as he aproaclied he heard
a feminine voice wail out larry-
larry kerrigan-

an avenging human thunderbolt
larry kerrigan smashed himself at
the tent from which that cry had come
that cry-anne mcnairs cry

  forgotten was the webley automatic
in kerrigans belt forgotten was every-
thing save a savage atavistic desire to
bash his hard fists into lablangs evil
face throttle the breath from the french-
mans thick gullet like a catapulted
missile the american adventurer went
roaring into the tent

  in the dim yellow lantern-light he saw
lablang leap saw the golden-haired
anne mcnair lying spent and helpless
upon the piled blankets where lablang
had pinioned her an instant before in
a flash kerrigan knew what had hap-
pened  and crimson rage flamed through
his seething soul

  you rat he rasped and hurtled at
lablangs throat

  he slammed his fist into the french-
mans mouth felt the impact of splinter-
ing teeth upon his balled knuckles
lablang bellowed bloodily and came
back with a rain of piston-like sledge-
hammer blows kerrigan side-stepped
his foot caught in a blanket on the floor
he stumbled lost balance-and pitched
forward just as lablang bashed a
mighty smash to his unprotected jaw

american soldiers of for-
tune spying in arabia-its
dangerous work at best but
with a couple of native
beauties to complicate it

hodeidah is a section of hell
enclosed by a crescent-shaped
stone wall whose both ends reach
to the shallow harbor the lousiest spot
in hodeidah is the samsarah a flop
house for itinerant merchants thieves
men who prey on women and red sea
riffraff

the two men who squatted on the
pounded earth floor of a second story
cubby hole opening to the gallery that
overhung the compound of the samsarah
blended admirably into their surround-
ings one was broad-shouldered wiry
and had a lean aquiline face the other

was iron hard body and face alike and
was built like a box car though both
were tanned to the color of old leather
neither were arabs




spicy-adventure stories

  the lean man was glenn farrell and
like his companion he wore a compact
turban and a loin cloth the other was
red ohara whose flaming beard was
the envy of the somali coast

   farrell leader of the duet passed as
an arab oharas blue eyes and bold
rugged face and henna-colored beard
automatically made him an afghan
their names varied according to circum-
stance

hphey dared not risk even a whisper
of english their speech was arabic
but in effect farrell said red some-
thing is screwy why in hell did that
gun boat blast our sambuk out of the
water and why did they hose us with
a machine gun when we went over the
side

   because like a couple of saps coun-
tered ohara we left tajura in a boat
loaded with nigger slaves and the brit-
ish patrol was tipped off

   but that declared farrell lowering
his voice doesnt account for the persis-
tent search of the whole damn town
how do they know who to look for 
oharas face lengthened

  by god thats right

  farrell ceased his coffee-making and
probed his loin cloth he dug out a
packet of oiled silk the papers it con-
tained were faked credentials to enable
him to go north to sanaa the capital of
the fanatic imam of al yemen he
tossed the documents in the fire

  someone in cairo got wise that ibn
saoud is sending us to spy on his friend
the imma if were caught with this evi-
dence our number is up

   ohara glared at the coals

  we cant make it without papers
he muttered but in case were jammed
up trying to get out of this louse-bound

corner of hell wed better separate
chances are better for at least one of us
to get through

   right agreed farrell be seeing
you in sanaa

rphe two american soldiers of fortune
were making their final coup before
resigning from the service of king ibn
saoud their mission was to enter the
guarded capital of the kings enemy the
imam of al yemen and find out what
strangle hold that sour-faced prince had
on a powerful desert tribe whose alle-
giance ibn saoud had thus far not se-
cured that done the pay-off then
back to the states and to hell with
arabia

   farrell turned again to his coffee-
making but before the contents of the
burnished brass pot foamed up to the
bell mouth the door burst open a squad
of the governors askaris filed in bayo-
nets lowered

  in the name of his excellency-
nuts for his excellency rasped
farrell and as he spoke his hand flashed
forward splashing the now foaming
sticky coffee into the sergeants face
ohara flung himself aside as a ragged
volley raked the room farrell kicking
over the taper that illuminated the cu-
bicle hurled a newly purchased duffle
bag at two bayonets closing in on him
as it entangled the blades he tackled
low bowling over one of the askaris

   oharas lunge from the flank carried
him through the doorway and dowrl the
gallery

   farrell snatched a rifle plying butt
and bayonet pounded his way to the
gallery the pack wheeled but he
cleared the railing

   a blast of rifle fire spattered slugs
about him as he dropped to a tower of
triangle by arrangement



baled merchandise stacked in the com-
pound the group ol merchants at its
foot scattered in every direction far-
rell rolling down the heap of bales
dashed for the entrance of the com-
pound

  it was blocked a squad of askaris
guarded it

  hell on the sea shore gasped far-
rell which way did red go

  no time to think but the merchants
evening meal gave him a hint snatch-
ing a pot of pilau from the fire he hurled
it at a bearded arab who was scram-
bling to his feet the kettle connected
catching the merchant squarely between
the shoulders he pitched headlong
covered from head to foot with rice and
gravy

  ive got him roared farrell diving
from the shelter of the bales and toward
the prostrate arab help o true be-
lievers ive got a robber

  the guard at the entrance charged
as the law pounced down cm the
gravy covered merchant farrell skirted
the wall and dashed toward the exit

tt worked for about three split
seconds then the sergeant learned
what was beneath the pilau the pursuit
wheeled a ragged volley followed far-
rell into the street

  a donkey with a heavily laden pack
saddle blocked the narrow street far-
rell stretched long legs hurdling the ob-
stacle the pursuit however was seri-
ously disorganized farrell gained and
to improve the lead he tried looping
and doubling each turn stole a yard
from the foremost pursuer but his grin
faded as lie reached the end of a blind
alley the maze had tricked him

  a blank wall faced him and not the
archway he had expected shouts and

the pounding of feet around the corner
became louder every moment the wall
was too high to scale

  an askari rounded the corner far-
rell froze into the shadow of a pilaster
but he was an instant too slow a
whoop a rifle blast and a slug flattened
against the masonry

  this way ya naik

  the askari paused to gesture to the
detachment that followed him as they
answered he bounded down the alley
bayonet lowered

  farrell wrenched savagely at a loose
block in the face of the pilaster hoping
to brain the askari with a well placed
missile it was slipping another tug-

  and that was much too good the
sudden yielding threw farrell off bal-
ance and empty-handed but during
that heart-stopping instant in which he
was wondering whether to pray or
curse-the only two things left to do-
he not only crashed backward against
the wall but through it a door un-
perceived in the shadows had flung
open precipitating him into a dark pas-
sageway

  farrell gained his feet with an instant
to spare he slammed the door and shot
the bolt home the alley was now a con-
fusion of voices and as he crossed the
courtyard the askaris attacked the door
with rifle butts

  the house had the musty odor of va-
cancy

  farrell dashed up three flights of
stairs and to the roof the bolt of the
street door was still holding but it was
time to travel

  he was too far up to dive down into
the street in the rear of his pursuers
he dashed to the further coping from
its edge he looked down to the adjoining
roof a story lower


spicy-adventure stories

  a plump full-breasted woman was
reclining among heaped cushions seek-
ing the sea breeze that filtered in from
beyond the city wall she was unveiled
her broad sensuous mouth was a crim-
son splash against the whiteness of her
face hennaed curls crept from the con-
finement of a head dress spangled with
golden coins she wore voluminous
trousers of scarlet silk gathered at the
waist by a girdle embroidered with gold
thread

  a circassian judging from her white
skin and reddish hair the number one
wife of some dignitary one yeep from
her and half a dozen eunuchs would
make short work of an intruder

  and in the meanwhile the askaris
were pounding the door to splinters if
farrell dropped to the adjoining roof
and thence to the street the circassian
woman would betray his direction of
flight

   might throttle her before she yelps

   he gathered himself to clear the para-
pet  but he checked himself as a slender
shapely syrian girl with swaying hips
and long lashed dark eyes emerged
from the stairway and handed the
henna-haired circassian a note he cer-
tainly could not nail both at one swoop

  and then the door yielded the pur-
suit surged into the house

   he had to risk an alarm set up by two
women

  luck however turned his way the
syrian maid dismissed by her mistress
turned to the stairway and faded into its
sombre depths

tarrell lowered himself over the
side he was barefooted his land-
ing would be soundless and while the
hennaed circassians attention was dis-
tracted by the letter she was trying to

read by the failing light he could slip
to the shadow of the western parapet
without being observed

  only it did not work out that way

  farrell had scarcely landed when he
heard a crumpling of paper and an ex-
clamation of annoyance the circassian
woman was looking directly at him the
discarded note lay at her feet

  ayyub she exclaimed why-i
just got your letter-

  and then she saw it wasnt ayyub
her eyes widened

  farrell gathered himself to lunge but
she smiled and regarded him with
friendly interest

  lets say no more about ayyub
she said beckoning it may be just as
well that he is conferring with the gov-
ernor tonight

  whoever ayyub was his breaking
two dates in succession was giving the
circassian beauty vengeful ideas

  beauty 

  well-a few years ago yes her hips
were as generous as her full blown
breasts and nothing shorter than far-
rells long arms could hold her tight
enough to do either party much good
but she had nice features and tiny feet

  her appraisal of farrells aquiline
face and bare bronzed chest put an
eager look in her splendid eyes

  with that terrible riot going on next
door she said catching him by the
hand i think wed better go down-
stairs wed be conspicuous here

  before they reached the lower floor
he learned she was djenane hanoum
whose husband was in zanzibar but
though that was a long way off zayda
her maid had arranged to open the va-
cant house so that ayyub could follow
the route which had saved farrell

  because i simply couldnt have him
triangle by arrangement



come in my front door she explained
i have to be awfully discreet the gov-
ernors wife is a very dear friend of
mine

  the room into which she ushered far-
rell was a grotesque blend of arabic
architecture and european furniture of-
the gilt-rococco period but djenane
gave him little time to survey his sur-
roundings


spicy-adventure stories

trom a cabinet she took glasses and
a flask of arrak downed a slug of
the blistering stuff and then draped
herself around farrells neck the en-
thusiastic embrace toppled him over in
a heap of cushions he began to envy
the missing lover but before he could
regain his balance the torrid softness of
her body made the problem of leaving
hodeidah less and less important

  somehow she managed to wriggle out
of her pearl-embroidered jacket leaving
nothing but a silk slip between farrell
and that simmering double armful of
amorously scented flesh and when he
finally caught his breath he saw less
and less reason for objecting to the
match though he was outweighed by
thirty odd pounds they were well
placed  

  by dint of straining one arm he drew
her close enough to wake up to the ad-
vantages of circassian upholstery
there was lots of djenane and she was
alluringly soft and resilient and clinging

  her lashes shaded her misty eyes and
in the wavering light of a pair of tapers
she was becoming lovelier every mo-
ment her breath murmuring in his
ear sent thrills racing down farrells
spine    and when one arm uncoiled
from his neck to loosen still further her
clinging pearl-embroidered garments
farrell didnt know whether to lend a
hand or hold her tighter-

  but both alternatives were out of or-
der

  the door flung open djenane gasped
and broke away zayda the syrian
maid was at the threshold

  sitti she apologized i thought-
im sorry-

  get out you idiot flared djenane

  but zayda persisted sitti the gov-
ernors wife-i didnt know-

  a chatter of feminine voices and a
tinkle of anklets came from the hall
djenanes expression changed thrice in
as many instants then she lifted the
lid of a teak chest farrell needed no
directions he made it just as the la-
dies entered the room

  darling the governors wife greet-
ed your maid said you were bored to
tears and that youd like to go to the
hammam with us

  awfully sweet of you purred dje-
nane assembling scattered odds and
ends and doing some swift retouching
before her gilt-framed mirror 

  in a few moments zayda had her
dressed for the street and with her mis-
tress was following the invasion out of
the house

  farrell emerged from the chest he
wrathfully cursed the governors wife
then decided that it might have been for
the better find some of the absent hus-
bands clothes and check out

  his search however was interrupted
a hinge creaked the teak chest was
too far away he snuffed the taper and
darted to the shelter of a pilaster the
door slowly opened he could just dis-
tinguish a shadowy shapeless figure sil-
houetted against the sky glow filtering
in through a barred window

  farrell poised himself the robed fig-
ure advanced into the gloom he lunged
they piled headlong across the room
and into the cushioned alcove

  but those feminine curves certainly
did not belong to any askari farrell
struck light

tt was zayda the gauzy veil could
not conceal the crimson loveliness of
her lips and the delicate olive oval of
her face and her legs exposed by the
disarray of her gown were amber-tinted
fascinations in the taper glow
triangle by arrangement



  ya allah she gasped recognizing
him as she regained her breath i
thought youd still be in that chest

  allah be praised i wasnt coun-
tered farrell still tingling from the
pleasant contact

  the governors car explained zay-
da is the only one in town and his
wifes friends are so crazy to ride in it
there wasnt enough room for their
maids so i had to come back

  all of which gave farrell time to de-
cide that his antics with djenane had
been a bit foolish a deadly waste of
talent

  her next remark hinted that zayda
had a like opinion on what she had wit-
nessed

  are you awfully wild about her

  yes-if she stays at the hammam
long enough he countered and to
make the point clear he reached for an
armful of zayda

  the shapeless native robes tricked
the eye but not his sense of touch he
simultaneously learned that she was
high-breasted that the inward curve of
her waist had been designed for his left
arm and that another instants delay
in kissing her would have left her smok-
ing djenanes unintentional demon-
stration apparently had left zayda a bit
upset

  the syrian girl finally had to break
away to catch her breath and shed her
habara and a few other encumbering
odds and ends farrell saw that his ca-
ressing explorations had given him
scarcely a suspicion of the ivory-tinted
loveliness that now smiled at him
through a single layer of gauze but
before he was fairly cross-eyed from
trying to cover all her fascinations in
one glance zayda cut short the sight-
seeing by drawing him to her torrid lips

  and that was better than any amount
of looking  

  maybe she finally suggested we
could do with a bit of that arrak dje-
nane hanoum always keeps locked up

  the first few gulps of the blistering
stuff were hard to take but as they
reached the bottom of the flask zayda
remembered a quaint turkish song
then they hunted and found more ar-
rak farrell became very despondent

  allah blacken his face he cursed
referring to the governor ive got to
get out of town before sunrise

  between planning on making the flight
a duet arrak and farrell contrived to
give zayda a few hints about the gov-
ernors unaccountable grudge against
him and red ohara

  in the meanwhile the taper was gut-
tering to extinction they both were
passably dizzy zayda was warm and
clinging and they forgot that the gov-
ernors wife would not stay at the ham-
mam forever  

rphey made a charming picture some
hours later but not to djenane han-
oum who had spent an entire evening
wondering when she could break away
from the hodeidah center of gossip

  farrell breaking away from a closely
fitted armful of zayda thought for an
instant he was back in the states listen-
ing to a police siren

  ya mumineen o true believers
help

  djenane was calling for the guard
and the tiles shuddered farrell was the
first to reach his feet but his dash
toward the street was hampered by zay-
da who clutched for support and caught
him about the ankles he pitched head-
long to the floor

  but it wasnt the guard that floored

farrell a second time it was a vase
djenane smashed across his head and
when the city watch arrived scooping
farrell from the deck was simple
enough

  they hustled farrell down the de-
serted streets and through the side door
of a pretentious building a long cor-
ridor opened into an audience room at
the further end of which was a dais oc-
cupied by a hook-nosed white-bearded
arab who radiated garlic attar of roses
and wrath in equal proportions shaykh
yussuf the governor of the city

  the peace upon you ya shaykh
farrell saluted

  no peace to you o son of disease
countered shaykh yussuf he addressed
farrell by his most recently acquired
alias abu faris we know that you
are a spy sent by the enemy of our lord
the imam

  that deflated farrells last chance of
bluff one stroke of a sword would take
the place of evidence and a trial

  then the governor uncorked his sec-
ond surprise he smiled amiably and
said you may buy your head by serv-
ing me instead of ibn saoud my lord
the imam is holding my cousin as a
hostage in sanaa you will go there and
release him from captivity

  the wily imam had secured the fidel-
ity of this official by imprisoning some
relative whose head would guarantee
good faith shaykh yussufs demand
hinted that he was preparing to revolt
against his overlord the imam but
how could that white-bearded schemer
trust farrell

  shaykh yussuf anticipated the query

  i have a hostage to compel your fi-
delity he explained

  farrell froze that must mean that
zayda had been denounced by her jeal-

ous circassian mistress her head
would answer

  the governor clapped his hands an
orderly left the audience hall in a mo-
ment he returned followed by a squad
of askaris they had a prisoner red
ohara

  abu faris said the white-bearded
intriguer if my cousin is not in hodei-
dah within thirty days this mans head
will be spiked to the city gate and i
may first have the hide peeled from his
carcass

  then to a steward daoud get abu
faris some clothing and a mule see
that he gets clear of the guards and
happy journeying to you abu faris

  satan rip you open countered far-
rell as they marched him away but as
he passed ohara he said hang on
red ill make it

week later farrell reached the
end of his march to sanaa a pearl
grey city whose shimmering spires and
minarets towered above the verdant
arabian plateau

  in the old days when the turks mis-
ruled sanaa it was a red hot spot but
since the conquering imam had taken
charge there was neither music nor
mirth neither bawdy houses liquor nor
hasheesh sanaa had become an un-
pleasantly moral town where the execu-
tioners sword cured people of amiable
vices

  farrell glumly eyed the foreboding
fortress in which habeeb ali the gover-
nors cousin was imprisoned

  be damned if this isnt the first time
i ever had to break into jail

  for a week farrell prowled about
town getting the lay of the land

  the women of sanaa were fascinat-
ing with their himyar veils that con-
triangle by arrangement



cealed nothing but the sword of the
imam kept the ladies looking straight to
the front

  at sunset of the eighth evening far-
rell wandered into the leading and lous-
iest samsarah in the city no travelers
had any gossip from hodeidah farrell
was about to go his way when he heard
a stifled plaintive sobbing from a room
on the second floor

  farrell investigated anything to es-
cape his own hopeless problem

  destourl he rumbled tapping at the
door

  a woman answered she did not raise
her veil in time to cheat farrell of a
dazzling eyeful a lovely little creature
with long lashed dark eyes that remind-
ed him of zaydas she was younger
than zayda-but not too young

  her name was ayesha and her room
at the samsarah had been stripped clean
by sneak thieves she was stranded in
sanaa walking to the coast would be
tough on bare feet

  my father she concluded came to
sanaa to be a hostage in the imams
prison i accompanied him and was to
go on to hodeidah to stay with my
aunt and now-

  a fresh supply of tears impended

ayyub she cried ive- and then she
saw it wasnt ayyub   


spicy-adventure stories

  farrell had spent over a week trying
to get into the imams prison and here
ayesha was in a tough spot because her
father had succeeded he was thinking
fast by pleading ayeshas case with
the imam he might get a chance to
play his own cards

  by allah he declared i will go
to the imam i will demand an escort
and money for you-i will tell that
white-bearded goat-

  a brave voice and a face to match
but ayesha had every reason to fear the
stern imam and his many spies

  oh-do be careful she warned in-
terrupting the tirade if anyone
hears-

  she was quite close now and her dark
eyes were wide with mingled fear and
admiration her soft fingers closed on
his wrist ripe warm curves whispered
to farrell through her shapeless outer
lobe ayesha was marvelously well
equipped and as she drew closer far-
rell became less and less concerned with
immediately defying the pious imam

  his plans were becoming slightly in-
coherent but ayesha was not critical
that might have been because only one
of farrells hands now gestured the
other was shaping itself to the latest dis-
covery

  ayeshas eyes were becoming misty
and her breath came in short gasps that
made farrells ears simmer and when
he found her lips she eagerly clung to
him

  luckily the thieves hadnt stolen the
prayer rug  

  but unluckily farrell hadnt barred
the door it slammed open ayeshas
scream lifted the tiles but fright froze
her arms about him before he could
break clear he did not need a guide
book to tell him that someone was jab-
bing a pistol against his back

  dont shrieked ayesha her shrill
voice piercing the oaths that rumbled
like a cavalry charge would you kill
your own daughter 

   she doubtless overestimated the pene-
tration of the pistol but the blast was
delayed

tf the man behind the gun was aye-
shas father he had a remarkably
wide range of action for a hostage if
this wasnt a frame up nothing was

  no by allah raged the irate par-
ent but i will call the guard i will
have him impaled in the public square
farrell was up to his neck this sort
of thing wasnt being done in sanaa any
more not by anyone who wanted to
keep his head

  and you-cutting up this way before
i even get to my cell raged the old
man ya allah-

  wait a minute interposed farrell
desperately snatching at the last words
havent yon been there yet

  the arab gasped taken back by the
irrelevant insistent question

  nay

  then i will take your place said
farrell

  there is no god but allah ex-
claimed the astonished arab

the pistol sagged farrell whirled
sock arms and the man crashed into
separate corners that calmed every-
one  and explanations were forthcoming

  wallah i am shareef nuri said
ayeshas father and before reporting
to the warden i remembered my prayer
rug so i returned-

  does the imam inspect his hostages
very often farrell interposed

  what difference countered sha-
reef nuri he has never seen me he
knows only my uncle whose fidelity my
head guarantees
triangle by arrangement



  that made it a bargain farrell took
the shareefs credentials gave him half
of his cash and paused only long enough
to exchange a regretful glance with aye-
sha

  too bad he muttered as he strode
across the tnaidan this would have
worked just as well an hour or so
later  

  presently farrell presented creden-
tials to the warden

  the food was good and the vermin
not excessive only one move remained
find the governors cousin and make
good use of the hack saw blade which
had eluded the search of the sentries

  a few moderate bribes and farrell
found his man habeeb ali was in a
tower at the end of a corridor and
overlooking the city wall

  that night he hailed the jailer take
me to the cell of habeeb ali get some
tapers so we can play chess

  plausible enough and three maria
theresa dollars clinched it farrell cere-
moniously saluted habeed ali as the
jailers footsteps receded down the pas-
sageway he whispered to the wizened
sharp-featured little man keep up a
lusty argument about this game o
brother and allah will reward thee

ttabeeb ali was perplexed but as
farrell set to work with his hack-
saw blade he caught the point and
staged a good act it muffled the rasp
of the saw and though the blade was
giving farrell more blisters than a row-
ing match it was biting into the soft
hand-wrought iron window bar

  an hour passed and a second yielded
farrell bounded to the sill gripped the
free ends and slowly wrenched them
upward

  go first ya habeeb and may allah

prosper thee farrell invited but the
arab drew back

  nay he protested go your way
i stay where i am

  he meant it it occurred to farrell
that perhaps habeeb ali suspected a
snare

  your cousin the governor of hodei-
dah sent me to liberate you

  i stay here regardless declared
habeeb ali

  farrell was convinced that he was
dealing with a madman

  you idiot warned farrell sup-
posing your cousin is planning a revolt
you know what would happen to you

  my cousin wants me released to
have me assassinated declared habeeb
so that he can inherit my estate now
rub your head or by allah i will call
the jailer

  listen fellow growled farrell
youre going to be rescued whether or
not

  he lunged but he landed only after
habeebs yell had echoed down the cor-
ridor an earthenware jar crashed to
shards then farrell caught up with
habeeb pop the arab froze in his
tracks

  farrell unwound his prisoners tur-
ban spliced it to his own and looped
the free end under habeebs arms then
shouldering his captive he bounded to
the sill as the jailer and the guard came
pounding down the corridor

  it was touch and go farrell lowered
habeeb to the city wall he leaped clear
of the sill as the guard surged into the
vacated cell

  seizing his unconscious prisoner he
cleared the crest beating a hail of slugs
by a split second he crashed heavily
to the ground but badly shaken as he
was there was one advantage the near-

it was a wild piercing scream and
the funereal stillness of the lagoon
threw back despairing echoes as it
ended in a strangling gurgle hal mar-
tin had just arrived in the lagoon and
was giving mental thanks that he had
reached the island ahead of the hurri-
cane then the scream drove every-
thing else from his mind

  he jerked his eyes down from the
harsh green of the jungled hillside to
the glassy water a second later a girls
head broke the surface another scream
followed and the head disappeared

  opening the throttle he aimed the
bow of his trim little cruiser at the spot
but before he reached it she re-appeared
and sank again he threw the motor out

of gear swung out over the rail and
leaned down

  then he saw her in the crystal depth
feminine and white with nice rounded
breasts smooth thighs and softly
curved hips she was floundering badly
as she came up again shed just about
make it without forcing him to dive for
her

  she rose within arms reach he
locked his fingers in her thick black hair
and pulled her head out of water brac-
ing himself by hooking one knee over
the rail he caught her wet wrist and
managed to lift her fainting out of
water and over the rail to the deck

  the contact of her flesh against his
bare arms and against his chest through

his thin shirt sent electric thrills surg-
ing along his spine he glanced down
a firm little breast half bared itself in-
vitingly from her dripping undergar-
ments he felt urged to draw her closer
but the sight of the long black lashes of
her closed eyes resting on her wet cheeks
jerked him back to his senses she was
half naked helpless and unconscious in
his arms

tte put her down on the deck and got
the whiskey bottle from the cabin
cradling her head in the crook of his
elbow with her lovely face turned up
toward him he gently parted the small
red lips and spilled a little of the whis-
key into her mouth

  she gagged and coughed then her
big violet eyes opened horror appeared
swiftly in them

  oh my god she gasped and began
to struggle

  he held her easily she relaxed ex-
hausted

  who-who are you she breathed

  the names hal martin winter resi-
dence miami

  arc you one of them she whis-
pered fearfully

  he eyed her curiously and shook his
head then abruptly she realized her
semi-nudity she gasped and sought
frantically to cover herself with hands
and arms he reddened

  scuse me he mumbled i forgot

  he caught up his slicker which hung
beside the wheel and threw it over her
she hugged it close about her

  my clothes are over there she
thrust a shapely white arm out of a gap
in the slicker and pointed i was afraid
theyd hinder me its a long swim
across will you get them

  sure

  then we can ride out the blow here
in the lagoon she concluded hurriedly

  he glanced at her sharply then raised
his eyes again to the jungle-matted hill-
side for an instant he had the impres-
sion of a sinister nameless horror drift-
ing down from it like a miasma to en-
velope them irritably he shrugged off
the feeling and steered the cruiser to the
narrow ribbon of beach where the mouth
of a trail broke through the jungle wall
she got up shakily and sagged against
the wheel

  ill get your clothes he said quickly
and leaped ashore

  theyre just beyond the rock she
said with a wan smile

  he hurried round the limestone out-
cropping and found a dress of thin flow-
ered silk lying on the white sand beside
it were slippers stockings and garters
everything but the gossamer underthings
she still wore he picked up the gar-
ments a faint perfume rose from them
to his nostrils

  then the girl screamed again a hor-
rible ululation of frantic terror he
jerked round and plunged past the rock

  his boat was floating away from the
beach and the girl was struggling madly
in the clutches of two shaven-headed
tattered men on the deck

  one of the men saw martin he let
loose of the girl and dove for the wheel
with a grinding clash of gears he threw
the motor into reverse the cruiser shot
backward out into the lagoon

  as it did so the girl writhed free of
the second man and threw herself over-
board leaving the slicker in the mans
baffled grasp martin plunged into the
water but before he reached her she
was stroking frantically toward him he
caught her hand dragged her up the
beach and whirled defensively
terror island



dut there was no need of it the boat
was far out in the lagoon the
scare-crow figure at the wheel clashed
gears again water boiled white at the
stern and the lean craft shot forward
in a gentle arc out through the opening
in the reef onto the open gulf stream
beyond the second scare-crow figure
danced in glee on the deck thumbing his
nose at martin and the girl

  martin watched grimly the cruiser
was irrevocably gone was fast dwindling
to a black dot on the brassy water with
the man still dancing on the deck mar-
tin knew he was watching dead men for
the first blast of the coming hurricane
would send the little craft to the bottom
but the thought uppermost in his mind
was that his guns were aboard the boat
and he was unarmed

  then he was aware that the girls
trembling fingers were seeking his

  come she whispered im dressed
now and well have to hurry to get
round the end of the lagoon out onto the
reef there is a little cave there and we
can hide in it i was trying to swim
across the lagoon to it

  wait martins voice was harsh
and his eyes were riveted to something
up the trail beside them

  he strode toward it the thing he saw
was a human foot as he came closer he
discovered that it belonged to the corpse
of an old negress lying naked beside a
half dug grave death must have come
only after long screaming agony had
died to blubbering moans the eyelids
had been cut away and the lips were
missing one eye had been gouged out
of its red socket patches of black skin
and flesh had been shaved away and the
pathetic body terribly beaten a crooked
leg spoke vividly of a knee twisted and
splintered till only the gristle of the
joint held it in place

  beside the grave lay two shovels
these two scare-crows who had stolen
the cruiser must have been digging the
grave and dropped them there martin
decided obviously they had heard him
and the girl down on the beach and
sneaked down to steal the boat

  he stared a long questioning moment
at the eerie silent trail now growing
saffron in the gathering dusk then sud-
denly remembering the girl went back
to the beach

  whats the matter  she asked tense-
ly-

  nothing he lied keeping himself
between her and a view of the dead foot
she caught his hand and pulled him
along the beach

  oh please hurry she cried

  he quickened his steps

tts terrible for you to find yourself
suddenly mixed up in a horrible
thing like this she said hurriedly if
it hadnt been for the hurricane you
would have passed up this island as
though it were any other and now you
would be safe i know you are wonder-
ing what its all about anyone stumbling
in here like you did couldnt help won-
dering why i was trying to swim the
lagoon by myself and why those two
men stole your boat and put out to sea
in the face of certain death ill try to
explain

seemed safe enough but this morning
they came and i havent seen mammy
lou or uncle tom since im terribly
afraid theyve-

  she broke off with a gasp clutching
his arm he stared

  tattered shaven-headed figures had
materialized out of the gloom on the
beach ahead a sinister rustle of the
leaves sounded warning beside them
the girl screamed two more scare-
crow figures leaped out of the jungle
at martin

  his fist slammed home to the snarling
teeth of the first the cropped head
snapped back and the man crumpled
the other leaped tigerishly and whipped
long arms about martins waist martin
twisted futilely lashing knuckles to jaw
and ear the shaven-head jerked under
his mauling fists but the gripping arms
still held to him

  martin heard the girl scream again
and knew they had seized her the
murky saffron gloom was alive now with
tattered men closing in on him he
struck at them desperately and felt the
solid impact of his fists against their
faces but he went down under the
weight of their foul stinking bodies the
man hanging about his waist was uncon-
scious but he still held on the others
began to stamp martin to kick him

  wildly he threw his arms about his
head to protect it he glimpsed a dark
snarling visage and the owner of it
drawing back his huge booted foot he
kicked brutally the toe caught mar-
tins skull with a glancing blow a
burst of stars shone before martins
eyes swift blackness followed   

tvtartin awoke lying on his back
with the yellow light of candles in
his eyes he was in a big room massive
teakwood beams crossed the ceiling

above him along the top of the wall
he could see the tops of leaded casement
windows with the black of closed storm
shutters showing through them

  a long blubbering moan the agon-
ized exhausted sound of a man in the
last stages of human endurance sounded
above the thunder of the wind martin
twisted his head

  he saw several shaven-headed tat-
tered men against the wall staring
breathlessly at a man who sat hunched
on a chair before them the man sat
faced around so that his chin rested on
the back of the chair and his hands and
feet were lashed down tightly to the
chair legs his back was bare to the
waist and was a mass of bloody
shredded flesh

  leaning over him was a huge hulking
beast of a man with a knife in his hand
this big mans head was cropped too
and his nose was crooked his lower
lip was loose and a large drop of saliva
drooled from it his eyes were little
and piggish and aflame with an unholy
light

  as martin stared he straightened and
turned to a tall cadaverous figure with a
perfectly bald head lean features and
eyes like black ice he was watching
the bound man on the chair and stood
enveloped in a long ragged black cape
buttoned about the throat

  to i go ahead  breathed the bullet-
headed man

  the figure in the cape nodded the
line of staring tattered men swayed

  gawd aint he had enough blurted
one his white pocked face twitching

  the caped figure spoke through
frozen lips

  he was guarding the girl when she
got away this is the reward for
failure
terror island



  but we got her back whined the
pocked man

  then this shall be a lesson for all of
you so that you shall know what to ex-
pect if you fail again proceed swart
the bullet-headed swart whipped his
glittering knife with frantic eagerness
to the bare bloody back of the bound
man on the chair the blade sliced
through the cartilege holding a pair of
ribs to the spine the blubbering moans
crescendoed to a ghastly scream then
broke off on a high agonized note while
the motionless tattered man against the
wall stared in hypnotic fascination the
mans head sagged

ffartin could scarcely believe he
was actually witnessing such hide-
ous butchery it was like a terrible night-

martin caught her in his arms heaved upward

mare that constricted his lungs and
throat with such mad terror he could
scarcely breathe his thoughts turned to
himself surely that tall caped man could
not have failed to recognize him thats
why he wasnt dead already they were
saving him for torture already he
seemed to feel the gloating degenerate

swart leaning over him and probing his
vitals with that bloody knife

  desperately martin sought to throw
off the terrible paralysis of horror he
gritted his teeth with the effort to rise
thongs bit into his ankles wrists and
chest he was lashed down tightly to the
table top like a dog in a vivisection

laboratory then abruptly the knowledge
was dwarfed by the discovery of small
icy fingers clutching his hand he
twisted his head in the opposite direction
and saw patricia bennett crouching on a
chair beside him with her face averted
from the shambles across the room

  he saw that she wore the same flow-
ered dress he had rescued from the
beach for her and her hair was combed
no ropes bound her to the chair the
discovery puzzled him

  suddenly she turned her head and saw
him looking at her she gave a little
cry

  at the sound swart whirled from the
slaughtered corpse and leaped savagely
at martin hal writhed wildly against
his bonds but without avail

  stop

  the word cracked whip-like from the
lips of the cadaverous leader it jerked
the pig-eyed drooling swart to a halt in
mid-stride

  plenty of time for your knife later
swart said the tall man tonelessly and
for a long moment his eyes probed mar-
tins martin steeled himself to meet
their piercing stare without flinching

  in the tense silence the stout storm
shutters rattled savagely under the fear-
ful impact of the mighty wind the
score of candle flames in the big room
bent weirdly as the chill menacing
breath of the hurricane forced its way
into the room through the tight cracks of
doors and windows

  abruptly the caped leader turned to
the girl

  untie your husband and put him to
bed he ordered curtly

  she gasped then hesitantly she
loosened the knots that bound martin to
the table and helped him up he clinched
his teeth at the darting agony of half
paralyzed limbs slid off the table and

nearly sprawled swarts watching eyes
were murderously aflame

  they crossed the floor forcing their
eyes away from the bloody thing on the
chair by the wall martin was aware of
her trembling body against his he
opened the door she picked up a candle
from the nearby sideboard and followed
closing the door after them

hhhe puny candle flame set monstrous
shadows to dancing weirdly in the
corners of the bedroom martin noted a
fourposter bed a low dressing table and
colored rugs on the winking polished
floor the girl backed against the door
wide-eyed and breathless

  there is some trick about this he
said grimly that fiend out there must
have some hideous plan did you tell
him we were married 

  well not exactly when the men
brought us to the house you were un-
conscious and he stared at you a long
time then he asked me if you were my
husband i-i just let him think you
were i thought it might help in some
way if he believed we were married but
i never dreamed it would come to this

  martins brows knitted

  its not like him to be so considerate
of married couples he said half to him-
self

  do you know him she asked
startled

  yes but we have never met so far
as i know hes pocine that infamous
dictator of salvano who was thrown out
of office by a revolution which installed
the present dictator pocine was also
sentenced to life imprisonment on the
salvano prison island for torturing na-
tives i suppose you know all this but
you probably dont know that i am the
man who engineered the revolt against
pocine
terror island



  when pocine and that gang of mur-
derers escaped the prison island by cap-
turing the supply schooner the present
dictator of salvano immediately sent for
your father because he was afraid
pocine would start another revolt

  if you dont already know why
pocine is here i might add that he came
here to murder your father for financing
the revolution against him and also to
get the  in cash your father is
known to keep here

  i know she said hes been hunt-
ing for the money ever since hes been
here maybe hes saving us for torture
to find out where it is im sure thats
what happened to mammy lou

  her voice trailed off with a hint of
tears martins thoughts leaped back to
the butchered negress beside the half
dug grave on the lagoon trail and he
pressed his lips together in fierce silence
he locked the door and smiled at her

  at least if they think were married
it ought to slow swart down a bit where
youre concerned he said he thinks
every unattached girl is his personal
property

  lets go through with it-i mean
pretend to she said hurriedly and
leaned down she caught the hem of her
dress and pulled it off over her head
revealing to him again that sweet allur-
ing body that had thrilled him so when
he rescued her from the lagoon

  his eyes widened a little at the sight
of the silk stockings rolled at the knee
the wispy panties snuggled close about
the soft curved hips and the breasts
locked in their silken brassiere the
vision set his heart to thumping and his
nerves coursing with strange sweet
fire

  she tugged at the brassiere with a
breath taking little quiver of the firm
breasts then seemed to change her mind

she dropped her hands and looked at
him martins eyes went to the elastic
waist band of her stepins roved over the
satiny hips and thighs down to her
dimpled knees

  he gulped and turning his back
kicked off his shoes pulled off his blood-
stained shirt still crimson to the ears
embarrassed by the situation he looked
at the girl over his shoulder

qhe had donned a night gown of the
pinkest sheerest silk and taking ad-
vantage of its dubious protection had dis-
carded the last of her underthings now
she stood barefoot before him arranging
her hair with deft fingers while the
luscious curves of her body outlined
themselves invitingly before his hungry
eyes she caught her breath with a quick
little smile and sat down on the bed

  he sat down beside her holding him-
self gingerly and not daring to trust
himself closer to her intoxicating near-
ness the candle continued to burn
waveringly

  presently he felt timid fingers seeking
his hand and her quivering body snug-
gling up against his side the warm
curve of a little breast pressed his arm
sending a wave of intoxicating fire
through him then he felt the warm
contact of her leg against his through
the flimsy silk night gown it was an
effort for him to keep his voice casual
when he spoke

  has the house ever weathered a blow
like this

  n-not this bad she answered
through chattering teeth dad said
after he built it he shouldve placed it
under the lee of the hill instead of on
top like it now is the light plant failed
tonight when the first blast struck i-
im so frightened

  her voice was drowned out by a hide-


spicy-adventure stories

ous blast of screaming wind and machine
gun tattoo of raindrops and sea spray
against the side of the house martin
held his breath it seemed that the build-
ing must go sturdy and massive though
it was

  as the wind eased a bit he heard the
sound of angry cursing from the main
room he slid off the bed and crept to
the door to listen

  i tell yuh it takes the knife to git
em rasped swarts voice let me
haul that hubby o hers out here an work
on him an youll have the money in no
time hell tell where it is

  youre crude swart pocines voice
was curt and disdainful your knife
didnt get the information from the nig-
ger wench and the devil knows you
worked over her plenty the trouble
with you swart is that you have no
imagination beyond your knife blade
howd you like to be spread-eagled on
your back right now like that nigger
wenchs husband is with an iron kettle
chained to your bare belly and a large
starving rat inside it with no way out
except through your body  its a damned
hungry rat i captured it on the schooner
days ago and starved it for old bennett
damn him

  the cold voice choked with sudden
fury then went on but bennett got
away-this time the niggerll break be-
fore he croaks if he doesnt the girl
will im going to have that money

lytartin forgot all about the scream-
ing savagery of the blasting wind
forgot all about the water squirting in
through every crack in windows and
doors under the gigantic pressure of the
wind desperately he tried to conceive an
escape for himself and patricia a sud-
den cheer from the next room shattered
his thoughts

  heres bennetts dinero shouted a
new voice the nigger finally told us
where to find it yeh we took off the
kettle but we had to pull the rat out of
him an he died we killed the rat too
a long exultant shout answered him
patricia jerked upright in bed

  whats happened she gasped
martin silently took her in his arms
nothing important he answered
quietly and smiled down into her fright-
ened eyes she clung to him sobbing
oh im so frightened

  he kissed her gently maybe pocine
would leave them alone now that the
money was found and maybe not   

there were sounds of clinking
glasses from the main room faintly
heard during the scanty lulls in the
mighty wind pocine must have opened
a case of whiskey thought martin soon
there was ribald singing and lewd re-
marks about patricia then an ominous
silence followed martin jerked up
straining his ears

  without warning the door suddenly
splintered and crashed inward under the
massed weight of the scare-crow gang
they poured into the room patricia
screamed martin launched himself at
them with mauling fists he knocked the
first man flat but went down under the
rush of the others they gripped his
arms and legs beat him pinioned him to
the floor under the massed weight of
their bodies

  patricia leaped to her feet as she
swayed swart roared at the two men
swarming forward to reach her he
knocked them aside and clutched for her
his thick fingers closed around her slim
bare ankle and he jerked her brutally to
him she screamed once then mercifully
fainted

   the gang hauled their two prisoners
terror island



martin kicked as he sidestepped his toe caught swarts ankle

out into the main room someone threw
a glass of whiskey in patricias face she
gasped and opened her eyes the others
pulled her away from swart and lifted
her onto the table

  dance they screamed at her above
the roaring fury of the wind

  she swayed there clutching the
shredded remnants of the night gown
about her

  dance dance

  she took a few uncertain steps and
paused helplessly martin writhed in
frenzied desperation he was seated on

a chair with one man clinging to each
out-stretched arm another gripping him
round the neck from behind and a
fourth standing beside him with an up-
raised chair to smash his legs if he
started kicking he could not break free

  swart rammed the other men about
the table aside

  come here he bellowed clutching
patricias night gown

  she jerked back part of the gown
tore away baring her creamy legs and
thighs

  animal cries burst from the other


spicy-adventure stories

men mine mine their shouts
screamed above the mad clamor of fight-
ing as they clawed and beat each other
to get hands on her

  pocine darted into the tangle with a
big black revolver in his fist frantically
they burst away from him he tossed a
greasy deck of playing cards face down
on the table at patricias feet

  enough of this horse play he
screamed his voice rasping thinly
through the shrieking diapason of the
mighty wind youll be killing each
other shes not worth it cut cards
high man takes her

  with a shout they surged forward
swart slapped them aside and grabbed
his card first he glared at it then bel-
lowed triumphantly

  an ace i git her

  he grabbed patricias wrist and
jerked her screaming off the table

  martin struggled desperately to free
himself but in vain then he was sud-
denly aware that pocine was glaring at
him murderously triumphantly

ulvait a minute swart called
pocine his toneless voice edged
with savage excitement i have a little
job for you first the girl can wait ive
just recognized this gentleman i felt
from the first i knew him and pretended
to believe he was the girls husband until
i could place him his name is martin
the gentleman who had myself and most
of you as well sent to the island for life
bring your knife swart well make
this something extra special

  no hint of the black despair that
gripped him showed in martins face
the wild plan which but an instant be-
fore had flashed through his mind could
never succeed but he had to try it it
was his only chance now-the only
chance for patricia too

  swart is a common yellow coward
pocine he said evenly he only fights
with his knife when the other fellow is
tied down and cant fight back turn
me loose and give me a knife and ill
make him climb a wall yelling for mercy
the dirty murderer and he knows it
yellow coward swarts bull-like
roar dwarfed the clamor of the storm
he dropped patricia and flung himself
straight at martin who did not move
and only grinned coldly at him with a
mighty effort swart checked himself and
turned on pocine

  give him a knife he bellowed
give it to him and turn him loose ill
show whos the coward

  pocines eyes narrowed as he probed
for the trick behind martins words
martin grinned at him wolfishly

  afraid ill get away pocine he
taunted afraid ill commit suicide be-
fore you can torture me  maybe i will
but first ill rip this pet butcher of yours
from stern to stern its a doomed mans
last request of a man whos been a dic-
tator  give me a knife and let me have a
go at him

  an eager clamor burst from the
others pocine turned to swart

  if you kill him ill shoot you like a
dog he warned tonelessly remem-
ber all right one of you toss the fool
a knife and lets get it over

hphe men holding martin to the chair
released him he got up flexing his
arms swiftly to restore circulation
someone tossed him a knife he caught
it and whirled to face swart

  they circled each other warily
swarts piggish eyes were aflame with
fury suddenly he lunged and struck
martin ducked back escaping the thrust
by a scant inch swart leaped and struck
again but martin toed nimbly aside
terror island



red rage blinded swart to caution he
ripped out a filthy curse and hurled him-
self recklessly at this tall lean man in
torn shorts and undershirt who shifted
like a wraith before his attack

  as martin sidestepped he kicked his
toe struck swarts ankle and sent him
sprawling swart struck the floor mar-
tins blade streaked down its point
ripped through the bulge of the left
shoulder muscle swart rolled frantically
out of reach and leaped to his feet
blood streamed from the slight wound
and his pig eyes were cold with respect

  the scare-crow crowd goggled in
silent amazement forgotten completely
was the savage menace of the hurricane
no one heeded the quivering windows
and the flood of water squirting through
the tight cracks in them not a glance
fell on the big barred door which in spite
of its ponderous strength was threaten-
ing to buckle inward under the mon-
strous impact of the wind all eyes were
glued to the two crouching circling fig-
ures in the center of the room

  all too well martin knew he was fight-
ing a losing battle with certain torture
and death at the end of it even should he
win he was no good in this kind of
a fight never before had he tried to
defend himself with cold steel he
glimpsed patricia stiff and white
against the wall staring at him hopelessly
she too knew it was a losing fight
like martin she knew that swart would
not be tricked a second time swart was
fighting coolly and skilfully now and
biding his time

  yet martins eyes were bright and his
chin up he laughed silently as the house
quivered under a terrific thundering
blast of wind that-bent the stout door a
full quarter of an inch inward and drove
black water spurting into the room round
the sides of it if the door should give

way the wind would get inside and blow
the house to pieces as though it were
made of straw

   yet in that door lay martins trick his
final reckless gesture at these cutthroats
which might kill them all-himself and
patricia too

   swart leaped struck and was gone out
of reach again martin lashed back vici-
ously swart ducked and sprang back
wildly as martin swiped another savage
blow at him as swart started to re-
cover martin whipped his knife shoulder
high    and hurled it with all the snap-
ping strength of a baseball pitcher
wildly swart sprawled to safety but
the whirling blade was not aimed at him

   it keened straight for pocine standing
revolver in hand the handle of the
knife instead of the point struck the ca-
daverous pocine in the chest but the
force of the blow knocked him off bal-
ance and he staggered

tn that instant martin reached the
door gripped the heavy bar that
braced it against the wind and wrenched
it upward it resisted him

  the staring crowd suddenly screamed
in mad terror and started for him as
they realized what he was trying to do
with every ounce of desperate strength
he heaved again he heard pocines
insane shout and swarts mad bellow
the bar came free martin dove head-
long for patricia and caught her in his
arms as the door burst apart with a
splintering crash

  the room went black the universe
seemed to explode with a lung-strangling
concussion martin felt himself and
patricia lifted and hurled into the black
roaring void

   they struck in the bushes outside the
hotise branches lashed them like ter-

breasts that threatened to break from
their sheer covering still muttering he
picked her up beneath his huge arm
headed for the next room

  art stirred vaguely struggled up his
own room was empty he was alone
then scream after scream from the ad-
joining room through the piercing
screams came the rumbling haw haw
haw of the idiot-giant art staggered
to his feet looked about for a weapon
snatched a butcher knife from the slab
table and made for the door he paused
horrified

  the girl lay on a pallet of dirty quilts
in a far corner the idiots crouched
body almost obscured her all that was
visible was her flailing white arms her
struggling kicking legs

  her struggles had torn the mans
dirty shirt the empty sleeve hung in
tatters and with a gasp of horror art
saw there was no stump of an arm no
smooth remnant to prove an arm had
been lost accidentally instead from the
very shoulder itself protruded four hairy
fingers and a stump of a thumb the
hand itself grew from his shoulder

a s arts mouth gaped open he saw
the giant lean over the screaming
girl saw him hold her legs relentlessly
with his good arm while the horrible
fingers of his deformity reached inex-
orably toward the soft flesh of the girls
body

  art raised his knife a hand whirled
him aside jethro suggs glared at him
then turned to the struggling mass

  lon lon he said sharply leave
her be lon

  behind jethro stood lafe grinning
over his fathers shoulder at the body
of the woman the idiot brother got
slowly to his feet mouthing and mutter-
ing the old man inclined his head the
idiot slouched by looking neither to the
right nor left

  take keer of her instructed the old
man and turned away to follow before
leaving lafe grasped arts wrist and
twisted the knife from it he picked it
up and followed his father still grinning
still licking his bearded lips as he glanced
back at the white figure on the dirty
pallet

  velma was more frightened than
harmed for a long while she shuddered
in arts arms finally quieting and trying
to restore her tattered clothes to normal-
cy they spoke of their predicament in
low tones

  art was busy counting the remaining
powders in the case in his pocket he
scarcely heard velmas worried voice

  -heard about such families-inbred
for a hundred years halfwits idiots-
dangerous-have to take it easy-
absently art nodded figuring out the
hours of peace he had left before a new
supply of dope became the most impor-
tant thing in his life

  they ate in silence jethro at the head
of the table with his biblical talk his
vague half-cracked platitudes on either
side of him a son-lafe on the right
the idiot lon on the left art sat next
to the idiot leaned as far from him as
possible at the end of the table the
now-smiling velma and the daughter of
jethro bess suggs who arose from time
to time to serve
mountaineers are tough



  sick with fright art ate but little
beneath the table he felt the gentle pres-
sure of besss big leg recognized the
light in her colorless eyes for what it
was arising and returning she always
managed to brush against him to lean
a billowing breast a flabby arm against
his shoulder it was either take this show
of affection or lean closer to the de-
formed idiot who ate so like a beast his
red-rimmed eyes centered on velma
little rivulets of food and liquid trickled
down his hairless chin dripped onto his
enormous chest unheeded

  lafe it was who made the frugal din-
ner a success he smiled simpered
rolled his eyes at velma velma smart
smiled back gave him bold glance for
bold glance talked as much as possible
art glared

rfhe hideous meal at an end jethro
and his eldest son dug out foul-smell-
ing pipes bess arose again returned
with a wicker demijohn and a dirty tin
cup she poured it nearly full of white
liquor the old man tossed it off with a
sucking noisy gulp wiped his mouth on
his sleeve lafe drank next lon the
idiot drank his and beat the cup on the
table for more the girl ignored him
snatched the cup filled it handed it to
art

  i dont drink snarled the hop-head
viciously

  ill take it from velma jethro
frowned lafe grinned approvingly
lon pounded the table in idiotic glee
as she gulped choked coughed but came
up smiling jethro pushed back his chair

  come he said the lord saith
vengeance is mine we air the aveng-
ers of the lord

  lafe followed him smirking at velma
they took guns from the corner pulled
hats over their eyes and paused at the

door keep the infidels here instructed
jethro

  lafe glared at the idiot whose eyes
were fastened greedily on a tear in
velmas dress a tear that half revealed
a mound of palpitant entrancing flesh
he said lon you leave her be tech
her while im gone and ill whale hell
out of ya

  bess sat down as close as she could
to art the little hop-head glared at her
for a moment then chose to disregard
her turned to velma who sat silently by
the window

  damn you he growled what are
you trying to do make a play for the
hick

  shut up art thats the only way i
can keep the idiot off me take it easy
play up and maybe theyll let us go when
they get back maybe someone will
come

  bess spoke bashfully nobodyll ever
come lady nobody never comes to see
the suggs the dern fools think we uns
is crazy 

  she grinned at art who shuddered at
the mouthful of horrible tusks broken
and discolored

  im taking a walk said art and got
up the girl arose he went to the door
she followed she said now lon you
leave the lady be you hearn what lafe
said hell whup you

  art walked out the girl close behind
him at the creek he said listen lady
im kinda bashful wait for me a min-
ute will you

  he stepped into the bushes squatted
on his haunches and dug out the handle-
less spoon he emerged a new man con-
cealed behind his back a thick cudgel

  so long he exulted and crashed it
down across her head the club broke
the girl fell to all fours art turned and
ran

a half mile away she caught him
bogged down and cursing the mud
he tried to fight but she held pudgy
fingers about his windpipe until his
puny struggles subsided she carried
him back and in the struggle or the
homeward journey arts hypodermic
kit slipped from a pocket plunked into
a puddle of water and slimy ooze and
disappeared neither saw it

  near midnight jethro suggs came
home alone his eyes were wild blood-
shot his beard matted his wild hair
waving

  wheres lafe sleepily from bess

  the old mans voice was shrill the
philistines came down like a wolf on
the fold daughter lafe is dead

  bess chewed stolidly on her snuff
twig lon laughed haw haw
haw

  for a long time there was silence
broken nervously by art

  listen old man you cant keep us
here any longer do you know youre
kidnaping and that they hang men in
this state for what youre doing i-

  the old man raised his skinny hand
his eyes fanatical crazy they call us
he shrilled in his edged voice mad
insane now theyre laughing they
think theyve wiped us out them
damned pittmans for seventy years
weve fought em tooth and nail and
now theres only lon to carry on one
by one theyve killed the suggs now
theres only me an old man and lon
a crippled boy you say i cant keep
you here i will keep you ill keep you
for my daughter the woman for my
son ive thought it out on the way
home and thats the only way i can
keep the suggs blood alive in time
theyll be more suggs and then more
maybe i wont see it but after while
therell be enough suggs to wipe the

damned pittmans off the face of the
earth im going to marry you myself
bess get the bible

  art laughed he laughed until tears
streamed down his face he laughed
until he collapsed on the floor and
writhed in agony grimly the old man
watched him velma too was grim
something of the horror of the thing
was growing in her mind impossible
anything was possible in this god-for-
saken place

  the old man found the chapter the
girl bess dragged art to his feet
stood beside him with his shaking hand
pinned in her own the idiot drooling
and muttering stood beside velma who
trembled and cringed at his very near-
ness

  in a clear ringing voice the old man
read the marriage ceremony he didnt
ask useless questions concerning obedi-
ence loyalty and all that he read the
few verses closed the book with a bang
reached for the demijohn and drank
deeply

  and now he grinned evilly youre
married all of you if the pittmans
think they can wipe out the suggs they
dont know old jethro youre mar-
ried he roared at the gibbering idiot
shes your wife lon understand
your wife

  velmas screams echoed and re-echoed
as the man grabbed her with his good
arm the abused dress tore long legs
kicked and waved pointed fingers tore
at a hairless face but the idiot carried
her into the next room

  bess grinned coyly at art art shud-
dered ran for the door the old man
tripped him the girl picked him up
set him down at the foot of a rickety
ladder leading to the loft the old man
said git and art went up the ladder
crying and sobbing the monstrosity
mountaineers are tough



he heard velmas moaning
cries from below then the
nightmare began   

that was his wife followed simpering
grinning

  he heard the dull moaning cries of
velma coming from the room below
interspersed with the loud guffaws of
the idiotic giant then the night for him
suddenly became a nightmare   

fjawn found him semi-conscious
babbling like an insane person as
he searched fruitlessly through his pock-
ets for the hypo kit his bride slept
bovinely on the husk mattress the grey
dawn making her bloated body more
nauseating than ever wrapped in his
search it took him a long time to make
out the voices from below

stand up jethro suggs stand up
the voice sounded familiar

art peered down into the room below
through a crack in the loft three men
stood in the center of the room while
jethro suggs clad in dirty underwear
stood before them his hands in the air

  two of the newcomers were roughly
dressed in overalls faces lean and sat-
urine the third wore city clothes be-
draggled but unmistakably expensive he
wore no hat only a stained dirty ban-

dage that encompassed his head his gun
was a black automatic

  gibbering and crying art swarmed
down the ladder ran toward the new-
comers

  cinch cinch he gibbered thank
god youve come after us cinch
cinch

  the idiot appeared in the opposite
doorway at a word from his father
he took his place along the wall hands
raised the senseless smile still on his
lipless mouth one of the men spurned
art away from the knees of cinch
bogan

  looking neither to right nor left
cinch walked into the other room he
returned the overnight bag in one hand
dragging velma with the other he
whirled her across the room where she
crouched beside art who still mouthed
words of welcome

  she said youre dead youre dead
go away over and over wearily

  cinchs laugh was unpleasant a thing
of wolfishness-savage merciless

  dead baby you cant kill a drunk
the last thing i remember is you bust-
ing me in the head then a lot of cold
water bringing me to i found out aft-
erwards what had happened and found
tonys body too mountain men are
tough baby specially when theyre
drunk

  it was her idea cinch it was her
idea youll take me back wont you
boss

  cinch grinned at his ex-driver

  you were smart art too smart
for your own good youve been want-
ing velma for a long while but now
youre out of luck we came by late
last night and saw the ceremony  what
a laugh that was instead of butting in
i figured it wouldnt be right to inter-
rupt a pair of newlyweds the first night

  cinch and the two men with him
broke into roars of laughter

  excuse me said cinch finally
velma this is my brother rufus and
my cousin choate pittman is the last
name the same as mine didnt know
that did you didnt know i came from
up here that bogan is just a name i
took

  what are you going to do with us 
dully from the crouching blonde

  art blubbered and whined cinch
raised his brows

jtid you think i came up here to
see you no babe i came to
see jethro here i told you i had a debt
to pay didnt i that debt was to kill
jethro he shot my daddy a few months
ago and i just heard about it but ive

cinch cinch turned to jethro

  suggs im a square guy a clean
shooter theres six of us now and only

i think the idea you had last night was
a good one if i dont shoot you now

ple here your sons wife and your
daughters husband

  the old man nodded

  cinch grinned at velma her head
was low her bruised back shaking in
sobs of hopelessness

  no no boss dont do it listen
ive lost my needle ill die im dying
now cinch cinch

  art groveled in the filth of the floor
blubbering and slathering as cinch and
his henchmen went out of the room
mountaineers are tough



 the idiot touched velma on the shoul-
 der she sobbed but dragged herself
 after him

from the loft came the sickening
querulous voice of bess the daughter

in debt to the devil

                     continued from page 

  kerrigan slumped to the ground
senseless

tvthen he opened his eyes he was
fettered hand and foot anne mc-
nair lay beside him similarly trussed
her breasts were heaving with her la-
bored breath lablang was leaning over
her   

  i shall kill you both the french-
man was whispering but first i shall
have my fill of this charmant filles love-
ly charms   

  larry kerrigan squirmed at his bonds
he was helpless could not free himself

  and then he saw something else a
deadly bushmaster snake had crawled
into the tent was gliding swiftly toward
the unsuspecting frenchman it raised
its head struck-

  lablang cried out whirled he saw
the surucucu smashed his heel down
upon its head killed it mon dieu-
he gasped out the thing struck me

  then suddenly he spied the first-aid
kit which was strapped at kerrigans
belt ah-h-h- he whispered harsh-
ly and he snatched the kit ripped it
open his thick trembling fingers ex-
tracted a scalpel the hypodermic syringe
a vial of serum labeled bushmaster
anti-venom nervously he filled the
hypo-needle with serum jabbed the in-
strument into his wounded leg pressed
home the plunger so he breathed
then he slashed at the punctures inflicted
upon his flesh by the snakes fangs
pressed permanganate into the wounds

  larry kerrigan watched through nar-

rowed eyes a sudden surge of triumph
went flooding through the americans
heart lablang had been bitten by a
bushmaster-but he had given himself
the wrong antidote he had used the
fer-de-lance serum in that incorrectly-
labeled phial the phial whose label
kerrigan had secretly marked before
starting on his journey earlier that day

  and now the frenchman was writhing
on the floor in spasmodic convulsions of
agony as the swift deadly toxins ate
their way through his veins the end
was horrible to watch lablangs lips
frothed bloodily and paralysis stilled the
curses that welled into his throat as
death crept toward his heart   

  thus died lablang the murderer

nnwenty-four hours had passed

    kerrigan still lay trussed in the tent
of the dead lablang and anne mc-
nair was still by his side equally help-
less and fettered twenty-four hours of
futile agonized struggle against those
restraining bonds-to no avail

  what would the end be to die slow-
ly of thirst and starvation with lab-
langs bloated corpse for company   
already a numbness a weakness was
overcoming kerrigans efforts to free
himself he lay back panting and spent

  and then he heard annes low sweet
voice larry-beloved-if we die   
im glad    well be    together   

  he twisted toward her anne-ryou
mean-you care for me

  i know now that ive always cared
for you larry kerrigan marrying ted
in debt to the devil



mcnair was a mistake oh larry   
larry  if only things had turned out
differently

  he smiled grimly patiently ive
spent six years in hell my dear ive
done many things i shouldnt have done
unlawful things things that have put
me outside the pale of the law now
im paying my debt to the devil but it
will be easier to die-if i must die-
knowing that you love me and he
rolled his trussed form close to her so
that their lips could meet

  and at that moment someone walked
into the tent

  larry kerrigan stared
harker he croaked

 constable

  the green-uniformed corporal of b
g p p smiled down aye harker
in person thanks to your swift treat-
ment i recovered from the effects of
that snake-bite in the usual twenty-four
hours paddling downstream i saw your
piragua on the beach decided to investi-
gate good thing i stopped what

  he leaned forward slashed kerrigan
free of his fetters sliced the bonds that
tied anne mcnair then he saw the
corpse of lablang and his brows rose
whats this

  thats the man you were looking for
lablang and this is the girl he kid-
naped-anne mcnair whose husband
lablang murdered kerrigan swayed
to his feet swiftly explained what had
occurred

  when he had finished the story con-
stable harker smiled gently before i
left your tent he looked into kerrigans
eyes i took the liberty of going through
your effects i found out that id been
wrong in suspecting you of being lab-
lang i discovered your real identity
your names kerrigan-and youre also

known as fortunes rogue wanted by
a number of countries

larry kerrigans shoulders slumped
youre right he whispered and i

to the coast if i    er    happened
to allow you to escape 

anne mcnair cried a tiny cry flung
herself at kerrigan larry she whis-

think she whispered with those diamonds we could
go back to the states-together   i

suppose its your duty to take me to
georgetown see that i go to prison-
harker nodded thats my duty he
admitted but its hard to jail a man
whos saved ones jolly old life yknow
dyou suppose you might slip through

pered think with the diamonds from
that up-river claim we could go back to
the states together and maybe in
time the world will forget that there
ever was an outlaw called fortunes
rogue  
in debt to the devil



  kerrigan looked down into her shin-
ing eyes you mean that anne he
asked gravely

  she slipped into his arms i mean
it    she whispered

  larry kerrigan kissed her on the lips
while constable harker politely turned
away

  and so with the dawn of another day
larry kerrigan and anne mcnair trav-
eled down-stream toward the coast with
luck theyd make it over the border into
dutch guiana within a few days at
paramaribo theyd catch ship for the
states if all went well and after that-

  after that the world would hear no
more of fortunes rogue   

next month in
spicy-ad venture

     he was a prisoner on the
     road to temiltepan-the
     road of escape which
     means treacherous death
     - the road from which
     few return but he went
     willingly knowing that

     not forgotten him

  then drawing his knife he rolled up

est of the citys gates was half a mile to
the north shouldering the wizened
habeeb farrell charged across the
plain

  if he could reach the pass that cleft
the encircling mountains there was a
chance but farrells heart was pound-
ing his legs were stiffening and the
veins at his temples stood out like fire
hose he had to detour to dodge a
walled estate

  habeeb was showing signs of life
farrell dumped him to his feet

  gallop or ill blow your head off
he bluffed

  habeeb tottered half a dozen steps
then caught his stride the damned lit-
tle runt was swift as a horse and he
headed for the highway instead of the
open darkness

  farrells desperate sprint dosed the
gap but the drumming of hoofs became
louder as that accursed habeeb reached
the hodeidah highway

  the captive tripped and sprawled
headlong across the road

  head for the hills or  bust your
head against the rocks you - -
growled farrell as he closed in son of
a flat-nosed mother-

  his blood froze he heard the pad-
ding of camels feet and the muffled
sound of arms just ahead of him they
were almost upon him and the imams
soldiers were closing in from the rear
he seized a rock and crouched by the
roadside there were only three cam-
els and one lacked a rider he hurled
the missile at the leaders chest

  chunk he reeled in the saddle
cursed wrathfully and recovered only
one such voice in arabia and only one
man who could digest such a blow red
ohara

  hold it red shouted farrell
ducking the answering pistol blast

  pile on said ohara wheeling his
beast

  just a second-

rthe imams cavalry was perilously
near but farrell had urgent busi-
ness he turned booted habeeb head-
long into the gloom then swung to the
saddle

  sure and i got the breaks ex-
plained ohara as they raced south-
ward she was a fine figure of a
woman and she slipped a knife into my
cell so we stole some camels and i
came to get you

  it was only then that farrell noted
that oharas companion was a woman

  you have all the luck red con-
cluded farrell as he told how he had
almost escaped the governor of hodei-
dah

  and what do you say her name
was demanded ohara not the fat
one but her maid

  zayda

  zayda eh

  there was something odd about o-
haras voice but what confirmed far-
rells suspicions was the soft laugh of
their companion and the lowering of
her veil

  zayda herself for a long moment

  he leaped at the peruvian girls
corpse callously stripped away its tight
silken dress then he turned to ellen
come my dear put this on he com-
manded gently

  she swayed toward him bob-bob
darling     

  he caught her in his arms kissed her
reverently 

  and then she dressed and they went
out of that house of death

rfhey were on the afterdeck of the
steamship spardian bob newton and
ellen lanhart the descending sun was
a glowing orange disc on the western
rim of the pacific and callao was a dim
memory far behind them

  my grandfather always said that
death and destruction would follow in
the wake of any attempt to disinter pi-
zarros bones newton said softly he
fingered the signet-ring on the third fin-
ger of his hard right hand the ring which
his dead grandfather had left to him
and then as he touched the bauble
something unexpected happened

  the entablature of the ring popped
open

  newton stared at the secret hollow
place thus revealed he saw a folded
tiny scrap of tough onion-skin paper

  bob ellen lanhart whispered
what is it

  wondering he withdrew the paper
unfolded it held it up in the days
dying light

  a map he breathed look-el-
len a map showing the location of
pizarros tomb in the peruvian wilder-
ness 

  ellen shuddered death  and
destruction  following in the wake
of pizarros bones      she whispered
unsteadily

  bob newton looked at her then at
the unfolded map he smiled a little
grimly then with calm deliberation he
tore the map into many tiny fragments
and spilled them from his palm

  the little pieces of paper danced and
settled to the roiled surface of the pacific

  bob newton turned and gathered el-
len into his arms and somewhere be-
yond the styx francisco pizarro smiled
approval

in the next issue-

jose vaca writes the story of an old bandit who had rav-
ished the gold of mexico for his private hoard    now
feminine wiles sought his secret and wits played like swords
men came down from the mountains and mystery worked by
night    settling the fate of two faithless women by

thieves justice

rible merciless whips ripping the last
of their rags from their bodies but the
bushes saved their lives for they broke
the fall against the ground stretched
out flat in the black roaring maelstrom
of wind and water martin and patricia
dragged themselves forward martin
didnt know where they were going and
he didnt much care death would come
soon enough anyway patricia seemed
to be guiding him

  presently he became aware that they
were under a protecting ledge of rock
there they found a door which they
opened passed in under the ledge and
closed after them shutting out the wind
which came to them now only as a sullen
baffled roar

  this is uncle toms hurricane cave
said patricia he was deathly afraid of
wind and fixed this up i remembered
it

  he heard her fumbling a match
flamed in her fingers and she lighted a
candle on a rough table against the wall
she smiled at him as she stood there like
a wet lovely goddess her luscious skin
only scratched and reddened by the lash-
ing bushes and rough wind

  he slid his arms around her drew her
close   

two days later bennett arrived by
   plane

   if you hurry

how can we do it

its a simple problem in mathematics three months ago we announced that if  readers
would subscribe to this new author-owned book publishing plan we could sell full-size cloth-
bound novels that book stores wouldnt handle at the phenomenal price of  the response
at first was slow we were forced to raise the price to  per book then out of a clear sky
orders came pouring in before we knew it the first edition was sold out and we were over the
 mark

the authors committee immediately ordered a second edition of passion pulls
the trigger it is identical with the  book there are  copies ready to
be shipped to you at  each from now on all our books will be  your re-
sponse has made this possible

dont hesitate passion pulls the trigger is not a reprint nor a magazine its a hard
cover book each page of which will thrill you

          orders can be accepted from the united states only since
          passion pulls the trigger has been banned from canada

the wind blew our house apart and a
beam smashed his head we found the
money in the box beside him two of his
men were blown into the lagoon and
drowned but the others got away in a
small boat right after the hurricane
passed their schooner was smashed to
kindlmg wood

  fine said bennett heartily then
he t rned to martin and grasped his

hand i didnt worry a minute know-
ing you were here hal he continued
you see pat hal here was with me
when we overthrew pocine in salvano
so i radioed him at miami to get over

  but bill wasnt looking at her face
for at last the thing had happened the
thing bill had been dreading like a night-
mare ever since they two had met the
cross-bands that held up the lopsided
crazy step-ins with their frilled edges
suddenly slipped and in another moment
he knew there would be a little heap of
gauzy tissue on the ground at her feet
im gone said bill

  well hed done his best as a human
being and a good decent american

now he just forgot clothilde didnt
help him to remember anything maybe
the pain in bills head had something to
do with it too

woomethings broken said bill
    some time later

  the night had suddenly become vocal
again there was a cheering yelling
crowd overhead muskets were crack-
ling and the pale light of dawn had
begun to replace the moonlight

  but those were not the voices of
prince hassans men they were the
voices of italian soldiers bill arranged
the draperies carefully about clothilde
it was awfully funny seeing her dressed
up like that now but she looked like a
queen as she turned toward the italian
officer who came bursting in followed
by a half-dozen of his men

clothilde out of the labyrinth and tip
into the blessed light of day where a
ragged few of the castles defenders
stood about the italian soldiery while
the bodies of prince hassans soldiers
strewed the ground

  the little chamberlain came pushing
forward eyes agog but we thought
her highness had been kidnaped and
that you were dead he said to bill
and then he winked positively the dig-
