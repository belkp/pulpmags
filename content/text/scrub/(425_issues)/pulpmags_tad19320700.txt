americans chinese and japanese strive to obtain the
precious lost treasure of the manchus in this
exciting story of war-torn shanghai

a qiomlete jbook-lengtji tlovel

by anatole feldman

author of law of the outlawed the trail of the twin tattoo etc

prologue



the sullen brass disc of the
sun trembled perilously on
the rim of the world for a
moment then plunged with an ex-
piring sigh below the horizon the
world within the constricted circum-
ference of that brassbound palpitat-
ing horizon lay panting and shriv-

eled bathed in an unnatural reddish
glow

  the glow of blood

  rugged sand dunes barren for-
lorn bare a rude lean-to supported
by a heat-stunted pine no more
there was no sound no sign of
life

  only the air pulsated and vibrated
in the rhythmic waves of heat that
rose from the sun-parched earth

c
treasure

  it was as if the world had given
up in its perpetual fight with the
sun and was content to expire in the
after-glow of the monster that had
consumed it

then abruptly a puff of smoke
from behind a hummock of sand
followed by the staccato explosion of
a rifle

  inside the lean-to pete sayers
wearily jerked up his head and
forced open his weary eyes an
agony of pain crawled slowly across
his face as he squinted through a
chink in the rough walls of his bar-
ricade

  every breath was torment every
movement a living hell

  six hours back sayers could have
picked up a three hundred pound
stone and walked away with it

 now he was paralyzed from the
waist down due to a heathen bullet

which had scraped across his spine

 lovingly he patted the rifle by
his side grinned like a fiend and
wrenched his head around in a sweat
of agony to face his partner whc held
the adjoining side of the barricade

 not long now old man he
grated theyll charge with dark-
ness

  the other grunted spat disdain-
fully

  and theyll eat plenty of lead be-
fore we go

pete sayers and larry moni-
han had bucked the heathen chinee
for many years and now it seemed
that they would go out together still
fighting them behind them the trail
was red-red with blood before
them-but both men realized that
from that time on there would be no
more out trails for them the check-
ered career of their lives was com-




thrilling adventures

ing to an abrupt end at a nameless
spot in the nameless wastes of the
manchurian wilds

  what were they doing there that
was their business they had suc-
ceeded for a breathless moment
they had stood dazzled on the
threshold of a fortune now failure
bitter failure ending in death

  again the rifle barked its message
of death from behind the hummock
of sand six other mausers picked
up the venomous chorus and a bar-
rage of lead converged on the flimsy
barricade

  monihan grunted again spat
picked up his rifle leveled it and
aimed carefully sayers followed
suit putting sweat blood and agony
into his shooting

the room became heavy with
smoke the bitter acrid smoke of
gunfire for a half hour the em-
battled heathens spewed lead from
their rifles cutting away the flimsy
protection of the lean-to

  for a half hour behind the tot-
tering barricade two desperate
grimy men cursed and snarled over
the hot barrels of their stuttering
rifles nursing their few remaining
shells for sure shots at the blurred
moving figures outside

  hell broke loose from the dunes
again as the chinese closed in on
the shack under the protection of a
heavy barrage bit by bit their heavy
slugs chewed away the shelter by the
pine tree it was only a matter of
time now-and lead

  still the two men fought on grim-
ly sardonically

  it was some ten years before that
pete sayers and larry monihan had
first set foot in that desolate land on
a search that had seemed almost fan-
tastic unreal ten long years of
bitter struggle that had brought them
close together made brothers of

them for only men who face the
rest of the world in opposition can
form a tie deeper than that of blood
side by side they had fought white
and yellow men alike and now it
seemed they would go out together
still fighting

  looks like the yellow devils are
going to get us at last snarled say-
ers as he hastily reloaded

 well see a bunch of them in
hell then answered monihan philo-
sophically for were sure going
there tonight

the bark of the guns outside rose
to a taccato roar as a fresh on-
slaught of screaming lead raked
down upon them sayers crept to
the shattered window of the hut
squinted down the barrel of his gun
spat flame three times and then stag-
gered back on to the floor

  got me larry he panted as
monihan crawled across the floor to
him lung and as he spoke a
froth of crimson bubbles welled up
to his lips if you make it-remem-
ber my girl

  and thus pete sayers in the arms
of his pal cast a last glance through
the doorway at the rapidly darken-
ing manchurian plain mouthed a
tortured oath and died

  some fifteen minutes later a slant-
eyed tattered figure peered through
the splintered doorway of the hut
he raised his voice in a high-pitched
alarm that brought his comrades on
the run in a huddled heap below
the window lay all that was mortal
of pete sayers but the other white
man was gone

  a mile away hidden in the slums
of harbin larry monihan stretched
his long limbs and picked feebly at
the silken covers of the couch on
which he was lying he looked with
glazed eyes up into the opaque black
orbs that stared down at him moni-
manchuria treasure



han was dying and he knew it he
managed a feeble smile

  wo sin he gasped and every
word was an effort youre what i
call a white man-youre a square
shooter listen-they got sayers i
stayed with him till my shells gave
out-then i crawled away lord
knows why they didnt run into me-
and finish me off but i made it
im going out though i know it
youre the only friend i got in this
god-forsaken country wo sin i
want you to promise me something
before i die

  he peered anxiously up into the
impassive yellow face above him saw
it nod in agreement

  take care of my son wo sin
and sayers girl shes in the states
-but shell be back some day i
promised him see and youll have to
take over the promise

  wo sin nodded gravely

  i shall do all i can my friend
i give you my word

monihan sank back on the
cushions satisfied his eyes
closed but a second later he opened
them again

  one more thing wo sin he
panted he raised a feeble hand and
tugged at the bosom of his ragged
blood-stained shirt we got it hid
out this tells where its for
young pete-give it to him when he
grows up tell him the whole story
then

  a shudder shook him violently
from head to foot and a spasm of
pain twitched his features

  so long wo sin youre-i-twin
-tat

  but he never finished the jumbled
sentence

  he was an hour late already for
his appointment with his friend pete
sayers-and he was going to meet
him

chapter i
the chart

when wo sin had promised
to accept the trust reposed
in him by larry monihan
he knew full well that he had un-
dertaken a perilous task he was
well aware of the identity of the
yellow-skinned men who had sent his
two american friends to their deaths
-secret agents working for the de-
posed emperor pu-yi

  well-known as a staunch friend of
the republic wo sin had no illu-
sions as to what would be his fate
should he himself fall into their
hands and he also realized that he
had small hope of escaping them

  they got wo sin all right but
that was all they did get he had
given his word and he kept it he
faced his accusers with unblinking
black eyes and no word crossed his
thin tight lips for five long years
the ageless chinaman endured his
punishment

  every means known to a race that
had perfected the arts of loosening
stubborn tongues was applied to him
wo sins dull eyes acquired expres-
sion-they transformed slowly into
twin agate balls of glowing hate but
his lips remained sealed

  he was a bitter silent man when
he emerged at last unshaken from
his ordeal emaciated scarred wo
sin made his way once more to his
native hongkong and resumed once
more his life as a wealthy scholar
surrounded by his friends and his
books

  for long years he kept a fatherly
eye on the growing son of his friend
larry monihan and the boy re-
vered him as a wise and gentle foster
father

  to young pete monihan life was
simple enough-almost too simple
once out of school he found no diffi-
culty in obtaining a position with an


thrilling adventures

american oil company but long
hours sitting cramped behind a desk
were trying to his excitement-loving
soul he would spend long hours
in the office day-dreaming of the one
thing that promised adventure galore

  wo sin had told him of his father
had given him vague hints that at
the time he should reach his major-
ity he would come into possession
of a wonderful glamorous secret

  wo sin himself was getting old
he remained almost in retirement
among his books but he managed
to keep his finger on the pulse of in-
ternational events and the results
were disquieting

  he was troubled and later happen-
ings only served to bear out his fore-
bodings he shook his venerable
head solemnly as he read of the
japanese invasion of manchuria of
the capture of harbin and of the
fighting at shanghai

the day came when wo sin en-
throned in his luxurious library
accepted a glass of samshu from his
faithful servant sipped it slowly
and then waved a hand in dismissal

alone-it is important the man
nodded his head and glided silently
toward the door and when the
young white man comes went on
wo sin send him in to me

  as the servant bowed and disap-
peared wo sin set down his glass
and walked stiffly across the room
from his blouse he extracted a tiny
gold key and inserted it in the lock
of a carved teakwood cabinet that
stood against the brocaded panel on
the wall the door of the cabinet
swung open and from within its re-
cess wo sin withdrew a packet
wrapped in crimson silk

  with long deft saffron fingers he
unwrapped the bulky parcel and ex-
tracted from its folds a large en-
velope three red seals yellowed

with the passage of time empha-
sized its importance and on the
face of the envelope in a bold firm
hand was written

  for wo sin to be opened on
march  

  impassively wo sin looked down
at the mysterious parcel whose safe-
keeping had meant five long years of
the tortures of hell for him uncon-
sciously he reached up a frail hand
and stroked the long scar that
stretched from the corner of one
oblique eye to the very edge of his
thin lips

  slowly he crossed the room picked
up an ornate paper knife and in-
serted its long thin blade beneath
the seals

carefully he withdrew a dingy
sheet of foolscap and a rough
parchment chart he seated himself
before his writing desk and spread
them out before him with beady
eyes he scanned the map that was
sketched on the parchment then he
picked up the letter and read it
slowly

  wo sin-my friend

   because i know your word is
  as good as your life i encrust
  this chart to you give it to my
  boy pete take care of him
  when you open this letter tell
  him the whole story dont for-
  get sayers girl either-he cant
  get the treasure without her im
  not telling him how to get it-
  but if he is as smart as a son of
  mine should be hell find out

good-by my friend

                larry monihan

  wo sin turned from the note and
pondered once more over the chart
here in his hand he held the clue
to a fortune the fortune that he had
held in trust for the son of larry
monihan

  and tonight he would turn it over
manchuria treasure



to the boy for this moment he had
suffered those bitter terrible five
years but he had kept his faith
and his promise would be fulfilled to
the letter

 only one thing troubled him-
sayers girl she was in hongkong
that much he knew but where

  his meditation was cut short by
the sound of a footstep outside
softly wo sin drew the crimson
silk over the papers on his desk and
turned to greet his visitor

  the embroidered curtains in the
doorway parted and wo sins eyes
brightened as he gazed at the tall
well-built young man who strode into
the room

  you are like your father he
said would that he could sec you
for he could well be proud to cail
you son

  thanks wo sin laughed pete
i wish i had known him he must
have been a real man from what you
tell me

  i prized his friendship as one of
my most valued possessions said
wo sin softly lapsing for a moment
into thoughts of the past

monihan watched him for a
moment before he spoke again
whats up he asked at last you
sent for me

  it is the sixth of march an-
swered wo sin you have not for-
gotten

  monihans face lit up well ill
be   i did forget can you imagine
that after me dreaming all these
years about    tell me the story wo
sin

 the old chinaman nodded he
picked up a long-stemmed pipe and
replenished its tiny bowl from a por-
celain jar of tobacco when it was
drawing well he settled himself com-
fortably and then looked at monihan

 you know what brought your
father and sayers to the orient

  monihan shook his head i dont
know much but it was something
worth plenty of money wasnt it

  money repeated wo sin yes
but worth more than money listen
one of the treasures of the manchu
dynasty was a priceless headdress
it is old incredibly old it is made
of purest gold and inlaid with gems
worth a kings ransom

dut it is worth far more than the
-l intrinsic value of the jewels and
the precious metals it contains it is
a symbol of power of the sacred
power of the dragon throne once
out of the hands of the manchu rul-
ers they lose face you begin to
understand

  monihan nodded but did not in-
terrupt

  during the time that the dragon
throne ruled the empire the head-
dress was stolen there was conster-
nation in the court they dared not
let the news of the vandalism become
public but the secret agents of the
emperor sought the stolen treasure
through the length and breadth of
the empire

 then came the revolution-and
now both sides sought frantically for
the sacred symbol of power some-
how somewhere your father and his
friend sayers came across a clue to
its hiding place they found it
though the agents of the deposed
manchu ruler and those of the re-
public dogged their very footsteps
harassed beset on all sides those
two found a safe hiding place for
their loot

  then with the agents of the re-
public at their heels they fled to
manchuria only to run into the
hands of the manchus there they
made their last stand and there say-
ers died your father escaped
wounded he lived long enough to
reach me

  i promised to look out for you


thrilling adventures

and upon your coming of age to
deliver you the treasure map you
are twenty-one today i have kept
my word though it cost me much
sorrow and pain again wo sins
thin finger traced the length of the
scar across his saffron cheek

  monihan whistled what a story
and you got the map well looks
like all ive got to do is go out and
help myself to all that wealth eh

  wo sin permitted himself a faint
smile then his face sobered

would it were as simple as that
my son but it is not so the
vandals who stole the dragon head-
dress from the vaults of the emperor
perished before they could reap the
harvest of gold as a reward for their
audacity and their courage your
father and his friend also found the
trail of the treasure a bloody one
he shook his head sadly and i fear
more blood will be spilled before you
hold the coveted diadem in your
hands

  but pete monihan was young and
his enthusiasm was not to be
quenched by vo sins solemn
prophecy

  it shouldnt be so hard to get
he protested with that map-

  i admire your courage my son
interrupted wo sin and your en-
thusiasm which is the heritage of
youth but do not disregard my
warning thus lightly remember this
-if the dragon headdress was of
great value politically at the time it
was in your fathers possession it is
doubly so now

  the japanese with the support of
the white russians have installed
pu-yi as ruler of the new manchu-
rian state the possession of the
manchu symbol would be of measure-
less value to them for that reason
the emissaries of the republic will
redouble their efforts to secure the
coveted prize

  they would gladly destroy your
life if it led to the destruction of
the headdress you are but a pawn
in the game of international intrigue
my son and as such you will be re-
moved with little compunction by
either side should it be to their
advantage

  the tone of vo sins voice even
more than the actual words he
spoke sobered monihan considerably

  i understand wo sin he nod-
ded but im going through with
it give me all the information that
you can

  assuredly answered wo sin
all i know and gladly your father
had a double trust-he had given his
word to sayers that he would take
care of his friends daughter the
treasure is your heritage to be di-
vided equally between you and this
map alone is valueless

   you will need the girl to solve its
meaning there is only one more
thing i can tell you that may be of
use-as your father died in my arms
he spoke a few disconnected words
he said twin tattoo i believe but
i could not be certain for his life
was ebbing fast and his voice was a
mere whisper

mvin tattoo repeated monihan
-l i guess he meant the tattoo mark
on my arm wo sin ive often won-
dered about it-i cant make it out
cant understand what the picture is
supposed to be but what did he
mean by twin tattoo

  thrt i do not know answered
the chinaman unless by chance it
concerns the girl

  where is she now asked moni-
han

  wo sin blinked through the haze
of blue tobacco smoke

  she is in shanghai that much
i know he replied but i am
afraid i have not been able to live
up strictly to my prorois i have
manchuria treasure



tried to find her but i believe she
has fallen into strange hands i
trust that i am mistaken but i fear
that someone has learned the fact
that she holds half the secret to the
treasure

  you mean-you think somebodys
holding her so that they will be
able to get their hands on the stuff
said pete that makes it difficult
wo sin weve got to find the
kid

  she is no child said wo sin
if she is alive she is almost your
age

  monihan grunted that makes it
even harder

  they both lasped into silence for
a moment then wo sin removed
the crimson silk covering and beck-
oned to monihan pete bent over the
desk and hastily read through the
contents of the letter then he
pored over the chart with eager eyes

  it looks to me like one of the
islands off macao he said at last

  i believe you are right answered
the chinaman i know that your
father and sayers fled there when
the pursuit was closing in on them
monihan straightened up well
wo sin theres nothing for it but
to find that girl im going down to
the metropole and find red corri-
gan he knows every girl in hong-
kong or at least he boasts that way
if anybody knows of her where-
abouts itll be red

  and the chart

  keep it for me wo sin ill be
back

        chapter ii
        death strikes

a hour passed-two hours wo
sin sat in his library star-
ing with expressionless eyes
at the chart on the table suddenly
his gaunt body tensed-he felt that
he was being watched he sat rigid

and strained his ears nothing
nothing stirred in the room but the
silken draperies at the windows as
the night breeze rustled their folds
but still the feeling persisted

  he tried to shrug it off and turned
again to his papers he was getting
old getting nervous the day was
soon to arrive when he would meet
his honorable ancestors

  for a fleeting second a face ap-
peared in the dark rectangle of the
window behind him but wo sin was
completely immersed in the chart
again from outside came the mystic
noises of the night-nothing else

  then so softly and swiftly that
he was but a blacker smudge in
the shadows of the room a man
slipped through the opening the
draperies waved as his bulk thrust
them outward and once more wo
sin held his breath his claw-like
hand crept across the table but he
never completed the movement

  you will sit still said a voice
behind him

deliberately slowly t h e
chinaman turned -to face the
owner of that voice his beady eyes
fastened on the gaping muzzle of a
revolver aimed at his heart then
slowly they traveled upward and
came to rest on a broad swarthy
bearded face

  you came to see me asked wo
sin

  yes wo sin answered the other
in a guttural voice

  you know me i see said the
chinaman and i know you ivan
klementoff yes my friend i know
you but i cannot say that i am
glad to welcome you in my house
were the chinese government less
harassed by the menace of shanghai
i feel sure they would take the
trouble to ensconce you safely be-
hind the bars of a prison cell you
are a dangerous man klementoff-


thrilling adventures

a dangerous man at large in war-
torn china

  the russian grinned displaying
white teeth through his touseled
beard he executed a smart cossack
salute

 a great tribute wo sin for
which i thank you now that you
know me it makes it very much
easier you understand what i have
come for

  wo sins hands stole behind him
the bony fingers of his left hand
closed convulsively over the parch-
ment

  he shook his head

  i am sorry but i do not under-
stand what is it that ivan klemen-
toff seeks in the house of wo sin
surely not my books-the wisdom of
the great confucius would mean
nothing to the eyes of a cossack

klementoff stepped closer
no old one i do not search for
wisdom i search for treasure i wish
the chart that holds the secret of the
dragon headdress you will give
it to me

  wo sins right hand found what
it was seeking it closed over the
handle of the long-bladed paper
knife with which he had opened the
envelope that held the map he
gazed unblinkingly into the gaping
muzzle of the gun in klementoffs
hand

  slowly he drew forward his left
hand clutching the map the
cossacks eyes glittered beneath his
shaggy eyebrows and he took another
step forvard his hand outstretched to
grasp the precious document

  but even as his fingertips brushed
the parchment wo sins right hand
flashed up the long sharp blade
of the paper knife glittered evilly
in the light

  a low animal-iike snarl escaped
the russians twisted lips as he

dodged the blow the hand that had
sought to grasp the chart snaked
through the air and closed in a
frantic hold on the thin claw-like
wrist of wo sins knife hand

  exerting every muscle in his huge
powerful body klementoff jerked
violently wo sins breath hissed
through his tight lips then the
knife flew from his limp fingers and
whirled in a flashing arc to the
carpet beneath

  fool spat the cossack you
are too old wo sin to battle with
me the time has come for you to-
die

  even as the last word rang out
in the room klementoffs thick
finger clenched convulsively on the
trigger of his revolver the gun
barked out once-twice

  wo sins mangled hand crept up
to where a rapidly widening stain
of crimson oozed across his blouse
his beady eyes flashed deadly hate
at his enemy then slowly they
glazed over

  his thin shoulders sagged and his
knees buckled then he slumped to
the carpet

 fron somewhere in the house
sounded voices-a shrill high-pitched
flow of cantonese and a deeper
voice a strange one cursing under
his beard the cossack stooped swift-
ly over the emaciated lifeless body
at his feet with desperate haste he
snatched at the chart but even in
death wo sin retained his vise-like
grip on the document

heavy footsteps pounded toward
the room frantically klementoff
tugged at the chart the aged and
brittle parchment gave way beneath
the strain rent in two one half
still remained in the clenched hand
of wo sin grasping the other the
cossack raced across the room and
disappeared as he had come through
the window
manchuria treasure



chapter iii

the fight

wo sin was buried with all
the pomp and glory of a red
button mandarin white
men and yellow men alike joined in
the elaborate ceremonies and with
deep regret over his passing escorted
him to the grave of his ancestors

  but none grieved more sincerely
over the tragedy than young pete
monihan in lonely silence his eyes
glittering with unshed tears he per-
formed the rites expected of a
dutiful and filial son

  he did not open his lips until he
was ensconced once more in his
room at the metropole there with
red corrigan and tom harden his
pals from the office he broke down
and wept

  the passing of wo sin had filled
him with a terrible feeling of lone-
liness no more would the kindly
old chinaman watch out over his
doings no more would brief softly-
spoken words impart to him some of
the great store of wisdom that had
been gathered behind wo sins
beady black eyes

  he was on his own now he was
-pete monihan sat up straight on
the bed where he had flung himself
-he was twenty-one he was a man
now

 avoiding the commiserating
glances of his friends monihan
hastily wiped the back of his sleeve
across his reddened eyes his shoul-
ders straightened squared back and
his jaw set firmly then he turned
to face his friends

  well pete its all over said
harden better forget it-theres
work to be done

  tom answered monihan bitterly
you said plenty just then there
is work for me

 and for us too spoke up
corrigan  were with you

  monihan scowled at the toes of
his shoes listen whoever killed
wo sin was there just before i
reached the room when i get
him-

 when we get him amended
corrigan wo sin was a white man
pete youre counting us in on this
understand

  better have a drink suggested
harden crossing the room he found
a bottle and some glasses on the
bureau and proceeded to pour out
three stiff drinks here he handed
one to monihan itll steady your
nerves a bit guess we can all
stand a shot

  they drank in silence

  well ventured harden at last
have you got any ideas

  as to who killed him asked
monihan no it could have been
any one of thousands i guess but
the treasure is back of it if we start
looking for it and get hot the man
who murdered wo sin is sure to
turn up

  right agreed corrigan and
the first thing to do is find the girl

monihan strode restlessly up
and down the room his eyes
were hard and bitter and his once
laughing mouth was a cruel narrow
line

  the hell of it is he grunted
i told wo sin to hold that chart
for me i should have taken it when
he offered the damn thing to me
if he hadnt had it maybe-
forget it counseled corrigan
we all have to go sometime wo
sin isnt sorry wherever he is
where have you got your half
asked harden

  monihan slapped his breast right
here if anyone wants it theyll have
to kill me first

  with the words he drew from his
pocket a long blued-steel smith and
wesson  with a flick of his


thrilling adventures

wrist he snapped out the chamber
and carefully examined each shell
then satisfied he pocketed the gun
once more

  you two sit tight he ordered
im going for a walk ive got to
do some thinking and maybe the air
will clear my head a bit

  corrigan bounced from his chair
good well trail along

  he reached for his hat but moni-
han stopped him nothing doing
you two wait here i have to be
alone

  despite the protests of his com-
panions he was firm he left the
hotel and with unseeing eyes joined
the throng that shuffled through the
streets

 a motley stream of passers-by
jostled his elbows and a dozen for-
eign tongues dinned into his unheed-
ing ears but monihans mind was
a tumult of bitter thoughts and he
wandered aimlessly down the thor-
oughfare

  his eagerness to find the heritage
his father had left him was tempered
and yet strengthened by the murder
of his chinese foster father his
unknown enemies were not mere
obstacles in the way of his search
but the object of a bitter personal
hatred that welled up in his heart

  solemnly he dedicated his own life
to the avenging of wo sins brutal
murder

his unthinking steps had taken
him away from the wide thor-
oughfares ofthe foreign concession
ever deeper into the slums of the
native quarters the streets were
narrow shabby crooked alleys ram-
shackle flimsy houses leaning craz-
ily against each other flaunted long
vertical signs in faded vermilion and
yellow

 with a start monihans mind
jerked back to reality a padded
but insistent footstep behind him

beat into his consciousness all his
nerves and senses became alert

  now that he had noticed the fact
he realized that he had been dimly
aware of the soft footfalls for some
time past hastily he lengthened his
stride and his right hand crept to-
ward his hip

  but the steps behind him speeded
up to match his own

monihan cursed softly beneath
his breath he swung abruptly
around the next corner and took three
swift strides forward then he
brought up to a sudden halt he
peered through the shadows and real-
ized that he had turned into a blind
alley fool

  no chance to use his gun here-
his hand dropped away from his hip
one shot and the ramshackle houses
would erupt a horde of yellow-
skinned men-and a lone white man
in the torturous maze of the native
quarter could look for no assistance
from the yellow pack

 monihan whirled about fists
clenched just in time to avoid a
murderous blow swung at his head
he side-stepped and swung up his
arm to catch the force of the un-
wieldy weapon on his forearm

  as his attacker lunged past him
monihan caught him with a stiff
right flush to the chin a grunt and
a curse from the thug and the fight
was on the shadowy alley echoed
and reechoed to the sound of blows

 monihan had counted on only
one enemy but instead he found
himself surrounded by four of his
attackers a hail of stinging blows
landed on his chin and he staggered
back

  there was only one thing in his
favor he realized and that was
that his unknown antagonists were
no more anxioub than he was to
rouse the neighborhood it was that
fact pete knew that had saved him
manchuria treasure



from a swift merciless leaden slug
in the stomach

  a surge of savage anger impelled
him forward and he shot out his
heavy fists with lightning precision
he grunted with satisfaction as the
impact of his knuckles on yielding
flesh brought low moans of pain
from his adversaries

  the four thugs shouldered to-
gether and crowded him back against
the wall pete swung with his left
and brought his knee up with the
blow he followed the thrust with
a crashing right to a chin that
bobbed in front of him he ducked
as a fist swished past his ear but
hard knuckles scraped across his
forehead and raked the skin above
his eye

a thin trickle of blood seeped
down his cheek and crept salty
to the corner of his grim set mouth
once more he swung his knee and
his fist in simultaneous action and
the man nearest him reeled back
sprawling he blocked the rest of
monihans attackers for a moment

  monihan leaned back against the
wall and gasped for breath the air
whistled from his tortured lungs in
great sobs then they were on him
again

  monihan knew he was a beaten
man but he determined to go out
fighting heavy fists smashed into
his head and neck and his own arms
grew tired as he retaliated a right
to the ear sent him crashing back-
ward again he reeled crazily
stumbled caught himself up again
and swung out blindly a jutting
chin collided with his battered
knuckles and the man went down in
a heap

  but monihan knew it couldnt last
much longer he steadied himself
for a last stand he dropped another
with a cruel right to the heart then
the last two rushed him as one

monihan was weary and his head
swam

  a kaleidoscope of blazing lights
flashed before his eyes as he ham-
mered away almost unconsciously
instinctively at his two attackers a
heavy bludgeon crashed down on his
shoulder and sent fiery jabs of pain
through the numbed muscles of his
arm

  slowiy foot by foot by their
superior weight they forced moni-
hans back to the wall his foot
slipped in his own blood and he
went down the men piling over him
with the strength of desperation he
fought his way once more to his
feet

 in a rush of savage fury he
slashed out wildly but pete knew
that his blows lacked steam blood
ran from the cut over his eye only
the thought of the murdered wo
sin who had died to pass on this
dangerous heritage to him gave him
renewed strength to fight on

  it was but a matter of minutes
seconds then-

  hold em pete rang out from
the mouth of the alley here i
come 

  a hysterical desire to laugh grip-
ped monihan never before had
corrigans voice sounded so sweet
in his ears

with the battle cry still on his
lips red smashed his way into
the fray under the mighty power
of his crushing blows the four men
fell back this was evidently more
than they had counted on and bat-
tered and bleeding from monihans
desperate fighting they broke ranks
in confusion

  as suddenly as the fight had start-
ed it was over the cowardly at-
tackers turned tail and fled monihan
placed a weary hand on the wall to
steady himself and passed his fingers
tenderly over his bleeding forehead


thrilling adventures

  thanks red he panted you
just made it in time-they had me
finished

   yellow dogs grunted corrigan
breathing on his bruised knuckles

  did you get a good look at
them asked monihan it was so
dark in here and after the fireworks
started i could only see sky rockets
and pin wheels i couldnt make
them out

  i sized them up as they lit out
said corrigan they belong to
klementoffs outfit-japs but one
of them unless im crazy looked
like his son

  thats funny mused monihan
 old ivan thinks the world of that
hell-raising kid nick it doesnt
seem logical that hed send him out
on this back alley stuff

  corrigan shrugged his shoulders

  probably klementoff doesnt
know that nick trailed along hes
a mean young devil and he most
likely wanted to have the pleasure
of helping to finish you off he
passed an arm through monihans
lets get going tomll be getting
uneasy

they walked down the shadowy
length of the alley and emerged
on the narrow street almond eyes
stared after them curiously as they
headed for the british city once
more

  corrigan hailed a ricksha coolie
and they piled into the dilapidated
vehicle red gave the driver sing-
songed orders and he nodded then
they were off at a rapid pace

  back in monihans room at the
metropole harden looked at them
curiously monihan let corrigan ex-
plain as he carefully washed his
wounds

  by the way he called over his
shoulder how did you happen to
be down that alley red

  corrigan fidgeted uneasily in his

chair well you see its this
way    he began but pete inter-
rupted him

  you followed me eh thought i
couldnt take carc of myself

  aw   

  its a damn good thing for me
you did grinned monihan let
go downstairs dinners on me-you
earned it

he ran a comb through his tousel-
ed hair slipped into his coat and
led the way they clattered down
the stairs and made their way into
the dining room on the main floor
of the hotel

  a sleek white-jacketed waiter
placed menus before them corrigan
waved his hand at the card

  bring food-any kind and plenty
of it he ordered were all starved
hurry now

  as the grinning waiter hurried
off kitchenwards the trio got down
once more to the business in hand

  it looks to me offered harden
from reds story that klementoff
is working this on his own i think
hes the only one who knows you
have half the map if the chinese
government knew as much youd
have heard from them by now the
japs may be backing klementoff but
apparently hes having a free hand
in the recovery of the headdress

  thats good news if your hunch
is right answered monihan that
means we have only one man to
look out for and somebody we knew
at that

  say interrupted corrigan jog-
ging his elbow look what just
came into the room will you a
swell looker too

  you and women grunted moni-
han screwing around in his chair
you forget everything else on your
mind when a skirt swishes past you
he surveyed the newcomers critical-
ly shes not bad at that though
manchuria treasure



he offered but i cant say i like
the looks of her boy friend

  as if she knew that she was the
subject of their conversation the
slim blonde turned her head and
met monihans direct gaze she
flushed prettily then managed a
faint smile in his direction as her
escort steered her to a table

  harden scowled thoughtfully at
her swarthy-skinned escort

  ive seen that man some place be-
fore he mumbled i wish i could
remember just where and when

  forget him suggested corrigan
heres the grub ill find out who
he is for you ill ask the girl
friend

 quick worker eh laughed
monihan

  sure boasted corrigan ill
bring her around for dinner to-
morrow ive seen her havent i
thats enough for me

 by the time they had finished
their coffee and had lit up cigarettes
they had carefully gone over the
entire history of the hidden treasure

  lets go up to your room pete
suggested corrigan and well go
over the chart together

chapter iv

the twin tattoos

monihan led the way down
the corridor turned the
key in the lock of his door
and felt for the light switch on the
wall he snapped it on but the room
remained dark

  thats funny-lights gone bad
he muttered

  maybe grunted corrigan his
hand crept toward his hip take
it easy tom keep an eye on the
door

  cautiously their guns ready they
felt their way into the room satis-
fied that it was empty monihan
struck a match and guided by its

flare approached the light bracket
on the wall he felt the bulb and
found it loose in its socket he gave
it a few turns and the light went
on

  corrigan and harden followed suit
and found each bulb had likewise
been loosened

  under the full glow of the lamps
they stared aghast at the room it
was hardly recognizable bureau
drawers had been pulled out and
emptied carelessly upon the carpet
a litter of papers and letters strew-
ed the table the bed had been
roughly torn apart and the tumbled
bedclothing hung trailing over the
footboard

  nothing had escaped the confu-
sion every article of furniture in
the room had been subjected to a
thorough search

monihan smothered a curse
then patted his breast pocket
and grinned he would have enjoyed
seeing the baffled faces of the men
who had failed in their search

 thorough job he commented
dryly

 but you got the map on you
asked harden anxiously

  i sure have answered monihan
he crossed the room and snapped
the lock on the door and if any-
body else comes searching theyre
going to run into a lot of grief

  without bothering to straighten
up the littered room the trio drew
up chairs and gathered about the
table monihan drew out the torn
chart and passed it over to corrigan
harden leaned over reds shoulder
as they eagerly scanned the coveted
parchment

  its some island off macao thats
all i know said monihan just
what its name is i dont know
probably hasnt got one it might
not be anything more than a sandbar
but we can go ahead with that


thrilling adventures

well have to cruise around a bit
and take a chance on beating kle-
mentoff there

  after the two men had satisfied
their curiosity somewhat he went
on first thing to do is find sayers
girl from what wo sin told me
we have to get hold of her before
we can find the loot

  suppose said harden slowly
suppose that she is working against
us suppose shes tied up with who-
ever it was that got wo sin and
theyre trying to get the headdress
themselves

  a dark scowl crossed monihans
face ive thought of that tom if
she was responsible for wo sins
murder-ill ram the dragon head-
dress down her throat she can keep
it that way

  and ill help you do it dame
or no dame grunted corrigan

  good answered monihan now
i vote we go down to see old man
hawkins tomorrow and charter a boat
from him i think he has a line on
several british and american boats
that are out for charter you tom
can sign on with the crew and trail
along then ill take the regular
steamer to macao alone

  why alone objected corrigan
unwilling to be left out of it

   youll have to trail along later
explained monihan klementoff will
be watching us and if we all start
off together itll be a dead give-
away

corrigan grumbled but in the
end he was forced to acknowl-
edge the wisdom of monihans plan
after making arrangements for the
morrow corrigan and harden rose
to leave for their own rooms at the
door harden stopped suddenly with
his hand on the knob

  i got it-i just remembered he
burst out

  got what-rhythm mocked cor-
rigan

  no-i mean i remember who that
man was you know-the one with
the blonde down in the dining room
you better watch your step when
you start making a play for the girl
friend red

  hows that

  hes one of klementoffs outfit
thats all

  left alone monihan settled him-
self in a comfortable chair and
scowled moodily at the opposite wall
so the blonde had flashed him a
smile eh they thought they would
get to him in that way his lip
curled a bitter smile

  it was a good thing a damn good
thing that hardens memory for
faces had warned him in time for
she had been a delicious little bit
of femininity monihan didnt try
to fool himself if it had not been
for hardens timely tip he would
have been fair game for her golden
beauty

  for the hundredth time he studied
the rude outlines of the map then a
discreet tap at his door stiffened him
in his chair hastily he stuffed the
chart and the letter into his coat
pocket and then crossed the room on
tiptoe

then with his hand on his hip
he grasped the doorknob and
flung it wide in a sudden movement

  for a moment he stood staring
open-mouthed at his visitor then
he recovered his composure it was
the piquant blonde of the dining
room

  may i come in she whispered

  of course answered monihan
grinning widely walk right in and
make yourself at home

  if there was anything sarcastic in
his tone the girl apparently did not
notice it she meekly accepted the
chair he drew up for her and watch-
manchuria treasure



ed him from wide innocent eyes as
he hitched his own closer

  then she glanced about the room
and her fingers twitched slightly
it was evidently hard to stifle the
desire to put the room to rights a
true feminine instinct but instead
she asked

  your friends-where are they
in their own rooms he answered
why

  youre americans she said so
am i im in trouble-terrible
trouble i thought   

  uh huh go on urged monihan
i dont know where to start she
evaded oh its been awful i-
i- im afraid
she leaned forward impulsively
pillowed her face on his shoulder
and sobbed unconsciously monihan
slid a solicitous arm about her shak-
ing shoulders

  now now he murmured dont
cry-thats a good girl everythingll
be    why you little hellcat
he suddenly snarled his hand shot
out and closed about her wrist her
fist came up out of his pocket still
clutching the map so thats your
game eh well you made a mistake
i expected just this

  the girl hung her head for an in-
stant ashamed that she had been
caught rather than of the game she
was up to monihan dug his fingers
cruelly into her wrist and she
winced

 whats your name he de-
manded

 margy she answered margy
sanders

  so youre one of klementoffs
outfit eh he went on

her silence was an admission of
the fact the thought that the
girl might have been responsible for
wo sins death fanned the dull
anger that burned in monihans
breast fanned the embers into

flaming hate with an angry gesture
he pushed her violently from him

  margy fell back into the chair and
a matching hate flashed from her
eyes with a cunning twist of her
arm she broke from his grasp and
snatched at her bosom but even as
she brought a tiny  automatic to
light monihan pinned her wrist
again

  for a moment they struggled furi-
ously and the girl fought tooth and
nail clawing like a wildcat just as
monihan wrenched the gun away
from her the entire right sleeve of
her dress ripped loose under his
fingers

  say he gasped pointing at her
arm whats that

margy looked down at the
curious tattoo mark on her firm
white skin

  what do you think it is she
countered sullenly

  sit down snapped monihan he
pushed her back into the chair again
im sorry i hurt you i want to
talk to you

  youve got a rough way of talk-
ing- grumbled the girl ruefully
rubbing her aching wrist

  i know but i didnt mean it
answered monihan ive been
touchy lately he watched her nar-
rowly as he spoke ever since a-
a friend of mine was killed

  but if he expected to make her
start margy disappointed him she
merely gazed at him in sullen si-
lence

  youre a game kid continued
monihan listen-you said your
name was margy sanders eh was
it ever-sayers he shot out sud-
denly

  the girl looked startled sure
thats my real name klementoff
made me change it

 without another word monihan
ripped off his coat rolled up his


thrilling adventures

sleeve and displayed a tattoo mark
almost identical with the one on her
own arm then when she had some-
what gotten over the shock of the
revelation he showed her his fathers
letter he was open and above
board and told her all he knew of
the hidden treasure of the manchus

  thats the story margy he
finished now tell me how you feel
about it

  margy squinted thoughtfully at
the floor

  i thought there was something
queer about klementoff she said
now i know i dont know if hes
the man who killed wo sin but you
can bet hes mixed up in it some-
place hes smart though pete
itll be hard to prove anything on
him

well if i can find out to my
own satisfaction that he mur-
dered wo sin hes a dead man ive
given you my cards straight if you
want to see this through with me
fine if you dont   

  margy met his gaze squarely and
held out a slim hand

  if you trust me pete im going
with you-all the way your father
and mine were friends they hoped
wed be friends too

  monihan crushed her cool hand in
his own margy when this is all
over ill tell you what i thought of
you when i first saw you down-
stairs he raised her firm chin with
the tip of one finger then with an
impulsive movement bent down and
covered her lips with his own

  a rosy flush crept slowly over the
girls cheeks she drew back and
her lips opened but before she could
speak for the second time that
evening a discreet rap sounded on
the door the pair froze

  then monihan with his fingers to
his lips indicated a closet on the far
side of the room with a flash of

twinkling spike heels margy tiptoed
to it and disappeared within its re-
cess

chapter v
klementoff shows his hand

  again the knock sounded moni-
han hastily donned his coat
x jm crossed to the door and
snapped it open with a swift glance
he surveyed the tall bearded man
who stood on the threshold

hello pete said his visitor

  h e   o klementoff answered
monihan coldly

  am i to be invited in asked the
kussian

  invited no but come in any-
way snapped monihan

  klementoff bowed his lips drawn
back in a mirthless grin above his
beard and stepped into the room
monihan watched him closely as he
took in the disorder about him the
cossack looked around the room in
dismay and his hands went up in a
gesture of question

  what is all this my friend he
asked

  i thought maybe youd explain it
insinuated monihan

  i i explain questioned kle-
mentoff

  the tone of surprise in his words
almost sounded genuine

  a worthy adversary thought pete
he would have his hands full outwit-
ting the russian and the more he
thought about it the more he was
convinced that klementoff was re-
sponsible for a far more terrible deed
than the ransacking of his room

  it looks went on the cossack
as though your belongings held
something of great interest-to some-
one papers a letter perhaps and
other things

get down to business snapped
monihan what brought you here
manchuria treasure



  klementoff hunched his broad
shoulders and spread his hands once
more such importance my friend
perhaps you were looking at the
chart even as i knocked upon the
door

  you   snarled monihan streak-
ing for his hip but the cossack
with an incredibly fast draw was be-
fore him and with his gun hand still
in the air monihan found himself
looking down the ugly black muzzle
of a heavy caliber revolver

easy my friend easy laughed
klementoff you are too impetu-
ous also you are too slow-with
your revolver you know of my repu-
tation with a gun do you not you
were foolish to attempt it

  the hot anger that flamed in moni-
hans heart choked his words to an
almost inaudible hiss

  klementoff he whispered if
you killed wo sin-ill get you
perhaps shrugged the cossack
but you may find it more difficult
than you expect i shall leave you
now but you will see me again take
good care of your health my friend
with a mocking bow the big rus-
sian strode to the door and was gone
without a thought for margy still
concealed in the closet monihan
grabbed his hat and raced off in pur-
suit down in the lobby he tarried
long enough to deposit the chart in
the hotel safe then he raced out
on to the veranda

  klementoffs big sedan pulled away
from the curb as he ran down the
steps monihan passed up the line
of ricksha coolies and roused the
sleepy driver of an ancient dilapi-
dated taxi

  follow that car he ordered as
he climbed inside and the chase was
on

  the chinaman at the wheel blink-
ed rapidly became suddenly wide
awake and flashed a wide row

of glistening teeth in an understand-
ing grin monihan held his breath
as the ancient vehicle honked its
way through the crowded streets a
tall bearded sikh policeman peered
suspiciously in at monihan as they
rattled by him but did not stop
their mad flight

  their destination soon became ap-
parent the big sedan ahead turned
up the road that led up the peak
monihan sat well forward on the
back seat of the taxi as they labored
up the winding road through beau-
tiful groves of palms past the
gardened villas of the resident brit-
ish officials

  his mind worked rapidly he knew
that klementoff had been after the
chart but why he had paid that little
social call was more than monihan
could figure out he was out to find
the answer

  they turned off down a palm-lined
driveway up ahead pete could see
the dark outlines of a two-story
house set well back among the trees
he barked a curt order to his driver
and the ancient hack rattled to a
halt

monihan tossed the grinning
chinaman a handful of coins and
waited until the dilapidated vehicle
was once more headed for the water-
front section then on foot he si-
lently crept up toward the house

 he ducked hastily behind the
cover of some shrubs as the sedans
headlights swung about and the car
swept past him on the driveway
then he emerged once more on to
the road and quickened his pace

  the building was dark ominously
silent monihan hesitated a moment
before descending the two short
steps that led to the low doorway
his caution told him that it was
folly to enter that dark secretive
entryway

  but the scent of his quarry spurred


thrilling adventures

him on on tiptoe he crept to the
doorway and leaning against it
pressed his ear to the jamb the
door gave at his slightest pressure

  that was too much-he could not
resist the invitation with a steady
hand he pushed the portal inward
it swung easily on well-oiled hinges
before him lay a long dark passage-
way faintly illuminated at the far
end by the diffused light that came
from an adjoining room

  monihans heart picked up a faster
rhythm as he crept down the car-
peted hall he reached the end of
the passageway without incident and
peered into the dimly-lit room that
gave off it on the right

there sitting in a chair with his
back to the door sat klementoff

  a rapid survey of the room showed
monihan that no one else was there
he hesitated for a second in the
shadows of the hall but his inde-
cision was immediately dispelled for
him the cossack spoke from his
chair without even turning his head

  come in mr monihan he said
in a casual tone

  there was no recourse but to obey
monihan was not going to turn back
now that he had come this far he
stepped boldly into the room and
klementoff turned in his chair

  you are quite prompt i see said
the russian and monihan noticed
that he had a thin gold watch in his
hairy hand

  i see you do not quite follow me
mentally continued klementoff
you see i have been expecting
you

  for the first time it dawned on
pete that he had walked into a trap

 you mean-

  exactly i knew you would fol-
low me i was very careful to make
sure that you did not lose sight of
my car why did you think that i
was so slow in leaving the hotel

  petes heart sank his only con-
solation he reflected was the fact
that he had taken the precaution to
deposit the chart in the office safe
though it was evident from klemen-
toffs smug satisfaction that he had
the situation well in hand monihan
decided to face it out

  pretty clever of you klementoff
he said i sure hand it to you
the russians lips curled in scorn
you are a mere child-a babe yet
you would match wits with me
bah he indicated a chair opposite
him sit down

  monihan shook his head im
standing

  as you will shrugged the cos-
sack i will be brief i want the
half of the chart which is in your
possession you will write a note to
your hotel directing them to turn it
over to the bearer

 monihans eyes narrowed so
klementoff hadnt missed that move
either but he said nothing

  come come continued the rus-
sian you would be foolish to re-
fuse my demand in your hand the
map spells nothing but death

an ironic smile twisted the cor-
ners of monihans mouth he was
well aware that the heritage his
father had left him was a perilous
one indeed but that was no reason
for young pete monihan to re-
linquish it so easily his chin set
stubbornly and he shook his head

  i know im in for a peck of
trouble but it doesnt make any
difference im going through with
it

  once more i ask you said the
cossack in a hard voice is it yes
or no

  no answered monihan promptly
and you can go to hell for all i
care

  imperceptibly klementoffb head
manchuria treasure



inclined in a nod monihan recog-
nized it as a signal he ducked and
side-stepped-but too late

  a heavy bludgeon descended with
murderous force on his skull
for a moment a blinding flash
of vivid crimson flashed before moni-
hans eyes then blackness utter
blackness he slumped to the floor
in an inert mass

  the tone of klementoffs voice
never varied as he addressed the
colossal chinaman who bent over the
body of his victim

  finish your task chang remem-
ber-acid no trace

  with a grunt to show that he un-
derstood the huge yellow man
stooped down and gathered moni-
hans body in his powerful arms
then carrying him as though he
were a child he left the room by
way of a concealed door in the rear
wall

  klementoff sank back in his chair
ran a thoughtful hand through his
beard and frowned at the floor

chapter vi

to the rescue

margy was not above lis-
tening in on monihans
conversation with the rus-
sian with her golden curls pressed
tightly to the jamb of the door she
managed to hear every word when
klementoff took his departure she
decided to play safe and wait a mo-
ment before she emerged from her
hiding place

  when the second slamming of the
door came to her ears she did not
know what to make of it she lis-
tened intently but heard no further
sounds from the room then in a
flash she realized what had happened
pete had followed klementoff

  she burst open the door of the
closet and tumbled out of the room
she raced down into the lobby

emerged breathless on the veranda
but it was too late

 for a moment margy was in a
quandary it was clear all too clear
to her then that the entire object of
klementoffs visit had been to get
monihan to follow him she had to
act and act fast back in the lobby
she scrawled a hasty note folded it
up and tugged the sleeve of one of
the white-jacketed china boys

  here she said thrusting a coin
into the boys hand take this to
the friends of mr monihan two
men-they live in the hotel you
know them

  margy hardly waited for the moon-
faced chinese to reply in the affirma-
tive she dashed once more out of
the hotel and climbed into a waiting
ricksha

like a sick babe in his arms
chang carried the unconscious
monihan through the secret door in
the wall and passed down a short
narrow blind passage with a heavy
foot he kicked at the closed door at
the far end and entered the room
beyond

  the room was broad and low its
walls were a dirty white a fresh
coat of whitewash having just re-
cently been applied at the far end
was a shallow pit sunk in the floor

  chang placed monihans limp fig-
ure on a steel table in the center of
the room under the one bright light
it was the only piece of furniture in
the room and the place was brutally
stark in its emptiness there was a
creepy suggestive sense of horror
about it under the brilliant unshaded
lamp

  a strong acrid distasteful odor
filled the room as the huge china-
man opened a cabinet in the wall re-
vealing shelf after shelf of dark blue
bottles he donned rubber gloves
first and then gingerly pulled the
corks from a few of the acid contain-


thrilling adventures

ers crossing the room he poured
their contents into the deathpit the
air was heavy and oppressive it
even gagged chang who was long
inured to it

  the pit prepared to his satisfac-
tion he returned to monihan and
calmly and unconcernedly as a
butcher slaughters a pig methodical-
ly went through his pockets watch
cuffs links collar buttons anything
that the acid would not eat was
carefully collected and placed in one
pile papers and letters in another

meanwhile margy leaped
down from the ricksha in front
of the dark gloomy villa she
pressed a handful of coppers into
the moist palm of her panting human
horse and then descended the two
short steps to the entrance

  with a beating heart but a steady
hand she gave the bell beside the
portal a peculiar ring in answer the
door swung silently open and a yel-
low face peered out at her

  where is klementoff she asked

  the chinaman pointed an eloquent
thumb down the hallway margys
heart sank she realized then that
she would have to bluff it out the
only way of reaching monihan was
through the room in which klemen-
toff was now sitting

  how she was going to get out of
there with pete she hadnt the
slightest idea

  she patted her blonde curls into
place felt at her breast for the cold
hard steel of her automatic and then
assuming a casual air she was far
from feeling she sauntered down the
hall

  it was customary to knock before
entering klementoffs room but
margy thought it would be a good
gesture to disregard that formality
humming a bar from a song she had
heard in a waterfront grog-shop she
pushed open the door and entered

  hello klementoff she called
innocently

  the big cossack surveyed her
slowly from head to foot you
have been-where he shot out

  margys eyes widened you mean
where have you been she countered
i looked all over the metropole for
you

  so answered klementoff and
did you meet with any success on
your-er-mission 

  none said the girl with as-
sumed disgust he suspected me
from the start he didnt believe a
word i told him

  bah snorted the russian you
should not have spoken women
need only to talk with their eyes-
women with figures like yours

margy placed her arms bellig-
erently akimbo is that so
well youve got me wrong i dont
do business that way and that
goes for you too she added hiding
her uneasiness over the strange light
that glittered in klementoffs eyes as
he fairly devoured her slim figure

  please do not get excited the
russian soothed her it does not
matter whether you have failed i
have the young man myself he
watched her closely to see the effect
of his words he is inside with
chang

  margy felt herself go sick at the
thought but with a strenuous effort
she kept her jumpy nerves under con-
trol

  with chang eh she said lightly
so that will be the finish of mr
monihan i guess thats the only
thing to do i must say you know
your business klementoff you
never fail-you always get what you
go out after

  you think so leered klementoff
i thank you perhaps you would
like to go in and see our friend
manchuria treasure



monihan before he is past recogni-
tion

  if klementoff had expected margy
to reveal her real feelings in the
matter he was disappointed she
took his ghastly suggestion at face
value it was just the opportunity
she had been waiting for

  not a bad idea at that i think i
will she answered his grim words
as if that way was as good as any to
kill a few idle minutes

  with a nod of her head and a smile
at the leering face of the big russian
she pressed the panel in the rear of
the room and disappeared through
the secret door

  once the trap had shut behind her
margys bearing changed completely
on the instant

  instead of a pert provocative
blonde she became a lean ferocious
pantheress all her assumed indiffer-
ence fell away as she snatched the
tiny automatic from her breast and
with lithe supple limbs crept down
the dim passageway to the door at
the far end

her tiny fist was clenched deter-
minedly around the cold butt of
her gun and she swore beneath her
breath that if she was too late her
first bullet would plow through the
yellow heart of the giant chang

  at the door she paused a moment
and listened her ear glued to the
panel faint noises sounded from
within and a foul strong odor
drifted out to assail her nostrils
her throat tightened and she swal-
lowed hard to keep from crying out
with a savage kick she flung the
door wide and charged into the
room before the chinaman was
aware of what was happening the
muzzle of her gun was boring into
his ribs

  a rapid sing-song of cantonese
poured from her lips with puzzled
astonishment written on his yellow

face chang raised his huge hands
above his head then still keeping
him covered margy backed to the
door and closed it

  now she ordered waving her
hand in monihans direction bring
him to

 chang hesitated a moment his
lustreless black eyes gazing stupidly
at her

  hurry she whispered or ill
blow your head off march

  chang knew better than to refuse
margy knew him well and she
also knew his type huge powerful
coolies almost insensible to pain
themselves and almost inhuman in
their ability to inflict torture on
others nevertheless they were used
to obeying orders

  almost mechanically he obeyed her
curt commands he went to the
locker and returned with a bottle of
whisky one swallow and monihan
stirred another shot and he came
to

  he sat up on the table dazed and
befuddled and looked vacantly about
him his dull eyes fastened on the
towering figure of chang but still he
did not understand was he dream-
ing was this some ghastly night-
mare

he closed his eyes tightly for a
moment to shut out the lights and
gradually the humming in his brain
subsided slowly it all came back
to him-klementoff-the signal-the
impact of something solid on his
skull probably changs handiwork
and now the chinaman was preparing
to finish him off

  monihan slid off the table landed
on shaky legs and weakly raised his
fists prepared to battle for it he
turned and it was then for the first
time that he saw margy and the
threatening weapon in her hand
still keeping her eyes on chang she


thrilling adventures

raised a slim hand and placed one
finger to her lips in a gesture for
silence

  with renewed vigor monihan hur-
ried over to her

  briefly she poured in his ears the
story of what she had done all we
can do now she finished is wait
for your friends to get here they
ought to make it any minute
monihan nodded reds got a
car and he can drive like a bat out
of hell hell be here if he got your
note

  if he didnt were finished said
margy grimly

monihans jaws set aggressive-
ly well fight our way out
dont be a fool she snapped
what good is this toy everybody
in this place has a gun use your
brains

  i guess that slant-eye knocked
them out of me replied monihan
sheepishly you do the thinking-
ill trail along

  ive got an idea said margy
after a moments thought she
turned on chang here chang
listen take all this stuff you re-
moved from his pockets bring it in
to klementoff as you always do and
tell him the task is finished under-
stand

  chang nodded

  you see pete explained margy
that will hold him off for a while
until those two get here with any
luck klementoff wont get curious
about me until its too late

  good stuff grunted monihan
go ahead

  and remember chang she went
on turning again to the chinaman
my gun will always be trained on
you through the hole in the door
one word-one false move-and you
go to meet your ancestors now-
move

chapter vii

the battle

while the chinaman was
gathering up the articles
he had taken from moni-
hans pockets a long dark touring
car was roaring its way up the wind-
ing road toward the peak once in
high corrigan kept his foot all the
way down to the floorboards on the
gas pedal by his side sat harden
silent immersed in his thoughts he
fondled on his knees a heavy shot-
gun occasional pedestrians blinded
by their headlights scurried from
their path like frightened rabbits

  corrigan hunched over the wheel
peering ahead for the side road that
led to the villa according to the di-
rections in margys scribbled note
he spoke from the corner of his
mouth

  if that blonde is trying to pull a
fast one-if shes leading us into a
trap    he did not finish the
sentence but the tone of his voice
boded no good for margy in the
event that their mission had been a
false one

  it looks funny all right ad-
mitted harden and if youre right
-well ill help you take care of her
she-theres your road red

  their approach to the gloomy
house in the palm grove was a very
different matter from monihans
cautious entry if margys note had
told the truth there was no time to
waste in reconnoitering the grounds
they had to act and act fast

  the big touring car roared up the
driveway grated to a sliding halt be-
fore the darkened villa almost be-
fore the wheels stopped spinning on
the gravel the two men guns in
hand were charging down the steps
to the doorway

  side by side their shoulders
smashed the portal and the pair stag-
gered into the narrow passageway
manchuria treasure



beyond from somewhere yellow-
faced men appeared in the shadows
of the hall shrill voices rang out
in alarm then a long knife its keen
blade glinting dully in the dim light
sang past corrigans ears and stuck
quivering in the wall beside his head

 almost on the instant his re-
volver flashed up belching vivid
orange flame devastation and all
hell popped loose guns cracked
out stabbing the darkness with
streaks of light sizzling ead and
shining steel threw up slithering
splinters of wood about their ears

  with his shotgun harden pumped
a blinding barrage up the passage-
way then flat on their stomachs
the pair slowly wormed their way up
the dark hall as a singing hail of
death whistled over their heads

there was no stopping the now
thoroughly aroused pair if pete
was there they would get him out
if he was dead-if they were too late
-their flaming guns would see to it
that he was not lonesome on his long
journey

  chang had been in the midst of his
little act for klementoff when the
attack came as the first terrific roar
echoed in the hallway the huge
chinaman spun around and pitched
headlong to the floor a bullet in his
brain

  margy without hesitating to seize
the opportunity for putting the yel-
low fiend out of the way forever
had emptied her automatic at him
through the peephole in the door

  klementoff leaped from his chair
and looked down at his fallen hench-
man in amazement then suddenly
he went livid with fury he knew
where that shot had come from
knew that the girl had turned traitor
to his camp well time for her
later

  instead he flashed for his own
gun urging on his men with gut-

tural oaths he fought with all the
desperation of a cornered animal
the room was filled with deafening
thunder and the smoke from many
guns swayed over the heads of the
struggling men like a shroud

  corrigan edging slowly down the
hall found the fusebox and plunged
the house into abrupt blackness
only the licking tongues of flame
from the guns showed how the
battle waged

  with bitter defeat in his heart
klementoff saw how his plan had
miscarried it was the girl who was
responsible the intense hate in his
heart distorted his face with claw-
ing fingers he edged himself across
the room to the secret door he was
half way across when harden poked
the muzzle of the shotgun around the
jamb of the door and fired a deadly
charge inside

  his consuming hatred of the girl
urged the russian on to his ven-
geance but his reason told him that
he could never make it reluctantly
he raised his voice and barked out a
few terse commands a yellow hand
found a secret panel in the side wall
of the room and klementoff charged
for the opening his followers
wormed their way across the room
and they fled blindly in his wake

  for another instant harden and
corrigan sprayed the place with fly-
ing lead then all was quiet

once more back in monihans
room at the metropole the four
went into executive session swiftly
monihan explained the story he
told the others of margys visit of
the fact that she was sayers daugh-
ter and their subsequent adventures

  shes got the tattoo and all he
finished from now on shes one of
us

  that introduction was enough for
corrigan and harden they forgot
their suspicions regarding the note


thrilling adventures

she had sent them and got down to
business

changed said margy klementoff
knows that our destination is macao

mand fast boats no matter what
we do he will be there ahead of us

rating is out then wed better stick
together tomorrow ill charter a
boat and have it waiting for us at
macao then well all take the mail-
boat over

  swell approved corrigan well

chapter viii

to macao

the next evening harden
margy and monihan dined
together in the latters room
they were taking no chances of a
last minute accident separating them

  i got the boat chartered all
right announced monihan exhibit-
ing a sheaf of papers the dolphin
-a british schooner shell be wait-
ing for us at macao

  ten oclock found them still wait-
ing but corrigan failed to appear on
the scene twenty minutes went by
-a half hour but he was still miss-
ing

 wed better get going said
monihan something must have
turned up but hell probably get
down to the steamer looks like
well have to take a taxi

  with their hands thrust deep into
their coat pockets and the girl be-
tween them they descended to the
lobby and crossed the veranda
just as they emerged from the hotel
a taxi pulled up before the entrance

  what a break grinned harden
thats the best-looking cab ive ever

seen in this town most of them are
such rattle-traps they shake you into
little pieces before you get where
youre going

  monihan called out to the driver
and as they crossed the sidewalk the
rear door of the cab swung open
swiftly they piled inside hesitating
only to cast a hasty glance up and
down the street apparently the
coast was clear

 margy jumped in first with
monihan close behind her but as
harden placed his foot on the run-
ning board before he could slip in
beside them the cold muzzle of a gun
ground into the small of his back

  do not move a sibilant voice
hissed in his ear

no one stirred no one answered
you mr monihan and the lady
please to throw your guns on the
floor otherwise your friend here
will die

  reluctantly they obeyed and their
revolvers clattered to the floorboards
a small saffron hand reached out
and gathered them

  i thank you went on the voice
now you may go on with your
journey

  a deft push sent harden tumbling
into the cab then the door slammed
behind him and before either of the
trio had a chance to move the taxi
slipped into gear and raced down the
street

simultaneously harden and
monihan jumped to the doors on
either side and then looked at each
other in consternation there were no
handles they put their weight
against them but they did not budge
monihan felt the side with his finger
and found nothing but cold sheet
metal

  under the flare of a match they
examined both doors carefully and
saw that they fitted perfectly into
the chassis of the car and evidently
manchuria treasure



could be opened only from the out-
side by a secret mechanism operated
from the drivers seat

  they attacked the glass partition
that separated them from the un-
heeding driver only to find that it
was made of unbreakable glass that
resisted their strongest blows the
small windows also were made of
the same substance it was no use-
they were sealed in the interior of
the cab

 monihan swore roundly damn
japs the one who shoved you in
here tom was one of the gang that
attacked me down that alley i
recognized his voice

  and i was cheering because this
swell looking bus was waiting for
us groaned harden sap

margy pushed her hat back on
her curly head well theres
no use worrying about it well
just have to fight it out when we get
out of this contraption

 monihan squeezed her hand
good kid he muttered hoarsely
only im afraid were done for if
they hadnt taken our guns we might
have a chance

  with a harsh grinding of brakes
the taxi came to an abrupt halt
monihan pressed his nose to the
glass and peered out into the gloom
beyond he saw a deserted brick
dock and the glinting water beyond
it they had pulled up alongside a
boat house a few sampans and a
large painted junk its sails down
bobbled at their moorings

  the driver of the taxi sounded his
horn once and waited

  as monihan watched the house a
door opened piercing the blackness
with a shaft of brilliant light two
men were silhouetted in the glare for
a moment and then they started for
the sealed cab

  at a sharp order from one the door
snapped open and the three inside

looked with impotent fury down the
threatening muzzles of two guns

  you will come out said a voice
one at a time

  there was nothing to do but obey

  with the muzzle of a gun prodding
each of the two men from behind
the three captives were pushed
along a suspended gangway to the
boat house they entered grimly
hands in the air two small stiff-
haired japanese and a villainous
looking white man were seated about
a bottle-littered table with a deck of
cards strewn over the greasy cover-
ing

they leered at margy as she en-
tered but a low growl from one
of the guards closed their mouths
and they confined themselves to
crooked smiles

  with business-like precision the
hands of the prisoners were securely
tied behind them then with the
guns still prodding them they were
pushed from the room and still fur-
ther down a dark passageway

 a door opened and they were
shoved like unwilling cattle to the
slaughter through it a lock snapped
shut behind them and they were
alone

  harden backed up to monihan
theyre not killing us yet he
whispered maybe theyre waiting
for klementoff get to work on the
ropes-we have to get loose

  without a word monihan obeyed
the sharp hemp tore his nails but he
worked determinedly with his con-
stricted fingers knot by knot the
rope loosened and at last harden was
free a moment later and he had
released margy and monihan the
latter cupped a match in his hands
and looked at his watch it was
eleven-twenty

  silently they tried the door but it
did not budge under their combined
weight a quick survey around


thrilling adventures

showed that there was no other exit
from the room time passed-bitter
speeding minutes eleven-forty fifty

 monihan swore futilely as the
hands on his watch crept around to
twelve

  a step sounded in the passageway
outside with a warding gesture of
silence monihan tiptoed to the door
as a key turned in the lock for a
moment a black shadow loomed in
the doorway then with the impact
of a battering ram petes fist landed
on the japs chin

as he staggered forward margy
grasped the automatic in his
limp hand to prevent it from clatter-
ing to the floor while harden caught
the sodden figure and eased it to the
boards

 then in darkness they held a
whispered consultation

  as they marched us in margy
told them i saw a speedboat tied
up to the float probably used by
klementoff if we can make it we
might catch the eastern prince-the
mail steamer-on her way out of the
harbor

  good for you whispered moni-
han

  great echoed harden give me
the gun then well charge the
room and ill hold them back at the
door while you two get the boat
started

  monihan protested at harden tak-
ing all the risk but he would not
yield

  silently they advanced down the
passageway and with a mighty heave
of his foot harden kicked open the
door the bottles danced on the
table as the card players jumped up
at their entrance

  before they had a chance to re-
cover from the shock harden swept
them with a slow fan-like motion of
his gun without waiting for more
monihan and margy sped to the

outer door and into the night while
harden slowly backed his way after
them

  a bottle hurtled through the air
at his head and in the same instant
hardens gun flamed winging a
leaden messenger of death at the
thrower the table overturned with
a rising crescendo as the booze
bottles crashed to the floor the
room was pitched into darkness a
darkness that was punctured by
savage spurts of jetting flame as
three revolvers spat venomous death
across the room

  silence for a brief moment har-
den trained his ears to catch
the sound of the motor something
moved inside the room the men
there had solved his disappearance
and were advancing on him he
crouched by the door his finger
cocked on the trigger of the auto-
matic

  then with a couch and a stutter the
engine picked up its loud thunder-
ous crescendo was music to hardens
ears then margy called to him he
had to risk a shot in the back as he
zigzagged down to the float but the
breaks were with him for once that
night

spitting death whistled over his
head around his head everywhere
but through his head a barrage of
bullets screamed through the night
as the three men charged out of the
room and emptied their guns at the
running figure

  harden flung himself bodily into
the cockpit as margy threw in the
clutch throwing a heavy lip of
water over the float the speedboat
careened out into the harbor with
wide open throtle

  margy crouched low over the con-
trols while monihan nursed the en-
gine the blue flame from the ex-
hausts trailed out behind like a
banner of hell again a wild volley
manchuria treasure



of shots rang out from the shore to
splinter off the hardwood deck of
the boat

  it took a skilled steady hand at
the wheel to guide the slithering
speedboat in and out of the clumsy
sampans and junks but margy never
batted an eye the awkward high-
prowed boats keeled hard over under
the three foot wave that surged back
from the knife-like prow of the
racing cutter

  at last the sweeping shore line
with its glittering lights that
stretched in a wide semi-circle and
mounted up to the heights of the
peak fell back off their stern margy
threaded the maze of winding chan-
nels with marvelous dexterity

  they were going at a dizzy pace
over the water and the little wind
ripples slapped against their bottom
with the solid impact of a hammer
nothing but the stern of the speed-
boat sat in the water as the flaming
exhausts licked hungrily at the
waves

 then far out on canton bay
twinkled the port lights of a
steamer with a deft hand on the
wheel margy slightly altered the
course of the speeding boat some
minutes later the towering walls of
the mailboat rose sheer above them
she circled the ship twice then
slowed down and pulled up alongside
the steamer amidships

cupping his hands to his mouth
monihan bellowed up to the
bridge ahoy eastern prince
three passengers to come aboard

  his hail was answered by a voice
of bells deep within the bowels of
the ship slowly the eastern
prince lost headway a megaphoned
voice bellowed down to them

  putting over a ladder for you to
come aboard look sharp now

  twinkling lights appeared on the
deck and a row of curious faces

peered down over the rail a cluster
of lights was swung over the side
and a jacobs ladder snaked down
into the water monihan caught hold
of it

  up with you margy he said

  and without hesitation the girl
clasped the perilous ladder and went
up hand over hand harden fol-
lowed her then monihan killed his
engine grabbed the rungs and
pushed the speedboat away from the
ships side with his dangling foot

 the curious watchers on deck
watched them climb up as margy
stepped on to the deck a swarthy-
faced young man with snarling lips
slipped away from his place in the
crowd and concealed himself behind
a ventilator an expression of
frustrated hate distorted his face as
harden and then monihan landed
solidly on the deck after the girl

  once more the internal throb of
the engine beat out its monotonous
rhythm as the eastern prince re-
sumed its course for macao

chapter ix
for a price

when klementoff strode
into the lobby of the
avenida hotel in macao a
message awaited him at the desk
he waited until he had retired to his
room before opening the missive
then for the next half hour the
cossack was a raging madman

  he stamped up and down the con-
fined quarters of his room working
himself into a fury his strong
twitching fingers worked convul-
sively and his breath came in short
rasping gasps from his distended nos-
trils the pupils of his eyes dilated
with anger and small flecks of white
foam collected at the corners of his
beard

so they had escaped him once
more had they three times now


thrilling adventures

his plans had miscarried from now
on he personally would see to their
execution and they were now on
their way on the eastern prince
but whether they would land in
macao alive-well that was another
matter

  he marched down once more into
the lobby of the hotel and questioned
the clerk regarding the arrival of the
steamer from hongkong tomor-
row eh he had to do some quick
thinking perhaps a drink would
help to stimulate his already active
brain

klementoff wandered down
the praia grande for a few
blocks then turned off down a side
street and entered a dingy ill-
smelling grog-shop as he eased his
huge bulk into a chair between a
battered table and a still more bat-
tered piano he glimpsed a face that
he dimly remembered after a mo-
ments frowning concentration he
placed the man

  ferreira that was it difficult
names these portuguese if he re-
membered correctly ferreira was a
man one could easily do business
with for in the old days his price
for the commission of any crime
from arson to murder was measured
in quarts of potent liquor

  klementoff rose from his chair
crossed the rough plank floor and
dropped a heavy hand on ferreiras
shoulder no he had not changed
much thinner perhaps but the evil-
ness of his soul was still stamped
plainly on his face

  you will have a drink with me
my friend suggested the russian

  ferreira looked up at him blankly

  you remember me do you not
persisted klementoff

  the portuguese shook his head
a vague uncertain recognition
glowed in his dull brain but the

effort of concentration was too much
and he gave it up

  no he answered stupidly i
do not

  well i know you-very well in-
deed grinned klementoff he
scraped back a chair and sat down
beside the other i have work for
you

ferreira appeared indifferent
at the mention of work

 it means much money said
klementoff a great deal of money
if you are successful

  ferreiras head snapped up and his
eyes glittered money money
meant liquor

  it is not difficult persuaded the
russian a few minutes of work
and you are finished but you must
be sober you must be steady of
hand

 well tell me grunted fer-
reira

  klementoff waved a hairy hand be-
fore him not now my friend i
do not trust your tongue you talk
in your drink but it is worth    
he whispered a sum into the por-
tugueses ear and ferreira stiffened
in his chair

  so he leered there is but one
thing for which a man will pay that
much money and that is    

  klementoffs fist clamped fiercely
over his jaw the russian glanced
hastily at the other occupants of the
grog-shop

  be quiet fooll if you wish the
money do not drink tonight come
to my hotel tomorrow-the avenida
i shall pay you half the sum agreed
at that time

  the rest when your work is fin-
ished you understand

 ferreira nodded his head and
pulled away from klementoffs hand
tomorrow he agreed
manchuria treasure



chapter x
the map is stolen

the trip on the eastern
prince was uneventful for
monihan margy and harden
they lolled under the awnings on
the deck and bridled their impatience
as well as possible and that was
no easy task as time dragged heavily
with inactivity black velvet night
engulfed the bay and the ship

  steadily the eastern prince held
her course throwing back a lazy lip
of foam from her prow as she cut
the swell from the china sea the
three leaned over the port rail amid-
ships and strained their eyes into the
black gloom toward the horizon

  well said harden at last we
anchor out at twelve tonight and no
getting ashore till morning im go-
ing to turn in

  me too said margy stretching
her arms and suppressing a yawn
the easiest way to kill the next
twelve hours is to sleep them off
what do you say pete

  they sauntered in the cool night
breeze to their adjoining staterooms
and with a casual good-night to one
another retired

	 

  klementoff was on the wharf when
the eastern prince eased up to her
anchorage outside the breakwater he
heard the far-away thunder of her
chain run through the hawse pipe as
the hook plunged into the still
water twinkling lights bobbed back
and forth on the steamer as the deck
crew opened the hatches

  a fleet of lighters an odd assort-
ment of craft loaded with provisions
put off from shore for the ship in
the darker shadow behind the rus-
sian slouched ferreira

  there is the boat said klemen-
toff turning to him do not for-
get what i have told you remember
stateroom fifty-six boat deck get

the chart and his papers i do not
care what you do-but get them and
bring them to me at once i shall
be waiting at the hotel

ferreira nodded his under-
standing and backed it up with
a vicious smile as he felt the razor-
sharp edge of a ten-inch blade of
steel

  i will get them pay first he
demanded

  half said klementoff passing
over a roll of bills you shall get
the rest when the papers are in my
possession

 how can i be sure whined
ferreira

  pig snarled klementoff you
do not take my word you must-
you have no alternative now-go

  ferreira lost himself on one of the
lighters and klementoff watched
with satisfaction as the lumbering
craft pulled out toward the break-
water then he turned and hurried
away

  ferreira with his knife tucked into
his belt had little difficulty in gain-
ing the deck of the eastern prince
he milled about for a minute with
the jabbering crew and when the
mate went forward to supervise the
opening of a hatch he slipped into
the gloom behind a ventilator

  his bare feet made no sound on
the wooden deck as dodging from
shadow to shadow he made his way
up the companionway to the boat
deck above it was quiet up there
the passengers slept

  he concealed himself behind a life-
boat for a few minutes and waited
but no one followed there was little
chance of his being disturbed for
what little noise he made was
drowned out by the noise in the
holds

  ferreira slipped out from his hid-
ing place and dodging from ventila-
tor to hatch snaked his way to the


thrilling adventures

starboard side of the ship cautious-
ly he peered down the long deserted
deck and silently made his way aft
to where a deck lamp glowed dimly
from above by its light he made
out the number on the nearest cabin
door it was seventy-four the one
he was seeking was further forward
amidships

  loosening his knife in his belt he
padded on crouched low against the
wall of the deck house he merged
himself in a patch of blackness
thrown by a skylight combing as the
sound of a door being slowly secret-
ly opened came to his ears

  his beady eyes accustomed to the
night followed the figure of the
man who emerged from a stateroom
a little ahead of him this new pawn
in the game looked cautiously up and
down the deck before proceeding on
tiptoe forward

  something blunt and dull gleamed
in his hand and in answer to it
ferreiras fingers tightened about the
hilt of his knife the new prowler
on the deserted deck crept forward
as silently as the portuguese had
come

amidships he stopped and
waited a moment then so softly
that the renegade behind him could
not hear the click of the key he un-
locked the door of a stateroom and
stepped in closing it once more be-
hind him without a sound

  ferreira crept forward rapidly a
flare of light burst like a bomb into
the night from the porthole of the
cabin that had just been entered
with a start of surprise the por-
tuguese read the number on the door
-fifty-six someone was there be-
fore him

  he raised himself and with one eye
looked through a corner of the port-
hole on a sight that held him spell-
bound his fingers clenched more
tightly around the haft of his knife

as he glued his eye to the glass and
watched

 the man he had followed down
the deck was standing over the
berth in his hand he held a leveled
revolver covering the heart of the
man he had prodded to wakefulness
with his gun his victims face was
a study of surprise and hate but
there was no fear in his eyes

  the intruder evidently was speak-
ing for as ferreira watched a cloud
of anger spread over the victims
face to change to a snarl as the gun
prodded him savagely words passed
between them and ferreira strained
his ear but could not catch them

  as he crouched there by the port-
hole he saw the man in the bunk
sullenly raise his hands over his head
as the others hand reached under
his pillow

ferreira gasped as the muti-
lated chart of which klementoff
had told him was brought to light
then to his utter amazement the
man crawled from the bunk and with
the gun of the intruder pushing him
from behind made for the door just
in time ferreira slunk away from the
porthole

  from a ventilator he watched the
strange procession march down the
deck-the man in pajamas prodded
on by the one with the gun the
two proceeded aft and ferreira grip-
ping his knife brought up the rear

  the pair ahead worked their way
behind a lifeboat and with a smile of
comprehension ferreira at last real-
ized the intention of their promen-
ade he crept out to the decks edge
and from the other end of the life-
boat watched with fascination the
execution of the tragedy being en-
acted before his eyes

  the man in pajamas stood on the
edge of the deck no rail before him
his back was to the killer a hun-
dred feet beneath the still dark
manchuria treasure



waters lapped at the sheer sides cf
the steamer

  suddenly the butt of the gun was
raised on high to descend with
crushing force on the skull of the
defenseless man he tottered a mo-
ment over the abyss and then
plunged downward a distant splash
of water-and then silence the
killer turned his task completed

  still with a cautious step he edged
down the side of the lifeboat from
behind which ferreira had witnessed
the scene a gleaming streak of
steel in the night and ferreiras
knife plunged through his throat
again the hand was raised and the
gory blade flayed downward once
again the man lay still on the
deck in a pool of blood-dead

  with deft fingers ferreira ex-
tracted the papers from his pocket
and transferred them to his own
the dimmed blade of his knife
described a dull parabola in the night
as it sailed over the side

klementoff started nervously
at the discreet rap on his door
in two hurried strides he was across
the room he turned the key and
ferreira stepped in

  be seated ordered the russian
swiftly he closed the slatted shut-
ters of the door that led to the bal-
cony outside then he turned to
ferreira once more well

  the money

  klementoff passed over the bocd
money with a grunt here now
-the papers

  he snatched them eagerly from
ferreiras hand examined them has-
tily and was satisfied

  you killed him he asked

  the portuguese smiled evilly
the two of them just as you said
with the knife

  two men

  two

  good where is the knife

  over the side answered fer-
reira with the dead man

the first hot rays of the morning
sun climbed over the rail of the
balcony and pierced the chinks of
the wooden shutters on the windows
slowly the light crawled up the bed
until it pried under the closed lids
of the russian tossing in fitful sleep
at last he opened his eyes

  instantly he was wide awake he
felt for the little packet tied around
his waist and at its reassuring touch
sank back at ease on the pillow

  after many long years of waiting
he was at last the possessor of the
chart many men had paid with their
lives for the dragon headdress but
klementoff had been patient cun-
ning he had the means to reach the
treasure and he smiled to himself at
the thought

 the japanese government had
financed him had placed a villainous
crew of cutthroats at his disposal in
return for the headdress when he
succeeded in attaining it klemen-
toffs lip curled in scorn fools he
would outwit them as he had out-
witted the others the dragon head-
dress was his and his alone

  he climbed out of bed the pas-
sengers would scon be disembarking
from the eastern prince and he must
be at the wharf to greet his son that
young hot head he was his fathers
pride and yet his greatest worry he
would keep the boy out of the way
until the long search for the treasure
was really over then together they
would reap the benefits of the
hoarded jewels

  it was with a friendly and com-
placent eye that klementoff surveyed
the city of macao as he set out for
the pier its gaily colored houses of
pink and yellow and green snuggled
on the protecting hillside were truly
a bit cf old europe set down in the
heart of the orient


thrilling adventures

  he thought of the pleasures to be
had in macao the gambling houses
opium dens and almond-eyed girls
who had acquired for it the name of
the monte carlo of the east time
enough for all that later with the
treasure of the manchus in his
hands 

  idly he watched a tender put off
from the eastern prince as the boat
came through the breakwater and
headed for the wharf the sun
glinted from the brass buttons on
official uniforms as it drew nearer
klementoff stiffened slightly and his
eyebrows drew up in a shaggy line

 the tender made fast and four
policemen each at the corner of a
white sheet lifted out and tugged
up a sagging bundle panting they
deposited it on the float sudden
realization dawned in klementoffs
mind harden or monihan

  a morbid desire to find out which
one of his victims it was impelled
him over to the gesticulating crowd
that gathered rapidly about the po-
licemen no one took notice of him
as he edged over to the sheet one
corner of which the wind had oblig-
ingly blown back

  one glance and the blood surged
from klementoffs face leaving it a
ghastly white his heart constricted
painfully his senses reeled he
became deathly sick

  the morbid fascination drew his
eyes again he looked down at the
distorted face of his son

	 

 the next morning the bloated
corpse of ferreira bumped crazily
against the pilings of the dock

       chapter xi
       still trailing

the blow that had sent moni-
han plunging down into the
water was a savage one and
cut a deep wound in his head he

struck the water with terrific force
and his unconscious body sank fath-
oms deep before the cold water
washed away the darkness that had
descended on his brain instinctively
he held his breath slowly his un-
conscious body rose to the surface
blinded broken spent monihan
flayed out both arms helplessly as he
gulped in hungry mouthfuls of air

  slowly he nursed back sufficient
strength to reach the ladder that hung
from the ships side with feet that
dragged heavily behind him he climb-
ed up to the deck and staggered down
to hardens cabin there he collapsed
in a limp and dripping heap on the
floor

  an hour later under the stimulat-
ing effect of a strong shot of whisky
he told his tale to margy and harden

  theres only one thing to do he
concluded klementoff must think
im done for he mustnt see me come
off the ship

  that ought to be easy harden as-
sured him well smuggle you off
in the morning dont worry

a tip that almost bulged out the
eyes of the chinese steward did
the trick later in the locked seclu-
sion of their room in a cheap hotel
they went over every detail of their
now disorganized plan the killing
of klementoffs son worried them
they had lost the chart and if it was
not in the cossacks hands-who did
have it

  it was a bitter dose for both men
after an hours excited argument they
lapsed into a sullen silence hardens
fingers itched for the sinewy throat
of the russian monihan pounded the
floor while margy slumped dejectedly
in a chair

  suddenly monihan yanked out his
gun and swiftly overhauled it

 where you going now asked
harden

  after that chart growled moni-
manchuria treasure



han no use twiddling our thumbs
klementoffs staying at the avenida
im going up there and have a show-
down if hes got it-he wont have
it long

  there was no dissuading him its
our only chance insisted monihan
we have to get that chart somehow
im off-be back in a half hour

  but it was only fifteen minutes be-
fore he was back his face even longer
and more sour than when he had left

 what happened asked margy
eagerly

  hes burned the chart spat moni-
han i found nothing but the ashes
there

the others considered this serious
bit of information for a long while
in silence then finally margy spoke

  it could be worse she said slow-
ly at least we know that klemen-
toff had it thats something posi-
tive then inspiration moved her
the russian thinks you are dead
doesnt he monihan nodded weary
assent and hes got all your papers
for the ship hasnt he well what
hell do then is to take over the
schooner in your place thats
simple

  yes-too simple said harden bit-
terly

  not if you get aboard her youll
have to

  by jove margy youre right ex-
claimed monihan well get aboard
let klementoff lead us to the head-
dress and then for the fireworks

  that afternoon two shabby dilapi-
dated beachcombers hung listlessly
around the waterfront though they
seemed indifferent enough to the
varied activity about them their at-
tention was concentrated on a trim
three-masted schooner that lay a little
way off shore all signs aboard
pointed to an early sailing

  suddenly monihans hand gripped
hardens arm an ancient hack ran

out on to the quay and klementoff
stepped out he called to a boatman
jumped into the stern of his skiff and
was rowed out to the schooner

  monihan and harden kept well out
of sight until klementoff returned
after he had disappeared up the
street again they waited another
hour then rowed out to the schooner
themselves on deck they found the
mate forward overhauling the anchor
gear

  need a couple of men mr mate
asked harden

  no replied the officer in a hur-
ried voice all hands signed on
any chances of working a pass-
age insisted monihan

  sorry boys replied the mate
just going a ways up the coast
thanks mister said harden
how about getting a hand-out in the
galley

  well i guess so replied the mate
but dont hang around i want to see
you over the side in fifteen minutes
right-o mister

they started down the deck to-
wards the galley amidships

  see if we can get some informa-
tion out of one of the crew ex-
plained harden couldnt question
the mate too much

  the cook was an agreeable soul and
dished them out a savory stew and
coffee after a few minutes they had
him talking

  the toff who chartered this bot-
tom was aboard about an hour ago
rum one he was name of monihan
but he looks more like a roosian than
a yank to me raising bloody hell
wants to sail in an hour but cant
be done till tonight in a gawd awful
hurry comes aboard shows his pa-
pers bawls out the mate and stamps
ashore again

 where you -bound for asked
monihan

  bit of a mystery signed on the


thrilling adventures

paper coastwise pleasure but
thats a rum one what pleasure in
sailing on this coast

  harden agreed with him and so
youre heaving anchor tonight eh
aye mate about twelve cant
get away before the roosians com-
ing aboard then with a party of
friends

  well well be going now many
thanks cook thats good slum youre
chucking out said harden and with
a friendly wave of their hands the
two would-be deck hands made their
departure

  they were silent while they rowed
back to the quay ashore harden
purchased two sea bags while moni-
han looked on a little puzzled they
did not speak until the door of their
room was locked behind them

well demanded margy eagerly
at their entrance

 you were right marge threw
back harden hes taken over the
ship

  and hes going to pull out without
us added monihan bitterly do you
think the cook meant klementoffs
pack of japs is coming aboard
most likely answered harden
were licked then said monihan
dejectedly red wont be here until
tomorrow

  no were not replied harden i
have an idea listen i know sailors
tonight after they knock off work
some of them will come ashore for
drinks well just waylay two of
them put em out of the way nice
and quiet and then go aboard in their
places

  great exclaimed margy tom
youre a wizard

  sure grinned monihan think
it will work

  you have a pair of fist havent
you she asked with a smile well
thats all there is to it

  it was their only chance and they

decided to act upon it they packed
their few belongings in their canvas
bags and waited for darkness

  quick quick called margy from
the window look

  they ran to her side and followed
the direction of her finger a ram-
shackle bus had just pulled up be-
fore the avenida hotel and as they
watched all that remained of the rus-
sians crew slid out and disappeared
into the hotel

  his yellow men are here all right
said monihan but the cook said that
they wouldnt sail till about mid-
night klementoff wont go aboard
till then time for us to get going
right agreed harden

  and you margy said monihan
turning to the girl if we get away
with it tonight you get red as soon
as he shows up and follow us if
you catch up with us - well well
leave the rest to your own judgment
but please now dont - dont take
too many chances

 margy returned his smile and
gripped his hand dont worry
leave that to me red and i will find
you

chapter xii
aboard ship

the two men left immedi-
ately after and by the time
they reached the circular
quay black night had fallen from
the dock they saw a few moving
twinkling lights on the schooner
they concealed themselves behind a
row of crates and waited

  an hour passed and nothing hap-
pened aboard the schooner the
hatches were battened down the last
wedge hammered home and silence
bettled over the ship

  if im right whispered harden
a boat ought to shove off any min-
ute now
manchuria treasure



   they strained their eyes across the
 murky waters and their ears were
 attuned to the faintest sound then
 from far out in the still night the
 dull thumping of oars in rowlocks
  came to them

  as they watched a small skiff
 pulled around the stern of the
 schooner and headed with lusty
 strokes for the landing stage

  as it cut cleanly through the
 water monihan and harden made
 out two men in it one dark
 silhouette that bent over the oars
 and the other on the tailboard as
 the skiff glided against the landing
 stage the rower shipped oars and the
 sailors climbed out making the boat
 fast monihan set himself for action

  well get them on their way
 back whispered harden with a re-
 straining hand on his companions
 shoulder

  they eased themselves further
 back into the shadows as the two
 men passed within a few feet of
 them their voices dwindled away
 into nothing as they disappeared into
 the gloom further up the quay

   ill take the first and you take
 the second whispered harden one
 punch has to do it well roll them
 in behind here and tie and gag them
 then well wait till theyre overdue
 before rowing out if im not mis-
 taken mister mate will be glad to
 get us

 an hour later muffled footsteps
 sounded down the dockway the
 two crouching figures unlimbered for
 action silently they crept around
 the jutting edge of the crate as
 the footsteps became more distinct
 their muscles tensed foi the spring

   another ten seconds and the sail-
 ors would be abreast of them

   monihans pulse pounded to each
 succeeding footstep and harden kept
 his hand firmly on his shoulder

  two black towering figures

sheered up ahead of them and the
hand was off monihans shoulder
like twin panthers the two men
leaped the powerful haunch mus-
cles of their legs hurtled them
through the air

  before he knew what had hit him
the first sailor crumpled to the
planking under monihans crushing
right to the chin while harden
caught his man just behind the ear
with a clubbing left that snapped
the sailors head halfway round be-
fore he fell no word had been
spoken not a noise had been made

picking up the two prostrate
men in their arms they carried
them behind the crates

  hated to do it buddy breathed
harden sympathetically to his un-
conscious victim but i did it fast
and quick you never knew what
hit you all youll have when you
wake up is a rotten headache

  and a stiff jaw grunted moni-
han

  in a few moments they had bound
and gagged the two sailors and then
monihan slipped into their pockets
some bills more than sufficient to
compensate them for the unwar-
ranted blows and the loss of their
gear aboard the schooner

  they waited out another half hour
in silence then picking up their
bags they crept down to the skiff
monihan cast loose and harden
picking up the oars pulled for the
schooner

  ahoy there dolphin ahoy
monihan bellowed up to the dark
deck

  a light scurried along the rail
its glare revealed the face of the
mate staring down at them

  whats up there below he
called down at them

  just heard ashore that two men
jumped ship lied harden thought
maybe youd sign us on


thrilling adventures

  so they jumped ship did they
echoed the mate come aboard

sharp r

with elation in their hearts they
pulled alongside the mate
threw them a line and they sent
their bags aboard and a moment later
climbed up the rope after them

  the mate was waiting for them as
they landed on the deck he looked
them over his first thought being
that they were two likely looking
sailormen and then recognition
dawned in his eye

  werent you two aboard here this
afternoon he asked suspiciously

  yes mister answered harden
we were looking to ship out

  well i see you succeeded you
say those two men jumped ship eh
you sure got wind of it in a big
hurry mighty queer he growled
eyeing them narrowly

  monihan hoped he would not press
the question further it did not bear
investigation he vaguely wondered
what would happen if the schooner
did not sail that night and the two
gagged sailors were discovered in
the morning too late now for re-
grets they were aboard the dolphin
and they had to stay there

 we were hanging around the
quay when we heard them speaking
about it and knowing you were sail-
ing tonight we came aboard at
once offered monihan in explana-
tion

  well grumbled the mate still
unconvinced get forward i guess
one of you beachcombers is as good
as another he turned on his heel
still muttering dont like it too
damned much mystery aboard this
shipl

  without waiting for more moni-
han and harden slipped forward to
the focsle five men were asleep
in the bunks harden looked them

over hurriedly then gave a little
sharp gasp of surprise

  whats up whispered monihan

  a break-a real break two old
friends of mine-two old sailormen
gimp and tar i once did em both
a big favor and theyll never forget
it

  you mean youre going to tell
them   began monihan doubt-
fully

  yes why not well need all
the allies we can get and i know
these two theyre white pete i
can trust them

  he stepped over to the nearest
bunk and gently shook the sleeping
occupant

  hey gimp wake up he whis-
pered softly you tar snap out
of it

the two sailors came to at once
there was a startled moment of
recognition then cordial greetings
all around when the enthusiastic
introductions had been completed
harden mysteriously led the men out
to the focsle head for a whispered
consultation

  swiftly he told the two grizzled
sailors the story of their adventure
gimp and tar listened with rapt at-
tention nodding with silent assent
at each new fact

  and if hell breaks loose we want
you two to side in with us finished
monihan

  are you game asked harden

  game grinned gimp itll be
a joy

  were not forgetting what you
did for us added tar

  then its settled breathed har
den with elation we got a chance
now	

  klementoff has the ship now
whispered monihan hes coming
aboard with his pack of japs tonight
and theyre sailing we dont know
what happened to red corrigan but
manchuria treasure



miss sayers is waiting in case he
turns up with orders to follow us

  that part is all right replied
gimp but therell be bloody ell to
pay if this here roosian discovers
you

  we know replied harden but
thats the chance we have to take
everybody hang together as much as
possible and keep off the deck as
much as we can if something breaks
well all stick together and give em
a run for their money all we ask
is that klementoff takes us to the
island and then well make a little
hell of our own

for another half hour they con-
sulted together and so engrossed
were they in their convex sation that
they did not notice the rising wind
which forecast a stormy passage
with each succeeding minute it
grew in violence and a black mass
of clouds scurried low across the
sky

 suddenly breaking in on their
lowered voices came the sound of
high querulous voices from over the
storm-tossed water the four con-
spirators lay flat on the deck and
looked and listened

 soon they heard the sound of
muffled oars and then they saw a dim
light out on the water from the
floorboards of a large skiff loaded to
the gunwales in the stern perched
precariously on an assortment of
luggage klementoffs pack tossed
and swayed to the rocking of the
boat while the russian himself bal-
anced himself in the bow

 their guttural profanity was
picked up by the wind and carried
screaming away into the night in
a sudden burst a squall of rain
drenched the ship and the beating
wind flicked the surface of the
water to a frothy white it seemed
that with one accord the elements
had decided to lend themselves to

the mood and humor of the dark ex-
pedition about to set forth

  thats our second break whis-
pered harden to the watching men
theyre all a little drunk and the
chances are the russian has enough
rum aboard to keep them that way
for a long time

  and if this heavy weather keeps
up itll go a long way to make that
bunch of yellow japs a sick gang
of men grunted gimp

 the skiff scraped along the
schooners side and the boatman
made fast then jabbering inco-
herently in high - pitched voices
klementoffs men piled aboard

 these are the men im taking
with me said the russian to the
mate as the latter surveyed the mot-
ley crew with a jaundiced eye
quarter them amidships

  aye sir replied the mate still
eyeing the japs with ill-concealed
dislike orders sir

  yes up anchor

  very well sir

  the mate turned to get his ship
under way and klementoff disap-
peared with his henchmen into the
cabin amidships

chapter xiii
the island of treasure

the early promise of the wind
was fulfilled in a half gale as
the dolphin heaved up anchor
and with a patch of square sail on
bare poles beat her way out of the
tiny harbor and headed for open sea

  once clear of the protection of the
land the schooner heeled hard over
to the storm and scudded along with
a hissing lip of foam under her fig-
ure head the heavier the weather
the better it pleased monihan who
flung his defiance to the elements
with a silent shout as he straddled
his feet at the wheel


thrilling adventures

  for two days the storm buffeted
the ship like an egg shell but gallant-
ly she beat her way north klementoff
and his crew were content to remain
in the comfortable dry cabin amid-
ships and only on rare occasions did
any of them show on deck

monihan and harden got away
with their imposture without
much difficulty

 dawn of the third day found
monihan standing his trick at the
wheel and as the first long rays of
the rising sun lit up the water he
saw that they were sailing parallel
to a long sandy island that con-
tinued as far as the eye could see
into the north

  he scanned the shore line eagerly
comparing it mentally with the ill-
fated chart he felt sure that they
were fast approaching their destiny
and destination

  toward afternoon the wind died
down somewhat and the storm
abated klementoff came out on deck
and examined the island for a long
time through a pair of binoculars
he seemed pleased with what he saw
for a bland smile showed through his
beard

  late that afternoon as harden
came off watch gimp managed to
whisper some very important news
to him

 were anchoring out tonight
about six bells he said in the
morning the roosian is going ashore
thinks this is the place heard him
talking to the mate

  and i guess hes right replied
harden now is the time we got
to be careful soon as we anchor
meet us up on the focsle head pass
the word along to tar

  at about half past eleven that
night the anchor chain of the
dolphin rumbled through the hawse
pipe and the hook plunged into ten
fathom of cold gray water as soon

as the sails had been taken in the
four conspirators one by one made
their way to the focsle head

  i got a hunch boys began moni-
han that tomorrow things will hap-
pen keep close together well
have to see klementoffs first move
before we do anything

  do you think hell take us ashore
with him asked harden

  no i dont chances are hell go
with his men if he does well and
good well know if he has the
treasure when he comes back and
then the thing is simple

  i dont think hell get the treas-
ure volunteered harden remem-
ber what your father said in the let-
ter about you and margy having to
work together

  yes i remember replied moni-
han thoughtfully cant figure that
out

  the mate routed them out at dawn
the next morning and after a hur-
ried breakfast put them to work un-
covering the two small boats even
at this early hour there were signs
of activity amidships where klem-
entoff and his men were quartered

the boats uncovered the mate
came up and supervised the stow-
ing of provisions water lamps and
all equipment necessary for a few
days stay ashore

  slowly the sun rose in a stainless
heaven and with it excited voices
from the cabin at last klementoff
showed himself followed by his men
he strutted as proud as a peacock
to the rail and again scanned the
shore through his binoculars some
object ashore held his particular at-
tention

  monihan strained his eyes toward
the spot and made out vaguely some
way up the beach the dim outlines
of a tumbled pile of brick half cov-
ered with sand
manchuria treasure



  for a moment his heart skipped
a beat for he was sure that that
particular bit of ruin had been plain-
ly marked on the chart not only
that it had been the central the
prime key to the entire map yes
klementoff had taken him to the ex-
act place all right and the problem
now resolved itself down to a battle
of wits

  after a close inspection of the
ruins the russian directed his men
back to the cabin they reappeared
a moment later staggering beneath an
assorted load of firearms they piled
them in a heap besides the boats and
then returned for cases of shells

this strenuous work completed
the japs turned again to the
ships rail and leaning heavily on it
gazed longingly at the shore kle-
mentoff ignored them for a few
minutes and personally superin-
tended the loading of the guns and
ammunition

  he stood within a foot of moni-
han spoke to him ordered him but
he himself was so engrossed with
thoughts of the fortune ashore that
he altogether ignored that gruff
yes and no with which monihan
answered him

  of course three days growth of
stubble on his chin had changed
monihan somewhat but if klementoff
had bothered to look squarely at him
once the game would have been up

  for a half hour monihan worked
on pins and needles expecting to be
discovered any minute but klemen-
toffs thoughts were far away the
big russian was day-dreaming of
various ways in which he would
spend the money which the dragon
headdress would mean to him

  at his direction monihan stowed
away everything down to the last
case with a heave he swung it up
from the deck and gently lowered
it into the lifeboat

  with a grunt of relief he relaxed
his straining muscles and lifted his
arms clear but fate at that moment
must have decided that she had been
far too kind toward his enterprise
for by an impish twist the sleeve of
mcnihans shirt caught on a project-
ing nail and as he pulled his arm
roughly away the entire sleeve
stayed behind

  the noise of the tearing cloth at-
tracted klementoffs attention in a
minute he looked down at moni-
hans bare forearm for a casual mo-
ment then he stiffened his eyes
bulged his breath whistled between
his teeth for there before his eyes
boldly engraved on monihans mas-
sive forearm was the twin tattoo it
was curiously like the one the cos-
sack had studied for a long time on
margys arm

  the russians first startled sur-
prise was his undoing he was just
a fraction of a second too late on
the draw for the gun at his hip and
he found himself staring down the
business end of monihans revolver

 tom monihan barked to har-
den who was working on the other
lifeboat

harden turned and took in the
situation at a glance monihan
nodded toward klementoffs crew
still lined up at the rail their backs
to the interesting scene being en-
acted before the lifeboat

  one word out of you klementoff
whispered monihan and ill drill
you straight between the eyes im
reserving that happy occasion until

i	make sure that youve brought me
to the right place but kick up a
row now and youre dead i dont
care much if you do

klementoffs bearded face went
black with rage his great hairy
hands clenched and unclenched them-
selves and even if he had dared to
call for help it would have been


thrilling adventures

impossible for the terrible fury that
completely paralyzed his tongue
the best he could do was mouth an
inarticulate oath

  get those japs ordered moni-
han send gimp after the mate and
tar after the other sailors

with a grin on his face harden
rounded up the two men and
gave orders then with gun drawn
made his way silently to klementoffs
unsuspecting crew

  put em up he growled all of
you you yellow devils

  there was no mistaking the mean-
ing of his words backed up by the
motion of his gun they turned
about in stunned silence and sullenly
stretched their arms above their
heads when monihan saw that
harden had done his job he slowly
backed the raging russian across the
deck and lined him up with his men
a moment later gimp prodded forth
the protesting mate and lined him
up with the others

  this is an outrage piracy he
stormed youll rot in gaol for this
you fools

  thats enough out of you roared
harden at him one more word and
youll rot-on your own deck

  they waited a moment until tar
came up trotting behind the sailors
who without a protest took their
places in the line-up and reached for
the sky then monihan surveyed his
handiwork and a slow smile spread
over his face easier than we
thought eh boys he laughed
now harden give me your gun
ill hold this outfit off while you
lower the lifeboat well beat them
there yet

  harden slipped his gun into moni-
hans left hand and with tar and
gimp hard on his heels jumped
across the width of the deck they
heaved mightily on the tackle and
slowly swung the loaded boat clear

  of the davits and then sheered it over
the side

  boats over he shouted

  lower away then called back
monihan

  arent you coming

  sure lower the boat

 without another word harden
obeyed in a minute the boat bobbed
in the water by the side of the
schooner

  all set below he called

  cast off then and row ordered
monihan

  pete-arent you coming called
back harden anxiously

  sure but row for all your worth
row out of range ill make it
shouted monihan

  at a sign from harden his two
men shipped oars and pulled away
from the dolphin as the sound of
their oars became faint monihan
spoke to the line of muttering men

  a little surprise party for you
eh he taunted them i havent
fired at anyone yet but from now
on im not going to be so careful
you can tell your crew that for me
klementoff understand

as he spoke he began to back
slowly across the deck to the
opposite rail

 just stay where you are the
first one that moves is asking for
trouble and i never miss at such
close range

  klementoff knew him well enough
to take him at his word he growled
a few terse sentences at his crew and
they kept their hands rigidly in the
air in a minute monihan was across
the deck then still keeping his re-
volvers trained on the line of men
he did an agile bit of gymnastics and
sprang over the rail teetering at the
very edge of the ship

  once more monihan surveyed the
line of strap-hangers then he
laughed
manchuria treasure



  so long klementoff if youre
looking for more-come ashore
and with the invitation on his lips
he whirled and dove clean into the
water

  the sound of his splash was the
signal for the entire line to wheel
around as one man like a surging
wave they broke across the deck
klementoff leading the van his gun
glinting a shower of shots rang
out and the barrage of lead kicked
up tiny geysers of foam on the
water

for an instant monihans head ap-
peared above the surface some
fifty yards from the ship but before
any man could draw a bead on him
he had ducked again another burst
of shot from the schooner skipped
harmlessly off the surface where his
head had been a moment before

  monihan swam under water straight
for the small boat which harden
commanded he came up once again
for air but was gone too quickly for
the men on deck to be effective with
their guns harden rested on his
oars and in a few minutes monihan
swam alongside to be pulled in by
eager hands

  the four men pulled mightily and
sent the loaded boat skimming over
the water even as monihan had
predicted as they looked up after
each stroke they saw klementoff
raging up and down the deck fran-
tically urging his men as the other
skiff was put over the side

  like a crew of yellow pirates the
japanese tumbled in falling over
one another as they reached for the
oars soon they had the boat under
way and propelled by six pairs of
saffron arms it took up the chase
long before they were within range
of monihan and his crew they
opened fire but the fugitives still
sweated at their oars realizing the

folly of wasting a stroke to return
the fire

  slowly but steadily the pursuing
boat overtook them the leaden
slugs from the belching guns of
klementoffs crew spat closer and
closer in the water about them still
monihan did not return the fire his
entire energies were bent then on
reaching the beach which was now
only a little distance off

  without losing a stroke monihan
gave orders to his men

  when we beach her he said
you and i tom will hold off klem-
entoff while tar and gimp unload
the truck out of here and carry it
up to the ruins well barricade our-
selves there thats where the treas-
ure is weve got enough ammuni-
tion to hold off all hell until margy
and corrigan get here

  thats our best bet i hope noth-
ings happened to red answered
harden if they dont get here-
were sunk pull men pull

  another few strokes and the keel
of the boat ran up on the sand as
soon as they touched bottom the men
were over the side and the loaded
skiff was drawn up on the shore
monihan and harden threw them-
selves behind the side of the boat
and unlimbered their guns while the
other two loaded themselves with
supplies and made for the ruins

as klementoff rowed within range
harden opened up he didnt
fire blindly he steadied his gun on
the gunwale of the stranded skiff
took careful aim and then let them
have it a scream of pain from one
of the japs and a chorus of yelps
from the rest told the defenders on
the beach that the lead had found a
mark

  the crew in the boat backed water
and concealed themselves as well as
possible on the floor boards of their
skiff from here they returned the


thrilling adventures

fire a rain of bullets zipped over
monihans head another burst threw
up splinters as it ploughed into the
side of their improvised breastwork

  its going to be hot work for the
boys monihan told harden well
have to pump fast and straight when
they come back for another load and
keep those yellow devils out there
under cover

  they held their fire for a moment
they gave klementoff all the chance
he wanted to throw lead at them but
a moment later when tar and gimp
returned for another load they
opened up with a devastating wither-
ing fire that swept the gunwale of
the boat that was creeping up upon
them no head showed itself guns
were thrust over the side and fired
blindly at the shore but tar and
gimp made the trip in comparative
safety

chapter xiv
the siege

for  n hour the battle raged
first one side firing and then
the other slowly but surely
the wind from the china sea edged
klementoff closer to shore but by
this time monihans boat was almost
unloaded he decided to withdraw
to the ruins after one more trip but
that trip was never made

  sweating under their herculean
labors and sorry that they werent
getting a chance at the gunplay
gimp and tar trotted across the
beach for the last trip they were
halfway to the boat when their ad-
vance was suddenly checked by a
terrific barrage of lead from the
skiff with the first burst tar spun
around and crumpled up on the sand
and instinctively gimp flattened him-
self beside him

  with an agonized heart monihan
saw his new-found comrades fall

 gimp he shouted did they
get you too

 no-only tar

  drag him out of range then
shouted monihan take him up to
the ruins well hold them off here

as gimp started to wiggle his way
across the sand dragging the
body of his wounded pal behind him
klementoff opened fire again but
this time the burst did not go un-
answered both harden and moni-
han swept the skiff with their smok-
ing guns

  the firing switched abruptly to
their refuge a splintering hail
crashed into the side of the boat be-
hind which they were sheltered
gimp continued his slow progress
across the sand and while harden
and monihan fired as fast as their
fingers could clench on their hot
guns he managed to drag tar out of
range

  well have to run for it tom
said monihan as he reloaded an-
other five minutes and therell be
nothing left of this hulk but splin-
ters

 a gun spat flame from klem-
entoffs boat at the same instant
monihan and harden went into ac-
tion with a furious burst of lead
over the side of their demolished
skiff each emptied his gun in one
short burst and even before the echo
died away they were racing across
the sand

  they had gained fifty yards before
the raging klementoff kicked his
crew into action again it was the
russians fury that defeated him in
the end he had so instilled the fear
of wrath into his yellow followers
that instead of mowing down moni-
han and harden like ninepins as they
ran they succeeded only in clipping
harden in the shoulder

 by the time klementoff had
beached his boat monihan and his
manchuria treasure



companions were firmly entrenched
behind the crumbling walls of the
ruins a quick survey of the place
told them that it had once been a
lighthouse but for years it had not
been used nothing remained of it
but a crumbling moldy wail about
waist-high but it served as an ad-
mirable breastwork

  with monihan and harden at the
walls coolly sniping at klementoffs
crew as they advanced gimp busied
himself with tar who had received
two bullets through his shoulder
while the unconscious man was still
out gimp sterilized the blade of his
knife in a match flame and then with
his knees firmly pressing down on
tars back he gently probed with
the steel for the bullets

tar groaned feebly but gimp
worked on and at last fished out
the flattened lead then he tightly
bound the wounded shoulder and
carried tar to a far corner

  klementoff steadily advanced with
his men till the bullets from the
guns behind the wall threw up spurts
of sand into his face then the siege
began

  that was just the beginning for
two days the siege lasted the sandy
flea-bitten island took on the aspect
of the world war front neither
side gained an advantage

  klementoff and his yellow follow-
ers were still as far away from the
ruins as he had been the first day
while the defenders inside were still
unsuccessful in their sporadic search
for the treasure

  as evening fell on the second day
and the sun sank glowing into the
waters of the china sea the firing
from klementoffs camp grew less
rapid it was disheartening to fire
forever at a blank wall unless some-
one was lined up against it

  more than one japanese had been

sent screaming back with a slug in
his body in a vain endeavor to edge
up closer to the ruins they knew
better now and despite klementoffs
exhortations they kept safely out of
range

inside monihan and tar held the
wall gimp was off in a corner
snatching a few winks of much-need-
ed sleep despite the crackling of the
guns and the bitter smoke whirling
around the place harden for the
hundredth time was prying into the
heap of rubbish that littered the floor
at last despondent and weary he
slumped down beside monihan and
picked up a revolver

  no luck pete he began ive
gone over the damn room backward
and forward and back again but no
sign of the treasure are you sure
this is the right place

  positive answered monihan my
father was right we wont find the
headdress until margy gets here
what the devils happened to
red growled harden irritably if
he doesnt show up soon it looks bad
for us everything is running low
water food and worst of all lead
if he doesnt come soon were going
to be a pretty sorry crew i know how
klementoff finishes off his little play-
mates

  ive got an idea answered moni-
han i think its quite likely that
margy and red are out cruising
around some place looking for us
im going to bring them here
how grunted harden

 watch me said monihan he
went over to gimp sorry gimp
but see if you can knock off a few
japs for a while im going to slip
off to the beach keep klementoffs
crew busy while i make the break
out in the darkness he slowly
wiggled his way toward the shore
he smiled to himself as he heard the


thrilling adventures

defenders open up with a heavy bar-
rage

  it took him more time than he had
figured to crawl through the tangled
brush that covered the ground back
of the beach the moon lost itself
behind a bank of clouds and under
cover of the darkness he rose from
his hands and knees and sped silently
toward the waters edge

  he threw himself in and swam un-
der water until his lungs threatened
to burst from the strain then he
rose to the surface and struck out
with long easy strokes for the
dolphin

  when he reached her slack anchor
chain he rested a moment and then
climbed silently up it hand over hand
on deck he crouched for a moment
listening

  but the only sound that came to
his ears was the steady rattle of
gunfire from the shore

  like a shadow he crept to the lamp
room under the focsle head softly
he closed the door behind him then
he went to work and gently tilted
over three cases of oil until the tiny
compartment was drenched

  next he laid a trail of oil-soaked
waste out to the deck a touch of a
match and with an eager hiss the
flame sputtered along the fuse to the
lamp room waiting for no more as
silently as he had come monihan
slipped over the side and struck out
for shore

he had just crossed the beach and
was safe again in the rank under-
growth beyond when with a roar the
entire fore part of the schooner went
up in a blaze the licking oil-fed
flames billowed sky-high and the
heavens took on a red and sinister
glow

  even as he watched the light
breeze scattered the flames to the rig-
ging and in a trice the dolphin was a
beething roaring cauldron of fire

chapter xv
the manchu headdress

huddled in their cruiser
their stolid faces beginning
to take on a look of black
suspicion the dozen chinese mut-
tered sing-song monosyllables ter each
other margy at the prow looked
back over her shoulder and turned to
corrigan

  it looks bad she whispered
weve go to do something theres
going to be trouble

 once more corrigan swept the
horizon with gloomy eyes then
suddenly his hand shot out and
gripped her arm look look he
shouted pointing his finger over the
water

  margy followed the direction of
his hand and saw a tiny spark of
flame on the horizon as the two
watched in fascination it grew in
volume then of a sudden it leaped
up in wild fury and the distant
heavens took on a ghastly reddish
glow a shout went up from the
chinamen

  margy rushed to the wheel grabbed
it from the wheelsmans hands and
put it hard over until the cruiser
was bearing directly on the blaze in
the sky in an instant all the apathy
of the yellow crew was sloughed off
excited voices shouted orders and
shining rifles and revolvers were
caressed lovingly by saffron fingers

 the blaze from the burning
schooner sent a swirling cloud of
black smoke down upon them as they
drew near as they charged through
the effective screen they heard for
the first time the distant rattle of
guns on the shore margy hailed
corrigan

  theyre still fighting it out
were in time im going to drive
this bus right up on to the beach

  good for you cheered corrigan
were ready for it
manchuria treasure



  the sun had just peeped over the
horizon when they ran out of the
smoke screen directly ahead of
them two hundred yards away was
the shore the crisp staccato firing
now came plainly across the water
and they saw the gray ghostly curl
of smoke trailing skyward from the
belching guns

then as if their arrival was a
signal the firing was suddenly re-
doubled and a mighty shout went up
from shore the cheers of the be-
sieged crew rang out above the
panic-stricken cries of the japanese

  head on screamed margy grip-
ping the spokes of the wheel with
clenched hands watch the crash-
then over the side

 with a rumbling thunder the
cruiser threw itself far up on the
sandy shore the force of the sud-
den impact knocked margy sprawling
on the deck but she scrambled to
her feet as the boat keeled over
with the rest of the men she flung
herself over the side into the water

  up the sand charged the chinese
all their pent-up emotions suddenly
released at the sight of their hated
enemies a blood-curling yell rose
from their lips with an impetuous
rush they bore down on the japs
guns blazed and barked

  corrigan staggered along in the
van with his spitting revolver sweep-
ing a path of death before him

  men staggered and cursed only to
come up again with a smoking gun
to spit forth a final volley of death
before going to the black beyond
the japanese fought with fury

  klementoffs voice rang out in
hoarse unheeded orders as monihan
and his crew charged out of their
improvised fort and plowed down
into the thick of battle

  if hes alive-save him for me
was monihans cry

  he charged down the intervening
distance swaying in and out of the
smoke wreaths looking for the tall
figure of the russian klementoff
saw him coming and his gun flashed
up but before he could pull the trig-
ger monihan let him have it the
big cossack coughed as a bloody
froth gushed from his bearded lips
then he spun wildly around and
pitched headlong to the sand

  deprived of their leader the last
two japs threw down their guns the
triumphant chinese surrounded them
and led them off down the beach

  margy with tears streaming down
her face stumbled across the sham-
bles into monihans waiting arms

  once more inside the ruins margy
bathed an ugly bullet wound that
had seared its way across monihans
forehead meekly he submitted to
her ministrations with a wrench
she pulled the sleeve from her dress
and made a bandage of it

  as she lifted his head her bare
arm pressed against monihans for a
minute

harden who had been smilingly
watching the proceeding stifled
a cry and grasped the two arms he
held them together look

  what are you talking about
asked margy

  in his excitement harden ignored
her pete-look will you the
tattoos your fathers secret

  at his excited words the assem-
bled crowd gathered about them for
a moment margy forgot the urgency
of the bandage with amazed eyes
they looked down at their respective
arms and at the twin tattoos which
were matched together

  see margy exclaimed monihan
its all clear now those twin
tattoos together the way they are
now make a floor plan of this old
lighthouse my father must have en-
graved them on our arms when we


thrilling adventures

were kids look that line on your
arm comes down to a line here on
mine making an arrow and that
arrow is pointing right over to that
corner of the room im a liar if the
dragon headdress isnt found there

before he had finished speaking
corrigan and harden were dig-
ging up the stones where the arrow
had indicated monihan made a
movement to rise but margy gently
pushed him back again

  wait a minute she urged the
treasure wont do me any good if you
pass out on me

  monihan relaxed in her arms id
sooner have you than the jewels
anyway he smiled you know
margy that im not going to pass
out on you-ever

  a shout of triumph went up from
the crew as harden straightened up
from his labors he brought to light
a canvas covered bundle

  swiftly he unwrapped it and his
trembling fingers pulled away the
rotting canvas underneath was a
further wrapping a square of crim-
son velvet as eager hands removed
the silken cover a low gasp broke
from the lips of the watchers

  there in all its glory reposed the
dragon headdress of the manchus

  fashioned by skilled artisans long
dead an intricate fretwork of gold
and delicate-hued enamel the gor-
geous gems that studded the head-
dress winked back at them with
dazzling rays of gleaming light for
a moment all were speechless moni-
han was the first to find his voice

  whew he whistled no wonder
there was a mad scramble to get the
thing he looked up at margy

youll wear it-on your wedding
day

  im sorry but nobody will ever
set that thing on their neads again
said corrigan soiemnly

  all eyes turned to his

 corrigan waved a hand at his
yellow-skinned followers you are
looking at soldiers even if they
dont wear uniforms he explained
soldiers of the chinese republic
why do you think these men came
out here with me and fought like
yellow devils from hell

  it was in hongkong he went on
that i learned about the crew of
japs that klementoff was taking
with him i figured we couldnt
make it alone so i made a deal with
general-well never mind his name
-he exchanged a rapid glance with a
tall chinaman opposite him-and he
agreed to help us

  i sent a message to the hotel but
i guess it didnt reach you in time
we found you gone and i went on
to macao there i found margy and
you know the rest

and the deal you made asked
monihan in a thin voice

  the headdress must be destroyed

  monihan sank back into margys
arms and stared up blankly at his
friend it was unbelievable after
all they had gone through now that
they had found the treasure

  the tall chinaman stepped for-
ward

  i believe you do not understand
he explained the chinese govern-
ment seeks only to destroy the sym-
bol of manchu power the gems are
yours the headdress will be dis-
mantled melted down the gold and
jewels are yours to do with what you
wish that is all-the republic of
china owes you a great debt

  monihan sat up suddenly as two
of the soldiers stooped to pick up
the glittering headdress he pointed
a lean forefinger at a sparkling dia-
mond that graced the front of the
diadem then grinned up at margy
he turned to the soldiers be care-
ful of that stone he warned itll
make a swell solitaire
the crawling creature

every step meant danger in the trail of dan
bucklys mysterious sinister killer

by donald bayne hobart

a ullior of v oodoo vengeance 

 ayres swung around tensely

        the heavy rifle that he held
x x in his hands was ready as he
gazed back his eyes searched the
dense undergrowth that lined the
faint trail through the jungle

  the low overhanging branches of
the trees made it dark and shadowy
despite the hot sun overhead it was
hard to see clearly for any distance
twenty feet away sections of the
brush were merely black splotches
just beyond the reach of the sun-
light

the whispering menace etc

  for the past hour he had been al-
most certain that he was being fol-
lowed he had expected that he
would be ever since he had come
back to the camp that he and dan
buckly had made during the previous
night

 finding dan that way had been
horrible dix ayres did not like to
think about it yet it was hard to
forget his friend lying there just at
the edge of the little clearing his
head smashed like an egg shell and
those two ghastly red xs drawn


thrilling adventures

across his cheeks with his own blood

  ayres was sure that it had not been
done by the natives they were not
very friendly toward what few white
men ventured into this part of the
african brush but still they were
comparatively peaceful no it had
not been the natives ayres was sure
of that it was something far more
sinister

  something which even the blacks
themselves feared and that was the
crawling creature

 the crawling creature-no one
knew just what it really was for
those few who had seen it had died
just as had dan buckly murdered by
that one powerful blow that cracked
open their heads it might be hu-
man and then again it might be some
unusual species of huge ape

  the natives those few that ayres
had found willing to talk about it at
all seemed to believe that it was
some sort of strange beast that had
spread a wave of terror over the
jungle ayres did not believe that
the crawling creature was an animal
not since he had seen those crimson
marks on bucklys cheeks

  they had been left there deliber-
ately-the brand of the killer even
the highest degree of intelligence
that an ape might possess would not
make him capable of that

ayres was convinced that the
crawling creature was z fiend in
human form possibly a native or
even a demented white man the way
the money belt that dan buckly had
been wearing had been torn from his
lifeless body indicated that the five
thousand dollars that dan had been
carrying just as ayres was now had
been missing

 someone had learned that they
were carrying enough cash to buy an
interest in that diamond mine in
south africa that their old friend
ed gordon had written them about

ayres bitterly regretted that dan and
he had discussed the matter so freely
there in that little dive in the coast
town near the mouth of the congo

  news traveled fast at times and
two men going alone into the brush
and carrying ten thousand dollars in
cash between them was tempting bait
for the human jackals of that part
of the country

  from the first the two men had felt
that they were being trailed it had
been an unusual noise in the brush
that had drawn ayres away from the
camp the previous night

he never had discovered what had
made it but during his absence
the crawling creature had found the
opportunity to get dan buckly-and
half of the wealth that the two men
possessed

  this morning after having buried
dan as best he could ayres had con-
tinued- leading south through the
jungle and across the veldt hoping
to reach ed gordon and safety be-
fore the thing that lurked in the
jungle got him also

 now he found that someone was
following had been sure of it for
the past hour and he believed that
someone or something was the crawl-
ing creature

  ayres searched the brush with his
eyes found that he could see noth-
ing turned and started once more
along the trail he was very much
alert he had grimly made up his
mind that whatever or whoever it
was that had killed his partner would
not get him in the same way

  he halted suddenly the powerful
big game rifle in his hands half
raised as he heard a crackling in the
undergrowth ahead a man stepped
into view and dix ayres stood star-
ing at him in amazement

 the man was a huge creature
fully six feet seven inches tall and
must have weighed close to three
the crawling creature



hundred pounds a grimy pith hel-
met rested on the top of the bushy
head of flaming red hair his cloth-
ing was torn and ragged and he held
a heavy rifle in one ham-like hand
there was a belt with an automatic
in a holster strapped around his
waist

  looks like i got company he
said as he stood gazing at ayres
this sure is a pleasant surprise
ayres did not speak but his lean
tall frame was ready for instant ac-
tion as he stood staring at the other
man the latter appeared big and
powerful enough to be that myste-
rious killer the crawling creature
who crushed mens heads in with one
mighty blow ayres was not taking
any chances

  whats the idea demanded the
big man with a grin you one of
them fellers that figures we aint be
properly introduced were both
white men aint we there aint no
reason for you being so damn high-
hat mister

  ayres realized that the big man
was an american just as he was
who are you he asked slowly
most people calls me lucky mc-
nally answered the big man you
aint trusting me for some reason-i
can see that but youre all wrong i
been watching you from the brush up
ahead there for the past five minutes
i could have plugged you easy if id
wanted-but i didnt me im a right
friendly guy unless somebody gets
me kinda perturbed

  lucky mcnally eh said ayres

he had heard the name before mc-
nally bore a reputation in this
part of africa of being a fighting two-
fisted adventurer a trader of sorts
who traveled the jungle trails alone
bartering with the natives for ivory
and anything else they might possess
that he deemed of value

  men spoke of lucky mcnally with

admiration and respect it seemed
hardly possible that this man could
actually be the crawling creature
and yet ayres was not sure

he thought swiftly and then de-
cided that his attitude toward
mcnally would be friendly but watch-
ful he had not forgotten dan
buckly and he was not taking any
chances

  my name is ayres dixon ayres
he said slowly i have to be care-
ful

 why demanded mcnally his
eyes fixed upon ayres lean tanned
face whats wrong

  something or somebody killed my
partner last night ayres answered
broke his skull with one blow
no wonder youre kinda cautious
said the big man one blow eh
his laugh was booming friendly
sure i know what youre thinking
ayres i look big and husky enough
to have done it but i didnt nobody
ever said that lucky mcnally
minded a good fight but they aint
saying that im a killer either

  im beginning to believe you
said ayres ive heard of you be-
fore and you dont look to me like you
might be- he hesitated deliberately
waiting to see if mcnally would fin-
ish the sentence for him

  sure i know you dont believe
that im this crawling creature
youre right ayres i aint but
when i was watching you a few min-
utes ago i seen something duck back
into the jungle when you turned
around and kinda half crawl away
mcnally frowned and ever since
i been wondering

  i thought someone was following
me said ayres

  there was said mcnally and
i got a hunch it is this crawling
whatever it is

  ayres nodded he was still sus-
picious if mcnally really was the


thrilling adventures

killer and ayres was not at all cer-
tain that he was not then he was
being very clever now saying that
he had actually seen something back
there along the trail making it seem
that the crawling creature was still
lurking somewhere in the brush near-
by

  look said mcnally suddenly
gazing over ayres shoulder there
is something moving back there

  dix ayres was no fool he did
not swing around with his back to
the other man that would make it
far too easy for mcnally if he did
happen to be the murderer

  ayres moved forward swiftly step-
ped by mcnally well out of the big
mans reach then swung around he
was standing behind mcnally and a
little to one side of him the heavy
rifle in his hands ready

far back in the shadows along the
trail he saw something moving
both he and mcnally raised their
guns to their shoulders at the same in-
stant and the roar of ayres jeffery
seemed like the echo of the big mans
 express rifle

  missed said mcnally lowering
his weapon too dark back there
beneath them trees he swung
around so that he faced ayres you
got a lot of sense he said ill
hand you that for not turning your
back on a guy you aint sure of if
i was in your place id a done the
same thing

  i havent forgotten what happened
to my partner last night said ayres
grimly ill believe that youre not
this crawling creature when we get
it mcnally

  fair enough said the big man
only tell me one thing why was
your partner killed

  ayres hesitated an instant before
he answered this mcnally was a
hard-boiled adventurer if he knew
that the man he now talked to was

carrying five thousand dollars in a
money belt around his waist it might
prove a temptation even though he
was not actually the crawling
creature

  because my partner was carrying
all the money we owned said ayres
slowly five thousand dollars that
we were going to use to buy a share
of a diamond mine with

  five thousand eh in cash
yes-and it was missing from
poor dan bucklys money belt when
i found him dead

  dan buckly

that was my partners name
hells hinges exclaimed mc-
nally excitedly was this buckly
a little wiry guy sandy hair with a
scar over his right eyebrow

  thats dan all right why
because i know him me and dan
used to be friends when he was in
mexico about five years ago mc-
nally scowled evilly as he gazed at
the jungle that surrounded them
and this crawling creature got
him the rotten offspring of a so-
and-so listen ayres im gonna get
this what-is-it-if its the last thing
i ever do dan buckly pulled me
out of some tough spots-and im
gunning for his murderer from now
on

so am i said ayres calmly i
thought he or it would follow me-
might give me a chance to get a shot
in where it would do the most good
thats one reason why i started along
the trail this morning the other
reason was that i wanted to get back
out to the coast and get a boat down
to cape town where ive got a friend
waiting to learn what became of dan
and myself

  i get you this friend was figur-
ing on giving you and dan an in on
this diamond mine aint that it
just about ayres nodded

  then dont be foolish said me-
the crawling creature



nally you dont want to leave this
jungle until you get your five thou-
sand bucks back and we get this
crawling creature

  yes i know said ayres but
i would like to know just what this
murderer is whether it is a man or
a beast

 a thought struck him and he
swiftly told mcnally about the two
xs that had been drawn on buckly
cheeks with the murdered mans
blood

  huh said the big man as he lis-
tened sounds to me like this
crawling whosis is a man-and a
crazy one at that im figuring that
no guy in his right mind is going to
pull a trick like that

  thats the way i feel about it
said ayres

 now that he knew that mcnally
had been a friend of bucklys he was
beginning to have a bit more faith in
the big man he did not trust him
entirely for it might be a trick this
claim of friendship upon mcnallys
part

  the man who had killed dan had
seen his face would doubtlessly be
able to remember it clearly enough
to describe it as lucky mcnally had
done and ayres did not remember
buckly having ever mentioned the
fact that he had known mcnally

  that in itself did not prove very
much for dan had never been in-
clined to be overly talkative regard-
ing his life in the years before ayres
had known him

what mcnally said about having
known buckly in mexico might
be true and then again it might not
but the way things stood at present
ayres was willing to give mcnally
the benefit of the doubt

  it aint a native trick either said
mcnally as though half thinking
aloud it might be- he broke off
abruptly and shook his massive head

no if i told you that youd think
i was nutty myself

 what do you mean ayres
looked at mcnally curiously

  never mind said the big man
starting back along the trail come
on i got a hunch that this killer aint
got any gun if he had he would
have taken a shot at us both long
before this he paused suddenly and
turned to ayres as a thought struck
him say what did you do with
bucklys gun he had one didnt
he

of course ayres answered i
buried it with him

  that was bright said the big
man again moving back along the
trail ill bet youll find that grave
dug up when we get back to it
you mean you think this crawl-
ing creature will want that gun
sure he will didnt we both just
take a shot at him well if he
knows were both after him hes
gonna want to be armed and ready
for trouble mcnally smiled as he
glanced over his shoulder at ayres
as the latter walked close behind him

  ive seen a lot of tough bozos in
my time and the reason im still alive
and kicking was because im always
willing to figure theyve got as much
brains as i have this crawling
creature may be crazy but he aint
dumb

  they went on back through the
jungle following the trail that had
evidently been made by the natives
for it was too narrow to have been
an elephant spoor

  they had ceased talking and their
faces were hard and grim the set
expressions of their countenances
brooded ill for the creature be it
man or beast that lurked somewhere
amid the brush

  heat rose in waves from the vege-
tation all about them there was no
sound save the faint crackling of


thrilling adventures

twigb and leaves beneath their feet
constantly their gaze searched the
shadows peering into the dark place
beneath the trees ever on the alert
for some indication of the presence
of the crawling creature but noth-
ing moved

  as they passed beneath the low
overhanging branches of a big tree
ayres who was walking a few paces
behind mcnally brushed against
what appeared to be a bit of green
vine it snapped up into the air then
dropped over his head and tightened
suddenly drawing him back and
pulling him half off his feet

  he uttered a hoarse cry and mc-
nally wheeled abruptly the rifle in
his hands ready the big man cursed
as he saw ayres swinging in the
air hanging by a rope made of a vine
that was tight about his throat

  mcnally fired as he saw a shadowy
object make a flying leap from the
tree above-land in the brush with a
crash and then disappear the big
man did not wait to see if his shot
had hit its mark hecould tell that
ayres was strangling

  mcnally leaped up and caught the
vine in his huge fist just above ayres
head the combined weight was too
much and the vine broke dropping
both men to the ground

ayres tore at the noose that was
still around his neck as he lay
there it came away-and he gasped
for breath

  that was close murmured mc-
nally as he got to his feet too
damn close if you hadnt yelled i
might not have known what had hap-
pened until it was too late

  i know said ayres weakly rising
and picking up his gun did you
get him when you fired

  afraid not said mcnally what
a jump that was there was a scowl
on his big face as he gazed up at the
tree i said it wasnt a native but i

aint so sure of it now that vine
trick-is one that a black might think
of doing and if it was a white man
-he sure knows how to jump

rphey both stood listening far off
to their left they heard a faint
rustling in the jungle it gradually
faded into the silence

  he got away all right said mc-
nally guess i missed him he
smiled ironically reckon you figure
im a rotten shot-thats the second
time ive missed

  so did i once remarked ayres
evidently he hasnt dug up that gun
yet-if he really is going to do it at
all

  how far are we from where you
and buckly camped last night now
ayres looked around him about
a mile i guess-maybe less

 come on then said mcnally
starting ahead again hes got a
head start hell get there first
they went on dix ayres was
very careful to avoid anything along
the trail his neck still ached from
that vine rope he no longer had
any suspicions regarding lucky mc-
nally the attempt to hang him with
the vine had convinced him that the
crawling creature was actually some-
one else there was not the slightest
doubt of that

  they reached the clearing in which
ayres and buckly had camped the
previous night without encountering
any further trouble ayres lead the
big man to the shallow grave he had
dug for dan buckly

  look exclaimed ayres as they
reached it you were right

  the grave had been dug up and the
heavy rifle that had been lying beside
bucklys body was missing

  that guy sure moves fast said
mcnally he got here first all
right the gun is gone

 ayres was not looking at the
grave his eyes were fixed upon the
the crawling creature



back of mcnallys huge hand there
was a black streak on it that might
have been dried blood

  but that was impossible mcnally
wasnt the mysterious killer-that
was the individual who had been
ghoulish enough to rob bucklys
grave to steal the gun of a dead
man

there was one thing about that
gun that ayres had not told mc-
nally-the rifle was not loaded
ayres had removed the cartridges
and put them in his own pockets he
had been intending to tell the big
man that but now he decided
against it he did not have any par-
ticular reason for not doing so-save
the faint improbable suspicion that
had just entered his mind

  he realized that his suspecting the
other man was hardly fair lucky
mcnally had rescued him when he
had been caught in the jungle by the
vine rope in the hands of someone
who obviously intended to hang him
if mcnally was the real killer he cer-
tainly would not have done that at
least it did not seem very probable
to ayres

  looks kind of bad said mcnally
gazing around him anxiously if
this crawling creature has the gun-
and we know he has then were in a
tough spot ayres

  we are said ayres watching the
other man closely what are we
going to do about it

  try and get him first said the
big man listen i got a hunch
that this guys somewhere around
here suppose we separate and see if
we cant dig him out huh

  all right said ayres that
might be a good idea

  its a swell one said mcnally
you go that way he pointed into
the jungle toward the south and
ill go this he nodded toward the
west circle back here and meet me

in about an hour-we ought to have
some trace of this killer by then

  ayres stood watching as the big
man moved across the clearing and
entered the brush he stood with his
eyes fixed upon mcnallys back un-
til the latter disappeared 

  then suddenly ayres turned and
started running toward a big tree he
ducked behind it swiftly and re-
mained hidden from view his move
was instinctive-and he did not quite
know why he had done it but he felt
there was some reason

  mcnallys having brought him all
the way back to this camping spot
did not seem as logical as it had at
first yet it had seemed sensible-
this effort to keep bucklys gun from
the crawling creature was it
though ayres wasnt so sure of that
now

  he realized that it was not know-
ing as he did that the gun was
empty but he had not told lucky
mcnally that lucky mcnally-dimly
ayres tried to remember something
that he had heard about the name

there had been some ironical rea-
son for mcnally having been given
the nickname he had heard men
who knew mcnally well laugh over
it but he could not quite remember
what it had been

  ayres turned and started into the
jungle he might as well do as mc-
nally had suggested and look for
the man who had murdered his part-
ner he did not think the search
would prove particularly fruitful

  if the crawling creature was
clever enough to escape as easily as
he had done from that tree back
along the trail he was not likely to
be found readily if he chose to hide

  for over half an hour ayres circled
through the jungle searching for
some trace of the hidden killer once
he heard a rustling amid the brush
but discovered that it was merely


thrilling adventures

some sort of a small wild animal he
was not interested in game at the
moment he had more important
things on his mind

finally he returned to the clear-
ing mcnally had not as yet re-
turned ayres went to bucklys
grave he stood frowning as he gazed
at it it had been filled in again-
and upon the soft dirt that covered
it had been drawn two large xs the
mark of the crawling creature

  ayres swung around as he heard
the roar of a heavy rifle and a bullet
thudded into a tree trunk just above
his head there was a crashing back
in the brush and then a second report
of a gun this time the bullet did
not appear to be aimed in ayres di-
rection it would not have hit him
anyway for an instant after the first
shot had struck he had ducked be-
hind the tree

  in a moment lucky mcnally came
running out of the jungle ayres
had him covered from behind the
tree he was taking no chances with
anyone either mcnally or the other
man had fired those two shots nearly
got him with the first one-and as far
as ayres knew the hidden killers
gun was not loaded

  ayres called mcnally where
are you

  right here said ayres from be-
hind the tree and ive got you
covered mcnally

covered exclaimed the big man
as he came closer what in hell for
just playing safe said ayres
you better stay right where you
are

  of all the fool idiots exclaimed
mcnally youre it here this
crawling creature takes a shot at
you i fire back at him-and instead
of being thankful like you should be
that im protecting you you cover
me with your gun are you nuts or
something ayres

bucklys gun wasnt loaded said
ayres i forgot to tell you that
mcnally stared at him for a mo-
ment and then threw back his big
head and laughed loudly

  what of it he demanded finally
didnt buckly have a lot of car-
tridges in his pocket-like we all
carry them at times i got a hunch
he did

  ayres began to feel rather foolish
the big man was right buckly ought
to have had a handful of cartridges
in his coat pocket ayres remembered
that was possible

  you sure are dumb said mc-
nally with a shake of his head do
you think this crawling creature
would go to all the trouble of dig-
ging up a grave in order to get a
gun and then not make sure it was
loaded you know damn well he
wouldnt

  i guess youre right said ayres
as he stepped out from behind the
tree the rifle lowered my error
mcnally

  forget it said the big man i
think i winged the killer but i aint
sure

mcnally glanced around and
then stood staring as he saw the
filled grave

  what the- he exclaimed strid-
ing closer who done this

  the crawling creature said
ayres at least those xs seem to
be his mark the man is insane
theres no doubt about it

  oh no he isnt said mcnally
hes just smart thats all he
knows those marks are gonna worry
us-and he is right

  i dont agree with you stated
ayres tricks like that are merely
childish-thats all-the products of
a demented mind i tell you the
man is a homicidal maniac

thats what you think mcnally
the crawling creature



glared at him but i got a hunch
youre all wrong

  all right said ayres we
wont argue about it

  it was growing late in the after-
noon ayres dreaded another night
in the jungle it had been dark when
the crawling creature had murdered
buckly and when the sun disappeared
he might strike again

  im going to take one more look
around said mcnally suddenly
you stay here

  ayres glanced at the big man as
the latter spoke mcnally was
scowling and he seemed to have
something on his mind he walked
away hurriedly and disappeared into
the jungle

  ayres seated himself at the base
of a big tree he could watch all
sides of the clearing save in back of
him from where he sat he had not
been there long when he began to
have the uncanny sensation that
someone was watching him he
looked around anxiously peering
into the undergrowth that surround-
ed the clearing but he could see no
one

  the fact proved nothing he still
felt that someone was gazing at him
he was sure that the hidden watcher
expected him to do something was
observing him for that reason but
what was expected of him

  ayres suddenly remembered some-
thing that he had been trying to re-
call for the past half hour as he
did so a number of things that had
puzzled him began to grow clearer
in his mind

the solution to the mystery of the
crawling creature was beginning
to take shape in his brain it seemed
impossibly fantastic-and yet the
more he thought about it the more
logical it seemed

  he got to his feet slowly looked
about him as though he half feared

that he might be watched he knew
that he was actually being observed
closely but he was playing a part
now

  again he glanced around he ap-
peared to be satisfied that he was
quite alone in the clearing he went
to the tree where he had just been
sitting leaned over as if he were
about to pick up something

  dont you fool whispered a
voice from the shadows of the jungle
near-by thats what hes waiting
for-to find out where youve hidden
it

  thats what i thought said
ayres calmly

  he stood up quickly shook his
head as though puzzled about some-
thing and then moved to another
tree and leaned down as he had done
before again he did not appear
satisfied he went to a third tree

  then suddenly swung around the
heavy rifle in his hands half raised
he looked all about him anxiously
then shook his head and seated him-
self again against the trunk of a
tree the rifle across his knees

fifteen minutes later he was still
sitting there as lucky mcnally
appeared out of the brush ayres was
idly tossing small objects into the
brush at his left as he finished do-
ing so he heard a very faint rustling
coming from that direction and
smiled faintly

  not a trace of that guy said
mcnally as he reached ayres im
still figuring that hes somewhere
around here though

  got one of those hunches of yours
about it asked ayres casually

  yes the big man nodded and
ive never gone wrong on one of my
hunches yet he looked at ayres
know what i think

 no ayres shook his head
what


thrilling adventures

  that this crawling creature is
watching us for some reason

  so do i said ayres

  huh mcnally looked at him in
surprise why do you think so
the same reason you do at least
i believe it is might be more sure
if i knew your reason exactly

  i aint telling you that yet said
mcnally he yawned and dropped
down on the ground a short distance
from ayres want to see if you can
figure it out yourself

  i see you carry an automatic
said ayres casually what is it a
 caliber

  yes mcnally nodded

  wonder how the killer ever got
the name of the crawling creature
remarked ayres it sounds weird
well ive heard the natives talk
about him said mcnally and they
say he kinda creeps up on his man
and busts his head in

  thats what he did to poor buckly
all right said ayres bitterly i
wish we could get him i owe that
to dan

so did i remarked mcnally i
told you that before told you i
was good friends with buckly down
in mexico ten years ago

 yes i know ayres nodded
only you said five years ago the last
time not that it matters

  naw i forgets dates easily
mcnally glanced about him its
getting dark a thought struck
him say didnt you and buckly
have any camping stuff

  of course said ayres i hid it
in the brush when i broke camp this
morning didnt want to be bothered
with it i was after the crawling
creature and i wanted to travel
light

 thats a good one mcnally
laughed when i first seen you
you was beating it away from this

part of the jungle like all hell was
after you

  i told you that was because i
hoped the killer might follow me
sure you did but ive got a hunch
you were wrong-that you were
lying mcnallys tone changed sud-
denly ive been playing with you
long enough ayres where is it
wheres what asked ayres ap-
parently unconsciously turning so
that the muzzle of the rifle across his
knees covered the big man i dont
understand

  oh yes you do the big mans
voice was heard i mean the other
five thousand bucks you hid it
somewhere i want to know where
so thats it exclaimed ayres
mcnally moved with lightning
speed he flung himself at the other
man

  a heavy hand clasped ayres by the
throat and dragged him to his feet
held him with his left hand
mcnally reached for the automatic
in the holster at his belt

 tell me where you hid that
money he growled or ill give
you the same thing i gave buckly
dix ayres saw death staring at
him from those glittering eyes in the
big distorted face that gazed into
his he knew that any moment the
automatic might crash down upon his
head cracking his skull

  ill tell you he gasped its-

from the jungle behind mcnally
there came the roar of a rifle a
bullet plowed into the big mans
shoulder spun him half around he
released ayres and turned swiftly
the automatic in his hand as the
automatic barked rapidly ayres
dropped to the ground

 mcnally howled with pain as a
second bullet from the rifle of the
marksman in the brush scared his
cheek the automatic was still bark-
the crawling creature



ing as the big man turned and
dashed madly across the clearing

  again the rifle boomed mcnally
threw his hands above his head
stumbled and then rolled over to re-
main there limp and motionless

  looks like we got him said a
voice and a tall well-built man
walked into the clearing a heavy
rifle in his hand thats the crawl-
ing creature otherwise known as
bull dill the craziest killer that was
ever let loose

i know said ayres and youre
lucky mcnally

  right the real mcnally looked
at him in surprise but how did
you figure that out

  i had heard about you said
ayres finally remembered that
they had called you lucky because
you hated hunches this killer here
said that he was mcnally but he was
talking of having hunches about
something

  youre right so far mcnally
grinned what else

  i had heard that one of the
strange things about lucky mcnally
was that he never cursed this dill
here cussed plenty then i got to
figuring things out i knew that dill
had brought me back here for some
reason then i remembered that
when i first met him i told him that
the crawling creature had gotten all
the money that dan buckly and i
had he knew that i was lying-for
he had learned somewhere that dan
and i had ten thousand between us-
yes i knew that said mcnally
early last night this dill found my
camp planned to kill me just as he
did your partner but i got away i
had to move fast though to do it and
i had to leave my gun behind i
followed him saw him murder buckly
-but i was unarmed and helpless-
so i could do nothing then

 but why didnt you warn me
later demanded ayres

  i couldnt last night after dill
left here he picked up my trail again
i spent the rest of the night ducking
him in the morning i did follow
you mcnally smiled grimly both
you and dill took a shot at me back
there on the trail that was close

  later i climbed up in that tree i
planned to slip that noose over bull
dills head but it was dark-i
couldnt see very well and i got you
instead mcnally looked at ayres
earnestly im sorry old man
right then was when i certainly
played into dills hands he had
you convinced that i was really the
crawling creature im sure

  but you havent any hunches
about it ayres smiled i finally
figured it out that was why i pre-
tended to be looking for the place
that i had hidden the money belt i
knew that dill was watching me i
wasnt surprised when you warned
me from the brush i thought you
might be somewhere near-by sorry
you had so much trouble digging up
the grave to get bucklys rifle-and
then found it wasnt loaded

  yes that wasnt so good you
showed a lot of sense when you
tossed me those bullets as you were
sitting there by the tree if you
hadnt dill might have got you

  i know that dill tried to bluff
me into believing that you had done
the shooting after he went into the
jungle and took a shot at me-but i
knew bucklys gun wasnt loaded-
and i was almost positive that poor
dan didnt have any cartridges in his
pockets but i wasnt quite sure
when i saw that the grave had been
refilled i knew that whoever the
crawling creature was he was ab-
solutely insane

  you were right said mcnally
smiling and i havent got a hunch
about it

chapter i
amok

to the north lies tibet a
vast arid terrain whose in-
fertile sands hold fast
through all the centuries a thousand
terrible secrets of the past to the
south is india the over-populated
peninsula whose people are many
and mysterious whose history is un-
written but not unknown whose
heritage is one of exploitation and
suffering

but between these two vast realms
of antiquity lies assam whose claim
on the past is even more secure
assam where the outposts of civili-
zation have failed to stretch their
powerful arms assam which is still
dominated by ancient ritual where
weird and cruel things happen in the
name of religion where the gods
are revered and man-made machine
is unheard of

  tibet has been ravished and ran-
sacked by the anthropologists map-
ped and charted by the explorers
india has been conquered and yolked
by the white man

  but assam remains what it has al-
ways been-free untrammeled un-
conquered and impenetrable

  if the white man must travel from
the northeastern corner of india into
tibet he goes not through assam
he travels perhaps some few hun-
dred miles further but he considers
the extra mileage well worth the
trouble

  he misses the certain death that
lurks in the poisoned arrows of the
abors and mishmis he misses the
torture and decapitation that the
nagas are so willing-aye eager to
mete out to him he escapes the on-
slaughts of the huge tailless monkeys
who can strangle a man with their
hairy hands he avoids the relent-
less mountain leopards which swoop
adventure and the chaos of the jungle

down from the heights of mighty
everest and dine on human flesh

  no the white man has traveled far
and wide he has taken his civili-
zation for better or worse to the
remotest corners of the globe but as
yet he has not made any forays in
that green vivid hell upon earth
which is assam

  thirty miles south of the indian
border is a tea plantation it is
owned by the nearest white man to
the assam frontiers it is owned by
the only caucasian who has ever
pierced that dangerous border and
returned to tell the tale it is owned
by a man who has seen the nagas
the abors and the mishmis face to
face and yet he still lives a fact
which accounts for this story

twenty years ago that tea plan-
tation was a small but rapidly
developing enterprise owned and
managed by robert stanley of bos-

ton massachusetts in his veins ran
the blood of pioneering forefathers
in his heart was the spirit of adven-
ture the desire to create order and
industry out of the chaos of the
jungle

  for three years he had worked the
plantation and now the business had
reached the stage where it had be-
gun to return a profit true that
profit was small but it gave promise
of great things promise enough at
least for robert stanley to send to
delhi for the wife and two children
who waited for him there

  so it was that mrs stanley rob-
ert jr and his elder sister doreen
took up residence on the stanley
plantation their life was happy and
uneventful the terrible jungle heat
beat down upon them yet they did
not mind the vast green chaotic
realm stretched out all about them
yet they were unafraid

 but there was one other white


thrilling adventures

man in their community to whom the
drumming of the suns constant heat
did something upon whom the sin-
ister spell of the jungle worked its
insidious effect

  tarvin the overseer had changed
from a huge healthy laughing man
into an emaciated muttering shifty-
eyed individual in the three years
he had stayed at the plantation

  stanley was worried about him on
a hot miasmic morning when it
seemed that the sun had added to
its already overwhelming power he
sent for the overseer

rparvin unshaved hollow-cheek-
ed and with eyes that refused to
meet those of his employer entered
the small screened room that served
as an office

  stanley regarded the overseer with
worried friendly eyes

  tarvin he said fraternally
youre not looking your best old
man suppose you take a trip back
home for a few months i can get
someone from calcutta to fill in
while youre gone

  tarvins roving eyes suddenly
came to rest on the others face a
maniacal gleam shone in his gaze as
he stared at stanley

  oh he mumbled trying to
get rid of me thats what i get for
working like a dog for three years
trying to get rid of me-trying-
of course not tarvin only im
worrying about you this rotten
climate seems to have got you im
only thinking of you thats all
dont want to go said tarvin
stanley bit his lip in chagrin he
was seriously worried about the
overseer the pounding sun seemed
to have done something to his brain
yet as long as he did his work and
there was no doubt about that point
stanley failed to see what he could
do about it

  all right he said shortly bet-

ter get the men out on the east field
this morning

  tarvin stared at him again and
the cunning shiftiness in his strange
glaring eyes made stanley uncom-
fortable

  this morning he repeated in a
queer hoarse voice

  of course said stanley why
not this morning

  if he spoke sharply it was because
the others peculiar behavior had sent
a little thrill of apprehension shoot-
ing up his spine

  not this morning said tarvin
its a feast day of the nagas

  stanley stared at him in amaze-
ment

  are you crazy man he de-
manded there arent more than
three nagas working for us if they
want to observe a feast day let them
do it but thats no reason why
everyone else should take a day off

  we must respect their gods as
much as we respect ours who knows
which religion is the true one we
cant afford the risk of angering their
gods

if amazement had showed in rob-
ert stanleys face before stark
stupefaction shone there now he
half rose from his seat and stared
dazedly into the others eyes what
he saw there was far from reassur-
ing tarvin blinked nervously his
pupils were dilated and a strange
light which stanley had never seen
gleamed there his mouth was open
and his wispy hair ruffled on his
head

  then just as he was about to
speak stanley checked the angry
words that were on his lips he
came to sudden realization tarvin
was undoubtedly mad the burning
sun the womanless waste of green
jungle had undermined his mind had
sapped his brain of its vitality

  it was this that stanley had seen
the lake of flaming death



slowly happening to his overseer
this was the reason for tarvina
strange behavior stanley dropped
back to his seat and resorted to
strategy

  all right tarvin he said quietly
perhaps youre right after all let
them all take a day off and you and
ill get some rest too

  to his horror tarvin uttered a
frightful cackle that sounded like the
laughter of a gloating harpy

  youre wise he croaked wise
not to offend the gods

  with that he turned on his heel
and walked slowly from the room

stanleys apprehensive eyes fol-
lowed the others soiled white
figure until it had passed out of
sight then quickly he left his desk
and went to the dining room where
his wife was playing with the two
children

  maida he said quietly to the
handsome woman who smiled a greet-
ing at him as he entered tarvins
gone off the suns got him i cant
get him to leave for a rest but we
must get a doctor here at once i
cant go myself youll have to do it
his wife rose to her feet she
showed no trace of alarm but she
did show her character as she re-
marked calmly

  i can start in an hour will you
send some of the boys with me
yes youd better take robert
too hes a trifle too young for me
to take care of ill look after
doreen and hurry darling tar-
vin was a good man once i want
a doctor here before he goes too far
perhaps we can still save him
from that moment on things
moved with a startling rapidity in
the tea plantation at sadiya mrs
stanley and her son robert rode off
escorted by half a dozen natives less
than two hours later

  robert stanley senior returned to

his office taking his daughter
doreen with him the child sat
playing on the floor under her
fathers eye as he busied himself
with the papers on his desk

  the plantation lay quiet and still
the natives glad of their days re-
spite though not quite understand-
ing why it had been granted them
slept in their quarters the sun
belted down on the palm-thatched
roofs it seemed that an air of grim
foreboding seeped from the jungle
and pervaded the whole atmosphere

  once while bent over his books
stanley suddenly glanced up and an
involuntary shudder shook his entire
body

  in his own quarters tarvin lay on
a soiled mattress and took a num-
ber of swigs from a square-faced
bottle of gin the more he resorted
to the bottle the more radiant be-
came the weird and evil gleam in
his wide eyes

  from time to time he muttered
some gibberish to himself then in
the early afternoon he sprang from
his bed and walked bareheaded out
into the murderous heat of the day

he stood before the little shack
that served him as a home and
glanced around the clearing not a
soul was in sight to his bleary
eyes the whole scene was glazed and
unreal as if it had been painted by
an exact hand on a cake of ice

  he blinked slowly as the bright-
ness almost blinded him then slowly
walked toward the large building
where stanley was working he ap-
proached quietly stanley did not
see him as he came to a halt just
beyond the screen and peered
through at the dim figures of his
employer and the child who played
innocently on the floor

  tarvin stood still and quiet accus-
toming his eyes to the shadows of
the room beyond
g

thrilling adventures

 then suddenly he drew a deep
breath and his eyes fairly crackled
with emotion his whole emaciated
frame shook violently he raised his
face toward the heavens and despite
the blinding light which threw itself
down upon him he gazed straight
into the center of the sun

  he works he said softly he
works on the feast day the gods
will become angry ah no for they
shall be propitiated-his sin shall be
wiped out and by my humble hands

he turned and ran toward his own
shack at the rear of it he
stooped and picked up a shining
hatchet with which his houseboy
chopped wood for cooking purposes
then like a madman he raced back
toward stanleys quarters

  he pushed the screen door open so
violently that it almost fell from its
hinges a houseboy on the veranda
took one look at his face and ran
howling toward the native quarters

  tarvin rushed across the room and
with his gleaming weapon held high
over his head he glared down at
stanley

  the planter looked up in amazed
alarm

  take it easy tarvin he said
whats wrong old man

  wrong fairly shrieked the over-
seer wrong you outrage the gods
then you ask whats wrong but the
wrong shall be retrieved by your
death your death

  stanley was a brave man he had
stared the reaper in the eye before
this but there was a weird quality
in the others voice an utterly crazy
vlint in his eyes that sent stanleys
heart to thudding he rose in his
chair and his voice shrilled to a
crescendo of alarm

 tarvin tarvin stop it you
foo youre mad youre-

  he never finished the sentence
tarvins hatchet swung through the

air in a glittering arc with all the
force of his arm behind it it struck
stanley squarely in the center of the
skull the planter slumped forward
on the desk blood streaming upon
his books

  tarvin stared at the ghastly sight
for a moment and an idiotic grin of
sadistic satisfaction crawled over
his mouth saliva dripped down his
chin

  he started suddenly as he heard
a shout from the native quarters
evidently the houseboy that had
run from him was bringing reinforce-
ments to investigate

  tarvin stood there irresolutely for
a moment then the terrible sob-
bing of a child came to his ears and
for the first time he took notice of
doreen stanley on the floor at his
feet

  stark horror was reflected in the
childs wet eyes as she stared trans-
fixed at the horrible thing on the
desk that had been her father

tarvin blinked and shook his
head as he essayed to collect his
mad thoughts then with the sud-
denness that characterizes the action
of a lunatic he lunged forward and
jerked the crimson weapon from the
dead mans head he stooped over
and picked up the squalling child
tucked it under his arm and fled
from the room

  past the shouting alarmed natives
who were on their way to stanleys
house he ran with his bloody hatchet
and the crying child right up to
the edge of the jungle where no
white man had ever dared to make
his way

  he pushed aside some thick growth
and leaped into the forest the child
screamed lustily the undergrowth
closed behind him

 a huge bronzed man detached
himself from the group of staring
natives and made his way to the
the lake of flaming death



place where they had seen tarvin
disappear

  at the edge of the jungle he hesi-
tated for a moment and stared at
the bright crimson stain on the
vernal greenery before him then
shaking his head he slowly returned
to the group

  in reply to their inquiring glances
he permitted himself but one word
of explanation he glanced signifi-
cantly at the sun and then uttered
the malay word which has become
synonomous with madness the whole
world over

 amok he said sonorously
amok

where the white mans civi-
lization is constantly undergoing
vicissitudes where the mind of
science performs its miracles year
after year but up on that hellish
border of assam twenty years like
the last three centuries brought
nothing save a dreary sameness

 the tea plantation upon which
robert stanley senior had met his
death still functioned under the
supervision of jamie ferguson a
dour scotsman who had taken
charge on that tragic day years
ago when the two living members
of the stanley family departed
from the scene of their fathers
death and their sisters kidnaping
and returned to the united states

  ferguson in sole charge for two
decades was called upon one day to
surrender his authority to a tall
bronzed young man with an assured
bearing and a clear and steady eye
robert stanley being of age and
wondering why the plantation which
his mother had told him was a po-
tential gold mine yielded nothing

save the small profits which fergu-
son sent them from time to time

  in the same small screened room
in which his father was slain by a
maniac some twenty years ago
robert met the scotch overseer
the youth extended a cordial hand
ferguson hesitated for a moment
then took it limply

  well ferguson said young bob
here i am of course youll have
a free hand as usual until i pick up
something about the business im
just a babe in the woods right now
its a bad country for babes
said ferguson dourly aye a bad
place indeed

  something in his tone caused bob
to look up the overseer was regard-
ing him queerly bob a stranger to
the country felt the others antagon-
ism keenly abruptly he brought
their aborted interview to a close

  thatll be all for now he said
ill see you in the morning
ferguson nodded and shuffled
slowly out in the dusk which was
fast enveloping the jungle

  bob stanley sat silently at the
desk which had once been his
fathers as he stared idly down at
the worn scarred top he saw a dark
brown stain his eyes became trans-
fixed upon it then suddenly he
shuddered without knowing why
without realizing that the stain was
a drop of his own fathers blood

dusk was fast coming upon the
jungle and the myriad of night
noises from the denizens of the thick
undergrowth came to his ears he
twisted uncomfortably in his chair
and lit a cigarette he was aware of
a peculiar foreboding

  he had traveled all day through a
terrible heat through a terrible
country and now that he had
reached his destination he had come
up against the dour foremans an-


thrilling adventures

tagonism he could not exactly un-
derstand why he felt disturbed but
somehow deep down inside him he
knew that all was not well he knew
that something malevolent some-
thing evil was approaching him

his houseboy approached and
served his meal where he sat
the white man ate mechanically
topped off the meal with a stiff
whisky and soda then lighted a
cigarette but even the food and
drink failed to remove the sensation
of worry that pervaded him

  he sat for a long time gazing out
into the purple tropical night
then at last with a sigh he rose
and took himself off to his sleeping
quarters

  running his hands through a suit-
case in search of a pair of pajamas
his fingers came into contact with a
heavy  which he had carelessly
tossed into the bag on that day
so long ago when he had left his
mother in boston

  he fingered it speculatively for a
moment examined it meticulously
and then acting on a sudden hunch
thrust it beneath his pillow

  bob stanley climbed into bed and
prepared to spend his first night on
his plantation his first night in this
weird unsettled country which was
blanketed with the mystic and
sinister spell of the orient

  myriad scented odors seeped from
the jungle into his nostrils the
scent was so heavy that it almost
drugged his senses to his ears
came the unearthly cries of the
beasts of the forests in search of
their prey monkeys chattered an-
grily birds raised whining cries to
heaven and bob stanley lay in his
net-covered cot and fought the
awful wakefulness that was upon
him

  then of course through th un-
familiar nocturnal noises of the

jungle came a more familiar sound
bob stanleys muscles tensed his
ears became alert again came the
sound of a human footstep

  with his left hand he slightly
raised the netting that covered the
bed while with his right he reached
for the loaded weapon which reposed
underneath his pillow the golden
tropical moon outside was obscured
by the towering trees at the edge of
the clearing in which the houses
were built

bob strained his eyes through the
darkness he saw nothing but
his ears warned him that a door had
slammed somewhere then once more
he heard the patter of naked feet

  suddenly looming up before him
black against the blackness of the
room he discerned the figure of the
most gigantic man that he had ever
beheld his heart thudded and with
a tremendous effort he sprang from
the bed his revolver gripped firmly
in his hand ready for action

  before he could level the weapon
at the intruder a powerful hairy
hand gripped his wrist frantically
bob clenched his left fist and swung
with all his strength at a point
where he judged the intruders jaw
should be

  his fist crashed against something
hard and hairy he heard a guttural
grunt in the darkness the hairy
hand on his right wrist gripped
tighter then a long arm reached
out and seized him by the throat

  bob fought desperately but as the
battle continued he was aware of a
sickening feeling of terror in the pit
of his stomach this adversary
with whom he struggled for his life
seemed more animal than man the
terrible strength the hairy arms and
body the inarticulate grunts all in-
dicated that some human beast some
crctin was bent on exterminating
him
the lake of flaming death



   in desperation he called but
who are you speak to me if
you are a man speak to me

   but the only answer to his frantic
supplication was another throaty
grunt which rasped against his ear
drums

cold sweat stood out on his
brow his breath came in short
sharp gasps his muscles felt as if
they had become frozen as if a thin
glaze of ice held them in an iron
thrall the fingers that held his
 went inert beneath the terrific
pressure on his wrist the gun fell
clattering to the floor

   something hairy brushed his cheek
and the awful pressure on his throat
forced him to his knees then sud-
denly a silver shaft of light swept
through the room as the jungle
moon rose higher with a desperate
jerk bob forced his eyes upward
then as he saw his adversary for
the first time bathed in the ghostly
light of the moon his pupils dilated
in utter horror and his heart became
a leaden spiritless thing

   for bending over him staring into
his face with wicked murderous
eyes was a huge hairy monkey in
a single flash he knew he had
already despite his short stay in this
country heard of the powerful tail-
less monkeys of the region who could
easily strangle a man now on his
first night he had met one of them

the grip on his throat grew tighter
and tighter the little gleam-
ing eyes that burned into his own
became glazed with yellow hatred
bob stanley stared blankly into
those relentless eyes and waited
for the doom that was surely upon
him then one of those quirks of
fate upon which hang such vast
things occurred

   the animal intent on the atavistic
emotion which impelled it to kill

jerked forward suddenly to deliver
the coup de grace as it did so the
protruding elbow of its hairy arm
came into sharp contact with the
edge of bobs bed the simian gave
vent to another guttural grunt and
as the pain shot through its arm its
tense hold on the white man was
for a moment weakened

   frantically bob summoned all his
 flagging energies and exerted every
 ounce of his waning strength to take
 advantage of the opportunity which
 chance tossed him

   with a tremendous effort he flung
 himself clear of the beasts grasp
 his right hand swept the floor
 hastily his relieved fingers came
 into contact with the cold butt of
 the 

rphe monkey turned sharply its
wide arms outstretched once again
to seize the victim who had escaped
its hold the horrible hairy arms
reached out once more bob backed
up two paces his finger constricted
on the trigger of his weapon a
sharp report cracked through the
room twice more the weapon
spoke its belated message

  the black brute before him
dropped with a heavy thud to the
floor panting and dripping with
sweat bob stood over it the still
smoking pistol held in his hand he
stared wild-eyed at the inert black
heap at his feet circled weirdly by
a halo of silver moonlight

   then with trembling fingers he lit
 a match and a moment later the kero-
 sene lamp in the room cast its
 flickering light over the ghastly
 scene the huge black beast lay
 wallowing in its own blood on the
 floor of the room bob still breathed
 hard as he crossed to a small table
 and picking up a long bottle poured
 himself the stiffest drink of whisky
 that he had ever taken


thrilling adventures

  he was still panting when a dis-
creet knock came at the door

  come in he called exerting every
effort to keep his voice steady

  the door opened slightly and the
timid countenance of one of the
houseboys thrust itself through the
jamb

 i hear shot he announced
gravely i come see what trouble
if any

  despite his feelings bob grinned
at the boys massacring of the
english idiom

  its all right he replied with a
casualness which he was far from
feeling i just killed this beast
drag his body out of here and send
for sahib ferguson

  the black boy bowed

  i go get help and sahib fer-
guson

his shining face disappeared from
the doorway and for a moment
bob was left once more with the
horrible corpse which had almost re-
versed the present order of things

  presently ferguson accompanied
by three natives walked into the
room the overseer calmly surveyed
the creature that lay dead at his feet
deliberately filled a worn pipe and
snapped an order in dialect to the
boys the trio of blacks bent down
and dragged the bloody hairy thing
from the room

  bob who had complete control of
his nerves by this time turned to
the overseer

  how do you figure that fergu-
son he asked bruskly

 the scotsman shrugged brawny
shoulders who knows he asked
strange things happen in the
jungle

  they do concurred bob when
a monkey has enough intelligence to
open a door with a spring lock
without a key i can say that i most
certainly agree with you

  he watched the other closely to
watch the effect of his words the
overseer maintained his poker face
however and said youll learn that
even stranger and more dangerous
things can happen here youre not
in america now

  he took a deep puff at hi pipe
and before bob could frame a reply
he turned on his heel and quitted the
room leaving a frowning puzzled
youth behind him

chapter iii
magic

bob stanley awoke with
the chattering of the gaily
plumed birds that greeted the
tropical dawn in the huge trees out-
side his room for a moment he
blinked dazedly at the glare of the
sun which poured into the room then
stretching and orienting himself to
his surroundings he sat up in bed
and reached for a cigarette

  as he lighted it his eye became
fixed to a number of dull red stains
of the floor the sight of the tail-
less monkeys blood brought back to
his mind the weird events of the
night btfore he dressed slowly and
meditated

  as he had remarked to ferguson
already it was odd-even in such an
odd country-that a mammal could
open a yale lock without a key it
would have been odd enough if the
monkey had achieved the feat with
a key but under these circumstances
it was almost impossible

  bob already knew something of the
tragedy which had overtaken his
father and sister two decades ago
at the plantation but all the details
of the affair he had never learned
his mother had always been loath
to speak of it and knowing her
desire to forget he never pressed
her

 but now he found himself won-
the lake of flaming death



dering if the attempt on his life of
last night could conceivably have
anything to do with those terrible
happenings of so long ago

  he pondered this question all day
as ferguson showed him over the
plantation and as he pondered
he kept a close watch on the over-
seer for it seemed to him from the
mans obvious antagonistic attitude
toward him that a clue to the mystery
might be had but ferguson evi-
dently was a man who knew how
to keep his own counsel who knew
how to maintain an ingenuous poker
face

 neither of them mentioned the
affair of last night to the other and
bob did not speak of the idea that
came to him that afternoon instead
he put it into operation as soon as he
had finished his evening meal

 he instructed the houseboy to
saddle his horse and without con-
fiding to the overseer he mounted
and started off down the trail that
ran alongside of the jungle

he had not gone three hundred
yards when to his amazement he
saw the figure of ferguson appear
from the thick brush at the side of
the road and start walking up the
path toward him he reigned in his
horse but before he could speak the
overseer said

  danger lurks on the jungle trail
at night my boy

 bob stung by his patronizing
tone retorted sharply it doesnt
seem to bother you much

  it wont bother me replied the
other with a mirthless grin but if
youre riding for pleasure id not
suggest this route

  im not riding for pleasure said
bob im going down to see the
british agent in sadiya

 ferguson frowned youll not
find him partial to social calls he
commented

  i told you this wasnt a social
call its business-grim business
again the scotsmans face clouded
characteristically he shrugged his
shoulders and continued his walk up
the path bob watched him for a
little while

  well he told himself i guess
i talked too much that time but that
guy gets my goat

  he tapped the horse lightly on the
flank and the animal trotted along
the three mile jaunt to the settle-
ment of sadiya where four white
men including the representative of
the british government lived

creighton his majestys agent
for the sadiya district was a typi-
cal insular englishman ferguson
had not exaggerated when he had
said that he would not relish a social
call he didnt

  he greeted bob with the strained
hospitality of a man who sees a duty
to be done and does it even though
he is not particularly enthusiastic
about it

  he ushered bob into the living
room of his bungalow poured him a
whisky and soda and said with the
air of a man who wishes to come to
the point at once

  and what can i do for you mr
stanley

  i dont quite know confessed
bob but some strange things have
happened to me since my arrival here
yesterday and i wondered if perhaps
you could throw some light on the
subject

  creighton sipped slowly from his
glass and said nothing despite his
cool reception bob related his story
emphasizing fergusons strange be-
havior and the episode of the monkey
of the night before but if he had
thought that his tale would cause the
englishman to evince the slightest
interest he was disappointed


thrilling adventures

   creighton sat back in his chair and
puffed thoughtfully on his cigar

   i think youre inclined to exag-
gerate mr stanley he said at last
this country is new to you its a
dangerous and mysterious place im
afraid youve let it undermine your
imagination ferguson seems all
right to me dour scotch but on
the level the monkey undoubtedly
forced its way into your room some-
how but i fail to see any connec-
tion between that and ferguson

  as i told ferguson monkeys
dont unlock doors but let that
pass if you dont see any connec-
tion between that episode and my
foreman perhaps you see a link be-
tween these things and the peculiar
death of my father twenty years ago
for a moment the others eyes
beemed to light with interest then
just as suddenly creighton became
bored again he shook his head

  no he said im afraid i
dont i dont know much about
your fathers death i came here
after that though of course ive
heard of it but i still believe that
youre simply worked up by the gen-
eral exotic air of this place in
fact-

he never finished the sentence for
as if in direct refutation of his
words there came a single staccato
thud upon the door it wasnt a
knock no human hand could have
delivered such a powerful blow
rather it was a sharp staccato crack
that brought both men to their feet
simultaneously

   bob was the first to the door he
flung it open and then stood staring
open-mouthed at a quivering shaft
in the top panel for there plainly
revealed in the platinum argent of
the moon was stuck a shaking arrow
whose point was deeply embedded in
the wood

  he reached up and seizing the
shaft tugged at it with all his
strength the weapon was encased
in cobra skin and upon its tip was a
dark red stain as if it had already
achieved the purpose for which it
was made

  bob looked up whats this he
said looks like-

and then for the first time he
saw the englishmans face
creighton had at last lost his com-
posure his red beefy face had sud-
denly evolved to a pasty white the
eyes which had seemed so dull and
bored a moment ago were now dis-
tended and flooded with fear he
took a single pace toward bob and
with a nervous gesture snatched the
arrow from the americans hand
trembling fingers ran along the
cobra skin then he flung it on the
table and hastily gulped his whisky

  my god he ejaculated then fell
back in his chair

  bob was staring at him in amaze-
ment

  whats the matter he de-
manded excitedly what on earths
the meaning of this

  creighton pointed weakly to the
arrow lying innocently on the table

  that he said in a faint voice
its the poisoned arrow of the
nagas the warning of danger and
death from the northern hijl tribes

  before bob could question him
further a knock on the door was
followed by the entrance of two men
who regarded the englishman with
alarm

  i thought i saw an arrow shot at
your i oor said one so i-

  he broke off as he perceived the
thing of which he spoke lying on
the agents table excitedly he
picked it up

  the second man apparently taking
but little notice of the weapon which
had so affected his companion
the lake of flaming death



smiled over at bob then extended
his hand

  my names macgraw he said i
guess youre stanley

bob shook the proferred hand
cordially this was the first
friendly greeting he had had since
his arrival creighton suddenly
realizing his duties as a host intro-
duced the other man as somers the
storekeeper

  whats it all about asked bob
when the formalities were over
youll have to explain it to a ten-
derfoot like me

  he noticed that creighton and
somer exchanged swift glances as
he spoke macgraw alone seemed
calm in fact with his shock of red
hair and innocent blue eyes it was
impossible to imagine him excited
about anything he had bob re-
flected the most placid expression of
any man he had ever met

  well said creighton slowly as
though the matter was distasteful to
him as you probably have heard
the tribes of assam arent exactly
sunday school children theyre
devils and murderers weve had no
trouble with them for a long time
now-until tonight

  he broke off and looked signifi-
cantly at bob

  then said bob you admit that
perhaps it has something to do with
me you see now that my theory
was correct

  creighton rose slowly whether
or not your theories are correct mr
stanley i dont know as a matter
of fact i dont want to know how-
ever i cant afford to involve the
government in a fiasco of this sort
i must request you to keep away
from here i do not want to an-
tagonize the tribes

  bob stared at him then as the full
significance of his words came to
him he said bitterly

   you fear that its me theyre after
and you dont want to risk your own
precious skin is that it

  creighton shrugged but somers
took up cudgels for him

  and why not he demanded
belligerently why should we en-
danger our lives we cant hold off
a whole native tribe simply as a per-
sonal favor to you

tob opened his mouth to utter
d the bitter words that welled up
from his heart but before he could
speak the most terrible sound he
had ever heard smote his ears

  it was a high throbbing plaintive
wail which somehow set ones very
heart to beating like a cold piece of
ice in the breast and it was more
than a wail it was a cry of murder
a cry of death a sound wrought of
suffering and doom

  bob cast a swift glance about the
room at the faces of the three others

  creightons face remained the
ashen pallor which had come to it
upon discovery of the arrow somers
shifted nervously and his fingers
-twitched macgraw nodded his head
slowly and silently as if corroborat-
ing some unspoken opinion of his
own

  whats that asked bob

  that said macgraw very quietly
and very seriously is the death cry
of the nagas

  and it means

  it means continued macgraw
exactly what its name implies it
means death

  to whom said bob tensely

  macgraw shook his head well
have to wait to find that out he
said

  bob looked at the others and the
fear he saw in their faces recalled
their attitude of a few moments ago

  very well he said acidly as he
walked toward the door i suppose
i am to assume that it means my
thrilling adventures

death in that case i wont endanger
you gentlemen with my presence
any longer

  he flung open the door and walked
into the moonlight compound be-
yond yet even as he went he heard
creightons sharp sigh of relief

he untethered his horse and
sprang to the saddle when he
heard a soft voice at his side

  dont take it too seriously
stanley said macgraw theres
danger its true but those two in
there get panicky rather easily
take a good nights sleep and ill
come up and talk it over with you
in the morning

  his reassuring words did bob a
world of good but before he
could even offer his thanks to the
red-headed irishman macgraw
had turned and walked back to
creightons shack

  bob rode off up the jungle trail
and the friendliness of the others
words almost banished the bitter
foreboding which was in his heart

  as he rode he tried to grapple
with the misery that seemed to be
pursuing him if as creighton had
implied the nagas sought his death
he was at an utter loss for an ex-
planation if as he firmly believed
himself ferguson had sent the
simian to his room last night he
was at a loss to explain that also

 but the thing upon which he
grimly and positively decided was
that one robert stanley jr was
certainly an unpopular man in this
desolate region on the assam
frontier

  as he arrived at the plantation
he noticed a light in fergusons
quarters and for a moment he was
tempted to confront the overseer and
ask him point-blank what it was all
about but a moments thought
showed him the futility of this
course he could pin nothing defi-

nite on the scotsman and it was
absurd to cxpect him to give his own
hand away he handed his horse over
to the boy who squatted on the veran-
da awaiting his masters return and
then made his way to his own sleep-
ing quarters

  he opened the door then stopped
abruptly on the threshold for
there crouched on the floor sil-
houetted in the moonlight sat a
horrible old crone the native
woman apparently intent on what
she was doing had not heard him
enter she bent forward and mut-
tered softly

  bobs hand dropped to the gun in
his pocket and he stood there still
and silent watching the uncanny un-
real scene before him the ema-
ciated old hag leaned forward and
touched something with her bony
fingers bob strained his eyes
through the gloom in an effort to see
more clearly

fastened to the leg of his bed
was a huge bloated python frog
the old woman passed her skinny
hands over the luckless amphibian
and spoke some gibberish in a tongue
that bob did not understand

 then suddenly she produced a
knife from somewhere in the folds
of her clothing with a swift sure
blow she severed the tether that held
the animal to the post again she
mumbled the words of her weird
ritual and with staring eyes trans-
fixed upon the puffed-up frog
watched it intently

  bob from behind her was no less
interested in the rite than was this
ugly priestess the frog hesitated
for a moment then summoning its
energies it essayed a leap bloated
as it was it teetered crazily for a
moment then moved toward the
north

 the woman gave a sudden ex-
clamation then came to her feet
the lake of flaming death



just as bob picking up a flashlight
from the table sprayed the entire
room with light

  but if he had expected the old
crone to show fear or surprise he
was disappointed she stared
steadily into the unwinking eye of
his electric torch and said clearly

  before the moonsoon sahib-to
the north-nizam ghat and beyond
there will you find her

  then her skinny arm reached out
and touched his sleeve

for a second he was astounded by
the fact that the words she had
spoken were perfect english and in
that moment of consternation the
hag glided past him through the
door and into the night bob stared
down at the ugly animal on the floor
then suddenly summoning his facul-
ties he ran through the door to cap-
ture the woman in order to question
her

  certainly she had not preceded
him through that doorway by more
than twenty seconds yet as he
flashed his light around the clearing
there was no sign of her she had
vanished completely as though the
jungle itself had swept forward and
snatched her in its tenacious grasp

  once again bob thought of con-
sulting ferguson and despite his
suspicions of the man decided that
after this last mad episode he must
speak to someone he stood upon
his veranda and called loudly

  ferguson he said in a tense
vibrant tone when the scotsman ar-
rived for gods sake tell what in
the name of god all this madness
means

  the overseer glanced down at the
bloated green figure on the floor
and his eyes narrowed then he
turned to bob

  whats happened here he asked
quickly and it seemed to bob that
his usually calm and unemotional

voice had become filled with alarm

  hastily bob related the story of
the old hag and her frog and as he
spoke he saw that the alarm he had
noticed in fergusons voice was re-
flected in the mans eyes

 you say she spoke to you in
english he questioned

  bob nodded yes now tell me
ferguson whats it all about i
know that you know more than you
pretend now whats the answer
hastily ferguson banished the
alarm from his features and resumed
his old implacable air

  i told you he said that many
queer things happen up here

  that seems to be your answer to
everything snapped bob frankly
i dont mind telling you that i think
youre lying

ferguson glanced up at him
keenly his mouth opened to
speak and then for the second time
that evening bob listened to that
terrible soul agonizing cry that he
had heard in creightons bungalow

  listen he said excitedly you
know what that means

  ferguson nodded too well he
said gravely open the door per-
haps we can see something

  bob turned the knob and opened
the door he was about to step out-
side when his foot struck something
soft and yielding he regained his
balance then looked down

 ferguson he cried look
thats the woman who was here with
the frog

  the overseer joined him in the
doorway and together they bent
over the prostrate form of the hag
who had worked her weird ritual a
few moments ago from her breast
protruded the feathered shaft of an
arrow encased in cobra skin bob
reached down and withdrew it

  the naga arrow he said softly
now what can all this mean


thrilling adventures

  it means said ferguson looking
bob squarely in the eye that for
some reason the tribes to the north
are threatening you take my advice
and leave immediately

  bob returned his gaze coolly its
not only the tribesmen who want to
get rid of me apparently he said
i guess that certain white men
would be glad if i cleared out too
but no ferguson im staying to
solve this business

it means death-horrible death
bob shrugged his shoulders
well then he said calmly what
of it better men than i have died
before this

 ferguson turned and left the
shack but before he went bob saw
the flicker of apprehension in his
eyes and he knew that at last he
had scored over the dour scotsman

chapter iv
mac

while bob was consuming
his breakfast the following
morning mac appeared on
the veranda delighted to see the
only white man who had treated him
like a human being since his arrival
bob sprang up to welcome him

 hello macgraw he cried pump-
ing his hand ill get a boy to take
care of your horse then you must
eat with me

 mac grinned

  ill eat he said but i have no
horse

 how did you get here
 walked

 walked in this heat in this
country i thought a white man
never walked

 mac sat down

 its quite evident he said
slowly that you dont know who
i am

  bob looked at him curiously

 no continued the other as a

matter of simple fact im a beach
comber who through a caprice of
fate has been removed from his
beach im invariably broke i have
no horse and so little credit that
creighton wouldnt lend me one if i
wanted it

  bob regarded him with a puzzled
look i dont quite understand he
said you mean you have no
money is that it

mac put his cup down with a
clatter that about sums it up
he said with a smile i wandered up
this way from mandalay and ran-
goon some time ago got tired of
my old haunts i finished up here
its an easy life i know enough
about medicine to make myself use-
ful the natives like me and i sell
them cures in the form of aspirin
for enough to live on then too
there are the orchids

  the what asked bob

 the orchids said mac the
jungles hearts of gold i call them
im very fond of them thats why
i stay here i like to look at them
you stay here asked bob in-
credulity showing in his voice you
give up the comforts of civilization
because you like to look at orchids
why not theyre more beauti-
ful and less selfish than any woman
civilization has to offer

  i see said bob well mac
unlike creighton i dont care how
broke you are your credits good
here

  thanks said the irishman but
enough of my affairs i take it that
you have some of your own

  plenty said bob grimly as he
proceeded to unfold the events which
had taken place since his arrival at
the plantation mac listened intently

 undoubtedly he commented
when bob had finished that frog
business was some sort of ritual
the very fact that the old woman
the lake of flaming death



selected your bedroom to work her
magic in indicates that it has some-
thing to do with you have you
any idea who the woman was

  i questioned the natives and dis-
covered that she was of the abors
though no one had ever seen her
about here before

 mac nodded gravely then she
came down from assam through the
treacherous jungle to work her
magic to take those risks it must
have been important for tribal
reasons

  bob nodded but what on earth
can it be and whats ferguson got
to do with it im sure hes mixed
up in it somewhere

  he probably is you say that the
old woman said in english there
will you find her

  she said befdre the moonsoon
-to the north-beyond nizam ghat
and beyond there will you find her

mac rose to his feet ill be
back in an hour he said i
think i know someone who can ex-
plain the frog business anyway
after we solve that we mastermind
the rest of it

  the day was uneventful and as the
cool of the evening came down upon
the plantation mac returned

  they sat together on the veranda
bipping their cool drinks bob
noticed that his new friends face
was usually grave

  any news he asked

 mac nodded slowly yes he
aid it was rather as i thought i

called on an old native patient of
mine a chap i had cured of malaria
he didnt know a great deal about
magic but he knew at least part of
the significance of the frog business
bob sat up eagerly in his chair
what did he tell you

  it means that the old sorceress
meant that you must travel north
beyond nazim ghat a far flung out-
post above the debang river thats
in the naga country and to my
knowledge no white man has ever
been there

 but why why must i go
there

  because said mac gravely be-
cause the frog jumped that way
bob look at him inquiringly

  yes continued the irishman
it seems that the ritual of the frog
is performed to discover in what di-
rection one must go in search of
what he must find

  what must i find

  mac shrugged answer that and
youve solved the mystery the
point is that the murdered old
woman was trying to tell you some-
thing something which evidently
concerned you and her religion as
well theres something of interest
to you lying beyond the jungle
god only knows what it is

  god-and possibly ferguson said
bob grimly

  at that moment there came ripping
through the air from the native
quarters a shrill scream

what new danger confronts bob what is the mysterious mission
indicated by frog magic does ferguson prove an enemy the

reac

a stirring story of paduan days of old and
the thirst for vengeance

by guido rengetti

author of days of the doges waters of strife etc

my lord carlos catalano the
duke of padua deserved
the love of his subjects if
ever a prince did and for the most
part he had it but it pleased fate to
give him as his deadly foe the very
man whose intelligence he needed
most his greatest vassal that plot-
ting black-hearted consummate vil-
lain luigi magnozzi

 for my part there are times when
i thank heaven that i am no
crowned ruler but only plain wil-
liam fraser english soldier of for-
tune and captain of the best band
of mercenaries that ever bore lances

  i can deal with my enemies with
cold steel and they seldom trouble
me twice whereas a prince though
as mortal as you or i with full as
many loves and hates must consider
policy and duty and the good of his
land-that is if he be a prince
worthy of his throne

  duke carlos felt little good-will
toward the man who had betrayed
him secretly and defied him openly
nevertheless when i had stormed
magnozzis stronghold and brought
its master into padua a prisoner and
he perceiving that his shrift was
likely to be a short one made a


the inn of treachery



humble plea for pardon my lord con-
sidered several things

  he considered that if magnozzi
met the death he merited his great
lands would descend in inheritance
to his daughter he considered that
this daughter had been married for
some years to a powerful venetian
noble

  he considered that venice was the
tireless rival of padua and that
should magnozzis son-in-law possess
such wide estates within the paduan
boundaries the peace of the duchy
would surely be menaced so he
pardoned his old enemy and wiped
the score clean

  now all this was of course none
of my affair nor did it concern me
overmuch if my lord the duke chose
to believe in this peace pact and to
assume that magnozzi would prove
his faithful ally in the future ac-
cording to the bond

 but when some time after my
lord conceived the mad idea of pass-
ing the night at an inn situated on
magnozzis lands and scarcely a mile
from his castle i felt that it was
full time for me to take a hand in
the game and open his eyes to the
risk he ran

  the three of us-duke carlos my
irish lieutenant dennis orourke
and myself-were riding back to
padua in the dusk of a sharp october
afternoon after paying a visit of
inspection to one of the dukes
fortresses we were late beyond our
expectation and it was now plain
that we could not reach the palace
until the night was far advanced

this prospect and the nip of the
night air set the dukes wits to
working he ended by pointing out
to us that there was small sense in
journeying through the cold when
within a few moments we would
pass a hostelry that could shelter us
till the morning

  if it were a rude place so much
the greater would be the zest of ad-
venture and it would amuse him
to be served by magnozzis people

  at this absurd suggestion i spoke
my mind as freely as ever man did-
and had my trouble for my pains

  oh you soldiers are too sus-
picious sir william the duke
smiled good-humoredly when i had
paused because magnozzi once
fought me must he always be my
enemy

  you do not like this gentleman
nor to be frank do i but he has
sworn allegiance to me on the honor
of his name and i choose to believe
him honest besides he will be quite
unaware of our presence at this inn
why should we fear him then

  my lord i said bluntly you
know no more of such gentry than
of-let us say the devil a most ap-
propriate comparison even to pass
through magnozzis lands without a
guard as we are now doing is an
imprudence i should never have
counselled

  as for this other piece of mad-
ness what proof have we that the
old knave might not pause at his inn
this very evening and discover you
there

  and what think you he would
do then knowing that you were ut-
terly at his mercy

the three of us exchanged words
for a time each stubbornly set in
his own belief then the duke
ceased smiling and narrowed his
eyes

  tonight i sleep at the inn yonder
is my decision clear he asked
haughtily that is well-for i am
the master i think sir william
fraser

  aye said i surlily and better
for you if you were not and if we
could drag you back to padua and
put you under the guard of my sol-


thrilling adventures

diers until it please the saints to
give you back your sanity

  he laughed at that for what he
called my soldiers bluntness always
amused him

  i fancy you would get little
help in such an undertaking from
orourke who is madder far than
i he retorted come i know why
you are so black you had planned
to spend this evening among the
roses with lady fraser ride on to
padua then if you choose and
messer dennis and i will enjoy the
adventure by ourselves

  i shook my head gloomily if
you are bent on such folly my place
is with you but in the name of
heaven grant me at least one boon
keep your rank and title to your-
self and do not let the people of
the inn know who it is they enter-
tain 

  very good he answered after a
reflective pause you shall have
your way my friend now are you
satisfied

  aye satisfied as damocles was
when the sword hung over his
head i returned grimly

  so we set spurs to our horses and
galloped toward where the distant
lights were glimmering through the
dusk

the inn kept by magnozzis people
was situated at the crossing of
two roads one of which ran in the
direction of padua while the other
led steeply up a hill to where luigis
fortress-castle perched like an eagle
among its crags

  a mean-looking roughly built
place it was by no means inviting
but we were all weary after the days
ride and the prospect of a fire and
a meal was tempting enough to cheer
us considerably as we dismounted
and hastened in out of the darkness
and the cold night air

  it appeared that there were no

other guests and we got a warm wel-
come from the wizened shrewd-eyed
little host and his dark silent hard-
mouthed wife-a rather unprepossess-
ing pair it struck me and much the
sort of fry that old magnozzi might
have been expected to harbor on his
lands

  there was a fire roaring in the
chimney-place and we promptly
gathered around it and began to
warm our chilled limbs

  an adventure sir william a true
adventure the duke kept repeating
as he glanced about the mean little
room

perhaps to one reared in palaces
it was though for my part i had
passed too much time among such
scenes to find them particularly en-
livening my host had vanished
immediately after our arrival but
his wife now appeared with our sup-
per and we fell on it with a good
appetite while dennis loudly voiced
his satisfaction with the meal

  sure and its yourself can cook
to the kings taste no less he in-
formed the woman never did i see
a better roast than the one im eating
now come tell us are you grow-
ing rich at your trade and do you
find him a good master this mag-
nozzi on whose lands you dwell

   tis mesilf am a stranger to
padua and know little of its nobles
but im hearing on all sides naught
but good things of your master a
rare nature they tell me gentle
charitable most faithful to those
above him and is it true now

  a good lord the woman assented
without a flicker of expression on
her hard face if she suspected his
irony she was far from showing it

  but the duke of padua i sug-
gested with a side glance at my
lord scarce merits the loyalty of
such a one a tyrant many people
say a spendthrift a proud addle-
the inn of treachery



headed rogue who plunges his duchy
into troubles of all sorts i know
nothing of this you understand i
have only heard it what is your
mind in the matter

she glanced at me quickly then
lowered her eyes

  i cannot say signor she told me
composedly i have never seen him
should he come here to my inn to-
night and be pleased to conceal from
me his name i would be none the
wiser

  on the last word she left the room
and went back into the kitchen and
we who remained stared open-
mouthed into one anothers eyes
had she recognized us i thought
that she had the duke maintained
she had not and dennis declined to
commit himself

  ye never can tell with a woman
he said solemnly wait till our host
comes back and ill soon reach the
bottom of this matter bless us all
and whats this

 it was the sound of galloping
hoofs in the near distance they ap-
proached rapidly there was a noise
of voices without and an instant
later the door was thrown open and
there appeared on the threshold
with a pair of black-visored scowl-
ing troopers behind him a white-
haired hawk-nosed keen-eyed gen-
tleman in a plumed hat and gold-
embroidered cloak whom with a
sinking of the heart i recognized as
luigi magnozzi

  in a flash i realized that the very
thing i had foretold had come to
pass

  at the sound of the opening of the
door the duke had turned in his seat
and the eyes of the two men met

  instinctively i reached back and
loosened my sword half-rising from
the table as i did so but what fol-
lowed gave me a surprise and made
me feel rather ashamed of my haste

  magnozzi stood a brief instant on
the threshold gazing at us in ap-
parent stupefaction then his look
turned to one of delighted welcome
and springing across the room with
an agility remarkable in a man of
his years he bent his knee before
the duke and fervently kissed his
hand

  welcome my lord welcome he
cried i had not known that you
were so near me a thousand par-
dons that i am so late in greeting
you but why pass a night in such
a place as this when my castle and
all in it are at your service i am
but now on my way home after a
day afield ride with me then and
let me house you suitably

tte turned to orourke and me
with a beaming smile apparently
quite forgetful of the not so far
distant day when he had ridden to
padua a prisoner in the midst of my
white company

  all friends of my prince are wel-
come here he informed us and
none more so sir fraser than you
and your brave lieutenant

  is it so indeed dennis demand-
ed quite audibly i recall a time
when you hid most rarely what ten-
derness you felt for us

  for my part i left the greeting
unanswered being in an agony lest
the duke should accept magnozzis
invitation and ride to the castle with
him to my relief however there
proved to be limits to my lords reck-
lessness

  i give you all thanks for your
courtesy signor was his gracious
answer but what you suggest is
impossible my friends and i are
weary from riding and are going to
sleep within the hour while early
tomorrow we must be on our way
home

  at some other time i will most
gladly enjoy your hospitality mean-


thrilling adventures

while it has afforded me pleasure to
see you for even so brief a moment

and he smiled into the fierce
eyes of the old man as com-
posedly as if he did not know him-
self to be in grave danger he had
courage

  magnozzi assented with protesta-
tions of deep regret and then he
flung a thunderbolt into our midst by
announcing his intention of not leav-
ing us at all

  the people of the inn are most
honest and trustworthy my lord
he began but nevertheless when my
sovereign honors my lands with his
presence i can surrender to no one
else the task of guarding him

  i will pass the night here by the
fire with two troopers we will not
sleep we will not close our eyes
ah my lord let me prove my devo-
tion let me make amends for my
late fault to you and show my grati-
tude for your kindness

  had i stood in the dukes shoes i
would have replied that to me a
guard of lions and tigers would be
preferable to one composed of mag-
nozzi and his men and i think the
old knave read my thoughts well
enough in the look i gave him

  nevertheless it was perfectly
plain that since we were in his
power we had better not start a
quarrel and i was not surprised to
hear my lord answer graciously
accepting his offer with every appear-
ance of trust

  seldom in my life have i been
more pleased at anything than i
was that night when the duke arose
and announced his intention of go-
ing to bed the evening had been
a well-nigh insupportable one and
had it been prolonged i fancy it
would have ended in a general me
in the course of which our ill-assort-
ed quartette would have cut one an-
others throats

  dennis who possessed no more
prudence than was to be expected
from one of his nation had been do-
ing his utmost to exasperate mag-
nozzi by a series of covert allusions
to his late rebellion and downfall
that gentleman had retorted by veil-
ed attacks on me and i had defended
myself with the best wit i could
muster the duke alone though
amused and annoyed by turns had
maintained a pretense of serenity
and sought to keep the peace an
hour or two of this congenial chat-
ter had exhausted us and we were
visibly cheered at the thought of
separating for the night

magnozzi guided us above-stairs
in person and ushered the duke
into a room which was he declared
the best in the place and later con-
ducted orourke and myself into the
one next to it

  good dreams sir william he
said lingering an instant on my
threshold and never fear but that i
will guard our prince well

  you had better do so i re-
sponded with a shrug of the shoul-
ders for if any harm came to him
there are some of his friends at
padua who would know the reason
for it

  he scowled at me blackly then
turned away

  you think yourself a clever man
sir william he snarled letting his
venom appear openly for the first
time that evening but there may
yet come a time when you will find
that others beside yourself can play a
winning game

  before i could answer him he was
gone slamming the door behind him

  this vague threat did not trouble
me much indeed i was growing
easier in my mind for surely i
thought had he intended us any ac-
tive harm he would not have waited
so long before attempting it
the inn of treachery



  weary but contented i stretched
myself on the rude straw pallet that
did duty for a bed

 praise heaven that my lord
showed wit enough not to pass the
night at the old rogues castle i
yawned to dennis that would
have been the end of us all i think
well tomorrow we shall be home
again and his mad jaunt will be
over

   tis the devil of a queer evening
weve had nevertheless he mur-
mured sleepily a meal at an
enemys inn a pair of innkeepers
whom that old spalpeen is after say-
ing he trusts which is a good reason
for suspecting them aye and a
night passed with magnozzi watching
over us save the mark-

  he halted on the very borderland
of slumber for a final thrust

  and theres another queer thing
sticks in my mind our friend there
was after saying he was on his way
home you recall but i heard the
hoofs of the horses in the distance
and i could swear on my soul twas
from the castle and not toward it
they came which proves-

his voice trailed into silence he
was asleep but he had left his
words behind him and i found that
they had banished all my desire for
repose propping myself on my el-
bow i thought steadily for a long
time

  i remembered that the innkeeper
had vanished immediately after our
arrival perhaps he had recognized
the duke and hurried to luigis
castle with the news

  the result of my musings was that
i rose took up my sword belt from
the floor buckled it round me and
bending over orourke shook him
ruthlessly awake

  what is it youre wanting any-
how he stammered

 hush i muttered my hand

across his mouth listen to me
dennis there is deviltry here i am
sure of it we have been blind not
to suspect sooner heaven send we
are not too late now follow me and
do it without noise if you hope to
keep this side of the grave

teing wide awake by this time
-d he obeyed me as if it were all
the most natural affair possible and
inch by inch testing each board lest
it should creak beneath our feet we
stole across to the door very slowly
i unbolted it and swung it open

  before us stretched the dark line
of passage and i tiptoed noiselessly
across it to the stairs thrust out my
head and stared down into the lower
room where magnozzi had informed
us he meant to mount guard

  the fire though nearly extin-
guished still lit the place with a
faint glimmer and i saw exactly
what i had expected to see there
was no sign of either luigi or his
troopers

  there was mischief afoot that was
certain and i could think of but one
way to cope with it rejoining
orourke i beckoned him to follow
me and we stole cautiously to the
dukes door i put my hand on it
and swung it open yes he had left it
unbolted quite as i had expected

  and now he was fast asleep had
he not been a ruler and therefore ac-
customed to such predicaments as the
present one i would surely have
dubbed him an imbecile and as it
was his complete unconcern toward
his danger irritated me extremely

  for a little while i stood motion-
less accustoming my eyes to the
darkness the couch itself was in the
shadow but part of the room was
illumined faintly by the moonlight
that poured through the window

  very slowly and cautiously i
made a tour of inspection and
found i must say little enough to


thrilling adventures

reward me there was but one door
and it had a firm bolt the paneled
walls seemed strong and solid the
window was high above the ground
and barred

  how anyone could enter i was at a
loss to conceive yet i was anything
but easy in my mind

when i had ended my search i
knelt down by the dukes pillow
stretched out a hand to seize his
shoulder and had the misfortune to
drive it against his eye instead
naturally enough he started up with
an oath and as the situation was
urgent i ventured to silence him in
the same fashion i had used with
dennis

 it is i fraser my lord i
hissed my hand still firmly over his
lips i have come to implore you to
sleep in my chamber and to permit
me to sleep here there is danger
tonight and i have discovered a way
to meet it

  he was anything but grateful for
my solicitude and he let me know
as much frankly there was no dan-
ger he maintained and he was out
of patience with my forebodings
was it not enough that his couch
was hard as any stone and must i
rob him of what little slumber he
could get

  throughout this tirade i kept my
hand over his mouth so that he could
formulate the words only in gasps
for i did not mean that he should
rouse the house

  my lord i muttered desperately
do you remember castagnaro i
won verona for you that day and i
saved your life as well if you are
grateful pay me now go into my
chamber and bolt the door and leave
me to my devices here

  i had touched the right chord at
last

  have your way tis a strange
return for such a service but each

man to his taste he grumbled and
rose from the couch

  when he reached my room and i
heard him bolt the door behind him
i shut orourke and myself into the
chamber and began my preparations

  these were of the simplest i piled
the covers of the couch into such a
shape as resembled in the shadow
the body of a man then i stretched
myself in the gloom near it with my
drawn sword beside me motioned to
dennis to do the same and hissed
in his ear a command for silence
he obeyed me to the letter for he
went promptly to sleep

  if any man thinks it a pleasant
diversion to lie in the dark waiting
for he knows not what danger i
wish him the same experience i had
that night

deneath that roof i could have
- sworn it on my hope of heaven
was some black plot for the sudden
removal of the duke and the soldier
who was the dukes right hand a
web had been woven round us and
it was drawing closer and closer be-
neath the cover of the darkness

  the fact that i did not see how
anyone could enter a barred and
bolted room made me but the more
uneasy since it lent a sinister note
to the affair the face of old mag-
nozzi rose before me lined bitter
fierce-eyed he was a most consum-
mate villain and something whis-
pered to me that tonight he played
to win

  the minutes dragged by the night
wore on and still nothing happened
the house was as silent as death
never a board creaked not a breeze
sighed without i lay very tense
and alert my eyes continually roam-
ing from side to side of the chamber
always seeking for a sign of the
peril that would presently come upon
me

  yet i say it to my shame no man
the inn of treachery



can remain watchful forever and at
last my vigilance began to relax a
little it was very late now the
moonlight was fading perhaps after
all i had deceived myself perhaps-

  another instant and i believe i
would have been in a doze my eye-
lids were falling and beneath them
i gazed dreamily at the one spot on
the opposite wall where the moon-
light still lingered praise god that
in that drowsy moment i looked
there and not elsewhere the one
glance was enough for it showed me
what sent sleep fleeing and brought
me back to my senses with a bound

  was i mad or was it true that
beneath my eyes the wall was sway-
ing outward a cold chill swept
over me i pinched my arm to con-
vince myself that it was not a night-
mare the thing was mysterious and
ghostly more hair-raising a thousand
times than the clash of arms and the
sound of spurs would have been

  not a sound broke the stillness of
the night but slowly and steadily
under the rays of the moon the
panel swung out and a black void
was revealed behind it then i un-
derstood there was a secret door in
the wall and our foes were coming
through it

magnozzi was the first of the

invaders to appear as i
watched he stepped lightly into the
room and paused for an instant
waiting until the two troopers had
emerged in their turn from the dark
hole

  each man carried a drawn sword
in his hand and if i ever read mur-
der in my life i read it then in the
fierce pale twitching face and
gleaming eyes of my enemy and the
grim dark countenances of his fol-
lowers

 nevertheless i was now quite
calm i put out my hand and grasped
orourkes shoulder and he stirred

  slightly then stiffened and lastly
drew a sharp breath satisfied i re-
leased him among his other ad-
mirable qualities he numbered the
power of waking with all his wits
about him and i knew he was al-
ready alive to our peril

 signor magnozzi tightened his
grip on his sword-hilt i could see
the muscles of his hand grow tense
in the moonlight he began to steal
forward testing each board before he
trusted it with his weight after
him dark and noiseless came the
troopers they were approaching
the couch in the shadow where they
believed that the duke lay asleep

as for me i did not stir though
the mounting anger in my heart
made quiescence well-nigh impos-
sible carlos catalano had pardoned
this man had treated him with the
generosity of a noble and princely
soul in return he was to be stabbed
in his sleep at a roadside inn

 magnozzi was very close to me
now crouching creeping a moment
more and i felt his quick hoarse
breathing almost against my cheek
he bent toward the couch raised his
hand leaned forward to strike then
i sprang to my feet and knocked up
his sword with mine

 on the instant bedlam reigned
about us magnozzi started away
with a choked cry of furious baffle-
ment and i pressed him backward
in a frenzy of rage allowing him
small time to collect his wits

  ah would ye then ye murdering
divils i heard orourke shout with
an exultant laugh and knew that he
had fallen with enthusiasm on the
two troopers

 doubtless they were picked
swordsmen and desperate fighters
but i did not think the two of them
would get beneath the irishmans
guard

for my part though to fight in
thrilling adventures

the dark is not childs play i have
enjoyed few things as i enjoyed that
combat since to have killed mag-
nozzi too easily would have lessened
my pleasure i was glad to find that
he possessed an unusual skill our
blades crossed and recrossed ringing
together sharply yes he was clever
and cool too already he had recov-
ered from his fright and was be-
ginning to attack as well as defend

  i	recalled grimly that he was said
to have passed much of his life in
france well certainly he had
studied fencing there

through the clash of steel i
could hear dennis laughing and
jesting as he fought but i had small
leisure to heed him magnozzis
breath was coming fast he was learn-
ing what manner of swordsman he
had against him and his courage
weakened as i drove him steadily
back

  gilberto andrea aid me he
panted over his shoulder to the
troopers

  is it your cut-throat friends
youre wanting sure and theyre
engaged elsewhere and most urgent-
ly orourke mocked from the
other side of the room

  magnozzi gasped and i will not
deny the sound was sweet to my
ears

  it is best before you come to stab
a sleeping man to be sure that he
is not awake i said grimly as i
parried his thrusts above all it is
best when the man chances to be
catalano of padua a great and noble
prince who has true friends as well
as cowardly lying foes-

  sir william he panted sir
william fraser

  until i spoke i think he had not
been sure who was at his swords
point and with the coming of this
knowledge all hope of victory plainly
left him

  yes said i sir william fraser
who now intends to kill you like any
dog as you would have killed your
master i have wasted too much time
on you already say your prayers
if you can call them to mind

 again he gasped hoarsely he
was facing the windows now the
mopn shining across our swords
gave me the light i needed for
my thrust and i feinted once
twice three times and ran my blade
through his body he cried out
chokingly then flung up his arms
and fell

 wrenching my weapon free i
sprang over to orourke and found
my advent to be a most timely one
he was fighting most brilliantly and
enjoying himself to a quite unreason-
able extent but the two against him
were no pigmies and one of them
had swung round behind him and
was about to plunge a sword into
his back when i interfered there-
after for a time each of us fought
his own man

  the uproar had aroused duke car-
los from the sleep of the just in the
next room and he was now pounding
on our bolted door and clamoring
for an admittance which neither of
us had leisure to give him how-
ever the end was rapidly drawing
near and socn i heard the irishmans
opponent go to the floor with a crash

  let in the duke i called and
as dennis drew back the bolt and
flung the door open i got beneath
my mans guard and brought him
down

a moment later the duke was
standing beside me holding my
hands and peering at me anxiously
while the innkeeper and his wife
hesitated on the threshold she rais-
ing a candle over her head and star-
ing at the litter of bodies he whey-
faced and extremely weak-kneed

  sir william my lord was cry-
the inn of treachery



ing are you wounded where is
signor luigi and in the name of
heaven what does this uproar
mean

now though i had been anything
but idle during the few minutes
my wits had been full as busy as my
sword and i believed i understood
all that had befallen us that night
nor could i resist the temptation
to play the part of the clever man
who unravels the mystery

  signor luigi is there my lord
said i pointing dramatically to
where he lay huddled on the floor
as for the meaning of the occur-
rence it is what i propose to dis-
cover now

  striding suddenly across to the
doorway i halted beside the startled
innkeeper and his wife and keenly
scrutinized their faces in the hope of
discovering which of the pair was
best suited to my purpose

  the woman though pale con-
fronted me with steadiness but the
man was a pitiful sight in his terror
and i promptly addressed myself to
him

  listen to me my friend i said
harshly the gentleman yonder he
in the center of the floor is the duke
of padua ah you did not know
you are astonished that is some-
what strange is it not when you
recognized him on his arrival here
and straightway took yourself off to
inform magnozzi of his coming

  we my lord never as the vir-
gin hears me the woman cried in
a desperate effort to divert my at-
tention

  but i never took my eyes off her
husbands pasty face

  ah you choose to lie do you
i demanded you had better be-
ware if you speak the truth it may
be that the duke will show you
mercy if you do not i swear on
my soul that this is your last hour

on earth and i flashed my bloody
sword close before his eyes

  he flung himself on his knees in
a panic

  pardon pardon my lord he
moaned yes i confess it

  turn your head i commanded
sternly look at that door in the
wall you are accustomed to lodge
those of your guests who carry fat
purses in this room is it not so

  and in the night you enter and
relieve them of their abundance of
this worlds goods eh and mag-
nozzi knew of the trade you ply and
permitted it and in return for his
complaisance taxed you from your
spoils

the man fairly grovelled before
me it is true he shuddered
but how have you guessed this my
lord in the name of the saints
in place of asking questions said
i you had best go thank heaven
for its mercy toward you you know
what magnozzi planned for tonight-
the murder of the duke the killing
of me who guarded him

  but you do not know i fancy
what he planned for tomorrow
fools he would have cried out in
horror he would have haled you to
padua and given you up to justice
as the murderers do you see your
master would have been rid of his
enemy and at no cost to himself
turning from their horrified faces

i	confronted the duke who was still
standing in the center of the room
a good deal more serious than his
wont and obviously as much im-
pressed by my revelations as i could
have desired

  and now my lord said i this
neighborhood is far too near signor
luigis castle to be a healthy
one for us let us go saddle our
horses and ride back to padua as
quickly as we may

the way shattuck slid around
that rock would have done
credit to a fox but even as
he did so he knew that he was trap-
ped there was no other cover near
the rock had concealed him from the
camp hed been stalking when hed
heard those voices from the rear his
quick shift of position meant hed
be seen from below

  the people in these hills had eyes
like hawks-eyes like those of their
ovn hunting eagles

  in any case he was out of rifle
range from the camp that lay about
a mile below in a hidden little val-
ley hed been looking at it for the
past two hours as he slowly ap-
proached it from above in the high
thin air of the mountains the camp
lay microscopic-it had been like
looking at it through the wrong end

of a telescope everything minutely
clear but too microscopic to be
studied

  and he had to study his moves-
did shattuck

  he didnt know where he was
hed almost forgotten that he was a
freeborn american-almost forgot-
ten his name hed been called by so
many different names in so many
different dialects

all he knew was that he was
somewhere in the midriff of asia
-himalaya country-pamirs-hindu
kush that one of those gossamer
billows of blue and white off there
to the north might be the tien shan
-that is the heavenly mountains
as the chinese called them

  in a general way he was headed
for china

  china to shattuck almost meant
american adventurer in the orient

the united states hed passed his
boyhood there-in canton shanghai
tientsin-where his father had lived
and traded

no other countries open to him at
all and perhaps not even
china a man without a country
he had no papers no relatives he
could hardly think of a living soul
who could link him up with his past
-who could actually swear that he
was pel shattuck-pelham rutledge
shattuck-and not some interna-
tional tramp whod merely appro-
priated that name

  like a wild animal caught in his
dangerous position he blended him-
self as best he could with the gravel
and dead grass at the foot of his
rock and there lay completely still

  for a time the voices he had heard
were stilled he might have been

seen or the intruders might have
spied some other game

  from where he lay without other
movement than that of his eyes
shattuck could view the camp-or
the better part of it-through a
crotch of his sheepskin coat no ex-
citement yet

  whatever happened hed have to
go into some camp again pretty soon
anyway

  he wondered where he was-won-
dered who these people were

rphese were some of the questions
that had kept him on the scout
ever since running away from jurras
camp the trouble with junia
camp was that juma had a daughter
a girl named mahree and not even
a man who has got himself in bad
with governments will do certain
things that a girl might propose


thrilling adventures

  khabadar-a voice near-by had
spoken

tt was a word of warning it
hadnt been addressed to himself
but shattuck knew that hed been
discovered

  his mind worked quickly there
was no friction even to thought in
the thin air of these high altitudes
down in the camp just now hed
seen a man staring up in his direc-
tion he could guess the rest the
man had signaled to the hunters on
the mountain   

  it wouldnt do to let them take
him for a wolf or a bear

  shattuck began to whine a bit of
song that hed learned in jumas
camp-just a bar or two-then
stopped short

  as if by accident he thrust his
foxskin cap beyond the edge of the
rock no shot was fired he left
the cap where it was and took a
look from the other side he saw
four men-two of them elderly with
beards and all of them slant-eyed
the quartette were fanned out and
had their rifles ready evidently in
a maneuver to surround him

   let us drink tea shattuck of-
fered in one of the last phrases hed
picked up in jumas camp

  it was an invitation to a parley
an offer to talk-theyd get the pur-
port of it whether they understood
his speech or not he recovered his
cap he stepped from behind his
rock with his own rifle ready

 who are you one of the
bearded elders asked

  his language wasnt like the
kirghiz dialect of jumas people but
it was close enough to it to be un-
derstood

  ameriki shattuck answered

  he smiled and raised his right
hand in salutation hed dropped
his rifle into the crook of his left

arm but hed be able to use it he
guessed if he had to

  the four stared they were a
wild looking lot dressed in sheep-
skin and felt the two elders those
who were bearded had their left
ears pierced and ornamented with
large turquoise earrings none of
them looked as if hed been washed
or had had his hair cut since the day
of his birth

  as for that shattuck felt that
neither had he himself

  the four converged closely as
shattuck approached there was an
air of tenseness about them that
shattuck didnt like they were like
strange dogs closing in on a dog
theyd selected for a kill

  in an instant shattuck had swung
his rifle back to ready again and had
them covered-ready to fire from the
hip

  the movement was so swift that
they were caught unprepared he
gave them a quick survey then ad-
dressed the elder who carried the
best weapon-that alone was enough
to indicate he stood higher than
these others

  let the guns fall he ordered
quickly then maybe we shall
talk like friends

ii

there is a sort of universal
language more of looks than
of words or gestures-the
sort of communication that had al-
ready thrown shattuck on his guard
in the same way he could grasp the
thought of these four now as they
let their weapons fall

  here is a mad fool well get
him later

  shattuck pushed the four guns
into a pile with his foot one was
a modern sporting rifle-english he
surmised the others looked like
copies of older models-clumsy imi-
captain trouble



tations but effective enough such a
might have been made in lhassa or
kabul

  even with his eyes down he sur-
prised a movement from one of the
younger men

  the emergency was so sharp that
shattuck spoke up in english

  do you want to die

  the young man had started to sig-
nal the camp in the valley hed
done so already perhaps with their
telescopic eyes most of these hill-
men could flash signals or read them
across amazing distances

  there was a lull then the leader
of the four spoke up

 huzoor-

that was vernacular an address
of respect but the rest of it was
coming in english-as slowly as
creakingly as a door forced open on
rusty hinges but english

 excellence we mean you no
harm and i take it that you mean
us no harm

 who are you

  your servant tsarong

  the humility was too great to be
sincere shattuck looked the old man
in the eye the gaze that met his
was veiled and shrewd

  who are your people

  just a few poor changpas
changpas people from the chan-
tang

 as the meaning of this simple
statement flashed into shattucka
mind it was all that he could do to
suppress a start even so he di-
vined an answering start in the eyes
of the old man

  the changpas were tibetans-the
people of the tang the desert plains
of tibets far west it was an af-
fair of tibet and russia that had
got shattuck into trouble with the
cheka the soviet secret service
shattuck smiled pleasantly

  sit down father tsarong he in-
vited and tell your friends to sit
down thus you four sit down
with your backs to the camp and ill
sit here in front of you like that
should you see any other of your
people coming from behind me you
can signal them not to shoot-as they
might miss and shoot you instead
old man tsarong hesitated

  we are unworthy of that honor
he said only our lord the gen-
eral is worthy such an honor
what you say is perfectly true
shattuck replied send for him
send for him he is the gov-
ernor of the entire chantang
father do as i say tell him
youve met an earth demon who
knows everything i know all about
those russian arms youve come to
this valley to get dorje-pamo the
pig-faced goddess told me about
them herself

  the old man was stricken

 he mumbled an order and the
three others-including the other
elder himself-were for setting off
together but shattuck stopped the
rush only one was to go and he
was to be the best runner among
them

  as the runner started off down the
mountainside shattuck could see
that there was already some alarm
in the camp a string of yaks
horses sheep and goats had begun to
straggle in from behind a shoulder
of the hill driven by women and
children

  are you not then english
tsarong asked

  ameriki shattuck replied

he could see that the word meant
nothing to the tibetans to
them all white foreigners were eng-
lish-that or possibly oross rus-
sian

  the three tibetans sat in front of


thrilling adventures

him and below him at a respectful
distance facing him their backs to
the camp shattuck also had folded
his legs and seated himself on the
ground the four surrendered rifles
piled in front of him and his own
weapon across his knees

 the queer thought came to him
that he was no longer an outcast
and a man without a country after
all he was now as a king seated
on a throne the throne was a
mountain he had an arsenal he
had subjects who looked at him with
awe speculating like other subjects
on the divinity of kings

 there was something about the
vast panorama that surrounded him
that stimulated this thought-stimu-
lated it to the point of sheer crazi-
ness yet hereabouts there were
still legends of alexander the great
of ghengis khan and kubla khan
and tamerlane

  there was a persistent legend that
from this part of the world would
come the next great king of the
world

  the three tibetans were watching
him he was watching them

  i am pelham rutledge shattuck
he announced slowly

  he was making the announcement
for himself as much as he was for
them it sounded strange to hear
his own name spoken like that even
by his own voice here in this him-
alayan space it was like some sort
of a mantram-a spell the name
went vibrating off into the blue of
central asia

  the tibetans looked puzzled even
old tsarong

  shattuck get that

  there was a respectful murmur

  repeat it shattuck told them
shattuck

  they tried it-first tsarong the
linguist then the others they also
seemed to think that it was some
sort of a spell

  sha-dak sha-dak sha-dak

  it might have been a spell at that
as they pronounced it the name
became a chinese word meaning
trouble shadak

  they were repeating it with hon-
orary titles added

  shadak-la

  shadak-beg

  shadak-khan

 my god shattuck muttered
thats who i am all right

  in the silence of his thought it
was as if an echo of silent thunder
had come rolling back upon him out
of space calling him by a name to
which he was fated

  captain trouble

ill

it may have been what some
would have called just a coin-
cidence but as that new name of
his vibrated in shattucks thought
with a queer sensation of something
magical about it a din broke out in
the camp below

  shadak

  it sounded like trouble it was a
din of horns and gongs drums a
shouting the whole camp it seemed
dogs included had begun to turn
out with its full capacity of noise

  shattuck never winced hed be-
come used to a lot of things since
his escape from the cheka in sa-
markand hed become used to a
lot of things before that

  hed gone to russia as a mining
expert-especially as one who spoke
chinese-expecting to be sent to
manchuria instead of that through
some error perhaps hed found him-
self switched to bokhara the error
it turned out was that hed been
falsely accused of pro-japanese ac-
tivities it was true that hed lived
in japan for a while

 in samarkand hed broken open
some boxes which should have con-
captain trouble



tained some overdue mining ma-
chinery the machinery turned out
to be machine-guns instead and des-
tined for chantang

  suddenly it had become desirable
that he leave the country he was
in the chekas black list hed al-
ways wanted anyway to see af-
ghanistan  and the devil was there in
the person of a former afghan
wazir michmander by name to
speed him on his way

  michmander knew of certain lost
mines in the hindu-kush it was
knowledge that had to be kept of
course from the thieving govern-
ment at kabul the afghan capital

  shattuck was willing

he stuck to michmander in a trek
that took them into mountains
not marked-except vaguely and in-
correctly-on any map and theyd
had a small army of cutthroats and
all-round soldiers of fortune with
them before they were through-
shattuck himself the only white man
in the lot

  theyd penetrated to the depths
of that great upheaval known as
the purdah lady-k--a moun-
tain as veiled and as hard to get to
that is as a lady shut up in a harem

  and there theyd had a battle with
wild natives who were armed with
spears and long-handled hatchets

  it was a great battle

  shattuck had seen almost all of it
and he must have done his share
for the last thing that michmander
-he who had led him into this mess
-ever said to him was to call him a
fighting fool

 michmander-having been exiled
from afghanistan long ago-had
passed enough time in america to
have picked up some american
slang

  he was laughing as he said it in
the thick of the fight and trying to

reload his automatic-a difficult job
because hed lost a couple of fingers
and shattuck himself was swaying
on his feet and covered with blood

  you fighting fool

  one of the few supreme compli-
ments ever paid to any man for
just as michmander said it a long
handled hatchet came swishing down
and split michmanders head like a
melon

  how the fight ended shattuck
didnt clearly know anyway there
were parts of it that he was willing
to forget

  but he had a vague idea that hed
lived for a while in a cave where
long ranks of stone gods a hundred
feet high looked down on small
brown men bearing saucerlike lamps

  after that there followed months
-it might have been years so far as
he knew then-of wandering always
wandering and always amid moun-
tains

  when he emerged from this daze
or trance it was to find hed been
adopted by juma the kirghiz chief
who was almost blind he cured
jumas blindness by simple cleanli-
ness and an application of boracic
acid hed worked up the wash him-
self from borax hed found in the
bed of a dry lake

tn the meantime hed found out
j- that he had been barred from
india the government of india was
taking no chances with tramps whod
messed things up in both russia and
afghanistan yet he might have told
those folks at delhi about those
boxed machine-guns had they let him
in

  or again he might have stayed on
with juma he liked the old man
and juma had given him a rifle and
ammunition considerably more valu-
able than their weight in gold

  but the girl mahree-fifteen slen-


thrilling adventures

der full-breasted with eyes like a
fawns-had broken an apricot in two
and offered him half

the din from the camp had as-
sumed something like order and
processional movement swelling
louder coming nearer-horns and
gongs clanging cymbals that tumult
of shouting the voices of women
and children split through all this
now and then with a shrill like that
of fifes

  there were shattuck judged
three or four hundred persons in the
mob most of the noise seemed to
come from a solid phalanx of men in
the center it wasnt long before he
could see that these men were rough-
ly uniformed in long red robes at
first he thought that these men were
masked but in a little while he
could see that what hed taken to be
masks were simply their own black-
ened faces

  somewhere hed read about those
blackened faces-the fighting monks
of the tibetan lamaseries even
their name popped up he repeated
it

  dok-dokpa

  he kept his air of unconcern but
he decided that at the first show of
battle hed seize old father tsarong
over there and hold him as both
shield and hostage

  they have heard said tsarong
what your presence has said about
dorje-pamo they wish to honor
the messenger of the pig-faced
goddess

  it was simply stated but it sound-
ed like irony to shattuck he had
an idea that old tsarong was not so
simple as he would have it appear
nor could tsarong have been so un-
important either the other elder
had placed himself slightly back of
tsarong the beardless one was
frankly remote

  stand up and face them tsarong
la said shattuck

  your presence-

  stand up and face them signal
them to remain where they are

  there was something besides blood
that had begun to beat through shat-
tucks arteries it was always that
way when a fight threatened-espe-
cially if it was apt to be a fight
against overwhelming odds it was
a sort of lulling warmth it was as
sweet as a bugle call to a cavalry
horse it was a premonition

  as tsarong still hesitated-pre-
tending not to hear-pretending not
to understand-shattuck saw a glint
of something in the old mans eyes
that confirmed the premonition in his
veins

from where he sat shattuck
jumped

  it was a trick that jumas young
fighting bucks had taught him
theyd be sitting crosslegged on the
ground-they might have been sit-
ting like that for hours and then-
presto-they could fling themselves
to right or left or forward or back-
ward as if their leg had been
springs

  as shattuck sprung it was exactly
as if a fragment of that swelling din
from down the hillside had detached
itself and had almost fallen upon
him

  he came down crouching at the
side of old tsarong as he did so
he whirled and fired without taking
aim an instant afterward-and al-
ways afterward-it seemed to him
that he must have seen what was
coming up behind him with some
sort of eyes different from those in
the front of his head

  hed as if seen that enemy sneak-
ing upon him from behind

  felt boots red cloak black face-
it was a giant of a man and hed
been on the point of cutting down
captain trouble



on him with one of the biggest
swords that shattuck had ever seen

  the bullet from shattucks rifle
had taken the giant through the
shoulder he was twisted back and
around like a big tree hit near the
top by lightning the sword got a
jerk that sent it spiralling like a
boomerang for a good twenty yards

  you next grunted shattuck

  and even while this was happen-
ing he had caught an arm about the
old man tsarongs shoulders

  to tsarong it must have been like
an embrace from death

 shadak-shadak khan tsarong
squeaked

  in the confusion of the moment
the pronouncing of that name reached
shattuck like a happy portent-a
sure enough mantram

  he was aware that tsarong wasnt
the only one whod pronounced that
name so had that other elder-also
perhaps the beardless boy the fact
that they had joined in the cry-
some intonation of horror and plead-
ing in their voices-gave shattuck
an idea

  ai-ya he laughed you thought
to fool me old man tsarong why
youre the governor yourself

iv

  a ll this had taken place in full

 uk view of that mob of dokpas
x and civilians coming up
from the camp theyd been coming
pretty fast thered been a crescendo
to their racket culminating in a
shriek and clang that was like the
explosion of a high-powered shell

 the goliath of the sword was
staggering around in a narrowing
circle like a dog looking for a place
to lie down down he went-coiled
then straightened out he was sum-
moning all that vast strength of his
to become a man again-become the

hero he must have felt himself when
hed swung up that big sword of his
to kill an earth demon no less and
his whole tribe looking on

  it was a swift impression that
shattuck got-but detailed one apt
to be lasting that big face of his
shining with grease and blacking
contorted with terror more than
pain was nothing human

then shattuck saw that the big
man had been merely the first of
several there must have been a
dozen swordsmen headed in his di-
rection

  in one respect at any rate his
strategy had been correct there
wasnt a single gun in sight tsarong
must have seen to that unwilling
to take a chance on any dokpa marks-
manship hed given his order accord-
ingly when hed sent his runner back
to the camp

  shattuck still embracing tsarong
gave an order

  tell your swordsmen to retire-

  the old man panted but did not
speak

  -else ill kill you before their
eyes

  the victory is gods tsarong
panted - slowly fatalistically - in
english he raised his voice and
shrilled something in tibetan

  just an affair of seconds all this
was - seconds that galloped like
horses in a race but each horse of a
second mounted by some watchful
jockey that recorded every move

  you havent answered me tsarong
la said shattuck softly

  wherefore o shadak khan when
you know all things

  its you the governor of chan-
tang

  i am but half the governor as
you see o shadak khan the other
half is he who sat beside me each
district has two governors


thrilling adventures

  shattuck eyed the other bearded
and earringed elder hed been sit-
ting there in a white trance

  and whats your name shattuck
asked

  the old man merely gasped like a
carp out of water he wanted to
answer something but he was afraid
he hadnt understood

  dont you understand even the
language of heaven shattuck asked
in his best chinese

  kuan-hua

  the stricken elder recovered him-
self in a gulp of amazement that
made him forget his fears

  the mandarin dialect was what
he meant

  my lord speaks even the language
of the sons of heaven

 i am indeed your lord old
uncle shattuck told him rapidly in
chinese and make no mistake i
have proved it i am a spirit merely
disguised as a hairy face which
is the superior of you twain

 my brother tsarong is the
elder

  doesnt he speak the kuan-hua

  inadequately while i went east
he went west

rjlell moon face here said
shattuck to go get such help as
is needed to carry away this crippled
dokpa he is to be cared for kindly

  moon face was sped on his way

  and before he returns shattuck
hurried on ill tell you that both
of you old men are deserving death
but see instead of that here while
all your people are looking on i em-
brace you both to him who went
west i speak the language of the
west to him that went east i
speak the language of the east who
then am i

  verily you are shadak khan

 i am shadak khan i am cap-
tain trouble have you not heard

-hasnt the dalai lama himself
heard-that a new king is coming
into the world i am he ive come
to rule the world for a while my
name is-shadak khan my name is
-captain trouble

  something of this talk must have
reached the crowd down the hill it
may have done this partly through
that curious intuition of crowds-
especially of crowds already incan-
descent and annealed by excitement
moon face the messenger may have
spread something of it as he went
down seeking help for the wounded
man

a dozen lamas not of the fight-
ing sort but regular ge-longs-
the superior sort whod had brains
enough to pass their examinations
and showing it in their faces-had
responded to the call the appear-
ance of them gave shattuck another
idea

 and is there not one among
these he asked who speaks either
the language of the chiling-ky-me
-hed put the question in english
but hed used the only tibetan word
he knew it made a pretty flourish

  chiling-ky-me

  old juma had taught him that
word for juma had conducted
robber raids off and on into pretty
nearly every section of the high
country even into tibet the word
meant foreigners-that is the eng-
lish

  before old tsarong could pull him-
self together to answer shattuck it
was anothers voice who answered in
english

  sir my-father-

  shattuck just at the sound of that
voice felt a tingling thrill he didnt
know why he didnt have time to
ask hed raised his eyes and had
een the speaker-a lean face and a
shaven head that might have be-
longed to some young roman gen
captain trouble



eral even his tattered robe of a
tibetan lama might have been a
toga

 the voice was forcing a calm that
 the brilliant eyes belied

sir my - father - was - ameri-
can

v

 it was shattucks turn to exert all
 his will at self-control the other
 lamas were staring so were
 the two old governors shattuck
 could feel that they were but he
 kept his eyes on that soberly flash-
 ing face of the young lama whod
 spoken

 brother he said what is your
 name

my tibetan name is champela

you have another

there was a long pause

john day

 it had been his fathers name this
 young lama explained his father
 had been a geologist whod married
 his own lalla rookh in the vale of
 cashmere theyd both been killed
 by an avalanche in that gorge called
 by the tibetans the four devil
 pass

it was also champela himself who
referred to his mother as lalla
rookh hed read the poem as a
boy

 so did i said shattuck

to shattuck after his months of
exile it was as if hed stumbled on-
to a lamasery here in the heart of
asia floating the american flag

 while the other lamas carried the
 wounded black-face away shattuck
 deserted the two old governors and
 drew champela aside

john day he said are you
free

 champela reflected

as free as you are shadak
khan he replied

shattuck let the title ride thered

been no hint of mockery in it if
anything thered been something
just the opposite it was as if the
title had been confirmed by a
prophet

  youre not held by any vows
none but those i have made to
myself

  no chief lama is your master
not even the dalai lama himself
shadak khan

  why dont you call me by my
right name john day

  i believe that i am calling you by
your right name shadak khan
your coming has been predicted
since a thousand years-since twice
a thousand years-

  you mean

  a scourge of god perhaps-a
shadak khan-a captain trouble
he has a thousand names but so
has the sun so has maitreya-he
who will come-

  they were standing there on the
high slope of what has been called
the roof of the world the sun
was going down and with one of
those sudden transformations of light
so common in mountain country the
snow peaks had turned to flaming
gold

  you be my prime minister john
day said shattuck

  hed still intended his proposal
even then to sound something like
a joke but it didnt sound like a
joke at all it was as if the very
mountains were celebrating the event
this was something that had been
predicted since twice a thousand
years

  ill be your prime minister
champela told him

  shake

the young lama might not have
caught the meaning of the word
in that particular sense but he was
quick enough to understand the ex-
tended hand


thrilling adventures

  now im not free he said

  neither am i

  no man is free from his destiny
-and this our meeting also was
predestined-perhaps since the begin-
ning of the world

  there was a barbecue in the little
valley of the camp that night
though not in the american style
the tibetans like to eat their meat
boiled-or raw washed down with
gallons of tea and rancid butter or
chang the beer of the country and
arrak a whisky distilled from the
beer

  the dung fires seethed and spit blue
flames

  there was singing dancing and
fights before it was fairly dark

  the people were celebrating the
advent of shadak khan they
werent quite sure yet just what this
signified but it had something to
do with dorje-pamo the pig-faced
goddess they knew that much
and that was enough the way to
please old dorje-pamo was to gorge
and souse brawl and make love   

  but john day prime minister of
shadak khan wouldnt let shattuck
partake of the feast-not even as a
guest of the governors

  theyll fill you with aconite he
said youd be dead before dawn

  most tibetans were ardent poison-
ers in times of great emergency

  there was an early moon in its
ghostly light a cavalcade of ponies
left the scene of the camp and wound
its way further up the valley

  shattuck was in the midst of it
in the place of greatest safety and
honor those in front and those
following so far as he could see
were white lamas like champela

in the moonlight it was hard to
think of champela as john day
american for that matter shattuck
found it hard to think of himself as
himself he was something else-

something bigger than himself-
something predestined since the be-
ginning of the world

 shadak khan

  captain trouble

vi

by the light of this same moon
a caravan of more than three
hundred camels came padding
back into this same secret valley
from the outlying desert unknown
to shattuck it was this caravan for
which the warring tibetans had
been waiting

  the camel-bells made music in the
night it was a rhythmic music
to which the swishing feet of the
stock kept time like the feet of tire-
less dancers it would have been
hard to find a better equipped or a
better conducted caravan anywhere

 every man was armed even the
camel-pullers were armed

  any old caravan man would have
spotted the sort of caravan this was
without looking twice

  tu fang-tze

  opium-runners caravans like this
brought the precious white opium
of persia through the gobi to all
points east but even an old gobi man
might have been puzzled by the loads
and the haste of this present caravan
if not by the trails it followed

  no opium-train ever followed the
regular roads anyway

  but these camels were carrying
full loads-compact and strongly
boxed arms that would be sure
but the trail could lead nowhere ex-
cept back into the wild and thinly
populated chantang country of ti-
bets far west

  along a smooth bit of going the
owner of the outfit mounted on
a nimble black pony drew alongside
of his caravan-master who was rid-
ing half asleep and half awake on
the pick of the camels the relations
captain trouble



 of owner and master were about like
 those of owner and captain on a
 ship at sea

 they were speaking mongolian a
 language that had been largely de-
 veloped in desert places their
 voices were no louder than the oc-
 casional bubbling of the camel the
 caravan-master rode

 well soon arrive at the turn-off
 of the thorny well trail big man
 the owner of the outfit said

 what of it duke

 it is a short way and a safe
 way

 to where were going

 no big man to kansu

 were not going to kansu duke
 were going to the lesser valley of
 the soaring meditation

 i cant help thinking about how
 much more money these arms would
 bring in china than they would in
 tibet

 the caravan-master yawned and
 belched

 big man i mean it

 mean what

 the difference in price would en-
 rich us both general hokwa is in
 kansu with all the gold he collected
 during his last campaign

 may it give him inflammation of
 the bowels

 but kansu needs these machine-
 guns tibet doesnt

 search me groaned big man or
 words to that effect

 he dropped his head on his chest
 and pretended to be sleeping
 again the owner of the outfit still
 ambled on at his side

 big man he said when theyve
 got you back there in the hills how
 do you know that those louse-breed-
 ing tibetans are going to pay you
 i dont know it

 what then

 theyll pay first or they dont get
 the arms

  they may take them anyway
from this bunch dont make me
laugh this bunch i havent got
a man in my string who hasnt been
slitting throats for the past ten
years were a bunch of fighting
wildcats

vii

well need a fighting-man
like you said the old ab-
bot as shattuck stood be-
fore him

  john day translated the tibetan
into perfect english

  they are bringing fighting-ma-
chines into the little valley the
abbot went on in a whispering mono-
tone and they that bring the ma-
chines are fighting men

  the abbot was very old his eyes
were so glazed that they appeared to
be sightless he seemed to be talk-
ing in his sleep about things that he
saw in his sleep

  he sat cross-legged on a cushioned
bench back of a carved teakwood
table on the table were a covered
teacup and a bell the table was
like an altar when the abbot was
silent he sat so still it was easy to
imagine that he was an image in a
temple

  he was silent for a long time
then he spoke again

  the spirit of revolution has en-
tered tibet there are foolish men
planning to put a king in the place
of the dalai lama

  john day translated he saw that
shattuck was about to ask a ques-
tion but he raised a warning hand

  it was as if the movement had
struck a spark of life from the image
presented by the abbot what he
said was

  i will answer your question cap-
tain trouble

  and shattuck knew then beyond
all doubt-as hed already been


thrilling adventures

prepared to believe-that he was in
the presence of an authentic bogdo
-a living buddha although the
old seer continued to speak in tibe-
tan it was as if a skillful painter
were now casting up a picture on
some invisible canvas of the air

 along toward the next peak-
shining time-and shattuck could
see the light of the rising sun along
a mountain-crest while it was still
night in the valleys

  -they will arrive at the narrow
place of this valley of ours called
the jaws of the wolf

 shattuck would recognize that
narrow gorge when he saw it-he
would recognize it from what he was
seeing now

several times the bogdo seemed
to be on the point of speech again
and each time that he did so shat-
tuck caught some fleeting vision in
which the movement and the figures
were confused by a red mist each
time when the red mist was shaping
itself into something definite the
bogdo made an erasing gesture in
front of him with his slender hand
and the unformed picture disap-
peared

  finally he murmured two words
which john day translated

  acquire merit

 the bogdo reached out and
touched his teacup as if he were
about to drink it was a ceremonial
gesture meaning that the audience
was ended   

  the soaring meditation lamasery
of the lesser valley-as the place
was known-was like a series of set-
back houses against a steep moun-
tain slope as shattuck and his new
prime minister came out on an up-
per terrace they both could tell by
the stars that the night was already
far gone

  it is time that i hit the road
said shattuck

  pel-captain-

   make it pel

   im going with you

youre not im captain trou-
ble im even the fighting fool
i saw a blood-red mist when the
bogdo talked youre not a man of
blood

   the camp is debauched and drunk
 youll have no one to help you
 so much the better

  you cant go alone these are
 gun-runners-all fighting men

   his holiness the bogdo saw me
 fighting them there alone so did i
 thats why he mentioned that place
 where one man can turn them back
 is there a horse in the stables with
 a chestnut coat and a white mane
 torang the abbots own if he
 showed him to you in the vision he
 meant you to have him

  for an interval john day closed
 his eyes during that interval he
 had become champela the mystic
 desciple of buddha again he opened
 his eyes with a changed expression

  i have just received a message
 myself from the bogdo he said
 what about

   im not sure myself follow me
 they went down a dozen flights of
 steps as narrow and as steep as lad-
 ders most of the time they were in
  almost complete darkness only
 here and there a butter-lamp burned

  they came into a dusky temple
 room and there without hesitation
 champela again the mystic went
 over to where a monumental statue
 of buddha reared its height and
 breadth into the shadows from a
 breast-high platform the front of
 this platform champela raised like
 the lid of a coffer into this recep-
 tacle he stood gazing for a few sec-
 onds with a rapt attention

  then he drew out a long object
 swathed in fold after fold of silk
captain trouble



what is it shattuck whispered

  the young lama also whispered
but his voice was thrilling

  something else the bogdo is send-
ing you-the sword of kubla khan

viii

w t t hen chief juma awoke to
 the fact that his adopted

   t son dak the nearest hed
ever got to shattuck had put the
wind between them he was very dis-
consolate

  like many another hillman nature
had been generous to him in the
matter of height he was all of six
feet seven in his well-worn chap-
lies the sandals he stuck to in win-
ter as in summer and physically he
was as tough as a bundle of rattan
but he was at an age when he was
prone to go over and over the same
story time and again

  and now that dak was gone he
was worse than ever in this respect
formerly hed had a number of fa-
vorite stories-how hed killed this
or that blood enemy how hed robbed
whole caravans single-handed

  but now he could think of only
that one story

 hed come on this crazy young
sahib shattuck back in the hills
being more or less neglected by some
roaming kazaks after all even
kazaks may treat a crazy man no
worse than a dog and he was about
to pass up the incident when by
mere chance he learned from a rene-
gade afghan the sort of battle the
lad had put up against great odds
while trying to raid a government
gold mine

  thereupon in the hope of merit
in heaven and also perhaps a few
honest rupees from the sahibs to
whom this lad evidently belonged
hed sought to turn dak over to
the english but the cow-eaters
wouldnt have him at any price

  hed done something that had
made him skip out of the country of
the oross the english had said
then hed got into this battle in
kafiristan

  after that juma wouldnt have
parted with the boy anyway-not at
any price hed nurtured the lad
like his own child hed spent a
years income on prayers and medi-
cines for him as a result the boy
came out of his dream and having
come out of his dream hed put the
healing touch on jumas own eye-
trouble

juma couldnt understand i t
theyd loved each other like
father and son why had dak put
the wind between them

  and so it went on and on day af-
ter day until the mother of the
girl mahree came and told juma the
tale shed learned from mahree her-
self

  now by allah and all the fiends
of gehenna said juma had dak
but whispered it to me id given him
the girl as readily as i would have
given him anything else i won
didnt he restore my sight

  after that he kept his band on
the move he was looking for
dak over high passes and into
valleys hed almost forgotten into
villages where there were unsettled
blood-claims against him into for-
bidden temples and lamaseries-
there was no place where juma
wouldnt go in the pursuit of that
strange search of his

  to make matters worse mahree
was getting older also she was
gaining in beauty hed never gone
in for purdah nonsense he was able
to take care of his women but hed
have to wrap the girl up in a
burgua at that if he wanted to keep
her for dak he was getting
higher and higher offers for her all
the time


thrilling adventures

 then one day juma came on a
fakir sitting naked on a glacier
and the devout neighbors assured
juma that the holy man had sat like
that unmoving since the last new
moon that meant the fakir had
suffered killing frost for more than
ten days yet he showed not the
slightest ill affects from it the man
was holy

  when juma went to see him the
holy man came out of his period
of meditation and said

 he whom you call your son is
near death

  juma said sick

  no in bloody battle

  praise god at least for that
said juma where

  i see-wait-a lamasery in a lit-
tle valley-a cleft between two hills
-and there thy son is as one against
a hundred-

 the sadhu stopped as if hed
never spoken at all

 where screamed juma or
ill tear you-

  the sadhu looked up at him un-
moved and juma for the first time
in his life began to quaver

 where o holy one sec i am
getting old

  the holy one looked at him with
compassion he made a forward
movement with his hand to indicate
a direction

 that way-until the sun goes
down

juma turned and strode away as
he stood he didnt have his gun
he hadnt dared carry it into the
presence of the holy one as hed
wanted to be sure of having his
questions answered but he had his
knife and the hills were rich in
rocks of throwing and hammering
size

  hed covered a mile before he dis-
covered that he was followed it

was that curst of a female the cause
of it all the girl mahree

  he tried to drive her back

  but to his amazement and her own
she defied him

  since when she shrilled is a
woman forbidden to fight for her
man

ix

with torang between his
knees and the sword of
kubla khan held close to
his breast shadak khan captain
trouble the fighting fool was off
to fight he didnt know exactly what

  long ago he had known someone
called pelham-rutledge-shattuck
the name kept time to torangs
swift but easy lope pelham-rut-
ledge-shattuck-

  but it wasnt he-it wasnt he-
whod sat on a mountain throne
and looked into the eyes of his sub-
jects it wasnt he whod stood in
the presence of a reincarnated bud-
dha and heard his fortune told it
wasnt he who rode an abbots horse
down a long dark valley with the
sword of a great war-lord against
his breast

  no those were pages from the life
of shadak khan-captain trouble
-fighting fool-

  there came to the reincarnation
who was himself the sharp pang of
a realizing thought the thought
was this-that he might be riding to
his death he remembered the red
mist-the half-seen astral pictures
that the bogdo had wiped away with
his slender white hand the old mans
final words

  acquire merit

  how if death was the way hed
take his chance

  he looked up just in time to see
a meteor slide across the sky it
wouldnt be so bad to go like that
captain trouble



  he felt a sense of elation it was
as if the sword against his breast
were coming to life-taking on a
warmth of its own it had no scab-
bard the blade was a long strong
scimitar yet so exquisitely balanced
to the hilt it could be handled like
a wand

  he flashed it about his head it
sang

  to that faint note torang let out
a link or two of speed in this
light the geldings dark body was in-
visible his white mane and tail
glinted along like a pair of de-
tached specters

  it was this dash of white in the
dark that had given the horse his
name torang-the first glint of
daybreak a high cloud shining
white while the earth was dark

  there was a cloud like that hang-
ing over the easterly summits when
shattuck passed the camp where last
night the two old governors would
have given him aconite he spat in
their direction

it was a gesture as much for all
their gorging guzzling lecherous
herd of human swine as it was for
them and these were the men
whod barter for a revolution

  before you could revolute a land
you had to revolute yourself

  so said the heir to the blade of
kubla khan

  the thought was still with him
when the valley suddenly twisted
and went into a corridor like that
of some overwhelming ruin he was
at the very lips of the wolfs open
jaws

  he didnt know how to pray but
some instinct was telling him that
the moment was solemn and that he
ought to do something

  he reined in torang with a swift
hand he raised the sword of the
great khan kubla straight up above
his head his head went down for

a moment he was thinking of the
strange john day

  i sure would be glad to be good
enough he whispered to have him
not as a prime minister-youre
crazy-but merely as a friend

  a moment later he was stirred
from his reverie by some faint spasm
of nervous excitement that ran
through torangs lithe frame it
was like a faint current of electrici-
ty a silent telephone call torang
had arched his neck his slender
ears were focusing on a distant sound

  a moment later shattuck was hear-
ing the sound himself-the faint
far-off clink and clank of camel
bells

x

the gorge of the wolf-
literally the throat-ran be-
tween towering cliffs for a
twisted mile and pretty bad going
all the way after the primordial
earthquake had riven the mountains
apart a stream-or recurrent streams
-had scoured out the bottom leav-
ing a debris of footless boulders
causing -a cave-in here and a dike
there and a pit like an elephant trap
somewhere else

  the caravan-master knew all this
he had been through the gorge time
and again before it used to be part
of the regular opium route until the
old bogdo of the soaring meditation
lamasery put an end to it

  the bogdo was known to have
great powers otherwise he would
have taken the aconite a long time
ago there had often been talk
among the caravan-master and his
band that they could raid the lam-
asery and make their fortunes at it

  the place was isolated there
wasnt a drunken brawling dok-
dokpa about the place-not a fighting
man of any kind and it was gen-
erally known that into the mountain


thrilling adventures

back of every monastery the treasure
caves were being dug deeper and
deeper every year that sort of
thing had been going on for centu-
ries the treasure of even a run-
down old lamasery like that of the
soaring meditation would be enough
to buy japan

  but theyd never tried to make a
raid they didnt dare the bogdo
had a reputation of being in league
with certain ghosts

  it was that matter of ghosts as
much as the uncertain footing of the
gorge that had caused the caravan-
master-a pastmaster in timing like
all good smugglers-to bring his
weary train to the outer mouth of
the gorge just at the peak-shining
hour

  no more ghosts after peak-shining
and there would be light enough
although night got clogged in the
narrow defile and stuck there like a
fcg until late morning

  he didnt dare halt now even for
a minute camels were peculiar
creatures you could keep them go-
ing and going-as he had this time-

  kwa-chi-cheng

one forced march on top of an-
other but let up on them af-
ter a race like that and the beasts
would flop down and die in their
tracks besides inside the valley
there were good grazing and water
outside there was none

  still in the lead and only half
awake the caravan-master pushed on
into the gorge hed scarcely en-
tered it before there was a clattering
of hoofs and he saw a lone horse-
man in the shadows ahead

  from the moment the caravan-
master saw this man he felt the ap-
proach of trouble-a dark horse with
a white mane and tail then to a
sharp increase of his trouble he saw
that the man in front of him was un-
questionably white

 the man came ambling toward
him at a good swift track and didnt
stop or speak until the caravan-mas-
ters own camel stopped

  i know you said the man on the
horse his chinese was that of
pechili with a good snap to it
youre wong tajen it was as if
to say wong the big man

  wong was beginning to simmer

  this is no place to halt my cara-
van he said

  he guessed the fellow might be
a russian hed heard about big
fights between opposing clans of the
oross beyond the gobi

  im halting it big man

 who are you

  dont talk to me from a camel
dismount

  big mans ears wert picking up
tell-tale sounds from back of him as
squad after squad of camels came to
a halt

 dismount and send your camel
ahead or all the camels will be lying
down on you you know that fat-
head

 wong did know it hed been
handling camels for the better part
of thirty years but not for twenty
years had anyone dared call him
ta-tou fathead except a fresh tax-
collector whom later hed slowly
killed

with a curse and grunt he rolled
himself from the riding camel
he was on the beast was already
smelling grass and water and lurched
ahead the camel that followed
also lurched as it did so some-
thing amazing happened it shed its
load-one heavy box to either side

  a sword had flashed across the
pack rope-a mere swish and the
rope had parted

  even while wong was rolling from
his camel hed found the grip of the
revolver he carried in the breast of
his sheepskin coat he got that far
captain trouble



when he stopped to think this man
might have an army back of him
already two camels were past-his
favorite of all the camels hed ever
slept on leading the way

  the thought meant hesitation the
hesitation lost him his chance and
two other camels two other loads
had crashed down

  hands up and face the rock you
-this fellow spoke like no russian

  there was a needle of steel against
wongs neck

  wongs nerves were tuned to small
things in that needlepoint against
his neck he could detect not the
slightest quaver-no skipping no
torture

  his hands were up his face was
to the rock

  there were shocks of falling boxes
the grunt and scramble and heave of
camels becoming frenzied by a pros-
pect of camel heaven after a long
hard drag through camel hell

  and the fellow kept talking all the
time-slanging the camel pullers and
laughing at them he was driving
them back along the gorge as fast as
he slit the lashings of the heavy
freight hey you big man why
dont you ask me who i am

  who-and wong dared to turn

  hands still up or ill slit your
throat as you did the widows in the
traveling sands

that was the most secret murder
that wong had ever done his
eyes were beginning to pop the
man leaned down from his horse-
torang wasnt very tall-and found
with his left hand the pistol in
wongs breast wong felt a faint
breath of courage when the white
devil searched no further-else hed
found a second pistol lower down

  who are you duke wong asked
placatingly

  not duke kahn he stopped

to sever the ropes on two more
camels and wong had snatched his
second pistol higher shadak kahn
-all same captain trouble you
savvy captain trouble

  shadak khan turned to yell at a
camel puller who was trying to stop
a camel by the nose-rope the camel-
puller was either stupid or deaf he
raised apologetic frightened eyes to
the horse-riding duke and pulled
harder than ever

  at that instant there was a crash-
ing report-it sounded like a hand-
grenade there in the rocky confines
of the gorge

  shattuck felt a blaze of heat at his
side as if his coat had caught on
fire but before hed take note of
this-more swiftly than wong the
big man could fire his number two
gun a second time-shattuck lunged
like a thing alive and self-directed
the sword of kubla khan slit the
big mans throat

tibetans are early risers
their climate has made them
so late night and morning
hold about the only golden hours
they ever know along about mid-
day the horrible wind comes up-the
buran the hideous dry gale that
blows stronger and stronger under a
blanched and cloudless sky

  as often as not the people of tibet
will be up and about well before
daylight even after a night of de-
bauch

  it was so this morning in the lit-
tle valley in the camp of the two
old governors tsarong and his
brother then the black-faced fight-
ing lamas where thirsty and on the
prowl for fresh adventure so early-
or so late-that there had practically
been no night for them at all and
the dokpas were the first to note that
queer invasion of camels from the


thrilling adventures

throat of the wolf they were a
superstitious lot those dokpas-none
more so since to each of them had
come some time or other manifesta-
tions of powers they could not un-
derstand

  these blubbering crazed and
naked camels rocking into the valley
like so many camel ghosts and some-
thing really terrifying about them

  the governors were roused

  in an incredibly short time the
whole camp was up and active
these were livestock people-more
used to yaks than camels but recog-
nizing in this stampeded herd more
value than a century of goats would
ever bring

old tsarong wasnt long in put-
ting two and two together

  this was the munition train theyd
come to meet something had hap-
pened to it but what where
were the men where was the
freight

  through the thin air of daybreak
they heard that distant revolver shot
after that there were the muted
staccato barkings of a small-arm
battle

  while the governors were still
shouting conflicting orders a special
shout went up and the people fell
aside as if tossed by an invisible
plow and through this furrow-beau-
tiful as a dream-horse and as elusive
-they saw the horse of the bogdo
go trotting by

  torang

  torang they believed to be as holy
as its master they saw it saddled
but riderless unblemished uncannily
wise when it came to its keeping on
its way wasnt it likely that it was
ridden by a ghost

  it had come very close to that

  in less than a minute after wong
had fired-and died-shattuck recog-
nized that this was no place for an
abbots horse-or any horse he had

an overwhelming gust of pity for all
horses camels dogs-and men these
men had fought the gobi until they
were as cruel as the gobi itself
hed sent torang home

  this wasnt a chain of reasoning

  his reasoning all went into the
fight-clear precise perceptive with
a thousand eyes only opened in
times like these

  still with that revolver hed taken
from wong in his left hand and the
great scimitar in his right he
plunged on further into the pass

  already the place of his first stand
was being choked with cast boxes
and blue steel brought a flash of
clairvoyant memory hed seen thebe
self-same boxes and at least a part
of what was in them back in
samarkand

 he cut more pack ropes and
dodged camels slipped and strad-
dled and disappeared horses were
being kicked forward by hard-faced
mongols

  shattuck would remember those
faces when the world needed fight-
ers these were fighters but theyd
have to be led bled crucified to be
taught the things theyd known be-
fore when they conquered half the
world

one was poking a gun in his face
when shattuck dodged under the
horses belly and cut the gunman
down from the other side an in-
stant later hed fired his first shot
and had seen the horse jump from
under its rider as if the fellow had
been roped

  the confusion saved him a dozen
a score of times

  back he shouted or youll all
be killed

  ya-ming

  that was shorter sure death

  some of the riders were trying to
turn back to regain the desert

  camels were wretching moaning
captain trouble



grinding their teeth some thudded
to a fall and squalled as panic
wrenched them to their feet again

  a sudden weakness blew a breath
over shattuck it was like the first
whiff of the anaesthetic before an
operation but he felt no pain

  he gathered his nerves to a tighter
pitch

  ya-ming

  and that means you a calm
voice echoed in his brain

  let me do this first his thought
replied

  he was drawing the great blade
across another pack-tie when a mon-
gol struck down at him with the
loaded butt of a whip

 at the same moment shattuck
fired

  bullet and bludgeon both went
home

  im taking him with me was
the fighting fools last thought

xii

a bunch of the dokpas-faces
black with grease and their
dank hair making them look
like devils on a frolic-were looting
what they could find in the throat
of the wolf

  they screeched and laughed they
stripped the dead and kicked the dy-
ing leaving a number of naked and
humiliated corpses in their wake

  then they made the one gorgeous
and outstanding discovery of the
morning theyd not only found the
white devil of the preceding day-
he who had called himself shadak
khan-but leaning over him trying
to lift him trying to recall him to
life one of the most beautiful fe-
male creatures they had ever seen

  theyd all heard legends about the
kashmiri maidens they told filthy
stories of their own invention about
their affairs with such they
vaunted of local conquests that had

kashmiri conquests beaten a mile

  but here was the real thing so
they believed anyway it was the
first of her species any of them had
ever seen they crowded toward her
and the white man like a pack of
wolves at a spent doe

  mahree was no spent doe though
even if she had traveled for one full
day and one full night over a terrain
that would have strained a yak

  she turned to fire her eyes shone
green her forehead seemed to flat-
ten

  before the boldest of the dokpas
could carry out his plan of stepping
on shattucks face and seizing her
at the same time shed literally
brained him with a sliver of rock

  the unfortunate thing about this
was that it gave an idea to the more
cunning wits of the crowd the
dokpas also groped for rocks at
least two of them failed to do their
groping fast enough

  mahree threw a rock splinter with
the free-shoulder grace and power of
a professional ball-player-although
shed never seen one she scored two
perfect hits then a rock like the
end of a sledge-hammer caught her
shoulder and she staggered

  she was staggering trying not to
fall when she saw another sort of
lama coming through the gorge
hed seen what was happening his
hands were up he was shouting
things that mahree couldnt under-
stand but which the expression on
his face told her were prayers on
her own behalf and denunciation of
the dokpas

the black faces got his message
they turned on him with howls
one of them with a stone all ready
let fly at him and scraped his head
the young lama covered his face
with his hands and arms and kept on
coming


thrilling adventures

  it was his only way of fighting
back

  one of the black-face ruffians al-
ready had his hands on him when
from behind and above the young
lama a hand plunged down with a
knife in it that was one good knife
that was apt to be lost forever the
dokpa went down with the blade out
of sight in his shock of hair

  that was jumas knife it was
juma looking more than his six-foot
seven who had followed john day
here-champela whom hed found in
the lamasery of the soaring medita-
tion champela himself was just set-
ting out having heard that torang
the abbots horse had but then re-
turned without the shadak khan

champela and juma had then
run the length of the valley
but mahree even so had got there
first-a long first having followed
some instinct of her own

  juma cried to heaven as he tried
to pull his precious knife from the
dead mans skull it wouldnt come
it was a tussel as short as it was
fierce-jumas struggle with the
stubborn knife he was losing sec-
onds and in any sort of fight juma
never lost any time he spat on the
corpse and almost without looking
had found the throat of another
black face with his able hands

  the others were in full flight

  champela came to shattucks side
he lightly touched a temple he
thrust his fingers into shattucks
shirt

  it was clear that he thought at
first that shattuck was dead-the
end of a dream the eclipse of a
great adventure

  mahree with all that she had left
of consciousness-after that wallop
with a rock-centered in her eyes
let out the beginning of a wail

  ai-ya-ya i have killed him he

went away because of me and i
meant nothing i loved him only as
a sister

   hush said the prime minister of
shadak khan hes not dead

  it was a message that went up to
old juma too

   juma having just killed two men
one by stabbing and one by bare-
handed strangling was leaning over
with a great deep tenderness burn-
ing in the secret cavern back of his
old-eagle eyes

   allah akbar he said

  he gently pushed the prime min-
ister aside he stooped and picked
up captain trouble as if that famous
fighting fool was the merest in-
fant

  friend he said if you know
any effective magic ill see that you
get a couple of those runaway
camels

  get him quickly to the tent of
the governors john day said you
put them out and ill do my best

xiii

shattuck was getting well

as soon as they were able
to move him again theyd car-
ried him up the valley to the
lamasery of the soaring meditation
where there were some authentic
records of kubla khan

  theyd found-by a well authen-
ticated miracle it was claimed-
kublas sword where shadak khan
had dropped it when he fell-as he
thought-dead and the sword was
presented to the new khan by the
old dogpo himself-the divine in-
carnation who had the power it was
generally believed to look into the
past lives of others

  perhaps the good old man saw
something in some past life of this
modern captain trouble something
that linked him with the life of
kubla khan
captain trouble



  it was according to the secret
books about the time that an avatar
should come about to purge the
world before the coming of the
great new king

  the times were full of portent
tibet itself would have to be
purged there were mysteries in
tibet such as the world never
dreamed of john day said there
were hollow mountains he knew
about where the secret libraries of
the ages had been stored away

  couldnt you and i find them
shattuck asked

  wed find them all right but
how about the guardians

  what sort of guardians

  if i thought we had a right to
get into those caves wed get into
them said captain trouble

there you go i thought youd
had enough of fighting for a time
ill never have enough of it so
long as there is anything worth
fighting for

  unknown to shattuck there was a
scribe in the monastery making a
record of his stay some day it was
argued such a record might be as
valuable as such a one concerning
alexander the great would be

  and according to the horoscope
that three of the astrologers in three
different lamaseries cast up this man
shadak khan was going to have a
number of stirring adventures  

  he had one in fact before it was
considered advisable for him to leave
his bed

  he awoke one night to see a huge
dokpa crawling into his room on all
fours it was this fact that discov-
ered to shattuck the identity of the
man because walking on all fours
like that he revealed a limp in the
shoulder where hed been stopped by
a bullet the day he tried to saber
shattuck from behind

  ah go on and get out of here
you big bum said the fighting
fool in english

  and thats what the big bum did-
sneaked out and never showed him-
self again

  juma had sent for his people for
juma also would be lingering on in
the valley indefinitely hed become
as you might say the official steward
of the loot-camels horses boxes of
machine-guns small arms and am-
munition

  juma loved especially to sit in
when captain trouble and his prime
minister talked about cleaning up
some robber band or other and start-
ing an independent state where men
could be free and women happy and
everyone would get enough to eat-
with a few punitive expeditions now
and then just to keep your hand in

but best of all was when the two
of them were alone on some upper
terrace of the lamasery and the
earth so uptilted about them that it
almost seemed they were among the
stars then it was no mere correction
of some poor robber band that en-
grossed them they talked greatly
of great conquerors-men who had
been sent into the world to boost
men on-by struggle pain self-
mastery

  there was the inevitable struggle
between asia and europe-the never
surveyed frontiers of china and
russia for example the necessary
merging of nations that still hated
and feared each other there was the
growing challenge of africa-a rid-
dle as ancient and profound as that
of the great sphinx

  and when it was all over when
they had the world cleaned up why
maybe then theyd go back to amer-
ica and settle down like cincin-
natus on some quiet farm

  better man

 men did not dare to interfere with bully lafitte
 of the northland-until the day chet
 rand came along

 by harold de polo

  author of mr monks human freight the game goes on etc

of all the chechacos to come
in on the last boat of the
season they will tell you
chet rand looked the least likely to
gamely champion a husky he had
never laid eyes on before coming
down the gangplank and onto the
wharf landing with a bulging and
well-traveled grip in either hand it
actually seemed as if the weight of
them were too much for him so
much so at least that several of the

down-and-outers sprang hopefully
forward-but he shook his head nega-
tively with a pleasant smile

  setting down his luggage he drew
in deep breaths of air and comfor-
tably widened his legs as if perhaps
to get the feel of earth under them
after tedious days spent in cramped
quarters on shipboard

  it was as he stooped down to re-
gain his bags that the thing hap-
pened
the better man



  a big man with a barrel-like chest
over where freight was being un-
loaded had piled two boxes he had
just received on a sled to which a
single powerful dog was harnessed
the animal was straining mightily to
move the load but the steel runners
merely bit through the five or six
inches of fluffy snow and sank into
the ground

several onlookers were quizzing
the big fellow

  told yuh so lafitte one of them
raucously laughed

  bully lafitte turned with a snarl
at the phrase that so frequently
angers his black eyes burned and
the lifted upper lip showed ugly
teeth through his beard there was
venom in his voice

  she move by gar he said wen
i say she go-she go allons-allons
mon brave

  he sang the last at the husky but
he did not sing heartily encourag-
ingly as a man is apt to when urging
an animal there was a vicious threat
in it concretely followed by a raw-
hide whip that curled abouf the
huskys haunches

  the dog twitched spasmodically
under the blow but he did not
whimper or break from his stand
instead he gripped his feet further
in swelled out his great chest and
threw every ounce of strength into
the effort to drag that sled

  superb though he was presumed
to have as much power in his shoul-
ders as any dog in the northland he
failed to move it an inch it simply
could not be done

  bully must have been in a particu-
larly bad mood today his eyes
blazed

  wen i say go-she go

  brutally and with added force as
he cried the words he curled that
lash around the dog so that a red

welt with drops of bubbling blood
showed on one side of the white
belly

 easy warned a man in the
crowd youre goin too-

  you filthy hound

  at the words the circle of onlook-
ers instinctively parted as chet
rand-a stranger to every one there
-broke through and faced lafitte
color had come to his drawn cheeks
and his gray eyes were smoldering
with angry loathing

  his lips oddly enough did not
seem so sensitive they were pulled
taut in a bloodless line

  damn you he exclaimed while
the canuck stared at him as if he had
not fully gathered the import of that
first phrase cant you see that
youve been asking the impossible of
the dog cant you see that the poor
beggar cant do it you-you swine
wot-wot you mean dose for
mee-pour moi

  bully lafitte striking his chest
with a clenched fist finished with a
roar men in the north country as
a rule do not interfere between a
man and his dogs unless the thing
has gone pretty far more particu-
larly men did not interfere with la-
fitte no matter what the circum-
stances

  it came home to him now how-
ever that this stranger-this puny
chechaco-was actually calling him
names

   ound hein swine hein

with a bellow of rage he charg-
ed blindly crudely his great
arms flailing rand cool and poised
deftly side-stepped and sent his left
crashing in for his attackers jaw he
caught him squarely and though all
his body was behind that blow it
barely caused the canuck to hesitate

  his head went back for a moment
it is true but then he shook it off
as if tossing off some annoying insect


thrilling adventures

that had alighted on his face again
with a maddened bellow he charged

 a good many men there would
have stepped away from that rush-
nor could they altogether have been
blamed for doing so the newcomer
instead went forward with the look
of a battler who realizes that his
main gun has failed and that he
might as well get in another shot be-
fore he himself is beaten down

  once more cleanly rand found
that heavy-boned jaw with his left
and simultaneously drove in his right
to the pit of the stomach

  he got a grunted oof out of la-
fitte that was all then that ham-
mer-like right fist of the toughened
prospector caught him behind the ear
as he futilely tried to duck he went
up into the air like a mechanical
jumping jack his body stiffening
and then down onto the snow un-
conscious

   ound hein swine hein
georges lafitte standing over him
with swelling chest sucked the
words through his teeth in a whistle
as he lifted his boot-and there was
a growl from the husky as the animal
tried to hurl himself forward a
quiet voice though did what the dog
was unable to do

  no bootin lafitte

automatically the foot

stayed suspended in the air it
came down slowly and the big fellow
turned with sullen baffled anger
ee call me ound-swine ee
hask for eet square

  mayhap hes right said the other
calmly and youve beat him in fair
fight havent ye

  bully lafitte glared at the little
man facing him-glared at square
obrien the gambler a wisp of a
human not weighing a hundred and
ten pounds with a pair of the most
remarkably blue and chilling eyes
one could find

  ho w e -ho w e  lafitte
shrugged eef ees frend square
wy-

  hes no friend lafitte cut in
obrien who never evaded an issue
hes a man beaten who fought fair
and ill see that he gets a clean deal
himself

  ho well-

but chet rand just then came to
after one of the crowd had rubbed
him with snow he propped himself
up to a sitting posture

  rand got to his feet awkwardly
painfully he looked at the husky
he had defended and in the clear
wide-eyed gaze of the dog he saw
understanding-understanding and
gratitude

  care to sell that dog he asked

  the canuck turned his teeth show-
ing a smile of derision as he softly
brought out his words

  i sell hanytheeng i got msieu
but to you mon ami i geev thces
dog i oui-i geev him wen you
prove msieu you are bettaire man
than im be lak you call heem cest
men

  with a loud guffaw he turned his
back and again raised his foot he
completed his kick this time sending
the two boxes tumbling off the sleigh
as he ordered his husky to move on
-ordered him to move on without
the sting of the lash

 although chet rand had taken
a jolt that made every bone in
his head feel sore for several days
his championing of the husky did
him no harm bully lafitte was not
precisely a popular customer in the
northland

  lafitte was made to know when
several of the old sourdoughs had
heard of his tilt with rand and
the reason for it that if they again
heard of his maltreating a husky they
would personally step in-and not
use a fist
the better man



  should have given him a dose of
lead one of these veterans told
rand man deserves it-any time
he tries to kick another when hes
down for the count

  i dont carry a gun chet smiled
square obrien as well tried to
make chet rand see that he should
carry some sort of firearm he knew
lafitte he insisted and he knew that
he would never forgive rand-never
be satisfied until he had got even

  here too rand smilingly shook
his head and held out his hands say-
ing that he would depend on them
alone also he went a bit more into
detail in his explanations

  you see i dont want to offend
you or any one else mr obrien
he told the white-haired gambler
but im honestly against all killing
i cant help it-im just made that
way constitutionally i suppose if i
carried a gun it would be sure to
bring on a meeting sooner or later
for hed think i was arming myself
with that purpose in view also if i
did have a weapon and he drew id
probably do the same myself and one
of us would surely get it no ill
take my chances

  suit yourself son shrugged
square trouble with lafitte is
hes not a lad that comes out in the
open dont forget

  i wont thanks chet assured
him

  nothing seemed due to happen in
the near future however for lafitte
stocked up heavily with supplies and
mushed on for a cabin he had up on
the mackenzie rand for a time
rented one of the rooms that obrien
had above his gambling hall and just
lazed about seeming to enjoy hugely
the newness of this life that was so
different to him

  back home he had been an instruc-
tor in botany in a high school ever
since he had quit college some six

or seven years previously his one
great ambition however had been to
complete an exhaustive book on the
subject he loved

he had spent his every leisure
hour studying and compiling
notes the result had been an utter
physical and nervous breakdown that
had laid him up in a sanitarium for
seven long months with rigid orders
from the doctors when he left to get
away to an absolutely strange en-
vironment for ten or twelve months
and forget all about his cherished
hobby

  rand was a perfect patient the
medicos would have said had they
seen him now he obeyed commands
implicitly

 anyway he picked up surpris-
ingly in that first five or six weeks
so every one assured him at least

  hell son a rugged old-timer
who had heard of the lafitte affair
told him yell be able in another
coupla months to step in and plumb
beat that canuck to a pulp tell me
yeve taken on most fifteen pounds
they do

  it was thought a month later that
the thing might be put to the test

  lafitte had come to town leaving
his string of dogs with a half-breed
helper while he stepped into
obriens for his usual fling at the
roulette wheel rand coming down
the street had suddenly stopped as
he recognized the husky he had de-
fended and at the same time the dog
had struggled against the harness to-
ward the man with a sharp bark of
gladness

 rand had gone over to him a
pleased light in his eyes as he reached
out and stroked the huskys head he
stayed there for several minutes
playfully cuffing the animal and talk-
ing to him-and it was so that bully
lafitte found them

  you theenk shes time for try


thrilling adventures

prove ees belong to you msieu
the prospector asked with mock
politeness

  chets jaw muscles tautened but
he was a wise enough man to know
his own limitations he was not back
to normal yet he knew was a gener-
ous twenty pounds under weight
still and he was utterly certain it
would be folly for him to attempt to
pit himself against the powerful
canuck just at present

  when he did go into the next en-
counter if ever he at least wanted
in all fairness to himself to be in the
pink of condition so with a little
sigh he shook his head gravely and
answered

  no lafitte i dont think its quite
time sorry

  he had spoken coolly as if merely
stating an actual fact and as he
turned away after giving a final pull
to the huskys ear not a man there
somehow felt that he had evaded the
issue he had simply deferred it in
a business-like way

  youve a way with dogs son
obrien said to him the next morn-
ing that big lead husky o la-
littes is no gentle puppy with men
and even though he remembered yed
fought fer him i was surprised at
the gladness he showed to see ye

anyways i mind me that my
own string never take yer pres-
ence amiss and i was wonderin if
yed care to take them fer a bit of a
run tis saturday and my busiest
time and i cant get away

  i have an old running mate at
spruce valley-thirty odd miles
maybe-and hes needin grub with
a sick wife he cant leave would
you like to do me the favor chet
glad to rand assured him that
is if you think i can handle the dogs
ive watched others of course and i
think ive picked up the trick of it
but ive never had any experience

and i wouldnt want to be the cause
of anything happening to your-
shush shush broke in the
gambler i pride meself i can tell
a man that has a way with dogs
square obrien was right the
moment he stepped behind the laden
sled with the long whip that must
reach to the lead dog in his right
hand chet rand showed an almost
abnormal knack in handling the
string of huskies

he seemed to be able to get the
greatest amount of effort out of
the dogs with the least amount of ex-
ertion on his own part they liked
him instantly-liked him probably
because they sensed that here was a
human that would use no brutality
and yet who would stand for no
dawdling or bickering among them-
selves and the average sled ani-
mal doesnt ask much more

  anyway rand brought the string
back in such good condition that
obrien had a suggestion

  seein that yere one of the few
men that aint mad fer findin gold
what should be the matter with takin
my dogs and runnin a sort of freight
and express service the boys 
pay high and over to macleans
pass theyre still stampedin from all
sides twill be a favor to me-them
dogs are getting lazy

  youre a lifesaver every way to
me mr obrien was chets grate-
ful answer ill take that up

 from the start rand made good
at the thing as obrien had said
most men were too busy hunting for
gold to think of other pursuits and
the freighting of supplies had very
little competition

  chet learned to handle his long
rawhide whip like a master handled
it so well that it became nearer an
art with him he could send it curl-
ing out to crackle within a fraction
of an inch of the lead huskys ear
  and well back
 them with this
 amazing
 guarantee

    we are looking for more am-
    bitious young fellows with
    factory building-trade or any
    other kind of mechanical ex-
    perience to prepare for and
    help place in well-paid draft-
    ing positions such men we
    find are unusually successful
    as draftsmen because they know
    how things are done and thats
    a priceless asset to the man who
    makes the blueprint plans get in touch with us
    and well tell you how you can cash in on your
    entire past experience

 drafting is logically your next move

    of course
    ical work

 the output 	

    kven the skilled mechanic earning  to  a week
    has reached his limit he can never earn more and
    when he gets old he will earn less so we dont blame
    any man for wanting to get away from this futureless
    outlook for wanting to get into something where he
    can use his head as well as his hands-where he will
    ie paid for what he knows instead of only for what
    he does   

    tou know enough about blueprints to understand that
    plans govern every move in factory and
    construction jobs the draftsman who
    makes them is several jumps ahead of the
    workman who follows ihem and so we
    want you to know that drafting is
    a logical natural promotion from
    mechanical and building work - betler-
    paid more interesting-just the kind of
    work youd enjoy doing

thrilling adventures

without touching the animal and this
helps tremendously the driver the
dog remembers has complete control

  on one of his runs to macleans
pass after he had emerged from
some spruce covering and was per-
haps half way across a clearing that
was about a mile wide he suddenly
heard a commotion behind a knoll
not a hundred yards on the left-a
shrill bark a harsh curse a muffled
growl and looking hastily toward
the spot he saw a man and a dog
struggling on the horizon while a
rifle was tossed crazily into the air
as if it had been unexpectedly jolted
from the hands of the human

  the husky unmistakably was the
one he had defended and the man
just as surely was bully georges
lafitte

  chet rand did not pause swiftly
he got to the other side of his sled
shielding his body as much as he
could with the load he was carrying

with tense words that registered
instantly on obriens well-train-
ed string he urged the dogs to their
fastest pace they responded nobly
and foot by foot they cut down the
intervening distance between them
and the forest of blue-green spruce
that lay protectingly ahead

  at last they surged into the en-
gulfing safety of it and not until
then did the freight carrier allow his
tautened muscles to relax as a sigh
of relief exploded from him

  as he traveled on toward the pass
rand tried coolly to figure out
what had happened as near as he
could come to it lafitte had doubt-
less started out to ambush him leav-
ing his dog team somewhere in the
rear in some manner probably the
lead husky had got loose-a broken
leash he remembered seeing bore that
out- and had followed his owner

 whether the animal had sensed
that lafitte was out to get the man

that had championed him chet
wasnt sure he was certain however
that the arrival of the dog at the
critical moment had unquestionably
saved his life

  he kept his mouth closed about the
incident at mac leans pass just as
he remained silent about it with
obrien when he got back the next
day though he walked straight up
to lafitte when the latter swaggered
into the gambling hall

  lafitte he told him in words
that he knew would mean nothing to
his listeners but would nevertheless
cause them to be remembered did
anything happen ive written down
all the details about that little epi-
sode back in the clearing if any one
ever finds me with a bullet hole
through me itll make interesting
reading

  lafitte must have taken heed of the
warning for as winter wore on rand
was not troubled with him he knew
though that the ill-feeling between
them must eventually come to a
climax and he was almost wishing
that it would not be too far away

  powerful though the canuck in-
dubitably was chet felt that now

thrilling adventures

willing to admit being happy not to
be caught on the trail on this par-
ticular night

  as heavy storms wherever men
gather in colder climates will always
bring out memories of other storms
the poker and faro and roulette tables
at obriens were less frequented
than usual as the old sourdoughs
swapped lies beautifully each one
had a story to cap the other and be
it known that these men were no
niggards when it came to yarning
but although they didnt know it
drama was pushing toward them
through the storm

it entered in the form of a half-
breed-along about eleven that
night the man came crashing down
on the floor when the door was open-
ed at his feeble knock and it was all
he could dc breathlessly to gasp out
his words

  ees out dere-bout wan mile-
mackensie trl-msieu lafitte dog
-dog she all gone-los-excep de
big lead ees-ees mos gone-la
-lafitte

  the half-breed keeled over with
that and while square obrien effi-
ciently went to him with a flask of
brandy men looked questioningly at
one another in the hush that had sud-
denly fallen they spoke much those
looks of the contempt in which bully
lafitte was held

  there was no keen desire written
on any face to go to the rescue
there was only those inquiring
frowns that seemed to ask if any
man cared to save him and whether
it was worth while

  it was chet rand as the fire of
brandy brought the half-breed to
with a sputtering cough who spoke
first

  up to me boys he said quietly
no i dont want help-thanks
but son- began square

  youll understand mr obrien
broke in rand with a smile already
on his way to the door that led to
his room above the gambling hall

  he was gone and men argued heat-
edly as to which ones should accom-
pany him although obrien and a
few of the wiser old-timers smiled
knowingly a tribute to rand these
offers to go

 he was down again in a moment
pulling a parka over his head and
scrupulously examining his snow-
shoes asking obrien for the flask of
brandy that would undoubtedly help
lafitte

  damnit chet broke in a young
trapper i aint goint let yuh make
it alone

 there was gratitude in rands
smile and his serious gray eyes but
he shook his head firmly

  thanks jim he said but ive
got to go alone oh ill make it
trail along if im not back in four
or five hours if you feel like it jim
so long

  luck son

 it was those two words of
obriens as chet pulled open the
door that made the trapper and every
one else still their arguments

chet rand came back in what
was closer to four hours than five
-came back to be exact just a trifle
under the four mark he lurched in
through the wide door that was held
open for him the inert form of big
bully lafitte across his shoulders
and with the husky he had defended
pulling on ahead of him tied to his
belt with broken harness

  slowly carefully he eased his hu-
man burden on to the floor and even
as he staggered back and caught hold
of a table for support one mittened
hand went out to stroke the head of
the dog who was gazing up at him
with pure adoration

thrilling adventures

  i guess youre mine boy-i guess
youre mine now he was saying

  silently he handed his friend jim
the flask of brandy and the trapper
poured the last stiff dose that was
left down the throat of the canuck

  lafitte gurgling and spluttering
opened his eyes and gazed about
dazedly his voice a thick mutter

  i go down by gar-i go down
someow he was saying almost in-
credulously i don know i don
know dese legs she jus get too
weak for to stan shes hard going
out dere one dog go down-othaire
-nothaire-excep my strong devil
of the lead i don know i don-
an jean-wot appen wen all
theeng go black for me

  he was lifting himself up with a
hand now still swaying still dull-
eyed and groping-brained

  your jean came here-for help
said obrien curtly

  so-so

  georges lafitte got up then with
the help of a table and stood there
scrutinizing the knot of men from
between narrowed eyes he spoke
with a sharp intake of breath as if
fearing for the answer

  an oo breeng me in

  a better man than you are re-
plied chet rand quietly

  dere is no bet-taire man dan me
he cried savagely dere is no man
wot ave evaire knock me down-an
dere is no man wot ave evaire use
dese gun so quick

his hand as he finished went to
the heavy revolver that was
hanging low in the holster at his left
thigh and he grinned with scornful
invitation at rand

  but it was square obrien who
answered his face and voice very
calm as his own hand hovered casu-
ally in the neighborhood of his left
armpit

  hes proven himself a better man
every way lafitte-and i mind ye
what ye say there on the wharf on
that first snow of the winter

  and i claim the dog now said
chet you keeled over and i didnt
id just come in from a run from
spruce valley but i still had enough
left to finish your own trip for you
with you on my back

there was an assenting grunt or
so from some of the older sour-
doughs and it seemed to drive la-
fitte wild his teeth showing he
jutted out his head and glared bale-
fully at rand

  so shes put up job for get husky
non he snarled by gar i dont
stan for dose treeck georges la-
fitte don boy-why don you be
man all dose talk bout not believe
in gun-all dose talk bout not be-

geev you dose dog wen you prove
bet-taire man i mean pro-

  just a minute lafitte

  chet rand a dozen paces away
raised a hand that seemed to compel
silence the muscles of his face were
taut and he was nervously tapping
the top of his high moccasin with the
lash of a coiled rawhide whip in his
right hand

  you want gun-play do you he
continued as lafitte stared at him
with eager questioning well youll
get it draw-draw you filthy
hound

  wot

  lafitte as he hungrily cried the
word looked as if he thought it was
too good to be true but chet with
steady tense tones came right back
at him

  i said draw draw you low swine

thrilling adventures

  with fierce joy bully lafitte
flung his warning at the crowd as
his right arm pitched down toward
his thigh but even as his fingers went
to grip the blue-steeled butt of his
weapon that rawhide lash in chets
right hand coiled out like a striking
snake and wound itself around his
wrist

  dieu he shrieked as the whip
cut through his skin and flesh with
what must have been agonizing pain

  you had your chance and i beat
you to it lafitte chet was coolly
saying and im telling you again
that im the better man

the big canuck was rocking back-
ward and forward on his feet his
left hand gripping the ugly wound
on his wrist as his face twisted in
pain at the words of his opponent
however mad rage contorted his fea-
tures and he bellowed wildly

  bet-taire man eh by gar not
wile i got-

  those unharmed left fingers never
reached the revolver butt-for the
husky that had been standing tense-
muscled by rands side made his leap
in the nick of time

  fully and squarely with all the
power in his sturdy body behind the
charge he struck bully lafitte on
the chest down they went in a
tangled heap rolling over and over
as the dog sank his fangs into that
left hand

  break-break way there square
obrien said reaching down and
firmly taking the dog by the neck
with his other hand he yanked out
lafittes weapon and leveled it at the
bully get on your feet he or-
dered the dogs quieted dont
worry

  then as lafitte shakily managed
to right himself square obrien
spoke his ultimatum

  like i told ye before lafitte

rands proven himself a better man
and also like i told ye before i
mind me what ye said about the
husky tht day down at the wharf
im taking it upon meself anyway
now to be the judge and tis to chet
that im fair and square awarding
that dog

  and one other thing-out of this
place with ye and on a word of
honor thats never been broken bully
georges lafitte im telling ye that
do i ever see ye trailing into this
camp its i meself thatll shoot ye
down like the dog ye are

  i had to bring the thing to show-
down you see rand was explaining
later because i surely did want this
dog need him for a lead husky it
so happens because ive decided that
now im physically on my feet again
im going to stick up here at this
freight carrying game in my blood
this north country

  he paused for a moment a dull
flush creeping over his face as he
went on more haltingly

  i didnt like to speak of it before
this and i dont like to now but i
suppose its due some of you boys to
know why ive been so hanged much
against gun-play

  i-well i took a little over a year
off from college back in  and

i	got in the mix-up across the water

i	saw so much killing and so much
blood that i told myself id certainly
never be responsible for any more
unless i was forced into it by another
war i   

  chet rand laughed and looked
down at his whip making the dis-
tant tip of it curl back to him with a
deft flick of his wrist that was sheer
artistry

  no this old rawhides good enough
for me

  good enough is right chortled
