if by some means scientific of course one could
transport himself to another atom-or world-
what would he be likely to find if einstein is
right that all things are relative then size is too
in other words if we should be reduced in size
and the world we go into should be proportionately

you have read this story

the time hoaxers by paul bolton here is
something different-an unusual time-story treated
in a unique manner every generation leaves its
documentary records-some in the form of hiero-
glyphics carved in stone some in the form of pic-

waves and rays

   by t oconor sloane phd

but there is more to be said than this in all the physical
world nothing is more essential to the life of man than rays
without rays the universe would cease to exist for mankind and
all life would vanish this is a trite assertion for we all know
that we depend upon the sun for the heat necessary to existence
and for light and that heat and light reach us by rays exactly
what rays are is none too certain they are generally taken
as ether waves having given us the heat from the sun so
that we can live rays give us light from the same luminary so
that we can see but they do much more than this for the light
rays of the sun have much to do with our health and life

wireless communication is one of the wonders of the age and
it is carried out by waves of ether comparatively long con-
stituting rays these waves are so long that they carry neither
heat nor light but they are the vehicles or pathway as it may be
termed for all sorts of impressed waves and these impressed
upon them at the sending station give the sounds we listen to
from our radios with far too little amazement

rays tend to spread over the spherical elements of which
their point of origin is the center this spreading weakens their
power and forms one of the limitations to long-distance radio
work long ether waves are very intractable and are hard to
reflect and refract if we compare these qualities or factors to
the corresponding ones of light

as we approach the region of the spectrum the rays become
shorter and more tractable they can be reflected and refracted
and give us heat and light in the ultra-violet region of shorter
waves the actinic effects appear and these rays are used as
remedial agents they produce sun-burn the still shorter x-
rays produce another more intense and permanent burn and if
enough exposure is submitted to they can slowly maim and kill
they can pass through many substances lead is one of the best
shields

the millikan or cosmic ray is far more penetrative than the
x-ray and it is everywhere several feet thickness of lead is
needed to shield it off its waves are very short and now a
cheerful theory has been advanced to the effect that cosmic rays
act to kill us and that the cosmic rays may operate to shorten
our lives to eventually prove fatal to every man this curious
theory would make us immortal or nearly so if the cosmic rays
could be cut off

it is a strange thought and an interesting one that except for
the cosmic ray we might live for years of many generations

            jjhe subject of rays has been a great attraction for
speculative dreamers who picture to themselves
what rays may eventually be made to do rays are
invoked as acting upon distant objects some
years ago we were told of rays which directed
upon an automobile would bring it to rest inter-
fering with and nullifying the action of the electric ignition
system a ray that could do this would have a wonderful effect
in war an airplanes engine could be stopped and the aviator
would have to concernjjimselt with getting to a landing if
two fighting planes used the ray on each other both would go
down and be out of the fighting

  in the world war there were two achievements impressive
by their originality and effectiveness they also hold out a pos-
sibility of immense development one was the long range
paris gun as it is sometimes called this dropped shells of
about eight inches caliber into the city of paris some  miles
distant the shells reached an approximate vacuum as they
rose and their ballistic curve on this account must have ap-
proximated the parabola the projectiles did comparatively
little harm the effect was to frighten the enemy the an-
ticipation of the shells exploding in the heart of the city was
appalling the worst injury to life was when by an irony of
fate one of them broke down the roof of a crowded church
and killed a number of non-combatants

  suppose a ray could have been developed to interfere with the
infinitesimal action of the firing system of a gun-for every shot
solved a problem in higher mathematics-it would have seemed
like a nullification of the greatest efforts of the artillerists the
ray might have been produced in a distant airplane but no
such ray has been discovered

  the tank is destined to play an increasing part in future wars
it is being developed into a moving fortress if the ray which
can arrest the motion of a gas engine were a true story it could
do much to nullify the use of the tank for the latter must be
mobile without mobility it is reduced to uselessness or near
to it when the account of the ray we speak of first appeared
in the papers many believed the stor as it was told to the
effect that automobiles were brought to rest from a distance by
the new emanation the description read like a romance

  the above is merely imaginary and is written to bring out
the fact that there are undreamed of possibilities of developments
in rays and that it is not safe to limit these possibilities


beginning a thrilling new serial

of interplanetary life and travel	part i

  edward e smith phd

   author of skylark of space  and skylark three

sp acehounds

  of ipc

 good many of us who are now certain beyond a doubt that space travel
jl jl will forever remain in the realm of the impossible probably would if a
rocket that were shot to the moon for instance did arrive and perhaps return to
give proof of its safe arrival on our satellite accept the phenomenon in a per-
fectly blase twentieth century manner dr smith that phenomenal writer of
classic scientific fiction seems to have become so thoroughly convinced of the
advent of interplanetary travel that it is difficult for the reader to feel after
finishing spacehounds of ipc  that travel in the great spaces is not already
an established fact dr smith as a professional chemist is kept fairly busy
as a writer he is satisfied with nothing less than perfection for that reason a
masterpiece from his pen has become almost an annual event we know you
will like spacehounds even better than the skylark series

chapter i

the ipv arcturus sets out for mars

a narrow football of steel the interplanetary
vessel arcturus stood upright in her berth in
the clock like an egg in its cup a hundred
feet across and a hundred and seventy feet
deep was that gigantic bowl its walls sup-
ported by the structural steel and concrete of the dock
and lined with hard-packed bumper-layers of hemp and
fibre high into the air extended the upper half of the
ship of space-a sullen gray expanse of fifty-inch
hardened steel armor curving smoothly upward to a
needle prow countless hundred of fine vertical scratches
marred every inch of her surface and here and there the
stubborn metal was grooved and scored to a depth of
inches-each scratch and score the record of an attempt
of some wandering cosmic body to argue the right-of-
way with the stupendous mass of that man-made cruiser
of the void

  a burly young man made his way through the throng
about the entrance nodded unconcernedly to the gate-
keeper and joined the stream of passengers flowing
through the triple doors of the double air-lock and down
a corridor to the center of the vessel however instead
of entering one of the elevators which were whisking the
passengers up to their staterooms in the upper half of
the enormous football he in some way caused an opening
to appear in an apparently blank steel wall and stepped
through it into the control room

  hi breck the burly one called as he strode up to
the instrument-desk of the chief pilot and tossed his bag
carelessly into a corner behold your computer in the
flesh whats all this howl and fuss about poor com-
putation 

  hello steve  the chief pilot smiled as he shook
hands cordially glad to see you again-but dont try to
kid the old man im simple enough to believe almost
anything but some things just arent being done we
have been yelling and yelling hard for trained com-
puters ever since they started riding us about every one-

  no more an i-p computer than i am a digger indian
  they dont shoot sparrows with coast-defense guns
  thanks for the compliment breck but im your com-
  puter for this trip anyway newton the good old egg
  knows what you fellows are up against and is going to
  do something about it if he has to lick all the rest of
  the directors to do it he knew that i was loose for a
  couple of weeks and asked me to come along this trip
  to see what i could see im to check the observatory
  data-they dont know im aboard-take the peaks and
  valleys off your acceleration curve if possible and re-
  port to newton just what i find out and what i think
  should be done about it how early am i  while the
  newcomer was talking he had stripped the covers from
  a precise scale model of the solar system and from a
  large and complicated calculating machine and had set
  to work without a wasted motion or instant-scaling off
  upon the model the positions of the various check-stations
  and setting up long and involved integrals and equations
  upon the calculator

    the older man studied the broad back of the younger
 bent over his computations and a tender almost fatherly
 smile came over his careworn face as he replied

   early you just like you always were-plus fif-
 teen seconds on the deadline the final dope is due right
 now he plugged the automatic recorder and speaker
 into a circuit marked observatory waited until a tiny
 light above the plug flashed green and spoke

 ber forty-three twenty-nine ready for final supplemen-

 along the scheduled route came promptly from the

-	speaker you must stay further away from the plane
 of the ecliptic the ether will be clear for you along
 route e-p-w-k-r-s-m you will hold a
 constant acceleration of  centimeters between
 initial and final check stations your take-off will be
 practically unobstructed but you will have to use the ut-
 most caution in landing upon mars because in order to
 avoid a weightless detour and a loss of thirty-one
 minutes you must pass very close to both the martian
 satellites to do so safely you must pass the last
 meteorological station m on schedule time plus or
 minus five seconds at scheduled velocity plus or minus
 ten meters with exactly the given negative acceleration
 of  centimeters and exactly upon the pilot ray
 m will have set for you

    all x breckenridge studied his triplex chronometer
 intently then unplugged and glanced around the control
 room in various parts of which half a dozen assistants
 were loafing at their stations

   control and power check-out-hipe he barked
 driving converters and projectors

    the first assistant scanned his meters narrowly as he
 swung a multi-point switch in a flashing arc converter

 bers one to forty-five inclusive all x

  the second assistant was galvanized into activity and
upon a screen before him there appeared a view as
though he were looking directly upward from the prow
of the great vessel the air above them was full of air-
craft of all shapes and sizes and occasionally the image
of one of that flying horde flared into violet splendor
upon the screen as it was caught in the mighty roving
beam of one of the twelve ultra-light projectors under
test

  upper lights and lookout plates-all x the second
assistant reported and other assistants came to attention
as the check-out went on

  lower lights and lookout plates

  all x was the report after each of the twelve
ultra-lights of the stern had swung around in its support-

  having thus checked and tested every function of his
department breckenridge plugged into captain and
when the green light went on

  chief pilot check-out-all x he reported briefly
all x acknowledged the speaker and the chief pilot
unplugged fifteen minutes remained during which
time one department head after another would report
to the captain of the liner that everything in his charge
was ready for the stupendous flight

  all x steve breckenridge turned to the computer
how do you check acceleration and power with the
observatory 

  not so good old bean the younger man frowned
in thought they figure like astronomers not naviga-
tors theyve made no allowances for anything not
even the reversal-and i figure four thousands for that
and for minor detours then theres check station
errors   

  check-station errors why theyre always right-
thats what theyre for

  dont fool yourself-theyve got troubles of their
own the same as anybody else in fact from a study of
the charts of the last few weeks im pretty sure that e
is at least four thousand kilometers this side of where he
thinks he is that w is ten or twelve thousand beyond
his station and that theyve both got a lateral displace-
ment thats simply fierce im going to check up and
argue with them about it as we pass then theres
another thing-they figure to only two places and weve
got to have the third place almost solid if we expect
to get a smooth curve a hundredth of a centimeter of
acceleration means a lot on a long trip when theyre hold-
ing us as close as they are doing now well ride this
trip on  centimeters-with our scheduled mass
that means thirty six points of four seven kilofranks
plus equilibrium power all set to go the computer
stated as he changed by fractions of arc the course-
plotters of the automatic integrating goniometer
spacehounds of ipc



  youre the doctor-but im glad its you thatll have
to explain to the observatory and breckenridge set his
exceedingly delicate excess power potentiometer exactly
upon the indicated figure well weve got a few
minutes left for a chin-chin before we lift her off

  whats all this commotion about dish out the
low-down

  well its like this steve we pilots are having one
sweet time-were being growled at on every trip the
management squawks if were thirty seconds plus or
minus at the terminals and the passenger department
squalls if we change acceleration five centimeters total
en route-claims it upsets the dainty customers and loses
business for the road theyre tightening up on us all
the time a couple of years ago you remember it didnt
make any difference what we did with the acceleration
as long as we checked in somewhere near zero time-
we used to spin em dizzy wthen we reversed at the half-
way station-but that kind of stuff doesnt go any more
weve got to hold the acceleration constant and close to
normal got to hold our schedule on zero plus or minus
ten seconds and yet weve got to make any detours they
tell us to such as this seven-million kilometer thing they
handed us just now to make things worse weve got
to take orders at every check-station and yet we get the
blame for everything that happens as a consequence of
obeying those orders of course i know as well as you
do that its rotten technique to change acceleration at
every check-station but weve told em over and over
that we cant do any better until they put a real computer
on every ship and tell the check-stations to report mete-
orites and other obstructions to us and then to let us
alone so youd better recommend us some computers

  youre getting rotten computation thats a sure thing
and i dont blame you pilots for yelling but i dont
believe that youve got the right answer i cant help but
think that the astronomers are lying down on the job
they are so sure that you pilots are to blame that it
hasnt occurred to them to check up on themselves very
carefully however well know pretty quick and then
well take steps

  i hope so-but say steve im worried about using
that much plus equilibrium power remember weve got
to hit m in absolutely good shape or plenty heads will
drop

   ill say they will i know just how the passengers will
howl if we hold them weightless for half an hour wait-
ing for those two moons to get out of the way and i
know just what the manager will do if we check in minus
thirty-one minutes wow hell swell up and bust sure
but dont worry breck-if we dont check in all right
anybody can have my head that wants it and im taking
full responsibility you know

  youre welcome to it breckenridge shrugged and
turned the conversation into a lighter vein speaking
of weightlessness its funny how many weight-fiends
there are in the world isnt it youd think the passen-
gers would enjoy a little weightlessness occasionally-
especially the fat ones-but they dont but say while
i think of it how come you were here and loose to make
this check-up i thought you were out with the other
two of the big three solving all the mysteries of the
universe

  had to stay in this last trip-been doing some work
on the ether force-field theory and other advanced stuff
that i had to go to mars and venus to get just got back

last week as for solving mysteries laugh while you
can old hyena you and a lot of other dim bulbs think
that roesers rays are the last word-that theres
nothing left to discover-are going to get jarred loose
from your hinges one of these days when i came in
nine months ago they were hot on the trail of something
big and ill bet they bring it in  

  out upon the dock an insistent siren blared a cres-
cendo and diminuendo blast of sound and two minutes
remained in every stateroom and in every lounge and
saloon speakers sounded a warning

  for a short time while we are pulling clear of the
gravitational field of the earth walking will be some-
what difficult as everything on board will apparently in-
crease in weight by about one-fifth of its present amount
please remain seated or move about with caution in
about an hour weight will gradually return to normal
we start in one minute

   hipe barked the chief pilot as a flaring purple light
sprang into being upon his board and the assistants came
to attention at their stations seconds four three
two one lift he touched a button and a set
of plunger switches drove home releasing into the forty-
five enormous driving projectors the equilibrium power
-the fifteen-thousand-and-odd kilofranks of energy
that exactly counterbalanced the pull of gravity upon the
mass of the cruiser simultaneously there was added
from the potentiometer already set to the exact figure
given by the computer the -equilibrium power-
which would not be changed throughout the journey if
the ideal acceleration curve were to be registered upon
the recorders-and the immense mass of the cruiser of
the void wafted vertically upward at a low and constant
velocity the bellowing shrieking siren had cleared the
air magically of the swarm of aircraft in her path and
quietly calmly majestically the arcturus floated upward

breckenridge sixty seconds after the initial lift
actuated the system of magnetic relays which would 
gradually cut in the precisely measured starting power
which it would be necessary to employ for sixty-nine
minutes-for without the acceleration given by this ad-
ditional power they would lose many precious hours of
time in covering merely the few thousands of miles dur-
ing which earths attraction would operate powerfully
against their progress

  faster and faster the great cruiser shot upward as
more and more of the starting power was released and
heavier and heavier the passengers felt themselves be-
come soon the full calculated power was on and the
acceleration became constant weight no longer in-
creased but remained constant at a value of plus twenty
three and six-tenths percent for a fewt moments there
had been uneasy stomachs among the passengers-per-
haps a few of the first-trippers had been made ill-but
it was not much worse than riding in a high-speed ele-
vator particularly since there was no change from posi-
tive to negative acceleration such as is experienced in
express elevators

  the computer his calculations complete watched the
pilot with interest for accustomed as he was to traversing
the depths of space there was a never-failing thrill to
his scientific mind in the delicacy and precision of the
work which breckenridge was doing-work which could
be done only by a man who had had long training in the
profession and who was possessed of instantaneous ner-

vous reaction and of the hightest degree of manual dex-
terity and control under his right and left hands were
the double-series potentiometers actuating the variable-
speed drives of the flight-angle directors in the hour and
declination ranges before his eyes was the finely marked
micrometer screen upon which the guiding goniometer
threw its needle-point of light powerful optical systems
of prisms and lenses revealed to his sight the director-
angles down to fractional seconds of arc it was the
task of the chief pilot to hold the screened image of the
cross-hairs of the two directors in such position relative
to the ever-moving point of light as to hold the mighty
vessel precisely upon its course in spite of the complex
system of forces acting upon it

  for almost an hour breckenridge sat motionless his
eyes flashing from micrometer screen to signal panel
his sensitive fingers moving the potentiometers through
minute arcs because of what he saw upon the screen and
in instantaneous response to the flashing multicolored
lights and tinkling signals of his board finally far from
earth the moons attraction and other perturbing forces
comparatively slight the signals no longer sounded and
the point of light ceased its irregular motion becoming
almost stationary the chief pilot brought both cross-
hairs directly upon the brilliant point which for some
time they had been approaching more and more nearly
adjusted the photo-cells and amplifiers which would hold
them immovably upon it and at the calculated second
of time cut out the starting power by means of another
set of automatically timed relays when only the regu-
lar driving power was left and the acceleration had been
checked and found to be exactly the designated value of

	centimeters he stood up and heaved a profound
sigh of relief

  well steve thats over with-were on our way im
always glad when this part of it is done

  its a ticklish job no fooling-even for an expert
the mathematician agreed no wonder the astronomers
think you birds are the ones who are gumming up their
dope well its about time to plug in on e heres
where the fireworks start he closed the connections
which transferred the central portion of the upper look-
out screen to a small micrometer screen at breckenridges
desk and plugged it into the first check-station instantly
a point of red light surrounded by a vivid orange circle
appeared upon the screen low down and to the left of
center and the timing galvanometer showed a wide posi-
tive deflection

  hashed again growled breckenridge i must be
losing my grip i guess i put everything i had on that
sight and missed it ten divisions i think ill turn in my
badge-ive cocked our perfect curve already before we
got to the first check-station his hands moved toward
the controls to correct their course and acceleration

  as you were-hold everything lay off those con-
trols  snapped the computer theres something
screwy just as i thought-and it isnt you either im
no pilot of course but i do know good compensation
when i see it and if you werent compensating that point
i never saw it done besides with your skill and my
figures i know darn well that we arent off more than
a tenth of one division hes cuckoo dont call him-
let him start it and refer him to me

  all x-ill be only too glad to pass the buck but
i still think steve that youre playing with dynamite
who ever heard of an astronomer being wrong

  youd be surprised grinned the physicist since this
fuss has just started nobody has tried to find out whether
they were wrong dr not   

  ipv arcturus attention came from the speaker
curtly

  ipv arcturus breckenridge from the chief pilot
you have been on my ray almost a minute why are
you not correcting course and acceleration

  doctor stevens is computing us and has full control
of course and acceleration replied breckenridge he
will answer you

  i am changing neither course nor acceleration be-
cause you are not in position declared stevens crisply
please give me your present supposed location and your
latest precision goniometer bearings on the sun the moon
mars venus and your tellurian reference limb with
exact time of observations gyroscope zero-planes and
goniometer factors

  correct at once or i shall report you to the observa-
tory e answered loftily paying no attention to the
demand for proof of position

  be sure you do that guy-and while youre at it re-
port that your station hasnt taken a precision bearing
in a month report that youve been muddling along on
radio loop bearings and that you dont know where you
are within seven thousand kilometers and speaking of
reporting-i know already that a lot of you astronomical
guessers have only the faintest possible idea of where
you really are plus minus or lateral and if you dont
get yourselves straightened out before we get to w
im going to make a report on my own account that will
jar some of you birds loose from your upper teeth he
unplugged with a vicious jerk and turned to the pilot
with a grin

  guess thatll hold him for a while wont it

  hell report us sure remonstrated breckenridge
the older man was plainly ill at ease at this open defiance
of the supposedly infallible check-stations

  not that baby returned the computer confidently
ill bet you a small farm against a plugged nickel that
right nowt hes working his goniometer so hard that its
pivots are getting hot hell sneak back into position as
soon as he can calculate his results and pretend hes al-
ways been there

  the others will be all right then probably by the
time we get to them

  gosh no-youre unusually dumb today breck he
wont tell anybody anything-he doesnt want to be the
only goat does he 

  oh i see how could you dope this out with only
the recorder charts

  because i know the kind of stuff you pilots are-and
those humps are altogether too big to be accounted for
by anything i know about you another thing-the next
station p i think is keeping himself all x if so when
you corrected for e which was wrong itd throw you
all off on p which was right and so on--a bad hump
at almost every check-station see

true to prediction the pilot ray of p came in al-
most upon the exact center of the micrometer screen
and breckenridge smiled in relief as he began really to
enjoy the trip

  how do we check on chronometers  asked p when
stevens had been introduced by my time you seem
to be about two and a half seconds plus
spacehounds of ipc



  all x-two points four seconds plus-were riding on

	centimeters to allow for the reversal and for
minor detours bye

  all this may have been coincidence breck but well
find out pretty quick now the computer remarked when
the flying vessel was nearing the third check-station
unless im all out of control well check in almost four-
teen seconds minus on w and we may not even find
him on the center block of the screen

  when he plugged in w was on the block but was
in the extreme upper right corner they checked in
thirteen and eight-tenths seconds minus on the station
and a fiery dialogue ensued when the computer questioned
the accuracy of the location of the station and refused
point-blank to correct his course

  well breck old onion that tears it stevens de-
clared as he unplugged no use going any further on
these bum reference points im going to report to new-
ton-hell rock the observatory on its foundations he
plugged into the telegraph room have you got a free
high-power wave    please put me on newton in
the main office

  moving lights flashed and flickered for an instant upon
the communicator screen settling down into a white glow
which soon resolved itself into the likeness of a keen-eyed
gray-haired man seated at his desk in the remote office
of the interplanetary corporation newton smiled as
he recognized the likeness of stevens upon his own
screen and greeted him cordially

  have you started your investigation doctor
stevens 

  started it ive finished it and stevens tersely re-
ported what he had learned concluding so you see
you dont need special computers on these ships any more
than a hen needs teeth youve got all the computers
you need in the observatories-all youve got to do is
make them work at their trade

  the piloting was all x then 

  absolutely-our curve so far is exactly flat ever since
we cut off the starting power of course all the pilots
cant be as good as breckenridge but give them good
computation and good check points and you shouldnt
get any humps higher than about half a centimeter
theyll get both from now on the director assured
him thanks if your work for the trip is done you
might show my little girl nadia around the arcturus
shes never been out before and will be interested
would you mind

  glad to mr newton-ill be a regular uncle to her
thanks again operator ill speak to captain king
please

  pipe down that guff you unlicked cub or ill crown
you with a proof-bar the chief pilot growled as soon
as stevens had unplugged

  you and who else retorted the computer cheerfully
pipe down yourself guy-if you werent so darn dumb
and didnt have such a complex youd know that youre
the crack pilot of the outfit and wouldnt care who else
knew it stevens carefully covered and put away the
calculating machine and other apparatus he had been us-
ing and turned again to the pilot

  i didnt know newton had any kids especially little
ones or id have got acquainted with them long ago of
course i dont know him very well since i never was
around the office much but the old tiger goes over big
with me

  hm-m think youll enjoy playing nursemaid
all the rest of the trip breckenridge asked caustically
but with an enigmatic smile

  think so i know so replied stevens positively
i always did like kids and they always did like me-we
fall for each other like ten thousand bricks falling down
a well why a kid-any kid-and i team up just like
grace and poise    whats gnawing on you anyway
to make you turn cheshire cat all of a sudden by the
looks of that grin id say you had swallowed a canary
of mine some way or other but darned if i know that
ive lost any and he stared at his friend suspiciously

  to borrow your own phrase steve youd be sur-
prised  and breckenridge though making no effort
to conceal his amusement would say no more

  in a few minutes the door opened and through it
there stepped a grizzled four-striper almost hidden be-
hind his massive form there was a girl who ran up to
breckenridge and seized both his hands her eyes spark-
ling

  hi breckie you old darling i knew that if we both
kept after him long enough dad would let me ride with
you sometime isnt this gorgeous

  stevens was glad indeed that the girls enthusiastic
greeting of the pilot was giving him time to recover from
his shock for director newtons little girl nadia was
not precisely what he had led himself to expect little
she might be particularly when compared with the giant
frame of captain king or with steves own five-feet-
eleven of stature and the hundred and ninety pounds of
rawhide and whalebone that was his body but child
she certainly was not her thick fair hair cut in the
square bob that was the mode of the moment indicated
that nature had intended her to be a creamy blonde
but as she turned to be introduced to him stevens re-
ceived another surprise-for she was one of those rare
but exceedingly attractive beings a natural blonde with
brown eyes and black eyebrows sun and wind had
tanned her satin skin to a smooth and even shade of
brown and every movement of her lithe and supple
body bespoke to the discerning mind a rigidly-trained
physique

  doctor stevens you havent met miss newton i
hear the captain introduced them informally all the
officers who are not actually tied down at their posts are
anxious to do the honors of the vessel but as i have
received direct orders from the owners i am turning
her over to you-you are to show her around

  thanks captain i wont mutiny a bit against such
an order im mighty glad to know you miss newton

  ive heard a lot about you doctor dad and breckie
here are always talking about the big three-what you
have done and what you are going to do i want to
meet doctor brandon and doctor westfall too and her
hand met his in a firm and friendly clasp she turned
to the captain and stevens noticing that the pilot with a
quizzical expression was about to say something silenced
him with a fierce aside

  clam it ape or ill climb up you like a squirrel he
hissed and the grinning breckenridge nodded assent to
this demand for silence concerning children and nurse-
maids

  since youve never been out miss newton youll
want to see the whole works stevens addressed the girl
where do you want to begin shall we start at the
top and work down


amazing stories

  all right with me she agreed and fell into step
beside him she was dressed in dove-gray from head to
foot-toque blouse breeches heavy stockings and shoes
were of the one shade of smooth lustrous silk and as
they strolled together down the passage-way the effort-
less ease and perfect poise of her carriage called aloud
to every hard-schooled fibre of his own highly-trained
being

  were a lot alike you and i-do you know it he
asked abruptly and unconventionally

  yes ive felt it too she replied frankly and studied
him without affectation it has just come to me what
it is were both in fine condition and in hard training
youre an athlete of some kind and im sure youre a
star-i ought to recognize you but im ashamed to say
i dont what do you do 

  swim

  oh of course-stevens the great olympic high and
fancy diver i would never have connected our own
doctor stevens the eminent mathematical physicist with
the king of the springboard say ever since i quit
being afraid of the water ive had a yen to do that two-
and-a-half twist of yours but i never met anybody who
knew it well enough to teach it to me and ive almost
broken my back forty times trying to learn it alone
ive got you now too-american and british wo-
mens golf champion shake and the two shook hands
vigorously in mutual congratulation tell you what-
ill give you some pointers on diving and you can show
me how to make a golf ball behave next to norman
brandon ive got the most vicious hook in captivity-and
norm cant help himself hes left-handed you know
and being a southpaw hes naturally wild he slices all
his woods and hooks all his irons im consistent any-
way-i hook everything even my putts

  its a bargain what do you shoot

  pretty dubby usually in the middle eighties-none
of us play much being out in space most of the time
you know-sometimes when my hook is going particu-
larly well i go up into the nineties

  well lick that hook she promised as they entered
an elevator and were borne upward toward the prow
of the great interplanetary cruiser

             chapter ii
         -but does not arrive

 all out-we climb the rest of the way on foot
stevens told his companion as the elevator
jl jl stopped at the uppermost passenger floor
they walked across the small circular hall and the guard
on duty came to attention and saluted as they approached
him

  i have orders to pass you and miss newton sir do
you know all the combinations

  i know this good old tub better than the men that
built her-i helped calculate her stevens replied as he
stepped up to an apparently blank wall of steel and
deftly manipulated an almost invisible dial set flush with
its surface this is to keep the passengers where they
belong he explained as a section of the wall swung
backward in a short arc and slid smoothly aside we
will now proceed to see what makes it tick

  ladder after ladder of steel they climbed and bulk-
head after bulkhead opened at stevenss knowing touch

at each floor the mathematician explained to the girl
the operation of the machinery there automatically at
work-devices for heating and cooling devices for cir-
culating maintaining and purifying the air and the
water-in short all the complex mechanism necessary
for the comfort and convenience of the human cargo of
the liner

  soon they entered the conical top compartment a
room scarcely fifteen feet in diameter tapering sharply
upward to a hollow point some twenty feet above them
the true shape of the room however was not immedi-
ately apparent because of the enormous latticed beams
and girders which braced the walls in every direction
the air glowed with the violet light of the twelve great
ultra-light projectors like searchlights with three-foot
lenses which lined the wall the floor beneath their
feet was not a level steel platform but seemed to be
composed of many lenticular sections of dull blue
alloy

  we are standing upon the upper lookout lenses arent
we asked the girl is that perfectly all right

  sure theyre so hard that nothing can scratch
them and of course roesers rays go right through our
bodies or any ordinary substance like a bullet through
a hole in a swiss cheese even those lenses wouldnt
deflect them if they werent solid fields of force

  as he spoke one of the ultra-lights flashed around in
a short quick arc and the girl saw that instead of the
fierce glare she had expected it emitted only a soft
violet light nevertheless she dodged involuntarily and
stevens touched her arm reassuringly

  all x miss newton-theyre as harmless as mice
they hardly ever have to swing past the vertical and
even if one shines right through you you can look it
right in the eye as long as you want to-it cant hurt
you a bit

  no ultra-violet at all

  none whatever just a color-one of the many re-
maining crudities of our ultra-light vision a lot of
good men are studying this thing of direct vision though
and it wont be long before we have a system that will
really work

  i think its all perfectly wonderful she breathed
just think of traveling in comfort through empty space
and of actually seeing through seamless steel walls with-
out even a sign of a window how can such things be
possible 

  ill have to go pretty well back he warned and
any adequate explanation is bound to be fairly deep
wading in spots how technical can you stand it

  i can go down with you middling deep-i took a lot
of general science and physics through advanced me-
chanics of course i didnt get into any such highly
specialized stuff as sub-electronics or roesers rays but
if you start drowning me ill yell

  thats fine-you can get the idea all x with that
to go on lets sit down here on this girder roeser
didnt do it all by any means even though he got credit
for it-he merely helped the martians do it the whole
thing started of course when coddard shot his first
rocket to the moon and was intensified when roeser so
perfected his short waves that signals were exchanged
with mars-signals that neither side could make any
sense out of goddards pupils and followers made
bigger and better rockets and finally got one that could
land safely upon mars roeser who was a mighty keen
spacehounds of ipg



bird was one of the first voyagers and he didnt come
back-he stayed there living in a space-suit for three
or four years and got a brand-new education martian
science always was hot you know but they were im-
practical they were desperately hard up for water and
air and while they had a lot of wonderful ideas and
theories they couldnt overcome the practical technical
difficulties in the way of making their ideas work now
putting other peoples ideas to work was roesers long
suit-dont think that im belittling roeser at all either
for he was a brave and far-sighted man was no mean
scientist and was certainly one of the best organizers
and synchronizers the world has ever known-and since
martian and tellurian science complemented each other
so that one filled in the gaps of the other it wasnt long
until fleets of space-freighters were bringing in air and
water from venus which had more of both than she
needed or wanted

  having done all he could for the martians and hav-
ing learned most of the stuff he wanted to know roeser
came back to tellus and organized interplanetary with
scientists and engineers on all three planets and set to
work to improve the whole system for the vessels they
used then were dangerous-regular mankillers in fact
at about this same time roeser and the interplanetary
corporation had a big part in the unification of the
world into one nation so that wars could no longer in-
terfere with progress

               ntrduction i can down to funda-
 vv mentals molecules are particles of the first
order and vibrations of the first order include sound
light heat electricity radio and so on second order
atoms-extremely short vibrations such as hard x-rays
third order electrons and protons with their accom-
panying millikan or cosmic rays fourth order sub-
electrons and sub-protons these in the material as-
pect are supposed to be the particles of the fourth order
and in the energy aspect they are known as roesers
rays that is these fourth-order rays and particles
seem to partake of the nature of both energy and mat-
ter following me

  right behind you she assured him she had been
listening intently her wide-spaced brown eyes fastened
upon his face

  since these roesers rays or particles or rays of
the fourth order seem to be both matter and energy
and since the rays can be converted into what is sup-
posed to be the particles they have been thought to be
the things from which both electrons and protons were
built therefore everybody except norman brandon
has supposed them the ultimate units of creation so
that it would be useless to try to go any further   

  why we were taught that they are the ultimate
units she protested

  i know you were-but we really dont know any-
thing except what we have learned empirically even
about our driving forces what is called the fourth-
order particle is absolutely unknown since nobody has
been able to detect it to say nothing of determining its
velocity or other properties it has been assumed to
have the velocity of light only because that hypothesis
does not conflict with observational data im going to
give you the generally accepted idea since we have
nothing definite to offer in its place but i warn you that
that idea is very probably wrong theres a lot of deep

stuff down there hasnt been dug up yet in fact
brandon thinks that the product of conversion isnt
what we think it is at all-that the actual fundamental
unit and the primary mechanism of the transformation
lie somewhere below the fourth order and possibly even
below the level of the ether-but we havent been able
to find a point of attack yet that will let us get in any-
where however im getting way ahead of our sub-
ject to get back to it energy can be converted into
something that acts like matter through roesers rays
and that is the empirical fact underlying the drive of
our space-ships as well as that of almost all other
vehicles on all three planets power is generated by the
great waterfalls of tellus and venus-waters mighty
scarce on mars of course so most of our plants there
use fuel-and is transmitted on light beams by means of
powerful fields of force to the receptors wherever they
may be the individual transmitting fields and re-
ceptors are really simply matched-frequency units each
matching the electrical characteristics of some particular
and unique beam-of force this beam is composed of
roesers rays in their energy aspect it took a long
time to work out this tight-beam transmission of power
but it was fairly simple after they got it

  he took out a voluminous notebook at the sight of
which nadia smiled

  a computer might forget to dress but youd never
catch one without a full magazine pencil and a lot of
blank paper he grinned in reply and went on writing
as he talked

  for any given frequency f and phase angle tlieta
you integrate between limits zero and pi divided by two
sine theta d  

  hold it-im sinking nadia exclaimed i dont
integrate at all unless it is absolutely necessary as
long as you stick to general science im right on your
heels but please lay off of integrations and all that-
most especially stay away from those terrible electrical
integrations i always did think that they were the
most poisonous kind known i want only a general idea
-thats all that i can understand anyway

  sure i forgot-guess i was getting in deeper than
is necessary especially since this whole thing of beaxn
transmission is pretty crude yet and is bound to change
a lot before long there is so much loss that when we
get more than a few hundred million kilometers away
from a power-plant we lose reception entirely but to
get going again the receptors receive the beam and from
them the power is sent to the accumulators where it is
stored these accumulators are an outgrowth of the
storage battery the theory of the accumulator
is 

  lay off the theory please the listener interrupted
i understand perfectly without it energy is stored in
the accumulators-you put it in and take it out thats
all that is necessary

td like to give you some of the theory-but after
-i all it wouldnt add much to your understanding of
the working of things and it might mix you up as
some of it is pretty deep stuff then too it would take
a lot of time and the rest of your friends would squawk
if i kept you here indefinitely from the accumulators
then the power is fed to the converters each of which
is backed by a projector the converters simply
change the aspect of the rays from the energy aspect to


amazing stories

the material aspect as soon as this is done the highly-
charged particles-or whatever they are-thus formed
are repelled by the terrific stationary force maintained
in the projector backing the converter each particle
departs with a velocity supposed to be that of light and
the recoil upon the projector drives the vessel or car
or whatever it is attached to still with me

  struggling a little but my nose is still above the
surface these particles being so infinitesimally small
that they cannot even be detected go right through any
substance without any effect-they are not even harm-
ful

  exactly now we are in position to go ahead with
the lights detectors and so on the energy aspect of
the rays you can best understand as simply a vibration
in the ether-an extremely high frequency one while
not rigidly scientific that is close enough for you and
me nobody knows what the stuff really is and it can-
not be explained or demonstrated by any model or con-
cept in three-dimensional space its physical-mathe-
matical interpretation the only way in which it can be
grasped at all requires sixteen co-ordinates in four di-
mensions and i dont suppose youd care to go into
that

  pll say i wouldnt she exclaimed feelingly

  well anyway by the use of suitable fields of force
it can be used as a carrier wave most of this stuff of
the fields of force-how to carry the modulation up and
down through all the frequency changes necessary-was
figured out by the martians ages ago used as a pure
carrier wave with a sender and a receiver at each end it
isnt so bad-thats why our communicator and radio
systems work as well as they do they are pretty good
really but the ultra-light vision system is something else
again sending the heterodyned wave through steel is
easy but breaking it up so as to view an object and re-
turn the impulses was an awful job and one that isnt
half done yet we see things after a fashion and at
a distance of a few kilometers by sending an almost
parallet wave from a twin-projector to disintegrate and
double back the viewing wave thats the way the
lookout plates and lenses work all over the ship-from
the master-screens in the control room to the plates of
the staterooms and lifeboats and the viewing-areas of
the promenades but the whole system is a rotten make-
shift and 

  just a minute exclaimed the girl i and every-
body else have been thinking that everything is abso-
lutely perfect and yet every single thing you have
talked about you have ended up by describing as un-
known rudimentary temporary or a makeshift
you speak as though the entire system were a poor thing
that will have to do until something better has been
found and that nobody knows anything about anything
how do you get that way

  by working with brandon and westfall those
birds have got real brains and theyre on the track of
something that will in - all probability be as far ahead
of roesers rays as our present system is ahead of the
science of the seventeenth century

  really she looked at him in astonishment tell
me about it

  cant be done he refused i dont know much
about it-even they didnt know any too much about
some of it when i had to come in and what little i
do know i cant tell because it isnt mine

  but youre working with them arent you

  yes in the sense that a small boy helps his father
build a house theyre the brains-i simply do some
figuring that they dont want to waste time doing
nadia having no belief whatever in his modest dis-
claimer but in secret greatly pleased by his attitude re-
plied 

  of course you couldnt say anything about an un-
finished project-i shouldnt have asked where do we
go from here

  down the lining of the hull outside the passengers
quarters to the upper dirigible projectors and he led
the way down a series of steep steel stairways through
bulkheads and partitions of steel one thing i forgot
to tell you about-the detectors theyre worked on the
same principle as the lights and are just about as effi-
cient instead of light though they send out cones of
electro-magnetic waves which set up induced currents
in any conductor encountered beyond our own shell
since all dangerous meteorites have been shown to con-
tain conducting material that is enough to locate them
for radio finders automatically determine the direction
distance and magnitude of the disturbance and swing
a light on it that was what happened when that light
swung toward us back there in the prow

  are there any of those life-boats that ive heard
discussed so much lately near here asked the girl

  lots of em-heres one right here and at the next
landing he opened a vacuum-insulated steel door
snapped on a light and waved his hand you cant
see much of it from here but its a complete space-ship
in itself capable of maintaining a dozen or fifteen per-
sons during a two-weeks cruise in space

  why isnt it a good idea to retain them accidents
are still possible are they not

  of course and there is no question of doing away
with them entirely modern ships however have only
enough of them to take care of the largest number of
persons ever to be carried by the vessel

  has the arcturus more than she needs

  ill say she has and more of everything else except
room for pay-load

  ive heard them talking about junking her i think
its a shame

  so do i in a way-you see i helped design her and
her sister-ship the sirius which brandon and westfall
are using as a floating laboratory but times change
and the inefficient must go shes a good old tub but
she was built when everybody was afraid of space and
we had to put every safety factor into her that we could
think of as a result she is four times as heavy as she
should be and that takes a lot of extra power her
skin is too thick she has too many batteries of ac-
cumulators too many lif e-boats too many bulkheads and
air-breaks too many and too much of everything she
is so built that if she should break up out in space no-
body would die if they lived through the shock-there
are so many bulkheads air-breaks and life-boats that no
matter how many pieces she broke up into the sur-
vivors would find themselves in something able to navi-
gate that excessive construction is no longer neces-
sary modern ships carry ten times the pay-load on
one-quarter of the power that this old battle-wagon uses
even though shes only four years old shes a relic of
the days when we used to slam through on the ecliptic
route right through all the meteoric stuff that is always
spacehounds of ipg



there-trusting to heavy armor to ward off anything too
small for the observers and detectors to locate now
with the observatories and check-stations out in space
fairly light armor is sufficient as we route ourselves
well away from the ecliptic and so miss all the heavy
stuff so badly as i hate to see her go there the old
tub is bound for the junk-yard

a few more flights of stairs brought them to the
upper band of dirigible projectors which encircled
the hull outside the passengers quarters some sixty feet
belowt the prow they were heavy search-light-like
affairs mounted upon massive universal bearings free
to turn in any direction and each having its converter
nestling inside its prodigious field of force stevens ex-
plained that these projectors were used in turning the
vessel and in dodging meteorites when necessary and
they went on through another almost invisible door into
a hall and took an elevator down to the main corridor

  well youve seen it miss newton stevens said
regretfully as he led her toward the captains office
the lower half is full of heavy stuff-accumulators
machinery driving projectors and such junk so that
the center of gravity is below the center of action of
the driving projectors that makes stable flight possible
its all more or less like what weve just seen and i
dont suppose you want to miss the dance-anyway a lot
of people want to dance with you

  wouldnt you just as soon show me through the lower
half as dance

  rather lots

  so would i i can dance any time and i want to
see everything lets go

  down they went past battery after battery of ac-
cumulators  climbing over and around the ever-in-
creasing number of huge steel girders and bracers
through mazes of heavily insulated wiring and conduits
past mass after mass of automatic machinery which
stevens explained to his eager listener they inspected
one of the great driving projectors which built rigidly
parallel to the axis of the ship and held immovably in
place by enormous trusses of steel revealed neither to
the eye nor to the ear any sign of the terrific force it
was exerting still lower they went until the girl had
been shown everything even down to the bottom ultra-
lights and stern braces

  tired stevens asked as the inspection was com-
pleted

  not very its been quite a climb but ive had a
wonderful time

  so have i he declared positively i know what
-well crawl up into one of these stern lifeboats and
make us a cup of coffee before we clynb back with
me

   way ahead of you nadia accepted the invitation
enthusiastically and they made their way to the nearest
of the miniature space-cruisers here although no
emergency had been encountered in all the four years of
the vessels life they found everything in readiness and
the two soon had prepared and eaten a hearty luncheon

  well i cant think of any more excuses for monopo-
lizing you miss newton so i suppose ill have to take
you back believe me ive enjoyed this more than you
can realize-ive 

  he broke off and listened every nerve taut what
was that he exclaimed

  what was what i didnt hear anything

  something screwy somewhere i felt a vibration
and anything thatd make this mountain of steel even
quiver must have given us one gosh-awful nudge
theres another

  the girl painfully tense felt only a barely perceptible
tremor but the computer knowing far better than she
the inconceivable strength and mass of that enormous
structure of solidly braced hardened steel sprang into
action leaping to the small dirigible look-out plate he
turned on the power and swung it upward

reat suffering snakes he ejaculated then stood
vj mute for the plate revealed a terrible sight the
entire nose of the gigantic craft had been sheared off in
two immense slices as though clipped off by a gigantic
sword and even as they stared fascinated at the sight
the severed slices were drifting slowly away swinging
the view along the plane of cleavage stevens made out a
relatively tiny ball of metal only fifty feet or so in di-
ameter at a distance of perhaps a mile from this ball
there shot a blinding plane of light and the arcturus fell
apart at the midsection the lower half separating clean
from the upper portion which held the passengers
leaving the upper half intact the attacker began slicing
the lower driving half into thin disk-shaped sections
as that incandescent plane of destruction made its first
flashing cut through the body of the arcturus accom-
panied by an additional pyrotechnic display of severed
and short-circuited high-tension leads stevens and nadia
suddenly found themselves floating weightless in the air
of the room still gripping the controls of the look-out
plate stevens caught the white-faced girl with one
hand drew her down beside him and held her motionless
while his keen mind flashed over all the possibilities of
the situation and planned his course of action

  theyre apparently slicing us pretty evenly and by
the looks of things one cut is coming right about here
he explained rapidly as he found a flashlight and drew
his companion through the door and along a narrow
passage soon he opened another door and led her
into a tiny compartment so low that they could not stand
upright-a mere cubicle of steel carefully closing the
door he fingered dials upon each of the walls of the
cell then folded himself up into a comfortable position
instructed nadia to do the samer and snapped off the
light

  please leave it on the shaken girl asked its so
ghastly

  wed better save it nadia he advised pressing her
arm reassuringly its the only light weve got and
we may need it worse later on-its life is limited you
know

  later on do you think well need anything-later
on

  sure of course they may get us nadia but this
little tertiary air-break is a mighty small target for them
to hit and if they miss us as i think they will theres
a larger room opening off each wall of this one-at least
one of which will certainly be left intact from any one
of those rooms we can reach a life-boat of course its
a little too much to expect that any one of the life-boats
will be left whole but theyre bulkheaded too you know
so that we can be sure of finding something able to
navigate-providing we can make our get-away be-
lieve me ace im sure glad were aboard the old


amazing stories

arcturus right now with all her safety-devices instead
of on one of the modern liners wed be sunk right

  i felt sunk enough for a minute-fm feeling better
now though since you are taking it so calmly

  sure-why not a mans not dead until his heart
stops beating you know-our turnll come next when
they let up a little

  but suppose they change the width of their slices
and hit this cubby small as it is

  its be just too bad he shrugged in that case
wed never know what hit us so its no good worrying
about it but say we might do something at that if
they didnt hit us square i can move fairly fast and
might be able to get a door open before the loss of pres-
sure seals it well light the flash    here you hold
it so that i can have both hands free put both arms
around me just under the arms and stick to me like a
porous plaster because if i have to move at all ill have
to jump like chain lightning shine the beam right over
there so itll reflect and light up all the dials at once
there    hold on tight here they come

  as he spoke a jarring shudder shook one side of their
hiding-place then a moment later the phenomenon was
repeated but with much less force upon the other side
stevens sighed with relief took the light and extin-
guished it

  missed us clean he exulted now if they dont
find us were all set

  how can they possibly find us i seem to be al-
ways worried about the wrong things but i should
think that their finding us would be the least of our
troubles

  dont judge their vision system by ours-theyve got
everything apparently however their apparatus may
not be delicate enough to spot us in a space this small
when their projectors flash through it as they probably
will then too theres a couple of other big items in
our favor-nobody else is in the entire lower half since
all this machinery down here is either automatic or else
controlled from up above so they wont be expecting to
see anybody when they get down this far and we arent
at all conspicuous were both dressed in gray-your
clothes in particular are almost exactly the color of this
armor-plate-so altogether we stand a good chance of
being missed

  what shall we do now

  nothing whatever-wish we could sleep for a couple
of hours but of course theres no hope of that stretch
out here like that-you cant rest folded up like an
accordion-and ill lie down diagonally across the room
theres just room for me that way thats one ad-
vantage of weightlessness-you can lie down standing
on your head and go to sleep and like it but i forgot
-youve never been weightless before have you does
it make you sick

  not so much now except that i feel awfully weird
inside i was horribly dizzy and nauseated at first but
its going away

t hats gooci-it makes lots of people pretty sick

  x in fact some folks get awfully sick and cant
seem to get used to it at all its the canals in the inner
ear that do most of it you know however if youre as
well as that already youll be a regular spacehound in
half an hour ive been weightless for weeks at a
stretch out in the sirius and now ive got so i really like

it here wed better keep in touch he found her
hand and tucked it under his arm stabilize our posi-
tions more besides keeping us from getting too lonesome
here in the dark he concluded in a matter-of-fact
voice

  thanks for saying us-but you would wouldnt
you and a wave of admiration went through her for
the real and chivalrous manhood of the man with whom
she had been forced by circumstances to cast her lot
how long must we stay here 

  as long as the air lasts and id like to stay here
longer than that we dont want to move around any
more than we absolutely have to until their rays are of
of us and we have no way of knowing how long that
will be also wed better keep still i dont know
what kind of an audio system theyve got but theres
no use taking unnecessary chances

  all x-im an oysters little sister and for many
minutes the two remained motionless and silent now
and then nadia twitched and started at some vague real
or imaginary sound-now and then her fingers tightened
upon his biceps-and he pressed her hand with his
great arm in reassurance and understanding once a
wall of their cell resounded under the impact of a fierce
blow and stevens instantly threw his arm around the
girl twisting himself between her and the threatened
wall ready for any emergency but nothing more hap-
pened  the door remained closed the cell stayed bottle-
tight and time wore slowly on all too soon the unmis-
takeable symptoms of breathing an unfit atmosphere
made themselves apparent and stevens after testing each
of the doors drew the girl into a larger room where
they breathed deeply of the fresh cool air

  how did you know that this room was whole
asked nadia we might have stepped out into space
mightnt we

  no if this room had lost its tightness the door
wouldnt have opened they wont open if theres a
difference of one kilogram pressure on the two sides
thats how i knew that the room we were in at first
was cut in two-the door into that air-break wouldnt
move

  what comes next

  i dont know exactly what to do-wed better hold
a little council of war they may have gone 
stevens broke off as the structure began to move and
they settled down upon what had been one of the side-
walls greater and greater became the acceleration un-
til their apparent weight was almost as much as it would
have been upon the earth at which point it became
constant    but they havent he continued the in-
terrupted sentence this seems to be a capture and
seizure as well as an attack so well have to take the
risk of looking at them besides its getting cold in
here one or two of the adjoining cells have apparently
been ruptured and were radiating our heat out into
space so well have to get into a life-boat or freeze ill
go pick out the best one wonder if id better take you
with me or hide you and come back after you 

  dont worry about that-im coming with you
nadia declared positively

  just as well probably he asssnted and they set out
a thorough exploration of all the tight connecting cells
revealed that not a lifeboat within their reach remained
intact but that habitable and navigable portions of three
such craft were available selecting the most completely
spacehounds of ipc



equipped of these they took up their residence therein
by entering it and closing the massive insulating door
stevens disconnected all the lights save one and so
shielded that one before turning it on that it merely
lightened the utter darkness into a semi-permeable
gloom he then stepped up to the lookout plate and
with his hand upon the control pondered long the pos-
sible consequences of what he wished to do

  what harm would it do to take just a little peek

  i dont know-thats the dickens of it maybe none
and then again maybe a lot you see we dont know
who or what we are up against the only thing we
know is that theyve got us beat a hundred ways and
weve got to act accordingly weve got to chance it
sometime though if we can ever get away so we might
as well do it now ill put it on very short range first
and see what we can see by the small number of cells
weve got here im afraid theyve split us up lengthwise
too-so that instead of having a whole slice of the old
watermelon to live in weve got only about a sixth of one
-shaped about like a piece of restaurant pie one
thing i can do though ill turn on the communicator
receiver and put it on full coverage-maybe we can hear
something useful

  putting a little power upon the visiray plate he moved
the point of projection a short distance from their hid-
ing-place so that the plate showed a view of the wreck-
age the upper half of the vessel was still intact the
lower half a jumble of sharply-cut fragments from
each of the larger pieces a brilliant ray of tangible force
stretched outward suddenly their receiver sounded be-
hind them as the high-powered transmitter in the tele-
graph room tried to notify headquarters of their plight
areturns attacked and cut up being taken tow  
rapidly as the message wras uttered the transmitter
died with a rattle in the middle of a word and nadia
looked at stevens with foreboding in her eyes

  theyve got something thats one thing sure to be
able to neutralize our communicator beams that way
he admitted not so good-well have to play this
close to our vests girl

  are you just trying to cheer me up  do you really
think we have a chance she demanded i want to
know just where we stand

  im coming clean with you no kidding if we can
get away well be all x because ill bet a farm that by
this time brandons got everything those birds have and
maybe more they beat us to it thats all im kind of
afraid though that getting away isnt going to be quite
as simple as shooting fish down a well

far ahead of them a port opened a lifeboat shot out
at its full power and again their receiver tried to
burst into sound but it was a vain attempt the sound
died before one complete word could be uttered and
the lifeboat its power completely neutralized by the rays
of the tiny craft of the enemy floated gently back to-
ward the mass of its parent and accompanied it in its
headlong flight several more lifeboats made the at-
tempt as the courageous officers of the arcturus some
of whom had apparently succeeded in eluding the vigil-
ance of the captors launched the little shells from vari-
ous ports but as each boat issued its power was neutral-
ized and it found itself dragged helplessly along in the
grip of one of those mysterious brilliant rays of force
at least one hidden officer must have been watching the

fruitless efforts for the next lifeboat to issue made 
attempt either to talk or to flee but from it there flamed
out into space a concentrated beam of destruction-the
terrible ray of annihilation against which no known sub-
stance could endure for a moment the ray which had
definitely outlawed war but even that frightful weapon
was useless-it spent its force harmlessly upon an im-
palable invisible barrier a hundred yards from its
source and the bold lifeboat disappeared in one blinding
explosion of incandescence as the captor showed its real
power in retaliation stevens jaw hard-set leaped from
the screen then brought himself up so quickly that he
skated across the smooth steel floor shutting off the
lookout plate he led the half-fainting girl across the
room to a comfortable seat and sat down beside her-
raging but thoughtful nadia soon recovered

  why are you acting so contrary to your nature-is it
because of w she demanded a dozen times ive
seen you start to do something and then change your
mind i will not be a load on you nor hinder you in
anything you want to do

  i told your father id look after you and im going
to do it he replied indirectly i would do it anyway
of course-even if you are ten or twelve years older
than i thought you were

  yes dad never has realized that im more than eight
years old i see-you were going out there and be
slaughtered  he flushed but made no reply in that
case im glad im here-that would have been silly i
think wed better hold that council of war you mentioned
awhile ago dont you

  i need a smoke-do you indulge

  no thanks i tried it a few times at school but never
liked it

  he searched his pockets bringing to light an unopened
package and a battered remnant which proved to contain
one dilapidated cigarette he studied it thoughtfully ill
smoke this wreck he decided while its still smokable
well save the rest of them-im afraid itll be a long
time between smokes well lets confer

  this will have to be a one-sided conference i dont
imagine that any of my ideas will prove particularly help-
ful you talk and ill listen

  you cant tell what ideas may be useful-chip in any
time you feel the urge heres the dope as i see it
theyre highly intelligent creatures and are in ail prob-
ability neither martians nor venerians if any of them
had any such stuff as that some of us would have known
about it and besides i dont believe they would have used
it in just that way mercury is not habitable at least for
organic beings and we have never seen any sign of any
other kind of inhabitants who could work with metals
and rays theyre probably from jupiter although pos-
sibly from further away i say jupiter because i would
think judging from the small size of the ship that it
may still be in the experimental stage so that they prob-
ably didnt come from any further away than jupiter
then too if they were very numerous somebody would
have sighted one before id give my left leg and four
fingers for one good look at the inside of that ship
why didnt you take it then you never even looked
toward it after that one first glimpse

  ill say i didnt-the reason being that they may have
automatic detectors and as i have suggested before our
system of vision is so crude that its use could be detected
with a clothesline or a basket full of scrap iron but to


amazing stories

resume their aim is to capture not destroy since they
havent killed anybody except the one crew that attacked
them apparently they want to study us or something
however they dont intend that any of us shall get away
nor even send out a word of what has happened to us
therefore it looks as though our best bet is to hide now
and try to sneak away on them after a while-direct
methods wont work right

  you sound lucid is there any possibility of getting
back though if we got anywhere near jupiter its so
far away

  its a long stretch from jupiter to any of the planets
where we have power-plants all right-particularly now
when mars and tellus are subtending an angle of some-
thing more than ninety degrees at the sun and venus is
between the two while jupiter is clear across the sun
from all three of them even when jupiter is in mean
opposition to mars it is still some five hundred and
fifty million kilometers away so you can form some idea
as to how far it is from our nearest planet now no if
we expect to get back under our own power weve got
to break away pretty quick-these lifeboats have very
little accumulator capacity and the receptors are useless
above about three hundred million kilometers   

  but itll take us a long time to go that far wont it

  not very our own ships using only the acceleration
of gravity and both plus and minus at that make the
better than four hundred million kilometers of the long
route to mars in five days these birds are using almost
that much acceleration and i dont see how they do it
they must have a tractor ray brandon claimed that
such a thing was theoretically possible but westfall and
i couldnt see it we ragged him about it a lot-and he
was right i thought of course theyd drift with us
but they are using power steadily theyve got some
system

  suppose they could be using intra-atomic energy
we were taught that it was impossible but youve shat-
tered a lot of my knowledge today

  i wouldnt want to say definitely that it is absolutely
impossible but the deeper we go into that line the more
unlikely intra-atomic energy power-plants become no
theyve got a real power-transmission system-one that
can hold a tight beam together a lot farther than anything
we have been able to develop thats all well weve
given them quite a lot of time to get over any suspicion
of us lets see if we can sneak away from them

by short and infrequent applications of power to the
dirigible projectors of the life-boat stevens slowly
shifted the position of the fragment which bore their
craft until it was well clear of the other components of
the mass of wreckage he then exerted a very small
retarding force so that their bit would lag behind the
procession as though it had accidently been separated
but the crew of the captor was alert and no sooner
did a clear space show itself between them and the mass
thaq a ray picked them up and herded them back into
place stevens then nudged other pieces so that they
fell out only to see them also rounded up hour after
hour he kept trying-doing nothing sufficiently energetic
to create any suspicion but attempting everything he
could think of that offered any chance of escape from the
clutches of their captors immovable at the plate his
hands upon the controls he performed every insidious
maneuver his agile brain could devise but he could not

succeed in separating their vehicle from its fellows
finally after a last attempt which was foiled as easily
as were its predecessors he shut off his controls and
turned to his companion with a grin

   i didnt think i could get away with it-theyre keen
that gang-but i had to keep at it as long as it would
have done us any good

  wouldnt it do us any good now

   not a bit-were going so fast that we couldnt stop
-were out of even radio range of our closest power-
plant well have to put off any more attempts until they
slow us down theyre fairly close to at least one of the
moons of jupiter well have our best chance-so good in
fact that i really think we can make it

  but what good would that do us if we couldnt get
back dire foreboding showed in her glorious eyes

   lots of things not tried yet girl and well try them
all first we get away second we try to get in touch
with norman brandon   

  how no known radio will carry half that far
no but i think that a radio as yet unknown may be
able to-and there is a bare possibility that ill be able to
communicate

  oh wonderful-that lifts a frightful load off my
mind she breathed

  but just a minute-i said id come clean with you
and i will the odds are all against us no matter what we
do if that unknown radio wont work-and it probably
wont-there are several other things we can try but
theyre all pretty slim chances even if we get away
itll probably be about the same thing as though you were
to be marooned on a desert island without any tools
and with your rescue depending upon your ability to
build a high-powered radio station with which to call to a
mainland for help however-if we dont try to get away
our only alternative is letting them know were here and
joining our friends in captivity

  and then what 

  you know as much as i do imprisonment and re-
straint certain death possible return to earth almost
certainly impossible-life as guests highly improbable
im with you steve all the way

   well its time to spring off-wreve both been awake
better than fifty hours personally im all in and youre
so near dead that youre a physical wreck well get us
a bite of supper and turn in

  an appetizing supper was prepared from the abundant
stores and each ate a heartier meal than either would have
believed possible stevens considered his unopened
package of cigarettes then regretfully put it back into
his pocket still unopened and turned to nadia

   well little fellow its time to shove off and then
some you might as well sleep here and  go in there
if anything scares you yell good-night old trapper
wait a minute steve nadia flushed and her brown
eyes and black eyebrows in comparison with her golden-
blond hair lent her face a quizzical elfin expression that
far belied her feelings as she stared straight into his
eyes ive never even been away from the earth before
and with all this happening im simply scared to death
ive been trying to hide it but i couldnt stand it alone
and were going to be together too long and too close for
senseless conventions to affect us theres two bunks
over there-why dont you sleep in one of them

  he returned her steadfast gaze for a moment in
silence
spacehounds of ipc



  all x with me nadia he answered keeping out of
his voice all signs of the tenderness he felt for her and
of his very real admiration for her straightforward con-
duct in a terrifying situation you trust me then

  trust you dont be silly-i know you i know
you and i know brandon and westfall-i know what
youve done and exactly the kind of men you are trust
you

  thanks old golf-shootist and promises were made
and received in a clasp from which nadias right hand
strong as it was emerged slightly damaged

  by the way what is your first name fellow-travel-
ler she asked in lighter vein nobody not even dad
or breckie ever seems to call you anything but steve
when they talk about you she was amazed at the effect
of her innocent question for stevens flushed to his hair
and spluttered

  its percy v he finally snorted percival van
schravendyck stevens wouldnt that tear it

  why i think percivals a real nice name

  silence he hissed in burlesque style young wo-
man i have revealed to you a secret known to but few
living creatures on your life keep it inviolate

  oh very well if you insist good-night-steve
and she gave him a radiant and honest smile the first
smile he had seen since the moment of the attack

chapter iii
castaways upon ganymede

upon awakening the mans first care was to in-
struct the girl in the operation of the projectors
so that she could keep the heavily-armored edge
of their small section which she had promptly christened
the forlorn hope between them and the grinding
clashing mass of wreckage and thus if it should become
necessary protect the relatively frail inner portions of
their craft from damage

  keep an eye oh things for a while nadia he in-
structed as soon as she could handle the controls and
dont use any more power than is absolutely necessary
well need it all and besides they can probably detect
anything we can use theres probably enough leakage
from the ruptured accumulator cells to mask quite a
little emission but dont use much im going to see
what i can do about making this whole wedge navigable
why not just launch whats left of this lifeboat its
space-worthy isnt it

  yes but its too small two or three of the big di-
rigible projectors of the lower band are on the rim of
this piece-of-pie-shaped section were riding i think if
so and if enough batteries of accumulators are left in-
tact to give them anywhere nearly full power we can
get an acceleration that will make a lifeboat look sick
those main dirigibles you know are able to swing the
whole mass of the arcturus and what theyll do to this
one chunk of it-weve got only a few thousand tons of
mass in this piece-will be something pretty also hav-
ing the metal may save us months of time in mining it
he found the projectors repaired or cut out the dam-
aged accumulator cells and reconnected them through the
controls of the lifeboat he moved into the engine-
room the airtanks stores and equipment from all the
other fragments which by means of a space-suit he
could reach without too much difficulty from the bat-

tery rooms of those fragments-open shelves after being
sliced open by the shearing ray-he helped himself to
banks of accumulator cells from the enormous driving
batteries of the ill-fated arcturus bolting them down
and connecting them solidly until almost every compart-
ment of their craft was one mass of stored-up energy

  days fled like hours so furiously busy were they in
preparing their peculiar vessel for a cruise of indefinite
duration stevens cut himself short on sleep and
snatched his meals in passing and nadia when not
busy at her own tasks of observing housekeeping and
doing what little piloting was required was rapidly
learning to wield most effectively the spanner and pliers
of the mechanic and electrician

  im afraid our time is getting short steve she an-
nounced after making an observation it looks as
though we re getting wherever it is were going

well ive got only two more jobs to do but theyre
the hardest of the lot it is jupiter or can you tell yet
jupiter or one of its satellites i think from the point
where they reversed their power heres the observa-
tion you told me to take

  looks like jupiter he agreed after he had rapidly
checked her figures well pass very close to one of
those two satellites-probably ganymede-which is fine
for our scheme all four of the major satellites have
water and atmosphere but ganymede being largest is
best for our purposes weve got a couple of days yet
-just about time to finish up lets get going-you
know what to do

  steve im afraid of it its too dangerous-isnt
there some other way

  none that i can see the close watch theyre keep-
ing on every bit of this junk makes it our only chance
for a get-away im pretty sure i can do it-but if
i should happen to get nipped just use enough power
to let them know youre here and you wont be any
worse off than if i hadnt tried to pull off this stunt
he donned a space-suit filled a looped belt with
tools picked up a portable power-drill and stepped into
the tiny air-lock nadia deftly guided their segment
against one of the larger fragments and held it there with
a gentle steady pressure while stevens a light cable
paying out behind him clambered carefully over the
wreckage brought his drill into play and disappeared in-
side the huge wedge in less than an hour he returned
without mishap and reported to the glowing girl

  just like shooting fish down a well most of the ac-
cumulator cells were tight and installing the relays
wasnt a bad job at all believe me girl therell be
junk filling ail the space between here and saturn when
we touch them off

  wonderful steve nadia exclaimed it wont be
so bad seeing you go into the others now that you have
this one all rigged up

around and around the mass of wreckage they
crept and in each of the larger sections stevens
connected up the enormous fixed or dirigible projectors
to whatever accumulator cells were available through
sensitive relays all of which he could close by means of
one radio impulse the long and dangerous task done
he stood at the lookout plate studying the huge disk
which had been the upper portion of the lower half of
the arcturus and frowning in thought nadia reached
over his shoulder and switched off the plate


amazing stories

  nix on that second job big fellow she declared
they arent really necessary and youre altogether too
apt to be killed trying to get them its too ghastly-i
wont stand for your trying it so that ends it

  we ought to have them really he protested with
those special tools cutting torches and all the stuff
wed be sitting pretty well lose weeks of time by not
having them

  well just have to lose it then you cant get em
any more than a baby can get the moon so stop crying
about it she went over the familiar argument for the
twentieth time that stuff up there is all grinding to-
gether like cakes of ice in a floe the particular section
you want is in plain sight of whoever is on watch and
those tools and things are altogether too heavy to handle
youre a husky brute i know but even you couldnt be-
gin to handle them even if you had good going i
couldnt help you very much even if youd let me try
and the fact that you so positively refuse to let me come
along shows how dangerous you know the attempt is
bound to be youd probably never even get up there
alive to say nothing of getting back here no steve
thats out like a light

  i sure wish theyd left us weightless for a while
sometime if only for an hour or two he mourned

  but they didnt she retorted practically so were
just out of luck to that extent our time is about up
too its time you worked us back to the tail end of this
procession-or rather the head end since were travel-
ing down now

  stevens took the controls and slowly worked along
the outer edge of the mass down toward its extremity
nadia put one hand upon his shoulder and he glanced
around

  thanks steve we have a perfectly wonderful
chance as it is and weve gone so far with our scheme
together that it would be a crying shame not to be able
to go through with it id hate like sin to have to surren-
der to them now and thats all i could do if anything
should become of you besides    her voice died
away into silence

  sure youre right he hastily replied dodging the
implication of that unfinished sentence i couldnt
figure out anything that looked particularly feasible
anyway-thats why i didnt try it well pass it up
soon they arrived at their objective and maintained
a position well in the van but not sufficiently far ahead
of the rest to call forth a restraining ray from their
captors already strongly affected by the gravitational
pull of the mass of the satellite many of the smaller por-
tions of the wreck not directly held by the tractors be-
gan to separate from the main mass as each bit left its
place another beam leaped out until it became apparent
that no more were available and stevens strapped the
girl and himself down before two lookout plates

  now for it nadia he exclaimed and simultane-
ously threw on the power of his own projectors and sent
out the radio impulse which closed the relays he had so
carefully set they were thrown against the restraining
straps savagely and held there by an enormous weight
as the gigantic dirigible projectors shot their fragment
of the wreck away from the comparatively slight force
which had been acting upon it but they braced them-
selves and strained their muscles in order to watch what
was happening as the relays in the various fragments
closed the massed power of the accumulators was

shorted dead across the converters and projectors in-
stead of being fed into them gradually through the con-
trols of the pilot with a result comparable to that of the
explosion of an ammunition dump most of the masses
whose projectors were fed by comparatively few accu-
mulator cells darted away entirely with a stupendous ac-
celeration a few of them however received the un-
impeded flow of complete batteries those projectors
tore loose from even their massive supports and crashed
through anything opposing them like a huge armor-
piercing projectile it was a spectacle to stagger the
imagination and stevens grinned as he turned to the
girl who was staring in wide-eyed amazement

  well ace i think theyre busy enough now so that
itll be safe to take that long-wanted look at their con-
trols and he flashed the twin beams of his look-
out light out beyond the upper half of the a retu-
rns-only to see them stop abruptly in mid-space even
the extremely short carrier-wave of roesers rays could
not go through the invisible barrier thrown out by the
tiny but powerful globe of space

  no penetration nadia asked

  flattened them out cold however as the fox once
remarked about the grapes til bet theyre sour any-
way well have some stuff of our own one of these
days i sure hope the fireworks we started back there
keep those bird amused until we get out of sight be-
cause if i use much more power on these projectors we
may not have juice enough left to stop with

  youre using enough now to suit me-im so heavy
i can hardly lift a finger

  youd better lift em you must watch whats going-
on back there while i navigate around this moon

  all x chief    theyve got their hands full ap-
parently those rays are shooting around all over the
sky it looks as though they were trying to capture four
or five things at once with each one

  good tell me when the moon cuts them off

at the awful acceleration they were using which con-
stantly increased the terrific velocity with which
they had been traveling when they made good their es-
cape it was not long until they had placed the satellite
between them and the enemy then stevens cut down and
reversed his power such was their speed however
that a long detour was necessary in order to reduce
it to a safe landing rate as soon as this could be done
stevens headed for the morning zone and dropped the
hope rapidly toward the surface of that new strange
world details could not be distinguished at first be-
cause of an all-enshrouding layer of cloud but the ris-
ing sun dispelled the mist and when they had descended
to within a few thousand feet of the surface their vision
was unobstructed immediately below them the terrain
was mountainous and heavily wooded while far to the
east the rays of a small pale sun glinted upon a vast
body of water no signs of habitation were visible
as far as the eye could reach

  now to pick out a location for our power-plant we
must have a waterfall for power a good place to hide our
ship from observation and id like to have a little seam
of coal we can use wood if we have to but i think
we can find some coal this is all sedimentary rock-
it looks a lot like the country along the north fork of
the flathead in montana there are a lot of coal out-
crops usually in such topography as this is
spacehounds of ipc



  we want to hide in a hurry though dont we
not particularly i think if they had missed us at
all they would have had us long ago and with all the
damage we did with those projectors they wont be sur-
prised at one piece being missing-i imagine they lost
a good many

  but theyll know that somebody caused all that dis-
turbance wont they hunt for us

  maybe and maybe not-no telling what theyll do
however by the time they can land and get checked
up and ready to hunt for us well be a mighty small
needle well hidden in a good big haystack

  for several hours they roamed over the mountainous
region at high velocity seeking the best possible loca-
tion and finally they found one that was almost ideal-
a narrow canyon overhung with heavy trees opening into
a wide deep gorge upon a level with its floor a mighty
waterfall cascaded into the gorge just above the canyon
and here and there could be seen black outcrops which
stevens after a close scrutiny declared to be coal he
deftly guided their cumbersome wedge of steel into the
retreat allowed it to settle gently to the ground and shut
off the power

  well little fellow-conspirator against the peace and
dignity of the jovians i dont know just where we are
but wherever it is were here we got away clean and
as long as we dont use any high-tension stuff or any-
thing else that they can trace i think were as safe as
money in a bank

  i suppose that i ought to be scared to death steve
but im not-im just too thrilled for words nadia
answered and the eager sparkle in her eyes bore out her
words can we go out now how about air shall
we wear suits or go out as we are have you got a
weapon of any kind hurry up-lets do something
pipe down ace remember that we dont know any
more about anything around here than a pig does about
sunday and conduct yourself accordingly take it easy
im surprised at the gravity here this is certainly gany-
mede and it has a diameter of only about fifty seven
hundred kilometers if i remember correctly
damoiseau estimated its mass at about three one-
hundredths that of the earth which would make its
surface gravity about one-sixth however it is actually
almost a half as you see by this spring-balance here
therefore it is quite a little more massive than has
been   

  what of it lets go places and do things

  calm yourself ginger youve got lots of time-
well be here for quite a while im afraid we cant go
out until we analyze the air-were sure lucky theres
as much as there is im not exactly the worlds fore-
most chemist but fortunately an air-analysis isnt much
of a job with the apparatus we carry

  while nadia controlled her impatience as best she
could stevens manipulated the bulbs and pipettes of the
gas apparatus

  pressure fifty-two centimeters-more than i dared
hope for-and analysis all x i believe oxygen concen-
tration a little high but not much

  we wont have to wear the space-suits then

  not unless i missed something in the analysis the
pressure corresponds to our own at a height of about
three thousand meters which we can get used to without
too much trouble good thing too i brought along all
the air i could get hold of but as i told you back there

if we had to depend  it altogether we might be out of
luck im going to pump some of our air back into a
cylinder to equalize our pressure-dont want to waste
any of it until were sure the outside air suits us with-
out treatment

when the pressure inside had been gradually re-
duced to that outside and they had become ac-
customed to breathing the rarefied medium stevens
opened the airlock and the outside doors and for some
time cautiously sniffed the atmosphere of the satellite
he could detect nothing harmful or unusual in it-it was
apparently the same as earthly air-and he became jubi-
lant

  all x nadia-luck is perched right on our banner
freedom air water power and coal now as you
suggested well go places and do things

  suppose its safe her first eagerness to explore
their surroundings had abated noticeably you arent
armed are you

  no and i dont believe that there was a gun of any
kind aboard the arcturus that kind of thing went out
quite a while ago you know well take a look anyway
-weve got to find out about that coal before we decide
to settle down here remember this half-gravity stuff
and control your leg-muscles accordingly

  leaping lightly to the ground they saw that the sev-
ered section of fifty-inch armor which was the rim of
their conveyance almost blocked the entrance to the nar-
row canyon which they had selected for their retreat
upon one side that wall of steel actually touched the al-
most perpendicular wall or rock upon the other side there
was left only a narrow passage they stepped through
it so that they could see the waterfall and the gorge
and stopped silent the sun now fairly high was in
 sense the familiar orb of day but was a pale insipid
thing only one-fifth the diameter of the sun to which
they were accustomed and which could almost be studied
with the unshielded eye from their feet a grassy
meadow a few hundred feet wide sloped gently down
to the river from whose farther bank a precipice sprang
upward for perhaps a thousand feet-merging into
towering hills whose rugged grandeur was reminiscent
of the topography of the moon at their backs the wall
of the gorge was steep but not precipitous and was
covered with shrubs and trees-some of which leaned
out over the little canyon completely screening it and
among whose branches birds could now and then be seen
flitting about in that direction no mountains were visi-
ble indicating that upon their side of the river there was
an upland plateau or bench to their right the river
the gorge and the strip of meadow extended for a
mile or more then curved away and were lost to sight
to their left almost too close for comfort was the stu-
pendous cataract towering above them to a terror-in-
spiring height nadia studied it with awe which
changed to puzzled wonder

  whats the matter with it steve it looks like a
picture in slow motion like the kind they take of your
dives-or am i seeing things

  no its really slow compared to what were used to
remember that one-half gravity stuff

  oh thats right but it certainly does look funny it
gives me the creeps

  youll get used to it pretty quick-just as youll get
used to all the rest of the things having only half their


amazing stories

earthly weight and falling only half as fast as they ought
to when you drop them well i dont see anything that
looks dangerous yet-lets go up toward the falls a few
meters and prospect that outcrop

  with a few brisk strokes of an improvised shovel he
cleared the outcrop of detritus and broke off several
samples of the black substance with which they went
back to the forlorn hope

  its real coal stevens announced after a series of
tests ive seen better but on the other hand theres
lots worse itll make good gas and a kind of a coke
not so hot but itll do now wed better get organized
old partner for a long camgaign 

  go ahead and organize-im only the cheap help in
this enterprise

  cheap help youre apt to be the life of the party
can you make and shoot a bow and arrow 

  ill say i can-ive belonged to an archery club for
five years

  what did i tell you youre a life saver heres
the dope-weve got to save our own supplies as much as
possible until we know exactly what were up against
and to do that weve got to live off the country ill fake
up something to knock over some of those birds and
small game then we can make real bow-strings and
feathered arrows and ill forge some steel arrowheads
while youre making yourself a real bow wed better
make me about a hundred-pound war bow too 

  a hundred interrupted nadia thats a lot of
bow big boy-think you can bend it

  youd be surprised he grinned im not quite
like robin hood-ive been known to miss a finger-
thick wand at a hundred paces-but im not exactly a
beginner

  oh of course-i should have known by your lan-
guage that youre an archer otherwise youd never have
used such an old-fashioned word as pounds i shoot
a thirty-five-pound bow ordinarily but for game i should
have the heaviest one i can hold accurately-about a
forty-five probably

  all x and as soon as i can ill make us a couple
of suits of fairly heavy steel armor so that weh have
real protection if we should need it you see we dont
know what we are apt to run up against out here then
with that much done itll be up to you to provide since
ill have to work tooth and nail at the forges youll
have to bring home the bacon do the cooking and so on
and see what you can find along the line of edible roots
grains fruits and what-not sort of reverse the indian
idea-you be the hunter and ill keep the home fires
burning can do

  what it takes to do that ive got nadia assured
him her eyes sparkling have you your job planned
out as well and as fittingly as you have mine

  and then some weve got just two methods of
getting away from here-one is to get in touch with
brandon so that hell come after us the other is to re-
charge our accumulators and try to make it under our
own power either course will need power and lots of
it  

  i never thought of going back in the hope sup-
pose we could

  about as doubtful as the radio-i think that i could
build a pair of matched-frequency auto-dirigible trans-
mitter and receptor units such as are necessary for
space-ships fed by stationary power-plants but after i

got them built theyd take us less than half way there
then wed have only what power we can carry and i
hate even to think of what probably would happen to us
wed certainly have to drift for months before we
could get close enough to any of our plants to radio for
help and wed be taking awful chances you see wed
have to take a very peculiar orbit and if we should miss
connections passing the inner planets what the sun
would do to us at the closest point and where whats
left of us would go on the back-swing would be just too
bad beides if we can get hold of the sirius theyll
come loaded for bear and we may be able to do some-
thing about the rest of the folks out here

uh breathed the girl wouldnt it be wonderful
if we could i thought of course theyd all
be  her voice died away

  not necessarily-theres always a chance thats
why im trying the ultra-radio first however either
course will take lots of power so the first thing ive
got to do is to build a power plant im going to run
a penstock up those falls and put in a turbine driving
a high-tension alternator then while im trying to
build the ultra-radio ill be charging our accumulators
so that no time will be lost in case the radio fails if
it does fail-and remember im not counting on its work-
ing-of course ill tackle the transmission and receptor
units before we start out to drift it

  you say it easy steve but how can you build all
those things with nothing to work with

  its going to be a real job-ill not try to kid you
into thinking itll be either easy or quick heres the
way everything will go before i can even lay the first
length of the penstock ive got to have the pipe-to
make which ive got to have flat steel-to get which ill
have to cut some of the partitions out of this ship of ours
-to do which ill have to have a cutting torch-to make
which ill have to forge nozzles out of block metal and
to run which ill have to have gas-to get which ill
have to mine coal and build a gas-plant-to do
which 

  good heavens steve are you going back to the stone
age i never thought of half those things why its
impossible

  not quite guy things could be a lot worse-thats
why i brought along the whole forlorn hope instead
of just the lifeboat as it is weve got several thousand
tons of spare steel and lots of copper weve got ordi-
nary tools and a few light motors blowers and such
stuff that gives me a great big start-i wont have
to mine the ores and smelt the metals as would have
been necessary otherwise however itll be plenty bad
ill have to start out in a pretty crude fashion and for
some of the stuff ill need ill have to make not only the
machine that makes the part i want but also the machine
that makes the machine that makes the machine that
makes it-and so on just how far down the line i
havent dared to think

  you must be a regular jack-of-all-trades to think
you can get away with such a program as that 

  i am-nothing else but you see while most of my
school training was in advanced physics and mathe-
matics i worked my way through by computing and de-
signing and ive done a lot of truck-horse labor of
various kinds besides i can calculate and design al-
most anything and i can make a pretty good stab at
spacehounds of ipc



translating a design into fabricated material i wouldnt
wonder if brandons ultra-radio would stop me since
nobody had even started to build one when i saw him
last-but i helped compute it know the forces involved
as well as he did at that time and it so happens that i
know more about the design of coils and fields of force
than i do about anything else so i may be able to work
it out eventually it isnt going to be not knowing how
that will hold me up-itll be the lack of something that
i cant build

  and thats where you will go back and back and back
as you said about building the penstock

  back and back is right if i can find all the necessary
raw materials-thats whats probably going to put a
lot of monkey-wrenches into the machinery and
stevens went to work upon a weapon of offense fash-
ioning a crude but powerful bow from a strip of spring
steel strung with heavy wire

  how about arrows shall i go see if i can hit a
bird with a rock for feathers and see if i can find some-
thing to make arrows out of

  not yet-anyway id bet on the birds im going
to use pieces of this light brace-rod off the accumulator
cells for arrows they wont fly true of course but
with their mass i can give them enough projectile force
to kill any small animal they hit no matter how they
hit it

  after many misses he finally bagged a small animal
something like a rabbit and something like a kangaroo
and a couple of round-bodied plump birds almost as
large as domestic hens these they dressed with con-
siderable distaste and a noticeable lack of skill

  well get used to it pretty quick diana-also more
expert he said when the task was done we now
have raw material for bowstrings and clothes as well
as food

  the word raw being heavily accented nadia de-
clared with a grimace but how do we know that
theyre good to eat

  well have to eat em and see he grinned i dont
imagine that any flesh is really poisonous and well
have to arrive at the ones we like best by a process of
trial and error well heres your job-ill get busy
on mine dont go more than a few hundred meters away
and yell if you get into a jam

  theres a couple of questions i want to ask you
what makes it so warm here when the suns so far away
and jupiter isnt supposed to be radiating any heat
and how about time its twelve hours by my watch
since sunrise this morning and its still shining

  as for heat ive been wondering about that it must
be due to internal heat because even though jupiter may
be warm or even hot it certainly isnt radiating much
since it has a temperature of minus two hundred at the
visible surface which of course is the top of the atmos-
phere our heat here is probably caused by radioac-
tivity-thats the most modern dope i believe as for
time it looks as though our days were something better
than thirty hours long instead of twenty-four of
course ill keep the chronometer going  i-p time
since well probably need it in working out observations
but we might as well let our watches run down and work
eat and sleep by the sun-not much sense in trying to
keep tellurian time here as i see it check

  all x ill have supper ready for you at sunset
bye

  a few evenings later when stevens came in after his
long days work he was surprised to see nadia dressed
in a suit of brown coveralls and high-laced moccasins
how do i look she asked pirouetting gayly
neat but not gaudy he approved thats good
mole-skin-smooth soft and tough whered you make
the raise i didnt know we had anything like that on
board what did you do for thread you look like a
million dollars-you sure did a good job of fitting

  i had to have something-what with all the thorns
and brush there wtas almost more of me exposed than
covered and i was getting scratched up something fierce
so i ripped up one of the space-suits and found out that
theres enough cloth fur and leather in one of them to
make six ordinary suits and thread by the kilometer i
was awfully glad to see all that thread-i had an idea
that id have to unravel my stockings or something but
i didnt your clothes are getting pretty tacky too and
youre getting all burned with those hot coals and things
im going to build you a suit out of leather for your
blacksmithing activities

  fine business ace then we can save whats left
of our civilized clothes for the return trip what do we
eat

  the eternal question of the hungry laboring man
ive got a roasted bongo a fried filamaloo bird and a
boiled warple for the meat dishes for vegetables
mashed hikoderms and pimola greens neocorn bread
translate that please into terms of food
translate it yourself after you eat it i changed
the system on you today ive named all the things
so itll be easier to keep track of those we like and the
ones wre dont

  with appetites sharp-set by long hours of hard labor
they ate heartily then in the deepening twilight they
sat and talked in comradely fashion while stevens
smoked one precious cigarette

it was not long until nadia had her work well in hand
game was plentiful and the fertile valley and the
neighboring upland yielded peculiar but savory vege-
table foods in variety and abundance so that soon she
was able to spend some time with stevens helping him
as much as she could thus she came to realize the true
magnitude of the task he faced and the real seriousness
of their position

  as stevens had admitted before the work was started
he had known that he had set himself a gigantic task
but he had not permitted himself to follow step by step
the difficulties that he knew awaited him now as the
days stretched into weeks and on into months he was
forced to take every laborious step and it was borne in
upon him just how nearly impossible that herculean
labor was to prove-just how dependent any given
earthly activity is upon a vast number of others here
he was alone-everything he needed must be manufac-
tured by his own hands from its original sources he
had known that progress would be slow and he had been
prepared for that but he had not pictured even to him-
self half of the maddening setbacks which occurred time
after time because of the crudity of the tools and equip-
ment he was forced to use all too often a machine or
part the product of many hours of grueling labor would
fail because of the lack of some insignificant thing-some
item so common as to be taken for granted in all terres-
trial shops but impossible of fabrication with the means


amazing stories

at his disposal at such times he would set his grim jaw
a trifle harder go back one step farther toward the stone
age and begin all over again-to find the necessary raw
material or a possible substitute and then to build the ap-
paratus and machinery necessary to produce the part he
required thus the heart-breaking task progressed and
nadia watched her co-laborer become leaner and harder
and more desperate day by day unable in any way to
lighten his fearful load

  in the brief period of rest following a noonday meal
stevens lay prone upon the warm fragrant grass be-
side the forlorn hope but it was evident to nadia
that he was not resting his burned and blistered hands
were locked savagely behind his head his eyes were
closed too tightly and every tense line of his body was
eloquent of a strain even more mental than physical
she studied him for minutes her fine eyes clouded then
sat down beside him and put her hand upon his shoul-
der

  i want to talk to you a minute steve she said
gently

  all x little fellow-but it might be just as well if
you didnt touch me you see fm getting so rabid that
i cant trust myself

  thats exactly what i want to talk to you about
a fiery blush burned through her deep tan but her low
clear voice did not falter and her eyes held his unflinch-
ingly iknow you better than you know yourself as
ive said before you are killing yourself but it isnt
the work frightfully hard and disheartening as it is
that is doing it-its your anxiety for me and the un-
certainty of everything you havent been able to rest
because you have been raging and fuming so at un-
avoidable conditions-you have been fighting facts and
its all so useless steve between you and me-every-
thing would check out on zero if wed just come out into
the open

  the mans gaunt frame seemed to stiffen even more
rigidily

  youve said altogether too much or else only half
enough nadia you know of course that ive loved
you ever since i got really to know you-and that didnt
take long you know that i love you and you know how
i love you-with the real love that a man can feel for
only one woman and only once in his life and you know
exactly what were up against now that does tear it-
wide open he finished bitterly

   no it doesnt at all she replied steadily of course
i know that you love me and i glory in it and since
you dont seem to realize that i love you in exactly the
same way ill tell you so love you good heavens
steve i never dreamed that such a man as you are really
existed but youre fighting too many things at once
and theyre killing you and theyre mostly imaginary
at that cant you see that theres no need of uncertainty
between you and me that there is no need of you
driving yourself to desperation on my account what-
ever must be is all x with me steve if you can build
everything you need all well and good well be en-
gaged until then and our love will be open and sweet
if worst comes to worst so that we can neither com-
municate with brandon and westfall nor leave here
under our own power-even that is nothing to kill our-
selves about and yes i do know exactly what we are
facing i have been prepared for it ever since i first
saw what a perfectly impossible thing you are attempting

you are trying to go from almost the age of bronze
clear up to year-after-next in a month or two not one
man in a million could have done as much in his lifetime
as you have done in the last few weeks and i do not
see how even you with what little you have to work
with can possibly build such things as power-plants
transmitters and ultra-radio stations but what of it
for the day that it becomes clear that we are to remain
here indefinitely that day we will marry each other here
before god look around at this beautiful country
could there be a finer world upon which to found a
new race when we decided to cut loose from the
arcturus i told you that i was with you all the way and
now ill repeat it with a lot more meaning no matter
what its like steve no matter where it leads to im
with you-to-the-end-of-the-road here or upon
earth or anywhere in the universe i am yours for life
and for eternity

while she was speaking the grim strained lines
upon stevens face had disappeared and as she
fell silent he straightened up and gently tenderly rever-
ently he took her lithe body into his arms

  youre right sweetheart-everything will check out
on zero to nineteen decimals he was a man trans-
figured ive been fighting windmills and ive been
scared sick-but how wras i to think that a wonder-girl
like you could ever love a mutt like me you certainly
are the gamest little partner a man ever had youre the
worlds straightest shooter ace-youre a square brick if
there ever was one your sheer nerve in being willing
to go the whole route makes me love you more than
ever if such a thing can be possible and it certainly
puts a new face on the whole cock-eyed universe for
me flowever i dont believe it will come to that after
what youve just said i sure will lick that job regardless
of how many different factories it takes to make one
armature-ill show that mess of scrap-iron what kind
of trees make shingles

  the girl still in his arms he rose to his feet and re-
leased her slowly reluctantly unwilling ever to let her
go then he shook himself as though an overwhelming
burden had been lifted from his shoulders and laughed
happily

  see this cigaretfe he went on lightly the last
of the mohicans im going to smoke it in honor of our
engagement he drew the fragrant smoke deep into his
lungs and frowned at her in mock seriousness

  this would be a nice wrorld to live on of course but
the jobs here are too darn steady it also seems to be
somewhat lacking in modern conveniences such as steel-
mills and machine tools then too it is just a trifle too
far from the royal and ancient for you really to enjoy
living here permanently and besides i cant get my
favorite brand of cigarettes around here therefore
after due deliberation i dont believe well take the
place-well go back to tellus kiss me just once more
ace and ill- make that job think a cyclone has struck
it right on the center of impact like samuel weller
or whoever it was im clear full of wigor wim and
witality

  the specified kiss and several others duly delivered he
strode blithely away and the little canyon resounded
writh the blows of his heavy sledge as he attacked with
renewed spirit the great forging white-hot from his
soak-pit which was to become the shaft of his turbo-al-

supremely happy sigh

chapter iv
ganymedean life

slow hard and disheartening as the work had
been at first stevens had never slackened his pace
and after a time as his facilities increased the ex-
asperating setbacks decreased in number and severity
and his progress became faster and faster large as the
forlorn hope was space was soon at a premium for
their peculiarly-shaped craft became a veritable fac-
tory housing a variety of machinery and equipment un-
known in any single earthly industrial plant nothing
was ornamental-everything was stripped to its barest
fundamental necessities-but every working part func-
tioned with a smooth precision to delight the senses of
any good mechanic

  in a cavern under the falls was the great turbine to
be full-fed by the crude but tight penstock which clung
to the wall of the gorge angling up to the brink of that
stupendous cataract bedded down upon solid rock
there was a high-tension alternator capable of absorb-
ing the entire output of the mighty turbine this turbo-
alternator was connected to a set of converters from
which the energy would flow along three great copper
cables-the receptors of the lifeboats being altogether
too small to carry the load-to the now completely ex-
hausted accumulators of the forlorn hope all
high-tension apparatus was shielded and grounded so
that no stray impulses could reveal to the possible de-
tectors of the jovians the presence of this foreign power
plant housings frames spiders all stationary parts
were rough crude and massive but bearings shafts
armatures all moving parts were of a polished and
finished accuracy and balance that promised months and
years of trouble-free operation everything ready for
the test stevens took off his frayed and torn leather
coveralls and moccasins and climbed nimbly up the pen-
stock he never walked down opening the head-gate
he poised sharply upon its extremity and took off in
a perfect swan-dive  floating unconcernedly down toward
that boiling maelstrom two hundred feet below he
struck the water with a sharp smooth slup and raced
ashore seizing his suit as he ran toward the turbo-
alternator it was running smoothly and knowing that
everything was tight at the receiving end he lingered
about the power plant until he was assured that nothing
would go wrong and that his home manufactured lubri-
cating oil and grease would keep those massive bearings
cool

  hunger assailed him and glancing at the sun he noted
that it was well past dinner-time

  wow he exclaimed aloud the boss just loves to
wait meals-shell burn me up for this

  he ran lightly toward home eager to tell his sweet-
heart that the long awaited moment had arrived-that
power was now flowing into their accumulators

  hi diana of the silver bowr he called how come
you no blow the dinner bell powers on-come give it
a look

  there was no answer to his hail and stevens paused

in shocked amazement he knew that never of her own
volition would she be out so late-nadia was gone a
rapid tour of inspection quickly confirmed that which
he already knew only too well forgotten was his
hunger forgotten the power plant forgotten everything
except the fact that his nadia the bouyant spirit in
whom centered his universe was lost or  he could
not complete the thought even to himself

  swiftly he came to a decision and threw off his suit
revealing the body of a hercules-a body ready for any
demand he could put upon it always in hard training
months of grinding physical labor and of heavy eating
had built him up to a point at which he would scarcely
have recognized himself could he have glanced into a
mirror mighty but pliable muscles writhed and swelled
under his clear skin as he darted here and there selecting
equipment for what lay ahead of him he donned the
heavily armored space-suit which they had prepared
months before while they were still suspicious of pos-
sible attack it was covered with heavy steel at every
point and the lenses of the helmet already of unbreak-
able glass had been re-enforced with thick steel bars
tank and valves supplied air at normal pressure so that
his powerful body could function at full efficiency not
handicapped by the lighter atmosphere of ganymede
the sleeves terminated in steel-protected rubber wrist-
lets which left his hands free yet sheltered from attack
-wristlets tight enough to maintain the difference in
pressure yet not tight enough to cut off the circulation
he took up his mighty war-bow and the full quiver of
heavy arrows-full-feathered and pointed with savagely
barbed tearing heads of forged steel-and slipped into
their sheaths the long and heavy razor-sharp sword and
the double-edged dirk which he had made and ground
long since for he knew not what emergency and whose
bell-shaped hilts of steel further protected his hands and
wrists thus equipped he had approximately his nor-
mal earthly weight a fact which would operate to his
advantage rather than otherwise in case of passible
combat with one last look around the forlorn hope
whose every fitting spoke to him of the beloved mistress
who was gone he filled a container with water and
cooked food and opened the door

tt wont be long now now it wont be long naida
-a- caroled happily buckling on her pack straps and
taking up bow and arrowrs for her daily hunt i never
thought that he could do it but what it takes to do things
hes got lots of she continued to improvise the song as
she left the hope with its multitudinous devices whose
very variety was a never-failing delight to her showing
as it did the sheer ability of the man whose brain and
hands had almost finished a next-to-impossible task

 through the canyon and up a well-worn trail she
climbed and soon came out upon the sparsely timbered
bench that wtas her hunting grounds upon this day
however she was full of happy anticipation and her
mind was everywhere except upon her work she was
thinking of stevens of their love of the power which he
might turn on that very day and of the possible rescue
for which she had hitherto scarcely dared to hope thus
it was that she walked miles beyond her usual limits
without having loosed an arrow and she was surprised
when she glanced up at the sun to see that half the morn-
ing was gone and that she was almost to the foothills
beyond which rose a towering range of mountains


amazing stories

  snap out of it girl she reprimanded herself go
on wool-gathering like this and your man will go hungry
-and hell break you right off at the ankles she be-
came again the huntress and soon saw an animal brows-
ing steadily along the base of a hill it was a six-legged
deer-like creature much larger than anything she had as
yet seen but it was meat and her time was short there-
fore she crept within range and loosed an arrow with the
full power of her hunting bow unfamiliar as she was
with the anatomy of the peculiar creature the arrow did
not kill the hexaped as she instantly named it sped
away and she leaped after it she like her companion
had developed amazingly in musculature and few indeed
were the denizens of ganymede who could equal her
speed upon that small globe with its feeble gravitational
force

  up the foothills it darted beyond the hills and
deep into a valley between two towering peaks the chase
continued before nadias third arrow brought the ani-
mal down bending over the game she became con-
scious of a strange but wonderful sweet perfume and
glanced up to see something which she certainly had not
noticed when the hexaped had fallen it was an en-
ormous flower at least a foot in diameter and indescrib-
ably beautiful in its crimson and golden splendor al-
most level with her head the gorgeous blossom waved
upon its heavy stem based by a massive cluster of en-
ormous smooth dark green leaves entranced by this
unexpected and marvelous floral display nadia breathed
deeply of the inviting fragrance-and collapsed sense-
less upon the ground thereupon the weird plant moved
over toward her and the thick leaves began to enfold her
knees this carnivorous thing however did not like the
heavy cloth of her suit and turned to the hexaped it
thrust several of its leaves into the wounds upon the
carcass and fed while two other leaves rasped together
sending out a piercing call

  in answer to the sound the underbrush crackled and
through it and upon the scene there crashed a vegetable-
animal nightmare-the parent of the relatively tiny thing
whose perfume had disabled the girl

  its huge and gorgeous blossom was supported by a
long flexible writhing stem and its base was composed
of many and highly specialized leaves there were saws
and spears and mighty but sinuous tendrils there were
slender shoots which seemed to possess some sense of
perception there was the massive tractor base composed
of extensible leaves which by their contraction and ex-
pansion propelled the mass along the ground parent
and child fell upon the hexaped and soon bones and
hair were all that remained the slender shoots then
wandered about the unconscious girl in her strange
covering and as a couple of powerful tendrils coiled
about her and raised her into the air over the monstrous
base of the thing its rudimentary brain could almost be
perceived working as it sluggishly realized that now full
fed it should carry this other victim along to feed its
other offspring when they should return to its side

barely outside the door of the forlorn hope
stevens whirled about with a bitter imprecation
he had already lost time needlessly-with a lookout
plate he could cover more ground in ten minutes than he
could cover afoot in a week he flipped on the power
and shot the violet beam out over the pleateau to the
district where he knew nadia was wont to hunt not

finding her there he swung the beam in an ever widen-
ing circle around that district finally he saw a few
freshly broken twigs and scanned the scene with care
he soon found the trail of fresh blood which marked
the path of the flight of the hexaped and with the pecu-
liar maneuverability of the device he was using it was
not long until he was studying the scene where the en-
counter had taken place he gasped when he saw the
bones and perceived three of nadias arrows but soon
saw that the skeleton was not human and was reassured
casting about in every direction he found nadias bow
and saw a peculiar freshly trampled path leading from
the kill past the bow down the valley he could not
understand the spoor but it was easily followed and he
shot the beam along it at headlong speed until he came
up with the monstrous creature that was making it-
until he saw what burden that organism was carrying

  he leaped to the controls of the lifeboat then dropped
his hand while the stream of power now flowing was
ample to operate the lookout plates yet it would be many
hours before the accumulator cells would be in condition
to drive the craft even that short distance

  itll take over an hour to get there-heres hoping

i	can check in all x he muttered savagely as he took
careful note of the location and direction of the crea-
tures trail and set off at a fast jog-trot

  the carnivorous flowers first warning that all was not
well was received when stevens steel-shod feet landed
squarely upon its base and one sweeping cut of his sword
loppd off the malignant blossom and severed the two
tendrils that still held the unconscious nadia with a
quick heave of his shoulder he-tossed her lightly back-
ward into the smooth-beaten track the creature had made
and tried to leap away-but the instant he had consumed
in rescuing the girl had been enough for the thing to
seize him and he found himself battling for his very
life no soft-leaved infant this but a full-grown
monster well equipped with mighty weapons of offense
and defense well it was for the struggling man that
he was encased in armor steel as those saw-edged hard-
spiked leaves drove against him with crushing force
well it was for him that he had his own independent air
supply so that that deadly perfume eddied ineffective
about his helmeted head hard and fiercely driven as
those terrible thorns were they could do no more than
dent his heavy armor his powerful left arm driving
the double-razor-edged dirk in short resistless arcs
managed to keep the snaky tendrils from coiling about
his right arm which was wielding the heavy trenchant
sword every time that mighty blade descended it
cleaved its length through snapping spikes and impo-
tently grinding leaves but more than once a flairling ten-
dril coiled about his neck armor and held his helmet im-
movable as though in a vise while those frightful grind-
ingsaws sought to rip their way through the glass to the
living creature inside the peculiar metal housing dirk
and saber and magnificent physique finally triumphed
but it was not until each leaf was literally severed from
every other leaf that the outlandish organism gave up
the ghost

nadia had been tossed out into pure air beyond
the zone of the stupefying perfume and she re-
covered her senses in time to see the finish of the bat-
tle stevens assured that his foe was hors du combat
turned toward the spot where he had thrown nadias

body he saw that she was unharmed and sprang
toward her in relief he was surprised beyond mea-
sure however to see her run away at a pace he could
not hope to equal encumbered as he was motioning
frantically at him the while to keep away from her he
stopped astounded and started to unscrew his helmet
whereupon she dashed back toward him signaling him
emphatically to leave his armor exactly as it was he
stood still and stared at her an exasperated question
large upon his face until she made clear to him that he
was to follow her at a safe distance then she set off at
a rapid walk she led him back to where the hexaped
had fallen where she retrieved her bow and arrows
then keeping a sharp lookout upon all sides she went
on to a small stream of water she made the dumb-
founded man go out into the middle of the creek and
lie down and roll over in the water approaching him
sniffing cautiously between immersions she made him
continue the bathing until she could detect not even the
slightest trace of the sweet but noxious fragrance of that
peculiarly terrible form of ganymedean life only then
did she allow him to remove his helmet so that she
could give him the greeting for which they both had
longed and tell him what it was all about

  so thats it ace he exclaimed still holding her
tightly in his iron embrace great balls of fire i
thought maybe you were still a little cuckoo anaesthetic
perfume huh  hot stuff id say-no wonder you bit
--i would too its lucky for us i was air-tight-wed
both be fee  

  stop it she interrupted him sharply forget it-
dont ever even think of it

  all x ace its out like the well known light what
to do its getting darker than a hat and were a long
way from home dont know whether i could find my
way back in the dark or not and just between you and
me im not particularly keen on night travel in these
parts after whats just happened are you

  anything else but she assured him fervently
id lots rather stay hungry until tomorrow

  no need of that-ive brought along enough supper
for both of us im hungry as a wolf too now that i
have time to think of it well eat and den up some-
where-or climb a tree those wampuses probably cant
climb trees

  theres a nice little cave back there about a hun-
dred meters well pretend its the ritz and they
soon had a merry fire blazing in front of the retreat
there they ate of the provisions stevens had brought
then while the man rolled up boulders before the nar-
row entrance of the cave nadia gathered leaves and
made a soft bed upon its warm dry floor

  good night lover and the girl untroubled and se-
cure now that stevens was at her side was almost in-
stantly asleep but the man was not sleepy he thought
of the power plant even now sending its terrific stream
of energy into his accumulators he thought of the
ultra-radio-where could he get all the materials needed 
he thought of his friends wondering whether or not
they would receive his message he thought of breck-
enridge and the other human beings who had been aboard
the arcturus wondering poignantly as to their fate he
thought of newton and of his own people who had
certainly given them up for dead long since

  but above all he thought of the beautiful steel-true
companion lying there asleep at his mailed feet and he

gazed down at her his heart in his eyes the firelight
shone through the chinks between the boulders casting
a flickering ruddy light throughout the little cavern
nadia lay there her head pillowed upon one strong
brown little hand her lips were red and sweetly curved
her cheek was smooth and firm as so much brown vel-
vet she was literally aglow with sheer beauty and
with perfect health and the man reflected as he studied
her hungrily that this wild life certainly had agreed
with her-she was becoming more surpassingly beau-
tiful with every passing day

  you little trump-you wonderful lovely square lit-
tle brick he breathed silently and bent over to touch
her cheek lightly with his lips slight as the caress was
it disturbed her and even in her sleep her subconscious
mind sent out an exploring hand to touch her steve and
thus be reassured he pressed her hand and she settled
back comfortably with a long deep breath and he
stretched his iron-clad length beside her and closed his
eyes firmly resolved not to waste a minute of this won-
derful night in sleep

  when he opened them an instant later it was broad
daylight the boulders had been rolled away the fra-
grance of roasting meat permeated the atmosphere and
nadia was making a deafening clamor beating his
steel breastplate lustily with the flat of his huge saber

  daylight in the swamp you sleeper she exclaimed
roll out or roll up come and get it before i throw
it away

  i must have been kind of tired he said sheepishly
when he saw that she had shot a bird and had cooked
breakfast for them both while he had been buried in
oblivion

  peculiar too isnt it nadia asked pointedly you
only did about ten days work yesterday in ten minutes
swinging this frightful snickersnee of yours why you
played with it as though it were a knitting-needle and
when i wanted to wake you up with it i could hardly lift
it

  thought you didnt want that subject even men-
tioned  he tried to steer the talk away from his prowess
with the broadsword

  that was yesterday airily besides i dont mind
talking about you-its thinking about us being    you
know   that i cant stand

  all x ace i get you-right lets eat

breakfast over they started down the valley
stevens carrying his helmet under his arm hardly
had they started however than nadias keen eyes saw
a movement through the trees and she stopped and
pointed stevens looked once then hand in hand they
dashed back to their cave

  well pile up some of the boulders and you lie low
he instructed her as he screwed on his helmet she
snapped open his face-plate

  but what about you arent you coming in too
she demanded

  cant-theyd surround us and starve us out im
safe in this armor-thank heaven we made it as solid as
we did-and ill fight em in the open ill show em
what the bear did to the buckwheat

  all right i guess but i wish i had my armor too
she mourned as he snapped shut his plate and walled her
into the cave with the same great rocks he had used
the night before then nadia safe from attack he

drew his quiver of war-arrows into position over his
shoulder placed one at the ready on his bow-string
and turned to face the horde of things rushing up the
valley toward him wild animals he had supposed them
but as he stood firm and raised his weapon shrill
whistles sounded in the throng and he gasped as he re-
alized that those frightful creatures must be intelligent
beings for not only did they signal to each other but
he saw that they wrere armed with bows and arrows
spears and slings

  six-limbed creatures they were of a purplish-red
color with huge tricornigerous heads and with staring
green phosphorescent eyes two of the six limbs were
always legs two always arms the intermediate two
due to a mid-section jointing of the six-foot-long al-
most cylindrical body could be used at will as either
legs or arms now out of range as they supposed
they halted and gathered about one who was apparently
their leader some standing erect and waving four
hands while shaking their horns savagely in stevens
direction others trotting around  four legs busily
gathering stones of suitable size for their vicious slings

  too far away to use their own weapons and facing
only one small four-limbed creature they considered
their game already in the bag but they had no compre-
hension of earthly muscles nor any understanding of
the power and range of a hundred-pound bow driving a
steel-headed war arrow thus while they were arguing
stevens took the offensive and a cruelly barbed steel
war-head tore completely through the body of their
leader and mortally wounded the creature next beyond
him though surprised they were not to be frightened
off but with wild shrill screams rushed to the attack
stevens had no ammunition to waste and every time
that mighty bow twanged a yard-long arrow transfixed
at least one of the red horde-and a body through which
had torn one of those ghastly hand-forged arnyw-heads
was of very little use thereafter accurately-sped ar-
rows splintered harmlessly against the re-enforced win-
dows of his helmet and against the steel guards pro-
tecting his hands he was almost deafened by the din
as the stone missiles of the slingers rebounded from his
reverberating shell of steel but he fired carefully stead-
ily and powerfully until his last arrow had been loosed
then the wicked dirk in his left hand and the long and
heavy saber weaving a circular path of brilliance in the
sun he stepped forward a couple of paces to meet the
attackers for a few moments nothing could stand be-
fore that fiercely driven blade-severed heads limbs
and fragments of torsos literally filled the air but sheer
weight of numbers bore him down as he fell he saw
the whte shaft of one of nadias hunting-arrowrs flash
past his helmet and bury itself to the nock in the body of
one of the horde above him nadia knew that her ar-
rows could not harm her lover and through a chink be-
tween two boulders she was shooting into the thickest of
the mob speeding her light arrows with the full power
of her bow

  though down the savages soon discovered that stev-
ens was not out in such close quarters he could not
use his sword but the fourteen-inch blade of the dirk
needle-pointed as it was and with two razor-sharp ser-
rated cutting edges was itself no mean weapon and
time after time he drove it deep taking life at every
thrust four more red monsters threw themselves upon
the prostrate man but not sufficiently versed in armor

to seek out its joints their fierce short spear thrusts did
no damage presently four more corpses lay still and
stevens with his to them incredible earthly strength
was once more upon his feet in spite of their utmost ef-
forts to pinion his mighty limbs and was again swinging
his devastating weapon half their force lying upon the
field wiped out by a small but invincible and apparently
invulnerable being the remainder broke and ran pur-
sued by stevens to the point where the red monsters had
first halted he recovered his arrows and returned to
the cave opening his face-plate as he came

  all x sweetheart he asked rolling away the boul-
ders didnt get anything through to you did they
no they didnt even realize that i was taking part
in the battle i guess did they hurt you while they
had you down i was scared to death for a minute
no the old armor held one of them must have
gnawed on my ankle some between the greave and the
heel-plate but he couldnt quite get through sa darn
small opening there too-must have bent my foot way
around to get in at all have to tighten that joint up a
little i guess  ill bet ive got a black spot and blue
spot there the size of my hand-maybe its only the size
of yours though

  you wont die of that probably heavens steve
that cleaver of yours is a frightful thing in action sup-
pose its safe for us to go home

  absolutely-right now is the best chance well ever
have and something tells me that wed better make it
snappy theyll be back and next time they wont be
so easy to take

  all x then-hold me steve i cant stand the sight
of that-let alone wade through it im going to faint
or something sure

  as you were he snapped you arent going to
pass out now that its all over its a pretty ghastly
mess i know but shut your eyes and til carry you out
of sight

  arent we out of sight of that place yet she de-
manded after a time

  have been for quite a while he confessed but
youre sitting pretty arent you and you arent very
heavy-not here on ganymede anyway

ttt me down she commanded after that crack
a  wont play with you any more at all-ill pick up
my marbles and go home

  he released her and they hurried back toward their
waterfall keeping wary eyes sharp-set for danger in any
form animal or vegetable on the way back across the
foothills stevens shot another hexaped and upon the
plateau above the river nadia bagged several birds and
small animals but it was not until they were actually in
their own little canyon that their rapid pace slackened
and their vigilance relaxed

  after this ace we hunt together and we go back to
wearing armor while were hunting it scared me out
of a years growth when you checked up missing

  we sure do steve she concurred emphatically
im not going to get more than a meter away from you
from now on what do you suppose those horrible
things are

 which

  both

  those flowers arent like anything tellus ever saw
so we have  basis of comparison they may be a de-
spacehounds of ipc



velopment of a fly catching plant or they may be a link
between the animal and the vegetable kingdom how-
ever we dont intend to study em so lets forget em
those animals were undoubtedly intelligent beings they
probably are a race of savages of this satellite

  then the really civilized races are probably   

  not necessarily-there may well be different types
each struggling toward civilization they certainly are
on venus and they once were on mars

  why havent we see anything like that before in all
these months things have been so calm and peaceful
that we thought we had the whole world to ourselves
as far as danger or men were concerned

  we never saw them before because we never went
where they lived-you were a long ways from your
usual stamping-grounds you know that animal-vege-
table flower is probably a high-altitude organism living
in the mountains and never coming as low as we are
down here as for the savages-whatever thev are-

    o	j

they probably never come within five kilometers of the
falls many primitive peoples think that waterfalls are
inhabited by demons and maybe these folks are afflicted
the same way

  we dont know much about our new world yet do
we

  we sure dont-and im not particularly keen on
finding out much more about it until we get organized
for trouble either well here we are-just like getting
back home to see the hope isnt it

  it is home and will be until we get one of our own
on earth and after stevens had read his meters learn-
ing with satisfaction that the full current was still flow-
ing into the accumulators he began to cut up the meat

  now that youve got the power-plant running at
last what next asked nadia piling the cuts in the
freezer

  brandons ultra-radio comes next but its got more
angles to it than a cubists picture of a set of prisms
so many that i dont know where to begin there that
jobs done-lets sit down and ill talk at you awhile
maybe between us we can figure out where to start
ive got everything to build it lined up except for the
tube but thats got me stopped cold you see fields
of force are all right in most places but ive got to have
one tube and its got to have the hardest possible vacuum
that means a mercury-vapor super-pump mercury
is absolutely the only thing that will do the trick and
the mercury is one thing that is conspicuous by its ab-
sence in these parts so are tungsten for filaments
tantalum for plates and platinum for leads and i havent
found anything that i can use as a getter either-a
metal you know to flash inside the tube to clean up the
last traces of atmosphere in it

  i didnt suppose that such a simple thing as a radio
tube could hold you up after the perfectly unbelievable
things that you have done already-but i see now how
it could of course the tubes in our receiver over
there are too small

  yes they are only receiver and communicator tubes
and i need a high-power transmitting tube-a fifty-kilo-
watter at least id give my left leg to the knee joint
for one of those big water-cooled sixty-kilowatt ten-
nineteens right now-it would save us a lot of grief
maybe you could break up those tubes and use the
plates and so on

  i thought of that but it wont work-there isnt

half enough metal in the lot and the filaments in par-
ticular are so tiny that i couldnt possibly work them
over into a big one then too we havent got many
spare tubes and if i smash the ones were using i pur
our communicators out of business for good so that we
cant yell for help if we have to drift home-and i still
dont get any mercury

  do you mean to tell me theres no mercury on this
whole planet

  not exactly but i do mean that i havent been able
to find any and that its probably darned scarce and
since all the other metals i want worst are also very
dense and of high atomic weight theyre probably mighty
scarce here too why because were on a satellite
and no matter what hypthesis you accept for the origin
of satellites you come to the same conclusion-that
heavy metals are either absent or most awfully scarce
and buried deep down toward the center there are lots
of heavy metals in jupiter somewhere but we probably
couldnt find them jupiters atmosphere is one mass of
fog and we couldnt see since we havent got an infra-
red transformer i could build one in time but it would
take quite a while-and we couldnt work on jupiter
anyway because of its gravity and probably because of
its atmosphere and even if we could work there we
dont want to spend the rest of our lives prospecting
for mercury stevens fell silent brow wrinkled in
thought

  you mean dear that were   nadia broke off
the sentence unfinished

  gosh no theres lots of things not tried yet and
we can always set out to drift it i was thinking only
of building the tube and im trying to think    say
nadia what do you know about cantrells comet
not a thing except that i remember reading in the
newspapers that it was peculiar for something or other
but what has cantrells comet got to do with the high
cost of living-or with radio tubes have you gone
cuckoo all of a sudden

  youd be surprised stevens grinned at her puzzled
expression cantrells comet is one of jupiters comet
family and is peculiar in being the most massive one
known to science it was hardly known until after they
built those thousand-foot reflectors on the moon where
the seeing is always perfect but it has been studied a
lot since then its nucleus is small but extremely heavy
-it seems to have an average density of somewhere
around sixteen theres platinum and everything else
thats heavy there girl they ought to be there in such
quantity that even such a volunteer chemist as i am
could find them

tteavens steve a look of alarm flashed over

  ii	nadias face then disappeared as rapidly as it
had come into being but of course comets arent
really dangerous

  sure not a comets tail which so many people are
afraid of as being poison gas is almost a perfect vacuum
even at its thickest and wed have to wear space-suits
anyway and speaking of vacuum    whoopee we
dont need mercury any more than a goldfish needs a gas-
mask when we get mr tube done well take him out
into space leaving his mouth open and very shortly
hell be as empty as a flappers skull then well seal
him up flash him out come back here and start spilling
our troubles into brandons shell-like ear

dont you but how do we get out there where is this
cantrells comet

  i dont know exactly-theres one rub another is
that i havent even started the transmitter and receptor
units but weve got some field-generators here on board
that i can use so it wont be so bad and our comet is
in this part of the solar system somewhere fairly close
wish we had an ephemeris a couple of i-p solar charts
and a real telescope

  you cant do much without an ephemeris i should
think its a good thing you kept the chronometers go-
ing you know the i-p time day and dates anyway
ill have to do without some things thats all and
the man stared absently at the steel wall i remember
something about its orbit since it is one thing that all
i-p vessels have to steer clear of think i can figure it
dose enough so that well be able to find it in our little
telescope or even on our plate since well be out of this
atmosphere and it might not be a bad idea for us to
get away anyway im afraid of those folks on that
space-ship whoever they were and they must live
around here somewhere cantrells comet swings about
fifty million kilometers outside jupiters orbit at aphelion
-close enough for us to reach and yet probably too far
for them to find us easily by the time we get back
here they probably will have quit looking for us if
they look at all then too i expect these savages to fol-
low us up what say little ace-do we try it or do wre
stay here

  you know best steve as i said before im with
you from now on in whatever you think best to do i
know that you think it best to go out there therefore
so do i

  well he said finally id better get busy then
-theres a lot to do before we can start the radio
doesnt come next after all-the transmitter and re-
ceptor units come ahead of it they wont mean wasted
labor in any event since well have to have them in case
the radio fails youd better lay in a lot of supplies while
im working on that stuff but dont go out of sight and
yell like fury if you see anything wed both better
wear full armor every time- we go out-of-doors-unless
im all out of control we arent done with those savages
yet even though they may be afraid of the demons of
the falls i think theyll have at least one more try at us
while nadia brought in meat and vegetables and
stored them awray stevens attacked the problem of con-
structing the pair of tight-beam auto-dirigible trans-
mitter and receptor units which would connect his great
turbo-alternator to the accumulators of their craft
wherever it might be in space from the force-field
generators of the forlorn hope he selected the two
most suitable for his purpose tuned them to the exact
frequency he required and around them built a complex
system of condensers and coils

  day after day passed their larder was full the re-
ceptor wras finished and the beam transmitter was almost
ready to attach to the turbo-alternator before the calm
was broken

  steve nadia shrieked glancing idly into the com-
municator plate she had been perfunctorily surveying
the surrounding territory theyre coming thousands
of them theyre all over the bench up there and just
simply pouring down the hills and up the valley
wish theyd waited a few hours longer-wed have

been gone however were just about ready for them
he commented grimly as he stared over her shoulder into
the communicator plate well make a lot of those in-
dians wish that they had stayed at home with their
papooses

  have you got all those rays and things fixed up

  not as many as id like to have you see i dont
know the composition of the i-p ray since it is outlawed
to everybody except the police of course i could have
found out from brandon but never paid any attention to
it ive got some nice ultra-violet though and a short-
wave oscillatory thatll cook an elephant to a cinder in
about eight seconds well keep them amused no fool-
ing glad we had time to cover our open sides and it
looks as though that meteorite armor we put over the
projectors may be mighty useful too

  on and on the savages came massed in formations
showing some signs of rude discipline this time there
was neither shrieking nor yelling the weird creatures
advanced silently and methodically here and there were
massed groups of hundreds dragging behind them en-
gfiies which stevens studied with interest

 hm  m  m catapults he mused you
were right girl of my dreams-armor and bows and
arrows wouldnt help us much right now theyre going
to throw rocks at us thatll have both mass and momen-
tum with those things they can cave in our side-armor
and might even dent our roof when one of those pro-
jectiles hits we want to know where it aint thats all

  stevens cast off the heavily-insulated plug connecting
the power plant leads to his now almost fully charged
accumulators strapped himself and nadia into place at
the controls and waited staring into the plate catapult
after catapult was dragged to the lip of the little canyon
until six of them bore upon the target the huge
stranded springs of hair fiber and sinew were wound
up to the limit and enormous masses of rock were
toilsomely rolled upon the platforms each gunner
seized his trip and as the leader shrieked his signal the
six ponderous masses of metalliferous rock heaved into
the air as one but they did not strike their objective
for as the signal was given stevens shot power into his
projectors the forlorn hope leaped out of the
canyon and high into the air over the open meadow
just as the six great projectiles crashed into the ground
upon the spot which an instant before she had occupied

rudimentary discipline forgotten the horde
rushed down into the canyon and the valley in full
clamor of their barbaric urgings horns and arms tossed
fiercely savage noises rent the air and arrows splintered
harmlessly upon steel plate as the mystified and mad-
dened warriors upon the plain below gave vent to their
outraged feelings

  look nadia a whole gang of them are smelling
around that power plug pretty soon somebodys going
to touch a hot spot and when he does well cut loose on
the rest of them

  the huge insulating plug housing the ends of the
three great cables leading to the converters of the turbo-
alternator lay innocently upon the ground its three
yawning holes invitingly open to savage arms the
chief who had been inspecting the power-plant walked
along the triplex lead and joined his followers at its
terminus pointing with his horns he jabbered orders
and three red monsters one at each cable bent to lift the
spacehounds of ipc



plug while the leader himself thrust an arm into each
of the three contact holes there was a flash of sear-
ing flame and the reeking smoke of burning flesh-those
three arms had taken the terrific no-load voltage of the
three-phase converter system and the full power of the
alternator had been shorted directly to ground through
the comparatively small resistance of his body

  stevens had poised the forlorn hope edgewise in
mid-air so that the gleaming heavily armored parabolic
reflectors of his projectors mounted upon the leading
edge of the fortress covered the scene below as the
charred corpse of the savage chieftain dropped to the
ground it seemed to the six-limbed creatures that the
demons of the falls had indeed been annoyed beyond en-
durance by their intrusion for as if in response to the
flash of fire from the power plug that structure so
peculiarly and so stolidly hanging in the air came plung-
ing down toward them from it there reached down
twin fans of death and destruction one flaming and al-
most invisibly incandescent violet which tore at the
eyes and excruciatingly disintegrated brain and nervous
tissues the other dully glowing an equally invisible red
at the touch of which body temperature soared to lethal
heights and foliage burst cracklingly into spontaneous
flame

  in their massed hundreds the savages dropped where
they stood life rived away by the torturing ultra-violet
burned away by the blast of pure heat or consumed by
the conflagrations that raged instantly wherever that
-vide-sweeping fan encountered combustible material
in the face of power supernatural they lost all thought
of attack or of conquest and sought only and madly to

escape weapons were thrown away the catapults were
abandoned and every man for himself the mob fled in
wildest disorder each striving to put as much distance
as possible between himself and that place of dread
mystery the waterfall

  well i guess thatll hold em for a while stevens
dropped their craft back into its original quarters in the
canyon whether they ever believed before that this
falls was inhabited by devils or not they think so now
ill bet that it will be six hundred jovian years before
any of them ever come within a hundred kilometers of
it again im glad of it too because theyll let our
power plant alone now well lets get going-weve
got to make things hum for a while

  why all the rush you just said that we have
scared them away for good

  the savages yes but not those others weve just
turned loose enough radiation to affect detectors all over
the system and its up to us to get this beam projector
set up get away from here and get our power shut off
before they can trace us snap it up ace

  the transmitter unit was installed at the converters
the cable was torn out and having broken the last ma-
terial link between it and ganymede stevens hurled the
forlorn hope out into space using the highest acceler-
ation nadia could endure hour after hour the massive
wedge of steel bored outward away from jupiter
hour after hour stevens anxious eyes scanned his in-
struments  hour after hour hope mounted and relief
took the place of anxiety as the screens remained blank
throughout every inquiring thrust into the empty ether
but they knew they would have to keep sharp vigilance

  by p schuyler miller

                                     author of through the vibrations

      ilhe captivating principle of life for all we know may be nothing but an
      a energy form as light heat electricity or matter in other words-a dis-
      turbance in space or ether as such it may well be found combined with any
      other energy form-light as well as matter and with a resulting intelligence
      in the present story the vapor creatures represent life in the vapor state in mat-
      ter while the singing ones are life in the light form of energy-more plaus-
      ible if you consider that light may be matter to some other vibrational system
      of frequencies though the author calls this a parallel to through the vibra-
      tions this story is in its way complete in itself more than its predecessor
      however it is very reminiscent of merritt

foreword

the world knows now the tale of those two
intrepid scientists doctor alexander gregory
and his assistant young john stewart who
discovered the secret of the resonator where-
by matter or any other vibratory motion in
the ether may be raised or lowered in frequency at will
experimenting upon themselves they traveled to another
plane another universe coincident with our own and
there discovered the lost civilization of atlantis trans-
ported there by this same secret many thousands of years
ago they found atlantis destroyed ravished by a race
of vapor creatures without analogy in this world and in
a measure avenged the dead atlantides by laying waste
to their unnatural underworld deep in the heart of the
planet then with the spoil of the dead atlantis they
returned to earth

  but a month ago the laboratory of dr gregory at
schenectady was the scene of a remarkable occurrence
in the middle of the afternoon as stewart was at work
on some experiments with orichalcum the radioactive
alloy of atlantis there was a shattering of retorts and
he turned to find a strange man strangely clad lying un-
conscious on the floor having apparently fallen some ten
feet he recognized him instantly as an atlantide and
with the aid of dr gregory obtained his story

he was a scientist of atlantis from a city still extant

upon an unexplored part of the planet his ruler had
found the manuscript left in yzdral a city of atlantis
by dr gregory during the expedition twenty years be-
fore and atlantis was sending some of her best scien-
tists to earth in order to promote friendly and mutually
advantageous relations between the two worlds as has
dr gregory this ruler cleon has feared the conse-
quences of unlimited commerce between the worlds at
present and only a limited number of men from both
worlds have since made the trip dr gregory of course
being among the first the following manuscript is
the story of this atlantide emperor and forms in a
sense a sequel or parallel account of the occurrences re-
lated in the story of the first expedition

cleon of yzdral

i am cleon of yzdral keeper of the gates by the
oath of poseidon first man of the ranks of
thula emperor of atlantis i was a child of ten
years when luda fell and yzdral the beautiful and all
the cities of the second world poseidon save only
thula the first city of the overlords i will be an old
man when the children of poseidon see again the first
planet this is my tale the tale of that underworld be-
neath luda and yzdral and of the things of darkness
and of those others like them yet not as they which the
men of thule have named the singing ones it is a




amazing stories

strange tale and not short yet of all men none has seen
more than i one other there was then a youth and i
a full aged man but he is-not as we

  my father was keeper before me and as a child i
remember leaving the rose-red globes of yzdral far be-
low and rising up up where strange trees and growths
of crystal mazed the roof of our inner world i remem-
ber the great bronze cup with its bare little cells and the
flaming pool of rose-light at its heart to him who was
my father the great green gates of the black tower
opened and a strange bright world of green and polished
black lay without often we ventured into it he and i
lived in its marvels for many days together we would
lie in the lush grass below the black cliffs the oily green
sea rolling afar off beneath the green sun heavy fragrant
blooms drooping over us and watched the colors play
among the shafts of white and royal purple that jutted
up from the pitted red clay and he would tell me the
lore of the race-tales tens of centuries old written in
queer old script on crumbling scrolls or handed down by
word of mouth tales of the first planet and i would
laugh wisely for even a child might know them as
dreams untrue and i was a child

  in the book of quetzal they were the scroll which is
all wre know of that first planet from which we came
it tells of an empire of many isles whose power was
all over the world-red race and black and swarthy
white even the tall fair warriors of thule and the
crafty yellow ones beyond the second sea it was a
fair wonderful world low sunk in the azure sea with
the plumed summit of snowy quetza towering above
thula of the many gates there were trees and blos-
soms of untold hue and in the air flitted little silent
forms of fragile color powdered with gem dust while
other larger beings like them but softly plumed made
music among the treetops and there came one
emperor of atlantis and priest of the thunderer who
took to himself the name of fiery quetza-ouetzalcoatl
prince of the plumed one he claimed brotherhood
with the spirits of the mountain and from the radiant
metal of the upper crags he drew the secret of the light-
nings and toyed with it for the conquest of the world
there came war with the rebel tributaries and in a
vision as he lay stricken on the floor of the council
chamber the thunderer came to him and he of the
seas who is our guardian and spoke then he saw
that his race must perish for the evil that lay in it and
he rose and called down the lightnings of zeus jupiter
upon thula but poseidon neptune intervened and
the men of atlantis came to the second planet a fairy
tale a net of dreams i thought but now-i know not

  more he told me that i believed of the outer world
where we lay far off beyond the ever rolling sea
lay quetza no longer smoke-plumed as of old and
thula the ancient now city of the overlords and be-
yond the southern land of floating rock and flaming
mountains other land there was none save this where
we lay walled by the desert of black toward the sun-
rise and toward the sunset by low crannied mountains
that dropped slow to the sea beyond between lay a
wide basin filled with rank swampage and haunted by
fearful monsters of the dead past their day long gone
lingering through chance some day he said he would
show me these

  he spoke of the overlords men of wealth and power
who drove the people of atlantis from the upper world

and lived deathless dreaming of the universe he told
of yet another quetzalcoatl hereditary prince of quetza
who led the striving races into the inner world built the
towers that brought air to the great caverns raised
yzdral and luda and kor from the level plain made
light that grain might grow and he hinted of that un-
seen dreaded underworld mile on mile beneath long
since sealed off by those who had found it and been
afraid

  i remember that day when the hard black rock sped
past beneath until a new world stretched on and on
rising from lush dark green to the rolling violet of the
far horizon below the matted swamp a green-scummed
lake and sluggish river festering in its midst beyond
swelling green uplands great open groves of fragrant
steepled trees brought from the first planet by the
overlords and other trees massive and spreading with
lobed leaves and little hard fruits in tiny scaled cups
and farther still the weathered rock of the mountains
a voice rang up and up a thrilling spiraling music of
heaven father showed me a little russet creature a
bird with speckled swelling throat that sang and sang
until our ears failed us and yet sang on higher than
man might hear-a being of the first planet too i
saw the loathsome things of the swamps-huge hulks of
swinging flesh with long thin necks and tails little flat
heads and stupid staring eyes-that bleated and bellowed
in fear and floundered helpless in the mire as our little
aero swooped low

  thula i did not see then my son he said to me
slowly when that day comes when i am gone and
you are keeper in my stead take this gem to thula
there beyond the seas and judge by what you see it is
my legacy to you and it is your duty to me and to your
grandsire to obey once-but enough

then luda was blasted and the grey clouds of
death swirled about yzdral the beautiful beneath
the trident of poseidon he stood my father and led
that hymn of the first planet which men sing over the
dead in battle a frightened child muffled in a great
suit and crystal head-piece i fled to the surface bearing
the gem which my father gave me in that last long mo-
ment before the gates were opened to the milling mob
for days i wandered over the endless sea of rolling
green until a dot of white lay on the horizon and
quetzal rose from the waters beneath my tiny aero
through the quiet streets between stately rows of
marble palaces i strode unafraid bearing my blood-red
gem to him of the snowy beard who was ruler here
and prince of quetza he took it from my outstretched
palm and gazed long at it

  once was he too one of us he said slowly he
was of the men of ancient hellas slaves of atlantis
who rose against their masters and brought beauty to
this planet at long last do ye think so harshly of us
cleon the cruel overlords who drove a decaying people
into the caverns where they might perish or else rise to
new beauty and new life he hated us i think and
when he went he swore that when this gem should re-
turn we might judge by the bearer if the people of
atlantis were not equals of hellene slaves he must
have been your fathers father cleon for with him went
a child of your age what is your thought cleon
you have seen the beauty of this upper world shall
cities mar it shall atlantis return
cleon of yzdral



  atlantis will never return o master for atlantis
is dead i seek vengeance and knowledge of that under-
world that was sealed so many ages past from which
grey death has spewed to slay the children of poseidon
if ye be men willing to judge by me a race avenge
those who have died

  oh it was short and quick like a sob i had
thought-otherwise the underworld has struck at
last tell me of it

  and i told him of the pit that had struck up through
luda of the tempests that sucked the air from our great
caverns and of the grey death-spores that rose from
below blotting out the life of our world so hideously
he listened a memory of fear in his face until i had
done

  cleon of yzdral he said finally we will avenge
atlantis we of thula know long life once before
the barrier was placed i saw that underworld if it
has opened a way of itself there can be only war it
will take many years to prepare for we have forgotten
the ways of war i will not live to see our victory or
defeat but i will show you the entrance that you may
go among them unawares and cleon if your judgment
falters in the future that must come heed my advice
place your trust in that which you see as wholly
beautiful

  thirty years is a long time and in it much was done
it had long been certain that none survived save the
hundred thousand of thula a fourth of them suited for
war for twenty years after my coming to maturity
we strove to perfect ourselves and our weapons to such
an extent that we might hope for success against the
things at which musty long-forgotten records hinted
we had the ray that carves rock long a tool of my
people and the blue barrage of the overlords but no
more vainly had i sought the ancient records for
mention of that lightning of zeus that was the weapon
of the first planet but all had been burned by that
zealot who had brought about the change and so our
plans were made

  in a small cavern just above the portal into the
underworld we had carved our first fortress and city
beside the great fault that ran up five hundred miles to
our desolate inner world the portal we would also
fortify and then carve a second fortress somewhere in
the rocky wastes of the mountains that girdled the sea
of the underworld should the first city fall the open-
ing to the surface would be automatically sealed giving
respite to the remaining people of thula

  i can never forget my first sight of the underworld
down the great chasm of the fault floated aero after
aero bearing the fifty thousand of our army to the
squat black city that was rising from the cavern floor
about it ran a thin red ribbon of orichalcum ready to
set up a barrage of flaming energy that no normal force
could pass far beyond flanking the huge arch of the
opening were long low fortresses while three great
sheets of flickering blue sealed the opening itself be-
low the fault dropped into urafathomed blackness the
sheer rocks slowly narrowing it closed at both ends of
the cavern at one of them the triple barrier

  the barrage dropped and i sped through between
the looming walls of the forts into a winding vaulted
passage that dropped slowly for perhaps a mile until it
opened high in the face of the cliff on a wilderness of
tumbled black rock harsh and ragged as if splintered by

a sudden blow far to the left through the clustered
crags a pale white sea lapped soundlessly above
luminous grey clouds hung low concealing the roof of
the huge cavern which from the curvature of the wall
must lie not far above perhaps a mile at the most to
the right the fault opened again this time widening as
it sank into the bowels of the planet and extending out
of sight along the sheer end wall of the cavern

  not until all was in readiness did we venture beyond
the mountains then leading a fleet of a hundred
aeros i set out over the troubled waste following the
chart of those who had been here many years before
then the mass of black crags was past and we sped low
over a twisted jungle of horrible vegetation-smooth
tentacular trees rising from steaming pools of creeping
yellow scum slimy limbs twisting with sentient life
livid moulds of fungi making great dripping sores in the
smooth leathery trunks-a living hellish morass
huge orchid-like blooms of rotten purple and festering
angry crimson clung to the trunks and branches stirring
hungrily as fetid putrid odors floated up from the
swamp here and there in the sluggish waters a glist-
ening formless thing would disturb the slowly stirring
yellow scum now and again a tentacular limb would
writhe down into the slime and return dripping with
filth its cup-shaped end of smoky orange slowly suck-
ing in an agonizedly twitching form once we saw a
huge pale grub larger than a man blindly groping in
the tangle of snaky roots its naked body horribly alive
with fungus it was revolting disgusting and we were
glad to skirt the steep black shore hanging low searching
for the natural amphitheater that lay somewhere beyond
this living morass

  at last it lay beneath us a narrow rising defile open-
ing into a broad low-walled oval here would be our
second walled city-fortress where we would lie in
wait while our ships searched for the unknown things
wrliose city whatever it be lay somewhere beyond in the
heart of the swamp we had come prepared to build
and soon the rock-dust was being blown aside by the
cutting blasts as a strong squat city took form on the
level plain-low enough to afford a poor target for mis-
siles massive-walled roofed with the unbroken rock
from which it was carved with the great aero-pit in its
center and tier after tier of rooms spreading out over
an area nearly equal to that of one of our great ventila-
tors about it and across the neck of the defile ran the
thin ribbons of orichalcum that gave rise to our blue
barrage all this for defense we must learn more of
the things that we must combat before we could choose
our weapons

for months we had lost contact wtith the first city
and now at last i led half our number homeward for
reinforcements low through the steaming mists skirt-
ing the shore for safety we sped toward the triply
barred portal leading to our great stronghold soon the
gaping corridor opened before us and we shot up its
tortuous length bringing up short before the opening
into the cavern shocked startled wondering the
triple barrage was gone

  reckless of all save the fate of our comrades we
hurtled through the great arch into the cave where
hope had been lay despair fused into a waxen grey
slag billowing on the cavern floor were the remains of
our city the fortress held by four-fifths of our little


amazing stories

army gone were men aeros supplies everything
cruelly annihilated while their leader was not with them
was supervising the work that a man in ranks might
have seen to gratifying his curiosity as to the strange
world beyond the barrage only the fused waste re-
mained melted by some weapon far more awful than
anything of ours it meant the end for the people of
thula as for them of yzdral and luda

  as we put about to leave a single small aero capable
of carrying twenty men dropped from the gloom of the
chasm above a lone survivor of what had occurred
we dropped to the cave floor and advanced to meet the
single figure that came to meet us he gave the salute
arm raised palm forward

  sir he reported i wras a messenger from thula
bearing a request for news of your progress as i
came into the cavern i saw at once that the barrages
at the portal and about the city were gone flooding
over the city were thousands of great spheres of light
bursting into cascades of flame that made the hard
basalt flow like water fusing the great fortress into a
smoking chaos that suddenly began to turn white with
frost then the spheres disappeared suddenly into
thin air and the cavern was empty there was a great
storm and then after a long time you came and
sir i-i suppose you do not believe me but there was
nothing there nothing but the spheres of flame i swear
it i arfl telling the truth or else-i must be mad

  i believe you you have seen nothing of this under-
world you will be more credulous when you have
you are not mad do not fear that why the explana-
tion is simple very simple and what you have seen wrill
aid us greatly the enemy whatever they are were
camouflaged to match the black rock no wonder you
could not see them what is really serious is the fact
that we are cut off from the upper world isolated to
win or lose as we stand alone we must return at
once and prepare for sudden attack come follow
us

  apparently the things did not know of our presence
in the oval valley for during the next two months we
were not molested as a further precaution against
surprise the mile of plain between the barrage and the
fortress was riddled with fine jets which would spray
forth a quickly drying white enamel effectively show-
ing up anything on it later while i was gone it was
extended beyond the barrage to give ample warning of
approach little good it could do us but that we did
not know then and when we did it was too late

  then one day tired of waiting so fruitlessly i
manned a small aero with twenty of my youngest men
and set out on a scouting cruise with me in the little
control room in the bow of the ship was the same youth
who had witnessed the destruction of the first fortress
he was named hektor hector of troy after the
custom of the overlords a name of ancient hellas he
seemed carefree and scornful of an enemy that must re-
sort to disguise and babbled light-heartedly of a long
poem which he would some day write an epic of our
conquest of the underworld there was a girl too
older than he back in thula who would welcome him a
hero and be less haughty before the returned warrior
he sang the old songs of the first planet epics always
of that first prince of quetzal who bore learning into
the western lands under the plumed manner of the
world-serpent quetza whose mouth was the mountain

above thula of the old sea-rovers whence our race
sprang rousing ballads of war and victory and reward
poor lad how could he guess that he would never again
see thula never even be able to die i was twice his
age already grey why could i not have gone rather
than he i think that to me life among the singing
ones would not be cruel but for him with hopes and
memories fresh in his mind i am sure that that part of
him that is yet of man yearns for the old life but it
was not willed

  and now miles away over the steaming swamps the
land was rising slightly giving birth to a new form of
life the grey and slimy yellow of the jungle gave
place to a riotous chaos of raw color-bruised purples
angry crimsons wan whites smoky oranges pale blues
there lay an enormous tangled forest of gigantic fungi
bulbous and distorted that stretched as far as the eye
could scan into the lowering grey mists there were
huge bulbs on thick stems and slender twisting spires
and thick squat slabs-a livid nightmare forest and
above it billowed vast dark clouds that tossed uneasily
in the fitful air currents that swept in from the swamp-
land the grey death-dust that had slain yzdral here
somewhere in this wilderness of raw rotting color must
be the city the stronghold of the things we sought
even as we looked out over the twisted sea of vegetation
the luminous mists swept aside for an instant and there
at the limit of sight lay a blot of color more vivid even
than the fungi a blaze of crimson that vanished again
as the clouds swooped in around us at a word from
me we drifted slowly over the wilderness of fungus
growths toward that half-seen vision moving slowly and
carefully to avoid surprise for in that instant we might
well have been seen

  hektor was watching the twisted forest drift past be-
neath us trying to count the myriad forms and colors
perhaps even classifying them mentally suddenly he
pointed ahead

  look sir below there-that cloud it must be
from a very different sort of fungus for it is black so
very black that it is hard to see all these other spore-
clouds are grey like the death-dust might we hover
for a moment sir so that i can look for the fungus

  certainly it is a very interesting thing to find here
is it not give the order to drop and hover over it

  i was myself interested for the cloud was extremely
queer-looking it was as hektor had said practically
invisible seen only in silhouette against the vivid colors
of the fungus below it it was moving slowly as if it
were being sucked up into a sort of spherical ball mov-
ing with a queer viscidity that i had never seen in vapor
before it was apparently very dense hanging even
lower than the luminous ceiling of clouds and the masses
of grey spores just above the tops of the fungi

now we were hanging motionless barely five hun-
dred feet above it and i could see plainly that it
was condensing into a smooth perfect sphere that seemed
to be revolving slowly yes it was spinning more and
more rapidly with every second and shrinking simul-
taneously into a globe less than half the size of the
original sphere i could feel a tenseness in the air a
breathlessness that plucked at the mind and stretched it
to the breaking point hektor looked drawn and pale
beside me his eyes filled with something that i could
not state in words but which i could feel in me too
cleon of yzdral



tearing at my mentality then the tension burst the
black sphere leapt in an instant to twice its original size
then collapsed again like a pricked bladder into a little
black globe from whose hidden heart burned a rosy
radiance spreading swelling into a great mottled orb
of opalescent flame that spun dazzlingly before us as
the tension grew again to unbearable magnitude be-
side me hektor gave a strangled agonized groan ris-
ing suddenly to a high-pitched chatter of terror

  zeus the flame poseidon save me why do
you stand there you fool zeus damn you cant you
see it is the flame-the thing

  madly he hurled me aside and jerked at the controls
like a talcon unhooded we sprang into the air fled
blindly what could he mean was he mad fasci-
nated by the shining globe of light or could it be-
could that cloud of black vapor be the thing we were
seeking to destroy the reply came soon from the
whirling ball of light a light darted jet on jet of rose-
flame beautiful but awful blinding us on the instant
came a blaze of awful heat then we were falling head-
long through empty air gasping in the unnatural at-
mosphere the half destroyed control room still about
us while ship crew everything else fell in a searing rain
of molten matter huge twisted forms rushed up at
us there was a pulpy rending a shattering of crystal
and black silence

  i came to myself to find the remains of the control
room buried in a disgusting mass of fungoid refuse
which we had brought with us in our crashing descent
this it was that broke our fall and saved us from later
destruction by the black mist-creature for when we
struggled out of our crystal prison shaken and filthy
but otherwise quite safe we found the fused remains of
the aero fairly bristling with frost crystals the air
near the wreck was deathly cold and the fungi nearest
the burned area were shriveling under the unaccustomed
temperature above from the lowering clouds wras
dropping a fine grey snow such as is but rarely found
in the upper world

  hektor rather sheepish since his display of unguarded
terror spoke timidly

  sir what makes this we saw that thing melt the
aero we felt the awful heat and now it is so cold-
frost forms on the wreckage i-i cannot understand
how it can be yet it is just as i saw it before at the
city he shuddered at the memory of that scene

  i am beginning to understand much of the nature of
this thing hektor i replied perhaps if we can
reach the fortress again i can devise a weapon or a bet-
ter defense it hurls energy pure energy drawn from
itself into whatever it attacks causing it to disrupt and
fuse under the strain and sudden release of heat then
when it is all over it sucks back the energy out of the
molten mass its own energy and the energy of the
thing it destroyed leaving it absolutely heatless i
think hektor that were that fused metal not too aw-
fully cold to touch even the smallest bit would tax our
strength to lift its particles are packed very closely
closer than in anything natural that we may find does
not that mass of metal seem small to have been an aero
and does it not seem unnaturally smooth and dense
were we to remain here it would expand almost visibly
as heat came into it from the air and gave its particles
energy of motion kinetic energy but it is too cold
to remain here and the convection currents will bring

on a storm such as you saw in the cavern of the first
city a storm the like of which these jungles have never
seen have you any idea as to where the fortress
lies

  none sir the compass was in the other part of
the control cabin

  then we must search as best we can for the edge
of this forest where we can see the mountains there
will be the swamp to cross though unless they search
for us with an aero come we are doing no good here
and the thing may return

  for days on end we struggled through that putrid
tangle that was the ages-old floor of the fungus forest
while overhead the pale clouds were tossed and torn by
the great winds that raged through the thin air limited
only by that thinness while great fungi toppled and fell
about us with a horrid liquid crushing of massive fleshy
growths adding to the deep mat of decayed matter that
covered the ground rivers of cold air followed the
contour of the fungus jungle blighting the huge bul-
bous things as they flowed through the hollows but
the storm was brief in duration the half-buried mass
taking up heat very quickly from the rotting mould
though not as fast as the fortress with its far greater sur-
face then at last after many days of blind stumbling
through that nightmare wilderness suffering from the
thin air until our burning lungs adapted themselves to
their task the fungi grew smaller thinned and vanished
entirely leaving us on the edge of a great smooth cup of
glassy black basalt that sloped steeply down for nearly
half a mile and curved out in a mighty oval bowl five
miles across

  in it lay the crimson city of the vapor creatures
built entirely of crimson marble with an underlying
tinge of deep scarlet it lay like a blazing coal in the
heart of the black bowl its architecture was very evi-
dently patterned after the fungi that swarmed about it
squat bulging shapes massed about huge towering
shafts-spherical dome on slender column spiraling
flame-tongue thick-stemmed hooded parasol-all the
myriad shapes of the fungi adapted to suit habitation
and carved entirely from the crimson marble at the
edges the buildings were low and sprawling and as the
center was reached they rose into a thrusting twisted
maze of crimson forms shooting up in a nightmare
wilderness in perfect monochrome mimicry of the mon-
strous jungle behind us clustering about some central
horror that was hidden from us and everywhere be-
tween the smooth red walls flowed dense black shapes
of mist drifting slowly and flowing in viscid haste from
opening to black opening that flecked the crimson shafts
above the silence from somewhere in the citys heart
rose a fine thin keening at the very peak of the ability to
hear as of a taut wire whining in the gale it was a
tense unpleasant sound that made me shudder involun-
tarily sending little icy chills up and down my spine and
i saw hektor grit his teeth suddenly and fiercely at the
sound yet there was damnable fascination in it and
in the city with its tangled inferno of crimson stone and
we stood gazing at it regardless of the danger of our
position

we suspected nothing until the reflection of the
city in the polished rock at our feet suddenly
vanished and a darting arm of black vapor rose to
blot out the crimson vision then dropped about us at


amazing stories

once we knew that these invisible things were not of any
ordinary vapor for through such we might have
ploughed with ease to the shelter of the fungi this
black stuff was as dense as it looked and denser by
far for we battered at its closing wall as at rock yet
it had not the feeling of rock to the touch for there was
a yielding to it almost as of flesh and a subtle energy
that made me tingle from head to foot strange stuff
indeed a definite physical barrier yet for all its firm-
ness a vapor whose outer edges were tossed by the
winds that still stirred frankly it was beyond all my
understanding of the properties of matter certain it
was that such a property must needs be governed by con-
scious control like a flexing of our own muscles yet it
should have been utterly impossible in a vapor my
mind refused to grasp its actuality

  now the vapor swirled above and beneath us and the
solid ground dropped out from under our feet there
was a moments sickening drop into emptiness then a
long smooth glide constantly accelerating and a series of
complex motions that we were unable to interpret one
thing gave us a clue trapped as we were in the heart of
the vapor thing the piercing wail from the crimson
city swelled into nerve-shattering shrillness rising slight-
ly in pitch as we sped faster then seemed to loose its di-
rection and pureness of pitch telling us that we were
now in the city itself speeding between those echoing
crimson walls

  and now the thing thickened beneath our feet and
we were shoved up and out through a widening gap
into the light out on the top of the great cloud of vapor
encircled to the waist with its binding coils we were
driving straight into that tumbled labyrinth of crimson
fantasy that was the heart of the city through the
twisting corridors pouring from narrow slot-like open-
ings converging on our creature and j billing themselves
to it came hoards of the vapor things great and small
wisp and cloud merging in one great body one enormous
thing carrying us zeus knew whither for some great
unknown purpose that required its presence as an inte-
grated entity a race of one thing yet of numberless
parts

  the distorted crimson walls clustered closer denser
merging into a great oval central mass of rose-pink a
narrow black slit high in its side and we were being
lifted high on a column of black mist racing at breath-
taking speed straight for that single visible opening then
hurtling through and down into the light again the body
of the mist sweeping after us

  we were in a mighty bowl of purest white blending
to a rose-flush at the towering edges up from its very
center stabbed a flickering shaft of vivid blue light and -
from it shrieked the wailing shattering at our ears in-
cessantly filling all the great bowl with its horrid din

a misty arm shot forth from the body of cloud that bore
us and caressed a squat black block set with little red
cups that lay beside the gaping pit from which the shaft
sprung the shriek rose to a crescendo and vanished and
in the folds of my clothing i felt a crystal lens shatter to
bits and then we were set down beside the low black
railing that barred us from the blue shaft while all about
bathing the snowy walls of the cup with their inky flood
were the mist folk circling us completely barring all
escape save the pit as in answer to my thought an arm
of vapor shot forth from the edge of the black mass
wrenched the slender pack from hektors back and

flicked it into the shaft of blue light it vanished into
a golden haze that became merely a local deepening of
the blue then diffused and disappeared there was no
escape there

  what followed i have never precisely understood--
how the vapor creatures were able physically to suck in-
formation-thoughts-from our brains but the fact
remains out of that murky cloud visible only by the
dead black contrast of its boundaries sprang two thin
coils of mist that settled rigidly over our heads capping
them with clinging black fog closing about our brains
they had not the cold damp feeling of fog or of most
of the ordinary vapors but almost a bodily warmth
filled with pure energy i felt as never before the alive-
ness of these folk of black mist

  through the snug contact of the caps i could feel a
rhythmic unease flowing through all that great mass
stirring it in slow uncertain waves that gained strength
and purpose as time passed felt what i could not see
then came the voice of the creatures how produced i
know not but a true voice of communication and ex-
pression entirely apart from the unity of thought con-
tact that was in their strange mingling it was a low
deep-throated crooning floating up as at a great distance
with something of a forlorn wail in its fathomless depth
at first like busy insects in the gardens of thula it
came tentative and dreamy then with the purpose and
unison of the swarming hive swelling in volume and
meaning far beyond all human powers of comparison
lifting in long surging billows of sound that lulled like
the listless swell of the sea in calm we were comfort-
able drowsy wrapped snugly in the warm blankets of
the mist soothed by the rolling drone of music that
flooded about us lulling and lulling sleep was good
after all the labor of the past and i felt my senses numb-
ing slowly deadening my will slipping lazily into slum-
ber but somewhere as a bright clear flame in the
dreaming sea of blackness conscious awareness burned
in my brain even as my muscles sagged in unconscious-
ness it blazed bright almost as a second external self
and in it or with it i felt the cunning draining of my
mind the sapping of my knowledge sucked out into
that great body of black life every fact every thought
and nervous impression of my life flowing eagerly into
that relentless maw and i knew that the hidden fort-
ress was doomed

  i do not know how long i lay senseless part of the
things i came again to life in a small unbroken sphere
of crimson rock ventilated lighted i know not how
in my brain lingered the mocking echo of the crooning
of the mist people and with it an emptiness a lightness
a feeling of expansion and i remembered the sucking of
the vampire things i must still have been of them in
part for as i gazed bewildered about me a portion of
the wall receded and disappeared showing a vaulted
well-lit passage without weakly i crawled through the
narrow opening and started slowly down the corridor
toward the faint gleam of day at its end smooth and
oval it ran straight to a great railed balcony jutting out
over the city rooms there must have been cells like
mine but as mine their doors were invisible

leaning wearily against the broad rail was a fa-
miliar figure-hektor younger than i his mind
probably less strained by the drawing forth of its
smaller store he had recovered sooner with a word he

greeted me then turned to gaze again out over the
tangled chaos of spires and rounded roof-tops that
marked the upper levels of the city the screaming of
the blue shaft had begun again dinning in our ears
from somewhere beyond our own building while oc-
casionally a muffled booming rose from the narrow
gorges of the streets where vocally conversing vapor-
creatures drifted to and fro for a long time hektor
was silent then without turning he spoke

  cleon-sir-you have seen more of this world than
i understand better its laws and possibilities i have
thought often before of the life that is in us of what
forms it might assume but never did i imagine this
this-these things are alien to me impossible how can
life be like this where is its analogy in our outer
world oh cleon i am afraid-of what i cannot
tell but deathly afraid when i felt them draining me
of my thoughts there in the arena i was afraid that i
would never regain them never awake to this universe
at least i have a queer feeling here in the back of my
brain that we are dim to them unreal fearful menaces
perhaps i think that they are keyed higher than we-
that their droning is communication by touch rather than
by sound that that cursed wailing is but a gentle murmur
to them even below the range of hearing except when
it rises beyond our own perhaps they are not entirely
as we see them vapor creatures but truly firm and solid
in some other plane and yet-their life must be
strange conflicting for they are aware of our world
their buildings are of it i-it is beyond me there is
truth in what i say i feel it somehow and yet-there
are lies cunning lies to trap us it-my mind-tells
me so

  and i replied

  it may well be as you say hektor i do not know
but to me there is nothing impossible or without analogy
in them to me hektor they are much as we
they are vapor true and an unnatural vapor but i
think they belong to this world more than to any other
fundamentally there is the same backing of natural
laws though the application may be different how do
we establish contact with our world and apply our
science do we not draw energy from our own bodies
to battle against man and nature do we not use pure
energy change it from form to form-matter light
heat work-put it into the planet from which we draw
it again in food and power to replenish and augment
our store we are not very efficient in our processes
and so we die but these creatures need no bypaths and
bridges in their cycle of energy you saw that quality
in their destruction of the aero-how they changed the
energy of their bodies into the flame that fused the
metal instantly then drew it back and more with it
to keep life in themselves where fundamentally is
the difference

  and then their curious oneness their seeming ability
to act individually or as one unified entity never quite
one or the other but always bound together by some tie
which we do not understand are we not the same
think of us men each working for self and for race
alike living thinking acting alone or all too often in
mobs welded together by a single cause a single
thought into unified action have you never seen a
great mob flowing like a mighty wave of humanity re-
lentlessly to their single purpose its single purpose
thinking and acting as one being  i have seen men flow

thus as a mighty flooding wave in liquid-or in vapor
is there so great a difference

  even their existence in vapor i can understand
dimly can find analogy in ourselves to me solid life
would be harder to understand than yielding plastic
vapor you have never seen truly solid life hektor
nor has any man what of our own bodies the bodies
of the other beasts of our outer world are they not
built up of myriad tiny cells tiny unit lives liquid lives
we are liquid hektor made firm and purposeful by
the unity of life these creatures about us are vapor as
we are liquid and their unity must be greater than ours
as must be their power their controlling mental strength
that makes them what they are

  no hektor there is not such a great gap between
us and them everywhere that life is found there are
its basic factors the fundamentals that identify it-con-
trolled transformation of energy the ability of conscious
unification and motion to a purpose all things all
evolution from lower form all progress of great races
hinge on these perhaps all hinge upon the first though
my mind asks for more than that alone many say that
life is but an automatic behavior resulting from natural
laws blind and helplessly mechanical do not these laws
of nature outline a purpose toward which all life
moves many say that evolution follows accidental
paths toward degeneration or monstrosity but was there
not a purpose in that motion from a simple to a complex
existence futile though the result may be many very
many say that because of mans machines and his
science he shall sink back into oblivion die the death of
a race but do not his machines make more efficient his
control of energy enlarge his store limitlessly enable
him to mould the universe into a likeness of the purpose
that includes all things there are differences hektor
differences that make many men deny life for what it is
we are not as an amoeba nor as a sea-worm nor a
flower these vapor folk are not as we but to my
mind the difference is a simple one all things differ
in life we are more alive far more alive than the
bacillus or the worm and these vapor creatures are
more alive than we any race any entity that is able to
fulfill the three bases of life is able to control the energy
of the world about him and unify and move steadily
toward the purpose that lies behind everything and
who can do these more intelligently more efficiently
than we must be more alive than we

  zeus poseidon bel-whatever you may call him
who has formed the purpose and written the equation
of space and time has made sure that so long as life
shall be so shall progress exist we are part of that
equation governing it and governed by it our path pre-
destined yet flexible to our every will some day per-
haps after eternity beyond infinity a race will grasp that
purpose in its entirety see the great equation in its full
man will not but man will have shortened the road by
many an endless age near the top the way grows
rougher steeper and race after race must live and pour
its life into another race and pass away not dead but
absorbed into living when two paths conflict one
must give way as we are giving way to these things
these vapor creatures there must be conflict for-
ever but we must know it for what it is an attempt to
put away inefficiency and disunion by whatever sordid

a babylonian deity god of the earth he was in a triad with amri god
of the heavens and ea god of the waters


amazing stories

name we call it or by whatever cruel method we ac-
complish it and to rise like the bird of quetzal above
the ashes of the past men will fight men until man
must fight another race and rise on its ashes but in
fighting men may defeat that ultimate hidden urge and
to a degree die sink beneath their peak for long ages
perhaps forever while a lesser race takes their place and
climbs unaided to new heights that might have been theirs

  but this is dreaming-preaching i cannot explain
what i feel cannot feel all that is there in a way it is
written on space and time in a way it is for man to
write it these things are higher than we but we must
strive against them and if we win we shall rise higher
than they in ages to come

  a little i see o cleon said hektor but much is
clouded unclear you are older than i though my
years are no longer my age and your vision may be
broader the equation i can almost grasp-its pres-
ence and nature but not its meaning and yet-ah well
come i know the way to the streets we are free in
this city but unable to leave it -let us try to under-
stand more of this queer race and how it may be de-
feated come

  as hektor said the city was open to us mentally we
were en rapport with the things and doors were not
barred to us we found little that we could compre-
hend life was not as we knew it understood it the
red buildings were there riddled with curious cells and
corridors but we could not tell their significance in this
vapor world whether home or shelter or-what the
vapor things ignored us flowed silently around us in
ugly torrents as if we were rocks in the path one bit
of machinery we found one tangible thing that could be
studied and understood in part-the pit in the arena
which we named the pit of blue sound

  out of that great railed pit vomited a mighty beam
of sound waves of enormous frequency that battered at
matter and tore it into its component atoms in the
white arena the thin air above it was ripped asunder
energized until it gave off the blue light of the beam
beside the pit lay the only mechanical device that we
found in all the crimson city-a plate of crystal vi-
brated by electrical energy as we have done in the
laboratories of thula setting up a wave of sound in it-
self destructive to life and far beyond the range of the
senses by interference the two waves merged into
one heterodyned as some would say giving a lower note
the high thin wail of the blue shaft this we discovered
by experiment and by reasoning but the source of the
blue sound somewhere far below the city we could not
imagine physical phenomenon production of the
vapor-things of something higher still than they-i
shall never know which we of thula know only its
nature its resulting phenomena and no more hektor-
but hektor cannot tell perhaps as we thought by reason
of its location it was the deity of the things or else
their place of execution if such could exist in such a
race but all was mere conjecture and yet i think it
was not entirely of these but still more even as the sap-
phire wonder of the singing ones but i must go on

hektor of late often explored without me delv-
ing down in the dark corridors beneath the city
then one day he returned pale and strangely silent

   the quetzal was a bird considered a deity or symbol of a deity by
the aztecs and mayas it is the national emblem of guatemala as the
eagle is of the united states or the lion of england

with fear and guilt in his suddenly aged eyes he re-
fused to go out again seemed to shun the open where
he might see and be seen by the vapor people he
would not speak to me of what he had seen but once
as he muttered in his infrequent uneasy sleep i caught
a few disjointed words that made me wonder and fear
likewise he mouthed the words hoarsly and whispered
cunningly to himself his open eyes fixed on emptiness

  the glory-the glory-ah the white glory of light i
have seen it-seen it-they do not know they will
not know not for many days-hard hard but brit-
tle  oh yes very brittle-but they do not know they
must not they will kill us we must escape-but
we cannot not from them-oh i was mad mad to fear
to strike but i did not know i thought it was as they
are soft and yielding not brittle-the glory ah
zeus i am afraid afraid

  he had found something wonderful apparently some-
where in the bowels of the city something beautiful but
fearful and in mad terror had struck blindly had
smashed it it was something of awful importance
something whose destruction meant our death as soon as
it should be discovered-a god perhaps or something
akin and i was afraid with hektor and waited for the
day when they must discover his deed and sweep in a
thick cloud of fury toward us

  it came a day of double horror to me again we were
borne to the arena again the white walls flowed black
vapor again close-fitting caps of mist enclosed our
throbbing brains but this time thoughts came to me
pictures and i understood that for all this time these
creatures of mist had been resting feeding storing up
energy for the great final destruction

  i saw the narrow defile through the black cliffs clouds
of inky vapor billowing against the barrier of blue i
saw the spheres of flame form saw the barrier flicker
and fade and the towers of safety fuse and flow then
the army of the things had poured out over the plain
circling the single frail wall of blue fire trying it seek-
ing out its weakest spot with devilish cunning they
did not fear it for energy is but food to their kind but
food in sudden excess is unsafe the fort lay silent be-
hind its girdle of white against which the black flow
of the hordes showed clearly and now hovering above
the blasted rock of the defile i saw an aero one of our
old aeros of yzdral the upper world had come to our
rescue

  for a single instant my heart leaped wildly with joy
then sank in disgust and hate for they of the aero
were cowards craven some new powerful weapon
they must have else they had not come in so small an
aero it lay in their power to save us save their own
kin men of their race from the awful death of the
vapor things and they slunk in safety beyond the rim
of the plain fearing to risk their precious lives for
others afraid to trust in the judgment of those men of
wisdom who had armed and sent them forth to conquer
cowards all unfit to bear the banner of poseidon 

  my mind turned in aversion turned to the fortress
where a great sphere of opalescence was forming send-
ing forth little streamers of rose flame that melted into
the blue barrier and beat it down in a torrent of ming-
ling fusing fire over the helpless city poured the hosts
of the things fusing it to a smoking mass of slag then
sucking forth its energy until it glistened white with
frost and now with savage gladness in my heart i saw
cleon of yzdral



the craven aero flee in sudden terror out across the
swamp the black mists swirling after

  of a sudden the picture was blotted out and angrily
the mist folk tore at my mind into my brain flashed
the truth in victory they had sought that which hektor
had destroyed had found it dead and shattered had
come to avenge on the instant i was jerked high
hektor beside me before me the mist bulked high
began to spin and thicken in the form of a great sphere
i felt the tearing at our senses the plucking at our
brains the tensing of the vibrant atmosphere and then
the ball of flame burst forth in our very faces not
opalescent as before but angry red shot with little dazzl-
ing corruscations of electric blue nearly within the
reach of my arm it hung towering above us a living
ball of glorious flame yet heatless and pulsing with con-
suming hate and evil from it leapt tiny ribbons of
flame narrow blue tentacles that streamed past me to
where hektor hung whimpering and plucked him from
his place as he was hurled past me into the heart of
the sphere i could see his body alive with leaping crack-
ling blue fire bathing him and sinking into him then
he was gone and the great sphere burst into blinding
white light as the angry drone of the vapor things rose
to a frenzied crescendo and then he was spewed forth
strangely rigid into my grasp as a man dead yet filled
with the hellish life of the things

  the sphere was forming again swiftly the little blue
streamers leaping from its whirling surface then darting
toward me but even as they swept over me the vibrant
energy of them thrilling and surging in me there came a
rushing roar of mighty winds and i was hurled high
above the great bowl by the force of the tempest and
borne along on the wings of the wind hektor clutched
in my arms the sphere of flame gone forever for an
instant i saw advancing swiftly through the broken for-
est of fungi a great wall of pale white water dimly
luminous bearing down with awful speed upon the
crimson city the sea had broken through the moun-
tains  then i was hurtling above the lashing jungle
all about me torn wrisps of scudding black showing dim
against the riddled clouds borne by the terrible fury of
the winds my breath was sucked from my striving
lungs by the tempest and all the world dissolved in
flame-shot blackness

  i woke in a welter of whipping waters borne like a
bit of drift from crest to trough hektor still lying rigid
in my locked grip a black hulk was silhouetted against
the clouds then rushed down upon us-one of the great
living trees of the swamp vainly my weakened hands
scrabbled at the leathery smoothness of the huge trunk
then as it seemed about to plunge over me and beat me
down into the pale water my clawing fingers sank into
one of the many great sores eaten by fungi into the
otherwise unbroken trunk sank deep and clung desper-
ately slowly i began to raise hektor to lay his stiff
body across the broad trunk of the tree and follow him
to safety and after an age it was done and i sank
again into sleep

  the waters were still when i awoke rising and fall-
ing in long uneasy swells hektor lay beside me motion-
less his body set as in death yet i could see the faint
pulse of veins in his temple and hear the slow hiss of
breath through clenched teeth about us the milky sea
ran endlessly away beneath the scudding clouds the
black crags were lost in distance now and beneath these

troubled waters lay the drowned jungles of that un-
known land beyond the crimson city the great tree on
which we lay too was different from those that we
had seen before the slatey trunk and leathery skin-
like bark were the same but its tentacles were slenderer
more ribbon-like and fitted with meshed clusters of
filaments like little nets about the edge of the crimson
sucking-cups this tree must have fed in water that
was flowing bearing food into the net that it set its
roots bore this out they were stouter and less flexible
than those of the swamp trees somewhere then the
swamp must have an outlet but where  were we being
borne into the chasm of this buried world

  for untold time we drifted and it seemed to my
troubled mind that the current had a definite set that we
were being carried to a certain death and through all
those fear-filled hours hektor lay stiff and motionless
beside me then far before us appeared a low-slung
mass speeding in our direction against the current
with every hour of pressing time it drew nearer and i
could see a great monsters head rising from a dully
gleaming body with flailing limbs on either side-a
dragon of the sea but even as i drew my sword i
saw a second figure standing where the neck of the mon-
ster joined its half-submerged body-a human figure
clad in glittering metal scales with golden hair stream-
ing free beneath a winged helm and i knew him for
what he was-a man of thule

centuries ago in the days of the first planet
thule and atlantis shared the world island at-
lantis and thule of the many gates-a mountain land
writh myriad narrow arms of the sea breaking the pre-
cipitous coastline from an ancient root older than
man comes the words that name them-thula city of
the many portals thule land of the many fjords it
was a northern land where the sun often hung low above
the grey sea for long week after week and mountains
of ice swept down the sea lanes from the pole-a hard
land and the land of a hard race for the men of thule
were savage warriors all and in their dragon ships
patterned after beasts of legend that no man now remem-
bers they swept the seas to the southward bringing
death and destruction with them upon atlantis they
fell but the cunning of that race that had conquered mu
of the emerald isles and the barren uplands of the yellow
ones was too great for their valor and they fell before
us but the fathers of atlantis were born old and in
their wisdom they forgave the bold men of the north
and made them allies we gave them of our culture
such as they could understand and from the squalid
savages rose a race of god-men-giants all with flowing
hair and beard of spun gold and eyes keen and blue
as good steel when thula came to the second planet
many were with us and when the overlords drove forth
the degenerate people the men of thule went also of
their own will and purpose-no man knew whither save
perhaps that quetzal who led the way

  the dragon ship rushed down upon us and with a
straining of oars hung still like a falcon poised strong
arms dragged us over the low gunwales great hands
warriors hands gave me food and drink and strove to
force it upon hektor but in vain and as wre sped
through the cresting sea he who was their leader thor-
vald nilsson told me the history of the men of thule
after they left the upper world


amazing stories

  they had gone with quetzalcoatl and his followers
into the caverns where the race settled but unlike them
went onward and downward to a narrow land beyond
the white sea of the underworld-a fertile land lit by an
everflowing river of molten rock where real trees grew
and flowers with beasts that their fathers had fought
in the north of thule in days long gone and here they
lived and launched their dragon ships in the strange
white sea that lapped upon their bouldered beaches
in a single great fjord the pale-lit waters ran past
the walls of rock that barred their pleasant land from the
weird world of the things long since they had found
this unnatural land and the black things and with them
another race of which he spoke but vaguely the singing
ones they avoided these shores but when the sea
rushed down upon the underworld they were drawn
into the mad maelstrom and spewed out upon the silent
waters that hid the swamps and the crimson city

  i have seen such as he before o man of yzdral
he said and some the singing ones have made whole
again but sometimes even they have failed i think it
will be wise to seek them for if it be as ye have said
that this man has unveiled the secret of the black ones
such as remain will seek ye out for vengeance and with
the singing ones we will be safe there is danger of
the chasm with this flood pouring through the gate but
we of thule have never yet feared danger nor ever will
and it comes to me that ye are not one to flinch

  and now we put about and ran with the current save
faster for a long time how long i cannot say for our
chronoscopes were gone and there was no night here
even as thorvald i took my turn at the oars strength-
ening my sickened muscles or engaged in sword-play on
the short forward deck with the shouts of the rowers
in my ears above the hiss of the waves and the oars and
always hektor lay as dead breathing slowly his pulse a
mere flicker yet needless of food or drink so great was
the energy that the sphere of the things had poured into
him

  to north and south the mountains had appeared
drawing in from the low horizon in a great funnel into
which the rushing waters poured now we had no need
of oars for the leaping waves bore us on with awful
speed the wind whipping our beards and hair and scream-
ing in our ears the oarsmen were resting building
strength for their final great struggle with the sea now
the walls of black were narrowing faster drawing to-
gether to form a great river of wanly flaming water
whose shores rose steep to the drooping clouds at first
miles in width the rushing torrent swept down into a
narrow channel bitten deep in the rock barely a hundred
feet across in which the white waves leaped and boiled
as in a cauldron dashing high against the smooth-cut
walls still no man took to the oars except to save us
from crashing into the walls but as time passed i
sensed a tensing an awaiting for some last struggle for
life or death above the howl of the wind in the
gorge and the lashing roar of angry water rose a new
sound a drumming thunder far distant and muffled by
the echoing cliffs and now thorvald rose from his
seat where he had been idly gaming with dice left hand
against right and strode to the guiding oar as silently
each man took his seat and rubbed into his palms the
rosin that assured his grip on the oars the great oars
rose and swung forward lying against the hull ready
to plunge and strike at a sign from thorvald i drag-

ged hektor to a spot just under the sweeping dragons 
neck and lashed him there with leather thongs then
joined the chieftain at the steering oar

  the drumming rose louder now drowning out all else
in its thunderous roar thorvald raised to his lips the
great brazen horn of chieftainship and gazed down
the mist-filled gorge waiting and now through the
luminous spray i saw that two mighty peaks jutted out
from either wall between them a boats length of space
through which the raging waters surged and battled
rising high then leaping out out and down into nothing-
ness through the curtain of water the twin crags
loomed bare and smooth from the torrents edge the left
jet black the right-it seemed-a flaming gold then
the great horn blared forth its message the oars struck
deep and for an instant we hung checked in our mad
course held by the straining oars then swept on with
the flood again and again they plunged each mighty
blow bringing us up as against a yielding wall each
time hurtling on as before and now we thrust with all
our weight at the great helm driving it slowly against
the leaping stream now with each giant beat of the
oars i could see the rushing wall to the right creep
closer and ever closer the oars beat faster now in
perfect rhythm and the struggling helm battered fiercely
at our strength now i could hear above the tumult of
waters a chant of human voices raised in a song of
battle and i joined my voice to theirs in the stirring
anthem of yzdral

  before us the bounding waves climbed up and up a
hundred feet or more above our heads battering at the
crevice that overhung the great abyss great waves
broke over us not salt but sickly sweet and filled with
a fungoid savor beating at us in great masses of leap-
ing white fire that swooped down from the tossing
clouds and still the oars struck firm and sure and
the helm crept slowly to the right fiery darts of pain
shot through my straining muscles and i saw thor-
valds teeth gripped in his lower lip blood streaming into
his matted beard and now the cauldron fell away be-
neath and the dragon ship hung high above the abyss
into which the waters thundered down and out and
down again into the endless depths where pale-lit mists
swirled slowly with dreamy lethargy for an instant
we poised there an eternal instant of reminiscence and
despair in which all the forgotten faces of childhood
spun before me in a slow dead whirl then like a gyr-
falcon we swooped through empty air down and down
into sudden silence the howling waters but a lost mur-
mur in the distance lulling lulling our tired muscles into
sleep no longer did we plunge madly through the blaz-
ing waves but rocked in a gentle swell a soft blue light
seeping through the perfumed air about us-surely the
paradise of death thorvald beside me i drifted off
into velvet darkness

i woke to the gentle grip of thorvalds hand the
oarsmen were gone and he stood silhouetted against
a soft blue luminescence that played in little dancing
wavelets from the ceiling of the great cave in which
we floated now i realized the truth of what had hap-
pened the mountain on the right was hollow and in
the very center of the narrow gap through which the
waters leaped opened the arched gateway into which

   the old vikings of scandinavia called their warships dragons they
often had a dragons head on the bow
cleon of yzdral



we had passed with that final thrust of oars down into
the calm slowly eddying lagoon beneath the mountain
ordinarily when the river merely drained the stagnant
swamp it must be difficult enough to enter but now
with a sea pouring through that cranny between the
peaks it was by little short of superhuman skill and
strength that these men of thule had won us through

  we lay beside a smooth black pier jutting from the
wall of the cave the cave itself was low-roofed and
broad stretching out into the blue haze on either side
here a great niche had been cut into the wall fronted
with pillars that glowed with little inlaid twinings of soft
gold from it opened many corridors running off into
the mountain and a broad stair rising into the peak
above us it was lit by the blue light and rose easily
in lazy spirals through the black rock of the peak all
along the walls ran the delicate golden inlay much like
the fretting of the ventilators of our upper world but
more gentle and beautiful patterned after the twining
vines and tendrils of some unknown vegetation up
this we strode bearing hektor between us thorvald
seemingly familiar with the way glancing down at the
steps i could see that they were worn and the edges
rounded by much use during long ages what people
had carved this stronghold in the heart of the mountain
who were the singing ones

  the peak was conical and as we rose the stair drew
near the outer wall and the roar of the fall sounded far
below at last came a landing and a niche in the wall
a little alcove from which we might see the river far
beneath us up from the leaping flood rose the black
cliff sloping inward in mirror image of that which
loomed opposite and above and about us rising in ter-
raced levels clung the golden city of the singing ones

  in level after level of blunt-topped golden towers the
city rose above us circling the cone of the peak smooth
from the crag the outer wall would rise to a series of
little steps in reality broad terraces dwarfed by dis-
tance then up again in a slender golden block to a blunt
terraced summit balconied windows opened from the
smooth golden wall looking out over the river and the
abyss into which it plunged feathering into luminous
mist that drifted up through the thin air to the low-hang-
ing clouds that clung about the summit of the peak on
the terraces and in the broad ways between the ranks
of buildings grew trees and flowers climbing in per-
fumed profusion over the golden fretting of the inner
walls and like a halo over the city clung the blue light
illuminating everything with its soft azure what man-
ner of men could these singing ones be to raise such
a city on the crag and make trees and flowers bloom in
this unhealthy underworld

  now as we climbed higher i heard a music flooding
from above a music as of organ notes deep and brood-
ing spangled with merry piping and silvery tinkling of
little bells then the stair turned suddenly and stopped
and i followed thorvald out upon a high dais of gold
bearing hektor

  before me the golden amphitheater was filled with
light light such as i had never seen it lay on the
border line between light and mist both and yet neither
it was of a rose-hue a faintly flushed pink with little
veinings of scintillant silver in a great motionless flood
it lay in the bowl of the amphitheater pulsing dreamily
through it ran tiny filaments of clotted coral flame
glittering mischievously through the soft glow darting

and twisting through the surge of rose-light the glow
of it lit up all the golden temple with rosy glory brighter
and softer than the green light of the upper world
for an instant i thought of the snowy bowl of the
vapor things but this was different here was not
clinging creeping vapor dank black fog that clogged
the senses with loathing and bound the muscles with in-
visible resistance this light was free clean beautiful
vibrant with pure life whetting the senses and cleansing
the mind of the ugly darknesses that lurk in its hidden
corners and now as the deep organ note throbbed
behind me and the bowl of light rippled in thrilling
answer trilling piping and little elfish bugle notes fairy
fiddling and little silvery carillon i knew that the sing-
ing ones lay before me and i thought of the words of
him to whom i had gone a child for vengeance upon
the black things of the underworld

  cleon if your judgment falters in the future which
must come heed my advice place your trust in that
which you see as wholly beautiful

  and in the singing ones i found beauty though i had
come to hate and fear all creatures of the mist by reason
of the black things in these there was a purity a
clean virulent airiness that reassured me though of
necessity they must be fundamentally of the stuff of
the mist folk living moving as they perhaps sprung
from the same hidden root i stepped to the brink of
the dais and laid hektor in the glowing flood of light
that lapped at its brink slowly he sank into the rosy
depths where the little threads of silver were clustering
in a scintillant net that dropped softly about him hiding
him from my sight thorvalds hand was on my arm
his voice in my ear and in obedience i also let myself
drop into the pool of light and drift down through the
silent depths weariness and the fatigue of strained
muscles faded away leaving peace and dreamy languor
i was purged of the horror i had seen and felt made
new and clean by the fingers of light that were gently
wafted through my brain and with thorvald at my
side i drifted dreamily to where the little filaments
of coral flame were grouping dancing beckoning
eagerly they surged up about me folded over my
head in a living net of flame and through my body ran
a leaping fire of vibrant energy renovating me charging
me with life and joy and health such as i had not felt
for many years here was the alliance that made gods
of the warriors of thule

  out on the golden dais we were laid thorvald and i
while from the bowl of light came a sad murmur of
ethereal music regretful apologetic up from the pool
swam the globe of silver threadings up to our very feet
it opened like a great bud unfolding and there as in a
cradle nestled hektor sleeping he stirred and woke
but in his eyes was not that which i sought conscious-
ness wras his now and the will to live but not in our
wrorld he moved and saw and felt in some higher
plane in the plane of the black things

  thorvald spoke do not despair o cleon he was
far gone i feared it would be thus-i have seen men so
before after the flame-kiss of the black ones he lives
as we but in their world there is yet a hope cleon
i have seen it-once-applied only in direst extreme if
it should succeed he would be ever such as you see him
now but of these singing ones and free of the black
ones forever i think-they will try it they are very
kind and you must give of your strength willingly


amazing

stories

  hektor rose to his feet stalked past us as in a dream
after him poured the flood of rose light enveloping us
carrying us up with it i saw now the source of the
organ notes those to which the singing ones responded
like a mighty sapphire faceted and jeweled yet of yield-
ing blue glory midway between light and flame it floated
-father ruler god of these singing ones about it
clustered the rose light baring us in its midst forming
a great halo about the blue jewel of flame i touched it
felt it full of a warmth and a great life with infinite
understanding and into my mind came the thought of
that which hektor had destroyed in the crimson city-
perhaps its counterpart in the life of the black vapor
creatures and i had more of sympathy for that race
which had lost its god

  far below on the dais hektor stood like a statue of
marble face upturned to the light now from the sap-
phire globe burst a fountain of silver flame falling in
mist about him then thickening to a rain of flashing silver
that flooded over him from head to foot and there came
a yearning in me a longing to unite my strength and
life with the life of the singing ones pouring them out
in the silver flame that meant life and safety to him be-
low thicker and thicker poured the rain of silver
cascading over him in great waves and sinking into him
then he began to rise from the golden floor and the
silver flood ceased as he drew near and i saw in his
dreaming eyes the presence of the singing ones with
the rose mist he swept from the temple and i stood with
thorvald above the empty bowl watching the life ebb
from the golden hall then all were gone and we went
wearily down the corridor to the hall where the oarsmen
waited

during the days that followed there was little to
do but roam the golden city or gaze over the side
of the mountain at the flood that still roared beneath
thorvald said that a deep narrow channel had been cut
through the mountains and out into the sea how we
could not imagine and that through it the water of the
sea was pouring into the swamp and then into the abyss
but the sea was large and the channel narrow and it
would be long before the men of thule might venture
homeward once more there were many in that golden
city like hektor living as men yet part of that people
of rose light that were the singing ones through
the streets and garden they wandered a great peace and
knowledge in their quiet eyes and i could not but envy
them at times

  i could not but wonder at these folk of light here
even more than in the mist creatures were my three
criteria of perfection in life satisfied in the mist crea-
tures the transformation of energy was efficient far be-
yond all our hopes and dreams but there was always
something artificial about it something of unnatural
strain while here the light had gathered the silver rain
had descended all with perfect spontaneity that was be-
yond my ability to comprehend smooth and effortless as
-light in the black mist there was unity beyond all
leagues of man but the limits of the individual were
still evident one could see the difference at once
in the crimson city the black mist flowed about in isola-
ted gouts of vapor unified only in time of great stress
here the golden walls and paving glowed through a
veiling haze of rose and silver everywhere from lowest
to highest level and ever continuous one with all its

parts yet a people rather than a single creature lastly
the purpose of the things whatever it might be was
at odds with all the world except itself alien to the races
that shared the universe with it but these people of
light were in perfect harmony with the chord that under-
lies nature the basic chord of beauty and symmetry
great or tiny majestic or ethereal that vibrates in
harmony with the fundamentals of space and time
sometimes i felt that they were not merely a single
race but that in them all the other races met in com-
mon sympathy and understanding as one race perhaps
-as life itself

  and i thought of the varied races that i knew-of
man and of the creatures of the outer world that i had
seen birds and insects and brilliant fishes of the great
flesh-hulks of the marshes that my father had shown
to me of the horridly living jungle in the underworld
and last of these two topmost races-the vapor crea-
tures and the singing ones where did all these fit into
the purpose that day by day  man is dragging from the
secrets of the universe how did they fit into the under-
lying unity that must ultimately envelop all things when
man shall have the mind to comprehend it i felt that
these singing ones were closer to it now than we they
did not strive with machines and delicate experiments
to catalogue the universe to name and classify all that
came within their experience for that is the way of
man slowly painstakingly we climbed the steep path
step by faltering step slipping and stumbling halting
to impress every pebble and grain of sand every grass-
blade along the wtay in our memory that when the sum-
mit is at last reached man may stand and look back into
the memory of his race and see all the infinite mosaic of
law and chance that is the pattern of the universe uni-
fied before him so man moves to his ultimate height
and so no other race moves while man lives

  but these folk of light and they of the black vapor
had no machines that man could name so no massive
tomes of data such as man could understand their ways
were different from ours and from each other as are
all ways in my belief both it seemed absorbed the uni-
verse into themselves but not in the same way for
the black things sucked out the life of what they met
destroyed it utterly and horribly while the singing ones
gave life where it was needed out of themselves and
profited and progressed by it how i cannot tell except
that their way was the way of beauty i am old and to
the old comes something of insight and philosophizing
but i am a man and mans way must needs be mine-
the painful halting climb that knows few leaps of all-
enveloping insight i cannot be otherwise though with
hektor-i cannot tell

  for long while the torrent waned beneath the crag
of the golden city i had been awaiting the vengeance
of the black ones come it must and i felt that this
would mark a crisis in their cause for all their race must
needs be flung into the battle strange how a little
thing can break the sway of a mighty race as once tiny
hairy mammals new evolved and untried by time
found welcome food in the buried eggs of those great
reptiles that once ruled the planet and brought that giant
race crashing to the ground in defeat hektor was such
as they

  i had feared the coming of the things yet when that
ominous cloud of black billowed sluggishly down the
narrow gorge i was strangely calm and unconcerned
cleon of yzdral



i felt then that they could not win that it was written
in the equation of their life

  from the topmost turret of the golden city we
watched thorvald and i the oarsmen crowding around
us with flashing eyes to see the battle far below
lining the terraces in silent expectation were those who
like hektor had come under the silver rain above us
all about us enveloping all the city in a glorious haze
of rose light the singing ones floated their voice a
thrilling clamor of bugles presaging victory and up
from the heart of the city blending with their bugling
rose the organ-sorig of the sapphire globe triumphant
and exultant

  now the black ones had encircled the crag with their
dense black clouds and were rising toward the city
and below at the lowest ramparts the halo of light
spread and thickened its rose-flush deepening with the
little darting tongues of thrilling flame in the uneasy
ranks of black the spheres of opalescence were forming
small then swelling into sudden fiery brilliance huger by
far than what i had ever seen they were spinning now
faster and ever faster the wind whining furiously from
their contact and still the rose deepened and i could
see the flickering web of silver that laced its heart

  now the spheres were still tensing for the attack
even beneath the protecting halo of light we felt the
strain tugging at space itself gaining strength from the
deformation of the universe to loose its fusing thunder-
bolts of flame as before it mounted until the mind
seemed drawn to breaking and then the tension snap-
ped and from the myriad opal spheres leapt the tongues-
of searing flame hurtling straight at the guardian halo
crashing against that wall of soft rose light-and van-
ishing faster thicker they came with a sort of frantic
fury now the black mist was gone entirely drawn into
the opal spheres and the place below had become a
maelstrom of battling flame leaping meshing twin-
ing in a tangled maze of fire the fury of the spheres bat-
tered atthe city faster ever faster and more furiously
until the eye could not follow their dancing in the sea
of flame yet the barrier halo of light still clung un-
harmed about the city drinking in the mad fire that ham-
mered in mighty bolts and streamers at its surface dis-
solving them utterly with no sign of stress or battle
save the slow deepening of the rose as the flames poured
into it i cannot say how long the fray went on the
rose had swelled to a burning scarlet shot with great
pulsing arteries of silver when high above us throbbed
the organ note of the sapphire globe imperative com-
manding and in reply the rose mist whispered low
and sweet and far off laughing and triumphant with a
little tingling trill running through the soft soughing
the globe burned with a dazzling blue now and from it
cascaded the torrents of silver light flooding down over
the sea of fire beneath and where it struck the spheres
they dissolved and were gone in a thin green mist that
drifted slowly out over the gorge and they were swal-
lowed up by the leaping spray the black ones were
forever dead

there is little more to tell of the singing ones
once more just before our oars bore us again up
the shallow stream now free of the pouring waters of
the pale sea we bathed in the rose light which was
filling us with the fiery energy that had come from the

black ones slowly up the stream we went and over
the still flooded swamps where drowned and rotting
tree-things were rising from the settling water to a deep
inlet that ran far into the mountains and a great cavern
gaped through to the pale sea over the level cavern
floor we bore the dragon ship pushed on rollers by the
oarsmen and down the sloping wave-worn bed of the
sea to the restless waters skirting the rocky shore we
passed the channel that had been burned into the black
rock beneath the shattered crystal valve under luda
the luminous white water still lipping into its smooth
groove then we struck straight out into the pale sea
whose lowering roof came slowly down as though to
crush us until we rowed blindly through the clinging
mists that blanketed the waters with weird fire now
and again some monster of long-gone time broke the sur-
face throwing up a luminous spray toward the flashng
clouds by what reckoning what instinct we were
guided i cannot tell but after many weary hours the
rocky walls of the cavern closed in  either hand to a
high-walled narrow fjord running back mile on mile into
the heart of the cliff then opening into the vaulted
cavern of the men of thule

  about the shores of a quiet lagoon clustered the low
thatched homes of stone where lived the race of thor-
vald before each hall drawn high on the pebbled
beach lay a dragon ship marked with the shield of the
clan which dwelt in the granite hall beyond up from
the cluster of houses ran waving upland meadows of
wheat and rye while green forests showed beyond
gnarled and leafy they ran up the flanks of the great
fi re-mountain which gave light to this new thule its
time-worn precipices aflame with a white-hot river
of molten rock flowing in great cascades to finally pour
into the bowels of the planet through a great oval pit
above the little city here among the kinsmen of thor-
vald in his high-raftered hall of granite i lived and
hunted with them the strange beasts of the land beyond
the fiery mountain beasts such as the old books tell of
mountains of flesh with long recurving tusks and great
flailing trunks smaller beasts with horns upon their
snouts and little red eyes great dun cats with sword-
like teeth-things that had been in thule in the days of
the first planet when men first fought there

  but at last i grew weary and longed to see again the
lands of the surface yzdral and kor and thula with
thorvald for guide and ten brawny men of thule to
aid us we went up and through shadowy caverns of
crystal where no life was save ourselves more than a
year we climbed fed by the stores hid long ago by the
forefathers race food preserved in the cunning way of
thule the way was steep and smooth smoothed by
the hand of man in ages past and here and there stone
bridges spanned a chasm or bronze ladders scaled the
vertical precipice of a mighty fault or strong gates
barred the way i recognized here the hand of that
prince of quetzal who reared the inner cities for the
banished people of atlantis and gave aid to them of
thule who were his friends

  and then the inner caverns not far from squat kor
of the lava-plain we emerged from the chasm that
marked the end of the way and in that dead dust-
silenced city found an aero to carry us to the surface
as one long dead thula greeted me and thorvald as a
dream of the past even as he had feasted me in thule

the jameson
satellite

by neil r jones

rpile mammoths of the ancient world have been wonderfully preserved in the
jl ice of siberia the cold only a few miles out into space will be far more
intense than in the polar regions and its power for preserving the dead body
therefore would most probably be correspondingly enhanced when the hero-
scientist in this story knew he must die he conceived a brilliant idea for the
preservation of his body the result of which even exceeded his expectations
what how and why are cleverly told here

illustrated by morey

prologue
the rocket satellite

in the depths of space some twenty thousand miles
from the earth the body of professor jameson
within its rocket container cruised upon an end-
less journey circling the great sphere the rogket
was a satellite of the huge revolving world around
which it held to its orbit in the year  professor
jameson had sought a plan whereby he might preserve
his body indefinitely after his death he had worked
long and hard upon the subject

  since the time of the pharaohs the human race had
looked for a means by which the dead might be preserved
against the ravages of time great had been the art of
the egyptians in the embalming of their deceased a
practice which was later lost to humanity of the ensuing
mechanical age never to be rediscovered but even
the embalming of the egyptians so professor jameson
had argued would be futile in the face of millions of
years the dissolution of the corpses being just as
eventual as immediate cremation following death

  the professor had looked for a means by which the
body could be preserved perfectly forever but eventu-
ally he had come to the conclusion that nothing on earth
is unchangeable beyond a certain limit of time just as

long as he sought an earthly means of preservation he
was doomed to disappointment all earthly elements are
composed of atoms which are forever breaking down and
building up but never destroying themselves a match
may be burned but the atoms are still unchanged hav-
ing resolved themselves into smoke carbon dioxide
ashes and certain basic elements it was clear to the
professor that he could never accomplish his purpose if
he were to employ one system of atomic structure such
as embalming fluid or other concoction to preserve an-
other system of atomic structure such as the human
body when all atomic structure is subject to universal
change no matter how slow

  he had then soliloquized upon the possibility of pre-
serving the human body in its state of death until the end
of all earthly time-to that day when the earth would re-
turn to the sun from which it had sprung quite sud-
denly one day he had conceived the answer to the puz-
zling problem which obsessed his mind leaving him awed
with its wild uncanny potentialities

  he would have his body shot into space enclosed in a
rocket to become a satellite of the earth as long as the
earth continued to exist he reasoned logically any
material substance whether of organic or inorganic
origin cast into the depths of space would exist indefi-
nitely he had visualized his dead body enclosed in a
rocket flying off into the illimitable maw of space he

would remain in perfect preservation while on earth
millions of generations of mankind would live and die
their bodies to molder into the dust of the forgotten
past he would exist in this unchanged manner until

 fade out forever in the chill thin atmosphere of a dy-
 ing world and still his body would remain intact and
 as perfect in its rocket container as on the day of the
 far-gone past when it had left the earth to be hurled out
 on its career what a magnificent idea

    at first he had been assailed with doubts suppose his
 funeral rocket landed upon another planet or drawn by
 the pull of the great sun were thrown into the flaming
 folds of the incandescent sphere the rocket might con-
 tinue on out of the solar system plunging through the
 endless seas of space for millions of years to finally
 enter the solar system of some far off star as meteors
 often enter ours suppose his rocket crashed upon a
 planet or the star itself or became a captive satellite
 of some celestial body

    it had been at this juncture that the idea of his rocket
 becoming the satellite of the earth had presented it-
 self and he had immediately incorporated it into his
 scheme the professor had figured out the amount of
 radium necessary to carry the rocket far enough away
 from the earth so that it would not turn around and
 crash and still be not so far away but what the earths
 gravitational attraction would keep it from leaving the
 vicinity of the earth and the solar system like the
 moon it would forever revolve around the earth

    he had chosen an orbit sixty-five thousand miles from
 the earth for his rocket to follow the only fears he had
 entertained concerned the huge meteors which careened
 through space at tremendous rates of speed he had
 overcome this obstacle however and had eliminated
 the possibilities of a collision with these stellar jugger-
 nauts in the rocket were installed radium repulsion
 rays which swerved all approaching meteors from the
 path of the rocket as they entered the vicinity of the
 space wanderer

   the aged professor had prepared for every con-
 tingency and had set down to rest from his labors rev-
 elling in the stupendous unparalleled results he would
 obtain never would his body undergo decay never
 would his bones bleach to return to the dust of the earth
 from which all men originally came and to which they
 must return his body would remain millions of years
 in a perfectly preserved state untouched by the hoary
 palm of such time as only geologists and astronomers
 can conceive

    his efforts would surpass even the wildest dreams of
 h rider haggard who depicted the wondrous embalm-
 ing practices of the ancient nation of kor in his im-
 mortal novel she wherein holly under the escort
 of the incomparable ayesha looked upon the magnifi-
 cent lifelike masterpieces of embalming by the long gone
 peoples of kor

    with the assistance of a nephew who carried out his
 instructions and wishes following his death professor
 jameson was sent upon his pilgrimage into space within
 the rocket he himself had built the nephew and heir
 kept the secret forever locked in his heart

 generation after generation had passed upon
 its way gradually humanity had come to die out
 finally disappearing from the earth altogether man-

 kind was later replaced by various other forms of life
 which dominated the globe for their allotted spaces of
 time before they too became extinct the years piled
 up on one another running into millions and still the
 baxxyte yept its oney vigil around the eartyi
 gradually closing the distance between satellite anc
 planet yielding reluctantly to the latters powerful attrac
 tion

    forty million years later its orbit ranged some twent
  thousand miles from the earth while the dead worl
  edged ever nearer the cooling sun whose dull red bal
  covered a large expanse of the sky surrounding th
  flaming sphere many of the stars could be perceive
  through the earths thin rarefied atmosphere as th
  earth cut in slowly and gradually toward the solar lumin
  ary so was the moon revolving ever nearer the earth
  appearing like a great gem in the twilight sky

    the rocket containing the remains of professor jame
 son continued its endless travel around the great ball o
 the earth whose rotation had now ceased entirely-oin
 side forever facing the dying sun there it pursued it
 lonely way a cosmic coffin accompanied by its funera
 cortege of scintillating stars amid the deep silence of th
 eternal space which enshrouded it solitary it remained
 except for the occasional passing of a meteor flitting b
 at a remarkable speed on its aimless journey through th
 vacuum between worlds

    would the satellite follow its orbit to the worlds end
  or would its supply of radium soon exhaust itself afte
  so many eons of time converting the rocket into the pre
  of the first large meteor which chanced that way woul
  it some day return to the earth as its nearer approacl
  portended and increase its acceleration in a long arc t
  crash upon the surface of the dead planet and whei
  the rocket terminated its career would the body of pro
  fessor jameson be found perfectly preserved or mereh
  a crumbled mound of dust

chapter i

 years after

 e entering within the boundaries of the solai
 system a long dark pointed craft sped across
  the realms of space towards the tiny point of lighl
 which marked the dull red ball of the dying sun whict
 would some day lie cold and dark forever like a huge
 meteor it flashed into the solar system from anothet
 chain of planets far out in the illimitable universe oi
 stars and worlds heading towards the great red sun at an
 inconceivable speed

  within the interior of the space traveler queer crea-
tures of metal labored at the controls of the space flyer
which juggernauted on its way towards the far off
solar luminary rapidly it crossed the orbits of nep-
 tune and uranus and headed sunward the bodies of
these queer creatures were square blocks of a metal
closely resembling steel while for appendages the metal
cube was upheld by four jointed legs capable of move-
ment a set of six tentacles all metal like the rest of the
body curved outward from the upper half of the cubic
body surmounting it was a queer shaped head rising
to a peak in the center and equipped with a circle of
eyes all the way around the head the creatures with
their mechanical eyes equipped with metal shutters could
see in all directions a single eye pointed directly up-
the jameson satellite



  ward being situated in the apex of the peaked head
resting in a slight depression of the cranium

  these were the zoromes of the planet zor which ro-
tated on its way around a star millions of light years dis-
tant from our solar system the zoromes several hun-
dred thousand years before had reached a stage in
science where they searched for immortality and eternal
relief from bodily ills and various deficiencies of flesh and
blood anatomy they had sought freedom from death
and had found it but at the same time they had destroyed
the propensities for birth for several hundred thousand
years there had been no births and few deaths in the
history of the zoromes

  this strange race of people had built these mechanical
bodies and by operation upon one another had removed
their brains to the metal heads from which they directed
the functions and movements of their inorganic anato-
mies there had been no deaths due to worn out bodies
when one part of the mechanical men wore out it was
replaced by a new part and so the zoromes continued
living their immortal lives which saw few casualties
it was true that since the innovation of the machines
there had been a few accidents which had seen the de-
struction of the metal heads with their brains these
were irreparable such cases had been few however
and the population of zor had decreased but little the
machine men of zor had no use for atmosphere and
had it not been for the terrible coldness of space could
have just as well existed in the ether void as upon some
planet their metal bodies especially their metal encased
brains required a certain amount of heat even though
they were able to exist comfortably in temperatures
which would instantly have frozen to death a flesh-and-
blood creature

  the most popular pastime among the machine men of
zor was the exploration of the universe this afforded
them a never ending source of interest in the discovery
of the variegated inhabitants and conditions of the vari-
ous planets on which they came to rest hundreds of
space ships were sent out in all directions many of them
being upon their expeditions for hundreds of years be-
fore they returned once more to the home planet of far
off zor

  this particular space craft of the zoromes had entered
the solar system whose planets were gradually circling
in closer to the dull red ball of the declining sun several
of the machine men of the space crafts crew which num-
bered some fifty individuals were examining the various
planets of this particular planetary system carefully
through telescopes possessing an immense power

  these machine men had no names and were indexed
according to letters and numbers they conversed by
means of thought impulses and were neither capable of
making a sound vocally nor of hearing one uttered

  where shall we go queried one of the men at the
controls questioning another who stood by his side ex-
amining a chart on the wall

  they all appear to be dead worlds r- replied
the one addressed but the second planet from the sun
appears to have an atmosphere which might sustain
a few living creatures and the third planet may also
prove interesting for it has a satellite we shall examine
the inner planets first of all and explore the outer ones
later if we decide it is worth the time

  too much trouble for nothing ventured g-
this system of planets offers us little but what we have

  seen many times before in our travels the sun is so
cooled that it cannot sustain the more common life on
its planets the type of life forms we usually find in our
travels we should have visited a planetary system
with a brighter sun

  you speak of common life remarked sx-
what of the uncommon life have we not found life
existent on cold dead planets with no sunlight and at-
mosphere at all

  yes we have admitted g- but such occasions
are exceedingly rare

  the possibility exists however even in this case
reminded r-s and what if we do spend a bit of
unprofitable time in this planetary system-havent we
all an endless lifetime before us eternity is ours
we shall visit the second planet first of all directed
x- who was in charge of this particular expedi-
tion of the zoromes and on the way there we shall
cruise along near the third planet to see what we can
of the surface we may be able to tell whether or not
it holds anything of interest for us if it does after
visiting the second planet we shall return to the third
the first world is not worth bothering about

the space ship from zor raced on in a direction
which would take it several thousand miles above
the earth and then on to the planet which we know as
venus as the space ship rapidly neared the earth it
slackened its speed so that the zoromes might examine
it closely with their glasses as the ship passed the third
planet

  suddenly one of the machine men ran excitedly into
the room where x- stood watching the topography
of the world beneath him

  we have found something he exclaimed

  what

  another space ship

  where

  but a short distance ahead of us on our course come
into the forepart of the ship and you can pick it up with
the glass

  which way is it going asked x-

  it is behaving queerly replied the machine man
of zor it appears to be in the act of circling the
planet

  do you suppose that there really is life on that dead
world-intelligent beings like ourselves and that this is
one of their space craft

  perhaps it is another exploration craft like our own
from some other world was the suggestion

  but not of ours said x-

together the two zoromes hastened into the obser-
vation room of the space ship where more of the ma-
chine men were excitedly examining the mysterious
space craft their thought impulses flying thick and fast
it is very small

  its speed is slow

  the craft can hold but few men observed one
we do not yet know of what size the creatures are
reminded another perhaps there are thousands of
them in that space craft out there they may be of such
a small size that it will be necessary to look twice
before finding one of them

  we shall soon overtake it and see

  i wonder if they have seen us

  where do you suppose it came from


amazing stories

  from the world beneath us was the suggestion
  perhaps

chapter ii

the mysterious space craft

the machine men made way for their leader
x- who regarded the space craft ahead of
them critically

  have you tried communicating with it yet he
asked

  there is no reply to any of our signals came the
answer

  come alongside of it then ordered the commander
it is small enough to be brought inside our carrying
compartment and we can see with our penetration rays
just what manner of creatures it holds they are in-
telligent that is certain for their space ship implies as
much

  the space flyer of the zoromes slowed up as it ap-
proached the mysterious wanderer of the cosmic void
which hovered in the vicinity of the dying world

  what a queer shape it has remarked x- it
is even smaller than i had previously calculated

  a rare occurrence had taken place among the machine
men of zor they were overcome by a great curiosity
which they could not allow to remain unsatiated ac-
customed as they were to witnessing strange sights and
stranger creatures meeting up with weird adventures in
various corners of the universe they had become hard-
ened to the usual run of experiences which they were
in the habit of encountering it took a great deal to
arouse their unperturbed attitudes something however
about this queer space craft had gripped their imagina-
tions and perhaps a subconscious influence asserted to
their minds that here they were to come across an ad-
venture radically unusual

  come alongside it repeated x- to the operator
as he returned to the control room and gazed through
the side of the space ship in the direction of the smaller
cosmic wanderer

  im trying to replied the machine man but it
seems to jump away a bit every time i get within a
certain distance of it our ship seems to jump back-
ward a bit too

  are they trying to elude us

  i dont know they should pick up more speed if
that is their object

  perhaps they are now progressing at their maximum
speed and cannot increase their acceleration any more

  look exclaimed the operator did you see that
the thing jumped away from us again

  our ship moved also said x- i saw a flash
of light shoot from the side of the other craft as it
jumped

  another machine man now entered and spoke to the
commander of the zorome expedition

  they are using radium repellent rays to keep us from
approaching he informed

  counteract it instructed x-

  the man left and now the machine man at the controls
of the craft tried again to close with the mysterious
wanderer of the space between planets the effort was
successful and this time there was no glow of repulsion
rays from the side of the long metal cylinder

  they now entered the compartment where various
objects were transferred from the depths of space to the
interplanetary craft patiently they waited for the rest
of the machine men to open the side of their space ship
and bring in the queer elongated cylinder

  put it under the penetration ray ordered x-
then we shall see what it contains

  the entire group of zoromes were assembled about
the long cylinder whose nickel-plated sides shone bril-
liantly with interest they regarded the fifteen-foot
object which tapered a bit towards it base the nose was
pointed like a bullet eight cylindrical protuberances
were affixed to the base while the four sides were
equipped with fins such as are seen on aerial bombs to
guide them in a direct unswerving line through the
atmosphere at the base of the strange craft there pro-
jected a lever while in one side was a door which appar-
ently opened outward one of the machine men reached
forward to open it but was halted by the admonition
of the commander

  do not open it yet he warned we are not aware
of what it contains

  guided by the hand of one of the machine men a
series of lights shone down upon the cylinder it be-
came enveloped in a haze of light which rendered the
metal sides of the mysterious space craft dim and
indistinct while the interior of the cylinder was as clearly
revealed as if there had been no covering the machine
men expecting to see at least several perhaps many
strange creature moving about within the cylinder stared
aghast at the sight they beheld there was but one crea-
ture and he was lying perfectly still either in a state
of suspended animation or else of death he was about
twice the height of the mechanical men of zor for a
long time they gazed at him in silence of thought and
then their leader instructed them

  take him out of the container

  the penetration rays were turned off and two of the
machine men stepped eagerly forward and opened the
door one of them peered within at the recumbent body
of the weird looking individual with the four appendages
the creature lay against a luxuriously upholstered in-
terior a strap affixed to his chin while four more straps
held both the upper and lower appendages securely to
the insides of the cylinder the machine man released
these and with the help of his comrade removed the
body of the creature from the cosmic coffin in which they
had found it

  he is dead pronounced one of the machine men
after a careful examination of the corpse he has been
like this for a long time

  there are strange thought impressions left upon his
mind remarked another

  one of the machine men whose metal body was of a
different shade than that of his companions stepped for-
ward his cubic body bent over that of the strange crea-
ture who wras garbed in fantastic accoutrements he
examined the dead organism a moment and then turned
to his companions

  would you like to hear his story he asked
  yes came the concerted reply

  you shall then was the ultimatum bring him
into my laboratory i shall remove his brain and stimu-
late the cells into activity once more we shall give him
life again transplanting his brain into the head of one of
our machines
the jameson satellite



  with these words he directed two of the zoromes to
carry the corpse into the laboratory

  as the space ship cruised about in the vicinity of this
third planet which x- had decided to visit on find-
ing the metal cylinder with its queer inhabitant b-
the experimenter worked unceasingly in his laboratory
to revive the long dead brain cells to action once more
finally after consummating his desires and having his
efforts crowned with success he placed the brain within
the head of a machine the brain was brought to con-
sciousness the creatures dead body was discarded after
the all-important brain had been removed

chapter iii

recalled to life

as professor jameson came to himself he was
aware of a strange feeling he was sick the

-	doctors had not expected him to live they had
frankly told him so-but he had cared little in view of
the long happy years stretched out behind him perhaps
he was not to die yet he wondered how long he had
slept how strange he felt-as if he had no body
why couldnt he open his eyes he tried very hard
a mist swam before him his eyes had been open all
the time but he had not seen before that was queer he
ruminated all was silent about his bedside had all the
doctors and nurses left him to sleep-or to die

  devil take that mist which swam before him obscur-
ing everything in line of vision he would call his
nephew vainly he attempted to shout the word doug-
las but to no avail where was his mouth it seemed
as if he had none was it all delirium the strange
silence-perhaps he had lost his sense of hearing along
with his ability to speak-and he could see nothing dis-
tinctly the mist had transferred itself into a confused
jumble of indistinct objects some of which moved about
before him

  he was now conscious of some impulse in his mind
which kept questioning him as to how he felt he was
conscious of other strange ideas which seemed to be
impressed upon his brain but this one thought concern-
ing his indisposition clamored insistently over the lesser
ideas it seemed just as if someone was addressing him
and impulsively he attempted to utter a sound and tell
them how queer he felt it seemed as if speech had been
taken from him he could not talk no matter how hard
he tried it was no use strange to say however the
impulse within his mind appeared to be satisfied with
the effort and now put another question to him where
was he from what a strange question when he was at
home he told them as much had he always lived
there why of course

  the aged professor was now becoming more astute
to his conditions at first it was only a mild passive
wonderment at his helplessness and the strange thoughts
which raced through his mind now he attempted to
arouse himself from the lethargy

  quite suddenly his sight cleared and what a surprise
he could see all the way around him without moving
his head and he could look at the ceiling of his room
his room was it his room no-it couldnt be
where was he  what were those queer machines before
him they moved on four legs six tentacles curled
outward from their cubical bodies one of the machines

stood close before him a tentacle shot out from the
object and rubbed his head how strange it felt upon
his brow instinctively he obeyed the impulse to shove
the contraption of metal from him with his hands

  his arms did not rise instead six tentacles projected
upward to force back the machine professor jameson
gasped mentally in surprise as he gazed at the result of
his urge to push the strange unearthly looking machine-
caricature from him with trepidation he looked down at
his own body to see where the tentacles had come from
and his surprise turned to sheer fright and amazement
his body was like the moving machine which stood be-
fore him where was he what had ever happened to
him so suddenly only a few moments ago he had been
in his bed with the doctors and his nephew bending over
him expecting him to die the last words he had re-
membered hearing was the cryptic announcement of one
of the doctors

  he is going now

  but he hadnt died after all apparently a horrible
thought suddenly struck him was this the life after
death  or was it an illusion of the mind  he became
aware that the machine in front of him was attempting
to communicate something to him how could it thought
the professor when he had no mouth the machine
walked nearer on its four legs was it alive  its desire
to communicate an idea to him became more insistent
the suggestion of the machines question was in his
mind telepathy thought he

  the creature was asking him about the place whence
he had come he didnt know his mind was in such a
turmoil of thoughts and conflicting ideas he allowed
himself to be led to a window where the machine with
waving tentacle pointed towards an object outside it
was a queer sensation to be walking on the four metal
legs he looked from the window and saw that which
caused him to nearly drop over so astounded was he

  the professor found himself gazing from the bound-
less depths of space across the cosmic void to where a
huge planet lay quiet now he was sure it was an illusion
which made his mind and sight behave so queerly he
was troubled by a strange dream carefully he examined
the topography of the gigantic globe which rested off in
the distance at the same time he could see back of him
the concourse of mechanical creatures crowding up be-
hind him and was aware of a telepathic conversation
which wras being carried on behind him-or before him
which was it eyes extended all the way around his
head while there existed no difference on any of the four
sides of his cubed body his mechanical legs were
capable of moving in any of four given directions with
perfect ease he discovered

  the planet was not the earth-of that he was sure
none of the familiar continents lay before his eyes
and then he saw the great red ball of the dying sun
that was not the sun of his earth it had been a great
deal more brilliant

  did you come from that planet came the thought
impulse from the mechanism by his side

  no he returned

  he then allowed the machine men-for he assumed
that they were machine men-and reasoned that some-
how or other they had by some marvelous transformation
made him over just as they were to lead him through
the craft of which he now took notice for the first time
it was an interplanetary flyer or space ship he believed


amazing stories

  x- now took him to the compartment where they
had removed him from the strange container they had
found wandering in the vicinity of the nearby world
there they showed him the long cylinder

  my rocket satellite exclaimed professor jameson
to himself though in reality every one of the machine
men received his thoughts plainly what is it doing
here 

  we found your dead body within it stated x-
your brain was removed to the machine after having
been stimulated into activity once more your carcass
was thrown away

  professor jameson stood dumbfounded by the words
of the machine man

  so i did die exclaimed the professor and my
body was placed within the rocket to remain in ever-
lasting preservation until the end of all earthly time
success i have attained unrivalled success

  he then turned to the machine man

  how long have i been that way he asked excitedly
how should we know replied the zorome we
picked up your rocket only a short time ago which
according to your computation would be less than a day
this is our first visit to your planetary system and we
chanced upon your rocket so it is a satellite we
didnt watch it long enough to discover whether or not
it was a satellite at first we thought it to be another
traveling space craft but when it refused to answer our
signals we investigated

  and that was the earth at which i looked mused
the professor no wonder i didnt recognize it the
topography has changed so much how different the
sun appears-it must have been over a million years ago
when i died

  many millions corrected x- suns of such
size as this one do not cool in so short a time as you
suggest

  professor jameson in spite of all his amazing com-
putations before his death was staggered by the reality
who are you he suddenly asked

  we are the zoromes from zor a planet of a sun
far across the universe

  x- then went on to tell professor jameson some-
thing about how the zoromes had attained their high
stage of development and had instantly put a stop to all
birth evolution and death of their people by becoming
machine men

chapter iv
the dying world

nd now tell us of yourself said x- and
about your world

  professor jameson noted in college as a lec-
turer of no mean ability and perfectly capable of relating
intelligently to them the story of the earths history
evolution and march of events following the birth of
civilization up until the time when he died began his
story the mental speech hampered him for a time but
he soon became accustomed to it so as to use it easily
and he found it preferable to vocal speech after a while
the zoromes listened interestedly to the account until
professor jameson had finished

  my nephew concluded the professor evidently
obeyed my instructions and placed my body in the rocket

an

 i had built shooting it out into space where i became
 the satellite of the earth for these many millions of
 years

 do you really want to know how long you were dead
 before we found you  asked x- it would be in-
 teresting to find out

 yes i should like very much to know replied the
 professor

 our greatest mathematician -c- will tell you
 the mathematician stepped forward upon one side of
 his cube were many buttons arranged in long columns
 and squares

 what is your unit of measuring he asked

 a mile

 how many times more is a mile than the length of
 your rocket satellite

 my rocket is fifteen feet long a mile is five thou-
 sand two hundred and eighty feet

 the mathematician depressed a few buttons 

 how far or how many miles from the sun was your
 planet at that time 

 ninety-three million miles was the reply

 and your worlds satellite which you call moon from
 your planet earth

 two hundred and forty thousand miles

 and your rocket 

 i figured it to go about sixty-five thousand miles from
 the earth

 it was only twenty thousand miles from the earth
 when we picked you up said the mathematician de-
 pressing a few more buttons the moon and sun are
 also much nearer your planet now

 professor jameson gave way to a mental ejaculation
 of amazement

do you know how long you have cruised around
the planet in your satellite said the mathematician
since you began that journey the planet which you
call the earth has revolved around the sun over forty
million times

forty-million-years exclaimed professor jame-
son haltingly humanity must have perished from the
earth long ago im the last man on earth

 it is a dead world interjected x-

 of course elucidated the mathematician those
 last few million years are much shorter than the ones
 in which you lived the earths orbit is of less diameter
 and its speed of revolution is greatly increased due to
 its proximity to the cooling sun i should say that your
 year was some four times as long as the time in which
 it now takes the planet to circumnavigate the sun
 how many days were there in your year

 three hundred and sixty-five

 the planet has now ceased rotating entirely

 it seems queer that your rocket satellite should avoid
 the meteors so long observed c- the mathe-
 matician

automatic radium repulsion rays explained the
professor

 the very same rays which kept us from approaching
 your rocket stated x- until we neutralized
 them

 you died and were shot out into space long before
 life occurred on zor soliloquized one of the machine
 men our people had not yet been born when yours
 had probably disappeared entirely from the face of the
 earth
the jameson satellite



  hearken to n- said x- he is our
philosopher and loves to dwell on the past life of zor
when we were flesh and blood creatures with the threat
of death hanging always over our heads at that time
like the life you knew we were born we lived and died
all within a very short time comparatively

  of course time has come to mean nothing to us
especially when we are out in space observed n-
we never keep track of it on our expeditions even
though back in zor such accounts are accurately kept
by the way do you know how long we stood here
while you recounted to us the history of your planet
our machine bodies never get tired you know
well ruminated professor jameson giving a gen-
erous allowance of time i should say about a half a
day though it seemed scarcely as long as that

  we listened to you for four days replied n-
  professor jameson was aghast

  really i hadnt meant to be such a bore he
apologized

  that is nothing replied the other your story
was interesting and had it been twice as long it would
not have mattered nor would it have seemed any longer
time is merely relative and in space actual time does
not exist at all any more than your forty million years
cessation of life seemed more than a few moments to
you we saw that it was so when your first thought
impressions reached us following your revival

  let us continue on to your planet earth said
x- perhaps we shall find more startling dis-
closures there

  as the space ship of the zoromes approached the
sphere from which professor jameson had been hurled
in his rocket forty million years before the professor
wondered how the earth would appear and what radical
changes he would find already he knew that the
geographical conditions of the various continents were
changed he had seen as much from the space ship

  a short time later the earth was reached the space
travelers from zor as well as professor jameson
emerged from the cosmic flyer to walk upon the surface
of the planet the earth had ceased rotating leaving one-
half its surface turned always toward the sun this side
of the earth was heated to a considerable degree while
its antipodes turned always away from the solar lumi-
nary was a cold frigid desolate waste the space
travelers from zor did not dare to advance very far into
either hemisphere but landed on the narrow thousand-
mile strip of territory separating the earths frozen half
from its sun-baked antipodes

  as professor jameson emerged from the space ship
with x- he stared in awe at the great transforma-
tion four hundred thousand centuries had wrought
the earths surface its sky and the sun were all so
changed and unearthly appearing off tothe east the
blood red ball of the slowly cooling sun rested upon the
horizon lighting up the eternal day the earths rota-
tion had ceased entirely and it hung motionless in the
sky as it revolved around its solar parent its orbit
slowly but surely cutting in towards the great body of
the sun the two inner planets mercury and venus
wrere now very close to the blood red orb whose scintil-
lating dazzling brilliance had been lost in its cooling
process soon the two nearer planets would succumb to
the great pull of the solar luminary and return to the
flaming folds from which they had been hurled out as

gaseous bodies in the dim age-old past when their ca-
reers had just begun

  the atmosphere was nearly gone so rarefied had it
become and through it professor jameson could view
with amazing clarity without discomfort to his eyes the
bloated body of the dying sun it appeared many times
the size he had seen it at the time of his death on ac-
count of its relative nearness the earth had advanced
a great deal closer to the great star around which it
swung

  the sky towards the west was pitch black except for
the irridescent twinkle of the fiery stars which studded
that section of the heavens as he watched a faint
glow suffused the western sky gradually growing
brighter until like a great gem inlaid in the velvety
blackness the full moon majestically lifted itself above
the horizon casting its pale ethereal radiance upon the
dying world beneath it was increased to many times
the size professor jameson had ever seen it during his
natural lifetime the earths greater attraction was
drawing upon the moon just as the sun was pulling the
earth ever nearer itself

  this cheerless landscape confronting the professor
represented the state of existence to which the earth had
come it was a magnificent spread of loneliness which
bore no witness to the fact that it had seen the teeming
of life in better ages long ago the weird yet beautiful
scene spread in a melancholy panorama before his eyes
drove his thoughts into gloomy abstraction with its dis-
mal depressing influence its funereal oppressive as-
pect smote him suddenly with the chill of a terrible
loneliness

  x- aroused professor jameson from his lethar-
gic reverie let us walk around and see what we can
find i can understand how you feel in regard to the
past it is quite a shock-but it must happen to all
worlds sooner or later-even to zor when that time
comes the zoromes will find a new planet on which to
live if you travel with us you will become accustomed
to the sight of seeing dead lifeless worlds as well as
new and beautiful ones pulsating with life and energy
of course this world being your own holds a peculiar
sentimental value to you but it is really one planet
among billions

  professor jameson was silent

  i wonder whether or not there are any ruins to be
found queried sx-

  i dont believe so replied the professor i remem-
ber hearing an eminent scientist of my day state that
given fifty thousand years every structure and other
creation of man would be obliterated entirely from the
earths surface

  and he was right endorsed the machine man of
zor time is a great effacer

  for a long time the machine men wandered over the
dreary surface of the earth and then x- sug-
gested a change of territory to explore in the space
ship they moved around the earth to the other side still
keeping to the belt of shadowland which completely en-
circled the globe like some gigantic ring where they
now landed arose a series of cones with hollow peaks

  volcanoes exclaimed the professor

  extinct ones added the machine tnan

  leaving the space ship the fifty or more machine men
including professor jameson were soon exploring the
curiously shaped peaks the professor in his wanderings


amazing stories

had strayed away from the rest and now advanced
down into one of the cup-like depressions of the peak
out of sight of his companions the zoromes

chapter v
eternity or death

he was well in the center of the cavity when the
ground beneath him gave way suddenly and he
catapulted below into the darkness through
the stygian gloom he fell in what seemed to be an end-
less drop he finally crashed upon something hard
the thin crust of the volcanos mouth had broken
through precipitating him into the deep hollow in-
terior

  it must have been a long ways to fall-or so it had
seemed why was he not knocked senseless or killed
then he felt himself over carefully with three tentacles
his metal legs were four broken twisted masses of
metal while the lower half of his cubic body was jammed
out of shape and split he could not move and half of
his six tentacles were paralyzed

  how would he ever get out of there he wondered
the machine men of zor might never find him what
would happen to him then he would remain in this
deathless monotonous state forever in the black hole of
the volcanos interior unable to move what a horrible
thought he could not starve to death eating was un-
known among the zoromes the machines requiring no
food he could not even commit suicide the only
way for him to die would be to smash the strong metal
head and in his present immovable condition this was
impossible

  it suddenly occurred to him to radiate thoughts for
help would the zoromes receive his messages he
wondered how far the telepathic messages would carry
he concentrated the powers of his mind upon the call
for help and repeatedly stated his position and plight
he then left his mind clear to receive the thought
answers of the zoromes he received none again
he tried still he received no welcoming answer pro-
fessor jameson became dejected

  it was hopeless the telepathic messages had not
reached the machine men of zor they were too far
away just as one person may be out of earshot of
anothers voice he was doomed to a terrible fate of
existence it were better that his rocket had never
been found he wished that the zoromes had de-
stroyed him instead of bringing him back to life-back
to this

  his thoughts were suddenly broken in upon

  were coming

  dont give up hope

  if the professors machine body had been equipped
with a heart jt would have sung for joy at these wel-
come thought impressions a short time later there ap-
peared in the ragged break of the volcanos mouth
where he had fallen through the metal head of one of
the machine men

  we shall have you out of there soon he said

  the professor never knew how they managed it for
he lost consciousness under some strange ray of light
they projected down upon him in his prison when he
came to consciousness once more it was to find himself
inside the space ship

  if you had fallen and smashed your head it would
have been all over with you were the first thought im-
pulses which greeted him as it is however we can
fix you up first rate

  why didnt you answer the first time i called to
you asked the professor didnt you hear me

  we heard you and we answered but you didnt
hear us you see your brain is different than ours and
though you can send thought waves as far as we can
you cannot receive them from such a great distance
im wrecked said the professor gazing at his
twisted limbs paralyzed tentacles and jammed body

  we shall repair you came the reply it is your
good fortune that your head was not crushed

  what are you going to do with me queried the
professor will you remove my brains to another
machine 

  no that isnt necessary we shall merely remove
our head and place it upon another machine body

  the zoromes immediately set to work upon the task
and soon had professor jamesons metal head removed
from the machine which he had wrecked in his fall
down the crater all during the painless operation the
professor kept up a series of thought exchanges in con-
versation with the zoromes and it seemed but a short
time before his head surmounted a new machine and
he was ready for further exploration in the course of
his operation the space ship had been moved to a new
position and now as they emerged x- kept com-
pany with professor jameson

  i must keep an eye on you he said you will be
getting into more trouble before you get accustomed to
the metal bodies

  but professor jameson was doing a great deal of
thinking doubtlessly these strange machine men who
had picked up his rocket in the depths of space and
had brought him back to life were expecting him to
travel with them and become adopted into the ranks of
the zoromes did he want to go with them he
couldnt decide pie had forgotten that the machine men
could read his innermost thoughts

  you wish to remain here alone upon the earth asked
x- it is your privilege if you really want it so
i dont know replied professor jameson truthfully
he gazed at the dust around his feet it had probably
been the composition of men and had changed from
time to time into various other atomic structures of other
queer forms of life which had succeeded mankind it
was the lav of the atom which never died and now he
had within his power perpetual existence he could be
immortal if he wished it would be an immortality of
never-ending adventures in the vast endless universe
among the galaxy of stars and planets

  a great loneliness seized him would he be happy
among these machine men of another far-off world-
among the zoromes they were kindly and solicitous
of his welfare what better fate could he expect still
a longing for his own kind arose in him-the call of hu-
manity it was irresistible what could he do was
it not in vain humanity had long since disappeared
from the earth-millions of years ago he wondered
what lay beyond the pales of death-real death where
the body decomposed and wasted away to return to the
dust of the earth and assume new atomic structures

  he had begun to wonder whether or not he had been
dead all these forty millions of years-suppose he had
the jameson satellite



been merely in a state of suspended animation he had
remembered a scientist of his day who had claimed that
the body does not die at the point of official death ac-
cording to the claims of this man the cells of the body
did not die at the moment at which respiration heart
beats and blood circulation ceased but existed in the
semblance of life for several days afterward especially
in the cells of the bones which died last of all

  perhaps when he had been sent out into space in his
rocket right after his death the action of the cosmic
void was to halt this slow death of the cells in his body
and hold him in suspended animation during the ensuing
millions of years suppose he should really die-de-
stroying his own brain what lay beyond real death
would it be a better plane of existence than the zo-
romes could offer him would he rediscover humanity
or had they long since arisen to higher planes of exist-
ence or reincarnations  did time exist beyond the
mysterious portals of death if not then it was possible
for him to join the souls of the human race had he
really been dead all this time  if so he knew what to ex-
pect in case he really destroyed his own brain oblivion

  again the intense feeling of loneliness surged over
him and held him within its melancholy grasp des-
perately he decided to find the nearest cliff and jump
from it-head first humanity called no man lived to
companion him his four metal limbs carried him
swiftly to the summit of a nearby precipice why not

gamble on the hereafter x- understanding his
trend of thought did not attempt to restrain him in-
stead the machine man of zor waited patiently

  as professor jameson stood there meditating upon
the jump which would hurl him into a new plane of
existence-or into oblivion the thought transference of
sx- reached him it was laden with the wisdom
born of many planets and thousands of centuries ex-
perience

  why jump asked the machine man the dying
world holds your imagination within a morbid clutch
it is all a matter of mental condition free your mind
of this fascinating influence and come with us to visit
other worlds many of them beautiful and new you
will then feel a great difference

  will you come

  the professor considered for a moment as he re-
sisted the impulse to dive off the declivity to the enticing
rocks far below an inspiration seized him backing
away from the edge of the cliff he joined x-
once more

  i shall come he stated

  he would become an immortal after all and join the
zoromes in their never-ending adventures from world to
world they hastened to the space ship to escape the
depressing dreary influence of the dying world which
had nearly driven professor jameson to take the fatal
leap to oblivion

   continued from page 

so was he my guest here and his kinsmen with him
together we roved the face of this second planet-the
land beyond the black desert the mountainous land
to the south and those smaller isles to the north where
thule will once more become an empire for we of
thula gave him aeros and the men of that deep buried
world will come again to the surface of their planet
leaving the underworld to those singing ones who are
already changing the swamplands and jagged ridges
to a thing of beauty where the soft blue light glows in-
stead of the wan white of the luminous clouds

  one last thing there is of mighty importance to us
of atlantis yzdral i found ipoted stripped of its great
library and tools of science but in their place was a
scroll in the old tongue of the first atlantides-a tale
stranger than any dream for it told of men of the
first planet of a mighty race advanced in wisdom
and science beyond ourselves in many ways a race which
has found the secret of the thunder of zeus even as did
that long dead prince of quetzal men who came here
to the second planet poseidon by its awful power i
know now the truth of that aero above the fused for-
tress and of the storm that drowned the living jungles

of the underworld and stripped much of the inner
caverns of the grey death-dust in the pit below luda
we found two of the thunderbolt devices which they
name by the strange word of resonator placed there
to block the path of the black ones with these as
models and with the writings of the old one who came
from the first planet for guide we have built more
some of our men of science and many of the younger
men who seek adventure wish to go there but i am
emperor now and by my word only a chosen few may
go to pave the way in a strange alien world or to bar it
to others for their life and their ideals will not be like
ours and unless there is some spot where we may start
anew undisturbed it is best to remain here in our own
world the gate between our worlds must not be closed
to those men of wisdom who seek the purpose but for
many only harm would result it is always so

  we have found the pit in the red clay where they ap-
peared marking a spot in their world where we will be
received with sympathy and counseled well and it is my
hope that we and they will share our burdens and tri-
umphs under the unity of the race but they are young
yet perhaps it may not be time must tell

the metal

by otis adelbert kline

tthen the most powerful artillery deadly bacteria and explosives known
vr and the most destructive methods available fail to be effective against
some enemys unknown weapon of war it is time very frequently to turn to
some simple means of combat and attack paradoxically though it is the simple
thing that is so difficult to hit upon in fact like some of the greatest discoveries
and inventions the most destructive chemical solutions are often discovered by
sheer accident for instance who could ever have thought purposefully of the
chemical that was finally adopted by the hero of this story

foreword

much has been written about the terrific
cataclysm of -the eruption of the
volcano coseguina with its accompani-
ment of earthquakes fires floods and
storms which carried death and destruc-
tion into salvador honduras and nicaragua

  the world has been told by a thousand writers with
a thousand different viewpoints of the awful blackness
so much more intense and so far greater in extent than
la oscuridad grande-the great darkness of 
-as to relegate the former event awe-inspiring as it was
to insignificance

  eyewitnesses who were fortunate enough to escape
with their lives from the devastated cities have described
their varying sensations when with noon and midnight
alike tiles slid from the roofs walls crumbled buildings
crashed to the shaking earth like houses of cards bells
tolled futilely in cracked towers and the air was filled
with shrieks prayers and choking dust

  but immense and devastating as it was it is not of
this cataclysm that i would write but of that infinitely
more terrible menace to all mankind which closely fol-
lowed it-which was in fact loosed on the inhabitants of
the earths crust as a direct result of the eruption for
i was an eyewitness of the first appearance of the metal
menace as well as a direct participant in the action that
followed as men struggled to shake off the fetters with
which the slimy intelligences of the nether world were
slowly and surely shackling and enslaving them

  it is difficult to attempt to write in an orderly fashion
of those nerve-racking reason-destroying events when
they are yet so close to me but life is fleeting death may
come to me at any moment and there are many facts
which are known to me alone and which should be pre-
served for posterity for this reason i begin my task as

chronicler now instead of waiting for time to bring order
and clarity to the vision	walter stuart

chapter i
the metal beings

over i shouted through the control room
phone and my pilot art reeves skillfully
banked returning the blettendorf electroplane
almost to tho exact spot and holding it there suspended
with helicopters whirring

  we were directly above the crater of coseguina but
six months had passed since its eruption the most spec-
tacular and destructive in the history of the world yet
it had not only ceased to smoke but the hot lava which
had bubbled and seethed for some months in this im-
mense cauldron of mother nature had suddenly receded
and there remained a yawning black shaft the bottom
of which was sunk so far into the bowels of the earth as
to be invisible

  it was to investigate this singular and previously un-
heard of phenomenon that my chief the secretary of the
american geographic association had sent me from
chicago in the blettendorf together with pat higgins
my photographer and assistant and pilot reeves

  descend i said and we began swiftly and smoothly
to drop toward the yawning blackness beneath us

  pat flashed on his keel and side lights and started his
automatic cameras clicking four of them like the lights
were trained on the crater walls and the fifth wras pointed
straight down through the floor

  the top of the crater was fully a mile in diameter but
as we descended the walls gradually drew closer together
presently when our magnetic altimeter showed that we
were nearly five thousand feet below sea level the shaft
assumed a uniform diameter of about two hundred feet

faith said pat with a grin this must be where
the bottom dropped out of the kettle if this keeps up
well be having tea with the devil in a couple of hours
i mopped the perspiration from my brow the air in

a huge green beetle as large
as a shetland pony charged us
with its huge four-foot man-
dibles distended   

the cabin had grown uncomfortably warm a glance
at the thermometer showed a temperature of  degrees

fm afraid we wont be able to get much closer to
his plutonic majesty without asbestos suits i replied
besides the heat will thin our oil until its lubricating
value will be nil if we burn out a couple of helicopter
bearings were due for a long hard drop

  sure wed be old and gray by the time we hit the
bottom said pat




amazing stories

    watching the thermometer and magnetic altimeter
 i saw that the heat was increasing at the rate of about
 one degree to every hundred feet of descent when it
 reached  degrees i ordered reeves to hover

    weve come as far as we dare in this machine i
  told pat ill take a look through the binoculars before
  we ascend

    i pointed my x zeiss glasses downward in an effort
  to see the bottom of the shaft but adjust them as i
  would i could see only a tiny black speck where the
  seemingly converging walls-due to perspective-of the
  pit ended i did notice something else however which
  caused me to utter an involuntary exclamation of sur-
  prise the walls of the pit beneath us were of gleaming
  silvery looking metal and winding up around them was
  a railed metal stairway on this stairway there was a
  movement-a constant flow of shiny metal globes rolling
  upward

    rapidly shifting the focus for a nearer view i looked
  for the top of the metal wall i found it in a moment and
  the powerful glasses brought every detail so close that
  it seemed as if i could almost reach out and touch
  the gleaming railing of the spiral stairway never so
  long as i live will i forget the strange almost unbe-
  lievable sight that greeted my eyes

    standing along the railing near the end of the stairway
  were four grotesque creatures somewhat man-like in
  form their bodies were glistening metal globes like
  osage oranges from which in lieu of arms and legs
  there projected four tentacles apparently constructed
  of many little globes strung together like beads perched
  on similar but shorter tentacles above the body spheres
  were smaller globes evidently the heads of the creatures
  they had enormous goggling eyes literally like head-
  lights both in shape and from the fact that they cast
  their own rays before them

    the first three of these strange beings carried long
  pipes slightly curved at the upper ends the lower ends
  were attached to flexible tubes greatly resembling con-
  duit which trailed down the stairway the fourth held
  a straight cylinder about three inches in diameter and
  four feet in length

    the first three individuals were exceedingly busy in
  fact they seemed to be the sole structural workers on
  the stupendous metal shaft that was swiftly rising from
  the bowels of the earth the metal globes which were
  rolling up the stairway were of three sizes and appeared
  to be living creatures for when they reached the ends
   of their respective lines all sprouted the queer tentacle-
  like arms and legs of the four larger creatures and pro-
  jected globular heads from their round interiors then
  those of the largest size sprang up one by one to the
  top of the unfinished wall where they retracted their
  heads and limbs and rolled closely together

  as soon as each new globe was in position the fore-
  most of the three large workers cemented it in place
  with a stream of gleaming liquid resembling quicksilver
  that poured from the tube he carried and filled in the
  interstices until a glistening pebble-grained wall resulted

    the rolling globes of the middle size leaped from the
  end of their line to make the stairway in the same man-
  ner cemented in place by the second tube-bearer while
  those of the smallest size formed the railing and its sup-
  porting bars and were fused into place by the third large
  worker

  i was dumbfounded the idea of a race of metal beings
building a structure with their own bodies cheerfully
and willingly was almost unthinkable for me it was
something quite beyond my point of view but then a
coral polyps viewpoint as it fuses its body in with mil-
lions of others to form an atoll of a reef is also iar
from the understanding of individualistic men

  havent seen a banshee have you chief  asked pat
who had noticed my startled expression

  take a look for yourself i responded i want to
know if you can see what i see

  focusing his own binoculars he looked then exclaimed
holy smokes and i thought all the fairies were
in ireland its the little people sure as my names
pat higgins

  i was looking at the fourth of the larger individuals
the one that carried the tube wondering what his func-
tion was suddenly as if attracted by the intensity of my
gaze he flashed his great goggle eyes upward for an
instant he gazed at the electroplane then he pointed
his cylinder upward and there was a crash of broken
glass as a projectile struck the floor window

  as we were without weapons i shouted an order to
reeves

  ascend full speed

  sure that one must have been a guard said pat
shutting off his clicking cameras wonder what that
was he fired at us

  the floor lurched as our craft shot swiftly upward
something rolled against my foot it was a shiny metal
globe about two inches in diameter-evidently the mis-
sile which had been fired from the cylinder

  here it is pat i said and picked it up

  but scarcely had i done so when it shot out segmented
tentacle-like arms and legs and a head that was a tiny
goggle-eyed miniature of the creature which had fired it
one of the metal tentacles whipped down on the back
of my hand with a stinging blow so startling me that i
dropped the thing it instantly scurried for the broken
floor window but pat with a no you dont scooped
it up in his empty binocular case and fastened down the
lid

  my grandfather once caught a fairy said pat and
devil a bit of good luck did he have after that it brought
him to an early grave in his ninety-seventh year

  we emerged into the light of day and pat shut off
his lights

  back to leon i ordered and reeves started
the three propellers roaring as he pointed the nose of our
craft up over the crater rim

  for our powerful electroplane capable of a speed of
five hundred miles an hour the sixty-mile trip back to
leon would only have been a matter of a few minutes
but we were not destined to complete it for scarcely had
we passed over the ruins of viejo a little more than half
the distance ere pat who had been looking backward
toward coseguina called my attention to the fact that
an immense metal globe had shot up out of the crater and
was following us through the air at a pace so much
swifter than our own that we seemed by comparison to
be standing still

  i focused my glasses on the big globe as it hurtled
swiftly toward us it was about a hundred and fifty feet
in diameter and constructed of the same gleaming metal
that we had noted in the shaft a minute and it loomed
immense and menacing almost upon us
the metal monster



  drop i ordered reeves

  he shut off the forward propellers set the wings at
perpendicular and reversed the helicopters we dropped
just in time the immense globe hurtling over us with
terrific speed its momentum must have carried it at
least five miles ahead of us before it could turn to come
back in the meantime we had descended to within a
thousand feet of the earth

  hover i shouted to reeves but scarcely had he
checked our downward progress less than five hundred
feet from the ground when the globe returned plunging
straight at us

  reeves managed to swerve slightly to one side before
it struck but our left wing was torn off and we spun
crazily beneath the supporting helicopters then a blade
broke and we went into a swift nose dive

  i caught a fleeting glimpse of the ash-covered ruins
of a great hacienda rushing up to meet us then there
was a terrific crash-and darkness

chapter ii
captured

a n immense cloud of volcanic dust arose as we
jk crashed through the tileless frame of the hacienda
jl jl roof our second helicopter had retarded our fall
sufficiently to prevent fatalities but we were badly shaken
up

  the dust was so thick that i could scarcely see my
hand before my eyes the helicopter had ceased to whirl
as we struck the motor was dead

  all right pat i asked

  safe and sound chief he replied

  and you reeves

  not hurt a bit

  good wed better get out of here at once and try to
find a place to hide that globe will be right back after
us fm afraid

  scarcely had i spoken ere something ground against
the roof and there was a metallic clank as if a chain
had been tossed to the floor

  follow me i called softly and leaping out of the
side door groped my way through the dust cloud which
was beginning to settle a little the floor was covered
to depth of more than a foot with fluffy volcanic ash
making the going difficult

  presently my outstretched hands encountered a wall
and i followed this to a doorway stumbling through i
entered a large room that was in semi-darkness i felt
a hand on my arm then pat whispered 

  theyre after us hear em clanking around in the
next room

  wheres reeves i asked

  dont know must have found a place to hide

  we came to another doorway the door was half
ajar andwe squeezed through we found ourselves in
a small clothes closet

  i peered through the interstice between door and
frame the dust was settling rapidly and the room into
which we had crashed was partly visible through the first
doorway we had entered a number of metal creatures
like those we had seen in the shaft were swarming over
the wreck their globular bodies gleamed in the sunlight
which filtered through the dust into the hole we had
smashed in the roof and hanging down through that

hole was a thick metal cable or tentacle composed of
globular segments which tapered slightly toward the tip

  the creatures investigating the  wreck of the electro-
plane were about four feet in height-the same stature as
the structural workers we had observed in the shaft
suddenly i heard the voice of reeves

  let go of me damn you

  in a cloud of swirling dust he was dragged by two of
the creatures each of which had hold of an arm out
into the sunlight his head and clothing were thickly
covered with volcanic ash evidently he had missed the
doorway had dug in and had just been discovered

  twisting kicking and cursing he was dragged up
toward the huge tentacle it whipped around his waist
then jerked him aloft out of our sight in a moment
it dropped once more with remarkable agility the
metal beings swarmed up then it was withdrawn
there was a clank like that of huge metal door being
closed and the roof creaked as if a great weight had
been lifted from it

theyve gone said pat and theyve got reeves
poor devil and we couldnt do a thing come on
i led the way to the room into which the ship had
crashed quickly mounting to its top i climbed up on
the unbroken helicopter blade and leaped to the roof
the huge metal sphere had disappeared

  pat came up beside me

  its a long walk to leon he said and my wrist
radiophone is smashed hows yours

  i tested it it was tuned for just such an emergency
with that of my secretary miss davis who was back in
the hotel soledade at leon

  it worked her answer came back clear and dis-
tinct

  yes mr stuart

  higgins and i cracked up on the roof of a large
hacienda about ten miles northwest of leon send a
helicopter taxi for us at once

  yes mr stuart right away

  i broke the connection then turned to pat

  think we can save any of those pictures i asked
why not chief  the fuselage wasnt wrecked ill
go down and get them

  the helicopter taxi arrived just as pat came up with
the cameras we got aboard

  soledade hotel i told the driver

  in five minutes he lowered us to the flat hotel roof
i paid him while pat unloaded the cameras we passed
them to a couple of liveried attendants who led the way
to our suite

  miss davis arose from her typewriter desk concern
in her eyes as we entered

was anyone injured why wheres mr reeves

hes not-

  not dead so far as we know i replied captured
ill explain later get me the secretary of the association
at once on the radiovisiphone then the president of
nicaragua

  but president monteiro and his daughter are here in
the hotel said miss davis they came from managua
today relief work you know

  all right get secretary black then ill look up
president monteiro

  the face of my chief presently appeared in the radio-
visiphone disc

stuart he exclaimed what are you up to now


amazing stories

  turn oa your recorder i replied then  tell
you

  its on go ahead

did i related every detail of the strange sights we
had just witnessed and the incredible experience
through which we had just passed

  when i finished he said

  if anyone but you had told me this stuart id think
it some sort of a practical joke but you are such a
serious person i believe you yet its possible that you
were suffering from an hallucination

  til send you photographs within ten hours i said
cameras dont have hallucinations

  right ill notify the war department remain
within call off

  as he spoke the word off the connection was auto-
matically broken his face faded from the disc

  miss davis had gotten the president of nicaragua on
the room visiphone

  president monteiro will see you in ten minutes she
said he is in parlor l

  i went into the next room where pat was busy de-
veloping his films he had taken his small metal cap-
tive from his binocular case and confined it in a stout
bird cage with a small padlock on the door it was lean-
ing against the bars watching him with its round head-
light eyes as i entered

  get your stuff in shape so you can leave it pat i
said were going to call on president monteiro in
ten minutes and take the prisoner with us

  ten minutes later i knocked on the door of president
monteiros suite pat stood behind me with his caged
prisoner we were ushered in by an attendant the
president a small dark man with a carefully trimmed
iron gray beard was seated behind a large mahogany
table beside him with her hand on his shoulder stood
a slender brown-eyed girl apparently about twenty years
of age i recognized her instantly from the photographs
i had seen of her as dolores monteiro daughter of the
president and the most famous beauty in the two amer-
icas

  the president greeted me cordially i introduced my
assistant and he presented us to his daughter an at-
tendant placed chairs

  selecting a long thin cigar from a humidor and push-
ing it toward me with a gesture of invitation the presi-
dent said

  and now senor stuart what is this important mes-
sage you have for me

  briefly i told him of our strange experience-the
astounding sights we had witnessed and our narrow
escape he smoked with countenance unruffled until the
end then he said

  understand me senor i am not doubting your word
but a story so strange as yours needs substantiation
you will not mind if i-ah-investigate further

  that is precisely what i hope you will do i re-
plied we have brought an exhibit however which i
believe will convince you-a miniature specimen of the
strange race of metal creatures we saw

  i lifted the cage and put it on the table the little
creature inside it focused its huge headlight eyes in-
quiringly  each of us in turn as if wondering what to
expect next

  looks like a man-made automaton commented the
president

  true i replied yet it and its larger fellows which
we encountered acted as if endowed with intelligence
you think these creatures will be-hostile
judging by their past actions yes

  hum well try them a little further

  he pressed a button on the table a buzzer sounded
in the next room and a uniformed aide came in

  dispatch three combat ships fully armed and manned
to the crater coseguina at once he ordered tell
them to be on the lookout for flying globes and strange
metal beings but to make no hostile move unless at-
tacked have one descend as far as possible into the
crater while the other two stand by to guard it if at-
tacked they are to defend themselves to the best of their
ability and let me hear their reports

  the aide bowed and withdrew

  perhaps you would like to see some photographs i
suggested

  with pleasure replied the president

  ill make some quick prints and bring them trp
said pat rising shall i leave the prisoner here
yes leave him said monteiro i want to examine
him further

  pat went out and closed the door the president poked
an inquiring finger through the bars at the little creature
in the cage then withdrew it hastily with an exclama-
tion of surprise as it struck at the encroaching digit with
one of its tentacle arms

  per dioshe exclaimed this one at least is
hostile we shall soon find out about the others

  we did not have long to wait the radiovisiphone
hummed and the face of the squadron commanders op-
erator appeared in the disc

  we are hovering over the southern rim of coseguina
rn- hangs over the northern rim rn- is above
the shaft it descends a huge sphere has come out to
meet it they collide the  falls a mass of wreck-
age our machine gunners are spraying the globe with
bullets as are those of the  it darts for the 
which tries to elude it but is brought down with one side
torn off it is coming at us our commander has ordered
a retreat it is too swift for us it is almost upon us

we are d-

  there was a terrific crash and the disc went blank
tensely we waited in front of the disc-the president
the girl and i it continued blank monteiro rushed into
the next room i could hear him volleying orders

  suddenly i was awai that my wrist was tingling
someone was tryxogtg call me i cressed the connection
of my wrist radiophone

staart it was the voice of reeves

 art	i	ntf where are you

 t much time called to warn you that little
metal man rno then to you keep him in darkness

leave at once theyre coming for me must-

  quick i said we must get out of here
stripping the scarf from the table i was about to
muffle the cage when something struck the window-screen
-ripped it away a huge tentacle whipped into the
room clinging to it were four of the globular metal
creatures one picked up the cage a second seized the
girl and the other two pounced upon me gripping my
arms with their powerful tentacles as helpless as if i
had been held in a steel vise i saw girl and cage jerked
the metal monster



out of the window and upward then the big tentacle
returned wrapped around my waist and dragged me
after them

chapter iii
the city of metal

i was thrown into a small brilliantly lighted room
a heavy metal door clanged shut behind me to all
appearances the floor walls and ceiling were con-
structed of seamless brown metal without windows or
doors even the source of the light was invisible it
seemed to radiate from the six metal surfaces that sur-
rounded me

on the floor lay the girl a look of terror in her eyes

  bending over i lifted her to a sitting posture the
floor lurched suddenly and i sprawled beside her re-
covering my balance i asked

  are you hurt senorita

no seiior but i am very frightened where are we

  if pm not mistaken i replied were riding in one
of the swift flying globes of the metal people

  in a few minutes there was a second lurch followed by
a sudden jolt that threw us both flat then a door opened
in the apparently solid wall and four of the metal
creatures came in helping us to our feet they hustled
us out upon a platform constructed from brown metal
it was part of an extensive system of docks along which
hundreds of the globes rested countless others were ar-
riving and leaving from and for all points of the com-
pass far above these flying globes i could see through
a dim haze a great self-luminous dome-the ceiling of
this tremendous underground world

  but most amazing of all was the immense city of
gleaming white metal which surrounded the docks-a city
of glistening towers walls and battlements all metal

  but conductors led us to a queer brown-metal vehicle
-flat with a hand-rail traversing the center longitudinal-
ly in lieu of wheels it traveled on four spheres which
supported it on idling bearings there were no seats
our captors after bundling us aboard indicated that we
must stand gripping the rail in the center

  the vehicle started smoothly accelerating with great
rapidity i was unable to see any controls and none of
our captors seemed to be driving or steering it emerging
from the dock we rolled out on a broad smooth street
paved with brown metal many vehicles like that we oc-
cupied wrere traversing this street some of them at ter-
rific rates of speed some had passengers some carried
materials of various kinds and some were empty

  moving in and out among the vehicles and often
traveling at even greater speeds were thousands of sil-
very metal globes of divers sizes i noticed some of
them no larger than buckshot while others were easily
ten feet in diameter i saw them from time to time
stop at the entrances of buildings put forth arms legs
and heads and enter others coming out of the build-
ings retracted their limbs and heads and rolled swiftly
away i judged them to be factories and afterward con-
firmed this belief

  we passed a building under construction and i saw
that it was being put together in the same manner as the
metal shaft i had seen rising in coseguina-the bodies
of thousands of these strange creatures being utilized as
building material

  presently we drew up before a metal wall about fifty
feet in height two massive gates which had previously
appeared as part of the wall itself swung back reveal-
ing a winding metal roadway which led to an immense
building that stood in the center of the most unusual
garden i have ever seen

  instead of grass flowers shrubs and trees it was filled
with mosses moulds fungae lichens and other thallo-
phytic growths short velvety gray moss carpeted the
lawn there were clumps of huge mushrooms and
morels of many shapes sizes and colors but the most
striking of all wtere the varieties of gigantic slime moulds

  the leocarpus fragilis with its gleaming golden spore
cases shaped like elongated eggs a mycetozoan on the
borderland between the animal and vegetable kingdoms
grew to a height of ten feet globe-shaped physariums
attained a diameter of three to four feet and the dusky
plumes of the stemonitis massed in large clumps waved
twenty feet above our heads not so pleasing to look
upon were the slimy gelatinous plasmodia of the various
species flowing sluggishly about in the areas to which
they had been confined questing the food which they
must have in order to produce the beautiful plumes
globes baskets and ovoid spore cases of mature ones

  they were all creatures of the darkness-conceived
and developed without sunlight-unable even to exist
in the direct rays of the lord of the solar system but
multiplying and growing prodigiously here in this weird
pale light of the nether world

  we came to a stop before what looked like the un-
broken wall of the building but here again a previously
invisible door opened revealing a circular doorway about
fifteen feet in diameter

  here we left our strange vehicle and walked between
our guards along a narrow corridor until we came to a
great central foyer which evidently reached to the top
of the building looking up i could see galleries encir-
cling it at each level clear to the top on the floor of
this room near its center was a ring of black discs each
about ten feet in diameter encircled by a narrow rail-
ing our captors led us out on one of these and directed
us to grip the railing whereupon it shot up into the air
with considerable speed then slanted over toward one
of the higher balconies

  peering over the railing i saw that we were being
lifted by a gigantic segmented tentacle emerging from
the floor where the disc had been after we had been
deposited on the balcony the disc swiftly returned to its
original position

many round doors opened on the balcony and we
were conducted through one of these along a cor-
ridor to a second much larger doorway on each side of
which stood two guards carrying metal tubes they
paid no attention to us as we were ushered into a mag-
nificently furnished room which contrasted oddly with
the plain brown metal corridors and foyer the foyer
was thickly and richly carpeted the walls were decorated
with murals near the bottom and bas reliefs above and
the ceiling was of luminous yellow metal which shed
a soft amber light over the whole scene

  at the far end of the room a figure reclined beneath
a green and gold canopy upon a luxuriously cushioned
dais raised about three feet above the level of the floor
as we drew near the throne the figure sat up i gazed
aghast at the thing that confronted us


amazing stories

  at first i thought it a living human skeleton but as
we drew closer i saw that its flesh and skin were trans-
parent its bones and teeth translucent and its viscera
and nervous system opaque its immense head fully
twice as large in proportion to its size as that of any
earthly man was encircled by a jewel-encrusted gold
band which supported an immense emerald at the cen-
ter of the forehead it wore no clothing but its waist
was encircled by a belt of golden links from which a
dagger with a jeweled hilt and several other instruments
or weapons i knew not which depended its feet were
enclosed in pointed golden slippers

  the horrible creature arose as our conductors brought
us to a halt and stepped forward to examine us it
poked me in the midriff with an inquisitive gelatinous
finger pulled down my chin to look into my mouth and
felt my arms and legs wherever it touched me it left
prints of slime very much like those left by a garden
slug its fingers felt cold and clammy

  having completed its examination of me the thing
returned to its dais and reclined then to my surprise
it addressed or seemed to address me in english

  i am disappointed in you walter stuart although
my other prisoner arthur reeves looked up to you as a
leader you are one of the creatures of the lower order
and your cranial capacity precludes the possibility of a
brain large enough to receive and retain the higher train-
ing are there no creatures of the higher order upon the
outer crust of the earth

  i take it i replied that you consider yourself a
creature of the higher order

  i rule the creatures of the higher order was the
reply

  these men of metal

  no small-brained one they are machines of my in-
vention i rule the people of my race-the higher
order of creatures-the snals with the aid of my
metal creatures my teks i conquered the inner world
-brought every snal nation under my rule they are
irresistible my teks when i direct them i am zet
conqueror and emperor of the inner world

  i am puzzled to know i said how you learned
english

  your brain is even more deficient than i suspected
said zet our conversation is one of thoughts not
words

  but i am speaking and you seem to speak i in-
sisted i can hear you

  you can speak and hear in a dream said zet yet
you actually do neither call this a dream if you like
or bring up if you wish those other words in your
mind-telepathy or clairaudience our subjective minds
are conversing without the employment of physical
means the conversation is instantly transferred to the
objective consciousness

  but who are you to question zet ruler of the inner
world  answer my question

  there are no snals on the outer crust of the earth
i said it is dominated by creatures called men of
which i am a specimen

  that is unfortunate said zet i had hoped to find
creatures of a higher order to conquer but the outer
crust will make a mighty empire-and i can set my snals
to rule over these inferior animals called men it may be
too that we can improve the race perhaps my nobles
will take some of your females into their seraglios thus

founding a new race our bodies are more fragile than
yours your brains are inferior to ours a fusion of
the races may prove of great benefit to both it is
worth trying

  im not so sure that our brains are inferior i re-
torted on the outer crust people born with heads as
large as yours are usually imbeciles

  and in the inner world people born with heads as
small as yours are invariably microcephalous idiots he
said apparently unruffled but it may be that i can use
you ill have you examined by my scientists i couldnt
use your assistant reeves he disobeyed my first order
and communicated with you to disobey is death
you mean you killed him

  i did not slay him in anger as you seem to think he
was turned over to my scientists for a thorough physical
examination which they were very anxious to make he
was the first man they had ever seen and they desired
to take him apart

  and they did this while he lived

  partly i understand that he died shortly after the
examination began

  vivisection poor art reeves cut open alive and
at the order of this big-headed slimy monstrosity be-
fore me furious anger fired me-quadrupled my strength
for the moment with a sudden jerk i twisted my arms
free of the metal tentacles that held them and leaped for
the dais my fingers ached to clutch the gelatinous
throat of the thing that had ordered his death

  with lightning quickness the hand of zet jerked a
small tube from his belt-pointed it at my breast i
felt a terrific shock as if a powerful electric current
were passing through my body my muscles grew rigid
-immobile i seemed rooted to the floor then the
two teks leaped forward seized my arms and dragged
me back to my original position

  zet replaced the tube in his belt

  so he said you are even more of an animal than
i suspected in one instant you permitted your emo-
tions to completely overthrow your reason i doubt if i
can use you but my scientists will find out while i
examine this other creature which appears to be a
female

  i saw the girl shudder as zet arose and walked toward
her then struggling futilely i was dragged away by the
two teks

chapter iv
the battle

my two metal captors took me down the cor-
ridor and out upon the balcony here they
placed me on a railed black metal disc similar
to that which had lifted us from the first floor and wre
were hoisted to the second balcony above then they
led me down another corridor and through a circular
door into a large room in which more than a hundred
snals were working some seated at tables others stand-
ing before high benches on which were flasks tubes
retorts immense magnifying glasses and much other
paraphernalia i did not recognize

  i was conducted to a square glassed-in room in the
center of this vast laboratory where a snal with a head
even larger than that of zet sat at a metal table this
room with its glass partitions was so situated that he
the metal monster



could look into any corner of the laboratory without
leaving his seat

  fastened to a metal band that encircled his head was
an immense lens that covered both eyes and most of his
nose so magnifying those hideous features that they
were out of proportion with the others and creating a
most grotesque effect

  the two teks forcibly seated me in a gray metal chair
across the table from the snal and departed i was sur-
prised that this slimy gelatinous individual would allow
me in his presence without the teks to guard me but
learned the reason when under his steady gaze i tried
to shift to a more comfortable position i was as firmly
attached to the metal chair which was in turn attached
to the floor as if i had been bound with steel bands yet
the invisible force that held me did not manifest itself
except when i tried to shift my position on the chair

  the snal stood up squinting at me through his huge
lens through his transparent body and his translucent
ribs i could see his heart beating his lungs inflating and
deflating and his stomach expanding and contracting as
it disposed of his last meal it was evident from his
demeanor that he thought me an exceedingly queer look-
ing creature the feeling was mutual

  you have been sent to me for examination walter
stuart he said finally i am hax chief scientist
of the snal empire

  i suppose youll take me apart to find out what makes
me go as you did poor reeves i replied

  you say poor reeves  he answered that is bad
it indicates the exercise of emotion rather than reason
no i do not intend taking you apart-not just now at
least you are to be tested mentally

  he pushed a shiny metal sphere on the table before
me suddenly it appeared to become transparent

  a good beginning said hax you have the vision
it may be that we can use you step into this scene

  suddenly as i gazed into that metal globe i felt my-
self drawn into it-felt that it had enlarged until it was
as high as the sky

  i was moving-walking on a metal stairway globes
were rolling up beside me becoming teks springing up
to the top of a wall in my hands-not hands tentacles
-i held a bent tube from which gleaming liquid metal
poured forth each time i pressed a small button on the
side my torso was spherical-a shining globe of metal

  when i had cemented the globe in place i waited for
another to climb up beside it meanwhile i glanced over
the rim of the wall it was level with the crater rim of
coseguina and between me and that rim thousands of
other workers like myself were building a metal city on
the sloping sides of the crater their animated build-
ing material was coming up the shaft in a steady stream
rolling up a spiral ramp that had been constructed at one
side on the crater rim a great metal dome was rising
-swiftly closing inward and upward toward the center
with amazing rapidity-shutting out the daylight from
above

  reflecting the sunlight from their shimmering sides
a dozen huge flying globes slowly circled overhead

  the vision suddenly faded i was back in the labora-
ry glued to the metal chair-a human being once
more

  you have followed well said hax now let me see
if you can control

  from beneath the table he produced two electrodes 

insulated wires he directed me to grasp one in each
hand then once more the globe before me became clear
-expanded

  i was in a huge warehouse at the peak of a pile of
metal globes i was a metal globe i could look out
through my own metal torso as if it had been a pane of
glass

  descend a voice came from somewhere beside me
yet i saw no one

  i rolled from my position and down the side of the
pyramid of globes when i was half way down the
voice said stop

  i halted clinging to the slanting surface by some mag-
netic force which i was able to control

  let go

  i shut off the force and rolled to the floor

  walk

  i thrust out leg and arm tentacles put forth my metal
head with its great goggling eyes and scrambled to my
feet

  back to your place

  suddenly retracting head and limbs i rolled back
to the top of the pyramid and lay still

  the vision faded once more i sat in the laboratory
before this strange scientist

  you can control he said that is good if you
can do this there are others of your race who can also
do it your mind is unusually strong considering the
smallness of your brain we can use you

  for what i asked

  for that which you have just done to control a tek
every tek large or small is controlled by a snal by
using your people to control the teks we will release
thousands of snals for other more intellectual duties to
which their greater minds are suited

  you mean i said that you intend to make slaves
of my people-slaves who will labor with their minds
rather than their bodies

  of those who can pass the test yes the others will
go to feed the plasmodia of the slime moulds which we
cultivate for food thus we can make use of all there
will be  waste we are efficient we snals

  perhaps but you havent conquered mankind and i
dont believe you will

  in order that you may entertain no false hopes said
hax ill showt you what is now transpiring watch
the globe

  i did it suddenly became transparent i was a
goggle-eyed tek seated high in the air in a metal room
situated in a great dome which covered the crater cose-
guina the work of building had been completed with
incredible swiftness i was surrounded by metal yet i
had he power of looking through it at any point by
flashing a special ray from between my eyes

a fleet of twelve battleships was approaching from
the south they flew the flag of nicaragua an-
other fleet of seven flying the flag of honduras ap-
proached from the north across the gulf of fonseca
the two fleets deployed and formed a semicircle front-
ing the isthmus on which the volcano was situated from
the land side an immense army approached behind a long
line of great rumbling tanks and two fleets of mighty
aerial battleships closed in above attended by several
hundred relatively small but exceedingly swift helicopter
electroplanes


amazing stories

  suddenly as if every gun in the attacking force were
under single control a terrific bombardment began shells
from the battleships and artillery rained on that metal
dome immense bombs were dropped by the aerial bat-
tleships and electroplanes projectiles of smaller caliber
from seventy-fives down to thirty-forties rattled against
that great hemisphere of gleaming metal but not one
shell or proj ectile so much as dented it

  this bombardment lasted for perhaps five minutes
without interruption and without any visible effect on
the great dome then suddenly a thousand doors that
had hitherto appeared to be a part of the solid metal
opened from each door emerged a flying globe like
a swarm of angry bees defending a hive they hurtled at
the attackers bullets rattled and shells burst against
them without effect

  two globes descended on a nicaraguan battleship
one above the fore deck the other near the stern long
metal tentacles slithered down gripping the front and
rear turrets and down these tentacles swarmed the
teks they plunged into the turrets-down the ladders
each tek as it emerged dragged a human prisoner one
by one these prisoners were passed up into the globes
the teks followed the tentacles were drawn up and
the battleship out of control traveled aimlessly in a
circle as the globes returned with their prisoners

  this scene was at the same time being enacted on
all the other battleships other globes seized the aerial
battleships with their powerful tentacles boarded them
took off the men and left them to drift unguided or to
crash one by one the electroplanes were caught and
denuded of men the army attempted to retreat but
this was quickly prevented by a row of globes which
formed on the ground stretching across the peninsula
the teks swarmed everywhere men were pulled out
of the tanks-dragged away from the field pieces or
caught as they attempted to flee or hide

  all the battleships were circling erratically there
were several collisions one- ship went down rammed
by another aerial battleships and electroplanes were
continually crashing to the ground or falling into the
gulf and the ocean huge tanks driverless climbed
the peak as far as the edge of the dome stood up grind-
ing at the shimmering metal and fell over backward
their motors roaring to tumble down the steep slope
they had climbed and smash to masses of twisted wreck-
age at the bottom

  in less than thirty minutes after the bombardment
began the last globe returned to the dome and so far
as i could see not a single one of the fighters who
had attacked so valiantly by land sea and air was left
to tell the tale

chapter v
slavery of the mind

the scene faded once more i was back in the
laboratory with hax his colorless glass-like
eyes leered at me through the huge lens

  you see he said how hopeless it is for mankind
to resist us we are invincible

  you have but defeated the forces of two small na-
tions i replied the earth has not yet begun to
fight her scientists will find a way to defeat you
her scientists are weak-minded children compared to

the most ignorant snals he said contemptuously they
are creatures of a lower order fit only for slaves and
you will go now to begin your slavery with the rest

  two teks suddenly appeared behind me seizing my
arms they lifted me from the chair and hurried me
away as i left the laboratory the mocking laughter of
hax followed me

  the teks took me out of the building the way i
had come one of the queer rolling vehicles was wait-
ing my hands were forced down on the central rail
which glowed as if with some radioactive force they
stuck there and try as i could i was unable to remove
them

  we passed through the gates in the wall and threaded
the city streets to a great large structure near the cocks
a number of other similar vehicles with glowing hand-
rails were waiting around the building and thn sands
of prisoners disembarking from arriving globes were
being herded into this building by the teks

  others were being driven out of another entrance i
noticed that some were forced to grasp the shin hand
rails while others were bound hand and foot w wire
and stacked on the vehicles like cord wood at hr i
saw only soldiers sailors and airmen wearing the uni-
forms of nicaragua and honduras but the s
presently began to disgorge loads of civilian--men
women and children whites mestizos indian ani - ti-
roes evidently taken in raids on the nearby territory

  the vehicles loaded with their human freight and
each presided over by a tek began to form in a ng
line when a train of about six hundred had been i onrsed
we left all traffic had evidently been stopped to let
us through for although i could see many vehides on
the other streets those through which our leader piloted
us were deserted

  the vehicle in which i was riding was a half mile or
so behind the one which led the procession aixnt half
of the vehicles were loaded with the bound prisoners and
half with those held by the luminous hand rails a load
of the poor bound wretches was just ahead of me i
could hear their piteous moans their wrists and ankles
were so tightly bound with wire that they were cut and
bleeding and those at the bottom of the tilt were
crushed by the weight of the ones above them

  our train soon passed through the city ani out upon
a great metal causeway that stretched above a weird and
unusual landscape of grotesque thallophytlc growths
these were in orderly array and tended by busy teks
among the cultivated plants i saw a number of varieties
of gigantic slime moulds they were cultivated in pits
about twelve feet in diameter set in rows with metal
runways between them some of the pits contained
great masses of naked polynuclear protoplasm-the plas-
modia which would later develop into adult slime moulds

  as we passed along through these fields i noticed that
from time to time one of the cars containing the bound
human beings was shunted off the causeway and along
one of the tracks which ran between the plasmodium
pits watching one of these as we sped past i saw
the tek lift a bound human being and hurl his helpless
victim into one of the pits at the next pit he stopped
and repeated the process the grim prophecy of hax
was already coming to pass

  the men who were fastened on the vehicle on which
i rode numbered about twenty there were five naval
officers five seamen eight indians and two negroes the
the metal monster



man just ahead of me wore the uniform of a lieutenant

  what did they do to you in the round building senor
lieutenant  i asked him in spanish

  we were given a test to see if we could control those
metal creatures senor he replied those who could
not pass the test-many of them women and children-
were bound with wire it is horrible what are they
doing with them

  i told him he ground his teeth and cursed luridly
presently he asked

  and what will they do with the rest of us

  as long as we can serve i replied well probably
be slaves after that food for the plasmodia

  of the six hundred vehicles that left the city about
three hundred drew up before a great dome-like build-
ing the others with their wire-bound victims had
been shunted away to the slime mould farms

  a great circular door opened in the apparently solid
wall of the building the tek who presided over our
vehicle shut off the current in the rail releasing our hands
then we were herded into the building with the others-
whites mestizos indians and negroes men and women
mixed indiscriminately

  the first room in which we found ourselves was an
immense lobby which encircled the building this room
proved to be the living and sleeping quarters of the snal
workers whose places we human slaves were to take
while one-half of the workers labored in the inner rooms
the other half slept and took recreation in this apart-
ment their bunks were metal cylinders about three feet
in diameter and seven feet long stacked three rows high
along the outer wall they contained no padding or cov-
ers and were as private as gold-fish bowls the tired
workers without bothering to disrobe crawled into them
and stretched out on the cold metal when ordered to do
so by their overseers they crawled out again to re-
ceive their meagre rations and to resume work when
their sleep period had elapsed

  the overseers wore round pointed helmets and com-
plete  suits of scale-armor made from a dull-surfaced
dark brown metal their weapons were paralyzing ray
tubes like that which zet had used on me and queer
double-edge weapons the blades of which looked like two
meat-axes welded together back to back with handles
about eighteen inches in length hooked at the end to
hang from their belts they carried slender metal rods
about eight feet in length the pointed ends of which con-
tinually glowed at a red heat

we were forced to disrobe and don the coarse
aprons in each apron were two pockets one of
which contained a glass flask and the other a shallow
bowl as fast as we donned our slave raiment we were
driven in single file past a counter where we were issued
water in our flasks and a thick jet black porridge which
i afterward learned was made from the spores of a
species of slime mould in our bowls it had a rank
musty flavor and i could not stomach it at first but as it
was the only food given us we had to eat it or starve
most of us eventually got so we could consume the
portions served us although i doubt if anyone really
learned to like the stuff

  after we had been given our garments and rations
we were herded into the immense central control room
the floor of this room rose in circular concentric ter-
races conforming to the contour of the domed roof

 above and ending in a small round platform occupied
 by the chief overseer who could thus look down 
 the entire workroom

    set against the faces of the terraces were curved tables
 twenty workers were seated at each table gazing into
 their control globes and gripping their electrodes each
 table was presided over by an armed and armored over-
 seer who gazed into a large globe mounted on a tripod
 in which he could watch the collective activities of the
 teks controlled by his workers a worker caught
 shirking or making an error was punished by a searing
 touch from the red-hot point of the overseers long rod

   i was assigned to a seat between two snal workers
 and noticed that this arrangement was maintained with
 the other slaves-first a snal then a human slave
 the young lieutenant who had ridden on the same
 vehicle with me was seated just beyond the snal at my
 right

   at a sharp command from the overseer i grasped my
 controls and gazed into my globe i instantly found
 myself a tek operating a gigantic mechanical shovel
  that was scooping up what looked like white sand from
 the floor and walls of a huge pit and dropping it into
 vehicles writh globe-wheels and hopper-shaped bodies
 these vehicles each operated by one tek moved past in
 a steady stream as fast as i filled them with the white
 sand one immense shovelful sufficed to fill each vehicle

   other teks labored nearby with similar mechanical
 shovels the vehicles i noticed were all moving toward
 a great structure some distance away from which col-
 umns of smoke or vapor were rising and from which
 at times lurid flashes of light gave a blood-orange tint
 to the surrounding landscape and to the vapors that
 floated beneath the great vault high overhead

   it dawned on me that this white sand must be a
 metallic ore-a salt of some metal-and that the building
 to which it was being taken was a smelter or refinery

    as i sat there working it seemed that i developed the
 faculty of being two places at once-thinking two sets of
 thoughts at the same time objectively i sat and worked
 in the control room subjectively i operated the me-
 chanical shovel it was like playing a piano and singing
 at the same time-or perhaps more like singing an air
 and playing a violin obbligato doing two things at once
 one objectively the other subjectively yet conscious of
 doing both

   the snals had permitted me to retain my wrist
 chronometer though my radiophone was taken from me
 they had learned its use when art reeves had sacrificed
 his life to warn me-all to no avail

   the chronometer showed that our day was divided
 into two periods of about ten hours each-a work period
 and a rest period the work period lasted for ten solid
 hours without intermission nor were we permitted to
 take our hands from the electrodes even for an instant
 during that period when the work period was finished
 the second shift of workers was ready to take our places
 we were then issued wtater and black porridge and per-
 mitted to roam about in our living quarters for about an
 hour at the end of the hour however we were per-
 emptorily ordered into our sleeping cylinders for eight
 hours we were then ordered out fed and watered and
 at the end of another hour marched into the control
 room to relieve the shift that had been working while we
 slept and rested

    the division in which i worked labored unremittingly


amazing stories

at digging and loading a seemingly endless desert of
white ore i learned from workers in other divisions that
some of them were engaged in smelting the ore some in
building metal cities and warehouses others in building
flying globes and still others in transporting materials
and prisoners through the streets of the subterranean
cities and along the metal causeways that connected them

  with the aid of my chronometer i kept careful track
of the outer world time

  within two weeks after my arrival every worker
snal in the building had been replaced by a human slave
the only snals remaining were the armed and armored
overseers

  i often thought of dolores monteiro as i had last seen
her shuddering before zet the slimy emperor of the
nether world and wondered what had become of her
she was a lovely creature and unspoiled despite the
adulation she had always received

  although certainly not human zet greatly resembled
a human being in form he had spoken of an experi-
ment-an attempt at crossing the races and i feared
that the beauty of this girl might have tempted him to
force her into his own seraglio the thought was revolt-
ing and the uncertainty was almost as maddening as
the definite knowledge would have been

  during the hours after and before the sleeping periods
i used to walk around the building scanning the faces
of all the white females at the end of a month i was
still looking for her but looking hopelessly

  then one day i was startled by the familiar sound
of a girls voice behind me

  senor

          chapter vi
         the treachery of lak

it was dolores monteiro who had called to me she
was wearing the coarse slave apron but even in this
rough garment she was ravishingly beautiful my
heart stood still as i looked down into her eyes for a mo-
ment scarcely realizing that the object of my long quest
stood before me

  senorita i exclaimed ive been looking for you
everywhere

  and i for you she replied when were you sent
here

  that first day i answered and you 

  shortly after you left me standing before zet she
replied but this is an immense place-almost a
city

  then zet did not harm you

  no she replied but i will never forget the feel of
his cold slimy hands on me she shuddered at the
memory it was nauseating ugh

  yes i know i said but didnt he do or say any-
thing else

  she answered me almost in a whisper

  that is the reason i had to find you he did say
something else and ordered me not to tell to disobey
him is death they say but i must confide in you

  dont say it i warned her

  but i must there is a reason he said i would be
sent away with the other slaves for the time being to
learn to work and to become accustomed to the ways
of his people but he said also that he would give posi-

tive orders that i should not be harmed for someday
soon he would honor me by sending for me

 you mean-

  she nodded despairingly

  i should kill myself at the first opportunity of
course but i wanted to find you first-to tell you the
one person i know and can trust in this horrible place so
that if you live and some day meet my father and
mother you can tell them the truth they might other-
wise think that i-that i went willingly and there is
no hope of escape so you see why i had to tell you

   while there is life there is hope  i quoted dont
give up will you meet me at this spot after the work
period 

  the call to work sounded as i spoke

  ill be here she replied and hurried away

  some moments later i sat down at my work table
my senses in a whirl my electrodes lay untouched be-
fore me until a searing pain on my bare shoulder and
the smell of my own burning flesh brought me to a reali-
zation of my surrroundings

  to work quickly snarled my overseer or there
will be a worse burn

  i snatched the electrodes and with my shoulder
smarting from the touch of the red hot rod started my
tek at its apparently endless task of shoveling white
ore

  the young naval lieutenant whose alert snapping
black eyes missed very little saw my punishment and
forgot for a moment to watch his globe during that
moment i saw his tek topple from the platform on
which it was working and fall into the pit

  with an angry roar the overseer seared the lieuten-
ants back

  dolt he thundered get that tek up at once or
ill burn you to a crisp

  what happened after that took place so quickly that
it was all over in less than a minute

  with a roar as angry as that of the overseer the pep-
pery young lieutenant dropped his electrodes stood
erect and sprang at the throat of his tormenter so
quick and unexpected was the attack that he was almost
upon the astonished overseer before the latter realized
what had happened

  snatching his paralyzing ray cylinder from his belt
the snal pointed it at the lieutenant freezing him in his
tracks then he stepped back and with a fiendish grin
at his helpless victim thrust the red hot point through
the brave lads heart withdrawing it deliberately he
shut off the paralyzing ray permitting the body to slump
to the floor

  this exhibition of cruelty so filled me with rage and
revulsion that i was tempted to hurl my globe at the
snals head and follow the throw with an attack but
the thought of dolores deterred me she would be
waiting for me-expecting me to meet and help her

  another slave was thrust into the lieutenants place
and his body was carried out by two teks

  take heed slaves from the death of your fellow
said the overseer and rebel not against authority lest
you share his fate

  dolores met me at the beginning of the rest period
and we went together for our food and water then sat
down on the stone floor to eat

  before we had finished eating a number of teks came
in bearing the sections of a huge metal screen which
the metal monster



they welded smoothly together and set up in the middle
of the floor several snals came a short time thereafter
and connected it with a complicated-appearing machine
while the slaves flocked curiously around

  when their work was finished a life size image ap-
peared on the screen it was zet ruler of the nether
world his emerald diadem sparkling above his slimy
features

  he began to speak and every voice was hushed to
me he seemed to be speaking english dolores told me
afterward that she thought he was speaking spanish
and a misskito indian i later interrogated was positive
the great glass face had spoken his native dialect

  zet told us that the screen had been installed for our
entertainment and information and that through it
he would keep us constantly posted on the progress of
his conquest of the world we would thus be made to
realize he said how hopeless it would be for us to rebel
against the fate which nature had intended for us-that
of serving the snals who were as superior to us as we
were to the beasts we had domesticated he ended by
promising that those of us who served faithfully and
well would be rewarded later when his empire was es-
tablished by easier work and positions of power among
our fellows

  zets image faded from the screen it was followed
by that of another snal-a short stocky individual
whose ornaments were richly powdered with jewels

  i am the voice he said  i speak for zet lord
of the inner and outer worlds behold the progress of
his conquests

the image faded and a large map of the americas
appeared on the screen

  the portions marked in green are under the domin-
ion of zet said the voice he moves slowly but
surely taking what he wants when he wants it

  from the northern border of mexico through central
america colombia ecuador and venezuela the map
was shaded green and all this in thirty days

  the map faded and in its place we were shown mov-
ing pictures in full color managua rebuilt capital of
nicaragua was shown first in the heart of the city
rose an immense metal dome-shiny and incongruous
like some false growth appearing on the fair body of
the earth we were shown a glimpse of an inner room
of the great dome president monteiro and his staff
were here guarded by teks and bullied by an armored
snal who seemed to be zets vice-regent of the nation
there were other flatter domes near the outskirts of the
city beneath these beds of slime mould had been
planted they were being tended by human slaves and
fed both with the bodies of men and domestic animals
just outside this ring was another in which were taller
domes like the one we were in-control buildings in
which human slaves toiled with their minds that the
teks might work the will of their snal masters

  we saw flashes of other capitals each with its great
shining dome centrally located and its encircling rings
of metal-covered slime mould beds and control buildings
bogota caracas quito mexico city san jose san
salvador and the rest all were under the yoke of the
conquerors

  teks rolled about the streets-swarmed everywhere
searching out human victims to be dragged before the
conquering snals who remained in their huge metal

buildings or in the flying globes tiny teks no larger
than pin heads spied on the people unseen conspirators
against the tyranny were thus quickly detected captured
and fed to the plasmodia

  we were shown the northern battle front where the
united states had stretched a huge army from gulf to
ocean to protect its territory it was not a battle but
a farce in which the teks were sent out at will of the
controlling snals to drag men from the trenches the
tanks or the decks and cabins of aircraft and whirl
them away in the flying globes against which the most
powerful weapons of the world were powerless new
weapons were being tried-oxy-acetylene flame-throw-
ers-that would cut through steel plates as if they had
been paper-bombs loaded both with nitric and sul-
phuric acids in the hope that these might prevail against
the obstinate metal but they had no more effect on it
than water has on glass

  some of these things we saw some were told to us
by the voice but i do not think there was a man or
woman in the building who was not convinced of the
truth of all of them and the utter hopelessness of our
situation mans knell of doom had sounded his
place in the sun was being slowly but surely wrested
from him by these slimy intelligences of the nether
world

  the south american republics had also extended a
great defensive line across their continent but it was
even less of an obstruction to the conquerors than that
of the united states

  after each work and sleep period dolores and i met
at the same spot we would eat our block porridge to-
gether then go and stand in front of the screen to learn
the latest news of the earths conquest

  in another thirty days the southern half of the united
states and more than half of south america were under
the sway of the snals the opposing armies had been
completely routed and most of their field equipment de-
stroyed our screen was tuned in with exploring globes
flying over the areas as yet unconquered and they
showed people fleeing northward in every means of con-
veyance at their disposal canada swarmed with refu-
gees air- and water-liners loaded to capacity were
leaving for europe africa and asia and the advance
of the metal menace continued steadily relentlessly

  dolores came to mean much to me-more than the
whole world i had never told her had not more than
touched her hand but she could do more with her eyes
than can most girls with arms and lips

  it was because of the hopelessness of our situation
that i did not speak to her of love or marriage i sus-
pected however that she knew of my love and dared
to hope that she returned it

  i always looked forward to my meetings with her as
the only bright spots in this career of mental drudgery
like those of the other slaves my brain was being
turned into a machine to work the will of the snals
and it might have become as dulled and listless as did
the others had it not been for her bright companionship

  during those first two months the snal overseers
began to select women from among the slaves to share
their quarters with them each overseer had a private
apartment jutting out from the outer wall of the build-
ing at its base these apartments were set at intervals
clear around the building and where their round doors
were placed no sleeping cylinders were piled some


amazing stories

went fearfully under the threat of the red hot torture
rods but many preferred to die in agony

  a number of overseers had asked for dolores-my
own a tall fellow named lak among them but the
head overseer had his orders she was to be saved for
zet until such time as the ruler should send for her
unless- every overseer knew that she had been com-
manded to keep this secret from the other slaves-that
if she disobeyed death would be the penalty and each
overseer combined in his person the powers of judge
jury and executioner

  many times i noticed lak watching us furtively when
we were together once  turned and saw him stand-
ing close behind us as we watched the news screen but
even then i did not guess his purpose

  it was when i had computed that about two months
of earth time had passed that i eagerly sought our
rendezvous after a work period but dolores was not
there i waited more than ten minutes but she did not
put in an appearance then i noticed a misskito in-
dian seated nearby licking his porridge-smudged
fingers and eyeing me significantly

  you look for white senorita he asked

  yes have you seen her

  in there was the laconic answer he pointed with
his porridge-smeared thumb to the door of laks apart-
ment

chapter vii
the subterranean jungle

i looked cautiously about me none of the snals
seemed to be watching my movements endeavor-
ing to appear unconcerned i walked slowly toward
the door of laks apartment it took less than a minute
to reach the edge of the pile of sleeping cylinders again
i glanced slowly around so far as i could see neither
snal nor slave was paying any attention to my move-
ments

  dodging into the passageway between the piles of cyl-
inders i tiptoed to the door it was closed but gave
when i tried the fastening i opened it cautiously for
a little way lak was standing with his back to me
holding dolores by her shoulders neither could see
me

  entering soundlessly i closed the door

  lak was saying

  you have earned death slave-girl but i can save
you only i heard you tell the secret of zet to the
slave-man you must make your choice now-your life
or the love of lak

  i had heard more than enough with a single bound
i stood beside them seizing the armored shoulder of
the snal i spun him half around

  his burning rod stood in a rack but his chopper and
paralyzing ray cylinder still hung from his belt with
a grunt of surprise and anger he grabbed for the lat-
ter but his visor was up and i swung for his face

  the result was astounding-and sickening my arm
was buried half way up to my elbow in his great round
head my fist had crashed through his nose and the
frontal bones of his face clear into his huge mushy
brain

with a feeling of intense disgust i withdrew my
arm and the metal-clad body clanked to the floor as

best i could i cleaned the slime from my arm with a
coverlet dragged from laks luxurious sleeping cylinder

  dolores who had bravely faced her persecutor to
the end now collapsed with her face in her hands and
began weeping softly i was about to try to comfort
her when i noticed something sputtering on the floor
at her feet puzzled i bent forward to investigate
a great tear trickled down between her fingers-fell
to the metal floor and where it struck the sputtering
commenced anew while beneath it a patch of white
crystals was forming

  the floor unlike that of the main building was made
of the white metal that had defied shells solid shot oxy-
acetylene flames and two of the strongest acids known
to man yet here it was changing to a white powder be-
neath a womans tears after each tear drop fell the
sputtering soon ceased but the white spots spread
with amazing rapidity presently several of them ran
together then collapsed revealing the wild thallophytic
growths of subterranean jungle about ten feet below
the floor the hole widened rapidly the metal flaking
away in white crystals it undermined the body of lak
and it fell into the undergrowth while dolores and i
looked on amazed

  a way out i exclaimed come on

  after dropping laks burning rod i swung down on
the edge of the still-widening orifice and let go alight-
ing in the muck among the soft growths with scarcely
a perceptible jar

  dolores bravely followed and i caught her in my
arms

  i stripped off the overseers belt which contained his
paralyzing ray cylinder and chopper when i had it
strapped around my waist i caught up the burning rod
and we hurried away through the grotesque fungoid
growths

  a few steps took us out from beneath the building
which stood on metal stilts set into the soggy soil as
we emerged under the luminous dome of this strange
underground world the light grew much stronger and
the vegetation taller

  soon we were hurrying through a forest of thick
slimy trunks some of them eight to ten feet in diame-
ter at the base and fifty to sixty feet in height-the
stems of colossal mushrooms often we found our way
blocked by these immense fungoids which had crashed
to the ground and for the remains of which lichens and
slime moulds of many varieties contended giant mosses
of endless shapes and hues formed most of the under-
growth and algae dominated the thousands of stagnant
pools from time to time the immense umbrella-shaped
caps overhead opened their gills to discharge millions of
spores that glittered in the queer phosphorescent light
as they swirled downward to settle over the weird land-
scape

  the animal as well as the vegetable kingdom was re-
presented in variety and profusion the lower orders
dominated in size as well as in numbers fat gray
slugs three feet and more in length fed on the juices of
the various plants about us snails of infinite variety
and immense size left their slimy trails everywhere
i recognized glass snails amber snails agate snails and
most striking of all great ramshorn snails as tall as
camels

insect monstrosities buzzed busily about or scamp-
ered over the moss an immense thousand-legged worm
the metal monster



fully twenty feet in length startled us as it crossed our
path a huge green beetle as large as a shetland pony
charged us with its huge four-foot mandibles distended
but backed up and hastily scampered away at a touch
from my searing rod a mosquito as large as a crane
buzzed about us for some time until i killed it with a
lucky thrust through the head

  the air was heavy with the musty odors of the fun-
goid growths the sickening charnel scent of the slimy
creatures that lived in their moist depths and the reek
of decaying organic matter

  stumbling slipping sliding sometimes sinking knee-
deep in clinging muck or splashing through water above
our waists we pressed onward our sole desire being
to put as much distance as possible between ourselves
and the slave quarters

  as we hurried along i pondered much on the miracle
that had wrought our deliverance from the apartment of
lak what could there be i wondered in this womans
tears that had destroyed a metal which had defied pro-
jectiles explosives heat and powerful acids in this
solution of this mystery lay the key to the door of
knowledge which if once opened would deliver the
world from bondage

  and why i wondered further had this mircale not
been wrought before surely many of the captured
woman and children had dropped tears in the metal
globes on the metal vehicles in which they had been
hauled and on the tentacle-like arms of their captors
then i recalled that the room in the globe that had
brought me in a prisoner was of brown metal as were
the bodies of the vehicles in which we had been carried
and the highways over which we had traveled the
arms of the teks although of white metal were of a
duller cast than the globes and heads as were the tables
globes and electrodes in the control room the floor
of the building except in the private apartments of the
overseers which jutted out over the jungle were of
stone

  but all this did not explain the enigma

  after five hours of wearisome travel we were glad to
stop and sit down on the moss for a breathing spell i
took a drink of water from my flask it was nearly half
full i shuddered at the thought of having to drink the
foul stagnant water we had encountered dolores also
drank some water and replaced her flask in her apron
pocket

  fm hungry she announced do you suppose any
of these plants are edible

  no doubt i replied and its equally probable that
some of them are so poisonous that a mouthful or two
would prove fatal the question is which are poisonous
and which are edible we have no way of knowing

  then what are we to do

  we may run across some of the varieties of slime
moulds that the snals cultivate for food i replied
their spores are good to eat and in the palace gardens
i saw some gigantic morels i think we would be safe in
using these for food if we could find any in the outer
world the morel is the one mushroom form that is never
poisonous

  in that case she said let us look for morels

  rested by our brief pause we resumed our journey
presently the character of the vegetation changed as
we came out of the marshy country to higher and drier
ground the moss was replaced by short white snake

grass and huge jointed reeds began to take the place
of the tall mushrooms

  we had not gone far when we came to a group of
large mounds uniformly about fifty feet in diameter and
twenty feet high

  fm going up and have a look around said dolores
and suited her action to her words by scampering up
the side of the mound she had not taken more than
five steps when one foot broke through into a compart-
ment underneath she withdrew it with a scream of
pain and came running toward me her knee bleeding
then a white thing about eighteen inches in height
popped out after her and pursued her on six rapidly
moving legs behind it came another and another and
i recognized them for what they were-giant termite as
large as pet bulldogs and ten times as dangerous

  i ran toward her my burning rod ready for action
but before i reached her a veritable army of the formi-
dable creatures came rushing toward us from around
both sides of the mound their great hooked mandibles
snapping menacingly

  no use to argue with those things i shouted we
wouldnt have a chinamans chance can you run

  and how she replied passing me like a bullet

  i was not slow to follow but i soon saw that we were
being outstripped by the swift six-legged creatures de-
hind us and that it would only be a matter of a few mo-
ments before we would be pulled down and torn to
pieces

  climb something i cried it will be our only
chance to hold them off

  dolores leaped for the nearest jointed stalk and
scrambled up i at her heels just as the foremost term-
ites came snapping up behind us

  i thrust the point of my burning rod into the open
mouth of the leader and sent it tumbling back on those
behind it then an astounding thing happened there
was a roar overhead as if a dozen helicopter blades had
suddenly gone into action and the stalk to which we
were clinging left the ground with amazing rapidity

  i glanced upward and saw the reason instead of a
scaly plant stalk we were clinging to the slender seg-
mented body of an immense insect and already we
were so high above the ground that to let go would mean
certain death

chapter viii
monsters of the nether world

the huge insect to which we were clinging flew
off with incredible speed its immense wings
which when quiescent i had taken for the spatu-
late leaves of a strange subterranean plant whirred so
rapidly that they were invisible the creature itself
greatly resembled a titanic dragon fly with its massive
head great bulging eyes and long relatively slender
body it flew at an elevation of about a thousand feet
and watching the ground i calculated that it was carry-
ing us at a speed of over a hundred miles an hour

  clinging to the rim of the huge segment with one
hand and gripping the round body with both legs i
watched the rapidly changing landscape beneath us
presently all signs of vegetation ceased and we were
flying over a barren gleaming white area of dunes and
hollows


amazing stories

   on the next segment in front dolores was clinging
 tightly with hands and arms and i noticed that she
 too was anxiously watching the landscape below i
 shouted to her but she could not hear me because of the
 whirring of the huge wings and i could not creep
 nearer to her without danger of losing my grip on our
 living aircraft and pitching to sudden death below

   so occupied was i in watching the landscape beneath
 that i did not notice the immense black thing flashing
 downward at us from above until it struck huge teeth
 sunk into the thorax of the giant dragon fly just back
 of the head its wings quivered then hung limply it
 was a swift clean kill we were borne swiftly aloft
 in a steep spiral and i had an opportunity to observe
 the thing that was carrying us it was an immense
 black-skinned hairless bat the body of the insect
 trailed almost vertically making it much more diffi-
 cult to hang on than when it had been flying hori-
 zontally it appeared that the giant bat had not even
 noticed us taking us for part of its victims body

   as we spiraled higher and higher the light grew
stronger above us while the outlines of the ground be-
low became more and more blurred and indistinct

   up and up we went through the drifting diaphanous
 mists until we were just under the luminous dome of
 this weird nether world fully five miles above the
 ground my eyes were dazzled by the brightness of the
 rugged luminous and probably radioactive stone that
 formed the vault

   the bat hovered for a moment beneath a huge jagged
 opening in the dome as it did so i saw that there were
 a number of similar openings nearby then it flew
 upward and to one side alighting in a self-illuminated
 cave about a hundred feet square

   i wondered why the monster had not devoured its
victim on the wing as outer world bats habitually do but
i realized the reason when two of its offspring which
had been hanging upside down from a ledge at the back
of the cave fluttered to the floor and rushed toward the
parent screeching and flapping excitedly

   the adult bat laid the insect on the floor with us
 still clinging to it then turned and dived back through
 the opening

   judging by the size of the parent the two youngsters
 that were rushing toward us were about a quarter
 grown but this did not prevent them from being ex-
 ceedingly formidable antagonists for each stood more
 than ten feet in height and was armed with long sharp
 teeth as well as wicked looking claws on wing joints and
 hind feet dolores and i both sprang to our feet and
 backed away as they pounced on the insect and began
 feeding voraciously as if each feared that it would get
 less than the other would

   my first impulse was to look for some way of escape
 while the two immense youngsters were occupied with
 their feast bidding dolores secrete herself behind one
 of the boulders that cluttered the floor i made a care-
 ful search circling behind the young bats and return-
 ing in front of them they watched me with their black
 beady eyes but evidently did not think me quite as
 tempting a morsel as the insect

   having assured myself that there was no way out of
 the cave except that by which we had come i returned
 to the boulder with the beady eyes of the bats still fol-
 lowing me as they finished the remains of the ill-fated
 dragon fly

  our situation appeared utterly hopeless there we
were five miles above the surface of the nether world
and we knew not how many uncounted miles below the
surface of the earth imprisoned with two hungry beasts
larger and more formidable than the greatest of the
outer world carnivora moreover we might expect at
any moment the arrival of one or both of the parents-
creatures four times as large as the ones we now faced

  there seemed little question but that the young bats
would attack us and that was quickly resolved for as
soon as they had finished their feast and licked their
chops for a moment they came hopping and flapping to-
ward us

  with laks paralyzing ray cylinder in my left hand
and his burning rod in my right i leaped up on the
boulder behind which dolores crouched

  as soon as they were within striking distance both
of them reached out to seize me whereupon i held the
one  my left with the paralyzing ray and lunged at
the other with the burning rod i struck for the eye
but the beast dodged and the point seared itself into the
hunched shoulder instead

  with a siren-like shriek of rage and pain the burned
creature jerked back out of reach of the point toppled
on the edge of the entrance for a moment and then
fell squawking and fluttering down the steep shaft
as it had not learned to fly it was undoubtedly dashed
to pieces on the ground five miles below at any rate
i did not see it again

  the other young bat held by the powerful paralyzing
ray stood helplessly while i plunged the point of the
burning rod into its heart then as i withdrew the
rod and shut off the ray a shudder ran through its frame
and it toppled over on its back dead

although we had vanquished our immediate ene-
mies we were a long way from being out of our
predicament

  dolores came out from behind the boulder and to-
gether we examined the fallen monster

  presently she said

  tell me the truth wallace is there no way out
no hope of escape

  im afraid not i replied

  then we are to die here together it doesnt matter
how well be slain by the mother bat when she returns
or perhaps by her mate even if you conquer both
monsters with the weapons of lak were trapped here
to die of hunger and thirst in one case it will be a
matter of a few hours the other a few days am i
not right

  it looks that way i replied kicking absently at the
tip of one of the webbed wings my head turned away to
hide my feelings

  wallace look at me

  i turned and she came up very close her glorious face
upturned to mine

  wallace isnt there something you would like to say
to me before we-are taken by death

  there was that in her eyes which sent the hot blood
coursing through my veins and made me forget the peril
in which we stood the burning rod clattered to the
floor of the cave as i crushed her to me-claimed her
sweet lips

  but wallace you have said nothing she panted

  i cant make you pretty speeches i replied nor can
the metal monster



i croon sweet love songs but i love you dolores you
know that now

  i have known it all along she confessed but i
wanted to hear you say it dios how i love you my
big american and we are to die so soon

  her arms went around my neck-clung there and she
buried her face in my shoulder weeping softly

  desperately i looked about me there must be a way
out i must think i must plan

  suddenly an idea came to me

  dont cry dear i said i think ive hit on a plan

  what is it she asked eagerly

  there is enough material in the webbed wing of that
young bat to make a parachute that will carry us both
to the ground i said and im going to try to make
one

  ill help you she replied lets work fast the
mother bat may come back at any moment

  using laks keen two-edged chopper i quickly
severed the immense wings from the body in the
webs there was material enough for our purpose and to
spare i cut a number of long strips to serve as rope
and with these dolores stitched the larger pieces to-
gether punching the holes with the tip of the burning
rod

  when i had exhausted the supply of web which we
could spare for this purpose i skinned the immense
carcass and cut the hide into strips two inches in
width i fastened the ends of these around the edge of
the parachute while dolores finished her job of fasten-
ing the larger pieces together

  this work completed i drew all of our guy straps
together and tied them to a ring-strap cut trebly wide
that it might stand the extra strain to this i added
a strong loop on each side forming a swing seat for each
of us and we stepped back to view the result of our
labor

  it appeared exceeding crude and awkward but it
would be strong enough

  are you ready to make the jump i asked

  i slipped the loop of her swing strap around her cau-
tioning her to hold on with both hands

  well drag the whole thing clear up to the edge i
said then jump out away from the ledge as far as pos-
sible otherwise the chute may catch on the edge and
swing us back against the face of the rock

  luck had favored us thus far by the prolonged ab-
sence of the mother bat and i wondered as i arranged
the folds of the chute on the rim of the abyss if it
would fail us now

  for a moment i strained dolores to me in a farewell
kiss then i caught up the burning rod and with a
one two three we leaped

  for several seconds we hurtled downward at a breath-
taking speed the walls of the shaft vanished and
we were shooting down through the mists of the nether
world sky our speed unslackened it hasnt opened
i thought were doomed but even as this thought
came to me the guy straps suddenly tightened with a
jerk one of them snapped and fell down trailing its
wet inner surface over my shoulder our speed slack-
ened a few seconds more and we were gliding smooth-
ly downward the immense web that had been designed
to support the huge body of the bat in flight easily
sustained us

a cry of exultation came to my lips but it quickly
changed to an exclamation of horror as i sud-
denly saw flapping toward us the immense black bulk
of the mother bat she was carrying a huge beetle in
her mouth but dropped it as she came closer and
scented the hide of her dead offspring with a horrible
shriek more powerful and ear-splitting than the sound
of a steam siren she dived straight at us her immense
maw gaping her lips drawn back in a hideous snarl that
revealed her big ugly teeth

  i whipped the paralyzing ray cylinder from my belt
and gripped both it and the strap at my left with my left
hand while i couched the burning rod beneath my right
arm i had my misgivings as to whether or not the rays
would have any effect on so huge a bulk but it was our
only hope

  to my surprise and relief it worked the giant bat
unable to move her wings turned over and began hurt-
ling groundward in a nose dive but she had not fallen
far before the rays ceased to affect her whereupon she
righted herself and came back at us

  again i turned the rays on her and again she
plunged downward only to right herself and come back
as fiercely as ever she repeated the process persis-
tently and to my horror i noticed that she was able to
get a little closer each time the battery was growing
weaker

  presently she came so close that i thrust the burning
rod into her mouth with a snarl she clamped her huge
teeth down on it snapping the metal shaft as if it had
been matchwood she opened her mouth once more and
shook her head attempting to dislodge the searing point
but it had already passed her throat and was burning
its way down into her vitals

  with a horrid gurgling scream she went into her last
nose dive falling like a plummet i saw her strike the
ground several seconds later but we were drifting in an
air current that had in the meantime carried us some
distance to one side i noticed for the first time that
we were above a huge expanse of glistening barren
white dunes a short time thereafter we alighted sink-
ing to our ankles in a substance which i readily recog-
nized-the white crystals which my tek had been load-
ing these many days to be hauled to the smelter it was
the material from which the snals manufactured their
miraculously hard metal

  disentangling ourselves from our straps we set out
over the rolling dunes as all directions were alike to
us we set our faces toward what looked like a rugged
mountain range some of the jagged peaks of which
pierced the clouds our water supply had dwindled to
a swallow apiece and we were ravenously hungry

  for hour after hour we plunged onward through the
weird light of the changeless day we stopped once
exhausted and slept for twelve hours by my chrono-
meter upon awakening we drained our water flasks
and pressed forward once more but so great was the
distance of these mountains which at first had only
seemed a few miles away that they appeared to recede
as we advanced toward them

  another four hours of walking however made the
outlines of the mountains bulk much nearer and where
there are mountains there are usually springs or
streams after a brief rest we set forth once more
but it was not long before dolores staggered and fell
i tried to pick her up and fell beside her my strength


amazing stories

was fast waning i tried to murmur a few words of en-
couragement to her but my lips were dry-my tongue
so swollen that they sounded like the muttering of a
drunken man it did not matter however as she had
swooned away

  after a brief breathing spell i arose and taking
dolores in my arms proceeded carefully conserving
my strength and pausing at short intervals to rest

  we were less than a mile from the nearest mountain
when dolores regained consciousness she immediately
insisted that i set her on her feet i did so and found
that after her rest she could make better progress than
i

  i was floundering along so exhausted that i staggered
as if intoxicated when suddenly she clutched my arm

  look she cried water just ahead 

  together we stumbled out of the loose sands of the
white desert to a flat formation of lava rock about half
way between us and the mountain we had made our ob-
jective a small circular pool of water gleamed in the
weird light

  the sight renewed my strength yet it seemed ages
before we reached the side of the sparkling pool

  take it easy i cautioned bathe your face first
and sip slowly

  we threw ourselves flat at the-edge of the pool i
bathed my parched face then sipped up a few drops
from the hollow of my hand but scarcely had the liquid
entered my mouth than i spat it out in dismay it was
loaded with salt glancing at dolores i saw that she
had made the same disappointing discovery

  i sat up wearily-despondently-and she crept over to
me resting her head against my shoulder

  what a dreadful disappointment she said

  suddenly i heard a familiar clanking sound behind
me glancing back i saw a flying globe which had de-
scended not fifty feet from us the clanking sound was
caused by the long segmented cable it had dropped
down this cable swarmed a score of teks then they
spread out in a wide semicircle and ran toward us
there was no mistaking their purpose and no question
but what if we were captured zet would impose the
death penalty on both it would be as wtell to die fight-
ing

  i stood up and with laks chopper in my hand
awaited the attack

            chapter ix
            the escape

as i stood in front of the briny pool defiantly shak-
ing the chopper of lak at the advancing teks
an idea came to me-an idea born of a theory
which i had been pondering since the tears of dolores
miraculously opened our way to escape from the slave
quarters

  our metal enemies were almost upon us when i bent
and with my arm about her waist helped dolores up

  come i whispered into the water

  we turned and ran splashing through the heavy
brine a few steps and it reached our waists the teks
splashed in after us the circle was closing in at both
ends suddenly their metal torsos began to sputter and
pop flaking away in a white powder wherever the brine
had spattered

  splash them i told dolores and used the flat of
the chopper to deluge those nearest me she bravely
splashed those on her side presently a tek stumbled
-sank beneath the surface above the spot the water
effervesced like champagne another sank-a third
two that had only been slightly splashed tried to make
the shore i followed them deluging them with brine
they sank down sputtering and melting away in the
shallows

  in less than five minutes the twenty teks were a semi-
circle of wreckage consisting mostly of neck arm and
leg tentacles covered with masses of fluffy white crys-
tals

  dolores and i climbed up on the bank despite our
thirst and weariness we felt refreshed by our salt-water
plunge

  if i could only fly that globe i said we might still
have a chance to get away

  why i can do that she said for the past forty
work-periods i have controlled a tek flying a freighter
which carried liquid metal from a smelter to a factory
suppose there are more teks aboard i said

  not likely she replied a crew always consists of
twenty the pilot could lock the controls and land with
the rest

  well well take a chance but with a little preliminary
preparedness i said let me have your flask

  she handed me her glass flask and i filled both hers
and mine with salt water pocketing one and carrying
the other in my hand i walked up beneath the globe
the cable did not as i expected whip around my waist
i guess you were right after all i said come on
she came up beside me but scarcely had she done so
ere the cable swiftly wrapped around both of us jerking
us up through the round door it put us down upon a
floor of brown metal in front of a tek that had one
tentacle on the control board

  so small-brained ones you thought to escape me
the voice issued from the metal mouth but i recognized
it instantly it was the voice of zet emperor of the
nether world

  we came near doing it zet i replied for small-
brained ones we didnt do so badly

  ha ha ha what foolish bunglers you are to
be sure to pit your puny intellects against mine ho
ho  ho but i must bring you before me i would
pass judgment in person

  the tentacle of the tek jerked a lever and the door
clanged shut behind us our waists were still gripped
by the huge tentacle but i could move my arms freely
suddenly uncorking the flask i held in my hand i
splashed brine on the spherical body in front of me and
on the round head some of it ran down the head-hole
into the mechanism

  globe and head began sputtering furiously-flaking
away as white powder

  fool said the metal mouth in the voice of zet
i pass judgment now

  the arm tentacle jerked a lever and the huge cable
that encircled us slowly tightened its folds squeezing
the breath out of us drawing the chopper from my
belt i struck at the tentacle that clung to the lever it
sagged but hung on again i struck exerting all my
strength and the blade severed it not being of the
hard white metal it was vulnerable

  with a corner of the blade i struck up the lever the
the metal monster



coils of the cables instantly loosed us the tek at-
tempted to swing around-to use the other arm tentacle
but it was too far gone it staggered and fell to the
floor with a shower of white powder

  dolores sprang to the control board she pressed
a lever and the globe lurched violently as it sprang
upward she moved another lever and we settled down
to a straight course

  above the controls two round lights hung on head-
straps dolores took them down handed one to me
and strapped the other around her head

  if you will put that on she said you can look out
through any part of the globe with it the invisible
rays are turned on or off simply by raising your eye-
brows

  i strapped on my light and found that it worked as
she had said

  funny they left these things hanging here i said
when the teks have them already built into their
heads

  sometimes the snals fly these globes in person she
replied they are kept here for that purpose

  i raised my eyebrows and my light clicked on the
rays which emanated from it must have been effective
only for a short distance for though they made the
globe appear transparent everything beyond it looked
perfectly natural looking downward through the
floor i saw that we were above a jungle of primordial
growths i was gazing at the queer plants and beasts
beneath us when dolores suddenly cried

  a globe pursues us we are discovered

  slow up and let it come close to us i said then
open the door

  i had corked and was holding dolores flask still half
full of brine the other globe shot swiftly up behind
us

  i lurched over to the door and grasped the rail beside
it holding the flask poised in my other hand

  all right i shouted

  the door swung open the other globe was now less
than fifty feet from us i hurled the flask and had the
satisfaction of seeing it break against the pursuing globe
scattering its contents over the gleaming surface

  the door clanged shut but i continued to watch the
pursuing globe by means of my penetrating head light
a sputtering white patch instantly appeared where the
brine had struck soon this was replaced by a gaping
hole with rapidly widening white edges from which
fluffy crystals were flaking

  dolores accelerated our speed and shot upward the
other globe attempted to follow but it was rapidly losing
power soon more than half of its surface had disap-
peared exposing its mechanism and inner room swarm-
ing with teks another moment and it hurtled ground-
ward burying itself in the soft muck of the swamp

dolores straightened our course once more
ahead of us lay the metal city to which we had
first been brought-the capital of the nether world and
about five miles to our right was a great cone of lava
nearly two miles high above this cone was the gleam-
ing mouth of a metal shaft which thousands of globes
were constantly entering and leaving

  steer for the shaft i said perhaps we can bluff
our way through to the outer world they cant tell
who is in this globe can they 

  not unless they use the penetrating rays she re-
plied and they can only do that at close range i dont
think we can make our way through however zet will
expect us to try and will be prepared

  then well try another way i said

  a moment later wre plunged into the shaft-shot
swiftly upward the speed of the globe was terrific
i had no means of computing it and because of this
i had no idea how many miles of shaft we had traversed
when we suddenly shot up beneath the huge metal dome
that covered coseguina

  dolores brought the globe almost to a stop-hover-
ing uncertainly

  now where she asked

  i recalled my two visions of this dome-the first when
it was in the process of building-the second after it
was completed

  not the ports i said theyll surely catch us
there fly close to the wall

  she instantly brought the globe to within ten feet of
the arching wall

  open the door

  as the door flew open i hurled my flask of salt water
at the wall the flask shattered spreading the brine
over an area about ten feet in diameter

  another globe apparently noting our strange actions
shot upward toward us to investigate dolores saw it
closed the door and flew away circling the huge dome
a second globe rose to cut us off then a third and a
fourth dolores managed somehow to dodge all of
them soon the dome swarmed with flying globes all of
which looked alike we were darting in and out among
the others and i doubt wrhether more than one or two
of their pilots had any idea which globe we were in
several globes collided bouncing apart like billiard balls
but undented and apparently unharmed

  twice we flew past the rapidly widening hole in the
dome where i had hurled the salt water but each time
it was too small for us to squeeze through then we
were herded away from it by the other globes for several
minutes by dint of much skillful manipulation on the
part of dolores we managed to get back to it this time
there was room to spare

  at last i cried as we shot out into the sunlight
which we had not seen for more than two months

  beautiful isnt it said dolores now where shall
we go

  get some altitude i replied then well look
around we must find a place to hide first of all

  far out on the pacific i saw a rain storm coming

  quick  i said into that storm

  a long trail of globes was after us and more were
continually emerging from the dome like a cloud of
angry wasps we plunged toward the storm in less
than two minutes we were in it at least a thousand
globes were on our trail by that time but once we got
into the thick clouds they could not see us nor we them
we veered off sharply to the right traveling at tremen-
dous speed presently our globe popped out of the
clouds into the sunlight once more

  coseguina had been left at least a hundred miles be-
hind and we were traveling toward the northwest near
the coast of salvador

  looking downward i suddenly spied beneath the
water the slender shadowy forms of a fleet of sub-
marines-about twenty in number


amazing stories

  if i only had my wrist-radiophone i said

  i managed to keep mine said dolores and reach-
ing into the coils of her dark hair she extracted it and
handed it to me i thought it might be useful in an em-
ergency she added

  it certainly will i responded working the call
plunger and constantly changing the wave lengths say-
ing each time ahoy submarine fleet

  presently i got a reply who calls the fleet
wallace stuart i responded in the flying globe
above you with senorita monteiro we just escaped
from the snals

  come closer and show yourself at the door wallace
stuart was the reply

  dolores dropped the globe to within a hundred feet
of the water she pressed the lever that opened the
door and i leaned out gripping the hand rail then the
submarine just beneath us began to rise presently its
tower emerged from the water then up came its tur-
rets rails and deck a hatch swung open and two
men came out one wore the uniform of a u s na-
val officer the other was in civilian clothes to my
surprise i recognized my former assistant pat hig-
gins

  pat i shouted down to him what the devil are
you doing on the iron fish

  secretary black ordered me to bring him the cose-
guina films in person he said when he heard you
were captured but after i got back i enlisted in the
naval air service and came down here to do some scrap-
ping i was lucky enough to dodge the globes until
yesterday then one bad cess to it cut me down my
pontoons saved me until this ship came along and took
me off so here i am its sure good to see you alive
and well again chief

  while he was talking dolores had gently lowered our
globe until it swung just a few feet above the deck
she locked the controls and came over beside me where-
upon both men instantly doffed their hats i dropped to
the deck of the submarine and gave her a hand down
pat introduced me to the officer rear admiral eldridge
in command of the fleet i introduced the officer to
dolores and we all went below a few moments later
the ship submerged leaving the globe to drift aimlessly
a few feet above the surface of the pacific

  our first request as we were ushered into the admirals
cabin was for water we drank eagerly but sparingly
then i told the admiral the amazing secret of the sup-
posedly indestructible metal

  salt he exclaimed who would have thought it
and here we have had millions of tons at our disposal
without thinking to try it

  i believe its really the chlorine that does the trick
i replied the metal i know not what to call it must
be an element unknown to our outer world chemists
in its natural state it is combined with chlorine forming
a white salt this white salt is mined with the chlorine
removed leaving the basic metal which is in the form
of an impalapable powder this powder is mixed with
a liquid preparation forming a colloidal solution that
acts much like cement the liquid evaporates quickly
leaving the solid metal the particles cohering because
they have regained the water of crystalization lost in the
refining process

  but what causes the rapid action of the salt on the
metal  asked the admiral

  the chlorine in the salt i said apparently has a
much stronger affinity for the strange metal than it has
for sodium as soon as the two come in contact in an
aqueous solution the chlorine is torn away from the
sodium to unite with the other metal forming the
white crystals which are the chloride of the metal and
in which state it is stable in nature the effervescing
is caused by the escaping hydrogen displaced by the
sodium as it unites with the water to form sodium
hydroxide it is plain that but very small quantities of
of chlorine are necessary for the conversion of large
areas of metal it may be also that the process once
started mysteriously rejuvenates itself in some way like
the mysterious disease which attacks and often destroys
old bronzes that have come in contact with saline solu-
tions

  well let the theories go for the present he replied
and broadcast the news well tell em to use salt water
but also to try chlorinated water potassium chloride
calcium chloride hydrochloric acid-anything they hap-
pen to have handy that is a chlorine compound or
solution

  have they captured chicago yet i asked

  they have every big city in the united states he
replied and many of the smaller ones but they havent
taken the radios out of the homes nor the salt excuse
me while i broadcast boy theres going to be some
revolution

  he went out to the radio room and a steward brought
in two large juicy steaks to which dolores and i did
full justice during his absence

  when he returned i submitted a plan which had oc-
curred to me for attacking coseguina if it worked as
i hoped it would the communication between the upper
and lower worlds would be severed forever

  all the rest of that day we were preparing for the at-
tack-loading shells with wet salt and preparing special
salt water bombs for the six small diving electroplanes
which clung to the deck of each submarine and while
we made our preparations we cruised slowly toward our
objective

            chapter x
            the revolt

it was dark and a steady rain was falling when we
hove to about a mile from coseguina point the
huge metal dome above the crater gleamed brightly
with each recurring flash of lightning the rest of the
time it showed merely as an immense dark bulk except
at rare intervals when its lighted ports opened to admit
or let out flying globes speeding on the errands of the
slimy lord of the nether world

  the upper works of twenty-four submarines silently
emerged from the surface of the water and like a
frightened covey of quail there suddenly rose from the
decks a hundred and forty-four diving electroplanes
their props and helicopters whirring

  there was an interval of four minutes during which
every submarine swung broadside thus presenting simul-
taneously its front and rear turret guns toward the
enemy

  when the four minutes were up the bombardment
commenced at first only the flashing of the guns and
the bursting of the shells and bombs were visible but
the metal monster



soon great holes through which the light escaped be-
gan to appear in the dome

  out of the dome swarmed the globes by thousands
but after a few volleys the fleet again began to sub-
merge by the time the globes arrived all were safely
beneath the surface the electroplanes also were well
concealed flying about in the rain clouds high above
the fast-dissolving dome

  the fleet now lined up with every prow pointed to-
ward a narrow inlet that cut into the shore line some-
thing shot from the prow of the flagship and traveling
just beneath the surface streaked straight for the inlet
it had not gone more than a quarter of a mile before a
second torpedo from the boat next to it shot out with
the same objective the other boats discharged their
torpedoes each in turn keeping them about a quarter
of a mile apart

  just as the fifth torpedo was launched the first one
struck the shore there was a terrific explosion the
shock of wrhich came back through the water jarring our
ship tremendously but when the debris had settled the
inlet was deeper by a full eighth of a mile the second
torpedo following the path of the other unswervingly
despite the agitation of the water blasted away another
eighth of a mile of earth leaving a great hole into which
the water rushed and following these in rapid suc-
cession came the others swiftly cutting a huge canal
an eighth of a mile in width from the pacific straight
through the lava-clad shoulder of the volcano

  the great dome meanwhile was swiftly melting away
-crumbling to white powder which was washed down
by the rain and whirling erratically about it like may-
flies around a street light were the mighty fighting globes
of zet--impotent utterly helpless against this attack by
enemies they could not see or reach

  it took forty-five torpedos to blast the canal all the
way to the shaft but long before this was accomplished
most of the huge metal dome had melted away

  with a swift rush of swirling waters the mighty
pacific surged into the crater-formed a whirlpool just
above the mouth of the shaft

  the diving electroplanes no longer concerned about
the dome began attacking the globes using hollow bul-
lets filled with salt water in their machine guns the
submarines stuck the muzzles of their anti-aircraft guns
up out of the water and ateach explosion of a well-
aimed shell one or more of the globes was spattered
with thick brine

  flying globes their shells eaten away as if by immense
white cankers fell into the water around us by hundreds
a few of them dived into the water-filled shaft several
others hurtled away to escape in the darkness but most
of them were destroyed

  the battle over dolores pat and i flew to managua
in one of the diving electroplanes we found that the
people had received our radio message and had acted
promptly the ring of flat domes that had encircled the
city was a circle of white ruins and the immense dome
that had arisen in the center of the town was a mass of
brown metal wreckage covered with white powder and
strewed with the arm neck and leg tentacles of defunct
teks

  much of this had been accomplished by wet salt fired
from shotguns rifles and pistols and much by hurled
bottles filled with brine

we found president monteiro established in tem-
porary quarters until such time as a new capitol
building could be constructed he wept as he embraced
dolores and wrung the hands of pat and me

  messages were coming in over the radiovisiphone
everywhere the teks globes domes and equipment were
being destroyed by the simple means we had discovered
and the snal overlords were being killed or captured
in new york fireboats had sprayed brine on the great
dome that dominated manhattan from its place on the
battery everywhere globes and teks had been
destroyed with brine-filled shells and hollow projectiles
filled with wet salt

  in chicago the fire department had melted away the
huge dome that squatted in the center of the loop by
using chlorinated water the metal shackles were drop-
ping from the world millions of human slaves were
being set free to return to homes and families

  while we were seated in president monteiros office
listening to the radiovisiphone announcements a tall
huge-headed snal prisoner was brought in he had been
riding in a flying globe shot down by a band of misskito
indians to my surprise i recognized hax chief scien-
tist of the snals who had been on a tour of inspection

  so he said eyeing me coolly as i stared at him in
surprise you discovered the secret of the metal you
have done well for a small-brained creature

  the tears of a woman revealed it to me i replied
i dont profess to understand the thing now

  the power of zet is destroyed he said nor do i
greatly care i was opposed to this conquest from the
beginning now i am cut off from my world forever i
am willing to trade my scientific knowledge for a chance
to live and continue my experiments

  i believe the associated governments of the earth
will grant you that said president monteiro

  i can make you flying globes said hax that will
utilize the terrific power of the earths magnetic lines of
force i can show you how to construct metal servants
-teks-that will respond to your thought waves as
readily as your own bodies i can make you--

  i doubt said the president dryly whether the world
will want any of these well see

  one thing i cant understand i said is why the
crater of coseguina cooled so rapidly

  ill explain that said hax blinking at me through
his huge lens we had always suspected the existence
of the outer wrorld but never were we able to reach
it our borings invariably entered strata of molten rock
too hot to work we had experienced many earthquakes
and volcanic eruptions but ours were always above
rather than below us the vents always sealed them-
selves eventually by the slow cooling of the lava but
after the terrific eruption of coseguina which had poured
out millions of tons of hot lava on the surface of our
world forming an immense cone that reached almost to
the vault our investigating scientists noticed that the vent
did not seal itself after the lava flow ceased and that
our atmospheric pressure had increased as if another at-
mosphere had been superimposed on it

  the vent was at first too hot for the snals to in-
vestigate but we sent our proxies the teks in flying
globes having ascertained that it led to an outer world
we cooled it swiftly with a spray of liquid helium-then
lined it with a metal shaft impervious to further incur-

  f ind-readn g may some time be proved not entirely unscientific for it
  ivji is closely allied to thought transmission or telepathy which according
  to serious students of the subject bids fair some day relatively soon to become
  an established science the chances are stacked high against any possibility that
  crystal gazing will at any time become a science but there is another element
  in it-the element of awakening the subconscious which according to psycholo-
  gists is ages old and has unlimited powers of penetration-which might be very
  interesting our new author has done a clever bit of work in weaving into a
  vivid tale this penetrative gaze into the possible future

                    illustrated by morey

a necromancer has or had until very
recently an office on sixth avenue in the
course of my business i used to pass his
office several times a day i rarely did so
without a smile of amusement that so bare-
faced a fraud should be allowed to continue in these
supposed civilized and enlightened times the star-
sprinkled hangings the odd statuettes-in a word all
the paraphernalia of a charlatan and a quack-were
exhibited in his temple of the mysterious as the
place was called

  then too the votaries of the temple were cause for
amusement most of them were fat ladies with poodles
they came in limousines and were bedecked with jewels
i used to remark to myself that here was a wise ma-
gician who accepted only the rich as his clients no
doubt he solved such problems for them as the nature of
their astral bodies and why fido had lost his appetite
for cream puffs

  one morning as i was walking past i saw a very
fat poodle waddle out of the place followed by an
even fatter woman accompanied by the necromancer
himself the woman was emphatically demanding to have

the poodles horoscope cast and the magician resented the
idea as an aspersion on his dignity

  i could not forbear laughing silently at the scene and
after the dowager had been driven off by a liveried
chauffeur the magician turned his attention to me

  you laugh meester johnson he said always
when you come by here you laugh you think i am
what you call a quack no

  he was a fine looking old man high narrow fore-
head black flashing eyes and a swarthy skin marked
him as belonging to some eastern race just now his
face was flushed and it was clear that he was much an-
noyed with me as i supposed for fully realizing his
charlatanism i was a little surprised at being called by
name but i knew it was frequently the practice of such
rogues as he to obtain information about others and
then use it at the most effective time

  why dont you cast the dogs horoscope i asked
contemptuously no doubt it would be as accurate as
most of your others

  his face grew still darker and then turned suddenly
pale

  so meester johnson he said you think i can not

look into the future or the past that i am a quack eh
come inside sar and you shall have a little demonstra-
tion

  i would have gone on as i did not desire to become
further involved in argument with such a person but
he said meester johnson the explorer the archeolo-
gist the historian and writer is afraid

  it was now my turn to flush i turned sharply and
brushing past the old man entered his temple he
conducted me through a kind of assembly room to a
small apartment hung with strange rich and somber
tapestries and with a soft and thick carpet on the floor
i remember that one of the tapestries represented the
twilight of the gods with the wolf fenris raging
among them on a small table was either a real skull
or a facsimile of one with a crystal ball set into the
top of it

  the magician motioned me to seat myself at one side
of this table while he sat down at the other

  meester johnson he said is noted for his articles
and stories dealing with long dead civilizations and an-
cient cults but he writes not of the future yet he would
like to do so he spends much time speculating about
the epochs to come

  i started how had this man fathomed a fact that i
had not even mentioned to my closest friends i did
think of the future and ardently desired to know what
kind of a civilization would follow our own my study
of ancient cults had trained me to think of life as a con-
tinuous chain in which the life of each individual is only
a tiny link i had frequently attempted to portray life
in pre-historic times and it was my dearest wish to be
able to write an authentic story of the future not per-
haps a great story-i had no wish for the dusty laurels
of a realist i wanted to write a story that would truly
represent life as it will be lived in some far distant era

  barely taking time to enjoy my discomfiture the old
man threw a little bluish powder into a charcoal brazier
which immediately flared up he placed it so that it was
in a line with the crystal ball from where i sat and
formed a kind of background for the ball

  look into the ball he said

  i looked at first only momentarily glancing then i
gazed more deeply and finally i looked with as great an
intensity as though my life depended on it

the air liner light of the western skies was taking
off from the docks in great manhattan it was
shortly after sunset and people in the streets of the city
gazed curiously as it rose toward the last rays of the
sunlight as the ship bathed itself in the dying light the
band on the deck struck up a gay air the light of the
western skies was one of the largest airships in the
world her decks were crowded with people on the
open deck protected only by wind-screens were the
control cabins the gun emplacements the promenade
deck-chairs and dance platforms for first class pas-
sengers and seats for the musicians

  it was a gay and careless crowd for the most part
officers and nobles in gorgeous uniforms and carrying
jeweled orders mingled with beautiful women dressed in
robes of textures and colors that would have made cleo-
patra despair servants in the dark red uniforms of
the consolidated airships company went to and fro
bearing refreshments and executing orders haughty
officers in the proud blue of the myrmidons stalked back

and forth clanking their swords and ogling any pretty
woman they happened to see the myrmidons them-
selves were at first grouped around their posts some
near the guns others in specially prepared positions but
as they saw their officers paying little attention to them
they slipped down to the second and third class decks to
dance or talk with friends among passengers or crew

  in the depths of the ship in hot and steamy compart-
ments the slaves watched over the mighty engines they
were careful very careful not to let the smallest accident
occur to the machinery for if the most trivial injury oc-
curred they would be severely punished their only
vision in life was to wrork and work until they died hop-
ing only that they might escape as much punishment as
possible

  to an outside observer the ship might have presented
an analogy of heaven earth and hell-the top deck
was heaven where everyone possessed all that he could
desire the middle deck earth where the employees of
the airships company and the lower class passengers had
quarters and the interior hell where the slaves labored
like black and grimy demons

  the ship followed fast in the track of the departing
sun but not even in the thousands of years that had
passed since man first learned to fly had airships reached
a speed sufficient to equal that of dawn or sunset so in
an hour or two darkness overtook the ship brilliant
lights were switched on and the gaiety on the upper
deck continued unabated

  an hour or two after dark the lights were suddenly
extinguished and at the same time the speed of the ship
was greatly increased a murmur of surprise and
consternation swept through the passengers what
could be the cause of such unusual procedure soon
the word was passed around that a suspicious-looking
ship which refused to answer any radio signals had
been sighted by the lookout the radio operators had
immediately attempted to send word to the patrolling
cruisers of the airships company but the strange craft
had set up a field of artificially produced electrical waves
that prevented any intelligible messages from either being
sent or coming through the passengers were advised
to go below to their cabins and the myrmidons were
ordered to their combat posts

  the strange ship at first barely visible in the light of a
rising moon approached rapidly there was the report
of a gun from its forward deck and a phosphorous shell
burst across the bows of the liner this was the inter-
national signal to heave to the liner answered by a
broadside of all its available guns several of the shells
were seen to burst on the strange craft which could now
be made out as a swift cruiser

  it soon became clear in the struggle that followed that
the cruiser was to have much the best of it it moved
almost two feet to the liners one it maneuvered more
quickly and easily and most important of all it was
evidently commanded by an expert in aerial warfare

  the liner dropped rose circled and dipped-all to no
avail the cruiser quickly obtained a commanding po-
sition above it and swooped low over it raking its decks
with gunfire it was evident that they disdained to drop
bombs

  a few of the passengers on the upper deck had ne-
glected to obey the advice to seek the safety of their
cabins and now stood watching the conflict from the
partial shelter of companion way entrances and cabin
the raid of the mercury



doors one of these was a young man dressed in a
white robe with a purple border which proclaimed him
to be of the highest rank he had taken no part in the
dancing and flirting which had occupied most of the pas-
sengers at the time the lights were extinguished he had
been dictating to an enormous slave amenuensis as
soon as he heard the explanation for putting the ship in
preparedness for battle he had taken shelter in a cabin
doorway and remained an interested but imperturbable
spectator occasionally he made some observation on
the trend of events seeming to speak rather to himself
than to the slave now as it became apparent that the
keel guns of the cruiser were making it impossible for
the defenders to remain at their guns he muttered to
himself the captain is a fool if he keeps this up he
will soon have no men left at all his only chance is to
order his men into shelter in hopes that the pirates will
be foolish enough to board

  seeing the captain in the shelter of a hatch some dis-
tance away he coolly walked across the deck disregard-
ing the fact that he was exposed to a very dangerous fire
and communicated this observation to him the captain
received his advice with great respect and acted on it
at once the myrmidons were ordered to leave the guns
and conceal themselves as best they might about the deck

  the sudden cessation of fire evidently puzzled the
attacking ship it circled low over the liner in an attempt
to find the cause for the sudden abandonment of the de-
fense and apparently satisfied that the defenders were
practically routed it finally came alongside and began to
land a boarding party the young man who by the
tacit assent of the captain seemed to have taken com-
mand of the defense of the liner coolly waited until a
fair half of the boarding party had reached the deck and
then ordered the vertical propellers reversed which
course violently wrenched the two ships apart dropping
the liner a thousand feet or more this course was
cleverly calculated to maroon the attackers so that they
might be overwhelmed before assistance could reach them

-	but the attackers showed their mettle instead of
waiting to be rushed by the myrmidons who were now
coming out of their hiding places the others took the
initiative lead by a fair-haired blue-eyed young man
they rushed forward to the attack armed with the long
slightly curved swords suitable for either cutting or
thrusiirx which the experience of thousands of years
had shown to be mans most formidable weapon for
hand-to-hand fighting they surged forward in a shouting
whoopcheering mass the impetuosity of their
charge swept all before it for a time the myrmidons
were caught separated in small groups and were cut
separate-- the sword play of the leader of the in-
vaders was a fearful and beautiful thing to see dressed
in the she rt belted tunic which is the uniform of all atmen
and which admirably set off his perfection of bodily
strength he moved among the defenders like a raging
god broad shouldered deep chested slender of waist
and hips muscular of arm and leg quick and graceful
as a leaping panther his blade was repeatedly dyed with
the blood of the defenders using edge and point with
equal skill he alternately beat down the guard of some
stalwart myrmidon by brute force and then pausing
only long enough to wrench his blade free he would use
superior skill and speed to thrust the point deep into the
body of another his blue eyes flashed with cold fire
and his lips were slightly curved in a mocking smile

  that he was not unknown to the defenders was shown
by an observation the leader of the defense made to the
captain

  it is prince james and his revolutionaries he
calmly remarked i thought as much after i saw the
skill with which the cruiser was handled by midas he
is a noble fighting man

  another passenger also was watching the leader of
the invaders she was a tall slender girl who was
sheltered deep in the entrance of a cabin door evi-
dently of the highest rank she was accompanied by two
or three slave girls who incessantly begged her to take
refuge in the depths of the ship she refused

  i must see this she said it is james and the
cruiser is the mercury i am sure is he not handsome
esmeralda and he plays his part like a true man
had he but written me what he intended i would have
come to his side though he had been pronounced traitor
and pirate by all the nations on earth

  meanwhile the fight had commenced to go against the
young atman and his followers the leader of the de-
fense had coolly allowed several groups of the defenders
to be routed in order to give him time to organize the
rest now this had been done and two cohorts were at-
tacking the invaders directly from the front while sharp-
shooters and rapid-fire gunners poured in a destructive
hail of shot from the flanks

  the leader of the defenders himself apparently un-
armed and taking no personal part in the struggle
watched the consummation of his wise plans with con-
siderable pleasure the invaders seemed to be on the
verge of being wiped out but he had counted without
the interference from the cruiser this ship now re-
entered the battle it took up a position directly above
the liner and sprayed its decks with its keel rapid-fire
guns the gunners on the lower ship were unable to
damage the cruiser from the bottom as it was here that
its protective armor was thickest and were soon forced
to desert their posts the captain dropped dipped
and whirled his ship as rapidly as possible in a mad
attempt to dislodge the cruiser from its commanding po-
sition but in vain the cruiser could maneuver much
more easily and it stuck to its position like a mongoose
to the neck of a cobra

  the defenders went down like grain before the reaper
the passenger who had assumed command saw the
hopelessness of the situation and himself ran up the
white flag to the masthead and ordered the few remain-
ing defenders to throw down their arms

  the young atman of the invaders took command of
the ship and slowly dropped it to the ground a few
minutes later the cruiser landed beside it the field
where they landed was part of a boundless plain in the
middle west like almost all of the country since men
had learned to make their food in factories it was ab-
solutely void of all human occupation

  the lights were switched on the crew of the
mercury which name could now be made out on the
hull of the cruiser methodically searched the liner re-
moving whatever they wanted in the way of food am-
munition clothes or other stores on deck the atman
who had now been joined by a short thickset man
dressed in the uniform of a chief gunner who was evi-
dently his second in command ordered the passengers
and crew of the light of the western skies lined up
for inspection


amazing stories

  as he walked slowly down the line he saw the leader
of the defenders and stopped with a cry of surprise

  well he said in a cold voice this is a piece of
luck lothaire prince of the second cycle vice-pon-
tiff of the plutocracy who would have suspected that
you would fall into my hands we have a few scores
to settle prince do you remember when you led the
armies of the plutocracy against my estates in the
south my father and sister were killed in the sack of
the town of the oaks and it was you who commanded
the troops i am very glad to see you again prince
then turning to his second in command he continued
say you not so aurelius you were present at the
sack of the town of the oaks

  aye prince was the reply he is the ablest devil
in the council of midas or in the whole administration
of the plutocracy

  the person addressed as lothaire replied calmly and
haughtily what i did then i did as the servant of the
plutocracy and i am not ashamed of it you brought
your fate upon yourself you might have stood high
in the councils of the plutocracy none had a better
chance you had youth ability great wealth and a
great name but you preferred to espouse the cause of
the people as you call it and see what it has bought
you-the speaker gestured toward a placard that was
fastened to an adjacent wind-screen-there is a price
on your head that poster offers a reward for your
capture the grand council of the plutocracy has for-
feited your estates the name of james lancaster
prince of the second cycle is now coupled -with the
terms traitor and pirate even at the present moment
the ships of the plutocracy are probably closing in on
you to mete out the fate you deserve

  prince james flushed violently and started with rage
at the word traitor but he controlled himself scorning
to strike a prisoner and said with a slight smile thanks
for reminding me of that fact prince then to his
second in command aurelius send out ten scouts in
the gliders let them cover every direction and report
the approach of any ship turning back to the prisoner
he continued you shall answer for your words as
well as your deeds lothaire it ill becomes you who
are known as the most coldly cruel general of the pluto-
cracy to cast epithets at others you know that you
have been tried and condemned by the black groups
what if i turned you over to them for execution but
more of this later

  continuing his inspection of the prisoners he came
to where stood the girl who had spoken of him to her
maid on seeing her his face lit up with pleasure and
he rushed forward saying avice you in america
why didnt you answer my letters  i thought you must
have thrown me over as most of my friends did when
i espoused the cause of the people

  then as the girl did not move he said anxiously
you havent have you

  you wrote james the girl asked i never re-
ceived your letters they must have been intercepted by
the secret agents of the plutocracy i know that i have
been watched i thought that you had deserted me and
so i came to america to see but james you need never
be afraid of being thrown over by me it was i who in-
duced your father to suggest our engagement i have
loved you since we used to play together as little children
at the villa cumberland

  thank god he said and caught her in his arms as
though he would never let her go

  prince lothaire watched this scene with the keenest

r

interest and as it attracted the attention of the guards
from him he moved to take advantage of it the one-
man gliders that james had ordered sent out were now
poised on the deck of the liner ready to take off lothaire
took a step or two forward and clapped one of the men
who was just about to take off in a glider on the shoul-
der in a friendly way saying hello anderson

  the man thinking he was mistaken for another
turned unguardedly lothaire seized a dagger from his
belt and with the smooth speed of a striking snake
plunged it up to the hilt into the mans body then be-
fore the already lifeless body could fall he had moved
behind the man and on to the glider starting the small
butefficient motor with which it was equipped he slip-
ped over the side of the liner and plunged toward the
ground to gather speed quickly he straightened out so
close to the ground as to brush the grass then keeping
the liner between himself and the guns of the cruiser
he was off like an arrow

  the consummate coolness and cunning of his escape
left his captors so astounded that no effective action was
taken until too late a few hasty and ill-directed shots
were fired and the other gliders left in quick pursuit but
the darkness of the night and the almost absolute silence
with which the glider moved prevented any real hope
of success

  james was plainly worried by this successful escape of
the prisoner he turned to his second in command
how soon can we leave aurelius lothaire will have
the cruisers of the plutocracy about our ears in an hour
at the latest

  it will take at least half an hour to transfer the
stores we need prince then too one of their shells has
damaged the port horizontal propeller and that will
cut down our speed considerably

  it was certainly an unfortunate escape said james
for we are sure to have to encounter lothaire again
later but-here he smiled at a vice-no day on which
i find you again could be anything but supremely happy
no matter what else occurred

  the girl smiled happily tell me about yourself
james she said it is two years since i saw you
you know and then i had no idea that you were to be-
come a famous revolutionary you were interested in
sports and aviation then instead of political affairs
what caused this change was it your father i
remember he wrote several books dealing with the in-
justice of slavery and the rights of the people

  yes it was my father he said you see he didnt
stop at writing he made speeches and had them broad-
cast to the four corners of the world the plutocracy
didnt like his books but he was an independent prince
so they let him alone but when he began to have his
speeches broadcast to the slaves and people they sent
to arrest him as an independent prince he refused to
be arrested then they sent an army and surrounded
him in the town of the oaks i was on a hunting trip
in the west and didnt hear about it until after it was too
late aurelius was there and he tells me they put up a
gallant defense except for lothaires skill and cun-
ning they would have escaped dad who had never
had a sword in his hand before in his life died in the
breach in the town wall when it became evident that
the raid of the mercury



the town was to be sacked mary my sister took poison
aurelius was wounded and left for dead he was saved
by some former slaves that father had freed they tried
to get me too when i came back from my hunting trip
but some member of the black groups warned me and
i got away on the yacht it was then i swore vengeance
on the plutocracy and lothaire i turned the yacht
into a cruiser manned it with the slaves dad had freed
and who remained faithful and preyed on the commerce
of the plutocracy ever since i do not intend to rest
until fathers ideas are carried out the slaves are freed
and there is justice in the courts for all

   as soon as i decided on this course i realized that my
 position was very different from the one i held when
 we were engaged so i wrote you asking if you pre-
 ferred to break off the engagement or live the life of
 a pirates wife when i did not hear from you i was
 very much afraid that i would have to go on alone

  i would be with you anywhere james she said
but with the combined power of our principalities we
should be able to gain your point even against the pluto-
cracy since my fathers death i am princess of
orleans duchess of the cumberlands and countess of
the delta together we control almost a fifth of the
country

   james shook his head

   some of my estates are far separated you know he
 said and though i believe the artisans and people gen-
 erally would support me if they dared i do not think
 they will have the courage to do so the kingdom of
 the south which was our main support has been badly
 ravaged it is more likely that you will only lose your
 estates in addition still i feel sure we will win finally
 the black groups have given me some aid already and
 they will continue to co-operate with us i do not ap-
 prove of their policy af assassination still i have had
 to admit that it is the only thing that has held the pluto-
 cracy in check at all

   here aurelius reported the transfer of stores com-
 plete james ordered the slaves on the liner turned loose
 and allowed some of them who had had experience
 either as soldiers or machinery workers to join his crew
 the passengers and the myrmidons were left unmolest-
 ed the invaders withdrew to the mercury accom-
 panied by the princess avice and two of her slaves it
 was s -n found that they had taken their departure none
 too soon for the scouts sent out in the gliders came back
 at top speed and reported a fleet of large ships approach-
 ing from the east and north james went to the control
 cabin and laid a course almost due south along the
 ancient river valley of the mississippi he ordered full
 speed for both vertical and horizontal propellers the
 mercury was a wonderfully swift yacht built for speed
 but wh the damage to the propeller he doubted if he
 could distance the ships behind him he knew that they
 would be spread out fan-wise with delicate listening
 apparatus tuned to discover the sound of his motors so
 he hoped to outwit them by rising which would lessen
 the distance that his motors could be heard since sound
 is carried by air waves and in the rarefied air of great
 heights audibility is much decreased

   the vertical propellers hidden deep within their air
 shafts which were so arranged as to force out a dense
 column of air from the bottom of the ship thus helping
 it to rise in somewhat the same manner that a squid pro-
 pels itself through the water hummed with a steadily

rising note as they gained speed the mercury rose
swiftly and soon all hands were ordered below decks to
protect them from the cold and rarefied air of the great
height in the control cabin of polished ebony and ma-
hogany james and avice sat on a bench waiting
anxiously for a report from the master electrician his
report will determine whether or not the fleet had picked
up their trail

  do you remember where our estates adjoin in the
cumberland mountains asked james

  of course answered avice i got many a lecture
from my governess for sneaking off from the villa cum-
berland to play with you

  well that is where we are going said james we
have a secret stronghold near there we should reach it
in a few hours

  aurelius entered

  the master electrician reports that a large fleet is un-
doubtedly following us and gaining on us fast he said

  drop the ship within five hundred feet of the earth
at once ordered james our plan has failed we
must depend on speed now and the propellers cant get
a good grip on the air at this altitude

  after the ship had reached the thicker air of the lower
altitudes the pursuing fleet gained much more slowly
but they still gained and the number of pursuers
steadily increased as ships signaled in advance joined
the pursuit by keeping up a strong and continuous field
of static the electrician on the mercury interfered with
these signals as much as possible and prevented any in-
telligible messages from being sent to ships in the di-
rection in which the mercury was moving in that way
the ships were not headed off but new ones steadily
joined the pursuers from flank and rear

  the chase lasted for some hours the pursuers were
much closer and the dawn was lightening the sky in the
east james had gradually turned east of south and was
now over the western foothill of the southern appala-
chians in order to lose no time in vertical movements
he was following the carefully engineered track of an
org line this wonderful invention embodying a
series of electro-magnets arranged in a half circle so
that a paramagnetic body would be held at the center and
by being equally attracted from below and both sides
would be supported in the air a few feet from the
ground appearing to stay there by magic now carried
the freight traffic of the country at great speeds the
electric circuits were so arranged that certain magnets
in front of any car traveling on the line pulled it for-
ward and then when it passed the pole was automati-
cally changed and it was repelled in this way cargoes
of great bulk were speedily transferred in metal cars
without any crew or pilot

  as the sky slowly grew brighter it became possible to
make out the pursuing fleet it seemed to be composed
of large ships to james experienced eye they appeared
to be battle-cruisers a shell that burst some distance
away made him aware that they also could be seen by
the pursuers a large mountain loomed ahead into
which the org line bored in a tunnel the situation was
desperate for the delay necessary to rise over the moun-
tain would be fatal the crew were aware of their pre-
dicament and either stood around the windshields watch-
ing the pursuing fleet with hopless hate in their eyes or
busied themselves in preparing the guns of the cruiser
for a last desperate battle most of them would be


amazing stories

treated as runaway slaves if they were captured and they
preferred to die at their posts aurelius brave and
stanch of heart as his peerless roman namesake fin-
gered his long heavy sword and suggested that since they
must fight they should turn back and board the flagship
in which he did not doubt lothaire to be saying that he
could die happy if he first saw his blade bury itself
in lothaires body avice de loyola brave as any of
her illustrious ancesters who had been noted for their
courage for hundreds of years stood quietly-very pale
but composed

  since we must die my prince she said let us show
them that we know how to die bravely i am glad that
we are together

  james looked at her in desperation

  no he said it shall not be you are too young
and beautiful to die there must be some way out if
only that mountain were not there if we lose time to
rise over it they will get us with a shell but if we
had a little start we might be able to escape for their
cursed listening devices will not work among the echoes
and air currents of these hills

  then he saw the gaping mouth of the org tunnel and
a desperate plan flashed into his mind

  all is not lost he announced coolly there is still
one chance a desperate one but still a chance

  he stepped to the open bridge and took the controls
straight toward the mouth of the tunnel he headed the
tunnel was terribly small for his plan should they strike
an org car coming in the other direction at the speed at
which they were moving they would be reduced to dust
but it seemed their only alternative another danger was
that of being forced against the roof or wall of the tun-
nel as the darkness closed over them he heard avice
gasp aurelius ruddy face turned almost white but
he stood quietly with a grim smile on his face this was
the kind of thing he admired and for which he followed
his young leader with boundless devotion courage and
audacity where could there be a better leader 

  the tunnel was fifteen miles long but it hardly seemed
that they were in it a minute to james it was just a
long stretch of smooth walls illuminated by the search-
light and blurred by the speed with which he passed
then they shot out into the open air again and just as
they rose from the org line a cigar shaped car al-
most as large as the cruiser suddenly loomed out of the
dim morning light ahead and shot past below with the
speed of thought james raised his hand to his forehead
and found it damp with perspiration at the narrowness
of their escape if they had met the org car in the
tunnel they would never have known what struck them

  james steered the ship down a sheltering valley at
right angles to their former course then he changed
the course several times dropping deep into mountain
valleys and hurtling through passes at top speed when
after a half hour of this the master electrician reported
no sound of the pursuing fleet he knew that they were
safe he headed straight for their stronghold a few
minutes later he brought the ship low over the rushing
waters of a swift mountain stream after following its
course for a short distance the dark entrance of a mighty
cavern showed to their left by skillful maneuvering
he brought the mercury to rest in this natural hangar

completely concealed from the keen eyes of the hundreds
of aerial scouts that he knew would soon be on the look-
out for them under the eye of the searchlight the
cavern disclosed itself as containing galleries and pas
sages that might conceal an army a small body of his
men that had been left behind either to guard the strong-
hold or because they were unfit for the strenuous work
of the expedition rushed forward to unload the ship and
congratulate them on the successful outcome of their ex-
pedition when it was learned that james had brought
back his future wrife and that she was avice who was
noted for her generosity kindliness and wealth an im-
promptu celebration was staged

  a few hours later they were married the impressive
and dignified ceremony was performed before a natural
altar in the rock the scene was lit by the ruddy glare
of a great fire james stood tall and proud and very
happy with his officers and friends grouped behind him

  avice with hair as black as night and skin of the tint
of pale ivory stood at his side with her maids behind her
her gorgeous robes and jewels taken from the small
amount of baggage she had had time to bring with her
made her look even more than ever the beautiful woman
and great princess that she was the gossamer fabrics
in the fashion of the day only partially concealed the
beautifully rounded perfection of her form the fire-
light glinted from her hair illuminated the soft and
warm flesh of her throat and shoulders and sparkled in
her eyes in a way that put to shame her splendid jewels

  the ceremony was performed by aurelius who had
been made a tribune by prince edward james father
as the concluding words were said avice and james
blended their lips in one long kiss a thousand swords
flashed from their scabbards and a mighty shout rent
the air long life and happiness to our king and
queen success to our cause

	 

 returned to full consciousness very slowly it
was with a start that i realized that the sun was
shining on the stained glass windows in the west of
the room and that it must be late afternoon i must have
been in some kind of trance looking into the crystal
ball for hours i turned my attention to the crystal
again it was as clear and limpid as a mountain stream
no vestige of the wild scenes that i had gazed at within
its depths remained nor did the most prolonged scru-
tiny restore them the ball remained mockingly clear
i rose from the beautifully carved chair with my feet
sinking into the soft carpet and looked around for the
old magician there was no one in the room save myself
still partially dazed i walked from the room and out
into the street as i passed out it seemed to me that
i heard someone laughing softly to himself

  i went to my rooms and turned what little skill i had
into writing the story of what i had seen in the crystal
ball this story i now give to you for what it is worth
i do not assert its veracity i do not attempt to explain
it it may be merely the wild dreams of a man under
the influence of whatever drug the old magician used in
the charcoal brazier it may be some slight glimpse
of the lives that people on this planet will live in the far
distant future let each man decide for himself

  two years have passed since those events took place
yet i can see them as clearly as if they had occurred but
yesterday for three months after the canal was blasted
through the wall of coseguina the pacific continued to
flow into the shaft then the whirlpool disappeared and
a level crater lake was formed hax told us that it was
impossible for the nether world to have been completely
filled with water in that time-that its inhabitants must
have found some way to stem the flow

  he may be right i do not know nor do i care much
so long as its slimy intelligences are kept where they be-

animal the name myomycetes means slime fungus the
idea of the animal relationship is generally thrown out
although some still consider the fungus as belonging to
the lowest order of animals the dispute indicated is an
old one the english language name is slime moulds
they increase by division and finally aggregate or fuse
into masses of protoplasm called plasmodia these
masses are oftenfound on decaying logs

a good many of our readers will remember the enterprising scientists of
ujl the moon strollers fame which story we published in the may 
issue of amazing stories and will be glad to welcome them back at this time
these adventurers brought all kinds of geological specimens from the moon all
of which we believed they had turned over to the museum but our scientist-
heroes confess here to having withheld at least one thing-a chrysalis but they
had good reason for doing this as you will agree after you have read this story

frederick scoefield sat at his office

desk perusing the mornings mail after an
absence of nearly four months he was ener-
getically pulling together the loose ends of his
rapidly growing engineering business despite
his amazing adventure and sudden wealth he did not
intend to lead a life of idleness things certainly needed
personal attention for no matter how competent sub-
ordinates were they always lacked his initiative his
daring imagination as he sorted the letters into two
piles-business and personal-his hand picked up the
familiar sky-blue envelope of the astronomical club he
smiled as he turned over the letter and glanced at the
constellation of white stars printed on the back to indi-
cate the current month his smile gave utterance to an
exclamation of interest as he read the following notice

    regular august meeting of the astronomical
  club at the shack the third week-end as usual the
  program will include the initiation of professor ken-
  worthy into membership and dr mueller promises
  some fun cracking open a number of geodes and red
  shale fossils from his private collection

                        respectfully yours

                              r c burroughs

secretary

  scoefield leaned over to his desk calendar and marked
a cross on friday august   and then he dropped
the envelope and notice into the basket he was the last
person to leave the office at five-fifteen he fought his
way into a subway train and shot out to his suburban
apartment

   at five-thirty a janitor entered the offices of scoefield
and company general engineering and proceeded to
clean out the waste baskets and sweep the floors anyone
peering through the office door mail-slot might have seen
him on his knees sorting through the eight wire baskets
letter by letter until he found the blue envelope and the
notice beneath it he now acted in an unusual manner
for janitors for he carefully placed these treasures in
a larger stamped envelope which he carried in an inside
pocket of his vest leaving the office door open he
quickly walked down the hall and taking the envelope
he had just filled deposited it in the mail-chute

  the next morning this letter found its way to the
desk of a free-lance writer for a popular scientific
monthly each month he dug up a scare-head leading
article of advanced news he was known at the office
as mr hawk and the magazine closed its eyes to his
news-gathering methods because his stuff was popular
and helped put the publication over with half a million
copies per month an odd type of person with a neu-
rotic taste for the quasi-scientific he had studied just
enough science to kill his morals and religion with an
insatiable curiosity he was always delving for the un-
published facts

  this person also marked the date on his calendar and
then burned the letter

  as scoefield rode out to his home he mused over
the events of the past four months it seemed incredible
that he had become a second lindbergh been feted and
honored by the leading scientific societies in the world
the sheer nerve and daring of that rocket trip to the
moon jules vernes prophecy actually carried out
successfully his back-breaking labor day by day with

the head with huge single leased eyes turned on an axis
from side to side as it looked around the table with a
doleful and apprehensive stare  its wings nozv
fluttered spasmodically as wave on wave of nerve dead-
ening perfume stupefied the senses




amazing stories

professor kenworthy and dr mueller in exploration
over the moons dead surface the beautiful minerals
and fossils he had gathered for mueller the agonizing
suspense of the return trip the crash and injuries in the
andes mountains then-ovations endless handshaking
and photography his present disguise to avoid being
pestered and now-the quiet routine of the engineering
business all over again

  several weeks later two men waited at the grand
central station for a noon train to carry them up into
vermont one hoped to get a few days rest and re-
laxation with old friends away from the citys roar and
heat the other to spy and steal if need be

the sun had just dipped behind the rolling hills and
a faint mist was settling into the valley when scoe-
fields train arrived in the little town of oakdale
quite a few people alighted vacationists farmers sev-
eral salesmen some women and children and lastly a
man with a full beard who seemed very particular about
the careful unloading of his motorcycle from the bag-
gage car scoefield threaded his way through the group
of passengers on the platform and got into the waiting
buggy of lem thompson lem was an old-time
farmer rich in land but stringent for ready money he
leased one of his hilltops to the astronomical club and
depended upon them for a considerable part of his in-
come the two men chatted intermittently as they
jolted over the eight-mile drive to the shack

  i reckon you fellows are goin to have some kind
of a reunion up there ive hauled darn near the whole
club in the past two days

  yes everybody likes to get away from the city
during august

  i had to make an extra trip for dr mueller he
brought up two packin cases i had to get some of
the boys down at the station to help load em on i
reckon i would have hitched up a double team had i
knowed how heavy they was

  yes mr thompson some supplies no doubt the
doctor is making a larger telescope this summer
darkness had settled over the hilltop as lem thomp-
son drew up his team where a path cut back from the
dirt road scoefield got out took his bag from the
rear and bid goodbye to the old farmer as he strode
up the path to the shack he was conscious of a chill in
the night air denoting that the short summer was draw-
ing to its close his ear always in tune to the sounds
of nature caught an odd droning sound coming up from
the valley a flivver he thought trying to navigate
that dirt road-must be taking the rough spots in low
he reached the shack a moment later with its twinkling
lights and thin column of blue-gray smoke ascending
from the chimney as he entered a roaring fire the
cheery circle of old friends and the aroma of roast pork
with new england baked beans greeted him well
well here comes the returning hero come on boys all
together-tor hes a jolly good fellow for hes a jolly
good fellow every man was on his feet shaking
hands with fred dinner was just being served scoe-
field took his customary place and at once joined in the
noisy conversation

  no cooking this trip fred shouted dr mueller
from the tables end donnelly sent up his colored
man and we are having a combination of both new
england and southern cooking

  suits mereplied scoefield i am ready to eat any-
thing after that long ride up from the city

  then spying kenworthy at the other end he bantered
hello kenny i thought being a professional astrono-
mer you would be too holy to join this club of ama-
teurs 

  no fred i consider the invitation to spend the
week-end here a signal honor there hasnt been a
dull moment

  just wait professor until mueller starts talking
about his minerals then you can cover up for the night
blurted out burroughs everybody roared and the
doctor promptly retorted i shall get even for that re-
mark by giving my discussion in scientific german
whereupon the men around the table roared even
louder and holding up their coffee cups to mueller sang
again for hes a jolly good fellow for hes a jolly
good fellow

  shortly the big pine table was cleared havanas were
lighted and the men relaxed while mueller rummaged
through his cases and laid the geological specimens one
by one on the table after cleaning and adjusting his
glasses he began

  you gentlemen know that in the exclusive story of
our exploration to the moon which fred sold to the
associated press there were mentioned  geological
specimens besides those basalt disks which we brought
back i saw fit to give the smithsonian institute 
specimens which i identified and labeled during our fall
back to earth presumably the remainder not mentioned
were either duplicates or worthless at any rate no
questions were asked about them and as far as i know
the public thinks they have the entire collection

  for my part after risking life and limb i felt en-
titled to retain such material as i have here until this
club could examine and study it at leisure in fact this
shack is the only place in the world where i can do any
uninterrupted work i expect to remain here for another
month at least

  now then bring the lamps closer and pass around
these minerals from hand to hand the science of fossils
is as you know called palaeontology it is a very
broad subject with new discoveries constantly extend-
ing the field it has now several distinct divisions
among which may be mentioned palaeobotany concern-
ing itself with the ancient forms of vegetable life as
an example please examine these fern fronds beautiful
specimens and dating from the moons carboniferous
period probably millions of years before corresponding
terrestrial conditions they are identical with clado-
phlebis denticiilata found in english inferior oolite
adding as if does another of the now overwhelming
proofs of the universality of the evolutionary processes

  on the other hand i have here samples of red shale
which may be only ten thousand years old or dating
from the last great cataclysm which rendered the moon
uninhabitable for flora or fauna as we understand it

  we have striking evidence that in the moons death
agony a series of frightful earthquakes occurred open-
ing up gigantic fissures in the surface into which the once
abundant seas disappeared in these cosmic disturb-
ances whole verdant areas must have been suddenly in-
undated followed by violent sand storms and then by
burning sun-heat in this way these red shale fossils
have been formed they are a very prolific source of
information however those of you who are more in-
the stolen chrysalis



terested in mineralogy than botany get a couple of small
hammers out of the laboratory and crack open these
geodes if someone will get me a chisel i would like to
split down this block first

during the interval of getting tools heads were
bent together specimens were passed around and
everybody talked at once

  fred come help me hold this piece on edge while i
try to split through this dark vein a light blow and
the stone crumbled under hand it was so soft and
porous they all leaned forward to see the contents
there it was a spray of leaves on a twig just as fresh
and green as if plucked yesterday and partly hidden be-
tween the leaves a brown egg-shaped object ridged
and mottled holding up the strange thing mueller
asked what is it pass it over here answered
skidmore who was a natural history fan

  gentlemen he said this is a fossil chrysalis of a
huge cutter fly with probably a wing span of fourteen
or sixteen inches very rare and very interesting in-
deed

  what makes you think it is a fossil  spoke up scoe-
field it may be living

  well that is easy to try said mueller someone
bring me a bowl of warm water the thing was thrust
into the water and all eyes were focused the seconds
lengthened into minutes give it time to warm up
said mueller but hardly had he uttered these words
when the thing began to squirm and jump like a mexican
jumping bean the astonishment of the men can be im-
agined everybody talked at once and skidmore now
took the stage tell me doctor how do you account
for such a miraculous preservation after these thou-
sands of years he questioned i cannot account for
it it is simply one of those strange freaks of nature
which the scientist encounters occasionally to baffle and
upset our fine theories and speculations all that could
be said is that a rare combination of insulation together
with oxygen-bearing ores sealed and kept vitalized the
twig and chrysalis

  do you suppose the chrysalis will hatch everyone
asked

  why not he answered and if it does it will re-
present the moons last living creature we will put
it in a little wire cage under the laboratory skylight and
let the heat of the sun do the rest

  this fossil proved to be the piece de resistance of
the evening the remainder held but casual interest for
the men in a very short time the discussion became
general and when the chrysalis had been properly dis-
posed of it ceased to be a subject of speculation the
night was particularly fine several of the men wanted
to search for a new comet recently reported from the
harvard observatory so it was well after two oclock
before all lights were out and the symphony of crickets
in the high brush around the shack was augmented by
the breathing of a dozen men

  about ten oclock next morning skidmore entered the
laboratory to get his graflex camera he had left it 
the big work table under the skylight near the little im-
provised cage glancing toward it he was surprised to
see the netting neatly slit open the chrysalis gone and in
its place a short note scrawled in lead pencil on the mar-
gin of a scrap of daily newspaper he picked it up and
read the following

     gentlemen i regret to deprive you of your little
  treasure but i also possess scientific curiosity and
  have no qualms since this is undoubtedly the right-
  ful property of the smithsonian institute

  skidmore rushed back into the living room where the
men were tumbling out of their bunks or getting dressed
for breakfast

  they were electrified by the news and rushed in a
body into the laboratory to look at the empty cage

  why the devil didnt he take some of our money and
let the chrysalis alone blurted out mueller who now
appeared in very baggy pajamas

  now dont get your dutch up doc retorted ken-
worthy let us sit down to breakfast and calmly
analyze this theft

  thats right professor you are somewhat of an
amateur detective if all the reports from chicago are
true added scoefield

  in truth the noted astronomer was an insatiable con-
sumer of detective stories and criminology interested him
as a divergent line of thought the savory odor of perco-
lating coffee hot bread bacon and eggs assailed the
nostrils appetites were keen and once again the big
table resounded to a noisy meal

  mr skidmore please give me that note id like to
glance at it for a moment requested professor ken-
worthy after the breakfast was well under way he
scrutinized it carefully and then turning to the men said
i feel certain that the mere writing of this note will
prove the thiefs undoing it indicates a small and ego-
tistical type of mind that would take time to express his
taunts at the risk of discovery the reference to the
smithsonian institute is simply to throw us off the
trail it is unthinkable that anyone on that staff would
be involved

  good good professor several shouted while dr
mueller interrupted to say i know the smithsonian
people personally they are a very loyal and worthy
group you can rest assured they had nothing to do
with this

  all right now to proceed further continued ken-
worthy this piece of paper is of such poor quality that
it is certainly a scrap of one of new yorks dailies the
local vermont papers with their small circulations is-
sued once or twice a week usually print on heavier
weight and whiter quality the very fact that mr skid-
mores lens which was on the work table beside the
chrysalis was not taken shows that we are not dealing
with a common crook the motive must have been
curiosity or probably material for a story for one of
the cheaper popular science journals they are usually
hard pressed for something new and astonishing

hen i received the invitation to spend the week-
end here as i recall it came in a blue envelope
with a constellation printed on the back that is a very
startling and original manner of reminding club members
of the meetings but it is also a source of leakage in your
seclusion you men come up here to get away from the
cares of big business there is no telephone no stock
ticker the place is inaccessible except by a dirt road over
the hills you depend on mr thompson for food sup-
ply and haulage back and forth to the village you go
to a great deal of trouble to get seclusion and then ad-
vertise your meetings to the world in this way


amazing stories

  let us presume that one of these invitations fell into
the hands of a reporter he would come up here and
follow one of us out to the shack it is too far to walk
and there are no livery stables any more where one can
hire a horse he must keep within sight of the person
he is following so he would probably use a motorcycle
i was very fond of this sport as a high school boy and
by picking the good edges i could travel any road

  wait wait professor interrupted scoefield there
was a motorcycle unloaded at the station and i think i
heard it down in the valley as i was walking up to the
shack

  very good watson retorted kenworthy smiling
the table roared and shouted go on go on

  having established this faint clue we may presume
that our covetous friend came well-equipped he may
have gone so far as to have a pair of head phones sev-
eral hundred feet of telephone wire and a small micro-
phone which could be attached near one of the open win-
dows this equipped and astride one of those big oaks
yonder with a pair of high power binoculars he prob-
ably enjoyed the evening about as much as we did ex-
cept that he may have gotten chilly and cramped in his
position i hope he did

  if i thought for an instant that this man could be
apprehended before he got back to new york we might
commission fred to hustle down to the farm saddle a
horse and dash into the village like paul revere how-
ever i understand from mr thompson that there are
but two trains a day leaving for new york the milk
train pulling out around three oclock in the morning
and the second one at noon rest assured our scien-
tific friend caught the milk train he is not loitering
around oakdale this morning or he may have motored
south to the next town got his breakfast and waited for
the last train

  let us assume that he returns to new york he
will immediately go to his rooms and rig up a cage
similar to the one we have here if he has no direct sun-
light he may try to hatch the chrysalis with a sunray
lamp

  it is only by the process of elimination that method
so ably employed by sherlock holmes that we could
possibly trace this fellow after he arrives in the metropo-
lis let us assume he is a reporter what paper does he
work for i dont think the daily papers are a serious
consideration although there are eight or ten sunday
papers which usually run one or more popular science
articles in their magazine sections these inaccurate and
grossly exaggerated space fillers are nearly always
signed and seldom deal with entomology earthquakes
microbes in drinking water monkey glands and mon-
strosities are the usual themes if we dispose of the
newspapers and search among the scientific journals we
probably could narrow considerably the horizon you
men are not only contributors but are acquainted with
many of the writers for these publications

  suppose we go to the editor of one of the leaders say
science and invention in the editorial offices we can
obtain access to the exchanges and from them get prob-
ably half a dozen editors names go to these men con-
fidentially in the name of the astronomical club state
the facts and if i am not very much mistaken you will
get a list of names maybe ten or twenty it will be
exasperating running down these men so many wild
goose chases but you will find that they know each

other and somebody wanting a legitimate story may
squeal it is possible that the whole search could be
wound up on monday there is no use going to print-
ing house row today or sunday editors are away
over week-ends just as we are on the other hand it
may be too late when chrysalis decides to hatch it
loses no time

  that is so interrupted skidmore they usually
hatch between nine and four on sunny windless days
and never in rainy weather

  ill go ill go cried scoefield at this point we
traveled half a million miles for these fossils and we
are not going to lose one i will go down to the farm
and sleep there and thompson will take me in with his
milk

  so you have another excuse to hang around the farm
sunday night fred slyly added burroughs by the
way when does thompsons daughter return to mt
holyoke

  shut up retorted scoefield whose face flushed for
a second as the men nudged each other

  it is a pity to spoil freds vacation he needs it quite
as much as we middle-aged men observed dr mueller

breakfast over the members scattered each to
his hobby while professor kenworthy sauntered
down the path to the dirt road which he scrutinized care-
fully for some distance each way the tracks of the
motorcycle were clearly discernible in the heavy clay
the place where the rider had stopped and numerous
cigarette butts indicating a stay of some duration noth-
ing beyond that was discoverable except the motorcycle
had not returned but continued on the road this fact
puzzled the professor as he meandered down to thomp-
sons farm he found the old farmer in the barn pitch-
ing hay as it lacked but a few minutes of noon thomp-
son carefully laid aside his fork when he saw ken-
worthy and coming out of the barn he invited him into
the spring house to have a glass of buttermilk

  as they chatted the professor related the facts of the
strange disappearance of the chrysalis and made in-
quiry about the length and outlet of the road it ap-
peared that the road ran by a devious route deep into the
hill country for about  miles and then cut across a
concrete state highway leading directly south to rutland
this was an important clue and would have to be run
out while the tracks of the thief were still fresh no
time could be lost as the sky was clouding up and a
slight shower would destroy the trail as kenworthy
hurried up to the clubhouse thompson hitched his best
driving horse to a light buggy

  these details were related to the men and after a
hasty lunch scoefield hurried down the hillside to the
farm ken worthy watched him down in the valley ap-
proaching the house and noted a figure in white sweater
and knickers get into the buggy beside him

  well freds detective work wont be very accurate
or thorough under the circumstances he dryly ob-
served to mueller who stood beside him on the porch

  dont fool yourself kenny retorted the doctor
miss thompson is majoring in biology at college and
will probably be keenly interested

  kenworthy sighed at any rate they will enjoy
the full moon tonight

  fred did not disappoint the men for when he returned
that evening he reported that he had followed the trail
the stolen chrysalis



all the way to state road where the tracks turned
sharply to the left indicating that the motorcyclist had
headed for rutland where the thief would have the
choice of frequent trains going south

  monday morning found fred back in new york
sleepy and tired after a five-hour trip in spite of dozing
most of the way fortunately he picked a taxi driver
who entered into the spirit of the chase for he was lit-
erally raced from publisher to publisher his fame
which both bored and embarrassed him proved the open
sesame to the editorial rooms he was surprised at the
wide circle of acquaintances these editors had they
really seemed to know everybody who typed a line in
the metropolis he was swamped with names but kind
assistance narrowed down the list to a possible dozen

  there was nothing else to do but call on these men in-
dividually then the wild goose chase began it was
most discouraging several of the writers were out of
town other were out digging up copy or had dinner
engagements the afternoon appeared to be wasted
since only four men had been actually interviewed

  hot and exhausted fred returned to his office to
change his wilted collar and freshen up a bit before go-
ing to the engineers club for dinner he would rest an
hour or so and pursue the trail again in the evening

  it was after   when he walked into his office he
was not surprised to see the door ajar for he knew the
cleaners would be at work at this time but it was quite a
shock to see a man on his knees rummaging through the
waste baskets letter by letter

  what are you doing here he demanded the man
started up at the sound of his voice as if shocked by
electricity

  why boss fm collectin post marks and stamps for
a fellow hes a bug on stamps and he pays me to go
through the baskets

  well thats curious i do that myself by the way
wrhat are you specially looking for now

  oh he is trying to get the post marks of every town
in new england i am working on vermont now

  is that so well i dont get many letters from that
state let me see oh yes yes there is one it comes in
a blue envelope from oakdale did you notice that
one

  yes i got that one about three weeks ago

  fred backed against the door his eyes flashing in
anger

  you are a damn liar and spy for some reporter he
shouted as he dropped off his coat and deliberately rolled
up his sleeves

  the mans face blanched as he stared dumbly at scoe-
field after a moment he replied say boss us jani-
tors is entitled to salvage out of the baskets aint we

  now look here man i know you have your living
to earn and you try to turn a penny wherever you can
but the fact remains that you are working for a crook
i am going to ask the building superintendent to transfer
you to another floor never enter my office again and
you are not getting out now-until you give me the name
and address of the fellow you sent that letter to if you
dont tell me the truth you will be out of a job to-
morrow

  the janitor measured with his eye the youth and
physical perfection of scoefields six feet of manhood he
had been caught like a rat in a trap and after all it had
not paid very well might as well make a clean breast of

it anything to save his job he hesitated for a mo-
ment and then reaching in his pocket he produced a
large stamped and addressed envelope which with trem-
bling hand he handed to scoefield without another
word he stooped and gathered the loose letters into a
burlap bag then taking up his dust-pan and brush he
trudged out of the office and down the hall

  fred studied the address

            michael j hawk

            no - third ave

  a great piece of luck he mused as he searched in
vain through his list probably an assumed name but
if professor ken worthys deductions are correct you
are surely the man mr hawk and since you live in one
of the toughest sections of the city i think it would be
wiser to call on you in daylight

early next morning fred phoned to the taxi
driver he had employed on monday and briefly ex-
plained the mission they threaded their way across
town amid the chaos of the morning rush hour and
shortly found themselves before a dingy walk-up apart-
ment house the driver insisted upon accompanying
fred and stood in the hall while he interviewed mr
hawk

  a sallow-faced individual of about forty with sleepy
eyes and wearing a bathrobe and slippers ushered scoe-
field into the literary workshop of a typical hack-writer
what a room to describe with its shelving thousands of
books old magazines and newspapers against the far
wall which was pierced by a double window extended
a long work-table burdened with a great confusion of
writing materials typewriter fieldglasses radio camera
and a microscope under a glass dome

  scoefield took in the room and the man in a swift
comprehensive glance

  mr hawk i believe writer for daily science the
chicago quarterly of natural science the robot inter-
national the philadelphia sunday transcript

  you flatter me dear sir pray to whom do i owe
the honor of this early morning visit

  scoefield is my name i am a member of the vermont
astronomical society

  please be seated and have a cigarette mr hawk
suavely enjoined

  thanks but i havent time to pay a social call the
facts are these

  on friday night a fossil chrysalis was stolen from
our club-house it was one of a number of fossils
brought back from the recent lunar expedition

  oh so i have the pleasure of meeting frederick
scoefield the second lindbergh the inventor of the
moon strollers etc etc indeed mr scoefield you are
such an elusive person to interview what can i possibly
do for you in exchange for the chance to get an ex-
clusive story 

  as i said before a fossil chrysalis was stolen and
after careful investigation by a noted criminologist the
trail leads directly to your rooms as the repository of
that article please dont register amazement and in-
dignation  i am not going to argue with you i admire
the trouble and expense you have gone to to commit a
worthless theft now understand this clearly if you
dont come across immediately we will have to tempor-
arily suspend your animation for the present while
these rooms are searched oh dont think i came here


amazing stories

without a search warrant and without the proper
authority give me that chrysalis even if it is hatching
you could use it as news it would be just one straw too
heavy on the publics back of credulity

  hawk looked at fred with narrow shrewd eyes as he
thought rapidly mr scoefield you astonish me with
your statements what i need is a good story news
is very scarce at present since the public is fed up on that
trip to the moon business what would it be worth to
you if i said i knew the location of your quest

  look here man give me that chrysalis at once and
if you ever prowl around the clubhouse again it will
probably be at the peril of two barrels of buckshot and
please let the astronomical club alone if you need
another lunar story why dont you hang around the
boston philological society  they have about completed
the translation of the basalt discs that will be officially
published in some dry journal of philology of course
but a popular write-up with several clever drawings
would take well in the magazines 

  mr scoefield he replied i must say you are a
scholar and a gentleman i will surrender the chrysalis
and apologize for the trouble i have put you to al-
though i have no regrets-i have secured both a story
and a pleasant interview please make one prediction
about the basalt discs

  scoefield looked indignantly at hawk but decided to
humor him

  when the inscriptions are published there will be
another expedition and another story

  hawks bedroom window faced the south and fred
followed closely after him as he went to the window
and took the precious chrysalis from a gauze bag which
was pinned to the top rail of the lower sash

  for full five minutes in the warm yellow sunlight
scoefield examined the chrysalis a strange metamor-
phosis had taken place within the past two days the
color had changed and the pupa casing seemed so brittle
it might burst at any moment mr hawk looked covet-
ously at the thing as fred placed it within a fold of
cotton in a small metal box and left the room abruptly

  the chrysalis was going to hatch and shortly too
that was certain how to get back to vermont quickly

  the aviation field at once fast as you can he
cried to the taxi man as they hustled down the stairs
thirty minutes more and he was at long island field

  i must have an airplane to take me to thompsons
farm at oakdale vermont at once he demanded

  we are very sorry mr scoefield but there is not
even an emergency landing field within  miles of oak-
dale replied the traffic manager

  that means nothing to me ill drop by parachute
i will sign a statement assuming all risk

two hours later a trimotored plane reconnoitered
over the thompson farm fred remained calmly
seated while the aviator pulled a lever and dropped him
through the emergency trap a tiny white puff ball ap-
peared behind the plane then a second later the pilot
parachute had pulled out the big silk enevlope which
spread like a giant mushroom dangling and swaying in
the gusty mountain air fred dropped safely to earth
with his precious cargo strapped on his chest in the metal
box willing hands untangled the cordage and literally
carried him to the shack it was not a moment too soon

the

 for the chrysalis had split down the thorax and the pupa
 within was in a state of convulsive motion

   it wont be long now observed skidmore as he
placed the chrysalis in its loop of silken thread which
held it in an upright position on the ancient twig there
is nothing in nature quite so marvelous as to see the em-
ergence of the butterfly from its chrysalis

   the men sat spell-bound around the table as little by
 little the head then the thorax and lastly the abdomen
 struggled free from the pupa case the wings folded
 like an umbrella around the body slowly spread out as
 the blood could be seen swelling the thick marginal veins
 a beautiful thing jet black and with a wing span of at
 least  inches it had six legs the frontal pair being atro-
 phied and hugged close to the body the entire wings
 and body were covered with long black hairs causing it
 to resemble the vanessa antiopa-a hibernating species
 of north america on the under side of the frontal
 wings were two white scent pouches corresponding to
 those carried by the male monarch as the marvelous
 creature slowly waved its wings it fanned out a heavy
 perfume both nauseating and overpowering in its odor

   close all windows and stop smoking boys com-
manded skidmore we dont know how quickly this
thing will be ready for flight i for one think it should
be put immediately in the cyanide jar

   just a few more minutes skidmore spoke out dr
 mueller we should study its reactions to various ex-
 ternal stimuli to discover what vestiges of instinct or
 intelligence remain to this the moons last living crea-
 ture

   the head with huge single lensed eyes turned on an
 axis from side to side as it looked around the table
 with a doleful and apprehensive stare it turned on its
 perch seeming to regard the men one by one evidently
 its eyes were long focused for it followed every move
 of skidmore as he quietly placed the glass bell of cyanide
 on the table its wings now fluttered spasmodically as
 wave on wave of nerve-deadening perfume stupefied
 the senses nerve centers were paralyzed as the men
 breathed the heavy air laden by some subtle narcotic in
 spite of his strong will and mental alertness skidmores
 senses reeled he managed to clutch the table and break
 his fall as he dropped heavily to the floor dr mueller
 lost consciousness with his eyes staring wide open pro-
 fessor kenworthy slid off his chair with a thud

   with dish towel in hand peters the colored cook
 rushed into the room after the second shock the men
 unconscious-the giant butterfly on the wing-the heavy
 air he could not comprehend so he frantically raised the
 windows and then batted savagely at the thing with his
 towel hardly a second passed before it sensed the
 draught and gracefully darted out the window

   the cool air revived the men within a few moments
 they staggered to their feet dumfounded skidmore
 was first to break the silence

   it is gone boys i should have acted more quickly
 besides i should have warned peters oh why did he let
 the thing get away 

   have no regrets skidmore muttered dr mueller
 just listen to him singing in the kitchen oblivious of
 our great loss after all the question will always arise
 -if he had not opened the windows in the nick of time
 would we probably not have all been dead

amazing stories



in the realm of books

facts about the ants

the astonishing ant by julie closson
  kenly illustrated by henry c kenly
  published by d appleton  company
  nezv york london price 

we take special interest in reviewing
this very attractive book the readers
of amazing stories have had a
number of stories about ants presented to
them in our pages some of these stories
must have appeared rather remarkable or
even extravagant as predicating such
power and intelligence for these little be-
ings in this book there is no science fic-
tion but scientific truth a detailed account
of the insect whom the author terms
astonishing it makes the ant appear
more wonderful than it has been depicted
in our pages a clue to the work may be
obtained from the titles from a few of the
chapters such as seeing antland ant
weddings ant housekeeping the
ant underworld mushroom growing
ants and we even have a chapter on the
termites whose popular name is white
ants

  it can well be seen that twenty chapters
such as these will cover an immense amount
of ground the most wonderful stories
are told about these insects whose ways
seem almost human  interesting as the
subject is to the distinguished authoress
she says there is something sad about it
since the department of agriculture in
washington announces that ants destroy
millions and millions of dollars worth of
property in the united states alone to

mostly scientific fiction

say nothing of the combined losses

  in the tropics ants are still worse than
in our country one curious thing told
us is that there are some  kinds of
termites white ants

  despite the fact that the book seems
to be written for children we can hardly
say too much in its favor for perusal by
grown people it has between two and
three hundred pages of most interesting
text and in the neighborhood of forty very
wonderful illustrations by henry c kenly
besides these there are numerous little tail
pieces every one of special interest
author and artist have certainly distin-
guished themselves in this book and after
you have read it you will come to the con-
clusion that the stories about ants which
we have given are not all exaggerated ex-
cept of course in the obvious necessity of
making a good story

  another thing  we were glad to see
a reference to thoreaus description of
the battle of the ants which he saw when
he was living at walden pond in his her-
mitage

  the destructive powers of the termites
and their concealed activities are very curi-
ous they will reduce the wood of a piece
of furniture to dust without disturbing the
outside so that a chair intact to all appear-
ance will crumble if one sits upon it they
build clay nests twenty feet high it is
in africa that these great structures attain
what may be termed the perfection of size

  the book would be specially good read-
ing after some of our stories in this maga-
zine-t oc s

again-mr fort
lo by charles fort published by
claude kendall new york 

in spite of very flattering comments by
such shining literati as theodore
dreiser and booth tarkington i can
only say that i neither share their views
not their enthusiasm mr fort is apparently
presenting an outstanding collection of rec-
ords of unusual happenings and unexplained
phenomena going as far back as  in
this book as well as in his book of the
damned there is an oft-occurring refer-
ence to mysterious rainfalls causing the
appearance of frogs fishes worms etc
the generally accepted explanations have
never satisfied mr fort so he must attack
any and all explanations of any and all
phenomena as totally incorrect and absurd

 he is an expert mountain maker given
tiniest mole-hill he will make the hima-
layas hang their heads in shame his
views on astronomy are somewhat peculiar
and astounding the stars are about a
weeks travel away to him the earth is
pancake-shaped and it seems to rile him
that scientific bodies do not welcome im-
proved theories or explanations with wide
open arms

 quien sabe as our spanish friends
have it i am convinced that mr fort
would vigorously deny that two times two
make four and that any unquestionable
scientific proof for this small piece of
arithmetic should be held incorrect

 lo amused me very much-c a

editor amazing stories

  i enjoy very much your stories and even more
the discussions

  i think the scientific truth to be extracted from
your stories is over-estimated-the greatest asset
in science is the desire to know more than they
implant thereby causing many readers to com-
mence a deeper study

  many of your stories are too amazing among
these i place the skylark three and the
black star passes the moving of a planet in
black star passes is impossible as deviation
from its orbit would cause its destruction the
skylark three is too full of almost impossible
possibility and too full of destruction

  the fourth-dimensional space penetrator
which found so little favor with many of your
readers i considered excellent ruling out the pene-
trator which was impossible the theme was well
thought out and the possibility of life on an elec-
tron has a scientific possibility and what en-
hanced it there was no fighting but cooperation be-
tween scientists

  as we trace humanity from the dim recesses
of the past we find that from a one time when
man delighted in slaughter picturing himself even
in heaven valhalla drinking out of the skulls
of his foes he has progressed til now he sees war

in its true aspect a horror we are seeking by all
means to abolish

  therefore is it not possible that the future on
earth will find world peace also that should the
secret of space travel be found and intelligence
further advanced than ourselves be found is it
not probable that they will conform to the same
evolutionary law and be peace loving races

  you may reply that you must have action may
i suggest that such action be found in planets like
venus the younger worlds where the mon-
strosities that found places on our world in the
pre-glacier age live and what a field for romance
the moon holds of a dying race in the ages past
fighting an unsuccessful fight against nature while
in their sight but just beyond reach a larger
world our earth just beginning a life supporting
era what desires what titanic efforts must have
taken place on the now scarred face of the moon
before final finis was written all too plain

  lastly as a canadian may i state the stories
dealing with world affairs are too american u
s  particularly a scientifiction paper like
amazing stories we canadians admire the
untiring energy and many excellent qualities in
fact we humbly claim to be very much like you

  we know however that scientific and also social
achievement is world wide the contributions to
world achievement vary with the characteristics of
the race britain gave exploration and develop-
ment and a fine literature germany- music
france medical science america is giving a

social and mechanical advancement previously
unknown above all men like einstein edding-
ton crookes millikan and jeans are international
so please let it be understood that as today science
is world wide so too in the future will it de-
pend on the contributions of men independent of
race or creed as with science so with courage
honor and love of truth

  i notice in december issue a new zealander
brings up the subject but he implies that strengths
of present day armies and navies are the important
factors we canadians think differently we with
no army or navy who can boast less wars than
any country we who have never been guilty of
aggression or an aggressive spirit believe that the
important factor is the contribution each country
gives to the sum of world knowledge

  if our magazine and five others were to
take up a line of independent study it will have
done very good work our stories have had a
strong fictional element and there is only room
for enough science to inspire the reader with de-
sire for further instruction we are very glad to
get a criticism from winnipeg which has become
a true metropolis of the north west the writer
has very pleasant recollections of a visit he paid
there some years ago world achievement is cer-
tainly world wide the improvements even of

an alleged recurrent plea

which we find does not do
much recurring the un-
derlying topic of the
name amazing stories

editor amazing stories

  that ever re-current plea which usually pops
up several times in every issue of amazing
stories-the request to change the title to scien-
tifiction is both the subject and object of this
letter

  it may interest you to know that as an engineer
of the transient variety and consequently con-
stantly in contact with others of this profession i
have come to the conclusion that a very large pro-
portion of your readers are engineers possibly
this is unknown to you for it is read as a relaxa-
tion due to the natural limitations of their life-
work and also to their inherent progressiveness
neither of which are conducive to correspondence

  amazing stories while a title which is ad-
mittedly attention-holding does not indicate or
suggest the actual contents of the magazine it
is misleading and while it may attract a few
temporary readers each month they are lost as
readily for the contents are not what the title
implied i would venture to say that nine out of
ten of your regular readers accidentally hap-
pened on one of your issues as i did and in
casually perusing it discovered a type of fiction
they had long sought this is true with one
hundred per cent of your readers whom i know

  i wont tell you of the struggles that rage within
me each month as i approach the newsstand for
my copy of the magazine i blush to the ears as
i ask for amazing stories not because i am
ashamed of the contents but for the misleading
title and cover for the same reason i object to
reading it in trains or anywhere in public

  in your answer to one letter in the january
issue you state that scientifiction is a coined
word and consequently poor english im sur-
prised-and i still would be surprised if i had
read it in the atlantic monthly my dear sir
-all new words are coined-you will find hun-
dreds in the dictionary as a result of the great
war i believe radio is coined but why
go into detail

  why not try an experiment in one issue
inform your readers that the title will be
changed in the following issue to scientifiction
put it in a nice conservative jacket and get the
results and if my prediction of a large increase
is not forthcoming switch back to the old

  your regular readers are surely of the type that
would welcome a little experimentation you if
consistent should

   the result should be mutually beneficial

  amazing stories has gone under that name
for so many years that we hardly feel it would
be good policy to change its name especially when
the magazine is doing well the title rs an old
one and entitled to respect for that reason the
covers are done with the greatest thought and
care and have won encomiums as well as intelli-
gent criticism from many of our readers as you
will find by looking over the discussions col-
umns in regard to coining of new words any-
one who looks at websters unabridged diction-
ary will feel that we should go very slowly in in-
troducing new words into the english language
experimenting with a popular magazine is a
dangerous pastime but we hope that you realize
that we particularly welcome such letters as yours
where a correspondent shows himself a good
thinker and you certainly do that-editor

editor amazing stories

  using the menace from andromeda april
 as an opening i hereby dive in that open-
ing to pen and paw you

  i understood from the story the heros dis-
covery of alcoreth in the nebula of an-
dromeda took place when alcoreth was in
the throes of an organic upheaval andromeda
being nearly a million light years from us-ergo
-the view that he the hero got on his photo-
graphic plate took place nearly a million light
years ago and traveling at the speed of light
the protoplasmic emanations would strip the
world of over nearly a million light years in
the future from the time he saw the scene to
make myself plainer it would take nearly a
million light years for an article dispatched
from alcoreth to reach us yet it obligingly
for the story took just over a year all of
which proves that this story ended nearly a
million light years too soon our minds
though of course have to be elastic enough to-
stretch from here to alcoreth without snapping
under the strain this being made possible by the
fact that we will read these stories

   i am by nature a critic an amateur critic of
a low rating the small mean kind that take a
keen delight in finding fault mentally with
everything that comes their way i look forward
to your publications every month fume when
it has not arrived at the newsstand etc read it
enjoy it revere your editorial sneer at the letter
writers at the end of the book blush when i see
the bizarre pictures on the cover tear them off
so that nobody will see what i am reading gloat
in the fact that never yet have i found an illus-
tration that actually coincides with the story
along with the drawing being architecturally and
mechanically perfect and smile arrogantly when
i find a glaring simple mathematical or mechan-
ical mistake but however that is my own pecu-
liar wray of living and enjoying life and for the
four years i have been reading your magazine
never yet have i regretted buying a copy your
bad stories show up your good ones and vice-
versa some of the stories that you offer to the
public are analogous with presenting einstein
with a dime novel and also with casting straw-
berries before donkeys but ill take all that
you offer and promise you never again will i
hold correspondence with your office unless i
come across a  a-l illustration

   your very amusing letter suggests to an im-
partial observer that your peculiar way of liv-
ing and enjoying life is hardly the right one
for it does not seem a correct view of life to find
your pleasure in detecting the weakness of other
people you speak of sneering at the letter
writers at the end of the book personally we
consider the discussions column very inter-
esting reading and many readers turn to that the
minute they get the magazine your tearing off
the covers is a very poor practice you have no
idea of the amount of thought given to them and
they are all drawn by excellent artists your
dohig this indicates sensitiveness on your part
and sensitiveness is a quality which may make
life rather miserable do you know that there
have been many critics who quite admire dime
novels and that one of einsteins recreations is
the very simple one of sailing about in a little
boat but dont let us lose you as a corre-
spondent for we thoroughly enjoyed the spice in
your letter-editor

a high tribute to mr verrill
apropos of his story about
the blood corpuscle

editor amazing stories

   although i have been reading amazing stories
for two years this is my first letter to the dis-
cussions columns i have just finished reading
the february issue my reason for writing this
letter is to congratulate you and mr verrill on
his story the exterminator to my way of
thinking it is wonderful

   being a premedical student at the university
of maine i have had some laboratory work on
the human blood after reading about one third
of the story i came to the conclusion that the
exterminator was a white blood corpuscle
which surmise turned out to be true

   mr verrills way of describing the life of the
exterminator was very interesting he fol-
lowed the creature through the blood stream
seemingly reading its mind he described its
life when the patient was in good health and
july 

amazing stories



when he was siek mr verrills description of
the corpuscles thoughts was marvelous it
seemed to me that i was with the creature when
the vessel was broken

  the only thing in the-story that puzzled me
was the name of the disease that the patient had
when the blood was drawn for the slide i would
like to know what it was

  there is in my opinion only one fault with
your pardon me our magazine and that is
it contains too many stories about the same things
why not publish some stories about surgery
also i would like to see more stories by miles
breuer dr keller mr verrill and captain
meek

orono maine

  we have before now said that mr verrill
was a well-known author he has written a
quantity of matter much of it serious on
archeology ethnology and similar topics much
on topics interesting to young people and part of
it fiction some of the fiction was for the young
and that is conceded to be the most difficult of
all fictional writing we certainly have had
stories about surgery telling of almost miracles
which were supposed to have been done by the
operators as one of the very last we would
cite dr kellers story the ambidexter which
is very distinctly surgical that tells of a horrible
surgical event perpetrated by an oriental on an
occidental we are sure you will see many more
stories by the four favorite authors whom you
name in conclusion-editor

a vivid letter from a founteen-
year-old correspondent

editor amazing stories

  saaay whats happened in the last four or five
months to make good old amazing stories so
swell i never dreamed a magazine could be so
good why-do you know in the last few issues
there wasnt one story which i didnt consider
excellent if they continue to get any better im
afraid you will in a short while exceed all limits
of improvement

  here is my way of rating the stories in the
january number-excellent the prince of
space tanks under the sea the black
hand via the time accelerator the drums
of tapajos the act of retipuj

  now for the covers of late they have been ex-
cellent all except the november and january
issues reason i do not think they were well
chosen why oh whyl mr editor dont you pen
those nightmarish monsters up inside the maga-
zine speaking of the covers and those night-
marish monsters reminds me of the experience i
had with one the other night

  it was about midnight and i was thirsty so
in view of the latter fact i switched on the light
and started to climb out of bed as i did so my
glance happened to rest on the cover of the no-
vember a s you know that one where the
globoid terror is about to settle the hash of
his three victims well sir being as i was only
half-awake it startled me so that i let out a yelp
and fell to the floor flat on my face with all my
bed-clothes on top of me before going back to bed
i put the magazine at the bottom of a pile of
others

  before closing the cover discussions i wish to
ask a question what was the round red and yel-
low thing on the january cover for

  it may interest you to know that i have gained
for you exactly nine new readers three of whom
are teachers

although amazing stories conveys almost
everything i can wish for i will never forgive

you for letting -- get the snake mother

yes ive read it and boy is it swell but i
would have rather have seen it in a s

  p s what is your advice to an amateur
author 

  p p s i am a mere boy of  years

  this letter comes from a member of the boys
scientifiction club as the reader will see he is
only fourteen years old we are very glad to
have teachers for our readers we doubt very
much if the picture of the globoid terror alone
frightened you you would be surprised if you
knew the amount of thought and criticism that
is devoted to our covers we want them to please
the serious reader but we want them also to at-
tract the attention of those who do not know the
magazine so these different considerations operate
to make them somewhat unconventional and per-
haps if we could make them still more unconven-

tional it would be good for our circulation our
advice to an amateur author which you ask for
would be to unhesitatingly try his hand at some
writing for if he fails to place it it will be the
best kind of practice but the life of a free-lance
writer is a habitual disappointment the january
cover showed the sun seen from mars-editor

a tribute to captain meek dr

breuers on the martian
liner endocrinology
in a story

editor amazing stories

  i have just finished the march issue of amaz-
ing stories and felt that i should write you as
to the reaction that occurred

  this issue was a fairly good one but the story
that took first place in my mind was the
earths cancer by capt s p meek i sup-
pose the only reason i liked this story was be-
cause the research on cancer is my favorite hobby
or if it is not a hobby it is a great enjoyment
capt meek has always written good stories and
this one appealed to me greatly the story on
the martian liner was a pure disappointment
to me i am not trying to say that the story
should be placed in the scrap basket but for it to
be written by dr miles j breuer-

  the thing that walked in the rain was a
fair story as they go but if little more endocri-
nology was added it might have increased the
benefits of the explanation a little more i dont
know a little comment on the valley of
titans-it is true that the name amazing stories
implies that things be extraordinary and fantastic
but those fantastic things should have a half-
wav decent scientific explanation as the maga-
zine is also said to be scientific i am not
referring to the control of the speed of evolu-
tion though that is slightly out of the ordinary
i refer to the misty ones of novad ehasor
about whom i would like an explanation also
how about some good stories on atomic energy

  we are greatly pleased with such letters as
yours which criticize even if unfavorably you
must remember that what pleases one person does
not please another personally we thought
dr breuers story about the travelers to mars
was extremely good it had adventure and sus-
pense and we are confident that our readers as a
whole enjoyed it as we did we admit that the
explanation in the thing that walked in the
rain might have been a little fuller and per-
haps the endocrine ductless gland might have
been added to the comments you are getting
stories about two of the subjects you mention
in the last lines of your letters-editor

a story which is amazing because
impossible evolution the
beneficial effects of the
sun

editor amazing stories

  this is my first letter to our magazine and i
wonder how you will take it

  your stories are it but i would like to see
them a little more amazing the story which
i think is the most amazing is world atavism
it is amazing because it is impossible man did
not descend from a mammal and since his creation
remained to be man and will continue to be so as
long as this world exists this also goes for all
other creatures whatever man does is accom-
plished by evolution is this not true

indeed the sun has many beneficial powers and
if the theory of evolution were true i think
such a thing as world atavism could be possible

  i really enjoyed the story and i hope that
there will be many more stories as good as this
one the february issue you printed on differ-
ent paper which makes the magazine much thin-
ner i was glad to see this as i bind all of
my copies into books

   we will let this letter speak for itself there
are all sorts of views on the subject you allude
to in the s and s of the last century rigid
views on evolution held sway but it is very in-
teresting to see how the points of view have been
changed in the present century by such men as
jeans millikan and others men equally dis-
tinguished having individual ideas about this
world of ours-editor

  for one purpose to produce graduates who
  will be of value to the radio industry if our

  institute never made a pennybut did

  succeed in lifting the standard of radio
  technicians engineers and merchandisers
  we would consider our work a success

    naturally we want our message to reach
  as many men as possible so we founded
  resident schools in four metropolitan cities
  then we opened our courses to men all over
  the world who cannot afford to give up their
  positions thousands of our students study
  at home in their spare time with the equip-
  ment we furnish they have their own radio
  laboratory right at home you too can start
  your course at home any time

    our courses cover the entire radio field
  we train beginners who have had no pre-
  vious knowledge of radio advanced stu-
  dents take our more technical courses but
  whatever branch of radio interests you is
  all ready for you to study the cost is sur-
  prisingly low for the training you get

    as the oldest radio school in america we
  have given training to nearly  men
  many of these are now executives and engi-
  neers in the largest broadcasting and manu-
  facturing companies butnone of these
  arrived overnight nor will you your suc-

an excellent exposition of trav-
eling to the moon the ef-
fect of its low gravity
on a hammer blow

 editor amazing stories

    i am writing concerning one of the stories in
 the february issue the man who annexed the
 moon by bob olsen this was an interesting
 and exciting story but it seemed to me he over-
 stepped the boundaries of present-day fact a little
 too far without giving any adequate reason the
 greatest error was in his method of utilizing the
 orbital velocity of the earth to get to the moon
 granting the premise that it would be possible
 to release the ship from the earths gravitation it
 would be possible to use the orbital velocity of
 the earth to get to the moon but not in the way
 he suggested

    it is a well recognized law in physics that
 when a body is moving in a curved path there
 must be a cetripedal force operating inward along
 the radius of the curvature equal to and opposed
 to the centrifugal force

    thus the analogy which was given of the boy
 towed on skates was false in some details for
 when the boy made the u turn the ice would
 supply the force necessary to turn him computed
 by the above statement if this force were not
 present he could not turn as is easily shown
 when you run on ice without skates and try to
 turn the same difficulty was encountered in
 early aviation attempts before the scheme of
 banking on turns was discovered the rudder
 turned the nose of the ship but the ship con-
 tinued going in its original direction that is
 the orientation of the ship with reference to its
 line of velocity was changed but the line of
 velocity was not

    velocity is a vector quantity expressing direc-
  tion as well as magnitude momentum is mea-
  sured by the product of the mass and velocity
  m x v the statement that the momentum was
  practically the same after they had made their
  u turn is then false for the velocity was in a
  different direction the force necessary to change
  the direction of the velocity would be extremely
  large at any reasonable radius of curvature for at
  the velocity of  mph or  ftsec
  the quantity m v would be tremendous this
  force was in no way accounted for in the story
  but it seemed taken for granted that once the
  nose of the ship was pointed in a given direction
  the velocity would automatically change this
  is a little too much to pass without explanation

    another minor point was left out which how-
 ever would have little effect on this story from
 the point where the earths gravitational force
 was cut off it is not stated whether this also cut
 off the gravitational pull of the sun if it did
 the earth would not then be traveling with the
 ship but the ship would leave at a tangent to
 the earths orbit it is this fact that might be
 used in a flight to the moon for in a short time
 the tangent would intersect the orbit of the moon
 and thus a flight might be accomplished without
 the impossible bending back and change of
 velocity direction

    another inconsistency was the difficulty ex-
 perienced in driving the drill with a hammer on
 the moon true the hammer would have less
 weight on the moon but the most important factor
 in using a hammer is not its weight but its mo-
 mentum at the instant of impact and momen-
 tum in mass which is unaffected by gravitation
 the effectiveness of the hammer would be little
 impaired for the force of gravity is an inconsider-
 able feature as is shown by the fact that it is
 easy to drive a nail into a vertical wall where the
 force of gravity is no assistance whatever

    i like the stories and illustrations as a whole
  although the illustrations are often inaccurate
  for example the cover on the february number
  shows the entire heads of the adventurers with
  their sleekly combed hair while the story dis-
  tinctly says that before putting on the space suit
  they donned a union suit made of wool it had
  a tight-fitting hood which covered the head and
  lower part of face leaving only the eyes and
  nose exposed little errors like this detract
  from the enjoyment of the really good illustra-
  tions

    we find your letter extremely interesting it
  is a good illustration of what we might almost
  call a function of our work-the awakening of
  scientific interest by fiction you have heard of
  hitting the nail on the head it is a proverbial
  expression we can compliment you on your
  success in hitting the drill on the head you
  speak of driving a nail through a vertical wall a
  still more extreme case would be of driving one

 still more against gravity directly up into the
 ceiling we thank you for calling our attention
 to the slighterror on the cover page-editor

an interplanetary monthly

an interesting letter from the antipodes

 editor amazing stories

    i suppose i am slightly premature in my writing
  to you as i have only seen eight of your issues
  of amazing stories but i feel that i must
  write to you and draw your attention to an
  astronomical error which mr nathanson com-
  mitted in his story the passing star septem-
  ber issue  the third question in your
  science questionnaire is what is the distance
  of the nearest star see page  on page
   mr nathanson states that alpha centauri
  ll light years distant is our nearest neighbor
  in the stellar world this is not so several
  years ago a faint star also in the constellation
  of the centaurus proxima centauri was found
  to be three billion miles nearer than alpha i am
  quoting joseph mccabe in his book wonders
  of the stars now that i have chastised you
  i will try to make amends

    amazing stories i think is by far the best
 scientific fiction magazine published and i shall
 proceed to treat the magazine in sections first
 the stories they are all very good with of
 course the exception of one or two i think the
 worst i have read is the act of retipuj the
 best i ever read is skylark three the latter
 story was marvelous and although i am only
 aged twelve i appreciate it fully my favorite
 authors are dr smith dr breuer taylor han-
 sen jack williamson harl vincent captain
 meek and charles cloukey the artists and
 drawings-of all your artists wesso is su-
 preme his drawings are so accurate and life-
 like that it is hard to believe that they are not
 photographs morey and paul are his greatest
 rivals he has nothing to fear from the others
 the discussions are very interesting the theory
 propounded by p g miller that neptune is
 an invader from space is very ingenious and
 should be given serious consideration the edi-
 torials are always very instructive and well
 written i especially liked the one in the sep-
 tember  issue about the atom and the stars
 the paper is all right but there is one thing i
 do not like about amazing stories and that is
 the way its covers are bound they fall off
 very easily and one does not like to disfigure
 such splendid drawings as you have on the
 covers by pasting them on again interplanetary
 and fourth dimension stories are my favorites
 and while i am on the subject how about an
 interplanetary monthly i am sure it would
 be met with approval by readers of amazing
 stories somebody i forget who suggested it
 in discussions

                  victoria australia

    your letter is quite surprising for one of your
  age it seems as if in australia the boy becomes
  father of the man at a very early age if you
  go at it rightly you can paste the cover on
  again when it has come loose without touching
  the front by attaching your paper slip to the in-
  side it is very pleasant to have our cover page
  illustrations appreciated you probably have no
  idea of the amount of thought which is bestowed
  upon them by artists and editors our next
  quarterly is an interplanetary one and is so
  designated on the cover it contains nearly
  twice the matter of a monthly so that it repre-
  sents nearly twice what you are asking for-in
  other words two interplanetary monthlies we
  have done this in answer to numerous requests
  and we will be much interested in seeing how
  the interplanetary quarterly will be received
  the spring quarterly will contain four classic
  interplanetary stories we consider it quite a
  compliment to get a letter from an australian cor-
  respondent we like the young-editor

  i have on hand a copy of the december

  the telepathic pick-up by samuel m

  the educated harpoon by charles s wolfe
-very good

  since that time the discussions what do
you know and editorials have been added
all of which are greatly appreciated by the aver-
age reader of amazing stories

  as you notice i have listed no excellent
stories in the above mentioned issue but wait
until i come to more recent issues

  i make no comment on the serials because i
did not get to finish them

  i now come to the spring edition  issue
of amazing stories quarterly

  the cover is excellent when i saw that it
was a scene from aladra septamas story
dragons of space i could hardly wait until
i got home before i started reading it

  the editorial scientific responsibility by
victor a endersby was very good

  reclaimers of the ice by stanton a co-
blentz was very good the illustrations to it
were very good

  dragons of space by aladra septama was
excellent the best story in the issue in my
estimation aladra septama is your best writer
keep him by all means the illustrations to
dragons of space were excellent

  the flying threat by david h keller
md and the illustrations were very good
david h keller md is one of your very best
writers

  the red ray by dan fabers was good
so was the illustration

  all in all the spring quarterly was very good

  why dont we have some more stories by

h	g wells and some by edgar rice bur-
roughs

  i havent a copy of the winter quarterly of
 but as i remember it tani of ekkis by
aladra septama was the most interesting story
it is ere of the best if not the very best story
i live ever read white lily by john taine
was   but it was not amazing enough the
as-iing enemy was a very good ant story

i	l- rf will publish more insect stories in the
fur re dirigibles of death by a hyatt
yerriz vns too gruesome it was not as good
as ris sries generally are

  tie illustrations by wesso and morey were
vi	especially the cover picture

  the readers viewpoint was too short

  other countries alas have not your type of
writers to be able to inflame its citizens with their
countrys future greatness look at britain for
instance although i have burrowed into li-
braries searched every publishers list i can only
produce one such writer granted he is one of
the greatest scietifiction scribes he is the only
one i speak of h g wells in england it is
even considered mentally abnormal to read future
interplanetary or dimensional stories so although
i have been able to get my copy with difficulty i
shall be able to keep in touch regularly i hope
and enjoy my copy in spite of adverse opinions
i have only known your magazine for a year i
picked up last februarys number at woolworths
but have since been able to read the current
number perhaps some kind reader who may have
a few back numbers to dispose of would communi-
cate with me i may have something in exchange
for them if he wants in the way of books periodi-
cals etc

  so carry on with good work and let us have
some stories like callisto at war the green
girl menace from mars etc the magazine
is really top hole and i havent an adverse criti-
cism for it except that i dont care for stories like
the feathered detective the secret king-
dom etc there is no scientifiction about them

  this months magazine is great the drums of

here there should be no trouble in getting
amazing stories in england for we have several
agents there in london you must be near enough
to the great city to be able to run in now and
then your request for back numbers is in line
with the wants of a number of our readers and
sometimes of our own editorial department and
we hope that this letter will put you in touch with
someone who can supply your wants we get a
good many letters from london it is evident that
our magazine pleases the natives of the british
isles and we are particularly pleased when we
get an appreciation from an english reader be-
cause we always regard the englishman as being
a most severe critic but criticism is a good
thing for editors and you will see that we publish
letters of severe criticism as well as those of
appreciation the severe ones we are glad to
say are not very frequent we sometimes wonder
whether the public realizes that the letters in our
discussions column are bona fide transcriptions
of the letters received we can assure our read-
ers that they are-editor

television hill criticized

editor amazing stories

  i have been reading amazing stories regularly
for a year and on the whole i have enjoyed the
stories therein however i would like to com-
ment on the latest serial story television hill
by george mclociard this story started very
very promising in the february issue and con-
tinued well in the march issue up till the end
and at this point after being carried away by
enthusiasm by the body of the story i was
dashed into the depths of despair by our old
enemy the wrecked machinery just the old
plot about the brainy scientist his great invention
which would change the whole history of the
world and a beautiful daughter only the au-
thor has skillfully camouflaged and redecorated
it then again in answer to vic gilmers letter
you say sex stuff never appears in amazing

new york city n y

  we agree it was too bad to have all that ma-
chinery wrecked when you speak of an old
plot does it not seem clear that with the multi-
tude of short stories that are pouring out of our
magazines here and abroad that the plots must
practically be repeated over and over again in
endlessly varying form there is a theory or a
statement that there are very few jokes and that
the new ones are but rehashes of the old ones
as regards sex stuff as we used the expression
we applied it to the disagreeable and certainly
no disagreeable sex copy has ever appeared in
amazing stories-editor

a request for a sequel to
television hill

editor amazing stories

  as the most ardent reader of our magazine
to my mind i have a special request to make of
its publishers it is simply this please induce
mr george mclociard into creating as soon as
possible a sequel to his most wonderful serial
television hill

  after reading the conclusion  of this truly
remarkable story in the march number my mind
simply refused to allow me to read anything else
for thinking of it this letter gives me some
relief as there is just the remotest possibility of
its bearing results

  to my mind the story wonderful as it was is
incomplete

  i absolutely refuse to believe that the two
scientists cyrus king and bob wentworth were
killed in the airplane crash the reports were
entirely too vague and uncertain they might
easily have faked the crash and escaped to
some remote place inaccessible by the island
peoples projector and started the construction
of a bigger and better machine with which to
sort of even up scores with their enemies

  we are delighted to see that you have enjoyed
television hill it certainly is a very re-
markable story and the strange succession of
events in it and the variety of incidents have a
gradual tapering down as it were from impend-
ing achievement to the wreck that so often affects
human efforts we hope that mr mclociard
will accept your hint-editor
