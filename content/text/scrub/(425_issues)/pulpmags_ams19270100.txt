incredible facts

 by hugo gernsback

we arc living in stirring times to the individual
with imagination it is easy to believe that we arc
really not living through the wonders we see but
rather that we are living in a story book and
that the achievements about us are nothing but imaginations

  who for instance but an imaginative scientifiction writer
would think of making actual use of starlight absurd
yet two swiss scientists dr kolster and dr deesalis who
have been living in a tent for the last few months on the
summit of monch mountain at an altitude of  feet
have found that a certain group of stars sends out extra-
ordinary rays of light whose radio-activc force is far
stronger than that of x-rays the scientists hope to capture
and employ these rays for scientific and medical purposes

  then john vandcrcock writing in the new york herald-
tribune reports on his recent scientific investigations in
dutch guiana that he found a certain tribe of indians that
use the so-called snake cut well-known and accepted as
the common truth by all dutch scientists just listen to
this fantastic and incrcdible piece of ncar-fiction which is
fact nevertheless the witch-doctors take the head and tail
of a rattlesnake the most deadly one imaginable they then
cook this together with some herbs and under a full moon
make it into a dark powder now comes the astonishing
tiling they take a man and make an incision in his veins
and into this incision pour the powder from that time on
the man so treated has the power of paralyzing a snake
when he encounters a snake no matter how deadly it may
be it becomes completely powerless at his approach

  scientists in analyzing the medicine have come within
 per cent of finding the ingredients but the rest is mystery
they believe that the powder causes a certain exhalation
in the perspiration of the person so treated which has the
power of paralyzing the snake but this is simply a theory

  then science comes along and finds the dcnsest star we
know of-a small satellite of the star sirius it is a star
of about the same size as our earth but weighs almost as
much as our sun that of course means nothing to the
imagination but translated it means that if we should col-
lect from this star a little of its material the size of a base-
ball the little ball would actually weigh over  tons or ap-
proximately one ton per cubic inch thats nothing however

  scientists now have a substance called neutronium
which we know exists in nature this material weighs 
million tons per cubic inch  it would take some  wool-
worth buildings if placed in a scale to balancc one cubic
inch of neutronium neutronium is four trillion times as
dense as water it is composed of an electron and a proton
when the two coalesce with cach other it is the most in-

  mr hugo gemsback speaks every monday at  p m

 credible thing in the whole world it is not affected chemi-
 cally it can not be seen or felt and there are no means
 of getting at it this is of course on account of its ex-
 tremely small size so minute that if it falls it will pass
 through every material on its way it readily goes through
 glass walls metal buildings the earth itself and continues
 falling right through the earth passing through the center
 of it and going towards the other side only to fall back
 it keeps up this pendulum-like motion its speed decreasing
 cach time until finally due to friction it locates at the
 center of the earth where it comes to a stop

   then there is the old mystery of kaspar hauser who
 died in germany in  under circumstances as mysterious
 as his real identity his case attracted such remarkable
 interest that in germany alone more than  books have
 been written on the subject

    the story in brief is that one evening in  a nurem-
 berg shoemaker noticed in the street a youth of about sixteen
 years whose dazed appcarance and peculiarity of gait re-
 sembled that of an infant just learning to walk the shoe-
 maker took him to the local barracks offered food the
 boy refused meat and beer with disgust but eagerly ate
 and drank large quantities of bread and water kaspar
 hauser was able to write his name but he babbled like a
 baby he could see very well in the dark while bright
 light caused him acute discomfort giving rise to inflam-
 mation of his eyelids he was a metalopliobc and was so
 intensely affected by metals that he had to have wooden
 spoons and forks with which to eat the boys sense of
 smell was as acute as his sight he fainted at the scent of
 a rose while the smell of meat made him violently sick
 an attempt to give him anything to eat beyond bread and
 water made him ill even a few drops of wine or coffee
 mixed in a glass of water caused violent nausea

    after a while he became educated enough to relate his story
 and it seems that he always lived in a black low-ccilinged room
 in which he was unable to stand upright a black or dark
 man brought him bread and water every day and he had a
 little wooden horse to play with the dark man taught
 him to write until he finally took him into a street where
 the boy was abandoned he lost his sensitivity to light and
 metals after a while but the mystery surrounding him
 would not end for two attacks were made on his life the
 first attempt miscarried but when he was stabbed in a public
 garden of the town for the second time he died three days
 later

   i have given these examples of incredible facts simply to
 show that we should not be too ready to denounce the ideas
 that seem most impossible for they have a trick of material-
 izing even while we are talking about them

 from wrny on various scientific and radio subjects
 sequel to the mad planet
the red dust



chapter i
prey

he sky grew gray and then almost
white the over-hanging banks of
clouds seemed to withdraw a little from
the steaming earth haze that hung
always among the mushroom forests
and above the fungus hills grew more tenuous and
the slow and misty rain that dripped the whole
night long ceased reluctantly

  as far as the eye could see a mad world stretched
out a world of insensate cruelties and strange
fierce maternal solicitudes the insects of the
night-the great moths whose wings spread far
and wide in the dimness and the huge fireflies four
feet in length whose beacons made the earth glow
in their pale weird light-the insects of the night
had sought their hiding-places

  now the creatures of the day ventured forth
a great ant-hill towered a hundred feet in the air
upon its gravel and boulder-strewn side a commo-
tion became visible

  the earth crumbled and fell into an invisible
opening then a dark chasm appeared and two slen-
der threadlike antennae peered out

  a warrior ant emerged and stood for an instant
in the daylight looking all about for signs of danger
to the ant-city he was all of ten inches long this
ant and his mandibles were fierce and strong a
second and third warrior came from the inside of
the ant-hill and ran with tiny clickings about the
hillock waving their antennae restlessly searching
ever searching for a menace to their city

  they returned to the gateway from which they
had made their appearance evidently bearing re-
assuring messages because shortly after they had
reentered the gateway of the ant-city a flood of
black ill-smelling workers poured out of the open-
ing and dispersed upon
their business the click-
ings of their limbs and an
occasional whining strid-
ulation made an inces-
sant sound as they scat-
tered over the earth
foraging among the mush-
rooms and giant cabbages
among the rubbish-heaps
of the gigantic beehives
and wasp colonies and
among the remains of the
tragedies of the night for food for their city

  the city of the ants had begun its daily toil toil
in which every one shared without supervision or
coercion deep in the recesses of the pyramid gal-
leries were hollowed out and winding passages that
led down a fathomless distance into the earth
below

  somewhere in the maze of tunnels there was a
royal apartment in which the queen-ant reposed
waited upon by assiduous courtiers fed by royal
stewards and combed and rubbed by the hands of
her subjects and children

  but even the huge monarch of the city had her
constant and pressing duty of maternity a dozen
times the size of her largest loyal servant she was

no less bound by the unwritten but imperative laws
of the city than they from the time of waking to
the time of rest she was ordained to be the queen-
mother in the strictest and most literal sense of the
word for at intervals to be measured only in terms
of minutes she brought forth a single egg perhaps
three inches in length which was instantly seized
by one of her eager attendants and carried in haste
to the municipal nursery

  there it was placed in a tiny cell a foot or more
in length until a sac-shaped grub appeared all soft
white body save for a tiny mouth then the nurses
took it in charge and fed it with curious tender
gestures until it had waxed large and fat and slept
the sleep of metamorphosis when it emerged from
its rudimentary cocoon it took the places of its
nurses until its soft skin had hardened into the
horny armor of the workers and soldiers and then
it joined the throng of workers that poured out from
the city at dawn to forage for food to bring back
its finds and to share with the warriors and the
nurses the drone males and the young queens and
all the other members of its communities their
duties in the city itself that was the life of the
social insect absolute devotion to the cause of its
city utter abnegation of self-interest for the sake
of its fellows-and death at their hands when their
usefulness was past they neither knew nor ex-
pected more or less

  it is a strange instinct that prompts these crea-
tures to devote their lives to their city taking no
smallest thought for their individual good without
even the call of maternity or sex to guide them
only the queen knows motherhood the others
know nothing but toil for purposes they do not un-
derstand and to an end of which they cannot dream

  at intervals all over the world of burls time
these ant-cities rose above the surrounding ground
some small and barely begun and others ancient
colonies which were truly
the continuation of cities
first built when the ants
were insects to be crushed
beneath the feet of men
these ancient strongholds
towered two three and
even four hundred feet
above the plains and
their inhabitants would
have had to be numbered
in millions if not bil-
lions

  not all the earth was subject to the ants however
bees and wasps and more deadly creatures crawled
over and flew above its surface the bees were four
feet and more in length and slender-waisted wasps
darted here and there preying upon the colossal
crickets that sang deep bass music to their mates-
and the length of the crickets was the length of a
man and more

  spiders with bloated bellies waited motionless in
their snares whose threads were the size of small
cables waiting for some luckless giant insect to be
entangled in the gummy traps and butterflies flut-
tered over the festering plains of this new world
tremendous creatures whose wings could only be
measured in terms of yards

 you who have read the mad planet by murray
 leinster will welcome the sequel to that story the
 world in a jar distant future is peopled with huge insects
 and titanic fungus growths life has been greatly altered
 and tiny man is now in the process of becoming acclimated
 to the change ive again meet our hero burl but this time
 a far greater danger menaces the human race the huge
 insects are still in evidence but the terror they inspire is as
 nothing compared to the deadly red dust you will follow
 this remarkable story with breathless interest


amazing stories

  an outcropping of rock jutted up abruptly from a
fungus-covered plain shelf-fungi and strangely
colored molds stained the stone until the shining
quartz was hidden almost completely from view but
the whole glistened like tinted crystal from the dank
wetness of the night little wisps of vapor curled
away from the slopes as the moisture was taken up
by the already moisture-laden air

  seen from a distance the outcropping of rock
looked innocent and still but a nearer view showed
many things

  here a hunting wasp had come upon a gray worm
and was methodically inserting its sting into each
of the twelve segments of the faintly writhing crea-
ture presently the worm would be completely
paralyzed and would be carried to the burrow of
the wasp where an egg would be laid upon it from
which a tiny maggot would presently hatch then
weeks of agony for the great gray worm conscious
but unable to move while the maggot fed upon its
living flesh-

  there the tiny spider youngest of hatchlings
barely four inches across stealthily stalked some
other still tinier mite the little many-legged larva
of the oil-beetle known as the bee-louse the al-
most infinitely small bee-louse was barely two
inches long and could easily hide in the thick fur
of a great bumblebee

  this one small creature would never fulfill its
destiny however the hatchling spider sprang-
it was a combat of midgets which was soon over
when tle spider had grown and was feared as a
huge black-bellied tarantula it would slay monster
crickets with the same ease and the same implac-
able ferocity

  the outcropping of rock looked still and innocent
there was one point where it overhung forming a
shelf beneath which the stone fell away in a sheer-
drop many colored fungus growths covered the
rock making it a riot of tints and shades but
hanging from the rooflike projection of the stone
there was a strange drab-white object it was in
the shape of half a globe perhaps six feet by six
feet at its largest a number of little semicircular
doors were fixed about its sides like inverted arches
each closed by a blank wall one of them would
open but only one

  the house was like the half of a pallid orange
fastened to the roof of rock thick cables stretched
in every direction for yards upon yards anchoring
the habitation firmly but the most striking of the
things about the house-still and quiet and innocent
like all the rest of the rock outcropping-were the
ghastly trophies fastened to the outer walls and
hanging from long silken chains below

  here was the hind leg of one of the smaller
beetles there was the wing-case of a flying crea-
ture here a snail-shell two feet in diameter hang-
ing at the end of an inch-thick cable there a
boulder that must have weighed thirty or forty
pounds dangling in similar fashion

  but fastened here and there haphazard and ir-
regularly were other more repulsive remnants
the shrunken head-armor of a beetle the fierce jaws
pi a cricket-the pitiful shreds of a hundred crea-

tures that had formed forgotten meals for the
bloated insect within the home

  comparatively small as was the nest of the clotho
spider it was decorated as no ogres castle had ever
been adorned-legs sucked dry of their contents
corselets of horny armor forever to be unused by
any creature a wing of this insect the head of that
and dangling by the longest cord of all with a
silken cable wrapped carefully about it to keep the
parts together was the shrunken shriveled dried-
up body of a long-dead man

  outside the nest was a place of gruesome relics
within it was a place of luxury and ease a
cushion of softest down filled all the bulging bottom
of the hemisphere a canopy of similarly luxurious
texture interposed itself between the rocky roof and
the dark hideous body of the resting spider

  the eyes of the hairy creature glittered like
diamonds even in the darkness but the loathsome
attenuated legs were tucked under the round-bellied
body and the spider was at rest it had fed

  it waited motionless without desires or aver-
sions without emotions or perplexities in comfort-
able placid machinelike contentment until time
should bring the call to feed again

  a fresh carcass had been added to the decorations
of the nest only the night before for many days
the spider would repose in motionless splendor with-
in the silken castle when hunger came again a
nocturnal foray a creature would be pounced upon
and slain brought bodily to the nest and feasted
upon its body festooned upon the exterior and an-
other half-sleeping half-waking period of dreamful
idleness within the sybaritic charnel-house would
ensue

  slowly and timidly half a dozen pink-skinned
creatures made their way through the mushroom
forest that led to the out-cropping of rock under
which the clotho spiders nest was slung they
were men degraded remnants of the once dominant
race

  burl was their leader and was distinguished
solely by two three-foot stumps of the feathery
golden antennas of a night-flying moth he had bound
to his forehead in his hand was a horny chitinous
spear taken from the body of an unknown flying
creature killed by the flames of the burning purple
hills

  since burls return from his solitary-and in-
voluntary-journey he had been greatly revered by
his tribe hitherto it had been but a leaderless
formless group of people creeping to the same hid-
ing-place at nightfall to share in the food of the
fortunate and shudder at the fate of those who
might not appear

  now burl had walked boldly to them bearing
upon his back the gray bulk of a labyrinth spider
he had slain with his own hands and clad in wonder-
ful garments of a gorgeousness they envied and
admired they hung upon his words as he
struggled to tell them of his adventures and slowly
and dimly they began to look to him for leadership
he was wonderful for days they had listened
breathlessly to the tale of his adventures but when
he demanded that they follow him in another and
more perilous affair they were appalled
the red dust



  a peculiar strength of will had come to burl he
had seen and done things that no man in the memory
of his tribe had seen or done he had stood by
when the purple hills burned and formed a funeral
pyre for the horde of army ants and for uncounted
thousands of flying creatures he had caught a
leaping tarantula upon the point of his spear and
had escaped from the web of a banded web-spider
by oiling his body so that the sticky threads of the
snare refused to hold him fast he had attacked
and killed a great gray labyrinth spider

  but most potent of all he had returned and had
been welcomed by saya-saya of the swift feet
and slender limbs whose smile roused strange
emotions in bulls breast

  it was the adoring gaze of saya that had roused
burl to this last pitch of rashness months before
the clotho spider in the hemispherical silk castle
of the gruesome decorations had killed and eaten
one of the men of the tribe burl and the spiders
victim had been together when the spider appeared
and the first faint gray light of morning barely
silhouetted the shaggy horrible creature as it
leaped from ambush behind a toadstool toward the
fear-stricken pair

  its attenuated legs were outstretched its-man-
dibles gaped wide and its jaws clashed horribly as
it formed a black blotch in mid air against the
lightening sky

  burl had fled screaming when the other man
was seized now however he was leading half a
dozen trembling men toward the inverted dome in
which the spider dozed two or three of them bore
spears like burl himself but they bore them awk-
wardly and timorously burl himself was possessed
by a strange fictitious courage it was the utter
recklessness of youth coupled with the eternal
masculine desire to display prowess before a desired
female

  the wavering advance came to a halt mostfof
the naked men stopped from fear but burl stopped
to invoke his newly discovered inner self that had
furnished him with such marvelous plans quite
accidentally he had found that if he persistently
asked himself a question some sort of answer came
from within

  now he gazed up from a safe distance and asked
himself how he and the others were to slay the
clotho spider the nest was some forty feet from
the ground on the undersurface of a shelf of rock
there was sheer open space beneath it but it was
firmly held to its support by long silken cables that
curled to the upper side of the rock-shelf clinging
to the stone

  burl gazed and presently an idea came to him
he beckoned to the others to follow him and they
did so their knees knocking together from their
fright at the slightest alarm they would flee
screaming in fear but burl did not plan that there
should be any alarm

  he led them to the rear of the singular rock
formation up the gently sloping side and toward
the precipitous edge he drew near the point where
the rock fell away a long tentacle-like silk cable
curled up over the edge of a little promontory of
stone that jutted out into nothingness

  burl began to feel oddly cold and something of
the panic of the other men communicated itself to
him this was one of the anchoring cables that
held the spiders castle secure he looked and found
others six or seven in all which performed the task
of keeping the shaggy horrid ogres home from
falling to the ground below

  his idea did not desert him however and he
drew back to whisper orders to his followers they
obeyed him solely because they were afraid and he
spoke in an authoritative tone but they did obey
and brought a dozen heavy boulders of perhaps
forty pounds weight each

  burl grasped one of the silken cables at its end
and tore it loose from the rock for a space of per-
haps two yards his flesh crawled as he did so
but something within him drove him on then
while beads of perspiration stood out on his fore-
head-induced by nothing less than cold physical
fear-he tied the boulder to the cable the first
one done he felt emboldened and made a second
fast and a third

  one of his men stood near the edge of the rock
listening in agonized apprehension burl had soon
tied a heavy stone to each of the cables he saw and
as a matter of fact there was but one of them he
failed to notice that one had been covered by the
flaking mold that took the place of grass upon the
rocky eminence

  there were left upon the promontory several of
the boulders for which there was no use but bur
did not attempt to double the weights on the cables
he took his followers aside and explained his plan
in whispers quaking they agreed and trembling
they prepared to carry it out

  one of them stationed himself beside each of the
boulders burl at the largest he gave a signal and
half a dozen ripping tearing sounds broke the sullen
silence of the day the boulders clashed and clat-
tered down the rocky side of the precipice tearing
-perhaps peeling-the cables from their ad-
hesion to the stone they shot into open space and
jerked violently at the half-globular nest which was
wrenched from its place by the combined impetus
of the six heavy weights

  burl had flung himself upon his face to watch
what he was sure would be the death of the spider
as it fell forty feet and more imprisoned in its
heavily weighted home his eyes sparkled with
triumph as he saw the ghastly trophy-laden house
swing out from the cliff then he gasped in terror

  one of the cables had not been discovered that
single cable held the spiders castle from a fall
though the nest had been torn from its anchorage
and now dangled heavily on its side in mid air
a convulsive struggle seemed to be going on within

  then one of the archlike doors opened and the
spider emerged evidently in terror and confused
by the light of day but still venomous and still
deadly it found but a single of its anchoring cables
intact that leading to the cliff top hard by burls
head	

  the spider sprang for this single cable and its
legs grasped the slender thread eagerly while it
began to climb rapidly up toward the cliff top

  as with all the creatures of burls time its first


amazing stories

thought was of battle not flight and it came up the
thin cord with its poison fangs unsheathed and its
mandibles clashing in rage the shaggy hair upon
its body seemed to bristle with insane ferocity and
the horrible thin legs moved with desperate haste
as it hastened to meet and wreak vengeance upon
the cause of its sudden alarm

  burls followers fled uttering shrieks of fear
and burl started to his feet in the grip of a terrible
panic then his hand struck one of the heavy
boulders exerting every ounce of his strength
he pushed it over the cliff just where the cable ap-
peared above the edge for the fraction of a second
there was silence and then the indescribable sound
of an impact against a soft body

  there was a gasping cry and a moment later the
curiously muffled clatter of the boulder striking the
earth below somehow the sound suggested that
the boulder had struck first upon some soft object

  a faint cry came from the bottom of the hill the
last of burls men was leaping to a hiding-place
among the mushrooms of the forest and had seen
the sheen of shining armor just before him he
cried out and waited for death but only a delicately
formed wasp rose heavily into the air bearing be-
neath it the more and more feebly struggling body
of a giant cricket

  burl had stood paralyzed deprived of the power
of movement after casting the boulder over the
cliff that one action had taken the last ounce
of his initiative and if the spider had hauled itself
over the rocky edge and darted toward him slaver-
ing its thick spittle and uttering sounds of mad
fury burl would not even have screamed as it seized
him he was like a dead thing but the oddly
muffled sound of the boulder striking the ground
below brought back hope of life and power of
movement

  he peered over the cliff the nest still dangled
at the end of the single cable still freighted with
its gruesome trophies but on the ground below a
crushed and horribly writhing form was moving
in convulsions of rage and agony

  long hairy legs worked desperately from a body
that was no more than a mass of pulped flesh a
ferocious jaw tried to clamp upon something-and
there was no other jaw to meet it an evil-smelling
sticky liquid exuded from the mangled writhing
thing upon the earth moving in terrible contortions
of torment

  presently an ant drew near and extended inquisi-
tive antennae at the helpless monster wounded to
death a shrill stridulation sounded out and three
or four other foot-long ants hastened up to wait
patiently just outside the spiders reach until its
struggles should have lessened enough to make pos-
sible the salvage of flesh from the perhaps still-
living creature for the ant city a mile away

  and burl up on the cliff-top danced and gesti-
culated in triumph he had killed the clotho spider
which had slain one of the tribesmen four months
before glory was his all the tribesmen had seen
the spider living now he would show them the
spider dead he stopped his dance of triumph and
walked down the hill in haughty grandeur he
would reproach his timid followers for fleeing from
the spider leaving him to kill it alone

  quite naively burl assumed that it was his place
to give orders and that of the others to obey true
no one had attempted to give orders before or to
enforce their execution but burl had reached the
eminently wholesome conclusion that he was a won-
derful person whose wishes should be respected

  burl filled with fresh notions of his own import-
ance strutted on toward the hiding-place of the
tribe growing more and more angry with the other
men for having deserted him he would reproach
them would probably beat them they would be
afraid to protest and in the future would undoubt-
edly be afraid to run away

  burl was quite convinced that running away
was something he could not tolerate in his followers
obscurely-and conveniently in the extreme back of
his mind-he reasoned that not only did a larger
number of men present at a scene of peril increase
the chances of coping with the danger but they also
increased the chances that the victim selected by
the dangerous creature would be another than him-
self

  burls reasoning was unsophisticated but sound
perhaps unconscious but none the less effective
he grew quite furious with the deserters they
had run away they had fled from a mere spider

  a shrill whine filled the air and a ten-inch ant
dashed at burl with its mandibles extended threaten-
ingly burls path had promised to interrupt the
salvaging work of the insect engaged in scraping
shreds of flesh from the corselet of one of the
smaller beetles slain the previous night the ant
dashed at burl like an infuriated fox-terrier and
burl scurried away in undignified retreat the ant
might not be dangerous but bites from its formic
acid-poisoned mandibles were no trifles

  burl came to the tangled thicket of mushrooms
in which his tribe-folk hid the entrance was
tortuous and difficult to penetrate and could be
blocked on occasion with stones and toadstool pulp
burl made his way toward the central clearing and
heard as he went the sound of weeping and the
excited chatter of the tribes people

  those who had fled from the rocky cliff had re-
turned with the news that burl was dead and saya
lay weeping beneath an ovfer-shadowing toadstool
she was not yet the mate of burl but the time
would come when all the tribe would recognize a
status dimly different from the usual tribal relation-
ship

  burl stepped into the clearing and straightway
cuffed the first man he came upon then the next
and the rfext there was a cry of astonishment
and the next second instinctive fearful glances at
that entrance to tlfe hiding-place

  had burl fled from the spider and was it follow-
ing burl spoke loftily saying that the spider was
dead that its legs each one the length of a man
were still and its fierce jaws and deadly poison-
fangs harmless forevermore

  ten minutes later he was leading an incredulous
awed little group of pink-skinned people to the spot
below the cliff where the spider actually lay dead
with the ants busily at work upon its remains

  and when he went back to the hiding-place he
donned again his great cloak that was made from
the wing of a magnificent moth slain by the flames
the red dust



of the purple hills and sat down in splendor upon a
crumbling toadstool to feast upon the glances of
admiration and awe that were sent toward him
only saya held back shyly until he motioned for
her to draw near when she seated herself at his
feet and gazed up at him with unutterable adoration
in her eyes

  but while burl basked in the radiance of his
tribes admiration danger was drawing near them
all for many months there had been strange red
mushrooms growing slowly here and there all over
the earth they knew the tribe-folk had speculated
about them but forebore tasting them because
they were strange and strange things were
usually dangerous and often fatal

  now those red growths had ripened and grown
ready to emit their spores their rounded tops
had grown fat and the tough skin grew taut as if
a strange pressure were being applied from within
and to-day while burl luxuriated in his position of
feared and admired great man of his tribe at a spot
a long distance away upon a hill-top one of the
red mushrooms burst the spores inside the taut
tough skin shot all about as if scattered by an ex-
plosion and made a little cloud of reddish im-
palpable dust which hung in the air and moved
slowly with the sluggish breeze

  a bee droned into the thin red cloud of dust
lazily and heavily flying back toward the hive but
barely had she entered the tinted atmosphere when
her movements became awkward and convulsive
effortful and excited she trembled and twisted in
mid air in a peculiar fashion then dropped to the
earth while her abdomen moved violently

  bees like almost all insects breathe through
spiracles on the undersurfaces of their abdomens
this bee had breathed in some of the red mush-
rooms spores she thrashed about desperately
upon the toadstools on which she had fallen strug-
gling for breath for life

  after a long time she was still the cloud of
red mushroom spores had strangled or poisoned her
and everywhere the red fringe grew such explo-
sions were taking place one by one and wherever
the red clouds hung in the air creatures were breath-
ing them in and dying in convulsions of strangula-
tion

chapter ii

the journey

darkness the soft blanketing night of
the age of fungoids had fallen over all the
earth and there was blackness everywhere
that was not good to have here and there how-
ever dim bluish lights glowed near the ground
there an intermittent glow showed that a fire-fly
had wandered far from the rivers and swamps
above which most of his kind now congregated now
a faintly luminous ball of fire drifted above the
steaming moisture-sodden earth it was a will-o-
the-wisp grown to a yard in diameter

  from the low-hanging banks of clouds that hung
perpetually overhead large warm raindrops fell
ceaselessly a drop a pause and then another drop

added to the already dank moisture of the ground
below

  the world of fungus growths flourished on just
such dampness and humidity it seemed as if the
toadstools and mushrooms could be heard swelling
and growing large in the darkness rustlings and
stealthy movements sounded furtively through the
night and from above the heavy throb of mighty
wing-beats was continuous

  the tribe was hidden in the midst of a tangled
copse of toadstools too thickly interwoven for the
larger insects to penetrate only the little midgets
hid in its recesses during the night-time and the
smaller moths during the day

  about and among the bases of the toadstools
however where their spongy stalks rose from the
humid earth small beetles roamed singing cheer-
fully to themselves in deep bass notes they were
small and round some six or eight inches long and
their bellies were pale gray

  and as they went about they emitted sounds
which would have been chirps had they been other
than low as the lowest tone of a harp they were
truffle-beetles in search of the dainty tidbits on
which epicures once had feasted

  some strange sense seemed to tell them when one
of half a dozen varieties of truffle was beneath
them and they paused in their wandering to dig a
tunnel straight down a foot two feet or two
yards all was the same to them in time they would
come upon the morsel they sought and would re-
main at the bottom of their temporary home until
it was consumed then another period of wander-
ing singing their cheerful song until another likely
spot was reached and another tunnel begun

  in a tiny open space in the center of the toad-
stool thicket the tribe-folk slept with the deep notes
of the truffle-beetles in their ears a new danger
had come to them but they had passed it on to burl
with a new and childlike confidence and considered
the matter settled they slept while beneath a glow-
ing mushroom at one side of the clearing burl
struggled with his new problem he squatted upon
the ground in the dim radiance of the shining toad-
stool his moth-wing cloak wrapped about him his
spear in his hand and his twin golden plumes of
the moths antennae bound to his forehead but his
face was downcast as a childs

  the red mushrooms had begun to burst only
that day one of the women seeking edible fungus
for the tribal larder had seen the fat distended
globule of the red mushroom its skin was stretched
taut and glistened in the light

  the woman paid little or no attention to the red
growth her ears were attuned to catch sounds
that would warn her of danger while her eyes
searched for tidbits that would make a meal for the
tribe and more particularly for her small son left
behind at the hiding-place

  a ripping noise made her start up alert on the
instant the red envelope of the mushroom had
split across the top and a thick cloud of brownish-
red dust was spurting in every direction it formed
a pyramidal cloud some thirty feet in height which
enhrged and grew thinner with minor eddies within
itself

  a little yellow butterfly with wings barely a yard


amazing stories

from tip to tip flapped lazily above the mushroom-
covered plain its wings beat the air with strokes
that seemed like playful taps upon a friendly
element the butterfly was literally intoxicated
with the sheer joy of living it had emerged from
its cocoon barely two hours before and was making
its maiden flight above the strange and wonderful
world it fluttered carelessly into the red-brown
cloud of mushroom spores

  the woman was watching the slowly changing
form of the spore-mist she saw the butterfly enter
the brownish dust and then her eyes became greedy
there was something the matter with the butter-
fly its wings no longer moved lazily and gently
they struck out in frenzied hysterical blows that
were erratic and wild the little yellow creature no
longer floated lightly and easily but dashed here
and there wildly and without purpose seeming to
be in its death-throes

  it crashed helplessly against the ground and lay
there moving feebly the woman hurried forward
the wings would be new fabric with which to adorn
herself and the fragile legs of the butterfly con-
tained choice meat she entered the dust-cloud

  a stream of intolerable fire-though the woman
had never seen or known of fire-burned her
nostrils and seared her lungs she gasped in pain
and the agony was redoubled her eyes smarted as
if burning from their sockets and tears blinded
her

  the woman instinctively turned about to flee but
before she had gone a dozen yards-blinded as she
was-she stumbled and fell to the ground she lay
there gasping and uttering moans of pain until
one of the men of the tribe who had been engaged
in foraging near by saw her and tried to find what
had injured her

  she could not speak and he was about to leave
her and tell the other tribe-folk about her when he
heard the clicking of an ants limbs and rather than
have the ant pick her to pieces bit by bit-and leave
his curiosity ungratified-the man put her across
his shoulders and bore her back to the hiding-place
of the tribe

  it was the tale the woman had told when she
partly recovered that caused burl to sit alone all
that night beneath the shining toadstool in the little
clearing puzzling his just-awakened brain to know
what to do

  the year before there had been no red mush-
rooms they had appeared only recently but burl
dimly remembered that one day a long time before
there had been a strange breeze which blew for
three day and nights and that during the time of
its blowing all the tribe had been sick and had wept
continually

  burl had not yet reached the point of mental
development when he would associate that breeze
with a storm at a distance or reason that the spores
of the red mushrooms had been borne upon the
wind to the present resting-places of the deadly
fungus growths still less could he decide that the
breeze had not been deadly only because it was
lightly laden with the fatal dust

  he knew simply that unknown red mushrooms
had appeared that they were everywhere about and
that they would burst and that to breathe the red

dust they gave out was grievous sickness or death

  the tribe slept while the bravely attired figure of
burl squatted under the glowing disk of the lumin-
ous mushroom his face a picture of querulous per-
plexity and his heart full of sadness

  he had consulted his strange inner self and no
plan had come to him he knew the red mushrooms
were all about they would fill the air with their
poison he struggled with his problem while his
people slumbered and the woman who had breathed
the mushroom-dust sobbed softly in her troubled
sleep

  presently a figure stirred on the farther side of
the clearing saya woke and raised her head she
saw burl crouching by the shining toadstool his
gay attire draggled and unnoticed she watched
him for a little and the desolation of his pose awoke
her pity

  she rose and went to his side taking his hand
between her two while she spoke hi name softly
when he turned and looked at her confusion smote
her but the misery in his face brought confidence
again

  burls sorrow was inarticulate-he could not ex-
plain this new responsibility for his people that
had come to him-but he was comforted by her
presence and she sat down beside him after a
long time she slept with her head resting against
his side but he continued to question himself con-
tinued to demand an escape for his people from the
suffering and danger he saw ahead with the day
an answer came

  when burl had been carried down the river on
his fungus raft and had landed in the country of
the army ants he had seen great forests of edible
mushrooms and had said to himself that he would
bring saya to that place he remembered now
that the red mushrooms were there also but the
idea of a journey remained

  the hunting-ground of his tribe had been free of
the red fungoids until recently if he traveled far
enough he would come to a place where there were
still no red toadstools then came the decision
he would lead his tribe to a far country

  he spoke with stern authority when the tribes-
men woke talking in few words and in a loud voice
holding up his spear as he gave his orders

  the timid pink-skinned people obeyed him
meekly they had seen the body of the clotho spider
he had slain and he had thrown down before them
the gray bulk of the labyrinth spider he had thrust
through with his spear now he was to take them
through unknown dangers to an unknown haven
but they feared to displease him

  they made light loads of their mushrooms and
such meat-stuffs as they had and parceled out what
little fabric they still possessed three men bore
spears in addition to burls long shaft and he had
persuaded the other three to carry clubs showing
them how the weapon should be wielded

  the indefinitely brighter spot in the cloud-banks
above that meant the shining sun had barely gone
a quarter of the way across the sky when the
trembling band of timid creatures made their way
from their hiding-place and set out upon their
journey for their course burl depended entirely
upon chance he avoided the direction of the river
the red dust



however and the path along which he had returned
to his people he knew the red mushrooms grew
there purely by accident he set his march toward
the west and walked cautiously on his tribes-folk
following him fearfully

  burl walked ahead his spear held ready he
made a figure at once brave and pathetic ventur-
ing forth in a world of monstrous ferocity and in-
credible malignance armed only with a horny spear
borrowed from a dead insect his velvety cloak
made from a moths wing hung about his figure
in graceful folds however and twin golden plumes
nodded jauntily from his forehead

  behind him the nearly naked people followed re-
luctantly here a woman with a baby in her arms
there children of nine or ten unable to resist the
instinct to play even in the presence of the manifold
dangers of the march they ate hungrily of the
lumps of mushroom they had been ordered to carry
then a long-legged boy his eyes roving anxiously
about in search of danger followed

  thirty thousand years of flight from every peril
had deeply submerged the combative nature of
humanity after the boy came two men one with a
short spear and the other with a club each with a
huge mass of edible mushroom under his free arm
and both badly frightened at the idea of fleeing
from dangers they knew and feared to dangers they
did not know and consequently feared much more

  so was the caravan spread out it made its way
across the country with many deviations from a
fixed line and with many halts and pauses once
a shrill stridulation filled all the air before them a
monster sound compounded of innumerable clickings
and high-pitched cries

  they came to the tip of an eminence and saw
a great space of ground covered with tiny black
bodies locked in combat for quite half a mile in
either direction the earth was black with ants
snapping and biting at each other locked in vise-
like embraces each combatant couple trampled un-
der the feet of the contending armies with no
thought of surrender or quarter

  the sound of the clashing of fierce jaws upon
horny armor the cries of the maimed and strange
sounds made by the dying and above all the whin-
ing battle-cry of each of the fighting hordes made
a sustained uproar that was almost deafening

  from either side of the battle-ground a pathway
led back to separate ant-cities a pathway marked by
the hurrying groups of reinforcements rushing to
the fight tiny as the ants were for once no lumber-
ing beetle swaggered insolently in their path nor
did the hunting-spiders mark them out for prey
only little creatures smaller than the combatants
themselves made use of the insect war for purposes
of their own

  these were litle gray ants barely more than four
inches long who scurried about in and among the
fighting creatures with marvelous dexterity carry-
ing off piece-meal the bodies of the dead and slay-
ing the wounded for the same fate

  they hung about the edges of the battle and in-
vaded the abandoned areas when the tide of battle
shifted insect guerillas fighting for their own
hands careless of the origin of the quarrel espous-

ing no cause simply salvaging the dead and living
debris of the combat

  burl and his little group of followers had to make
a wide detour to avoid the battle itself and the
passage between bodies of reinforcements hurrying
to the scene of strife was a matter of some difficulty
the ants running rapidly toward the battle-field
were hugely excited their antennas waved wildly
and the infrequent wounded one limping back to-
ward the city was instantly and repeatedly chal-
lenged by the advancing insects

  they crossed their antennae upon his and re-
quired thorough evidence that he was of the proper
city before allowing him to proceed once they
arrived at the battle-field they flung themselves into
the fray becoming lost and indistinguishable in the
tide of straining fighting black bodies

  men in such a battle without distinguishing
marks or battle-cries would have fought among
themselves as often as against their foes but the
ants had a much simpler method of identification
each ant-city possesses its individual odor-a
variant on the scent of formic acid-and each in-
dividual of that city is recognized in his world quite
simply and surely by the way he smells

  the little tribe of human beings passed pre-
cariously behind a group of a hundred excited in-
sect warriors and before the following group of
forty equally excited black insects burl hurried
on with his following putting many miles of peril
ous territory behind before nightfall many times
during the day they saw the sudden billowing of a
red-brown dust-cloud from the earth and more
than once they came upon the empty skin and
drooping stalk of one of the red mushrooms and
more often still they came upon the mushrooms
themselves grown fat and taut prepared to send
their deadly spores into the air when the pressure
from within became more than the leathery skin
could stand

  that night the tribe hid among the bases of giant
puff-balls which at a touch shot out a puff of white
powder resembling smoke the powder was pre-
cisely the same in nature as that cast out by the
red mushrooms but its effects were marvelously-
and mercifully-different it was innocuous

  burl slept soundly this night having been two
days and a night without rest but the remainder
of his tribe and even saya were fearful and afraid
listening ceaselessly all through the dark hours for
the menacing sounds of creatures coming to prey
upon them

  and so for a week the march kept on burl
would not allow his tribe to stop to forage for food
the red mushrooms were all about once one of
the little children was caught in a whirling eddy of
red dust and its mother rushed into the deadly
stuff to seize it and bring it out then the tribe
had to hide for three days while the two of them
recovered from the debilitating poison

  once too they found a half-acre patch of the
giant cabbages-there were six of them full grown
and a dozen or more smaller ones-and burl took
two men and speared two of the huge twelve-foot
slugs that fed upon the leaves when the tribe
passed on it was gorged on the fat meat of the slugs


amazing stories

and there was much soft fur so that all the tribe-
folk wore loin-cloths of the yellow stuff

  there were perils too in the journey on the
fourth day of the tribes traveling burl froze sud-
denly into stillness one of the hairy tarantulas-
a trap-door spider with a black belly-had fallen
upon a scarabaeus beetle and was devouring it only
a hundred yards ahead

  the tribe-folk trembling went back for half a
mile or more in panic-stricken silence and refused
to advance until he had led them a detour of two
or three miles to one side of the dangerous spot

  long fear-ridden marches through perilous coun-
tries unknown to them through the golden aisles of
yellow mushroom forests over the flaking surfaces
of plains covered with many-colored rusts and
molds pauses beside turbid pools whose waters
were concealed by thick layers of green slime and
other evil-smelling ponds which foamed and bubbled
slowly which were covered with pasty yeasts that
rose in strange forms of discolored foam

  fleeting glimpses they had of the glistening
spokes of symmetrical spiders-webs whose least
thread it would have been beyond the power of the
strongest of the tribe to break they passed through
a forest of puff-balls which boomed when touched
and shot a puff of vapor from their open mouths

  once they saw a long and sinuous insect that fled
before them and disappeared into a burrow in the
ground running with incredible speed upon legs
of uncountable number it was a centipede all of
thirty feet in length and when they crossed the
path it had followed a horrible stench came to their
nostrils so that they hurried on

  long escape from unguessed dangers brought
boldness of a sort to the pink-skinned men and
they would have rested they went to burl with
their complaint and he simply pointed with his
hands behind them there were three little clouds
of brownish vapor in the air where they could see
along the road they had traversed to the right of
them a dust-eloud was just settling and to the left
another rose as they looked

  a new trick of the deadly dust became apparent
now toward the end of a day in which they had
traveled a long distance one of the little children
ran a little to the left of the route its elders were
following the earth had taken on a brownish hue
and the child stirred up the surface mould with its
feet

  the brownish dust that had settled there was
raised again and the child ran crying and choking
to its mother its lungs burning as with fire and
its eyes like hot coals another day would pass be-
fore the child could walk

  in a strange country knowing nothing of the
dangers that might assail the tribe while waiting
for the child to recover burl looked about for a
hiding-place far over to the right a low cliff
perhaps twenty or thirty feet high showed sides of
crumbling yellow clay and from where burl stood
he could see the dark openings of burrows scattered
here and there upon its face

  he watched for a time to see if any bee or wasp
inhabited them knowing that many kinds of both
insects dig burrows for their young and do not oc-
cupy them themselves no dark forms appeared

however and he led his people toward the openings

  the appearance of the holes confirmed his sur-
mise they had been dug months before by mining
bees and the entrances were weathered and worn
the tribe-folk made their way into the three-foot
tunnels and hid themselves seizing the opportunity
to gorge themselves upon the food they carried

  burl stationed himself near the outer end of one
of the little caves to watch for signs of danger
while waiting he poked curiously with his spear at
a little pile of white and sticky parchment-like stuff
he saw just within the mouth of the tunnel

  instantly movement became visible fifty sixty
or a hundred tiny creatures no more than half an
inch in length tumbled pell-mell from the dirty-
white heap awkward legs tiny greenish-black
bodies and bristles protruding in every direction
made them strange to look upon

  they had tumbled from the whitish heap and now
they made haste to hide themselves in it again
moving slowly and clumsily with immense effort
and laborious contortions of their bodies

  burl had never seen any insect progress in such
a slow and ineffective fashion before he drew one
little insect back with the point of his spear and
examined it from a safe distance tiny jaws before
the head met like twin sickles and the whole body
was shaped like a rounded diamond lozenge

  burl knew that no insect of such small size could
be dangerous and leaned over then took one crea-
ture in his hand it wriggled frantically and slip-
ped from his fingers dropping upon the soft yellow
caterpillar-fur he had about his middle instantly
as if it were a conjuring trick the little insect van-
ished and burl searched for a matter of minutes
before he found it hidden deep in the long soft hairs
of the fur resting motionless and evidently at ease

  it was a bee-louse the first larval form of a
beetle whose horny armor could be seen in frag-
ments for yards before the clayey cliff-side hid-
den in the openings of the bees tunnel it waited
until the bee-grubs farther back in their separate
cells should complete their changes of form and
emerge into the open air passing over the cluster
of tiny creatures at the door-way as the bees
pass the little bee-lice would clamber in eager
haste up their hairy legs and come to rest in the
fur about their thoraxes then weeks later when
the bees in turn made other cells and stocked them
with honey for the eggs they would lay the tiny
creatures would slip from their resting-places and
be left behind in the fully provisioned cell to eat
not only the honey the bee had so laboriously ac-
quired but the very grub hatched from the bees
egg

  burl had no difficulty in detaching the small in-
sect and casting it away but in doing so discovered
three more that had hidden themselves in his
furry garment no doubt thinking it the coat of
their natural though unwilling hosts he plucked
them away and discovered more and more his
garment was the hiding-place for dozens of the
creatures

  disgusted and annoyed he went out of the cavern
and to a spot some distance away where he took
off his robe and pounded it with the flat side of
his spear to dislodge the visitors they dropped
the red dust



out one by one reluctantly and finally the garment
was clean of them then burl heard a shout from
the direction of the mining-bee caves and hastened
toward the sound

  it was then drawing toward the time of dark-
ness but one of the tribesmen had ventured out
and found no less than three of the great imperial
mushrooms of the three one had been attacked
by a parasitic purple mould but the gorgeous yel-
low of the other two was undimmed and the peo-
ple were soon feasting upon the firm flesh

  b-url felt a little pang of jealousy though he
joined in the consumption of the find as readily
as the others and presently drew a little to one
side

  he cast his eyes across the country level and
unbroken as far as the eye could see the small
clay cliff was the only inequality visible and its
height cut off all vision on one side but the view
toward the horizon was unobstructed on three sides
and here and there the black speck of a monster
bee could be seen droning homeward to its hive
or burrow and sometimes the slender form of a
wasp passed overhead its transparent wings in-
visible from the rapidity of their vibrations

  these flew high in the air but lower down
barely skimming the tops of the many-colored mush-
rooms and toadstools fluttering lightly above the
swollen fungoids and touching their dainty probos-
cides to unspeakable things in default of the
fragrant flowers that were normal food for their
races-lower down flew the multitudes of butter-
flies the age of mushrooms had produced

  white and yellow and red and brown pink and
blue and purple and green every shade and every
color every size and almost every shape they
flitted gaily in the air there were some so tiny
that they would barely have shaded burls face and
some beneath whose slender bodies he could have
hiddeij himself they flew in a riot of colors and
tftits above a world of foul mushroom growths and
turgid slime-covered ponds

  burl temporarily out of the limelight because
of the discovery of a store of food by another mem-
ber of the tribe bethought himself of an idea soon
night would come on the cloud-bank would turn
red in the west and then darkness would lean down-
ward from the sky with the coming of that time
these creatures of the day would seek hiding-
places and the air would be given over to the furry
moths that flew by night he burl would mark the
spot where one of the larger creatures alighted
and would creep up upon it with his spear held fast

  his wide blue eyes brightened at the thought
and he sat himself down to watch after a long
time the soft down-reaching fingers of the night
touched the shaded aisles of the mushroom forests
and a gentle haze arose above the golden glades
one by one the gorgeous fliers of the daytime dip-
ped down and furled their painted wings the over-
hanging clouds became darker-finally black and
the slow deliberate rainfall that lasted all through
the night began burl rose and crept away into
the darkness his spear held in readiness

  through the black night beneath deeper black-
nesses which were the dark undersides of huge
toadstools creeping silently with every sense alert

for sign of danger or for hope of giant prey burl
made his slow advance

  a glorious butterfly of purple and yellow mark-
ings whose wings spread out for three yards on
either side of its delicately formed body had hidden
itself barely two hundred yards away burl could
imagine it now preening its slender limbs and
combing from its long and slender proboscis any
trace of the delectable foodstuffs on which it had
fed during the day burl moved slowly and
cautiously forward all eyes and ears

  he heard an indescribable sound in a thicket a
little to his left and shifted his course the sound
was the faint whistling of air through the breath-
ing-holes along an insects abdomen then came
the delicate rustling of filmy wings being stretched
and closed again and the movement of sharply
barbed feet upon the soft earth burl moved in
breathless silence holding his spear before him
in readiness to plunge it into the gigantic butter-
flys soft body

  the mushrooms here were grown thickly to-
gether so there was no room for burls body to pass
between their stalks and the rounded heads were
deformed and misshapen from their crowdings burl
spent precious moments in trying to force a silent
passage but had to own himself beaten then he
clambered up upon the spongy mass of mushroom
heads trusting to luck that they would sustain his
weight

  the blackness was intense so that even the forms
of objects before him were lost in obscurity he
moved forward for some ten yards however walk-
ing gingerly over his precarious foothold then he
felt rather than saw the opening before him a
body moved below him

  burl raised his spear and with a yell plunged
down on the back of the moving thing thrusting
his spear with all the force he could command he
landed on a shifting form but his yell of triumph
turned to a scream of terror

  this was not the yielding body of a slender but-
terfly that he had come upon nor had his spear
penetrated the creatures soft flesh he had fallen
upon the shining back of one of the huge meat-
eating beetles and his spear had slid across the
horny armor and then stuck fast having pierced
only the leathery tissue between the insects head
and thorax

  burls terror was pitiable at the realization but
as nothing to the ultimate panic which possessed
him when the creature beneath him uttered a grunt
of fright and pain and spreading its stiff wing-
cases wide shot upward in a crazy panic-stricken
rocket-like flight toward the sky

chapter iii

the sexton-beetles

burl fell headforemost upon the spongy top
of a huge toadstool that split with the im-
pact and let him through to the ground be-
neath powdering him with its fine spores he
came to rest with his naked shoulder half-way
through the yielding flesh of a mushroom-stalk and


amazing stories

lay there for a seoond catching his breath to scream
again

  then he heard the whining buzz of his attempted
prey there was something wrong with the beetle
burls spear had struck it in an awkward spot and
it was rocketing upward in erratic flight that
ended in a crash two or three hundreds yards away

  burl sprang up in an instant perhaps despite
his mistake he had slain this infinitely more worthy
victim he rushed toward the spot where it had
fallen

  his wide blue eyes pierced the darkness well
enough to enable him to sheer off from masses of
toadstools but he could distinguish no details-
nothing but forms he heard the beetle floundering
upon the ground then heard it mount again into
the air more clumsily than before

  its wing-beats no longer kept up a sustained note
they thrashed the air irregularly and wildly the
flight was zigzag and uncertain and though longer
than the first had been it ended similarly in a
heavy fall another period of floundering and the
beetle took to the air again just before burl ar-
rived at the spot

  it was obviously seriously hurt and burl forgot
the dangers of the night in his absorption in the
chase he darted after his prey fleet-footed and
agile taking chances that in cold blood he would
never have thought of

  twice in the pain-racked struggles of the mon-
ster beetle he arrived at the spot where the gigantic
insect flung itself about madly insanely fighting
it knew not what striking out with colossal wings
and legs dazed and drunk with agony and each
time it managed to get aloft in flight that was
weaker and more purposeless

  crazy fleeing from the torturing spear that
pierced its very vitals the beetle blundered here
and there floundering among the mushroom
thickets in spasms that were constantly more pro-
longed and more agonized but nevertheless flying
heavily lurching drunkenly managing to graze the
tops of the toadstools in one more despairing tor-
mented flight

  and burl followed aflame with the fire of the
chase arriving at the scene of each successive
panic-stricken struggle on the ground just after the
beetle had taken flight again but constantly more
closely on the heels of the weakening monster

  at last he came up panting and found the giant
lying upon the earth moving feebly apparently
unable to rise how far he was from the tribe
burl did not know nor did the question occur
to him at the moment he waited for the beetle
to be still trembling with excitement and eager-
ness the struggles of the huge form grew more
feeble and at last ceased burl moved forward and
grasped his spear he wrenched at it to thrust
again

  in an instant the beetle had roused itself and
was exerting its last atom of strength galvanized
into action by the agony caused by burls seizure
of the spear a great wing-cover knocked burl
twenty feet and flung him against the base of a
mushroom where he lay half stunned but then
a strangely pungent scent came to his nostrils-
the scent of the red mushrooms

  he staggered to his feet and fled while behind
him the gigantic beetle crashed and floundered-
burl heard a tearing and ripping sound the in-
sect had torn the covering of one of the red mush-
rooms tightly packed with the fatal red dust at
the noise burls speed was doubled but he could
still hear the frantic struggles of the dying beetle
grow to a very crescendo of desperation

  the creature broke free and managed to rise in
a final flight fighting for breath and life weakened
and tortured by the spear and the horrible spores
of the red mushrooms then it crashed suddenly to
the earth and was still the red dust had killed it

  in time to come burl might learn to use the red
dust as poison gas had been used by his ancestors
of thirty thousand years before but now he was
frightened and alone lost from his tribe and with
no faintest nation of how to find them he crouched
beneath a hge toadstool and waited for dawn
listening with terrified apprehension for the ripping
sound that would mean the bursting of another of
the red mushrooms

  oaly the wing beats of night-flying creatures came
to his ears however and the discordant noises of
the four-foot truffie-beetles as they roamed the
aisles of the mushroom forests seeking the places
beneath which their instinct told them fungoid
dainties awaited the courageous miner the eternal
dripping of the rain-drops falling at long intervals
from the overhanging clouds formed a soft ob-
bligato to the whole

  burl listened knowing there were red toadstools
all about but not once during the whole of the long
dark hours did the rending noise tell of a bursting
fungus casting loose its freight of deadly dust upon
the air only when day came again and the chill
dampness of the night was succeeded by the steam-
ing humidity of the morning did a tall pyramid of
brownish-red stuff leap suddenly into the air from
a ripped mushroom covering

  then burl stood up and looked around here and
there all over the whole countryside slowly and at
intervals the cones of fatal red sprang into the air
had burl lived thirty thousand years earlier he
might have likened the effect to that of shells
bursting from a leisurely bombardment but as it
was he saw in them only fresh and inexorable
dangers added to an already peril-ridden existence

  a hundred yards from where he had hidden dur-
ing the night the body of his victim lay crumpled
up and limp burl approached speculatively he had
come even before the ants appeared to take their
toll of the carcass and not even a buzzing flesh-fly
had placed its maggots on the unresisting form

  the long whiplike antennae lay upon the carpet
of mold and rust and the fiercely toothed legs were
drawn close against the body the many-faceted
eyes stared unseeingly and the stiff and horny wing-
cases were rent and torn

  when burl went to the other side of the dead
beetle he saw something that filled him with elation
his spear had been held between his body and the
beetles during that mad flight and at the final
crash when burl shot away from the fear-crazed in-
sect the weight of his body had forced the spear-
point between the joints of the corselet and the
neck even if the red dust had not finished the
the red dust



creature the spear wound in time would have ended
its life

  burl was thrilled once more by his superlative
greatness and conveniently forgot that it was the
red dust that had actually administered the coup
de grace it was so much more pleasant to look
upon himself as the mighty slayer that he hacked
off one of the barb-edged limbs to carry back to his
tribe in evidence of his feat he took the long
antennas too as further proof

  then he remembered that he did not know where
his tribe was to be found he had no faintest idea
of the direction in which the beetle had flown as
a matter of fact the course of the beetle had been
in turn directed toward every point of the compass
and there was no possible way of telling the relation
of its final landing-place to the point from which it
had started

  burl wrestled with his problem for an hour and
then gave up in disgust he set off at random
with the leg of the huge insect flung over his
shoulder and the long antennae clasped in his hand
with his spear he turned to look at his victim
of the night before just before plunging into the
near-by mushroom forest and saw that it was al-
ready the center of a mass of tiny black bodies pull-
ing and hacking at the tough armor and carving
out great lumps of the succulent flesh to be carried
to the near-by ant city	

  in the teeming life of the insect world death is
an opportunity for the survivors there is a
strangely tense and fearful competition for the
bodies of the slain there had been barely an hour
of daylight in which the ants might seek for pro-
vender yet in that little time the freshly killed
beetle had been found and was being skilfully and
carefully exploited when the body of one of the
larger insects fell to the ground there was a mighty
rush a fierce race among all the tribes of scaven-
gers to see who should be first

  usually the ants had come upon the scene and
were inquisitively exploring the carcass long be-
fore even the flesh-flies had arrived who dropped
their living maggots upon the creature the blue-
bottles came still later to daub their masses of
white eggs about the delicate membranes of the eye

  and while all the preceding scavengers were at
work furtive beetles and tiny insects burrowed be-
low the reeking body to attack the highly scented
flesh from a fresh angle

  each working independently of the others they
commonly appeared in the order of the delicacy of
the sense which could lead them to a source of food
though accident could and sometimes did afford one
group of workers in putrescence an advantage over
the others

  thus sometimes a blue-bottle anticipated even
the eager ants and again the very flesh-flies drop-
ped their squirming offspring upon a limp form that
was already being undermined by white-bellied
things working in the darkness below the body

  burl grimaced at the busy ants and buzzing flies
and disappeared into the mushroom forest here
for a long time he moved cautiously and silently
through the aisles of tangled stalks and the spongy
round heads of the fungoids now and then he saw
one of the red toadstools and made a wide detour

around it twice they burst within his sight cir-
cumscribed as his vision was by the toadstools
among which he was traveling

  each time he ran hastily to put as much distance
as possible between himself and the deadly red dust
he traveled for an hour or more looking constantly
for familiar landmarks that might guide him to his
tribe he knew that if he came upon any place he
had seen while with his tribe he could follow the
path they had traveled and in time rejoin them

  for many hours he went on alert for signs of
danger he was quite ignorant of the fact that
there were such things as points of the compass and
though he had a distinct notion that he was not
moving in a straight line he did not realize that he
was actually moving in a colossal half-circle after
walking steadily for nearly four hours he was no
more than three miles in a direct line from his
starting-point as it happened his uncertainty of
direction was fortunate

  the night before the tribe had been feeding
happily upon one of the immense edible mushrooms
when they heard burls abruptly changing cry it
had begun as a shout of triumph and ended as a
scream of fear then they heard hurried wing-
beats as a creature rose into the air in a scurry of
desperation the throbbing of huge wings ended
in a heavy fall followed by another flight

  velvety darkness masked the sky and the tribes-
men could only stare off into the blackness where
their leader had vanished and begin to tremble
wondering what they should do in a strange country
with no bold chief to guide them

  he was the first man to whom the tribe had ever
offered allegiance but their submission had been
all the more complete for that fact and his loss
was the more appalling

  burl had mistaken their lack of timidity he
had thought it independence and indifference to
him as a matter of fact it was security because
the tribe felt safe under his tutelage now that he
had vanished and in a fashion that seemed to mean
his death their old fears returned to them reen-
forced by the strangeness of their surroundings

  they huddled together and whispered their 
fright to one another listening the while in panic-
stricken apprehension for signs of danger the
tribesmen visualized burl caught in fiercely toothed
limbs being rent and torn in mid air by horny in-
satiable jaws his blood falling in great spurts to-
ward the earth below they caught a faint reedy
cry and shuddered pressing closer together

  and so through the long night they waited in
trembling silence had a hunting spider appeared
among them they would not have lifted a hand to
defend themselves but would have fled despairingly
would probably have scattered and lost touch with
one another and spent the remainder of their lives
as solitary fugitives snatching fear-ridden rest
in strange hiding-places

  but day came again and they looked into each
others eyes reading in each the selfsame panif
and fear saya was probably the most pitiful oi
all the group burl was to have been her mate ant
her face was white and drawn beyond that of anj
of the rkt of the tribefolk

  with the das they did nojb move but remained


amazing stories

clustered about the huge mushroom on which they
had been feeding the night before they spoke in
hushed and fearful tones huddled together search-
ing all the horizon for insect enemies saya would
not eat but sat still staring before her in unseeing
indifference burl was dead

  a hundred yards from where they crouched a red
mushroom glistened in the pale light of the new
day its tough skin was taut and bulging resisting
the pressure of the spores within but slowly as
the morning wore on some of the moisture that had
kept the skin soft and flaccid during the night
evaporated

  the skin had a strong tendency to contract like
green leather when drying the spores within it
strove to expand the opposing forces produced
a tension that grew greater and greater as more and
more of the moisture was absorbed by the air at
last the skin could hold no longer

  with a ripping sound that could be heard for
hundreds of feet the tough wrapping split and tore
across its top and with a hollow booming noise the
compressed mass of deadly spores rushed into the
air making a pyramidal cloud of brown-red dust
some sixty feet in height

  the tribesmen quivered at the noise and faced the
dust cloud for a fleeting instant then ran pell-
mell to escape the slowly moving tide of death as
the almost imperceptible breeze wafted it slowly
toward them men and women boys and girls they
fled in a mad rush from the deadly stuff not paus-
ing to see that even as it advanced it settled slowly
to the ground nor stopping to observe its path that
they might step aside and let it go safely by

  saya fled with the rest but without their ex-
treme panic she fled because the others had done
so and ran more carelessly struggling with a
half-formed idea that it did not particularly matter
whether she were caught or not

  she fell slightly behind the others without being
noticed then quite abruptly a stone turned under
her foot and she fell headlong striking her head
violently against a second stone then she lay
quite still while the red cloud billowed slowly to-
ward her drifting gently in the faint hardly per-
ceptible breeze

  it drew nearer and nearer settling slowly but
still a huge and menacing mass of deadly dust it
gradually flattened out too so that though it had
been a rounded cone at first it flowed over the minor
inequalities of the ground as a huge and tenuous
leech might have crawled sucking from all breath-
ing creatures the life they had within them

  a hundred and fifty yards away a hundred yards
away then only fifty yards away from where
saya lay unconscious on the earth eddies within the
moving mass could be seen and the edges took on a
striated appearance telling of the curling of the
dust wreaths in the larger mass of deadly powder

  the deliberate advance kept on seeming almost
purposeful it would have seemed possible to draw
from the unhurried menacing movement of the
poisonous stuff that some malign intelligence was
concealed in it that it was in fact a living crea-
ture but when the misty edges of the cloud were
no more than twenty-five yards from sayas pros-
trate body a breeze from one side sprang up-a

vagrant fitful little breeze that first halted the
red cloud and threw it into confusion and then drove
it to one side so that it passed saya without harm-
ing her though a single trailing wisp of dark-red
mist floated very close to her

  then for a time saya lay still indeed only her
breast rising and falling gently with faint and ir-
regular breaths her head had struck a sharp-
edged stone in her fall and a tiny pool of sticky
red had gathered from the wound

  perhaps thirty feet from where she lay three
small toadstools grew in a little clump their bases
so close together that they seemed but one from
between two of them however just where they
parted twin tufts of reddish threads appeared
twinkling back and forth and in and out as if
they had given some reassuring sign two slender
antennas followed then bulging eyes and then a
small black body which had bright-red scalloped
markings upon the wing-cases

  it was a tiny beetle no more than eight inches
long-a burying-beetle it drew near sayas body
and clambered upon her explored the ground by her
side moving all the time in feverish haste and at
last dived into the ground beneath her shoulder
casting back a little shower of hastily dug earth as
it disappeared

  ten minutes later another similar insect appeared
and upon the heels of the second a third each of
them made the same hasty examination and each
dived under the still form presently the earth
seemed to billow at a spot along sayas side then
at another perhaps ten minutes after the arrival
of the third beetle a little rampart had reared itself
all about sayas body precisely following the out-
line of her form then her body moved slightly in
a number of tiny jerks and seemed to settle per-
haps half an inch into the ground

  the burying beetles were of those who exploited
the bodies of the fallen working from below they
excavated the earth from the under side of such
prizes as they came upon then turned upon their
backs and thrust with their legs jerking the body
so it sank into the shallow excavation they had pre-
pared

  the process would be repeated until at last the
whole of the gift of fortune had sunk below the sur-
rounding surface and the loosened earth fell in up-
on the top thus completing the inhumation

  then in the darkness the beetles would feast and
rear their young gorging upon the plentiful supply
of succulent foodstuff they had hidden from jealous
fellow scavengers above them

  but saya was alive thirty thousand years be-
fore when scientists examined into the habits of
the burying-beetles or the sexton-beetles they had
declared that fresh meat or living meat would not
be touched they based their statement solely upon
the fact that the insects then tiny creatures in-
deed did not appear until the trap-meat placed by
the investigators had remained untouched for days

  conditions had changed in thirty thousand years
the ever-present ants and the sharp-eyed flies were
keen rivals of the brightly arrayed beetles usually
the tribes of creatures who worked in the darkness
below ground came after the ants had taken their
toll and the flies sipped daintily
the red dust



  when saya fell unconscious upon the ground
however it was the one accident that caused the
burying-beetle to find her first before the ants had
come to tear the flesh from her slender soft-skinned
body she breathed gently and irregularly her face
drawn with the sorrow of the night before while
desperately hurrying beetles swarmed beneath her
body channeling away the earth so that she would
sink lower and lower into the ground

  an inch and a long wait then she sank slowly
a second inch the bright-red tufts of thread ap-
peared again and a beetle made his way to the
open air he inoved hastily about inspecting the
progress of the work he dived below again an-
other inch and after a long time another inch was
excavated

  burl stepped out from a group of over-shadowing
toadstools and halted he cast his eyes over the
landscape and was struck by its familiarity it was
in point of fact very near the spot he had left
the night before in pursuit of a colossal wounded
beetle

  burl moved back and forth trying to account for
the sensation of recognition and then trying to ap-
proximate the place from which he had last seen it

  he passed within fifty feet of the spot where saya
lay now half buried in the ground the loose earth
cast up about her body had begun to fall in little
rivulets upon her one of her shoulders was al-
ready screened from view

  burl passed on unseeing he was puzzling over
the direction from which he had seen the particular
section of countryside before him perhaps a little
farther on he would come to the place he hurried
a little in a moment he recognized his location
there was the great edible mushroom half broken
away from which the tribe had been feeding there
were the mining bee burrows

  his feet stirred up a fine dust and he stopped
short a red mushroom had covered the earth with
a thin layer of its impalpable deadly powder burl
understood why the tribe had gone and a cold
sweat came upon his body was saya safe
or had the whole tribe succumbed to the poisonous
stuff had they all men and women and children
died in convulsions of gasping strangulation

  he hurried to retrace his footsteps there was
a fragment of mushrooms on the ground here was
a spear cast away by one of the tribesmen in his
flight burl broke into a run

  the little excavation into which saya was sink-
ing inch by inch was all of twenty-five feet to the
right of the path burl dashed on frantic with
anxiety about the tribe but most of all about saya
sayas body quivered and sank a fraction more into
the earth

  half a dozen litle rivulets of dirt were tumbling
upon her body now in a matter of minutes she
would be hidden from view burl ran madly past
her too busy searching the mushroom thickets be-
fore him with his eyes to dream of looking upon the
ground

  twenty yards from a huge toadstool thicket
a noise arrested him sharply there was a crashing
and breaking of the brittle spongy growths twin
tapering antennas appeared and then a monster

beetle lurched into the open space its norrible
gaping jaws stretched wide

  it was all of eight feet long and its body was
held up from the ground by six crooked saw-
toothed limbs its huge multiple eyes stared with
machinelike preoccupation at the world

  it advanced deliberately with a clanking and
clashing as of a hideous machine burl fled on the
instant running as madly away from the beetle as
he had a moment before been running toward it

  a little depression in the earth was before him
he did not swerve but made to leap it as he shot
over it however the glint of pink skin caught his
eye and there was impressed upon his brain with
photographic completeness the picture of saya ly-
ing limp and helpless sinking slowly into the
ground with tiny rills of earth falling down the
sides of -the excavation upon her it seemed to
burls eye that she quivered slightly as he saw

  there was a terrific struggle within burl be-
hind him the colossal meat-eating beetle beneath
him saya whom he loved there was certain death
lurching toward him on evilly glittering legs and
there was life for his race and tribe lying in the
shallow pit

  he turned aware with a sudden reckless glow
that he was throwing away his life aware that
he was deliberately giving himself over to death
and stood on the side of the little pit nearest the
great beetle his puny spear held defiantly at the
ready in his left hand he held just such a leg as
those which bore the living creature toward him
he had torn it from the body of just such a mon-
ster but a few hours ago a monster in whose death
he had had a share with a yell of insane defiance
he flung the fiercely toothed limb at his advancing
opponent

  the sharp teeth cut into the base of one of the
beetles antennae and it ducked clumsily then
seized the missile in its fierce jaws and crushed it
in frenzy of rage there was meat within it sweet
and juicy meat that pleased the beetles palate

  it forgot the man standing there waiting for
death it crunched the missile that had attacked
it eating the palatable contents of the horny armor
confusing the blow with the object that had de-
livered it and evidently satisfied that an enemy had
been conquered and was being devoured a moment
later it turned and lumbered off to investigate an-
other mushroom thicket

  and burl turned quickly and dragged sayas
limp form from the grave that had been prepared
for it by the busy insect scavengers earth fell
from her shoulders from her hair and from the
mass of yellow fur about her middle and three little
beetles with black and red markings scurried in
terrified haste for cover while burl bore saya to a
resting-place of soft mold

  burl was an ignorant savage and to him sayas
deathlike unconsciousness was like death itself but
dumb misery smote him  and he laid her down
gently while tears came to his eyes and he called
her name again and again in an agony of grief

  for an hour he sat there beside her a man so
lately pleased with himself above all creatures for
having slain one huge beetle and put another to

flight as he would have looked upon it now a
broken-hearted little pink-skinned man weeping
like a child hunched up and bowed over with sorrow

  then saya slowly opened her eyes and stirred
weakly

chapter iv

the forest of death

they were oblivious to everything but each
other saya resting in still half-incredulous
happiness against burls shoulder while he
told her in little jerky sentences of his pursuit of
the colossal flying beetle of his search for the tribe
and then his discovery of her apparently lifeless
body

  when he spoke of the monster that had lurched
from the mushroom thicket and of the desperation
with which he had faced it saya pressed close and
looked at him with wondering and wonderful eyes
she could understand his willingness to die believ-
ing her dead a little while before she had felt the
same indifference to life

  a timid frightened whisper roused them from
their absorption and they looked up one of the
tribesmen stood upon one foot some distance away
staring at them almost convinced that he looked
upon the living dead a sudden movement on the
part of either of them would have sent him in a
panic back into the mushroom forest two or three
blond heads bobbed and vanished among the tanglad
stalks wide and astonished eyes gazed at the two
they had believed the prey of malignant creatures

  the tribe had come slowly back to the mushroom
they had been eating leaderless and convinced that
saya had fallen a victiin to the deadly dust in-
stead they found her sitting by the side of their
chief apparently restored to them in some mirac-
ulous fashion

  burl spoke and the pink-skinned people came
timorously from their hiding-places they ap-
proached warily and formed a half-circle before the
seated pair burl spoke again and presently one
of the bravest dared approach and touch him
instantly a babble of the crude and labial language
spoken by the tribe broke out awed questions
and exclamations of thankfulness then curious in-
terrogations filled the air

  burl for once showed some common sense in-
stead of telling them in his usual vainglorious
fashion of the adventures he had undergone he
merely cast down the two long and tapering
antennae from the flying beetle that he had torn
from its dead body they looked at them and
recognized their origin amazement and admiration
showed upon their faces then burl rose and
abruptly ordered two of the men to make a chair
of their hands for saya she was weak from the
effects of the blow she had received the two men
humbly advanced and did as they were bid

  then the march was taken up again more slowly
than before because of saya as a burden but
none the less steadily burl led his people across
the country marching in advance and with every
nerve alert for signs of danger but with more con-

fidence and less timidity than he had ever displayed
before

  all that noontime and that afternoon they filed
steadily along the tribesfolk keeping in a compact
group close behind burl the man who had
thrown away his spear had recovered it on an order
from burl and the little party fairly bristled with
weapons though burl knew well that they were
liable to be cast away as impediments if flight
should be necessary

  he was determined that his people should learn to
fight the great creatures about them instead of de-
pending upon their legs for escape he had led
them in an attack upon great slugs but they were
defenseless creatures incapable of more dangerous
maneuvers than spasmodic jerkings of their great
bodies

  the next time danger should threaten them and
especially if it came while their new awe of him
held good he was resolved to force them to join
him in fighting it

  he had not long to wait for an opportunity to
strengthen the spirit of his followers by a success-
ful battle the clouds toward the west were taking
on a dull-red hue which was the nearest to a sunset
that was ever seen in the world of burls experience
when a bumble bee droned heavily over their heads
making for its hive

  the little group of people on the ground looked
up and saw a scanty load of pollen packed in the
stiff bristles of the insects hind legs the bees of
the world had a hard time securing food upon the
nearly flowerless planet but this one had evidently
made a find its crop was nearly filled with hard-
gathered viscous honey destined for the hival store

  it sped onward heavily its almost transparent
wings mere blurs in the air from the rapidity of
their vibration burl saw its many-faceted eyes
staring before it in worried preoccupation as it
soared in laborious speed over his head some fifty
feet up

  he dropped his glance and then his eyes lighted
with excitement a slender-bodied wasp was shoot-
ing upward from an ambush it had found in a
thicket of toadstools it darted swiftly and grace-
fully upon the bee which swerved and tried to flee
the droning buzz of the bees wings rose to a
higher note as it strove to increase its speed the
more delicately formed wasp headed the clumsier in-
sect back

  the bee turned again and fled in terror each
of the insects was slightly more than four feet in
length but the bee was much the heavier and it
could not attain the speed of which the wasp was
capable

  the graceful form of the hunting insect rapidly
overhauled its fleeing prey and the wasp dashed
in and closed with the bee at a point almost over
the heads of the tribesmen in a clawing biting
tangle of thrashing transparent wings and black
bodies the two creatures tumbled to the earth
they fell perhaps thirty yards from where burl
stood watching

  over and over the two insects rolled now one
uppermost and then the other the bee was strug-
gling desperately to insert her sting in the more
supple body of her adversary she writhed and
the red dust



twisted fighting with jaw and mandible wing and
claw

  the wasp was uppermost and the bee lay on her
back fighting in panic-stricken desperation the
wasp saw an opening her jaws darted in and there
was an instant of confusion then suddenly the
bee dazed was upright with the wasp upon her a
movement too quick for the eye to follow-and the
bee collapsed the wasp had bitten her in the neck
where all the nerve-cords passed and the bee was
dead

  burl waited a moment more aflame with excite-
ment he knew as did all the tribefolk what
might happen next when he saw the second act
of the tragedy well begun burl snapped quick and
harsh orders to his spear-armed men and they fol-
lowed him in a wavering line their weapons tightly
clutched

  knowing the habits of the insects as they were
forced to know them they knew that the venture
was one of the least dangerous they could under-
take with lighting creatures the size of the wasp
but the idea of attacking the great creatures whose
sharp stings could annihilate any of them with a
touch the mere thought of taking the initiative was
appalling had their awe of burl been less complete
they would not have dreamed of following him

  the second act of the tragedy had begun the
bee had been slain by the wasp a carnivorous in-
sect normally but the wasp knew that sweet honey
was concealed in the half-filled crop of the bee had
the bee arrived safely at the hive the sweet and
sticky liquid would have been disgorged and added
to the hival store now though the bees journey
was ended and its flesh was to be crunched and de-
voured by the wasp the honey was the first object
of the pirates solicitude the dead insect was
rolled over upon its back and with eager haste the
slayer began to exploit the body

  burl and his men were creeping nearer but with
a gesture burl bade them halt for a moment the
wasps first move was to force the disgorgement of
the honey from the bees crop and with feverish
eagerness it pressed upon the limp body until the
shining sticky liquid appeared then the wasp
began in ghoulish ecstasy to lick up the sweet stuff
utterly absorbed in the feast

  many thousands of years before the absorption
of the then tiny insect had been noticed when
engaged in a similar feat and it was recorded in
books moldered into dust long ages before burls
birth that its rapture was so great that it had been
known to fall a victim to a second bandit while
engaged in the horrible banquet

  burl had never read the books but he had been
told that the pirate would continue its feast even
though seized by a greater enemy unable to tear it-
self from the nectar gathered by the creature it
had slain

  the tribesmen waited until the wasp had begun
its orgy licking up the toothsome stuff disgorged
by its dead prey it ate in gluttonous haste blind
to all sights deaf to all sounds able to think of
nothing conceive of nothing but the delights of the
liquid it was devouring

  at a signal the tribesmen darted forward they

wavered when near the slender-waisted gourmet
however and burl was the first to thrust his spear
with all his strength into the thinly armored body

  then the others took courage a short horny
spear penetrated the very vitals of the wasp a
club fell with terrific impact upon the slender
waist there was a crackling and the long spidery
limbs quivered and writhed while the tribesmen
fell back in fear but without cause

  burl struck again and the wasp fell into two
writhing halves helpless for harm the pink-
skinned men danced in triumph and the women and
children ventured near delighted

  only burl noticed that even as the wasp was
dying sundered and pierced with spears its slender
tongue licked out in one last ecstatic taste of the
nectar that had been its undoing

  burdened with the pollen-covered legs of the
giant bee and filled with the meat from choice por-
tions of the wasps muscular limbs the tribe re-
sumed its journey this time burl had men behind
him still timid still prone to flee at the slightest
alarm but infinitely more dependable than they had
been before

  they had attacked and slain a wasp whose sting
would have killed any of them they had done
battle under the leadership of burl whose spear
had struck the first blow henceforth they were
sharers in a mild way of his transcendent glory
and henceforth they were more like followers of a
mighty chief and less like spineless worshipers of
a demigod whose feats they were too timid to
emulate

  that night they hid among a group of giant puff-
balls feasting on thedoads of meat they had carried
thus far with them burl watched them now with-
out jealousy of their good spirits he and saya sat
a little apart happy to be near each other speaking
in low tones after a time darkness fell and the
tribefolk became shapeless bodies speaking in voices
that grew drowsy and were silent the black forms
of the toadstool heads and huge puffballs were but
darker against a dark sky

  the nightly rain began to fall drop by drop drop
by drop upon the damp and humid earth only
burl remained awake for a little while and his last
waking thought was of pride disinterested pride
he had the first reward of the ruler gratification
in the greatness of his people

  the red mushrooms had continued to show their
glistening heads though burl thought they were
less numerous than in the territory from which
the tribe had fled all along the route now to the
right now to the left they had burst and sent
their masses of deadly dust into the air

  many times the tribefolk had been forced to make
a detour to avoid a slowly spreading cloud of death-
dealing spores once or twice their escapes had been
narrow indeed but so far there had been no deaths

  burl had observed that the mushrooms normally
burst only in the daytime and for a while had
thought of causing his followers to do their journey-
ing in the night only the obvious disadvantages
of such a course-the difficulty of discovering food
and the prowling spiders that roamed in the dark-
ness-had prevented him the idea still stayed

amazing stories

with him however and two days after the fight
with the hunting wasp he put it in practise

  the tribe came to the top of a small rise in the
ground for an hour they had been marching and
counter-marching to avoid the suddenly appearing
clouds of dust once they had been nearly hemmed
in and only by mad sprinting did they escape when
three of the dull-red clouds seemed to flow together
closing three sides of a circle

  they came to the little hillock and halted be-
fore them stretched a plain all of four miles wide
colored a brownish brick-red by masses of mush-
rooms they had seen mushroom forests before
and knew of the dangers they presented but there
was none so deadly as the plain before them to
right and left it stretched as far as the eye could
see but far away on its farther edge burl caught
a glimpse of flowing water

  over the plain itself a dull-red haze seemed to
float it was nothing more or less than a cloud
of the deadly spores dispersed and indefinite con-
stantly replenished by the freshly bursting red
mushrooms

  while the people stood and watched a dozen thick
columns of dust rose into the air from scattered
points here and there upon the plain settling slowly
again but leaving behind them enough of their
finely divided substance to keep the thin red haze
over the whole plain in its original deadly state

  burl had seen single red mushrooms before and
even small thickets of two and three but here was
a plain of millions literally millions upon millions
of the malignant growths here was one fungoid
forest through whose aisles no monster beetles
stalked and above whose shadowed depths no
brightly colored butterflies fluttered in joyous
abandon there were no loud-voiced crickets sing-
ing in its hiding-places nor bodies of eagerly for-
aging ants searching inquisitively for bits of food
it was a forest of death still and silent quiet and
motionless save for the sullen columns of red dust
that ever and again shot upward from the torn and
ragged envelope of the bursting mushroom

  burl and his people watched in wonderment and
dismay but presently a high resolve came to burl
the mushrooms never burst at night and the deadly
dust from a subsided cloud was not deadly in the
morning as a matter of fact the rain that fell
every night made it no more than a sodden thin
film of reddish mud by daybreak mud which dried
and caked

  burl did not know what occurred but knew the
result at night or in early morning the danger
from the red mushrooms was slight therefore he
would lead his people through the very jaws of
death that night he would lead them through the
deadly aisles of this the forest of malignant
growths the place of lurking annihilation

  it was an act of desperation and the resolution
to carry it through left burl in a state of mind that
kept him from observing one thing that would have
ended all the struggles of his tribe at once per-
haps a quarter-mile from the edge of the red forest
three or four giant cabbages grew thrusting their
colossal leaves upward toward the sky

  and on the cabbages a dozen lazy slugs fed
leisurely ignoring completely the red haze that was

never far from them and sometimes covered them
burl saw them but the oddity of their immunity
from the effects of the red dust did not strike him
he was fighting to keep his resolution intact if
he had only realized the significance of what he saw
however-

  the slugs were covered with a thick soft fur the
tribespeople wore garments of that same material
the fur protected the slugs and could have made
the tribe immune to the deadly red dust if they had
only known the slugs breathed through a row of
tiny holes upon their backs as the mature insects
breathed through holes upon the bottom of their
abdomens and the soft fur formed a mat of felt
which arrested the fine particles of deadly dust while
allowing the pure air to pass through it formed
in effect a natural gas-mask which the tribesmen
should have adopted but which they did not dis-
cover or invent

  the remainder of that day they waited in a
curious mixture of resolve and fear the tribe was
rapidly reaching a point where it would follow burl
over a thousand-foot cliff and it needed some such
blind confidence to make them prepare to go through
the forest of the million deadly mushrooms

  the waiting was a strain but the actual journey
was a nightmare burl knew that the toadstools
did not burst of themselves during the night but
he knew that the beetle on which he had taken his
involuntary ride had crashed against one in the
darkness and that the fatal dust had poured out
he warned his people to be cautious and led them
down the slope of the hill through the blackness

  for hours they stumbled on in utter darkness
with the pungent acrid odor of the red growths con-
stantly in their nostrils they put out their hands
and touched the flabby damp stalks of the mon-
strous things they stumbled and staggered against
the leathery skins of the malignant fungoids

  death was all about them at no time during
all the dark hours of the night was there a moment
when they could not reach out their hands and touch
a fungus growth that might burst at their touch
and fill the air with poisonous dust so that all of
them would die in gasping choking agony

  and worst of all before half an hour was past
they had lost all sense of direction so that they
stumbled on blindly through the utter blackness
not knowing whether they were headed toward the
river that might be their salvation or were wan-
dering hopelessly deeper and deeper into the silent
depths of the forest of strangled things

  when day came again and the mushrooms sent
their columns of fatal dust into the air would they
gasp and fight for breath in the red haze that would
float like a tenuous cloud above the forest would
they breathe in flames of firelike torment and die
slowly or would the red dust be merciful and slay
them quickly

  they felt their way like blind folk devoid of
hope and curiously unafraid only their hearts were
like heavy cold weights in their breasts and they
shouldered aside the swollen sacs of the red mush-
rooms with a singular apathy as they followed burl
slowly through the midst of death

  many times in their journeying they knew that
dead creatures were near by-moths perhaps that
the red dust



had blundered into a distended growth which had
burst upon the impact and killed the thing that had
touched it

  no busy insect scavengers ventured into this
plain of silence to salvage the bodies however the
red haze preserved the sanctuary of malignance in-
violate during the day no creature might hope to
approach its red aisles and dust-carpeted clearings
and at night the slow-dropping rain fell only upon
the rounded heads of the mushrooms

  in all the space of the forest only the little band
of hopeless people plodding on behind burl in the
velvet blackness callously rubbed shoulders with
death in the form of the red and glistening mush-
rooms over all the dank expanse of the forest the
only sound was the dripping of the slow and sodden
rainfull that began at nightfall and lasted until day
came again

  the sky began to grow faintly gray as the sun
rose behind the banks of overhanging clouds burl
stopped short and uttered what was no more than
a groan he was in a little circular clearing and the
twisted monstrous forms of the deadly mushrooms
were all about there was not yet enough light
for colors to appear and the hideous almost obscene
shapes of the loathsome growths on every side
showed only as mocking leering silhouettes as of
malicious demons rejoicing at the coming doom of
the gray-faced huddled tribefolk

  burl stood still drooping in discouragement upon
his spear the feathery moths antennse bound upon
his forehead shadowed darkly against the graying
sky soon the mushrooms would begin to burst-

  then suddenly he lifted his head encourage-
ment and delight upon his features he had heard
the ripple of running water his followers looked
at him with dawning hope without a word burl
began to run and they followed him more slowly
his voice came back to them in a shout of delight

  then they too broke into a jog-trot in a
moment they had emerged from the thick tangle of
brownish-red stalks and were upon the banks of a
wide and swiftly running river the same river
whose gleam burl had caught the day before from
the farther side of the mushroom forest

  once before burl had floated down a river upon
a mushroom raft then his journey had been in-
voluntary and unlooked for he had been carried
far from his tribe and far from saya and his heart
had been filled with desolation

  now he viewed the swiftly running current with
eager delight he cast his eyes up and down the
bank here and there the river-bank rose in a low
bluff and thick shelf-growths stretched out above
the water

  burl was busy in an instant stabbing the hard
growths with his spear and striving to wrench them
free the tribesmen stared at him uncomprehend-
ing but at an order from him they did likewise

  soon a dozen thick masses of firm light fungus
lay upon the shore where it shelved gently into the
water burl began to explain what they were to do
but one or two of the men dared remonstrate say-
ing humbly that they were afraid to part from him
if they might embark upon the same thing with
him they would be safe but otherwise they were
afraid

  burl cast an apprehensive glance at the sky day
was coming rapidly on soon the red mushrooms
would begin to shoot their columns of deadly dust
into the air this was no time to pause and deliber-
ate then saya spoke softly

  burl listened and made a mighty sacrifice he
took his gorgeous velvet cloak from his shoulders-
it was made from the wing of a great moth-and
tore it into a dozen long irregular pieces tearing
it along the lines of the sinews that reinforced it
he planted his spear upright in the largest piece
of shelf-fungus and caused his followers to do like-
wise then fastened the strips of sinew and velvet
to his spear-shaft and ordered them to do the same
to the other spears

  in a matter of minutes the dozen tiny rafts were
bobbing on the water clustered about the larger
central bit then one by one the tribefolk took
their places and burl shoved off

  the agglomeration of cranky unseaworthy bits of
shelf-fungus moved slowly out from the shore until
the current caught it burl and saya sat upon the
central bit with the other trustful but somewhat
frightened pink-skinned people all about them and
as they began to move between the mushroom-lined
banks of the river and the mist of the night began
to lift from its surface far in the interior of the
forest of the red fungoids a column of sullen red
leaped into the air the first of the malignant
growths had cast its cargo of poisonous dust into
the still-humid atmosphere

  the conelike column spread out and grew thin
but even after it had sunk into the earth a reddish
taint remained in the air about the place where
it had been the deadly red haze that hung all
through the day over the red forest was in process
of formation

  but by that time the unstable fungus rafts were
far down the river bobbing and twirling in the
current with the wide-eyed people upon them gazing
in wonderment at the shores as they glided by the
red mushrooms grew lebs numerous upon the banks
other growths took their places molds and rusts
covered the ground as grass had done in ages past
mushrooms showed their creamy rounded heads
malformed things with swollen trunks and branches
in strange mockery of the trees they had superseded
made their appearance and once the tribesmen saw
the dark bulk of a hunting spider outlined for a
moment upon the bank

  all the long day they rode upon the current
while the insect life that had been absent in the
neighborhood of the forest of death made its ap-
pearance again bees once more droned overhead
and wasps and dragon-flies four-inch mosquitoes
made their appearance to be fought off by the tribe-
folk with lusty blows and glittering beetles and
shining flies whose bodies glittered with a metallic
luster buzzed and flew above the water

  huge butterflies once more were seen dancing
above the steaming festering earth in an apparent
ecstasy from the mere fact of existence and all the
thousand and one forms of insect life that flew and
crawled and swam and dived showed themselves
to the tribesmen on the raft

  water-beetles came lazily to the surface to snap
with sudden energy at mosquitoes busily laying


amazing stories

their eggs in the nearly stagnant water by the
river-banks burl pointed out to saya with some
excitement their silver breast-plates that shone as
they darted under the water again and the shell-
covered boats of a thousand caddis-worms floated in
the eddies and back-waters of the stream water-
boatmen and whirligigs-almost alone among in-
sects in not having shared in the general increase
of size-danced upon the oily waves

  the day wore on as the shores flowed by the
tribefolk ate of their burdens of mushroom and
meat and drank from the fresh water of the river
then when afternoon came the character of the
country about the stream changed the banks fell
away and the current slackened the shores be-
came indefinite and the river merged itself into a
swamp a vast swamp from which a continual mut-
tering came which the tribesmen heard for a long
time before they saw the swamp itself

  the water seemed to turn dark as black mud
took the place of the clay that had formed its bed
and slowly here and there then more frequently
floating green things that were stationary and did
not move with the current appeared they were
the leaves of water-lilies that had remained with
the giant cabbages and a very few other plants in
the midst of a fungoid world the green leaves
were twelve feet across and any one of them would
have floated the whole of burls tribe

  presently they grew numerous so that the channel
was made narrow and the mushroom rafts passed
between rows of the great leaves with here and
there a colossal waxen blossom in which three men
might have hidden and which exhaled an almost
over-powering fragrance into the air

  and the muttering that had been heard far away
grew in volume to an intermittent incredibly deep
bass roar it seemed to come from the banks on
either side and actually was the discordant croak-
ing of the giant frogs grown to eight feet in
length which lived and loved in the huge swamp
above which golden butterflies danced in ecstasy
and which the transcendently beautiful blossoms of
the water-lilies filled with fragrance

  the swamp was a place of riotous life the
green bodies of the colossal frogs-perchcd upon
the banks in strange immobility and only opening
their huge mouths to emit their thunderous croak-
ings-the green bodies of the frogs blended queerly
with the vivid color of the water-lily leaves dragon-
flies fluttered in their swift and angular flight above
the black and reeking mud greenbottles and blue-
bottles and a hundred other species of flies buzzed
busily in the misty air now and then falling prey
to the licking tongues of the frogs

  bees droned overhead in flight less preoccupied
and worried than elsewhere flitting from blossom to
blossom of the tremendous water-lilies loading their
crops with honey and the bristles of their legs
with yellow pollen

  everywhere over the mushroom-covered world
the air was never quite free from mist and the
steaming exhalations of the pools but here in the
swamps the atmosphere was so heavily laden with
moisture that the bodies of the tribefolk were
covered with glistening droplets while the wide
flat water-lily leaves glittered like platters of

jewels from the steam that had condensed upon
their upper surfaces

  the air was full of shining bodies and iridescent
wings myriads of tiny midges-no more than
three or four inches across their wings-danced
above the slow-flowing water and butterflies
of every imaginable shade and color from the
most delicate lavender to the most vivid carmine
danced and fluttered alighting upon the white
water-lilies to sip daintily of their nectar skimming
the surface of the water enamored of their brightly
tinted reflections

  and the pink-skinned tribesfolk floating through
this fairyland on their mushroom rafts gazed with
wide eyes at the beauty about them and drew in
great breaths of the intoxicating fragrance of the
great white flowers that floated like elfin boatsupon
the dark water

            chapter v
            out of bondage

the mist was heavy and thick and through it
the flying creatures darted upon their innum-
erable businesses visibly for an instant in all
their colorful beauty then melting slowly into in-
definiteness as they sped away the tribefolk on
the clustered rafts watched them as they darted
overhead and for hours the little squadron of fun-
goid vessels floated slowly through the central
channel of the marsh

  the river had split into innumerable currents
which meandered purposelessly through the glisten-
ing black mud of the swamp but after a long time
they seemed to reassemble and burl could see what
had caused the vast morass

  hills appeared on either side of the stream which
grew higher and steeper as if the foothills of a
mountain chain then burl turned and peered be-
fore him

  rising straight from the low hills a wall of high
mountains rose toward the sky and the low-hanging
clouds met their rugged flanks but half-way toward
the peaks to right and left the mountains melted
into the tenuous haze but ahead they were firm and
stalwart rising and losing their heights in the
cloud-banks

  they formed a rampart which might have
guarded the edge of the world and the river flowed
more and more rapidly in a deeper and narrower
current toward a cleft between two rugged giants
that promised to swallow the water and all that
might swim in its depths or float upon its surface

  tall steep hills rose from either side of the swift
current their sides covered with flaking molds of
an exotic shade of rose-pink mingled here and there
with lavender and purple rocks not hidden be-
neath a coating of fungus protruded their angular
heads from the hillsides the river valley became
a gorge and then little more than a canon with
beetling sides that frowned down upon the swift
current running beneath them

  the small flotilla passed beneath an overhanging
cliff and then shot out to where the cliff sides drew
apart and formed a deep amphitheater whose top
was hidden in the clouds
the red dust



  and across this open space on cables all of five
hundred feet long a banded spider had flung its
web it was a monster of its tribe its belly was
swollen to a diameter of no less than two yards and
its outstretched legs would have touched eight
points of a ten-yard circle

  it was hanging motionless in the center of the
colossal snare as the little group of tribefolk passed
underneath and they saw the broad bands of yellow
and black and silver upon its abdomen they
shivered as their little crafts were swept below

  then they eame to a little valley where yellow
sand bordered the river and there was a level space
of a hundred yards on either side before the steep
sides of the mountains began their rise here the
cluster of mushroom rafts were caught in a little
eddy and drawn out of the swiftly flowing current
soon there was a soft and yielding jar the rafts
had grounded

  led by burl the tribesmen waded ashore wonder-
ment and excitement in their hearts burl searched
all about with his eyes toadstools and mush-
rooms rusts and molds even giant puff-balls grew
in the little valley but of the deadly red mushrooms
he saw none

  a single bee was buzzing slowly over the tangled
thickets of fungoids and the loud voice of a cricket
came in a deafening burst of sound reechoed from
the hillsides but save for the far-flung web of the
banded spider a mile or more away there was no
sign of the deadly creatures that preyed upon men

  burl began to climb the hillside with his tribe-
folk after him for an hour they toiled upward
through confused masses of fungus of almost every
species twice they stopped to seize upon edible
fungi and break them into masses they could carry
and once they paused and made a wide detour
around a thicket from which there came a stealthy
rustling

  burl believed that the rustling was merely the
sound of a moth or butterfly emerging from its
chrysalis but was unwilling to take any chances
he and his people circled the mushroom thicket
and mounted higher

  and at last perhaps six or seven hundred feet
above the level of the river they came upon a little
plateau going back into a small pocket in the moun-
tainside here they found many of the edible
fungoids and no less than a dozen of the giant cab-
bages on whose broad leaves many furry grubs
were feeding steadily in placid contentment with
themselves and all the world

  a small stream bubbled up from a tiny basin
and ran swiftly across the plateau and there were
dense thickets of toadstools in which the tribesmen
might find secure hiding-places the tribe would
make itself a new home here

  that night they hid among inextricably tangled
masses of mushrooms an saw with amazement the
multitude of creatures that ventured forth in the
darkness all the valley and the plateau were il-
lumined by the shining beacons of huge but grace-
ful fire-flies who darted here and there in delight
and-apparently-in security

  upon the earth below also many tiny lights
glowed the larvee of the fireflies crawled slowly
but happily over the fungus-covered mountainside

and great glow-worms clambered upon the shining
tops of the toadstools and rested there twin broad
bands of bluish fire burning brightly within their
translucent bodies

  they were the females of the firefly race which
never attain to legs and wings but crawl always
upon the earth merely enlarged creatures in the
forms of their own larvse moths soared overhead
with mighty throbbing wing-beats and all the
world seemed a paradise through which no evil
creatures roamed in search of prey

  and a strange thing eame to pass soon after
darkness fell upon the earth and the steady drip-
drop of the rain began a musical tinkling sound
was heard which grew in volume and became a
deep-toned roar which reechoed and reverberated
from the opposite hillsides until it was like melodi-
ous and long-continued thunder for a long time
the people were puzzled and a little afraid but burl
took courage and investigated 

  he emerged from the concealing thicket and
peered cautiously about seeing nothing then he
dared move in the direction of the sound and the
gleam from a dozen fireflies showed him a sheet
of water pouring over a vertical cliff to the river
far below

  the rainfall gentle as it was when gathered
from all the broad expanse of the mountainside
made a river of its own which had scoured out a
bed and poured down each night to plunge in a
smother of spray and foam through six hundred
feet of empty space to the swiftly flowing river
in the center of the valley it was this sound that
had puzzled the tribefolk and this sound that
lulled them to sleep when burl at last came back
to allay their fears

  the next day they explored their new territory
with a boldness of which they would not have been
capable a month before they found a single great
trap-door in the earth sure sign of the burrow of
a monster spider and burl resolved that before
many days the spider would be dealt with he
told his tribesmen so and they nodded their heads
solemnly instead of shrinking back in terror as they
would have done not long since

  the tribe was rapidly becoming a group of men
capable of taking the aggressive they needed burls
rash leadership and for many generations they
would need bold leaders but they were infinitely
superior to the timid rabbit-like creatures they had
been they bore spears and they had used them
they had seen danger and had blindly followed
burl through the forest of strangled things instead
of fleeing weakly from the peril

  they wore soft yellow fur about their middles
taken from the bodies of giant slugs they had
slain they had eaten much meat and preferred
its succulent taste to the insipid savor of the mush-
rooms that had once been their steady diet they
knew the exhilaration of brave adventure-though
they had been forced into adventure by burl-and
they were far more worthy descendants of their
ancestors than those ancestors had known for many
thousand years

  the exploration of their new domain yielded
many wonders and a few advantages the tribe-
folk found that the nearest ant-city was miles away


amazing stories

and that the small insects would trouble them but
rarely the nightly rush of water down the slop-
ing sides of the mountain made it undesirable for
the site of an ant colony

  and best of all back in the little pocket in the
mountainside they found old and disused cells of
hunting wasps the walls of the pocket were made
of soft sandstone with alternate layers of clay and
the wasps had found digging easy

  there were a dozen or more burrows the shaft
of each some four feet in diameter and going back
into the cliff for nearly thirty feet where they
branched out into a number of cells each of the
cells had once held a grub which had grown fat
and large upon its hoard of paralyzed crickets and
then had broken away to the outer world to emerge
as a full-grown wasp

  now however the laboriously tunneled caverns
would furnish a hiding-place for the tribe of men
a far more secure hiding-place than the center of
the mushroom thickets and furthermore a hid-
ing-place which because more permanent would
gradually become a possession for which the men
would fight

  it is a curious thing that the advancement of a
people from a state of savagery and continual war-
fare to civilization and continual peace is not made
by the elimination of the causes of strife but by
the addition of new objects and ideals in defense of
which that same people will offer battle

  a single chrysalis was found securely anchored
to the underside of a rock-shelf and burl detached
it with great labor and carried it into one of the
burrows though the task was one that was almost
beyond his strength he desired the butterfly that
would emerge for his own use

  he preempted too a solitary burrow a little dis-
tant from the others and made preparations for an
event that was destined to make his plans wiser
and more far-reaching than before

  his followers were equally busy with their var-
ious burrows gathering stores of soft growth for
their couches and later-at burls suggestion-
even carrying within the dark caverns the radiant
heads of the luminous mushrooms to furnish il-
lumination the light would be dim and after
the mushroom had partly dried it would cease but
for a people utterly ignorant of fire it was far
from a bad plan

  burl was very happy for that time his people
looked upon him as a savior and obeyed his least
order without question he was growing to repose
some measure of trust in them too as men who
began to have some glimmerings of the new-found
courage that had come to him and which he had
striven hard to implant in their breasts

  the tribe had been a formless gathering of
people there were six or seven men and as many
women and naturally families had come into being
-sometimes after fierce and absurd fights among
the men-but the families were not the sharply
distinct agreements they would have been in a tribe
of higher development

  the marriage was but an agreement terminable
at any time and the men had but little of the feel-
ing of parenthood though the women had all the
fierce maternal instinct of the insects abdut them

  these burrows in which the tribefolk were mak-
ing their homes would put an end to the casual
nature of the marriage bonds they were homes
in the making-damp and humid burrows without
fire or heat but homes nevertheless the family
may come before the home in the development of
mankind but it invariably exists when the home
has been made

  the tribe had been upon the plateau for nearly
a week when burl found that stirrings and smug-
glings were going on within the huge cocoon he
had laid close beside the burrow he had chosen for
his own he cast aside all other work and waited
patiently for the thing he knew was about to hap-
pen he squatted on his haunches beside the huge
oblong cylinder his spear in his hand waiting
patiently from time to time he nibbled at a bit
of edible mushroom

  burl had acquired many new traits among which
a little foresight was most prominent but he had
never conquered the habit of feeling hungry at any
and every time that food was near at hand he
had to wait he had food therefore he ate

  the sound of scrapings came from the closed
cocoon caked upon its outer side with dirt and
mold the scraping and scratching continued and
presently a tiny hole showed which rapidly en-
larged tiny jaws and a dry glazed skin became
visible the skin looking as if it had been varnished
with many coats of brown shellac then a mal-
formed head forced its way through and stopped

  all motion ceased for a matter of perhaps half an
hour and then the strange blind head seemed to
become distended to be swelling a crack ap-
peared along its upper part which lengthened and
grew wide and then a second head appeared from
within the first

  this head was soft and downy and a slender
proboscis was coiled beneath its lower edge like
the trunk of one of the elephants that had been
extinct for many thousand years soft scales and
fine hairs alternated to cover it and two immense
many-faceted eyes gazed mildly at the world on
which it was looking for the first time the color
of the whole was purest milky-white

  slowly and painfully assisting itself by slender
colorless legs that seemed strangely feeble and
trembling a butterfly crawled from the cocoon its
wings were folded and lifeless without substance
or color but the body was a perfect white the
butterfly moved a little distance from its cocoon and
slowly unfurled its wings with the action life
seemed to be pumped into them from some hidden
spring in the insects body the slender antenna
spread out and wavered gently in the warm air
the wings were becoming broad expanses of snowy
velvet

  a trace of eagerness seemed to come into the
butterflys actions somewhere there in the valley
sweet food and joyous companions awaited it
fluttering above the fungoids of the hillsides
surely there was a mate with whom the joys of
love were to be shared surely upon those gigantic
patches of green half hidden in the haze there
would be laid tiny golden eggs that in time would
hatch into small fat grubs

  strength came to the butterflys limbs its
the red dust



wings were spread and closed with a new assurance
it spread them once more and raised them to make
the first flight of this new existence in a marvelous
world full of delights and adventures-burl struck
home with his spear

  the delicate limbs struggled in agony the wings
fluttered helplessly and in a little while the butter-
fly lay still upon the fungus-carpeted earth and
burl leaned over to strip away the great wings of
snow-white velvet to sever the long and slender
antennae and then to call his tribesmen and bid
them share in the food he had for them

  and there was a feast that afternoon the
tribesmen sat about the white carcass cracking
open the delicate limbs for the meat within them
and burl made sure that saya secured the choicest
bits the tribesmen were happy then one of the
children of the tribe stretched a hand aloft and
pointed up the mountainside

  coming slowly down the slanting earth was a
long narrow file of living animals for a time the
file seemed to be but one creature but burls keen
eyes soon saw that there were many they were
caterpillars each one perhaps ten feet long each
with a tiny black head armed with sharp jaws and
with dull-red fur upon their backs the rear of
the procession was lost in the mist of the low-
hanging cloud-banks that covered the mountainside
some two thousand feet above the plateau but the
foremost was no more than three hundred yards
away

  slowly and solemnly the procession came on the
black head of the second touching the rear of the
first and the head of the third touching the rear
of the second in faultless alinement without in-
tervals they moved steadily down the slanting side
of the mountain

  save the first they seemed absorbed in maintain-
ing their perfect formation but the leader con-
stantly rose upon his hinder half and waved the
fore part of his body in the air first to the right
and then to the left as if searching out the path
he would follow

  the tribefolk watched in amazement mingled with
terror only burl was calm he had never seen
a slug that meant danger to man and he reasoned
that these were at any rate moving slowly so that
they could be distanced by the fleeter-footed human
beings but he also meant to be cautious

  the slow march kept on the rear of the proces-
sion of caterpillars emerged from the cloud-bank
and burl saw that a shining white line was left
behind them no less than eighty great caterpillars
clad in white and dingy red were solemnly moving
down the mountainside leaving a path of shining
silk behind them head to tail in single file they
had no eyes or ears for anything but their proces-
sion

  the leader reached the plateau and turned he
came to the cluster of giant cabbages and ignored
them he came to a thicket of mushrooms and
passed through it followed by his devoted band
then he came to an open space where the earth was
soft and sandy where sandstone had weathered and
made a great heap of easily moved earth

  the leading caterpillar halted and began to bur-
row experimentally in the ground the result

pleased him and some signal seemed to pass along
the eight-hundred-foot line of creatures the
leader began to dig with feet and jaws working
furiously to cover himself completely with the soft
earth those immediately behind him abandoned
their formation and pressed forward in haste
those still farther back moved more hurriedly

  all when they reached the spot selected by the
leader abandoned any attempt to keep to their
line and hastened to find an unoccupied spot in
the open space in which to bury themselves

  for perhaps half an hour the clearing was the
scene of intense activity incredible activity huge
ten-foot bodies burrowed desperately in the whitish
fearth digging frantically to cover themselves

  after the half-hour however the last of the
caterpillars had vanished only an occasional
movement of the earth from the struggle of a
buried creature to bury itself still deeper and the
freshly turned surface showed that beneath the
clearing on the plateau eighty great slugs were
preparing themselves for the sleep of metamor-
phosis the piled-up earth and the broad white
band of silk leading back up the hillside until it
became lost in the clouds alone remained to tell of
the visitation

  the tribesmen had watched in amazement they
had never seen these creatures before but they
knew of course why they had entombed themselves
had they known what the scientists of thirty thou-
sand years before had written in weighty and dull
books they would have deduced from the appear-
ance of the processionary caterpillars-or pine-
caterpillars-that somewhere above the banks of
clouds there were growing trees and sunlight that
a moon shone down and stars twinkled from the
blue vault of a cloudless sky

  but the tribesmen did not know they only
knew that there beneath the soft earth was a
mighty store of food for them when they cared
to dig for it that their provisions for many months
were secure and that burl their leader was a great
and mighty man for having led them to this land of
safety and plenty

  burl read their emotions in their eyes but better
than their amazement and wonderment was a glance
that had nothing whatever to do with his leadership
of the tribe and then burl rose and took the two
snowy-white velvet cloaks from the wings of the
white butterfly one of them he flung about his
own shoulders and the other he flung about saya
and then those two stood up before the wide-eyed
tribesmen and burl spoke

  this is my mate and my food is her food and
her wrath i my wrath my burrow is her burrow
and her sorrow my sorrow

  men whom i have led to this land of plenty
hear me as ye obey my words see to it that the
words of saya are obeyed likewise for my spear
will loose the life from any man who angers her
know that as i am great beyond all other men so
saya is great beyond all other women for i say
it and it is so

and he drew saya toward him trembling slightly
and put his arm about her waist before all the tribe
and the tribesmen muttered in acquiescent whispers

prologue

n the third day of last august the pub-
lic was astounded by a story -which
appeared in every newspaper in the
country extra editions of even the
most staid and conservative papers ap-
peared on the streets shortly after noon and in
screaming headlines announced

 hartwell building disappears
 twenty story structure vanishes
 in broad daylight and reappears
 marvelous and inexplicable illu-
 sion witnessed by crowds believed
 to be a demonstration bysome mas-
 ter hypnotist seeking publicity

  it is not necessary to quote the stories that oc-
cupied entire pages of the press for while all agreed
in the main essentials no two were the same and
all contained glaring errors and discrepancies
moreover the events must still be fresh in the
minds of my readers suffice to say that each and
every account stated that the new hartwell build-
ing in process of construction on nineteenth street
had suddenly vanished from sight during the
noon hour that hundreds of citizens had packed
the thoroughfare that the police and fire depart-
ments had been called out and that for a space of
several minutes only a vacant lot and an immense
excavation had been visible where the building had
stood then while the crowd looked on the struc-
ture had reappeared as suddenly and mysteriously
as it had vanished

  the story was so utterly incredible that at first
many persons thought it
merely a canard or some
advertising or publicity
scheme but as during
the following days the
press was filled with ac-
counts of the phenomenon
as related by eyewit-
nesses and as the police
and fire department offi-
cials confirmed the re-
ports and there could be
no question regarding the
authenticity of the story
innumerable theories and
explanations were sug-
gested and so for days
the crowds thronged the
streets near the hartwell
building and stood gaz-
ing expectantly in the hopes that it might repeat its
mysterious behavior

  the concensus of opinion was that the astounding
occurrence had been brought about by some hypnot-
ist or fakir who as the east indian magicians are
supposed to do had hypnotised the onlookers and
that the disappearance of the building had been
wholly an illusion no doubt said the times
the public will soon be informed that signor so-
and-so the worlds greatest hypnotist and illusion-
ist will appear at a certain theatre with a further
announcement of the fact that the signor deluded

hundreds of persons and by his mesmeric powers
caused them to believe that a twenty-story build-
ing could vanish into thin air

  but as time went on and no one came forward to
claim the doubtful honor of being able to accomplish
such a feat by hypnotism or otherwise the mystery
deepened and every conceivable theory-both na-
tural and supernatural was advanced to explain the
wholly unaccountable phenomenon

  up tu the present time the truth has never been
known and only two men in the world are aware of
the actual facts and the real solution of the mystery
one of these is doctor lemuel unsinn professor
of physics at stanforth university and my life-
time friend and college chum the other is myself
as the time has now passed when any harm can
come from giving the true story to the world and
as the explanation is even more incredible and re-
markable than any of the imaginary solutions put
forth we have agreed that the public should bo
made acquainted with the facts indeed the
authentic story would have been published some
months ago had it not been essential to make cer-
tain arrangements to safeguard the secret and
whose making required much more time than had
been anticipated

  in order to make clear just how the astounding
occurrence took place and to enable my readers to
thoroughly understand my true if incredible story
it will be necessary to begin at the beginning and to
recount every detail of the events which led to the
final results to many readers much of this matter
will no doubt prove rather dry and if i were writ-
ing fiction i would omit all those portions of the
tale which deal with the
scientific side and the pre-
liminaries but both dr
unsinn and myself feel
that to omit such matters
would be a great mistake
and that as the story is
of as much interest and
importance to the scienti-
fic world as to the layman
nothing should be left un-
told moreover we feel
that unless such matters
were included my story
would be considered as
purely fictitious and at
any rate the reader is at
liberty to skip such por-
tions of my narrative as
the appreciative reader
may find to be lacking in real and genuine interest

chapter i

doctor unsinn propounds some theories

it really began when i was visiting my old friend
and college chum dr lemuel unsinn soonl
after his return from an international confer
ence of scientists

  he had been telling me of the various new dis-
coveries which had been announced by his fellows
and mentioned certain phenomena of light ray

 tf you have read beyond the pole by a hyatt ferrill
 you will no doubt be interested in the present story by
 the same author we have no hesitancy in recommending
 it and at the same time stating that sue believe it is one of
 the greatest stories on man-made invisibility which has
 ever appeared in these latter days of science it would be
 rash to say that invisibility can not be produced already
 dr jules stean of alsace-lorraine has produced partial
 invisibility by injecting certain liquids into animal tissue
 which make the animal practically transparent when it is
 viewed in a certain light the full details of his experi-
 ments were published in the february  issue of
 science and invention no experiments have been
 made on human beings as yet but there is no question that
 sooner or later the problem of invisibility will be solved
 just what might happen when the secret is found is well
 related by the author of this story which you will read not
 only with great interest but with much amusement as well


amazing stories

which hitherto unseen had now been brought with-
in the scope of human vision although i could
not as a layman see the importance of the dis-
covery my friend was most enthusiastic about the
matter and among other statements declared that
it might yet be possible to render objects invisible

  i laughed that is utterly impossible i de-
clared

  nothing within the realms of science is impos-
sible he retorted

  perhaps not i admitted but there are many
things which are so highly improbable that to all in-
tents and purposes they are beyond possibility or
reason

  utter nonsense he ejaculated ignorance
lack of imagination pig-headed conservatism
every advance made by science has been declared
improbable or impossible or both until its feasibil-
ity has been proven railways steamships the
telegraph and telephone radio airplanes-all have
been laughed at and declared impossibilities until
they became actualities science he went on as-
suming his lecture-room manner and looking at me
over the rims of his glasses science does not ac-
knowledge the existence of the words impossible and
improbable what seems a mere dream today may
become an every-day affair tomorrow the

scientist-

  oh all right i laughed cut out the lecture
granting that nothing is beyond science as rep-
resented by my old friend lemuel unsinn how
do you propose going about it

  i presume you refer to the matter of rendering
visible objects invisible he smiled leaning back in
his chair and placing the tips of his fingers to-
gether

  i nodded

  hmm i hardly care to divulge all my ideas even
to such an old friend as yourself he chuckled
but i am willing to suggest lines along which such
investigations might be conducted you state that
it is preposterous to consider making visible solid
matter invisible is it any more preposterous than
to-make inasdible sounds audible invisible things
visible or audible sounds inaudible

  i shook my head no id say ones as impos-
sible as the other

  lemuel grinned which shows your monu-
mental ignorance he exclaimed my dear boy
he continued those feats are all accomplished facts
and are so familiar to you that you do not realize
they exist the inaudible waves transmitted by
radio are rendered audible in the receiving set the
audible waves which enter the microphone of the
transmitting station are sent inaudibly through the
ether and heat which is invisible under certain
conditions is plainly visible under other conditions
which occur every day

  yes i granted rather grudgingly ill admit
the matter of sounds but id like to know when and
how heat can be seen that is unless you refer
to the wavy effect seen above a pavement or sand
on a hot day

  no there you have air usually invisible rend-
ered visible by its motion replied my friend but
you have undoubtedly seen red-hot or white-hot

metal and there you have heat made visible
heat sound light and probably scent also are all
caused by vibratory waves waves varying in
length from the shortest x-rays and gamma rays to
the longest recorded waves waves varying from
less than a billionth part of a meter to over one-
hundred-and-fifty thousand meters in length un-
fortunately however the human system is not
designed or attuned to register or recognize more
than an infinitely small proportion of these vi-
bratory waves our eyes can only record those
which range between violet and red but our
nerves and ears can detect others which are
invisible for example there are the heat waves
which are too long for as to see but if by
heating an object we decrease the length of
the waves until they come within the limits of our
vision we see the heat waves as red and by still
further heating the object the hotter waves ap-
pear to us as violet white or yellow white being
as you know merely a mixture or combination of
the various light waves in other words my dear
boy our eyes our nerves our ears and in all prob-
ability our noses as well are much like radio re-
ceiving sets we can tune in waves of light sound
heat and scent within certain limits and like radio
receiving sets we often fail to tune out interfer-
ences many sounds are far too high or too low
for the human ear to detect just as many light
waves are too short or too long for us to see

  all extremely interesting and educational i
said but what bearing does all this have on the
matter under discussion-the rendering of various
objects-any object i believe you said-invisible
let me reply by asking you a question smiled
my friend why are objects-human beings
houses trees anything we see-visible merely
because they reflect light he continued without
waiting for my answer very well then we
see an object because it reflects light we see
colors on that object because it has properties which
cause it to absorb certain light rays and to reflect
others-if red to us it absorbs the violet indigo
blue green yellow and orange rays if it
appears white it reflects all the rays if black it
absorbs them in other words we do not actually
see the object at all we merely see the light waves
reflected from the object and if means can be
found to cause the object to absorb the light rays-
youd have a black object instead of a colored
one i laughed

  exactly agreed my friend quite unperturbed
provided the absorption was imperfect he added
but he continued if the means were such as to
cause perfect absorption in other words to allow
the light waves to pass through the object then it
would become invisible just as clear glass is in-
visible even though glass reflects certain waves of
light which cannot be detected by the human eye
i chuckled the idea of transforming opaque ob-
jects to transparent objects seemed highly amusing
go to it i laughed why not begin with the
ladies their clothes are pretty nearly trans-
parent now

  if youre trying to be facetious theres no use
the man who could vanish



in my attempting to explain my ideas and theories
commented dr unsinn in an injured tone

  i wasnt laughing at your theories i assured
him and im really interested even if i dont see
what youre getting at

  if your sense of logic and your knowledge of
science were as highly developed as your sense of
humor and your knowledge of womens garments
you might more readily grasp what i am getting at
as you put it he said dryly however he con-
tinued i had no intention of conveying the idea
that i believed visible objects could be rendered
invisible by such means but if by altering the
frequency or lengths of light waves reflected from
an object we could render such waves too short
or too long for the human eye to register then the
object would become wholly invisible

  by this time i was really interested my friends
arguments were i knew sound if the frequency
of one form of vibratory wave could be altered if
an oscillating wave could be changed to a direct
wave or vice versa if the inaudible radio waves
could be made audible by the simplest of instru-
ments was there any scientific reason why light
waves ordinarily visible might not be made in-
visible

  and the man who succeeds in accomplishing such
a feat will control the world declared dr unsinn
interrupting my thoughts imagine it think
for a moment what it would mean  he could com-
mand anything everything he could amass mil-
lions billions if he wished he could control the
destinies of nations no treaties no plots no
business deals could be secret he could go any-
where unknown unsuspected unseen why he
exclaimed as he sprang from his chair and began
excitedly pacing the room think what it would
mean to a nation armies battleships invisible
and-

  think what it would mean to the crooks i
broke in better not delve too far old man you
might succeed and your secret might leak out
well i must be going good luck to you in your
experiments and-with a laugh lets hope
that the next time i see you i shant see you at all

chapter ii

an amazing demonstration

a few days after the foregoing conversation
with my old friend doctor unsinn import-
ant business unexpectedly called me to
south america

  although his words often occurred to me on the
long journey south yet i gave them little serious
consideration for i knew that lemuel like so many
scientific men was prone to theorize and to argue
most plausibly and convincingly in support of some
theory even if he had no real faith in it and amid
new scenes and new friends and with matters of
much more pressing importance to occupy my at-
tention all thoughts of dr unsinns weird ideas
were completely driven from my mind

  not until several months later when i was home-
ward bound did i again think of our last con-

versation i had to be sure dropped him a post-
card now and then but i had received no reply and
did not expect any lemuel was never one to write
and he considered it a waste of time to carry on a
purposeless correspondence with anyone although
he would fill page after page with facts figures and
theories in letters to other scientists now how-
ever as i recalled our conversation i found myself
wondering if he had actually attempted to carry his
theory to a test of course the idea was ridiculously
bizarre and unattainable and yet i felt sure that dr
unsinn had actually been in earnest and really be-
lieved that it vas scientifically possible to produce
invisibility in solid matter

  and the more i mentally reviewed his words and
analyzed his statements the more i felt that he
might be right at least theoretically after all was
such a feat any more remarkable than the fact
that the ships wireless operator was talking and
listening to people thousands of miles distant and
separated from our ship by countless leagues of sea
and land and yet the idea of any material object
being invisible seemed so far-fetched and super-
natural that i could not bring myself to believe that
lemuel would ever attempt to experiment along
such lines nevertheless i had thought so much on
the subject that at the first opportunity after my
arrival and reaching my apartment i called dr
unsinn by phone and after the usual greetings
asked how he was succeeding in his black art per-
haps he felt slightly piqued at my tone or my words
but instantly there was a change in his voice and
he replied rather shortly that it was evident that
i had not improved in my attitude towards science
but that as an old chum and friend he would be
glad to have me call whenever i found it convenient

  just why my curiosity had been aroused i can-
not say but curious i was nevertheless and within
the hour i was at lemuels door his filipino ser-
vant miguel answered the bell and greeted me with
a welcoming grin on his usually emotionless face

  the senor doctor is in the laboratory he an-
nounced as i entered he say you will please to
await him in the library he will arrive in one little
moment

  i was somewhat surprised for as a rule i was
welcome to enter lemuels holy of holies whenever
i called and never before had i been asked to await
his pleasure like a perfect stranger but no doubt i
thought he was busy on some delicate experiment
and did not wish to be interrupted entering the
library i turned to a table littered with magazines
and scientific reports and rather idly glanced
through them a sound like the creaking of a foot-
step on a loose board caused me to turn but the
door was open the hallway was in plain view aiid
no one was in sight once more i resumed my per-
usal of the periodicals and was becoming a bit in-
terested in an article i ran across when i was
startled by a low chuckle instantly i wheeled
about surprised that i had not heard my friends
approach only to find the room empty then as i
stood rather foolishly gaping i fear and puzzled
to understand how my ears had deceived me i fair-
ly jumped out of the obviously empty room came
dr unsinns unmistakable voice


amazing stories

  sorry to have kept you waiting it said youre
looking exceedingly well after your trip

  for an instant a strange creepy sensation swept
over me then i realized that this must be one of
my friends practical jokes no doubt he had in-
stalled some sort of telephone or loud speaker ar-
rangement in the apartment and was testing it out
on me

  as nearly as i could judge the words had come
from the farther corner of the room where there
was a large deeply-upholstered chair taking a
step nearer i peered into the corner trying to dis-
cover the hidden instrument and as i gazed at the
chair i rubbed my eyes and wondered if i were tak-
ing leave of my senses

  slightly above the back of the chair and sus-
pended in mid-air were a pair of spectacles on the
left side and a short distance below was a round
metal disc and also seemingly floating in the at-
mosphere were a number of buttons a gold watch
and chain two small ornamental silver buckles
some cuff links and a large signet ring just below
these and suspended a few inches above the chair
seat were several silver coins while just above the
floor four rows of small metal rings hung without
any support whatsoever

  even while i gazed dumbfounded utterly at a
loss to account for this strange hallucination that
ghostly chuckle again issued from the corner and
lsaw the various objects sway the coins shift their
position and the ring move towards the spectacles
which seemed to follow it as though drawn by a
magnet as it again descended to its former position
then once again the uncanny voice spoke

  my dear boy your expression is most remark-
able it said you really should see yourself but
it is most gratifying to me for it proves my test is
a success if i remember correctly you remarked
when i last saw you that you hoped the next time
you saw me you would not see me at all well your
wish is granted you are gazing-or rather i might
say gaping at me without seeing me but i do
not wonder you are amazed and also incredulous-
dont deny it i can see you think this some hoax
however-

  i had been gazing gaping jaw dropped mouth
open eyes fairly popping as the voice spoke and
fascinated i saw the watch the discs and the money
slowly rise upward and come towards me the next
instant i fairly shrieked and leaped back an un-
seen ghostly hand had gripped my shoulder a
hearty peal of laughter rang through the apartment
as shaken almost terror stricken i shrank back
against the old-fashioned mantel

  yes my experiment is a complete success an-
nounced the disembodied voice but there is no need
to carry the test further you see my black art as
you call it has worked and the impossible has been
made possible but i feel you will be more at ease
if i am visible no doubt it will take time to ac-
custom yourself to the phenomenon

  hardly had the last word been issued when the
watch the discs and the coins vanished and dr
unsinn stood before me as solid as substantial
and as natural as ever

  i collapsed it was almost as great a shock to my

nerves to see my friend materialize from the air as
it had been to hear his voice to feel his grip when
he had been invisible yes invisible for no longer
could i doubt that the scientist had succeeded in
making the impossible possible

  i think i have answered your query of this
morning exclaimed dr unsinn triumphantly as
he seated himself in his favorite chair i felt
quite sure of mysuccess even before you arrived
he continued i could not be sure however for
strangely enough-and quite surprising and as yet
somewhat inexplicable to me i can see myself in a
mirror even when invisible to others but i tried
it to a slight extent on miguel although i dared
not put the fellow to a thorough test-too super-
stitious and excitable you know might have died
of fright or have bolted if i had spoken or if he
had noticed anything such as my watch or buttons
ah you noticed such objects did you not

  by this time i had regained a bit of my compos-
ure and enough breath to speak ill say i did i
replied but why allow such objects to remain
visible

  hmm that is my great difficulty replied lem-
uel regretfully it is obvious that the same treat-
ment will not serve for all objects i have learned
how to render any organic substance invisible but
as yet i have not discovered how to accomplish the
result with inorganic matter my body my cloth-
ing my shoes yes even objects of wood are by my
method easily rendered invisible but metals-my
watch my suspender buttons the coins in my pock-
et and the eyelets for my shoe strings resist so
far all my efforts

  but how i interrupted do you do it

  dr unsinn smiled knowingly that is a secret
i do not care to divulge he replied but he
went on in a general way it is along the lines i
suggested during our last conversation on the sub-
ject-by altering the frequency of light waves so
that they become invisible to the human eye as
you my friend are deplorably ignorant of higher
physics i may perhaps better explain the process
by comparing it with certain phenomena of radio
with which you may be more or less familiar do
you know the meaning of the term heterodyne

  i nodded

  good continued lemuel then i can state
that by my process i send out certain vibratory
waves from my apparatus and these striking the
light rays reflect them back with a frequency
which renders them invisible in other words the
light rays which would normally strike a solid
object and being reflected therefrom would cause
that object to become visible are prevented from
striking that object by my method but strike an
armor of an envelope of outgoing vibratory waves
is that clear

  perfectly i lied blithely not in the least un-
derstanding the scientific side of the explanation
but deeply interested nevertheless but i asked
i dont understand why some objects remain vis-
ible while others vanish and i didnt notice any ap-
paratus for bringing on your astounding invisi-
bility

  i do not myself fully understand why organic
the man who could vanish



odjects should respond to my treatment and in-
organic objects should resist it admitted my
friend but it is probably due to the fact that in-
organic materials do not throw off my vibratory
waves at the same frequency as organic materials
but i will solve the problem i must solve it as
for your other query the appliance which i em-
ploy is very compact and becomes invisible together
with myself at first the apparatus was cumber-
some and clumsy but i have now perfected it and
have it so readily and perfectly under control that
it is even more simple than tuning-in on a small
radio receiving set indeed the results may be
brought about slowly and gradually as i will de-
monstrate

  as dr unsinn stood before me a strange incred-
ibly weird change came over him a thin haze
seemed to envelop his body and as i stared fascin-
ated the haze seemed slowly to clear away and to
my indescribable amazement i saw the curtained
doorway leading into the room whose portiere and
parts of whose frame appeared through my friends
body and head if ever there was a ghost lemuel
was one and then as if snuffed out lemuel com-
pletely vanished and only his spectacles the fra-
ternity button on his lapel his watch and chain his
cuff-links his belt and arm-garter buckles his ring
watch and chain and the other metallic objects of
his apparel remained to assure my reeling senses
that dr unsinn still stood before me

  i cannot begin to describe the sensation of thus
seeing my companion vanish before my eyes but it
was nothing compared to the creepy uncanny
nerve-racking sensation which followed as lemuels
characteristic chuckle issued from the transparent
air and he again spoke

  for heavens sake i cried dont do that ill
have a nervous collapse if that disembodied voice
of yours keeps on

  the voice laughed but the next instant my friend
was before me as substantial as ever

  youll get accustomed to the sensation he de-
clared but-

  never i broke in no normal person could
ever get accustomed to seeing a man vanish be-
fore his eyes or to hearing a voice talking from thin
air

  hmm i had rather expected something of this
sort admitted lemuel no doubt it is a bit un-
nerving but you must accustom yourself to the
phenomenon now if you will follow my directions
and using a duplicate instrument will render your-
self invisible-

  i will not i declared i have no desire to try
the experiment but even if i did i fail to see how
that would render your disappearance any less un-
canny

  it is my belief replied dr unsinn that if
you were treated by my waves i would still be vis-
ible to you and you to me i am as i informed you
quite visible to myself when i look in a mirror
this i assume is due to some effect which my ap-
paratus exercises upon the optic nerves thus en-
abling the eye to register the light-waves even
when their frequency is accelerated i am most

anxious to test the matter and you will confer a
great favor by acceding to my wishes

  not a bit pf it i declared you can monkey
with such things all you wish but im perfectly
satisfied to remain visible

  lemuel shook his head sadly youre a conserv-
ative imbecile he informed me i had counted
on your accompanying me as i go about in order
to note the effect upon the public and it would be
most desirable that you should also be invisible
look here i said i know you can vanish i
know its all a perfectly natural feat but its too
devilishly creepy and uncanny for my nerves and
if youre going to keep on being snuffed out and
talking from an invisible mouth ill leave you to
your own devices and not come near your place

  dr unsinn grinned you forget that you
couldnt prevent me from coming to see you he
reminded me i could enter your apartment un-
seen and unsuspected i might be seated on one of
your chairs or lying on a couch in the same room
with you and youd never suspect it

  if i didnt see your confounded watch and other
metallic articles i assented but with all your
darned scientific ardor i know youre not one to
butt-in where youre not wanted-even for the sake
of an experiment

  but all joking aside said my friend i am
sorry that your nerves should be upset by my de-
monstration however there is i think a means of
overcoming all your objections and yet helping me
with my most valuable and interesting experiments
i have in fact devised a little instrument which
will enable you to see me even when i am invisible
to others

  rising he opened a cabinet and turning handed
me a small rectangular box slightly larger than 
cigarette case to one end of the box a fine braidec
cord was attached with the other end terminating
in a pair of metal-rimmed slightly tinted eye-
glasses

  if you will place the detector case in your pocket
and adjust the glasses on your nose we will try an
interesting test announced dr unsinn

  look here i said is this some darned trick to
make me invisible

  i assure you it is not he declared but if i
am not vastly mistaken it will prevent me from be-
coming invisible to you

  somewhat hesitatingly and without the least
faith in the apparently simple device i slipped the
case in my breast pocket and placed the glasses on
my nose as far as i could see all objects remained
the same as before though everything including
lemuels face took on a peculiar pinkish tint due
i supposed to the color of the glasses

  i presume you have no difficulty in seeing the
various objects about the room including myself
said my friend

  not a bit i assured him

  then if you will kindly press the lever on the
case we will proceed

  examining the case i noticed a small lever or
arm which fitted snuggly into a small groove on one
edge of the affair


amazing stories

  lift the lever and move it forward-toward the
cord as far as it will go said my friend

  a slight click followed by an almost inaudible
whistling sound issued from the case as i obeyed
his instructions but as far as i could see theue
were no other results lemuel still sat in his chair
his legs crossed his elbows on the chair-arms the
tips of his fingers together and his mild blue eyes
looking over the tops of his glasses

  the confounded contraptions a dud i ex-
claimed everythings just the same

precisely my friend agreed but just re-
move the glasses from your eyes for a moment
as i complied with his request i uttered a cry of
utter amazement dr unsinn was absolutely in-
visible

  now replace the glasses said his disembodied
voice

  hardly knowing what to expect absolutely
dumbfounded i again placed the glasses before my
eyes and there sat my friend as before i could not
believe it i could not believe that this rnow you
see him and now you dont effect was produced by
the glasses no i felt sure it was a trick on lem-
uels part he must manage to vanish and to re-
appear coincidently with my donning or removing
the lenses but he assured me-quite heatedly and
convincingly-that he had remained in the invis-
ible state throughout fihe experiment and more-
over he was so evidently highly elated at the suc-
cess of his invention that at last i was forced to
believe that the magic glasses actually rendered the
invisible visible but my brain was now in a com-
plete chaos my friends power to render himself
invisible the fact that certain objects remained
visible the effect of the glasses rendering him vis-
ible to me while still invisible to ordinary eyes
were all unquestionable facts but they were so
weird uncanny and downright supernatural that
i felt as if in a confused preposterous dream and
i half expected to wake up at any moment

  its splendid exclaimed lemuel interrupting
my chaotic thoughts even if i cannot overcome
your absurd and unreasonable objections to becom-
ing invisible it now matters little

  look here i ejaculated just what are you
planning to do are you going out to amass the
millions you spoke of to control the world ill ad-
mit theres no reason why you should not succeed-
possessing your secret nothing is impossible of at-
tainment but if you plan taking me along youre
mistaken im not invisible and i dont intend to
be and i can easily foresee where id be the goat
for any confounded ghostly acts you perpetrated
dr unsinn laughed heartily my dear boy he
cried controlling his merriment you appear to
forget that i am a scientist and a respected member
of the community with a reputation to uphold i
have not the least desire nor intention to overstep
the bounds of honesty law or proper behavior even
if invisible if i were so minded i could as you
know help myself to the worlds treasures could
control the destinies of nations could in fact place
myself beyond the power of man or the law but
my sole idea is to use my discovery for the benefit
pf mankind to perfect it and give it to the world as

so many great discoveries have been given we men
of science are never materialists-

  youre an idiot i exclaimed benefit of man-
kind  give it to the world why if you gave your
discovery to the world-if you gave the secret to
anyone-it would be a curse to mankind youd be
destroying law and order and the world

  hmm perhaps there is something in that ad-
mitted lemuel regretfully but at any rate i must
discover how to treat inorganic substances before
any very extensive experiments can be conducted
it would hardly do for a crowd to see a watch and
buttons wandering about without visible attach-
ment or reason

  you might leave your watch behind and use
bone or fibre buttons i suggested

  but my dear man objected my friend unless
i can render all substances invisible i shall feel that
my efforts have been in vain

  and i sincerely hope you fail i informed him
i dont see what good it will do for the rest of the
world and if it leaks out heaven help us
ftjustwhat thousands of conservative hide-bound
persons have said of every great discovery of the
past exclaimed lemuel as i rose to take my leave

chapter iii

dr unsinn perfects his invention

as i walked towards my apartment my mind
was of course filled with thoughts of my
friends amazing discovery and among
other matters it came to me as a rather curious
and amusing fact that dr unsinn who had dwelt
so enthusiastically upon the material possibilities
of invisibility when he first discussed the matter
was now far more interested in proving his
scientific theories than in profiting by his discovery
it was typical of the man and is i believe of most
scientists but a more disturbing thought was that
my friend was deplorably absent-minded-a common
trait of scientists also especially when preoccupied
with some experiment and being so inherently
honest and frank himself he was too prone to as-
sume that his fellow-beings were the same in this
lay so i feared a very grave danger i remem-
bered occasions in the past when suddenly side-
tracked by some new lead he had completely for-
gotten formulae or calculations which had enabled
him to succeed in some experiment and had never
been able to duplicate the results might he not in
endeavoring to perfect some feature of his own dis-
covery forget some important detail and find him-
self unable to restore himself to visible form it
was in fact this chance that had caused me to refuse
to test his device upon myself i could see where it
might be most entertaining and advantageous to
become invisible temporarily but i had no desire
to remain in that condition indefinitely and any
failure of lemuels device any miscalculation any
accident or any sudden illness on his part might
leave me forever incapable of resuming my visible
form the risk to be sure might be small but it
was far too great for me to take and finally there
was the chance that dr unsinn might in his ardor
and enthusiasm divulge his secret unquestion-
the man who could vanish



ably he would wish to announce his discovery to his
fellow scientists if he did so some one would make
the fact public and then as i had said to lemuel
heaven help mankind my head swam and i fairly
trembled at thought of what would occur should my
friends secret fall into the hands of unprincipled
men law society governments would be power-
less possessing the power to become invisible
crooks could defy the world they could loot banks
state treasuries mints and all other sources of
hoarded millions unseen unhampered and leaving
no traces of their identity murder robbery rapine
any and all crimes could be committed without fear
of detection or punishment even if caught una-
wares and thrown into prison an invisible man could
walk out without being seen no walls could hold
him no court try him no punishment be dealt him
and even if the secret were known to all it would
make little difference unless as lemuel had seemed
to think a person invisible himself could see others
when under the effect of the apparatus the next in-
stant i laughed out so loudly that passers-by turned
and stared at me what a fool i had been how
ridiculous my worry over any such possibility i
had forgotten about the marvelous glasses my
friends secret might become public property and
yet be harmless even in the hands of the most des-
perate criminals just as there is an antidote for
every poison so lemuels magic glasses would safe-
guard the world from any evil that might result
from his discovery moreover there was always the
chance that he would be unable to discover a means
of rendering inorganic matter invisible and if so
his invention would be of little value either to hon-
est or dishonest men at thought of the weird situ-
ations that might result i chuckled i could imag-
ine a gunman himself invisible holding up some
citizen and i could visualize the amazed expression
of the victim as he saw a revolver suspended in
mid-air and pointing at him and heard a disem-
bodied voice ordering him to throw up his hands
and it was amusing to picture motor cars appar-
ently empty threading their way through traffic
and stopping and starting at the signals of a visible
whistle blown by an invisible traffic officer yes
ones imagination could run riot and nothing imag-
ined could equal the reality if my friends invention
came into general use and no doubt i had greatly
overestimated the dangers and the undesirable fea-
tures of the discovery in all probability the in-
vention once it became known would create little
more excitement or wonder than had followed the
invention of the telephone the radio or any other
epochal thing people would take it as a matter of
course and no greater harm would come of it than
had resulted from the discovery of the steam en-
gine electricity or any other revolutionary inven-
tion all of which had been looked upon as inimical
to the world and to mankind when they had been
first announced

  at any rate i could not afford to worry over
lemuels affairs even if his marvelous achievement
continually occupied my thoughts

  for several days i heard nothing from dr un-
sinn and i was far too busy with my own work to
visit him no doubt he was deep in his experiments

and i felt sure he would notify me when he had per-
fected anything new and in this i wa not mis-
taken answering my telephone i was greeted by
lemuels voice

  ive got it he cried ive conquered inorganic
matter everything is perfected can you come
over at once

  as on my previous visit miguel admitted me
and as before he requested me to wait for my
friend in the library but this time i was prepared
and had no intention of being either frightened or
amazed at anything dr unsinn might spring on
me at least i thought i was but i had un-
derestimated my friends abilities and the astound-
ing possibilities of his perfected discovery

  standing before the old-fashioned fireplace and
listening intently for the slightest sound which
might betray the approach of an invisible being
i peered about the room half expecting to see lem-
uel materialize or to hear his bodiless voice speak-
ing to me

  as i did so a thin fog or mist seemed to cloud my
vision i can best describe the sensation as similar
to a blind headache from which i had at times
suffered i could distinguish every object in the
library but everything appeared to be slightly out
of focus i rubbed my eyes and stared again in
the wall opposite where i stood a luminous spot
appeared other bright spots seemed to take form
on the ceiling and the floor and on the other walls
without doubt i thought i was in for a terrific
headache for such bright luminous spots always
appeared before my eyes when such an attack was
coming on and then a strange a marvelous an
absolutely astounding and terrifying change took
place floor ceiling walls every object within the
room melted away it was exactly the effect that i
had seen when a film or a lantern-slide is melted by
the heat of the projection machine one instant i
was standing before the fireplace in dr unsinns
library the next instant i was in the centre of a
blank standing in a void to the right where a
wall and two windows had been was the broad
tree-shaded street with its electric lights and
shadowy houses on the further side above
me was space below me intense fathomless
blackness and yet my feet rested on solid matter
and as too amazed and terrified even to cry out i
felt gropingly with my outstretched hands my
fingers touched the mantel and a nearby table with
magazines that rustled at my touch and then in-
stantly i knew what had occurred incredible ut-
terly unbelievable as it seemed i knew that lemuel
by his uncanny his almost supernatural invention
had amused himself and had demonstrated his
powers by rendering the entire apartment invis-
ible 

  my fright gave way to absolute wonder it was
impossible but true and feeling confident that i
was right i rather hesitatingly took a step forward
never shall i forget the sensation surrounded by
nothingness as far as my vision went suspended
in mid-air yet i was walking as securely as firmly
and on as solid a floor as ever reassured i turned
towards the street that stretched before me and
far beneath me as if in a dream i walked for-


amazing stories

ward with arms extended and the next moment
banged with uncomfortable force against a solid
wall and at my involuntary expletive lemuels
hearty laughter came from behind me and i stag-
gered back as an invisible hand slapped my shoul-
ders

  it works exclaimed the voice its the most
wonderful discovery ever made by man

  and the most damnable way to wreck a mans
nerves i blurted out as my hands came into con-
tact with an invisible chair and i dropped weakly
into it

  sorry i had to frighten you a bit said my
friends voice but i wanted to test the matter
thoroughly

  if you want to keep my friendship youll turn
off your confounded machine and get things back
to normal i replied testily

  oh all right agreed lemuel but look here
old man cant you wait a minute i-

  im looking here there and everywhere i ex-
claimed and theres nothing to see and ive had
enough of this

  dash it all then i was wrong after all cried
dr unsinn i felt sure that while subject to the
treatment one person could see another and that
while invisible a person could see objects invisible
to others well after all it doesnt matter so
much

  you get things back to visibility again before
you start lecturing i commanded its worse
than a nightmare

  before i had finished spealcing i found myself
once more amid the familiar surroundings of my
friends library with lemuel seated grinning tri-
umphantly in his favorite chair

  you didnt give me enough time to test my
theories thoroughly he complained i wished to
try the glasses again

  you tested it enough to suit me and more i
said ill take the glasses on your say-so in fact
from now on ill believe anything you say in re-
gard to your discovery or invention or black magic
or whatever it is if you say you can make the en-
tire universe invisible ill not argue with you but
let me tell you its lucky you didnt live a century
or so ago youd be burned for a witch before
now

  you forget that it would be a difficult undertak-
ing to burn an invisible being he reminded me
and just think how scared those witch-baiters
would have been if their stake and fire had sud-
denly vanished from before their eyes

  and ill wager that a lot of people will wish you
had been executed before you made your devilish
discovery i told him

  not a bit of it he declared the world will
welcome it and will acclaim me the greatest inven-
tor and greatest benefactor of the human race
see here i cried all my old fears again pos-
sessing me wont you listen to reason and com-
mon sense youre so carried away with your
success that you havent stopped to think what it
would mean if you let the world know of your in-
vention no dont interrupt me ive worried over
this ever since i was here last and im going to

have it out with you here and now ill admit youve
succeeded better than i expected or hoped for if
you had failed to make inorganic substances in-
visible your invention might not have been so
dangerous as it is the possibilities for destroying
life property society and mankind are too tre-
mendous to even think of cant you see what it
would mean if crooks got hold of it cant you see
what it would mean if it fell into the hands of
bolshevists or revolutionists or governments why
man youd upset the world destroy civilization
wreak unspeakable woe and misery and terror

  piffle ejaculated lemuel if everything and
everybody was invisible the status of the world
would remain unchanged how could a criminal
attack an invisible victim instead of facilitating
crime it would deter crime instead of bringing
on wars and destruction it would prevent such
things how could an army fight an invisible foe
how could a navy attack invisible ships and in-
visible police and officers of law and order could
apprehend criminals much more readily besides
you forget about my glasses if the public or any
part of the public possessed these nothing would
be invisible to the wearers

  idiotic reasoning i declared suppose some-
one stole or learned your secret suppose the agent
of a hostile nation got hold of it or suppose some
gang of criminals secured the invention by fair
means or foul is it likely that they would let the
world know of the glasses which counteract the
process no every moment that you possess the
apparatus for working your devilish trick youre
threatening your fellow men and civilization with
annihilation if you wish to benefit the world de-
stroy every calculation every bit of apparatus
every trace of what youve done and never divulge a
word of it

  youre an old scare-head saicl lemuel though
i could see that my words had had their effect
and he continued i have no intention of follow-
ing your advice there is not the slightest danger
of my discovery being found out unless you or i
divulge it i shall not-for the present at least
and i know you will not moreover even if it were
known no one could work it the procedure is
known only to myself

  anything one man has done another can re-
peat i reminded him

  possibly he admitted but to proceed with my
statement i am free to grant that certain things
you have said are not without foundation i had
in the beginning expected to make my invention
public for of course it is impossible to patent it
anyone could pirate the patent and availing him-
self of his knowledge could render himself invisible
and thus beyond reach of the law but i may decide
not to give my discovery to the world at large it
all depends upon future experiments and tests and
if you really feel as you say in regard to it youll
help me to carry out my tests if in my judgment
and in yours these experiments prove the invention
actually a peril to society then i assure you it will
never be revealed to the public but if on the
other hand you as well as myself are convinced
that the discovery will be beneficial rather than
the man who could vanish



inimical i shall let the world know the secret
hmm well i suppose thats fair enough i as-
sented but before i agree i want to know what
these experiments are which you have in mind
certainly said lemuel i intend to go about
while invisible accompanied by you equipped with
the glasses and from personal observation deter-
mine just what will or might happen and whether
the power to become invisible would be beneficial or
otherwise

  i dont see anything to object to in that i as-
sured him and ill agree to help you provided
you agree not to do anything which might result
in my being held responsible remember i will be
visible and you will not and id hardly care to
stand up in a police court and claim that an invisible
companion was responsible for certain acts of which
i was accused no lemuel i have no desire to end
my days in an insane asylum

  but my dear boy chuckled my friend that
would be a splendid test and of course i could al-
ways materialize at the last moment just imagine
the effect on a policeman or a magistrate

  yes just imagine it i replied drily and un-
less youre willing to agree to my terms you can
imagine your experiments without my aid

  you take me far too seriously exclaimed lem-
uel i have no intention of overstepping the
bounds of the law and i shall certainly so conduct
my experiments that no blame can be attached to
you but he added regretfully it would be much
better if you also would submit to the effect of my
device

  well i wont and thats an end to that i de-
clared positively and i continued theres an-
other matter youll have to promise me that you
will not try the experiment of making things in-
visible by wholesale-no vanishing of rooms build-
ings or other structures while occupied a terrible
panic might and most certainly would result and
this includes trolley cars railway trains moving
vehicles and similar things a panic is the easiest
thing in the world to start and the hardest to stop
i promise assented my friend but i shall most
assuredly tiy my invention on unoccupied struc-
tures and other objects

  i dont care what you try it on provided you do
not endanger life or property i told him

  then well start our experiment tomorrow ex-
claimed lemuel well start from your apartment
if convenient to you ill call at ten tomorrow morn-
ing

chapter iv
dr unsinns experiment

i do not know exactly what object dr unsinn
had in view or what he hoped to accomplish by
his experiment certainly he had demon-
strated his discovery and had proved it successful
by his tests on myself possibly he felt that human
sight might vary that some persons might find him
invisible while to others he was visible or again he
may have wished merely to gratify his own vanity
and enjoy the sensation of moving unseen among
his fellows he could not in fact clearly explain

to me what he expected or why he was so insistent
upon having me accompany him when as we had
agreed we set out from my apartment but in
view of the events which followed i feel sure that
it was fate or predestination that led him to under-
take his experiment

  wearing the marvelous glasses in order that i
might not lose sight of my companion who had
rendered himself invisible i hailed an approaching
trolley cax but habit is a strong and persistent
thing and the human mind is greatly governed by
the impressions it receives through the eyes ahd
at the very outset of our venture i learned this to my
chagrin boarding the car with lemuel at my
heels i handed the conductor a dime and he re-
turned a nickel in change i was on the point of
handing it back and the word two was on the
tip of my tongue when a nudge from lemuels el-
bow brought me to my senses as my friend was
plainly visible to me i had completely forgotten that
he was invisible to the conductor and i mentally
wowed to watch my step more closely in the future
there were few passengers in the car and my com-
panion seated himself in one corner while i took
the seat beside him and presently habit once
again came to the fore and came near to getting
me into a most embarrassing situation quite for-
getting momentarily that my friend was invisible
i spoke to him and he quite in his ordinary man-
ner replied in fact we were carrying on quite an
animated conversation when i was suddenly brought
to a realization of what we were doing by the be-
havior of the other passengers everyone was gaz-
ing at me some curiously others half pityingly as
if thinking me either mad or intoxicated while still
others were grinning and thoroughly enjoying the
spectacle of a man carrying on a conversation with
himself even the conductor had entered the car
and was staring at me a strangely puzzled expres-
sion on his face as if undecided whether i was a
dangerous lunatic or a common drunk fortunately
my presence of mind came to my rescue and flush-
ing but forcing a smile i turned to an intelligent
appearing gentleman near me i must apologize for
my absent-mindedness i stammered i was merely
practising a bit of ventriloquism for my act and
inadvertently spoke aloud

   this lame explanation appeared to satisfy every-
one the passengers resumed their former occupa-
tions of staring vacantly out of the windows read-
ing their papers or gazing absently at the advertis-
ing placards within the car while the conductor
evidently relieved betook himself again to the rear
platform

  by now however the experiment was getting on
my nerves i had feared that my friends absent-
mindedness might lead him into trouble and yet
by my own thoughtless actions i had twice within a
few moments barely escaped getting into deep water
and the fact that i could not speak my mind to my
invisible companion and that i had pledged myself
to see the experiment through only added to my
irritation as inwardly fuming i resolved to keep
my mind constantly alert to avoid further em-
barrassment the car came to a stop and a stout
pompous and overdressed middle-aged woman en-


amazing stories

tered as the car started with a jerk she lurched
forward and before i realized her intention
she plumped herself into the apparently vacant seat
beside me a grunt from my invisible friend and a
terrific shriek from the stout female instantly fol-
lowed and as if bounced from a spring she sprang
up her eyes blazing her face white with indigna-
tion and fairly shouting a torrent of abuse as she
shook her beringed fist in my face

  brute disreputable old rake she screamed
ill have you jailed ill have you imprisoned
instantly the car was in an uproar passengers
crowded forward necks were craned everyone
talked at once and the conductor pushed his burly
figure between the irate female and myself

  hey whats the game he demanded what
did this guy do to yer lady

  he obtruded himself beneath me-the unspeak-
able fiend she shrieked he endeavored to em-
brace me and pinched me

  i did nothing of the sort i declared fairly
shouting to make myself heard i-

  tell it to the judge interrupted the conductor
stepping towards me

  fortunately for me the gentleman to whom i had
offered my ventriloquistic explanation now inter-
vened in my behalf

  the lady is mistaken he declared rising and
restraining the conductor i was observing her
and this gentleman closely she seated herself in
the vacant seat and this gentleman did not move
possibly-

  yeah the old guys right chimed in a greasy
mechanic opposite he never done nothin the
dames nutty what guyd want her to squat in his
lap

  instantly the womans wrath was turned on this
new victim but before violence could be done the
conductor intervened hey quit this roughhouse
stuff he ordered if youse want to fight take it
outside guess youre in wrong lady sit down
or get off and call a cop

  still glaring and voicing her opinions of every-
one and especially of me she again descended
ponderously to lemuels seat

  an involuntary exclamation escaped my lips but
it was uncalled for during the excitement dr
unsinn had risen and had slipped unseen to the
rear platform where he was beckoning to me wild-
ly

  only too glad to escape i rose and joined him and
as the car came to a halt we stepped off

  confound the woman he exclaimed the moment
we were alone she very nearly fractured my
thighs you would have gotten us into a nice fix
if she had how could a doctor set an invisible
bone and the apparatus in my pocket might have
been ruined so that i could not have regained my
visible form youll have to be more careful in
future why didnt you stop her or warn me
for an instant i was too amazed at his outburst
to speak so he too was blaming me for all the
trouble this was too much

  look here i cried ive had enough of this
youre as well able to take care of yourself while
invisible as when visible if youre going to de-

pend on me to keep you out of trouble ill quit
and you can go ahead with your damnable experi-
ment alone and you talk about getting into
trouble youre safe and im the goat every time
think its fun for me to be called names and
threatened with arrest id look nice trying to ex-
plain matters to the police or the judge wouldnt
i

  lemuel chuckled come come he exclaimed
placing his hand on my arm i didnt mean to
have you take it that way old man but well both
have to be a trifle more circumspect in future and
really it was most amusing now i propose tak-
ing a taxi hereafter i am convinced that trolley
cars are not suitable conveyances for me in con-
ducting my tests but the test was most conclusive
after all

  by now the humor of the incident had outweighed
the more serious side of the affair in my mind and
i laughed heartily with lemuel as we waited on the
corner for an empty taxi to approach

  within the vehicle we could converse freely for
the noise of the motor and the surrounding traffic
prevented the driver from hearing our voices

  lemuel elated at the success of his experiments
was now becoming reckless and suggested that it
would be most interesting and amusing to render
the taxi and ourselves invisible but i sternly for-
bade it youre an idiot i declared we could be
maimed or killed even if we were invisible dont
you realize wed be in a wreck within ten seconds
if you make any more such crazy suggestions ill
see that youre placed in a lunatic asylum

  easier said than done he reminded me but
all joking aside i must try the effect on something
more than myself ah i have it stop the cab
will you

  as he had been speaking we had passed a huge
office building in course of erection and as i paid
the taxi driver lemuel was gazing appraisingly at
the towering structure of steel and stone

  a splendid opportunity he cried enthusiastic-
ally possibly my pocket apparatus may not have
sufficient power but-

  confound you i cried didnt you promise
me you wouldnt try your invention on any struc-
ture 

  i did not he declared decisively i merely
agreed not to render invisible any structure con-
taining human occupants this building is vacant
a strike is in progress and the place is deserted

  well you promised not to do anything which
would cause a panic or trouble i persisted

  and i intend to keep my promise he replied
i shall defer my experiment until the noon hour
when the streets will be practically deserted and
there can be no panic and i fail to see how it
can cause any trouble

  all arguments which i could offer were in vain
and i must confess i was rather fascinated by
my friends suggestion to cause a towering steel
and stone structure to vanish would indeed be a
feat-if it could be done and i was rather anxious
to find what the effect on the public would be but
as it was still nearly two hours before noon we
the man who could vanish

resumed our way with lemuel seeking new oppor-
tunities to test his discovery on the public

   the sidewalks were thronged with shoppers and
 presently as we pushed our way through the crowd
 a terrified shriek pierced the hum and noises of the
 busy street as my companion either accidently or
 thoughtlessly bumped into a passing woman as
 she collapsed in a faint i sprang forward but dr
 unsinn was before me completely forgetting that
 he was invisible he stooped down raised the vic-
 tims head and then lifting her in his arms started
 for a nearby drug store instantly pandemonium
 broke loose screams shouts frightened cries rose
 from the crowd which had quickly gathered and
 awed unable to believe their eyes men women and
 children shoved crowded and fought to make way
 for the womans form floating in air through their
 midst for a moment my heart seemed to cease
 beating all my fears appeared about to be justi-
 fied in an instant there would be a panic with
 crushed and trampled bodies and all the attendant
 horrors but for once the impending catastrophe
 was stayed by the very panic and terror of the
 crowd so intent were the people on the incredible
 sight which had terrified them that they stood as
 if turned to stone petrified with amazement and
 fear

   and then a still more incredible thing happened
 the womans body suddenly vanished lemuel had
 bethought himself and undoubtedly confused at
 the conditions he had created had tried to improve
 matters by rendering his victim invisible and the
 seemingly supernatural occurrences had been wit-
 nessed by myself as well as by the crowd for in
 the melde the glasses had been wrenched from my
 nose and were hanging dangling useless and tem-
 porarily forgotten from my breast pocket and as
 the womans form vanished a strange sound half
 sigh half groan arose from the gaping multitude
 before hundreds of eyes the impossible had taken
 place a woman had fainted without reason or
 cause she had risen and had floated through the
 air and had utterly vanished in the midst of the
 crowd for an instant they remained spellbound
 awed into absolute silence and in that instant
 lemuel had entered the drug store with his burden
 and had deposited her gently but hurriedly upon a
 chair where as instantaneously as she had van-
 ished she again resumed her customary form as
 every occupant of the shop had rushed to the doors
 and windows to see what was taking place on the
 street nobody noticed the sudden reappearance of
 the woman to me it was all nearly as surprising
 as to the public but i had sense enough left to
 hastily don my glasses as lemuel slipped past the
 white-clad employees of the store and taking care
 not to collide with another bystander rejoined me

   we had no desire to linger and see the results of
 the affair and hurried from the crowd and turned
 into a nearby cross street i could scarcely berate
 my friend for what had occurred for it had been
 an unavoidable accident but i did not hesitate to
 use it as an example of the dire results which might
 follow if he kept on with his experiment or made
 his secret public

   lemuel was however far more excited and dis-

 turbed than i and without even attempting to re-
 ply he rushed into a subway entrance without
 stopping to think he hurried to the change booth
 and thrust a quarter under the wicket without
 glancing up the occupant shoved back five nickels
 and my friend gathered them up but as the coins
 slid from the wooden shelf and vanished without
 apparent reason and with no human hand grasping
 them the man peered from his cage an expression
 of mortal terror swept across his stolid features
 and with an inarticulate choking cry he reeled
 backward from his stool but lemuel did not stop
 the events of the past few minutes had completely
 upset him and the scientific mind when upset often
 becomes panicky for the moment he had no
 doubt completely forgotten that he was invisible
 and rushing forward he boarded the train with me
 at his heels fortunately it was a dull hour for

the subway-my friend was not forced to jostle or

push his way which most assuredly would have re-
resulted in further troubles--less than half a
dozen passengers were within the car which we
entered lemuel sat silent evidently composing
his thoughts and fumbling in one of his pockets
the next moment a terrified shout reechoed through
the car a woman fainted the guard appeared at
the door there was the hissing of released air and
the train came to a jolting lurching stop i had a
premonition of what had occurred and snatching
off the pink glasses i found my worst fears more
than fulfilled the car and its oocupants had com-
pletely disappeared with eyes fairly popping from
their sockets mouth agape and shaking as if with
ague the guard stood on the platform of the next
car staring utterly aghast at the void that
stretched between him and the car ahead reason
and instinet told him it was impossible but his
senses told him that a car had completely vanished
while speeding at fifty miles an hoar and had
taken its passengers along with it so thoroughly
frightened and flabbergasted was the guard that
even lemuels voice issuing from space failed to
attract his attention

  confound the thing exclaimed my companion
i must have pressed the wrong button or it may
have been shifted when i carried that fainting wo-
man likely as not it was injured when that mis-
erable creature seated herself in my lap now-

 my god man cant you do something i
cried visions of the car and its occupants remain-
ing forever invisible flashing through my mind

  then as instantaneously and unexpectedly as it
had vanished the car was once more in the train
it had all occurred in a few seconds and the be-
wildered passengers stared about rubbing their
eyes as if awakening from a dream while the guard
blinking and muttering jerked the signal cord and
the train again rumbled on

  fortunately for all concerned dr unsinn had
managed to get his devilish machine to function
properly and no harm had come of the incident
but i had had about enough of it all and i feared
that at any moment the apparatus might fail en-
tirely or might do the wrong thing at the next
stop i left the train foreing my friend along with
me and dragging sim into an obscure corner of


amazing stories

the station platform where there was no chance of
being overheard i expressed my view of his ex-
periment in no gentle terms

  you cant expect a delicate device to withstand
two hundred and fifty pounds of feminine flesh and
bone can you he demanded im not surprised
that it was temporarily disarranged but its en-
tirely right now if you dont believe it ill demon-
strate it right here

  dont you dare i exclaimed youll resume
your normal form as a demonstration and well
go to lunch then back to my apartments and no
more of this experiment youve caused enough
trouble for one day and ill have a nervous break-
down if this sort of thing continues

  ill agree on one condition replied lemuel
with more readiness than i had expected im
determined to try my experiment on that unfinished
building after that ill cease my experiment for
today

  in vain i argued lemuel could be as obstinate
as a mule at times and at last realizing that he
was bound to carry out his desires and that if i
left him he might bring about dire results when
alone i assented to his condition

  so with dr unsinn once more his usual self
we found a quiet restaurant where i was accustomed
to dining the waiter having taken our order
handed me a copy of the latest edition of a paper
and half fearfully i glanced through it expect-
ing to find an account of one or more of the strange
occurrences for which we had been responsible but
nothing had appeared and i decided that in all
probability the witnesses had not cared to report
an experience which would expose them to ridicule
and a suspicion of insanity

  lemuel was in high spirits to be sure he had
made one or two mistakes but in each case as he
took care to point out to me his errors had as
he put it added to the value of his experiment and
of his observations and he could not resist crow-
ing over me a bit when he called my attention to
the fact that neither panic nor disasters had re-
sulted

  it is exactly as i foresaw he declared the
entirely new and unknown does not terrorize hu-
man beings wonder and amazement temporarily
paralyze the muscles and as you should know two
opposed impressions cannot occupy the mind at the
same time hence fear cannot have a place where
wonder is predominant

  no my friend your fears of my discovery creat-
ing a panic or causing terror and shock are ab-
solutely unfounded

  you forget about the woman who fainted and
the man in the subway i reminded him

  utterly beside the question he snorted in
the case of the woman it was bodily contact which
frightened her and in the other case the fact that
the money vanished in neither case was it due to
fright at my invisibility

  its hopeless to argue with you i said in-
directly your invisibility was at the bottom of it
aflfi heaven alone knows what a panic might have
resulted if that car had remained invisible long

enough for the passengers of the other cars to have
investigated the cause of the train stopping

  i can and shall prove i am right he declared
come well have a try at that building and ill
wager no one will be terrified

  for heavens sake dont vanish here i cried
as i saw lemuel reach towards an inner pocket
wait until we are alone id suggest a telephone
booth as the most convenient and safest spot

  a few moments later my friend entered a booth
and almost instantly emerged visible only to my-
self hailing a taxi we were soon in the vicinity
of the partly completed hartwell building it was
the lunch hour and very few persons were on the
street opposite the building a chauffeur dozed
in his taxi two fruit vendors argued in vociferous
italian on the corner and a few pedestrians who
had dined early were wandering about gazing into
shop windows entering the main doorway of the
building we found ourselves in the spacious rotunda
with its litter of discarded building materials and
abandoned scaffoldings

  ah here we are exclaimed lemuel gleefully
now if my pocket apparatus can produce results
on this edifice i shall feel that nothing is too great
to be rendered invisible entire armies navies
cities yes--

  then i hope it doesnt work i interrupted
but my hopes were in vain as lemuel had been
speaking he had adjusted his instrument and
scarcely had my last word been uttered when the
twenty stories of concrete steel and stone dis-
solved about us leaving us invisible to others
standing in air above the yawning abyss of the
foundation excavation

  for a brref instant no one within sight appeared
to notice that the structure had vanished then
the dozing chauffeur jerked upright his jaw sag-
ged and with a wild yell he sat transfixed pointing
dramatically at the empty lot where the building
had stood at his cry everyone on the street turned
shouts and exclamations drew occupants of stores
and restaurants on the run with screeching horns
taxis came tearing into the street and in almost no
time nineteenth street was filled with a gaping
gesticulating excited crowd

  didnt i tell you so cried lemuel trium-
phantly no one is frightened all- his
words were cut short by the clanging of a bell
as a patrol wagon came dashing around a corner
while from the opposite direction the screaming
siren of a fire truck added to the uproar

  quick i cried someones called the policc
and turned in a fire alarm in a minute theyll be
here theyll find us and therell be the devil to
pay

  lemuel roared with glee you forget were in-
visible he reminded me and it will be highly
amusing to witness the reactions of the police and
firemen when they find solid walls where obviously
there are none and imagine the results when those
who succeed in entering vanish instantly

  turn off the damnable machine instantly i
commanded him this has gone far enough

  the police and firemen were advancing towards
us hesitatingly but determined although what they
the man who

expected to accomplish or why they imagined their
services were required is still a mystery to me
as i have said before habit is one of the strongest
of influences dr unsinn being a great respector
of law and seeing the police approaching suc-
cumbed to force of habit and almost involuntarily
stopped his mechanism instantly the huge build-
ing once more towered above the street and with a
hoarse cry of warning and alarm the crowd broke
and fled seeking refuge in doorways and stores as
if fearing the structure might crash thundering in-
to the street even the police sprang back but
the firemen to their credit be it said stood their
ground and thinking something was expected of
them turned half a dozen streams of water on the
building in the excitement lemuel and i slipped
unseen from a rear entrance and hurried from
sight around a corner

  despite all my experiences with my friends dis-
covery i was shaken and upset by this latest demon-
stration of his power and even lemuel was i
could see in a highly excitable frame of mind his
device had exceeded even his most sanguine ex-
pectations and his experiment had from his point
of view been a huge success

  several times he started to speak but each time
i checked him for the sidewalks were thronged
with pedestrians and i had no desire to have atten-
tion turned towards us after our latest achieve-
ment

  we were now in a shopping district and as we
walked along picking our way with care in order
that lemuel might not jostle some passer-by i
noticed a rough-looking heavily-built fellow loiter-
ing near the edge of the sidewalk and furtively
glancing at each woman who passed him suddenly
he darted forward snatched a handbag from a
stylishly-dressed girl and dashed up the street
screaming that she had been robbed the girl
started after him cries of stop thief re-
sounded from every side and a score of persons
turned and gave chase lemuel and i had been
nearest to the fellow and with one accord we were
after him quite forgetting that one of us was in-
visible dashing around a corner the rascal
entered an almost deserted side street with us at his
heels and the howling mob half a block in the rear
in my youth i had been something of a runner and
lemuel had it flashed over me won the coveted s
of our university as a sprinter rapidly we gained
upon the fellow and as he turned to duck into an
alleyway lemuel grasped him by the coat with a
command to halt

  instantly and without stopping the fellow half
turned and dealt a vicious back-handed blow with
his doubled fist it caught lemuel full in the face
and with a gasping cry he staggered back into my
arms with a two inch gash laying bare the cheek
bone and blood gushing from the wound but
even at that moment while supporting my injured
comrade my attention was focussed upon the ruf-
fian who had struck him down feeling the impact
of his fist upon a fellow-beings flesh he had
wheeled and the next moment stood rooted to
the spot

  instead of a form stretched on the pavement or a

could vanish	

battered man staggering back not a living soul
was near with the exception of myself the fel-
lows eyes grew wide his mouth opened and the
next moment he uttered a terrified scream and
dropping the hand-bag fell to his knees covering
his eyes with his hands babbling incoherently and
shaking with mortal fear upon the flagging be-
fore me was a blotch of blood and from nowhere
drops of blood were slowly adding to the crimson
pool lemuel might be invisible but the blood from
his wound was not to the cowering superstitious
wretch the blood slowly dripping from an unseen
victim must have been a most awful and terrifying
sight

  the oncoming mob now was nearly upon us and
a dozen fears swept through my confused brain
what if the blood stains on the pavement attracted
attention and an explanation were demanded  what
would happen to my invisible companion as the
mob dashing onward bore him down and trampled
him under foot and what if the cowering wretch
before us blurted out the truth but i need not
have worried so intent were the man-chasers up-
on their quarry that they gave no heed even to me
and in a moment the red blotch was completely
obliterated by scores of feet as the crowd sur-
rounded us and seized the thief who offered no re-
sistance and almost by a miracle dr unsinn
escaped the fate i had feared i sprang behind him
as the mob reached us and thus partially shielded
him but despite this the shouting panting per-
spiring crowd jostled and bumped him tearing his
coat half from his shoulders knocking his spectacles
into the street where they were instantly ground
to bits underfoot tearing his collar awry knocking
off his hat and as i knew from his half-stifled
grunts exclamations and ejaculations giving him
many a painful jab and bump with elbows and
shoulders but in that hub-bub the cries of any
one man were inaudible and as everyone jostled
and pushed his neighbor no one noticed that an in-
visible but solid human form was in their midst
luckily the mob surged forward around the thief
and left a fairly clear space through which i half-
dragged half-pushed my battered bruised and dis-
hevelled comrade

  attracted by the commotion half a dozen taxis
had drawn up to the curb their drivers craning
their necks and peering into the milling crowd
about the captive and giving  heed to anything
else quickly opening the door of the nearest i
bundled lemuel inside and at last succeeding in
gaining the chauffeurs attention i ordered him to
drive off he turned with a half-uttered oath and
refused to move but noticing my own rumpled ap-
pearance and realizing i had been in the thick of
the trouble his tone changed and he asked what it
was all about in a few words i explained that it
was merely a purse-snatcher and that i had been
knocked over in the mele for an instant he
gazed suspiciously at me for my hands were a bit
smeared with lemuels blood and for a brief instant
i trembled for fear he would drive us to the nearest
police station but he had lost interest in the
crowd and excitement and as i suggestively showed
continued on page 
this apparatus seemed only reasonably large and near to us and then i saw how exceedingly little the selenxtes upon it cmcdf and 
realized the full immensity of cavern and machine it was stupendous

sedford is a writer but he also has inflated
confidence in his abilities as a first-rate busi-
ness man because of some business reverses he
has gone off to a very secluded spot to unite a play
and so make up some of his financial losses but even
there he cannot work undisturbed for every day at
the same hour a mr cavor passes by his house
stops makes some buzzing sounds stays awhile
looks at his watch and returns to his oum home
bedford talks to him and stops this annoying pro-
cedure but its cessation makes it impossible for
cavor to continue with his work he mentions this
fact to bedford and in the course of the conversa-
tion nezv plans and ideas are developed mr cavor
is a scientist and just now is working on a new in-
vention which he calls cavorite and which is sup-
posed to be opaque to gravitation-cutting off
bodies from gravitating to each other

   bedford becomes enthusiastic and sees great com-
mercial possibilities for cavorite and agrees to drop
his writing and become business manager for
cavor and cavorite

   soon cavor accidently succeeds in his experi-

ments and the accident causes some thousands of
dollars in damages to sitrrounding buildings and
both their homes and almost cost them their lives
but though the discovery proves so nearly dis-
astrous cavor gets a new inspiration and he starts
work on his new idea immediately he builds a
space flyer which proves to be a perfect conveyance
for interplanetary travel they go off to the moon
provisioned with plenty-of condensed food and other
necessary comforts for a long trip they arrive
on the moon without any mishap just before the
lunar dawn soon after they land the black and
white of the scenery disappear the glare of the
sun takes on a faint tinge of amber and the shadows
are deep purple and to the westward the sky is
blue and clear and the arctic appearance is gone
then an atmosphere rose about them but still it
seemed like a lifeless world and then suddenly
they saw movement-little oval bodies that looked
like pebbles bursting open one by one-and in a
short time the whole slope was dotted with small
plants growing quickly into huge spikes and fleshy
vegetation

attenuated air that we also should be
able to breathe

  yes said cavor if it is air we see

  in a little while i
said these plants will be
as high as we are sup-

-is it certain how

do you know that stuff is
air it may be nitrogen
-it may be carbonic acid
gas even

  that is easy he said
and set about proving it

he produced a big piece
of crumpled paper from
the bale lit it and thrust
it hastily through the
manhole valve i bent
forward and peered down

through the thick glass for its appearance outside
that little flame on whose evidence depended so
much

  i saw the paper drop out and lie lightly upon the
snow the pink flame of its burning vanished for

 meet the inhabitants of the moon nothing more grotesque
 nothing more imaginative probably has ever been written
 than the picture that ifells paints of the lunarians as con-
 tained in this installment it is impressive in its daring and
 breadth yet it is not at all impossible perhaps not even
 improbable if as we know it is impossible for creatures
 to roam about the moon due to its lack of atmosphere and
 if there is an atmosphere within the moon then creatures
 of the kindthat mr jvells paints so vividly in this story
 might well be expected to be seen there if explorers ever
 land upon that satellite

i saw a little blue tongue upon the edge of it that
trembled and crept and spread

  quietly the whole sheet save where it lay in
immediate contact with the snow charred and
shrivelled and sent up a quivering thread of smoke
there was no doubt left to me the atmosphere of
the moon was either pure oxygen or air and capable
therefore-unless its tenuity was excessive-of
supporting our alien life we might emerge-and
live

  i sat down with my legs on either side of the
manhole and prepared to
unscrew it but cavor
stopped me there is
first a little precaution
he said he pointed out
that although there was
certainly an oxygenated
atmosphere outside it
might still be so rarefied
as to cause us grave in-
jury he reminded me
of mountain sickness and
of the bleeding that often
afflicts aeronauts who

 have ascended too swiftly

bthmbwbkmaawwwbbbw and he spent some time in

                    the preparation of a
sickly-tasting drink which he insisted on my shar-
ing it made me feel a little numb but otherwise
had no effect on me then he permitted me to begin
unscrewing

  presently the glass stopper of the manhole was

an instant it seemed to be extinguished and then sp far undone that the denser air within our sphere




amazing stories

began to escape along the thread of the screw sing-
ing as a kettle sings before it boils thereupon he
made me desist it speedily became evident that
the pressure outside was very much less than it was
within how much less it was we had no means
of telling

  i sat grasping the stopper with both hands ready
to close it again if in spite of our intense hope
the lunar atmosphere should after all prove too
rarefied for us and cavor sat with a cylinder of
compressed oxygen at hand to restore our pressure
we looked at one another in silence and then at
the fantastic vegetation that swayed and grew
visibly and noiselessly without and ever that shrill
piping continued

  my blood-vessels began to throb in my ears and
the sound of cavors movements diminished i
noted how still everything had become because of
the thinning of the air

  as our air sizzled out from the screw the mois-
ture of it condensed in little puffs

  presently i experienced a peculiar shortness of
breath that lasted indeed during the whole of the
time of our exposure to the moons exterior atmo-
sphere and a rather unpleasant sensation about the
ears and finger-nails and the back of the throat
grew upon my attention and presently passed off
again

  but then came vertigo and nausea that abruptly
changed the quality of my courage i gave the lid
of the manhole half a turn and made a hasty ex-
planation to cavor but now he was the more
sanguine he answered me in a voice that seemed
extraordinarily small and remote because of the
thinness of the air that carried the sound he re-
commended a nip of brandy and set me the example
and presently i felt better i turned the manhole
stopper back again the throbbing in my ears
grew louder and then i remarked that the piping
note of the outrush had ceased for a time i could
not be sure that it had ceased

  well said cavor in the ghost of a voice

  well said i

  shall we go on

  i thought is this all

  if you can stand it he said

  by way of answer i went on unscrewing i lifted
the circular operculum from its place and laid it
carefully on the bale a flake or so of snow whirled
and vanished as that thin and unfamiliar air took
possession of our sphere i knelt and then seated
myself at the edge of the manhole peering over it
beneath within a yard of my face lay the untrod-
den snow of the moon

  there came a little pause our eyes met

  it doesnt distress your lungs too much said
cavor

  no i said i can stand this

  he stretched out his hand for his blanket thrust
his head through its central hole and wrapped it
about him he sat down on the edge of the man-
hole he let his feet drop until they were within six
inches of the lunar ground he hesitated for a
moment then thrust himself forward dropped
these intervening inches and stood upon the un-
trodden soil of the moon

  as he stepped forward he was refracted grotes-
quely by the edge of the glass he stood for a
moment looking this way and that then he drew
himself together and leapt

  the glass distorted everything but it seemed to
me even then to be an extremely big leap he had
at one bound become remote he seemed twenty
or thirty feet off he was standing high upon a
rocky mass and gesticulating back to me perhaps
he was shouting-but the sound did not reach me
but how the deuce had he done this i felt like
a man who has just seen a new conjuring trick

  in a puzzled state of mind i too dropped through
the manhole i stood up just in front of me the
snowdrift had fallen away and made a sort of ditch

i made a step and jumped

  i found myself flying through the air saw the
rock on which he stood coming to meet me clutched
it and clung in a state of infinite amazement

  i gasped a painful laugh i was tremendously
confused cavor bent down and shouted in piping
tones for me to be careful

  i had forgotten that on the moon with only an
eightieth part of the earths mass and a quarter of
its diameter my weight was barely a sixth what it
was on earth but now that fact insisted on being
remembered

  we are out of mother earths leading-strings
now he said

  with a guarded effort i raised myself to the top
and moving as cautiously as a rheumatic patient
stood up beside him under the blaze of the sun
the sphere lay behind us on its dwindling snow-
drift thirty feet away

  as far as the eye could see over the enormous
disorder of rocks that formed the crater floor the
same bristling scrub that surrounded us was start-
ing into life diversified here and there by bulging
masses of a cactus form and scarlet and purple
lichens that grew so fast they seemed to crawl over
the rocks the whole area of the crater seemed
to me then to be one similar wilderness up to the
very foot of the surrounding cliff

  this cliff was apparently bare of vegetation save
at its base and with buttresses and terraces and
platforms that did not very greatly attract our
attention at the time it was many miles away from
us in every direction we seemed to be almost at
the centre of the crater and we saw it through a
certain haziness that drove before the wind for
there was even a wind now in the thin air a swift
yet weak wind that chilled exceedingly but exerted
little pressure it was blowing round the crater as
it seemed to the hot illuminated side from the foggy
darkness under the sunward wall it was difficult
to look into this eastward fog we had to peer with
half-closed eyes beneath the shade of our hands
because of the fierce intensity of the motionless sun

  it seems to be deserted said cavor absolutely
desolate

  i looked about me again i retained even then a
clinging hope of some quasi-human evidence some
pinnacle or building some house or engine but
everywhere one looked spread the tumbled rocks in
peaks and crests and the darting scrub and those
the first men in the moon



bulging cacti that swelled and swelled a flat nega-
tion as it seemed of all such hope

  it looks as though these plants had it to them-
selves i said i see no trace of any other crea-
ture

  no insects-no birds-no not a trace not a
scrap nor particle of animal life if there was-
what would they do in the night  no theres
just these plants alone

  i shaded my eyes with my hand its like the
landscape of a dream these things are less like
earthly land plants than the things one imagines
among the rocks at the bottom of the sea look
at that yonder one might imagine it a lizard
changed into a plant and the glare

  this is only the fresh morning said cavor

  he sighed and looked about him this is no
world for men he said and yet in a way-it
appeals

  he became silent for a time then commenced his
meditative humming

  i started at a gentle touch and found a thin sheet
of livid lichen lapping over my shoe i kicked at
it and it fell to powder and each speck began to
grow

  i heard cavor exclaim sharply and perceived
that one of the fixed bayonets of the scrub had
pricked him

  he hesitated his eyes sought among the rocks
about us a sudden blaze of pink had crept -up a
ragged pillar of crag it was a most extraordinary
pink a livid magenta

  look said i turning and behold cavor had
vanished

  for an instant i stood transfixed then i made a
hasty step to look over the verge of the rock but
in my surprise at his disappearance i forgot once
more that we were on the moon the thrust of
my foot that i made in striding would have carried
me a yard on earth on the moon it carried me six
-a good five yards over the edge for the moment
the thing had something of the effect of those night
mares when one falls and falls for while one
falls sixteen feet in the first second of a fall on
earth on the moon one falls two and with only
asixth of ones weight i fell or rather i jumped
down about ten yards i-suppose it seemed to take
quite a long time five or six seconds i should
think i floated through the air and fell like a
feather knee-deep in a snow-drift in the bottom of
a gully of blue-gray white-veined rock

  i looked about me cavor i cried but no
cavor was visible

  cavor i cried louder and the rocks echoed me

  i turned fiercely to the rocks and clambered to
the summit of them cavor i cried my voice
sounded like the voice of a lost lamb

  the sphere too was not in sight and for a
moment a horrible feeling of desolation pinched
my heart

  then i saw him he was laughing and gesticu-
lating to attract my attention he was on a bare
patch of rock twenty or thirty yards away i could
not hear his voice but jump said his gestures i
hesitated the distance seemed enormous yet i

reflected that surely i must be able to clear a
greater distance than cavor

  i made a step back gathered myself together
and leapt -with all my might i seemed to shoot
right up in the air as though i should never come
down   

  it was horrible and delightful and as wild as a
nightmare to go flying off in this fashion i realized
my leap had been altogether too violent i flew
clean over cavors head and beheld a spiky con-
fusion in a gully spreading to meet my fall i gave
a yelp of alarm i put out my hands and straight-
ened my legs

  i hit a huge fungoid bulk that burst all about me
scattering a mass of orange spores in every direc-
tion and covering me with orange powder i rolled
over spluttering and came to rest convulsed with
breathless laughter

  i became aware of cavors little round face peer-
ing over a bristling hedge he shouted some faded
inquiry eh i tried to shout but could not do
so for want of breath he made his way towards
me coming gingerly among the bushes

  weve got to be careful he said this moon
has no discipline shell let us smash ourselves

  he helped me to my feet you exerted your-
self too much he said dabbing at the yellow stuff
with his hand to remove it from my garments

  i stood passive and panting allowing him to beat
off the spores from my knees and elbows and lecture
me upon my misfortunes we dont quite allow
for the gravitation our muscles are scarcely
educated yet we must practise a little when you
have got your breath

  i pulled two or three little thorns out of my
hand and sat for a time on a boulder of roek my
muscles were quivering and i had that feeling of
personal disillusionment that comes at the first fall
to the learner of cycling on earth

  it suddenly occurred to cavor that the cold air
in the gully after the brightness of the sun might
give me a fever so we clambered back into the
sunlight we found that beyond a few abrasions
i had received no serious injuries from my tumble
and at cavors suggestion we were presently looking
round for some safe and easy landing-place for my
next leap we chose a rocky slab some ten yards
off separated from us by a little thicket of olive-
green spikes

  imagine it there said cavor who was assum-
ing the airs of a trainer and he pointed to a spot
about four feet from my toes this leap i managed
without difficulty and i must confess i found a
certain satisfaction in cavors falling short by a
foot or so and tasting the spikes of the scrub one
has to be careful you see he said pulling out
his thorns and with that he ceased to be my mentor
and became my fellow-learner in the art of lunar
locomotion

  we chose a still easier jump and did it without
difficulty and then leapt back again and to and
fro several times accustoming our muscles to the
new standard i could never have believed had
i not experienced it how rapid that adaptation
would be in a very little time indeed certainly
after fewer than thirty leaps we could judge the


amazing stories

effort necessary for a distance with almost ter-
restrial assurance

  and all this time the lunar plants were growing
around us higher and denser and more entangled
every moment thicker and taller spiked plants
green cactus masses fungi fleshy and lichenous
things strangest radiate and sinuous shapes but
we were so intent upon our leaping that for a time
we gave no heed to their unfaltering expansion

  an extraordinary elation had taken possession
of us partly i think it was our sense of release
from the confinement of the sphere mainly how-
ever the thin sweetness of the air which i am
certain contained a much larger proportion of
oxygen than our terrestrial atmosphere in spite
of the strange quality of all about us i felt as
adventurous and experimental as a cockney would
do placed for the first time among mountains and
i do not think it occurred to either of us face to
face though we were with the unknown to be very
greatly afraid

  we were bitten by a spirit of enterprise we
selected a lichenous kopje perhaps fifteen yards
away and landed neatly on its summit one after
the other good we cried to each other good
and cavor made three steps and went off to a tempt-
ing slope of snow a good twenty yards and more
beyond i stood for a moment struck by the
grotesque effect of his soaring figure-his dirty
cricket cap and spiky hair his little round body his
arms and his knickerbockered legs tucked up tightly
-against the weird spaciousness of the lunar scene
a gust of laughter seized me and then i stepped
off to follow plump i dropped beside him

  we made a few gargantuan strides leapt three
or four times more and sat down at last in a
lichenous hollow our lungs were painful we
sat holding our sides and recovering our breath
looking appreciation at one another cavor panted
something about amazing sensations and then
came a thought into my head for the moment
it did not seem a particularly appalling thought
simply a natural question arising out of the situa-
tion

  by the way i said where exactly is the
sphere

  cavor looked at me eh

  the full meaning of what we were saying struck
me sharply

  cavor i cried laying a hand on his arm
where is the sphere

chapter x
lost men in the moon

his face caught something of my dismay
he stood up and stared about him at the
scrub that fenced us in and rose about us
straining upward in a passion of growth he put
a dubious hand to his lips he spoke with a sudden
lack of assurance i think he said slowly we left
it    somewhere    about there

  he pointed a hesitating finger that wavered in
an arc

  im not sure his look of consternation

deepened anyhow he said with his eyes on me
it cant be far

  we had both stood up we made unmeaning
ejaculations our eyes sought in the twining
thickening jungle round about us

  all about us on the sunlit slopes frothed and
swayed the darting shrubs the swelling cactus
the creeping lichens and wherever the shade re-
mained the snowdrifts lingered north south east
and west spread an identical monotony of un-
familiar forms and somewhere buried among
this tangled confusion was our sphere our home
our only provision our only hope of escape from
this fantastic wilderness of ephemeral growths into
which we had come

  i think after all he said pointing suddenly
it might be over there

  no i said we have turned in a curve seef
here is the mark of my heels its clear the thing
must be more to the eastward much more no-
the sphere must be over there

  i think said cavor i kept the sun upon
my right all the time

  every leap it seems to me i said my shadow
flew before me

  we stared into one anothers eyes the area of
the crater had become enormously vast to our
imaginations the growing thickets already im-
penetrably dense

  good heavens what fools we have been

  its evident that we must find it again said
cavor and that soon the sun grows stronger
we should be fainting with the heat already if it
wasnt so dry and    im hungry

  i stared at him i had not suspected this aspect
of the matter before but it came to me at once-
a positive craving yes i said with emphasis
i am hungry too

  he stood up with a look of active resolution
certainly we must find the sphere

  as calmly as possible we surveyed the intermin-
able reefs and thickets that formed the floor of the
crater each of us weighing in silence the chances
of our finding the sphere before we were over-
taken by heat and hunger

  it cant be fifty yards from here said cavor
with indecisive gestures the only thing is to
beat round about until we come upon it

  that is all we can do i said without any
alacrity to begin our hunt i wish this confounded
spike bush did not grow so fast

  thats just it said cavor but it was lying
on a bank of snow

  i stared about me in the vain hope of recognising
some knoll or shrub that had been near the sphere
but everywhere was a confusing sameness every-
where the aspiring bushes the distending fungi
the dwindling snow banks steadily and inevitably
changed the sun scorched and stung and faint-
ness of an unaccountable hunger mingled with our
infinite perplexity and even as we stood there
confused and lost amidst unprecedented things we
became aware for the first time of a sound upon the
moon other than the stir of the growing plants
the faint sighing of the wind or those that we our-
selves had made
the first men in the moon



  boom   boom    boom   

  it came from beneath our feet a sound in the
earth we seemed to hear it with our feet as much
as with our ears its dull resonance was muffled
by distance thick with the quality of intervening
substance no sound that i can imagine could have
astonished us more or have changed more com-
pletely  the quality of things about us for this
sound rich slow and deliberate seemed to us as
though it could be nothing but the striking of
some gigantic buried clock

  boom    boom    boom   

  sound suggestive of still cloisters of sleepless
nights in crowded cities of vigils and the awaited
hour of all that is orderly and methodical in life
booming out pregnant and mysterious in this
fantastic desert to the eye everything was un-
changed  the desolation of bushes and cacti waving
silently in the wind stretched unbroken to the dis-
tant cliffs the still dark sky was empty overhead
and the hot sun hung and burned and through
it all a warning a threat throbbed this enigma
of sound

  boom    boom    boom   

  we questioned one another in faint and faded
voices a clock

  like a clock

  what is it

  what can it be

  count was cavors belated suggestion and at
that word the striking ceased

  the silence the rhythmic disappointment of the
silence came as a fresh shock for a moment one
could doubt whether one had ever heard a sound
or whether it might not still be going on had i
indeed heard a sound

  i felt the pressure of cavors hand upon my arm
he spoke in an undertone as though he feared to
wake some sleeping thing let us keep together
he whispered and look for the sphere we must
get back to the sphere this is beyond our under-
standing

  which way shall we go

  he hesitated an intense persuasion of pre-
sences of unseen things about us and near us
dominated our minds what could they be where
could they be was this arid desolation alternately
frozen and scorched only the outer rind and mask
of some subterranean world and if so what sort
of world what sort of inhabitants might it not
presently disgorge upon us	

  and then stabbing the aching stillness as vivid
and sudden as an unexpected thunderclap came a
clang and rattle as though great gates of metal
had suddenly been flung apart

  it arrested our steps we stood gaping helplessly
then cavor stole towards me

  i do not understand he whispered close to
my face he waved his hand vaguely skyward the
vague suggestion of still vaguer thoughts

  a hiding-place if anything came   

  i looked about us i nodded my head in assent
to him

  we started off moving stealthily with the most
exaggerated precautions against noise we went
towards a thicket of scrub a clangour like ham-

mers flung about a boiler hastened our steps we
must crawl whispered cavor

  the lower leaves of the bayonet plants already
overshadowed by the newer ones above were begin-
ning to wilt and shrivel so that we could thrust our
way in among the thickening stems without serious
injury a stab in the face or arm we did not
heed at the heart of the thicket i stopped and
stared panting into cavors face

  subterranean he whispered below

  they may come out

  we must find the sphere

  yes i said but how

  crawl till we come to it

  but if we dont

  keep hidden see what they are like

  we will keep together said i

  he thought which way shall we go

  we must take our chance

  we peered this way and that then very cir-
cumspectly we began to crawl through the lower
jungle making so far as we could judge a circuit
halting now at every waving fungus at every sound
intent only on the sphere from which we had so
foolishly emerged ever and again from out of
the earth beneath us came concussions beatings
strange inexplicable mechanical sounds and once
and then again we thought we heard something
a faint rattle and tumult borne to us through the
air but fearful as we were we dared essay no
vantage-point to survey the crater for long we
saw nothing of the beings whose sounds were so
abundant and insistent but for the faintness of
our hunger and the drying of our throats that
crawling would have had the quality of a very vivid
dream it was so absolutely unreal the only
element with any touch of reality was these sounds

  figure it to yourself about us the dream-like
jungle with the silent bayonet leaves darting over-
head and the silent vivid sun-splashed lichens
under our hands and knees waving with the vigour
of their growth as a carpet waves when the wind
gets beneath it ever and again one of the bladder
fungi bulging and distending under the sun loomed
upon us ever and again some novel shape in vivid
colour obtruded the very cells that built up these
plants were as large as my thumb like beads of
coloured glass and all these things were saturated
in the unmitigated glare of the sun were seen
against a sky that was bluish black and spangled
still in spite of the sunlight with a few surviving
stars strange the very forms and texture of the
stones were strange it was all strange the feeling
of ones body was unprecedented every other move-
ment ended in a surprise the breath sucked thin
in ones throat the blood flowed through ones ears
in a throbbing tide-thud thud thud thud   

  and ever and again came gusts of turmoil ham-
mering the clanging and throb of machinery and
presently-the bellowing of great beasts

chapter xi

the mooncalf pastures

so we two poor terrestrial castaways lost in
that wild-growing moon jungle crawled in
terror before the sounds that had come upon


amazing stories

us we crawled as it seemed a long time before we
saw either selenite or mooncalf though we heard
the bellowing and grunting noises of these latter
continually drawing nearer to us we crawled
through stony ravines over snow slopes amidst
fungi that ripped like thin bladders at our thrust
emitting a watery humour over a perfect pavement
of things like puff-balls and beneath interminable
thickets of scrub and ever more hopelessly our
eyes sought for our abandoned sphere the noise
of the mooncalves would at times be a vast flat
calf-like sound at times it rose to an amazed and
wrathy bellowing and again it would become a
clogged bestial sound as though these unseen crea-
tures had sought to eat and bellow at the same time

  our first view was but an inadequate transitory
glimpse yet none the less disturbing because it
was incomplete cavor was crawling in front at
the time and he was first to become aware of their
proximity pie stopped dead arresting me with
a single gesture

  a crackling and smashing of the scrub appeared
to be advancing directly upon us and then as we
squatted close and endeavoured to judge of the
nearness and direction of this noise there came a
terrific bellow behind us so close and vehement that
the tops of the bayonet scrub bent before it and
one felt the breath of it hot and moist and turn-
ing about we saw indistinctly through a crowd of
swaying stems the mooncalfs shining sides and the
long line of its back loomed out against the sky

  of course it is hard for me now to say how much
 saw at that time because my impressions were
corrected by subsequent observation first of all
impressions was its enormous size the girth rf its
body was some fourscore feet its length perhaps
two hundred its sides rose and fell  with its
laboured breathing i perceived that its gigantic
flabby body lay along the ground and that its skin
was of a corrugated white dappling into blackness
along the backbone but of its feet we saw nothing
i think also that we saw then the profile at least
of the almost brainless head with its fat-encum-
bered neck its slobbering omnivorous mouth its
little nostrils and tight shut eyes for the moon-
calf invariably shuts its eyes in the presence of the
sun we had a glimpse of a vast red pit as it
opened its mouth to bleat and bellow again we
had a breath from the pit and then the monster
heeled over like a ship dragged forward along the
ground creasing all its leathery skin rolled again
and so wallowed past us smashing a path amidst
the scrub and was speedily hidden from our eyes
by the dense interlacings beyond another appeared
more distantly and then another and then as
though he was guiding these animated lumps of
provender to their pasture a selenite came momen-
tarily into ken my grip upon cavors foot became
convulsive at the sight of him and we remained
motionless and peering long after he had passed out
of our range

  by contrast with the mooncalves he seemed a
trivial being a mere ant scarcely five feet high
he was wearing garments of some leathery sub-
stance so that no portion of his actual body ap-
peared but of this of course we were entirely

ignorant he presented himself therefore as a
compact bristling creature having much of the
quality of a complicated insect with whip-like
tentacles and a clanging arm projecting from his
shining cylindrical body case the form of his head
was hidden by his enormous many-spiked helmet-
we discovered afterwards that he used the spikes
for prodding refractory mooncalves-and a pair of
goggles of darkened glass set very much at the
side gave a bird-like quality to the metallic ap-
paratus that covered his face his arms did not
project beyond his body case and he carried him-
self upon short legs that wrapped though they
were in warm coverings seemed to our terrestrial
eyes inordinately flimsy they had very short
thighs very long shanks and little feet

  in spite of his heavy-looking clothing he was
progressing with what would be from the terres-
trial point of view very considerable strides and
his clanging arm was busy the quality of his
motion during the instant of his passing suggested
haste and a certain anger and soon after we had
lost sight of him we heard the bellow of a moon-
calf change abruptly into a short sharp squeal fol-
lowed by the scuffle of its acceleration and
gradually that bellowing receded and then came to
an end as if the pastures sought had been attained

  we listened for a space the moon world was
still but it was some time before we resumed our
crawling search for the vanished sphere

  when next we saw mooncalves they were some
little distance away from us in a place of tumbled
rocks the less vertical surfaces of the rocks were
thick with a speckled green plant growing in dense
mossy clumps upon which these creatures were
browsing we stopped at the edge of the reeds
amidst which we were crawling at the sight of
them peering out at them and looking round for a
second glimpse of a selenite they lay against
their food like stupendous slugs huge greasy hulls
eating greedily and noisily with a sort of sobbing
avidity they seemed monsters of mere fatness
clumsy and overwhelmed to a degree that would
make a smithfield ox seem a model of agility their
busy writhing chewing mouths and eyes closed
together with the appetising sound of their munch-
ing made up an effect of animal enjoyment that
was singularly stimulating to our empty frames

  hogs said cavor with unusual passion
disgusting hogs and after one glare of angry
envy crawled off through the bushes to our right
i stayed long enough to see that the speckled plant
was quite hopeless for human nourishment then
crawled after him nibbling a quill of it between my
teeth

  presently we were arrested again by the proxi-
mity of a selenite and this time we were able to
observe him more exactly now we could see that
the selenite covering was indeed clothing and not
a sort of crustacean integument he was quite
similar in his costume to the former one we had
glimpsed except that ends of something like wad-
ding were protruding from his neck and he stood
on a promontory of rock and moved his head this
way and that as though he were surveying the
crater we lay quite still fearing to attract hia
the first men in the moon



attention if we moved and after a time he turned
about and disappeared

  we came upon another drove of mooncalves bel-
lowing up a ravine and then we passed over a place
of sounds sounds of beating machinery as if some
huge hall of industry came near the surface there
and while these sounds were still about us we came
to the edge of a great open space perhaps two
hundred yards in diameter and perfectly level
save for a few lichens that advanced from its mar-
gin this space was bare and presented a powdery
surface of a dusty yellow colour we were afraid
to strike out across this space but as it presented
less obstruction to our crawling than the scrub we
went down upon it and began very circumspectly
to skirt its edge

  for a little while the noises from below ceased
and everything save for the faint stir of the grow-
ing vegetation was very still then abruptly there
began an uproar louder more vehement and nearer
than any we had so far heard of a certainty it
came from below instinctively we crouched as
flat as we could ready for a prompt plunge into the
thicket beside us each knock and throb seemed
to vibrate through our bodies louder grew this
throbbing arid beating and that irregular vibration
increased until the whole moon world seemed to be
jerking and pulsing

 cover whispered cavor and i turned towards
the bushes

  at that instant came a thud like the thud of a
gun and then a thing happened-it still haunts me
in my dreams i had turned my head to look at
cavors face and thrust out my hand in front of
me as i did so and my hand met nothing plunged
suddenly into a bottomless hole

  my chest hit something hard and i found myself
with my chin on the edge of an unfathomable abyss
that had suddenly opened beneath me my hand ex-
tended stiffly into the void the whole of that flat
circular area was no more than a gigantic lid that
was now sliding sideways from off the pit it had
covered into a slot prepared for it

  had it not been for cavor i think i should have
remained rigid hanging over this margin and star-
ing into the enormous gulf below until at last the
edges of the slot scraped me off and hurled me into
its depths but cavor had not received the shock
that had paralysed me he had been a little distance
from the edge when the lid had first opened and
perceiving the peril that held me helpless gripped
my legs and pulled me backward i came into a
sitting position crawled away from the edge for
a space on all fours then staggered up and ran after
him across the thundering quivering sheet of metal
it seemed to be swinging open with a steadily ac-
celerated velocity and the bushes in front of me
shifted sideways as i ran

  i was none too soon cavors back vanished
amidst the bristling thicket and as i scrambled up
after him the monstrous valve came into its posi-
tion with a clang for a long time we lay panting
not daring to approach the pit

  but at last very cautiously and bit by bit we
crept into a position from which we could peer
down the bushes about us creaked and waved

with the force of a breeze that was blowing down
the shaft we could see nothing at first except
smooth vertical walls descending at last into an
impenetrable black and then very gradually we
became aware of a number of very faint and little
lights going to and fro

  for a time that stupendous gulf of mystery held
us so that we forgot even our sphere in time
as we grew more accustomed to the darkness we
could make out very small dim elusive shapes mov-
ing about among those needle-point illuminations
we peered amazed and incredulous understanding
so little that we could find no words to say we
could distinguish nothing that would give us a clue
to the meaning of the faint shapes we saw

  what can it be i asked what can it be
the engineering    they must live in these
caverns during the night and come out during the
day

  cavor i said can they be-that-it was
something like-men

  that was not a man

  we dare risk nothing

  we dare do nothing until we find the sphere
we can do nothing until we find the sphere
he assented with a groan and stirred himself
to move he stared about him for a space sighed
and indicated a direction we struck out through
the jungle for a time we crawled resolutely then
with diminishing vigour presently among great
shapes of flabby purple there came a noise of tramp-
ling and cries about us we lay close and for a
long time the sounds went to and fro and very
near but this time we saw nothing i tried to
whisper to cavor that i could hardly go without
food much longer but my mouth had become too
dry for whispering

  cavor i said i must have food

  he turned a face full of dismay towards me
  its a case for holding out he said

  but i must i said and look at my lips

  ive been thirsty some time

  if only some of that snow had remained
its clean gone were driving from arctic to
tropical at the rate of a degree a minute  

  i gnawed my hand

  the sphere he said there is nothing for
it but the sphere

  we roused ourselves to another spurt of crawling
my mind ran entirely on edible things on the hiss-
ing profundity of summer drinks more particularly
i craved for beer i was haunted by the memory
of a sixteen gallon cask that had swaggered in my
lympne cellar  thought of the adjacent larder
and especially of steak and kidney pie-tender
steak and plenty of kidney and rich thick gravy
between ever and again i was seized with fits of
hungry yawning we came to flat places overgrown
with fleshy red things monstrous coralline growths
as we pushed against them they snapped and broke
i noted the quality of the broken surfaces the
confounded stuff certainly looked of a biteable
texture then it seemed to me that it smelt rather
well

  i picked up a fragment and sniffed at it
  cavor i said in a hoarse undertone


amazing stories

  he glanced at me with his face screwed up
dont he said i put down the fragment and
we crawled on through this tempting fleshiness for
a space

  cavor i asked why not

  poison i heard him say but he did not look
round

  we crawled some way before i decided

  ill chance it said i

  he made a belated gesture to prevent me i
stuffed my mouth full he crouched watching my
face his own twisted into the oddest expression
its good i said

   lord he cried

  he watched me munch his face wrinkled between
desire and disapproval then suddenly succumbed
to appetite and began to tear off huge mouthfuls
for a time we did nothing but eat

  the stuff was not unlike a terrestrial mushroom
only it was much laxer in texture and as one
swallowed it it warmed the throat at first we ex-
perienced a mere mechanical satisfaction in eating
then our blood began to run warmer and we tingled
at the lips and fingers and then new and slightly
irrelevant ideas came bubbling up in our minds

  its good said i infernally good what a
home for our surplus population our poor surplus
population and i broke off another large portion

  it filled me with a curiously benevolent satis-
faction that there was such good food in the moon
the depression of my hunger gave way to an irra-
tional exhilaration the dread and discomfort in
which i had been living vanished entirely i per-
ceived the moon no longer as a planet from which i
most earnestly desired the means of escape but as
a possible refuge for human destitution i think i
forgot the selenites the mooncalves the lid and
the noises completely so soon as i had eaten that
fungus

  cavor replied to my third repetition of my sur-
plus population remark with similar words of ap-
proval i felt that my head swam but i put this
down to the stimulating effect of food after a long
fast esslent discovry yours cavor said i
send ony to the tato

  whajer mean asked cavor scovery of the
moon-send ony to the tato

  i looked at him shocked at his suddenly hoarse
voice and by the badness of his articulation it
occurred to me in a flash that he was intoxicated
possibly by the fungus it also occurred to me that
he erred in imagining that he had discovered the
moon he had not discovered it he had only reached
it i tried to lay my hand on his arm and explain
this to him but the issue was too subtle for his
brain it was also unexpectedly difficult to express
after a momentary attempt to understand me-i
remember wondering if the fungus had made my
eyes as fishy as his-he set off upon some observa-
tions on his own account

  we are he announced with a solemn hiccup
the creashurs o what we eat and drink

  he repeated this and as i was now in one of my
subtle moods i determined to dispute it possibly
i wandered a little from the point but cavor
certainly did not attend at all properly he stood

up as well as he could putting a hand on my head
to steady himself which was disrespectful and
stood staring about him quite devoid now of any
fear of the moon beings

  i tried to point out that this was dangerous for
some reason that was not perfectly clear to me
but the word dangerous had somehow got mixed
with indiscreet and came out rather more like
injurious than either and after an attempt to
disentangle them i resumed my argument address-
ing myself principally to the unfamiliar but at-
tentive coralline growths on either side i felt that
it was necessary to clear up this confusion between
the moon and a potato at once-i wandered into a
long parenthesis on the importance of precision of
definition in argument i did my best to ignore
the fact that my bodily sensations were no longer
agreeable

  in some way that i have now forgotten my mind
was led back to projects of colonisation we must
annex this moon i said there must be no shilly-
shally this is part of the white mans burthen
cavor--we are-hie-satap-mean-s atraps
nempire caasar never dreamt bin all the news-
papers cavorecia bedfordecia bedfordecia-
hie-limited mean-unlimited practically

  certainly i was intoxicated

  i embarked upon an argument to show the infinite
benefits our arrival would confer on the moon i
involved myself in a rather difficult proof that the
arrival of columbus was on the whole beneficial
to america i found i had forgotten the line of
argument i had intended to pursue and continued
to repeat simlar to clumbus to fill up time

  from that point my memory of the action of that
abominable fungus becomes confused i remember
vaguely that we declared our intention of standing
no nonsense from any confounded insects that we
decided it ill became men to hide shamefully upon
a mere satellite that we equipped ourselves with
huge armfuls of the fungus-whether for missile
purposes or not i do not know-and heedless of the
stabs of the bayonet scrub we started forth into the
sunshine

  almost immediately we must have come upon the
selenites there were six of them and they were
marching in single file over a rocky place making
the most remarkable piping and whining sounds
they all seemed to become aware of us at once
all instantly became silent and motionless like
animals with their faces turned towards us

  for a moment i was sobered

  insects murmured cavor insects and
they think im going to crawl about on my stomach
-on my vertebrated stomach

  stomach he repeated slowly as though he
chewed the indignity

  then suddenly with a shout of fury he made
three vast strides and leapt towards them he
leapt badly he made a series of somersaults in the
air whirled right over them and vanished with an
enormous splash amidst the cactus bladders what
the selenites made of this amazing and to my mind
undignified irruption from another planet i have
no means of guessing i seem to remember the
sight of their backs as they ran in all directions
the first men in the moon



but i am not sure all these last incidents before
oblivion came are vague and faint in my mind i
know i made a step to follow cavor and tripped
and fell headlong among the rocks i was i am
certain suddenly and vehemently ill i seem to
remember a violent struggle and being gripped
by metallic clasps   

  my next clear recollection is that we were pris-
oners at we knew not what depths beneath the
moons surface we were in darkness amidst strange
distracting noises our bodies were covered with
scratches and bruises and our heads racked with
pain

chapter xii
the selenites face

i found myself sitting crouched together in a
tumultuous darkness for a long time i could
not understand where i was nor how i had
come to this perplexity i thought of the cupboard
into which i had been thrust at times when i was a
child and then of a very dark and noisy bedroom in
which i had slept during an illness but these
sounds about me were not the noises i had known
and there was a thin flavour in the air like the
wind of a stable then i supposed we must still be
at work upon the sphere and that somehow i had
got into the cellar of cavors house i remembered
we had finished the sphere and fancied i must still
be in it and travelling through space

  cavor i said cannot we have some light
  there came no answer

  cavor i insisted

  i was answered by a groan my head i
heard him say my head

  i attempted to press my hands to my brow which
ached and discovered they were tied together this
startled me very much i brought them up to my
mouth and felt the cold smoothness of metal they
were chained together i tried to separate my legs
and made out they were similarly fastened and
also that i was fastened to the ground by a much
thicker chain about the middle of my body

  i was more frightened than i had yet been by
anything in all our strange experience for a
time i tugged silently at my bonds cavor i
cried out sharply why am i tied why have
you tied me hand and xoot

  i havent tied you he answered its the
selenites

  the selenites my mind hung on that for a
space then my memories came back to me the
snowy desolation the thawing of the air the growth
of the plants our strange hopping and crawling
among the rocks and vegetation of the crater all
the distress of our frantic search for the sphere re-
turned to me    finally the opening of the great
lid that covered the pit

  then as i strained to trace our later movements
down to our present plight the pain in my head
became intolerable i came to an insurmountable
barrier an obstinate blank

  cavor

  yes

  cavor where are we do you know where we
are

  how should i know

  are we dead

  what nonsense

  theyve got us then

  he made no answer but a grunt the lingering
traces of the poison seemed to make him oddly
irritable

  what do you mean to do

  how should i know what to do

  oh very well said i and became silent pres-
ently i was roused from a stupor  lordv i
cried i wish youd stop that buzzing

   we lapsed into silence again listening to the dull
confusion of noises like the muffled sounds of a
street or factory that filled our ears i could make
nothing of it my mind pursued first one rhythm
and then another and questioned it in vain but
after a long time i became aware of a new and
sharper element not mingling with the rest but
standing out as it were against that cloudy back-
ground of sound it was a series of relatively very
little definite sounds tappings and rubbings like
a loose spray of ivy against a window or a bird
moving about upon a box we listened and peered
about us but the darkness was a velvet pall there
followed a noise like the subtle movement of the
wards of a well-oiled lock and then there appeared
before me hanging as it seemed in an immensity
of black a thin bright line

  look whispered cavor very softly

  what is it

  i dont know

  we stared

  the thin bright line became a band and broader
and paler it took upon itself the quality of a
bluish light falling upon a white-washed wall it
ceased to be parallel-sided it developed a deep
indentation on one side i turned to remark this
to cavor and was amazed to see his ear in a
brilliant illumination-all the rest of him in
shadow i twisted my head round as well as my
bonds would permit cavor i said its behind
his ear vanished-gave place to an eye

  suddenly the crack that had been admitting the
light broadened out and revealed itself as the space
of an opening door beyond was a sapphire vista
and in the doorway stood a grotesque outline
silhouetted against the glare

  we both made convulsive efforts to turn and
failing sat staring over our shoulders at this
my first impression was of some clumsy quadruped
with lowered head then i perceived it was the
slender pinched body and short and extremely
attenuated bandy legs of a selenite with his head
depressed between his shoulders he was without
the helmet and body covering they wear when upon
the exterior of the satellite

  he was a blank black figure to us but instinc-
tively our imaginations supplied features to his
very human outline i at least took it instantly
that he was somewhat hunchbacked with a high
forehead and long features

  he came forward three steps and paused for a
time his movements seemed absolutely noiseless


amazing stories

then he came forward again he walked like a
bird his feet fell one in front of the other he
stepped out of the ray of light that came through
the doorway and it seemed as though he vanished
altogether in the shadow

  for a moment my eyes sought him in the wrong
place and then i perceived him standing facing us
both in the full light only the human features i
had attributed to him were not there at all

  of course i ought to have expected that only i
didnt it came to me as an absolute for a moment
an overwhelming shock it seemed as theugh it
wasnt a face as though it must needs be a mask
a horror a deformity that would presently be dis-
avowed or explained there was no nose and the
thing had dull bulging eyes at the side-in the
silhouette i had supposed they were ears there
were no ears  i have tried to draw one of these
heads but i cannot there was a mouth down-
wardly curved like a human mouth in a face that
stares ferociously   

  the neck on which the head was poised was
jointed in three places almost like the short joints
in the leg of a crab the joints of the limbs i
could not see because of the puttee-like straps in
which they were swathed and which formed the
only clothing the being wore

  there the thing was looking at us

  at the time my mind was taken up by the mad
impossibility of the creature i suppose he also
was amazed and with more reason perhaps for
amazement than we only confound him he did
not show jt we did at least know what had brought
about this meeting of incompatible creatures
but conceive how it would seem to decent lon-
doners for example to come upon a couple of liv-
ing things as big as men and absolutely unlike any
other earthly animals careering about among the
sheep in hyde park it must have taken him like
that

  figure us we were bound hand and foot fag-
ged and filthy our beards two inches long our
faces scratched and bloody cavor you must imagine
in his knickerbockers torn in several places by
the bayonet scrub his jaeger shirt and old cricket
cap his wiry hair wildly disordered a tail to every
quarter of the heavens in that blue light his
face did not look red but very dark his lips and
the drying blood upon my hands seemed black
tf possible i was in a worse plight than he on ac-
count of the yellow fungus into which i had jumped
our jackets were unbuttoned and our shoes had
been taken off and lay at our feet and we were
sitting with our backs to this queer bluish light
peering at such a monster as diirer might have in-
vented

  cavor broke the silence started to speak went
hoarse and cleared his throat outside began a
terrific bellowing as if a mooncalf were in trouble
it ended in a shriek and everything was still again

  presently the selenite turned about flickered
into the shadow stood for a moment retrospective
at the door and then closed it on us and once more
we were in that murmurous mystery of darkness
into which we had awakened

chapter xiii

mr cavor makes some suggestions

 for a time neither of us spoke to focus to-
 gether all the things we had brought upon our-
 selves seemed beyond my mental powers
 theyve got us i said at last

 it was that fungus

 well-if i hadnt taken it we should have fainted
 and starved

 we might have found the sphere

 i lost my temper at his persistence and swore to
 myself for a time we hated one another in silence
 i drummed with my fingers on the floor between my
 knees and gritted the links of my fetters together
 presently i was forced to talk again

 what do you make of it anyhow i asked
 humbly

 they are reasonable creatures-they can make
 things and do things-those lights we saw  

 he stopped it was clear he could make nothing
 of it

 when he spoke again it was to confess after
 all they are more human than we had a right to

 expect i suppose-

 he stopped irritatingly

 yes

 i suppose anyhow-on any planet where there
 is an intelligent animal-it will cafry its brain case
 upward and have hands and walk erect   
 presently he broke away in another direction
 we are some way in he said i mean-per-
 haps a couple of thousand feet or more

 why

 its cooler and our voices are so much louder
 that faded quality-it has altogether gone and
 the feeling in ones ears and throat

 i had not noted that but i did now

 the air is denser we must be some depths-
 a mile even we may be-inside the moon

 we never thought of a world inside the moon
 no

 how could we

 we might have done only- one gets into

 habits of mind

 he thought for a time

 now he said it seems such an obvious thing
 of course the moon must be enormously
 cavernous with an atmosphere within and at the
 centre of its caverns a sea

 one knew that the moon had a lower specific
 gravity than the earth one knew that it had little
 air or water outside one knew too that it was
 sister planet to the earth and that it was unac-
 countable that it should be different in composition
 the inference that it was hollowed out was as clear
 as day and yet one never saw it as a fact kepler

 of course-

 his voice had the interest now of a man who has
 discovered a pretty sequence of reasoning

 yes he said kepler with his sub-volvarii was
 right after all

 i wish yu had taken the trouble to find that
 out before we came i said

 he answered nothing buzzing to himself softly
 as he pursued his thoughts my temper was going
the first men in the moon



what do you think has become of the sphere any-
how i asked

  lost he said like a man who answers an
uninteresting question

  among those plants

  unless they find it

  and then

  how can i tell

  cavor i said with a sort of hysterical bitter-
ness things look bright for my company   
he made no answer

  good lord i exclaimed just think of all
the trouble we took to get into this pickle what
did we come for what are we after what was
the moon to us or we to the moon we wanted too
much we tried too much we ought to have started
the little things first it was you proposed the
moon those cavorite spring blinds i am cer-
tain we could have worked them for terrestrial pur-
poses certain did you really understand what i

proposed a steel cylinder-

  rubbish said cavor

  we ceased to converse

  for a time cavor kept up a broken monologue
without much help from me

  if they find it he began if they find it   
what will they do with it well thats a question

  it may be thats the question they wont under-
stand it anyhow if they understood that sort of
thing they would have come long since to the earth
would they why shouldnt they but they

would have sent something- they couldnt

keep their hands off such a possibility no but
they will examine it clearly they are intelligent
and inquisitive they will examine it-get inside
it-trifle with the studs off    that would
mean the moon for us for all the rest of our lives
strange creatures strange knowledge   

 as for strange knowledge- said i and

language failed me

  look here bedford said cavor you came on
this expedition of your own free will

  you said to me call it prospecting 

  theres always risks in prospecting
especially when you do it unarmed and without
thinking out every possibility

  i was so taken up with the sphere the thing
rushed on us and carried us away

  rushed on me you mean

  rushed on me just as much how was i to know
when i set to work on molecular physics that the
business would bring me here-of all places

  its this accursed science i cried its the
very devil the mfediseval priests and persecutors
were right and the moderns are all wrong you
tamper with it-and it offers you gifts and
directly you take them it knocks you to pieces in
some unexpected way old passions and new
weapons-now it upsets your religion now it up-
sets your social ideas now it whirls you off to
desolation and misery

  anyhow its no use your quarrelling with me
now these creatures-these selenites or whatever
we choose to call them-have got us tied hand and
foot in whatever temper you choose to go through
with it you will have to go through with it

   we have experiences before us that will need
all our coolness

  he paused as if he required my assent but i
sat sulking confound your science i said

  the problem is communication gestures i
fear will be different pointing for example no
creatures but men and monkeys point

  that was too obviously wrong for me pretty
nearly every animal i cried points with its
eyes or nose

  cavor meditated over that yes he said at
last and we dont theres such differences-such
differences

  one might    but how can i tell there
is speech the sounds they make a sort of fluting
and piping i dont see how we are to imitate that
is it their speech that sort of thing they may
have different senses different means of com-
munication of course they are minds and we are
minds there must be something in common who
knows how far we may not get to an understand-
ing

  the things are outside us i said theyre
more different from us than the strangest animals
on earth they are a different clay what is the
good of talking like this

  cavor thought i dont see that where there
are minds they will have something similar-even
though they have been evolved on different planets
of course if it was a question of instincts if we or
they are no more than animals-

  well are they theyre much more like ants
on their hind legs than human beings and who ever
got to any sort of understanding with ants

  but these machines and clothing no i dont

hold with you bedford the difference is wide-

  its insurmountable

  the resemblance must bridge it i remember
reading a paper once by the late professor galton
on the possibility of communication between the
planets unhappily at that time it did not seem
probable that that would be of any material benefit
to me and i fear i did not give it the attention 
should have done-in view of this state of affairs
yet    now let me see

  his idea was to begin with those broad truths
that must underlie all conceivable mental existences
and establish a basis on those the great principles
of geometry to begin with he proposed to take
some leading proposition of euclids and show by
construction that its truth was known to us to
demonstrate for example that the angles at the
base of an isosceles triangle are equal and that if
the equal sides be produced the angles on the other
sides of the base are equal also or that the square
on the hypotenuse of a right-angle triangle is equal
to the sum of the squares on the two other sides
by demonstrating our knowledge of these things
we should demonstrate our possession of a reason-
able intelligence    now suppose i  i
might draw the geometrical figure with a wet finger
or even trace it in the air   

  he fell silent i sat meditating his words for
a time his wild hope of communication of inter-
pretation with these weird beings held me then
that angry despair that was a part of my exhaustion


amazing stories

and physical misery resumed its sway i perceived
with a sudden novel vividness the extraordinary
folly of everything i had ever done ass i said
oh ass unutterable ass  i seem to exist only
to go about doing preposterous things why did
we ever leave the thing    hopping about look-
ing for patents and concessions in the craters of
the moon  if only we had had the sense to
fasten a handkerchief to a stick to show where we
had left the sphere

  i subsided fuming

  it is clear meditated cavor they are intel-
ligent one can hypothesize certain things as
they have not killed us at once they must have
ideas of mercy mercy at any rate of restraint
possibly of intercourse they may meet us and
this apartment and the glimpses we had of its
guardian these fetters a high degree of intelli-
gence   

  i wish to heaven cried i id thought even
twice plunge after plunge first one fluky start
and then another it was my confidence in you
why didnt i stick to my play- that was what
i was equal to that was my world and the life i
was made for i could have finished that play
im certain  it was a good play i had the
scenario as good as done then    conceive it
leaping to the moon practically-ive thrown my
life away that old woman in the inn near canter-
bury had better sense than-

  i looked up and stopped in mid-sentence the
darkness had given place to that bluish light again
the door was opening and several noiseless sele-
nites were coming into the chamber i became
quite still staring at their grotesque faces

  then suddenly my sense of disagreeable strange-
ness changed to interest i perceived that the
foremost and second carried bowls one elemental
need at least our minds could understand in com-
mon they were bowls of some metal that like our
fetters looked dark in that bluish light and each
contained a number of whitish fragments all the
cloudy pain and misery that oppressed me rushed
together and took the shape of hunger i eyed these
bowls wolfishly and though it returned to me in
dreams at that time it seemed a small matter that
at the end of the arms that lowered one towards me
were not hands but a sort of flap and thumb like
the end of an elephants trunk

  the stuff in the bowl was loose in texture and
whitish brown in colour-rather like lumps of some
cold souffls and it smelt faintly like mushrooms
from a partially divided carcass of a mooncalf that
we presently saw i am inclined to believe it must
have been mooncalf flesh

  my hands were so tightly chained that i could
barely contrive to reach the bowl but when they
saw the effort i made two of them dexterously
released one of the turns about my wrist their
tentacle hands were soft and cold to my skin i
immediately seized a mouthful of the food it
had the same laxness in texture that all organic
structures seem to have upon the moon it tasted
rather like a gauffer or a damp meringue but in
no way was it disagreeable i took two other

mouthfuls i wanted-foo said i tearing off
a still larger piece   

  for a time we ate with an utter absence of self-
consciousness we ate and presently drank like
tramps in a soup kitchen never before nor since
have i been hungry to the ravenous pitch and save
that i have had this very experience i could never
have believed that a quarter of a million of miles
out of our proper world in utter perplexity of soul
surrounded watched touched by beings more
grotesque and inhuman than the worst creations
of a nightmare it would be possible for me to eat
in utter forgetfulness of all these things they
stood about us watching us and ever and again
making a slight elusive twittering that stood them
i suppose in the stead of speech i did not even
shiver at their touch and when the first zeal of
my feeding was over i could note that cavor
too had been eating with the same shameless
abandon

chapter xiv

experiments in intercourse

when at last we had made an end of eating
the selenites linked our hands closely to-
gether again and then untwisted the
chains about our feet and rebound them so as to
give us a limited freedom of movement then they
unfastened the chains about our waists to do all
this they had to handle us freely and ever and again
one of their queer heads came down close to my
face or a soft tentacle-hand touched my head or
neck i dont remember that i was afraid then or
repelled by their proximity i think that our in-
curable anthropomorphism made us imagine there
were human heads inside their masks the skin
like everything else looked bluish but that was on
account of the light and it was hard and shiny
quite in the beetle-wing fashion not soft or moist
or hairy as a vertebrated animals would be along
the crest of the head was a low ridge of whitish
spines running from back to front and a much
larger ridge curved on either side over the eyes
the selenite who untied me used his mouth to
help his hands

  they seem to be releasing us said cavor
remember we are on the moon make no sudden
movements

  are you going to try that geometry

  if i get a chance but of course they may
make an advance first

  we remained passive and the selenites having
finished their arrangements stood back from us
and seemed to be looking at us i say seemed to
be because as their eyes were at the side and not in
front one had the same difficulty in determining
the direction in which they were looking as one has
in the case of a hen or a fish they conversed with
one another in their reedy tones that seemed to me
impossible to imitate or define the door behind us
opened wider and glancing over my shouwpr i
saw a vague large space beyond in which quite a
little crowd of selenites were standing they
seemed a curiously miscellaneous rabble
the first men in the moon



  do they want us to imitate those sounds i
asked cavor

   i dont think so he said

  it seems to me that they are trying to make us
understand something

  i cant make anything of their gestures do
you notice this one who is worrying with his head
like a man with an uncomfortable collar

  let us shake our heads at him

   we did that and finding it ineffectual attempted
an imitation of the selenites movements that
seemed to interest them at any rate they all set
up the same movement but as that seemed to
lead to nothing we desisted at last and so did they
and fell into a piping argument among themselves
then one of them shorter and very much thicker
than the others and with a particularly wide
mouth squatted down suddenly beside cavor and
put his hands and feet in the same posture as
cavors were bound and then by a dexterous move-
ment stood up

  cavor i shouted they want us to get up
he stared open-mouthed thats it he said
and with much heaving and grunting because
our hands were tied together we contrived to
struggle to our feet the selenites made way for
our elephantine heavings and seemed to twitter
more volubly as soon as we were on our feet the
thick-set selenite came and patted each of our faces
with his tentacles and walked towards the open
doorway that also was plain enough and we
followed him we saw that four of the selenites
standing in the doorway were much taller than the
others and clothed in the same manner as those
we had seen in the crater namely with spiked
round helmets and cylindrical body-cases and that
each of the four carried a goad with spike and
guard made of that same dull-looking metal as the
bowls these four closed about us one on either
side of each of us as we emerged from our chamber
into the cavern from which the light had come

   we did not get our impression of that cavern all
at once our attention was taken up by the move-
ments and attitudes of the selenites immediately
about us and by the necessity of controlling our
motion lest we should startle and alarm them and
ourselves by some excessive stride in front of us
was the short thick-set being who had solved the
problem of asking us to get up moving with
gestures that seemed almost all of them intelligible
to us inviting us to follow him his spout-like
face turned from one of us to the other with a
quickness that was clearly interrogative for a
time i say we were taken up with these things

  but at last the great place that formed a back-
ground to our movements asserted itself it be-
came apparent that the source of much at least of
the tumult of sounds which had filled our ears ever
since we had recovered from the stupefaction of
the fungus was a vast mass of machinery in active
movement whose flying and whirling parts were
visible indistinctly over the heads and between the
bodies of the selenites who walked about us and
not only did the web of sounds that filled the air
proceed from this mechanism but also the peculiar
blue light that irradiated the whole place we had

taken it as a natural thing that a subterranean
cavern should be artificially lit and even now
though the fact was patent to my eyes i did not
really grasp its import until presently the darkness
came the meaning and structure of this huge
apparatus we saw i cannot explain because we
neither of us learnt what it was for or how it
worked one after another big shafts of metal
flung out and up from its centre their heads travel-
ling in what seemed to me to be a parabolic path
each dropped a sort of dangling arm as it rose to-
wards the apex of its flight and plunged down into
a vertical cylinder forcing this down before it
about it moved the shapes of tenders little figures
that seemed vaguely different from the beings
about us as each of the three dangling arms of
the machine plunged down there was a clank and
then a roaring and out of the top of the vertical
cylinder came pouring this incandescent substance
that lit the place and ran over as milk runs over
a boiling pot and dripped luminously into a tank of
light below it was a cold blue light a sort of
phosphorescent glow but infinitely brighter and
from the tanks into which it fell it ran in conduits
athwart the cavern

  thud thud thud thud came the sweeping arms
of this unintelligible apparatus and the light sub-
stance hissed and poured at first the thing
seemed only reasonably large and near to us and
then i saw how exceedingly little the selenites upon
it seemed and i realized the full immensity of
cavern and machine i looked from this tremendous
affair to the faces of the selenites with a new re-
spect i stopped and cavor stopped and stared at
this thunderous engine

  but this is stupendous i said what can
it be for

  cavors blue-lit face was full of an intelligent

respect i cant dream surely these beings-

men could not make a thing like that look at
those arms are they on connecting rods

  the thick-set selenite had gone some paces un-
heeded he came back and stood between us and
the great machine i avoided seeing him because
i guessed somehow that his idea was to beckon
us onward he walked away in the direction he
wished us to go and turned and came back and
flicked our faces to attract our attention

  cavor and i looked at one another

  cannot we show him we are interested in the
machine i said

  yes said cavor well try that he turned
to our guide and smiled and pointed to the machine
and pointed again and then to his head and then
to the machine by some defect of reasoning he
seemed to imagine that broken english might help
these gestures me look im he said me think
im very much yes

  his behaviour seemed to check the selenites in
their desire for our progress for a moment they
faced one another their queer heads moved the
twittering voices came quick and liquid then one
of them a lean tall creature with a sort of mantle
added to the puttee in which the others were
dressed twisted his elephant trunk of a hand about


amazing stories

cavors waist and pulled him gently to follow our
guide who again went on ahead

  cavor resisted we may just as well begin ex-
plaining ourselves now they may think we are
new animals a new sort of mooncalf perhaps it
is most important that we should show an intelli-
gent interest from the outset

  he began to shake his head violently no no
he said me not come on one minute me look at
im

  isnt there some geometrical point you might
bring in apropos of that affair i suggested as
the selenites conferred again

  possibly a parabolic- he began

  he yelled loudly and leaped six feet or more

  one of the four armed moon-men had pricked
him with a goad

  i turned on the goad-bearer behind me with a
swift threatening gesture and he started back
this and cavors sudden shout and leap clearly
astonished all the selenites they receded hastily
facing us for one of those moments that seem
to last for ever we stood in angry protest with a
scattered semicircle of these inhuman beings about
us

  he pricked me said cavor with a catching
of the voice

  i saw him i answered

  confound it i said to the selenites were
not going to stand that what on earth do you take
us for

  i glanced quickly right and left far away across
the blue wilderness of cavern i saw a number of
other selenites running towards us broad and
slender they were and one with a larger head than
the others the cavern spread wide and low and
receded in every direction into darkness its roof
i remember seemed to bulge down as if with the
weight of the vast thickness of rocks that prisoned
us there was no way out of it-no way out of it
above below in every direction was the unknown
and these inhuman creatures with goads and
gestures confronting us and we two unsupported
men

chapter xv

the giddy bridge

just for a moment that hostile pause endured
i suppose that both we and the selenites did
some very rapid thinking my clearest impres-
sion was that there was nothing to put my back
against and that we were bound to be surrounded
and killed the overwhelming folly of our presence
there loomed over me in black enormous reproach
why had i ever launched myself on this mad in-
human expedition

  cavor came to my side and laid his hand on my
arm his pale and terrified face was ghastly in
the blue light

  we cant do anything he said its a mistake
they dont understand we must go as they
want us to go

  i looked down at him and then at the fresh
selenites who were coming to help their fellows
if i had my hands free--

  its no use he panted its absolutely no use

  no

  well go

  and he turned about and led the way in the
direction that had been indicated for us

  i followed trying to look as subdued as possible
and feeling at the chains about my wrists my
blood was boiling i noted nothing more of that
cavern though it seemed to take a long time before
we had marched across it or if i noted anything i
forgot it as i saw it my thoughts were concen-
trated i think upon my chains and the selenites
and particularly upon the helmeted ones with the
goads at first they marched parallel with us and
at a respectful distance but presently they were
overtaken by three others and then they drew
nearer until they were within arms length again
i winced like a beaten horse as they came near to
us the shorter thicker selenite marched at first
on our right flank but presently came in front of us
again

  how well the picture of that grouping has bitten
into my brain the back of cavors downcast head
just in front of me and the dejected droop of his
shoulders and our guides gaping visage per-
petually jerking about him and the goad-bearers on
either side watchful yet open-mouthed-a blue
monochrome and after all i do remember one
other thing besides the purely personal affair which
is that a sort of gutter came presently across the
floor of the cavern and then ran along by the side
of the path of rock we followed and it was full of
that same bright blue luminous stuff that flowed
out of the great machine i walked close beside
it and i can testify it radiated not a particle of
heat it was brightly shining and yet it was neither
warmer nor colder than anything else in the cavern

  clang clang clang we passed right under the
thumping levers of another vast machine and so
came at last to a wide tunnel in which we could
even hear the pad pad of our shoeless feet and
which save for the trickling thread of blue to the
right of us was quite unlit the shadows made
gigantic travesties of our shapes and those of the
selenites on the irregular wall and roof of the tun-
nel ever and again crystals in the walls of the
tunnel scintillated like gems ever and again the
tunnel expanded into a stalactitic cavern or gave
off branches that vanished into darkness

  we seemed to be marching down that tunnel for
a long time trickle trickle went the flowing
light very softly and our footfalls and their echoes
made an irregular paddle paddle my mind settled
down to the question of my chains if i were to
slip off one turn so and then totwist it so  

  if i tried to do it very gradually would they see
i was slipping my wrist out of the looser turn
if they did what would they do

  bedford said cavor it goes down it keeps
on going down

  his remark roused me from my sullen pre-
occupation

  if they wanted to kill us he said dropping
back to come level with me there is no reason
why they should not have done it

  no i admitted thats true
the first men in the moon



they dont understand us he said they think
we are merely strange animals some wild sort of
mooncalf birth perhaps it will be only when they
have observed us better that they will begin to

think we have minds-

when you trace those geometrical problems
said i

it may be that

we tramped on for a space

you see said cavor these may be selenites
of a lower class

the infernal fools said i viciously glancing
at their exasperating faces

if we endure what they do to us-r-

weve got to endure it said i

there may be others less stupid this is the
mere outer fringe of their world it must go down
and down cavern passage tunnel down at last
to the sea-hundreds of miles below

his words made me think of the mile or so of
rock and tunnel that might be over our heads al-
ready it was like a weight dropping on my
shoulders away from the sun and air i said
even a mine half a mile deep is stuffy

this is not anyhow its probable-ven-
tilation the air would blow from the dark side
of the moon to the sunlit and all the carbonic acid
gas would well out there and feed those plants up
this tunnel for example there is quite a breeze
and what a world it must be the earnest we have

in that shaft and those machines-

and the goad i said dont forget the goad
he walked a little in front of me for a time

even that goad- he said

well

i was angry at the time butr it was
perhaps necessary we should get on they have
different skins and probably different nerves they

may not understand our objection- just as

a being from mars might not like our earthly habit

of nudging-

theyd better be careful how they nudge me
and about that geometry after all their way
is a way of understanding too they begin with
the elements of life and not of thought food
compulsion pain they strike at fundamentals
theres  doubt about that i said

he went on to talk of the enormous and wonderful
world into which we were being taken i realised
slowly from his tone that even now he was not
absolutely in despair at the prospect of going ever
deeper into this inhuman planet-burrow his mind
ran on machines and invention to the exclusion of
a thousand dark things that beset me it wasnt
that he intended to make any use of these things he
simply wanted to know them

after all he said this is a tremendous oc-
casion it is the meeting of two worlds what are
we going to see think of what is below us here
we shant see much if the light isnt better
i remarked

this is only the outer crust down below-

on this scale- there will be everything do

you notice how different they seem one from an-
other the story we shall take back

some rare sort of animal i said might com

fort himself in that way while they were bringing
him to the zoo  it doesnt follow that we are
going to be shown all these things

  when they find we have reasonable minds
said cavor they will want to learn about the
earth even if they have no generous emotions
they will teach in order to learn    and the
things they must know the unanticipated things

  he went on to speculate on the possibility of
their knowing things he had never hoped to learn
on earth speculating in that way with a raw wound
from that goad already in his skin much that
he said i forget for my attention was drawn to
the fact that the tunnel along which we had been
marching was opening out wider and wider we
seemed from the feeling of the air to be going out
into a huge space but how big the space might
really be we could not tell because it was unlit
our little stream of light ran in a dwindling thread
and vanished far ahead presently the rocky walls
had vanished altogether on either hand there was
nothing to be seen but the path in front of us and
the trickling hurrying rivulet of blue phosphores-
cence the figures of cavor and the guiding sele-
nite marched before me the sides of their legs
and heads that were towards the rivulet were clear
and bright blue their darkened sides now that the
reflection of the tunnel wall no longer lit them
merged indistinguishably in the darkness beyond

  and soon i perceived that we were approaching
a declivity of some sort because the little blue
stream dipped suddenly out of sight

  in another moment as it seemed we had reached
the edge the shining stream gave one meander of
hesitation and then rushed over it fell to a depth
at which the sound of its descent was absolutely
lost to us far below was a bluish glow a sort
of blue mist-at an infinite distance below and
the darkness the stream dropped out of became
utterly void and black save that a thing like a plank
projected from the edge of the cliff and stretched
out and faded and vanished altogether there was
a warm air blowing up out of the gulf

  for a moment i and cavor stood as near the
edge as we dared peering into a blue-tinged pro-
fundity and then our guide was pulling at my
arm

  then he left me and walked to the end of that
plank and stepped upon it looking back then
when he perceived we watched him he turned
about and went on along it walking as surely as
though he was on firm earth for a moment his
form was distinct then he became a blue blur and
then vanished into the obscurity i became aware
of some vague shape looming darkly out of the
black

  there was a pause surely-- said cavor

  one of the other selenites walked a few paces
out upon the plank and turned and looked back at
us unconcernedly the others stood ready to fol-
low after us our guides expectant figure reap-
peared he was returning to see why we bad not
advanced

  what is that beyond there i asked

  i cant see

  we cant cross this at any price said i
	amazing stories

  i could not go three steps on it said cavor
even with my hands free

  we looked at each others drawn faces in blank
consternation

  they cant know what it is to be giddy said
cavor

its quite impossible for us to walk that plank
i dont believe they see as we do ive been
watching them i wonder if they know this is
simply blackness for us how can we make them
understand

  anyhow we must make them understand

  i think we said these things with a vague half
hope the selenites might somehow understand i
knew quite clearly that all that was needed was
an explanation then as i saw their faces i
realised that an explanation was impossible just
here it was that our resemblances were not going to
bridge our differences well i wasnt going to walk
the plank anyhow i slipped my wrist very quickly
out of the coil of chain that was loose and then
began to twist my wrists in opposite directions i
was standing nearest to the bridge and as i did
this two of the selenites laid hold of me and pulled
me gently towards it

  i shook my head violently no go i said
no use you dont understand

  another selenite added his compulsion i was
forced to step forward

  ive got an idea said cavor but i knew his
ideas

  look here i exclaimed to the selenites

steady on its all very well for you-

  i sprang round upon my heel i burst out into
curses for one of the armed selenites had btabbed
me behind with his goad

  i wrenched my wrists free from the little tentacles
that held them i turned on the goad-bearer
confound you i cried ive warned you of
that what on earth do you think im made of
to stick that into me if you touch me again--
by way of answer he pricked me forthwith

  i heard cavors voice in alarm and entreaty
even then i think he wanted to compromise with
these creatures i aay bedford he cried i
know a way but the sting of that second stab
seemed to set free some pent-up reserve of energy
in my being instantly the link of the wrist-chain
snapped and with it snapped all considerations
that had held us unresisting in the hands of these
moon creatures for that second at least i was
mad with fear and anger i took no thought of
consequences i hit straight out at the face of the
thing with the goad the chain was twisted round
my fist   

  there came another of these beastly surprises
of which the moon world is full

  my mailed hand seemed to go clean through him
he smashed like-like some softish sort of sweet
with liquid in it he broke right in he squelched
and splashed it was like hitting a damp toadstool
the flimsy body went spinning a dozen yards and
fell with a flabby impact i was astonished i
was incredulous that any living thing could be so
flimsy for an instant i could have believed the
whole thing a dream

  then it had become real and imminent again
neither cavor nor the other selenites seemed to
have done anything from the time when i had
turned about to the time when the dead selenite
hit the ground every one stood back from us two
every one alert that arrest seemed to last at
least a second after the selenite was down every
one must have been taking the thing in i seem
to remember myself standing with my arm half
retracted trying also to take it in what next
clamoured my brain what next then in a
moment every one was moving

  i perceived we must get our chains loose and
that before we could do this these selenites had
to be beaten off i faced towards the group of
the three goad-bearers instantly one threw his
goad at me it swished over my head and i sup-
pose went flying into the abyss behind

  i leaped right at him with all my might as the
goad flew over me he turned to run as i jumped
and i bore him to the ground came down right
upon him and slipped upon his smashed body and
fell he seemed to wriggle under my foot

  i came into a sitting position and on every hand
the blue backs of the selenites were receding into
the darkness i bent a link by main force and
untwisted the chain that had hampered me about
the ankles and sprang to my feet with the chain in
my hand another goad flung javelin-wise whistled
by me and i made a rush towards the darkness
out of which it had come then i turned back
towards cavor who was still standing in the light
of the rivulet near the gulf convulsively busy with
his wrists and at the same time jabbering nonsense
about his idea

  come on i cried

  my hands he answered

  then realising that i dared not run back to him
because my ill-calculated steps might carry me
over the edge he came shuffling towards me with
his hands held out before him

  i gripped his chains at once to unfasten them

  where are they he panted

  run away theyll come back theyre throw-
ing things which way shall we go

  by the light to that tunnel eh

  yes said i and his hands were free

  i dropped on my knees and fell to work on his
ankle bonds whack came something-i know not
what-and splashed the livid streamlet into drops
about us far away on our right a piping and
whistling began

  i whipped the chain off his feet and put it in
his hand hit with that i said and without
waiting for an answer set off in big bounds along
the path by which we had come i had a nasty
sort of feeling that these things could jump out of
the darkness on to my back i heard the impact
of his leaps come following after me

  we ran in vast strides but that running you
must understand was an altogether different thing
from any running on earth on earth one leaps
and almost instantly hits the ground again but
on the moon because of its weaker pull one shot
through the air for several seconds before one came
to earth in spite of our violent hurry this gave an
the first men in the moon



effect of long pauses pauses in which one might
have counted seven or eight step and one
soared off all sorts of questions ran through my
mind where are the selenites what will they
do shall we ever get to that tunnel is cavor
far behind are they likely to cut him off then
whack stride and off again for another step

  i saw a selenite running in front of me his legs
going exactly as a mans would go on earth saw
him glance over his shoulder and heard him shriek
as he ran aside out of my way into the darkness
he was i think our guide but i am not sure then
in another vast stride the walls of rock had come
into view on either hand and in two more strides
i was in the tunnel and tempering my pace to its
low roof i went on to a bend then stopped and
turned back and plug plug plug cavor came into
view splashing into the stream of blue light at
every stride and grew larger and blundered into
me we stood clutching each other for a moment
at least we had shaken off our captors and were
alone

  we were both very much out of breath we
spoke in panting broken sentences

  youve spoilt it all panted cavor

  nonsense i cried it was that or death
  what are we to do

  hide

  how can we

  its dark enough

  but where

  up one of these side caverns

  and then

  think

  right-come on

  we strode on and presently came to a radiating
dark cavern cavor was in front he hesitated
and chose a black mouth that seemed to promise
good hiding he went towards it and turned

  its dark he said

  your legs and feet will light us youre wet
with that luminous stuff

 but-

  a tumult of sounds and in particular a sound
like a clanging gong advancing up the main tunnel
became audible it was horribly suggestive of a
tumultuous pursuit we made a bolt for the unlit
side cavern forthwith as we ran along it our way
was lit by the irradiation of cavors legs its
lucky i panted they took off our boots or we
should fill this place with clatter on we rushed
taking as small steps as we could to avoid striking
the roof of the cavern after a time we seemed
to be gaining on the uproar it became muffled it
dwindled it died away

  i stopped and looked back and i heard the pad
pad of cavors feet receding then he stopped also
bedford he whispered theres a sort of light
in front of us

  i looked and at first could see nothing then i
perceived his head and shoulders dimly outlined
against a fainter darkness i saw also that this
mitigation of the darkness was not blue as all the
other light within the moon had been but a pallid
gray a very vague faint white the daylight colour
cavor noted this difference as soon or sooner than

i did and i think too that it filled him with much
the same wild hope

  bedford he whispered and his voice trembled

that light-it is possible-

  he did not dare to say the thing he hoped then
came a pause suddenly i knew by the sound of
his feet that he was striding towards that pallor
i followed him with a beating heart

chhapter xvi

points of view

the light grew stronger as we advanced in
a little time it was nearly as strong as the
phosphorescence on cavors legs our tunnel
was expanding into a cavern and this new light
was at the farther end of it i perceived something
that set my hopes leaping and bounding

  cavor i said it comes from above i am
certain it comes from above

  he made no answer but hurried on

  indisputably it was a gray light a silvery light
in another moment we were beneath it it
filtered down through a chink in the walls of the
cavern and as i stared up drip came a drop of
water upon my face i started and stood aside-
drip fell another drop quite audibly on the rocky
floor

  cavor i said if one of us lifts the other he
can reach that crack

  ill lift you he said and incontinently hoisted
me as though i was a baby

  i thrust an arm into the crack and just at my
finger tips found a little ledge by which i could
hold i could see the white light was very much
brighter now i pulled myself up by two fingers
with scarcely an effort though on earth i weigh
twelve stone reached to a still higher corner of
rock and so got my feet on the narrow ledge i
stood up and searched up the rocks with my fingers
the cleft broadened out upwardly its climb-
able i said to cavor can you jump up to my
hand if i hold it down to you

  i wedged myself between the sides of the cleft
rested knee and foot on the ledge and extended a
hand i could not see cavor but i could hear the
rustle of his movements as he crouched to spring
then whack and he was hanging to my arm-and
no heavier than a kitten i lugged him up until
he had a hand on my ledge and could release me

  confound it i said any one could be a
mountaineer on the moon and so set myself in
earnest to the climbing for a few minutes i
clambered steadily and then i looked up again
the cleft opened out steadily and the light was

brighter only-

  it was not daylight after all

  in another moment i could see what it was and
at the sight i could have beaten my head against
the rocks with disappointment for i beheld
simply an irregularly sloping open space and all
over its slanting floor stood a forest of little club-
shaped fungi each shining gloriously with that
pinkish silvery light for a moment i stared at
their soft radiance then sprang forward and up-
ward among them i plucked up half a dozen and


amazing stories

flung them against the rocks and then sat down
laughing bitterly as cavors ruddy face came into
view

its phosphorescence again i said no need
to hurry sit down and make yourself at home
and as he spluttered over our disappointment
i began to lob more of these growths into the cleft
i thought it was daylight he said

  daylight cried i daybreak sunset clouds
and windy skies shall we ever see such things
again

  as i spoke a little picture of our world seemed
to rise before me bright and little and clear like
the background of some old italian picture the
sky that changes and the sea that changes and the
hills and the green trees and the towns and cities
shining in the sun think of a wet roof at sunset
cavor think of the windows of a westward
house he made no answer

  here we are burrowing in this beastly wrld
that isnt a world with its inky ocean hidden in
some abominable blackness below and outside that
torrid day and that death stillness of night and
all those things that are chasing us now beastly
men of leather-insect men that come out of a
nightmare after all theyre right what business
have we here smashing them and disturbing their
world for all we know the whole planet is up
and after us already in a minute we may hear
them whimpering and their gongs going what are
we to do where are we to go here we are as
comfortable as snakes from jamrachs loose in a
surbiton villa

  it was your fault said cavor

  my fault i shouted good lord

  i had an idea

  curse your ideas

  if we had refused to budge-- 

  under these goads

  yes they would have carried us

  over that bridge

  yes they must have carried us from outside
  id rather be carried by a fly across a ceiling
  good heavens

  i resumed my destruction of the fungi then
suddenly i saw something that struck me even
then

  cavor i said these chains are of gold

  he was thinking intently with his hands gripping
his cheeks he turned his head slowly and stared
at me and when i had repeated my words at the
twisted chain about his right hand so they are
he said so they are his face lost its transitory
interest even as he looked he hesitated for a
moment then went on with his interrupted medita-
tion i sat for a space puzzling over the fact that
i had only just observed this until i considered the
blue light in which we had been and which had
taken all the colour out of the metal and from
that discovery i also started upon a train of thought
that carried me wide and far i forgot that i had
just been asking what business we had in the
moon gold--

  it was cavor who spoke first it seem to me
that there are two courses open to us

  well

either we can attempt to make our way-fight
our way if necessary-out to the exterior again
and then hunt for our sphere until we find it or-

 the cold of the night comes to kill us or else-

 he paused yes i said though i knew what
 was coming

 we might attempt once more to establish some
 sort of understanding with the minds of the people
 in the moon

 so far as im concerned-its the first

 i doubt

 i dont

 you see said cavor i do not think we can
 judge the selenites by what we have seen of them
 their central world their civilised world will be
 far below in the profounder caverns about their
 sea this region of the crust in which we are is an
 outlying district a pastoral region at any rate
 that is my interpretation these selenites we have
 seen may be only the equivalent of cowboys and
 engine-tenders their use of goads-in all proba-
 bility mooncalf goads-the lack of imagination they
 show in expecting us to be able to do just what they
 can do their indisputable brutality all seem to
 point to something of that sort but if we en-
 dured-

 neither of us could endure a six-inch plank
 across the bottomless pit for very long

 no said cavor but then-

 i wont i said

 he discovered a new line of possibilities well
 suppose we got ourselves into some corner where
 we could defend ourselves against these hinds and
 labourers if for example we could hold out for
 a week or so it is probable that the news of our
 appearance would filter down to the more intelligent
 and populous parts-

 if they exist

 they must exist or whence came those tre-
 mendous machines

 thats possible but its the worst of the two
 chances

 we might write up inscriptions on walls-

 how do we know their eyes would see the sort
 of marks we made

 if we cut them---

 thats possible of course

 i took up a new thread of thought after all

 i said i suppose you dont think these selenites
 so infinitely wiser than men

 they must know a lot more-or at least a lot of
 different things

 yes but- i hesitated

 i think youll quite admit cavor that youre
 rather an exceptional man

how

 well you-youre a rather lonely man-have
 been that is you havent married

never wanted to but why-

 and you never grew richer than you happened
 to be

 never wanted that either

 youve just rooted after knowledge

 well a certain curiosity is natural-

 you think so thats just it you think every
 other mind wants to know i remember once when
the first men in the moon



i asked you why you conducted all these researches
you said you wanted your frs and to have the
stuff called cavorite and things like that you
know perfectly well you didnt do it for that
but at the time my question took you by surprise
and you felt you ought to have something to look
like a motive really you conducted researches be-
cause you had to its your twist

  perhaps it is-

  it isnt one man in a million has that twist
most men want-well various things but very few
want knowledge for its own sake i dont i know
perfectly well now these selenites seem to be a
driving busy sort of being but how do you know
that even the most intelligent will take an interest
in us or our world i dont believe theyll even know
we have a world they never come out at night
-theyd freeze if they did theyve probably never
seen any heavenly body at all except the blazing
sun how are they to know there is another world
what does it matter to them if they do well
even if they have had a glimpse of a few stars or
even of the earth crescent what of that why
should people living inside a planet trouble to ob-
serve that sort of thing men wouldnt have done
it except for the seasons and sailing why should
the moon people 

     well suppose there are a few philosophers like
yourself they are just the very selenites wholl
never have heard of our existence suppose a sele-
nite had dropped on the earth when you were at
lympne youd have been the last man in the world
to hear he had come you never read a newspaper
you see the chances against you well its for
these chances were sitting here doing nothing while
precious time is flying i tell you weve got into
a fix weve come unarmed weve lost our sphere
weve got no food weve shown ourselves to the
selenites and made them think were strange
strong dangerous animals and unless these sele-
nites are perfect fools theyll set about now and
hunt us till they find us and when they find us
theyll try to take us if they can and kill us if they
cant and thats the end of the matter if they
take us theyll probably kill us through some mis-
understanding after were done for they may dis-
cuss us perhaps but we shant get much fun out of
that

  go on

  on the other hand heres gold knocking about
like cast iron at home if only we can get some of
it back if only we can find our sphere again before
they do and get back then-

  yes

  we might put the thing on a sounder footing
come back in a bigger sphere with guns

  good lord cried cavor as though that was
horrible

  i shied another luminous fungus down the cleft

  look here cavor i said ive half the voting
power anyhow in this affair and this is a case for
a practical man im a practical man and you are
not im not going to trust to selenites and
geometrical diagrams again if i can help it   
thats all get back drop all this secrecy-or
most of it and come again

  he reflected when i came to the moon he
said i ought to have come alone

  the question before the meeting i eaid is
how to get back to the earthly sphere

  for a time we nursed our knees in silence then
he seemed to decide for my reasons

  i think he said one can get data it is
clear that while the sun is on this side of the moon
the air will be blowing through this planet sponge
from the dark side hither on this side at any rate
the air will be expanding and flowing out of the
moon caverns into the craters    very well
theres a draught here

  so there is

  and that means that this is not a dead end
somewhere behind us this cleft goes on and up
the draught is blowing up and that is the way we
have to go if we try to get up any sort of
chimney or gully there is we shall not only get out
of these passages where they are hunting for
us-

  but suppose the gully is too narrow

  well come down again

  ssh i said suddenly whats that

  we listened at first it was an indistinct mur-
mur and then one picked out the clang of a gong
they must think we are mooncalves said i to
be frightened at that

  theyre coming along that passage said
cavor

  they must be

  theyll not think of the cleft theyll go past
i listened again for a space this time i
whispered theyre likely to have some sort of
weapon

  then suddenly i sprang to my feet good hea-
vens cavor i cried but they willl theyll
see the fungi i have been pitching down

theyll-

  i didnt finish my sentence i turned about and
made a leap over the fungus tops towards the upper
end of the cavity i saw that the space turned up-
ward and became a draughty cleft again ascending
to impenetrable darkness i was about to clamber
up into this and then with a happy inspiration
turned back

  what are you doing asked cavor

  go on said i and went back and got two of
the shining fungi and putting one into the breast
pocket of my flannel jacket so that it stuck out
to light our climbing went back with the other for
cavor the noise of the selenites was now so loud
that it seemed they must be already beneath the
cleft but it might be they would have difficulty
in clambering into it or might hesitate to ascend
it against our possible resistance at any rate we
now had the comforting knowledge of the enormous
muscular superiority our birth in another planet
gave us in another minute i was clambering with
gigantic vigour after cavors blue-lit heels

chapter xvii
the fight in the cave of the moon butchers

i do not know how far we clambered before we
came to the grating it may be we ascended
only a few hundred feet but at the time it


amazing stories

seemed to me we might have hauled and jammed
and hopped and wedged ourselves through a mile
or more of vertical ascent whenever i recall that
time there comes into my head the heavy clank of
our golden chains that followed every movement
very soon my knuckles and knees were raw and
i had a bruise on one cheek after a time the first
violence of our efforts diminished and our move-
ments became more deliberate and less painful the
noise of the pursuing selenites had died away al-
together it seemed almost as though they had
not traced us up the crack after all in spite of
the tell-tale heap of broken fungi that must have
lain beneath it at times the cleft narrowed so
much that we could scarce squeeze up it at other
times it expanded into great cavities studded with
prickly crystals or thickly beset with dull shining
fungoid pimples sometimes it twisted spirally
and at other times slanted down nearly to the
horizontal direction ever and again there was
the intermittent drip and trickle of water by us
once or twice it seemed to us that small living
things had rustled out of- our reach but what they
were we never saw they may have been venomous
beasts for all i know but they did us no harm and
we were now tuned to a pitch when a weird creep-
ing thing more or less mattered little and at last
far above came the familiar bluish light again
and then we saw that it filtered through a grating
that barred our way

  we whispered as we pointed this out to one
another and became more and more cautious in
our ascent presently we were close under the
grating and by pressing my face against its bars
i could see a limited portion of the cavern beyond
it was clearly a large space and lit no doubt by
some rivulet of the same blue light that we had
seen flow from the beating machinery an inter-
mittent trickle of water dropped ever and again
between the bars near my face

  my first endeavour was naturally to see what
might be upon the floor of the cavern hut our
grating lay in a depression whose rim hid all this
from our eyes our foiled attention then fell back
upon the suggestion of the various sounds we heard
and presently my eye caught a number of faint
shadows that played across the dim roof far over-
head

  indisputably there were several selenites per-
haps a considerable number in this space for we
could hear the noises of their intercourse and faint
sounds that i identified as their footfalls there
was also a succession of regularly repeated sounds
-chid chid chid-which began and ceased sug-
gestive of a knife or spade hacking at some soft
substance then came a clank as if of chains a
whistle and a rumble as of a truck running over a
hollowed place and then again that chid chid chid
resumed the shadows told of shapes that moved
quickly and rhythmically in agreement with that
regular sound and rested when it ceased

  we put our heads close together and began to
discuss these things in noiseless whispers

  they are occupied i said they are occupied
in some way

  yes

   theyre not seeking us or thinking about us

   perhaps they have not heard of us

  those others are hunting about below if
 suddenly we appeared here-

   we looked at one another

   there might be a chance to parley said cavor

   no i said not as we are

   for a space we remained each occupied by his
 own thoughts

   chid chid chid went the chopping and the
 shadows moved to and fro

   i looked at the grating its flimsy i said
 we might bend two of the bars and crawl
 through

   we wasted a little time in vague discussion

 then i took one of the bars in both hands and
 got my feet up against the rock until they were
 almost on a level with my head and so thrust
 against the bar it bent so suddenly that i almost
 slipped i clambered about and bent the adjacent
 bar in the opposite direction and then took the
 luminous fungus from my pocket and dropped it
 down the fissure

   dont do anything hastily whispered cavor
 as i twisted myself up through the opening i had
 enlarged i had a glimpse of busy figures as i
 came through the grating and immediately bent
 down so that the rim of the depression in which
 the grating lay hid me from their eyes and so lay
 flat signalling advice to cavor as he also prepared
 to come through presently we were side by side
 in the depression peering over the edge at the
 cavern and its occupants

   it was a much larger cavern than we had sup-
 posed from our first glimpse of it and we looked
 up from the lowest portion of its sloping floor it
 widened out as it receded from us and its roof
 came down and hid the remoter portion altogether
 and lying in a line along its length vanishing at
 last far away in that tremendous perspective were
 a number of huge shapes huge pallid hulls upon
 which the selenites were busy at first they seemed
 big white cylinders of vague import then i noted
 the heads upon them lying towards us eyeless and
 skinless like the heads of sheep at a butchers and
 perceived they were the carcasses of mooncalves
 being cut up much as the crew of a whaler might
 cut up a moored whale they were cutting off the
 flesh in strips and on some of the farther trunks
 the white ribs were showing it was the sound of
 their hatchets that made that chid chid some
 distance away a thing like a trolley cable drawn
 and loaded with chunks of lax meat was running
 up the slope of the cavern floor this enormous
 long avenue of hulls that were destined to be food
 gave us a sense of the vast populousness of the
 moon-world second only to the effect of our first
 glimpse down the shaft

   it seemed to me at first that the selenites must
 be standing on trestle-supported planks and then
 i saw that the planks and supports and their
 hatchets were really of the same leaden hue as my

     do not remember seeing any wooden things on the moon doors
 tables everything corresponding to our terrestrial joinery was made
 of metal and i believe for the most part of gold which as a metal
 would of course naturally recommend itself-other things being equal
 -on account of the case in working it and its toughness and
 durability
the first men in the moon



fetters bad seemed before white light came to bear
on them a number of very thick-looking crow-
bars lay about the floor and had apparently assisted
to turn the dead mooncalf over on its side they
were perhaps six feet long with shaped handles
very tempting-looking weapons the whole place
was lit by three transverse streams of the blue
fluid

  we lay for a long time noting all these things in
silence well said cavor at last

  i crouched lower and turned to him i had come
upon a brilliant idea unless they lowered those
bodies by a crane i said we must be nearer the
surface than i thought

  why

  the mooncalf doesnt hop and it hasnt got
wings

  he peered over the edge of the hollow again
i wonder now    he began after all we
have never gone far from the surface-

  i stopped him by a grip on his arm i had heard
a noise from the cleft below us

  we twisted ourselves about and lay as still as
death with every sense alert in a little while i
did not doubt that something was quietly ascend-
ing the cleft very slowly and quite noiselessly i
assured myself of a good grip on my chain and
waited for that something to appear

  just look at those chaps with the hatchets again
i said

  theyre all right said cavor

  i took a sort of provisional aim at the gap in the
grating i could hear now quite distinctly the soft
twittering of the ascending selenites the dab of
their hands against the rocks and the falling of dust
from their grips as they clambered

  then i could see that there was something mov-
ing dimly in the blackness below the grating but
what it might be i could not distinguish the whole
thing seemed to hang fire just for a moment-then
smash i had sprung to my feet struck savagely
at something that had flashed out at me it was
the keen point of a spear i have thought since
that its length in the narrowness of the cleft must
have prevented its being sloped to reach me any-
how it shot out from the grating like the tongue
of a snake and missed and flew back and flashed
again but the second time i snatched and caught
it and wrenched it away but not before another
had darted ineffectually at me

  i shouted with triumph as i felt the hold of the
selenite resist my pull for a moment and give and
then i was jabbing down through the bars amidst
squeals from the darkness and cavor had snapped
off the other spear and was leaping and flourishing
it beside me and making inefficient jabs clang
clang came up through the grating and then an
axe hurtled through the air and whacked against
the rocks beyond to remind me of the fleshers at
the carcasses up the cavern

  i turned and they were all coming towards us
in open order waving their axes they were short
thick little beggars with long arms strikingly
different from the ones we had seen before if they
had not heard of us before they must have realised
the situation with incredible swiftness i stared

at them for a moment spear in hand guard that
grating cavor i cried howled to intimidate them
and rushed to meet them two of them missed
with their hatchets and the rest fled incontinently
then the two also were sprinting away up the
cavern with hands clenched and heads down i
never saw men run like them

  i knew the spear i had was no good for me it
was thin and flimsy only effectual for a thrust and
too long for a quick recover so i only chased
the selenites as far as the first carcass and stopped
there and picked up one of the crowbars that were
lying about it felt comfortingly heavy and equal
to smashing any number of selenites i threw away
my spear and picked up a second crowbar for the
other hand i felt five times better than i had
with the spear i shook the two threateningly at
the selenites who had come to a halt in a little
crowd far away up the cavern and then turned
about to look at cavor

  he was leaping from side to side of the grating
making threatening jabs with his broken spear
that was all right it would keep the selenites
down-for a time at any rate i looked up the
cavern again what on earth were we going to do
now

  we were cornered in a sort of way already but
these butchers up the cavern had been surprised
they were probably scared and they had no special
weapons only those little hatchets of theirs and
that way lay escape their sturdy little forms-
ever so much shorter and thicker than the moon-
calf herders-were scattered up the slope in a way
that was eloquent of indecision i had the moral
advantage of a mad bull in a street but for all
that there seemed a tremendous crowd of them
very probably there was those selenites down
the cleft had certainly some infernally long spears
it might be they had other surprises for us   
but confound it if we charged up the cave we
should let them up behind us and if we didnt those
little brutes up the cave would probably get rein-
forced heaven alone knew what tremendous
engines of warfare-guns bombs terrestrial tor-
pedoes-this unknown world below our feet this
vaster world of which we had only pricked the outer
cuticle might not presently send up to our destruc-
tion it became clear that the only thing to do was
to charge it became clearer as the legs of a num-
ber of fresh selenites appeared running down the
cavern towards us

  bedford cried cavor and behold he was half-
way between me and the grating

  go back i cried what are you doing--

  theyve got-its like a gun

  and struggling in the grating between those de-
fensive spears appeared the head and shoulders of
a singularly lean and angular selenite bearing some
complicated apparatus

  i realised cavors utter incapacity for the fight
we had in hand for a moment i hesitated then
i rushed past him whirling my crowbars and shout-
ing to confound the aim of the selenite he was
aiming in the queerest way with the thing against
his stomach chuzz the thing wasnt a gun


amazing stories

it went off like a cross-bow more and dropped me
in the middle of a leap

  i didnt fall down i simply came down a little
shorter than i should have done if i hadnt been
hit and from the feel of my shoulder the thing
might have tapped me and glanced off then my
left hand hit the shaft again and i perceived there
was a sort of spear sticking half through my
shoulder the moment after i got home with the
crowbar in my right hand and hit the selenite fair
and square he collapsed-he crushed and crumpled
-his head smashed like an egg

  i dropped a crowbar pulled the spear out of my
shoulder and began to jab it down the grating into
the darkness at each jab came a shriek and
twitter finally i hurled the spear down upon
them with all my strength leapt up picked up
the crowbar again and started for the multitude
up the cavern

  bedford cried cavor bedford as i flew
past him

  i seem to remember his footsteps coming on
behind me

  step leap    whack step leap    each
leap seemed to last ages with each the cave
opened out and the number of selenites visible
increased at first they seemed all running about
like ants in a disturbed ant-hill one or two waving
hatchets and coming to meet me more running
away some bolting sideways into the avenue of
carcasses then presently others came in sight
carrying spears and then others i saw a most
extraordinary thing all hands and feet bolting for
cover the cavern grew darker farther up flick
something flew over my head flick as i soared
in mid-stride i saw a spear hit and quiver in one of
the carcasses to my left then as i came down
one hit the ground before me and i heard the
remote chuzz with which their things were fired
flick flick for a moment it was a shower they
were volleying

  i stopped dead

  i dont think i thought clearly then i seem to
remember a kind of stereotyped phrase running
through my mind zone of fire seek coyer i
know i made a dash for the space between two of
the carcasses and stood there panting and feeling
very wicked

  i looked round for cavor and for a moment it
seemed as if he had vanished from the world then
he came out of the darkness between the row of
the carcasses and the rocky wall of the cavern
i saw his little face dark and blue and shining
with perspiration and emotion

  he was saying something but what it was i did
not heed i had realised that we might work from
mooncalf to mooncalf up the cave until we were
near enough to charge home it was charge or
nothing come on i said and led the way

  bedford he cried unavailingly

  my mind was busy as we went up that narrow
alley between the dead bodies and the wall of the
cavern the rocks curved about-they could not
enfilade us though in that narrow space we could
not leap yet with our earth-born strength we were
still able to go very much faster than the selenites

i reckoned we should presently come right among
them once we were on them they would be nearly
as formidable as black beetles only-there would
first of all be a volley i thought of a stratagem
i whipped off my flannel jacket as i ran

  bedford panted cavor behind me

  i glanced back what said i

  he was pointing upward over the carcasses

  white light he said white light again

  i looked and it was even so a faint white ghost
of twilight in the remoter cavern roof that seemed
to give me double strength

  keep close i said a flat long selenite dashed
out of darkness and squealed and fled i halted
and stopped cavor with my hand i hung my jacket
over my crowbar ducked round the next carcass
dropped jacket and crowbar showed myself and
darted back

  chuzz-flick just one arrow came we were
close on the selenites and they were standing in a
crowd broad short and tall together with a little
battery of their shooting implements pointing down
the cave three or four other arrows followed the
first and then their fire ceased

  i stuck out my head and escaped by a hairs-
breadth this time i drew a dozen shots or more
and heard the selenites shouting and twittering as
if with excitement as they shot i picked up jacket
and crowbar again

  now said i and thrust out the jacket

  chuzz-zz-zz-zz chuzz in an instant my
jacket had grown a thick beard of arrows and they
were quivering all over the carcass behind us
instantly i slipped the crowbar out of the jacket
dropped the jacket-for all i know to the contrary
it is lying up there in the moon now-and rushed
out upon them

  for a minute perhaps it was massacre i was too
fierce to discriminate and the selenites were prob-
ably too scared to fight at any rate they made
no sort of fight against me i saw scarlet as the
saying is i remember i seemed to be wading
among those leathery thin things as a man wades
through tall grass mowing and hitting first right
then left smash smash little drops of moisture
flew about i trod on things that crushed and piped
and went slippery the crowd seemed to open and
close and flow like water they seemed to have no
combined plan whatever spears flew about me i was
grazed over the ear by one i was stabbed once in
the arm and once in the cheek but i only found that
out afterwards when the blood had had time to
run and cool and feel wet

  what cavor did i do not know for a space
it seemed that this fighting had lasted for an age
and must needs go on for ever then suddenly it
was all over and there was nothing to be seen but
the backs of heads bobbing up and down as their
owners ran in all directions  i seemed alto-
gether unhurt i ran forward some paces shouting
then turned about i was amazed

  i had come right through them in vast flying
strides they were all behind me and running hither
and thither to hide

  i felt an enormous astonishment at the evapora
tiot of the great fight into which i had hurled
the first men in the moon



myself and not a little of exultation it did not
seem to me that i had discovered the selenites were
unexpectedly flimsy but that i was unexpectedly
strong i laughed stupidly this fantastic moon

  i glanced for a moment at the smashed and
writhing bodies that were scattered over the cavern
floor with a vague idea of further violence then
hurried on after cavor

chapter xviii

in the sunlight

presently we saw that the cavern before us
opened on a hazy void in another moment
we had emerged upon a sort of slanting
gallery that projected into a vast circular space a
huge cylindrical pit running vertically up and down
round this pit the slanting gallery ran without
any parapet or protection for a turn and a half and
then plunged high above into the rock again some-
how it reminded me then of one of those spiral
turns of the railway through the saint gothard
it was all tremendously huge i can scarcely hope
to convey to you the titanic proportion of all that
place the titanic effect of it our eyes followed up
the vast declivity of the pit wall and overhead and
far above we beheld a round opening set with faint
btars and half of the lip about it well-nigh blinding
with the white light of the sun at that we cried
aloud simultaneously

  come on i said leading the way

  but there said cavor and very carefully
stepped nearer the edge of the gallery i followed
his example and craned forward and looked down
but i was dazzled by that gleam of light above and
i could see only a bottomless darkness with spectral
patches of crimson and purple floating therein yet
if i could not see i could hear out of this dark-
ness came a sound a sound like the angry hum
one can hear if one puts ones ear outside a hive of
bees a sound out of that enormous hollow it may
be four miles beneath our feet   

  for a moment i listened then tightened my grip
on my crowbar and led the way up the gallery

  this must be the shaft we looked down upon
said cavor under that lid

and below there is where we saw the lights

  the lights said he yes-the lights of the
world that now we shall never see

  well come back i said for now we had escaped
so much i was rashly sanguine that we should re-
cover the sphere

  his answer i did not catch

  eh i asked

  it doesnt matter he answered and we hurried
on in silence

  i suppose that slanting lateral way was four or
five miles long allowing for its curvature and it
ascended at a slope that would have made it almost
impossibly steep on earth but which one strode up
easily under lunar conditions we saw only two
selenites during all that portion of our flight and
directly they became aware of us they ran head-
long it was clear that the knowledge of our
strength and violence had reached them our way
to the exterior was unexpectedly plain the spiral

gallery straightened into a steeply ascendent tunnel
its floor bearing abundant traces of the mooncalves
and so straight and short in proportion to its vast
arch that no part of it was absolutely dark almost
immediately it began to lighten and then far off
and high up and quite blindingly brilliant appeared
its opening on the exterior a slope of alpine steep-
ness surmounted by a crest of bayonet shrub tall
and broken down now and dry and dead in spiky
silhouette against the sun

  and it is strange that we men to whom this very
vegetation had seemed so weird and horrible a
little time ago should now behold it with the
emotion a home-coming exile might feel at sight of
his native land we welcomed even the rareness
of the air that made us pant as we ran and which
rendered speaking no longer the easy thing that it
had been but an effort to make oneself heard
larger grew the sunlit circle above us and larger
and all the nearer tunnel sank into a rim of indis-
tinguishable black we saw the dead bayonet
shrub no longer with any touch of green in it but
brown and dry and thick and the shadow of its
upper branches high out of sight made a densely
interlaced pattern upon the tumbled rocks and
at the immediate mouth of the tunnel was a wide
trampled space where the mooncalves had come
and gone

  we came out upon this space at last into a light
and heat that hit and pressed upon us we traversed
the exposed area painfully and clambered up a
slope among the scrub stems and sat down at last
panting in a high place beneath the shadow of a
mass of twisted lava even in the shade the rock
felt hot

  the air was intensely hot and we were in great
physical discomfort but for all that we were no
longer in a nightmare we seemed to have come
to our own province again beneath the stars all
the fear and stress of our flight through the dim
passages and fissures below had fallen from us
that last fight had filled us with an enormous con-
fidence in ourselves so far as the selenites were
concerned we looked back almost incredulously
at the black opening from which we had just
emerged down there it was in a blue glow that
now in our memories seemed the next thing to
absolute darkness we had met with things like
mad mockeries of men helmet-headed creatures
and had walked in fear before them and had
submitted to them until we could submit no longer
and behold they had smashed like wax and
scattered like chaff and fled and vanished like the
creatures of a dream

  i rubbed my eyes doubting whether we had not
slept and dreamt these things by reason of the
fungus we had eaten and suddenly discovered the
blood upon my face and then that my shirt wa
sticking painfully to my shoulder and arm

  confound it i said gauging my injuries with
an investigatory hand and suddenly that distant
tunnel mouth became as it were a watching eye

  cavor i said what are they going to do
now and what are we going to do

  he shook his head with his eyes fixed upon the
tunnel how can one tell what they will do


amazing stories

  it depends on what they think of us and i
dont see how we can begin to guess that and it
depends upon what they have in reserve its as
you say cavor we have touched the merest outside
of this world they may have all sorts of things
inside here even with those shooting things they
might make it bad for us   

  yet after all i said even if we dont find the
sphere at once there is a chance for us we might
hold out even through the night we might go
down there again and make a fight for it

  i stared about me with speculative eyes the
character of the scenery had altered altogether by
reason of the enormous growth and subsequent
drying of the scrub the crest on which we sat
was high and commanded a wide prospect of the
crater landscape and we saw it now all sere and
dry in the late autumn of the lunar afternoon ris-
ing one behind the other were long slopes and fields
of trampled brown where the mooncalves had
pastured and far away in the full blaze of the sun
a drove of them basked slumberously scattered
shapes each with a blot of shadow against it like
sheep on the side of a down but never a sign of a
selenite was to be seen whether they had fled on
our emergence from the interior passages or
whether they were accustomed to retire after driv-
ing out the mooncalves i cannot guess at the
time i believed the former was the case

  if we were to set fire to all this stuff i said
we might find the sphere among the ashes

  cavor did not seem to hear me he was peering
under his hand at the stars that still in spite of
the intense sunlight were abundantly visible in
the sky how long do you think we have been
here he asked at last

  been where

  on the moon

  two earthly days perhaps

  more nearly ten do you know the sun is
past its zenith and sinking in the west in four
days time or less it will be night

  but-weve only eaten once

 i know that and- but there are the

stars

  but why should time seem different because we
are on a smaller planet

  i dont know there it is

  how does one tell time

  hunger-fatigue-all those things are different
everything is different-everything to me it
seems that since first we came out of the sphere
has been only a question of hours-long hours-at
most

  ten days i said that leaves-- i looked
up at the sun for a moment and then saw that it
was halfway from zenith to the western edge of
things four days    cavor we mustnt sit
here and dream how do you think we may begin
i stood up we must get a fixed point we can
recognize-we might hoist a flag or a handkerchief
or something-and quarter the ground and work
round that

  he stood up beside me

  yes he said there is nothing for it but to

hunt the sphere nothing we may find it-

certainly we may find it and if not-

  we must keep on looking

  he looked this way and that glanced up at the
sky and down at the tunnel and astonished me
by a sudden gesture of impatience oh but we
have done foolishly to have come to this pass
think how it might have been and the things we
might have done

  we may do something yet

  never the thing we might have done here
below our feet is a world think of what that
world must be think of that machine we saw
and the lid and the shaft they were just remote
outlying things and those creatures we have seen
and fought with no more than ignorant peasants
dwellers in the outskirts yokels and labourers half
akin to brutes down below caverns beneath
caverns tunnels structures ways  it must
open out and be greater and wider and more
populous as one descends assuredly right down
at last to the central sea that washes round the core
of the moon think of its inky waters under the
spare lights-if indeed their eyes need lights
think of the cascading tributaries pouring down
their channels to feed it think of the tides upon
its surface and the rush and swirl of its ebb and
flow perhaps they have ships that go upon it
perhaps down there are mighty cities and swarm-
ing ways and wisdom and order passing the wit
of man and we may die here upon it and never
see the masters who must be-ruling over these
things we may freeze and die here and the air
will freeze and thaw upon us and then- then
they will come upon us come on our stiff and silent
bodies and find the sphere we cannot find and they
will understand at last too late all the thought and
effort that ended here in vain

  his voice for all that speech sounded like the
voice of some one heard in a telephone weak and
far away

   but the darkness i said

  one might get over that

  how

  i dont know how am i to know one might

carry a torch one might have a lamp- the

others-might understand

  he stood for a moment with his hands held down
and a rueful face staring out over the waste that
defied him then with a gesture of renunciation
he turned towards me with proposals for the
systematic hunting of the sphere

   we can return i said

 he looked about him first of all we shall have
to get to earth

  we could bring back lamps to carry and climb-
ing irons and a hundred necessary things

   yes he said

  we can take back an earnest of success in this
gold

  he looked at my golden crowbars and said noth-
ing for a space he stood with his hands clasped
behind his back staring across the crater at last
he sighed and spoke it was i found the way here
but to find a way isnt always to be master of a
way if i take my secret back to earth what will
the first men in the moon



happen i do not see how i can keep my secret for
a year for even a part of a year sooner or later
it must come out even if other men rediscover it
and then    governments and powers will
struggle to get hither they will fight against one
another and against these moon people it will only
spread warfare and multiply the occasions of war
in a little while in a very little while if i tell my
secret this planet to its deepest galleries will be
strewn with human dead other things are doubt-
ful but that is certain  it is not as though
man had any use for the moon what good would
the moon be to men even of their own planet
what have they made but a battle-ground and
theatre of infinite folly small as his world is
and short as his time he has still in his little life
down there far more than he can do no science
has toiled too long forging weapons for fools to use
it is time she held her hand let him find it out
for himself again-in a thousand years time

  there are methods of secrecy i said

  he looked up at me and smiled after all he
said why should one worry  there is little chance
of our finding the sphere and down below things
are brewing its simply the human habit of hop-
ing till we die that makes us think of return our
troubles are only beginning we have shown these
moon folk violence we have given them a taste of
our quality and our chances are about as good as
a tigers that has got loose and killed a man in
hyde park the news of us must be running down
from gallery to gallery down towards the central
parts   no sane beings will ever let us take
that sphere back to earth after so much as they
have seen of us

  we arent improving our chances said i by
sitting here

  we stood up side by side

  after all he said we must separate we must
stick up a handkerchief on these tall spikes here and
fasten it firmly and from this as a centre we must
work over the crater you must go westward
moving out in semicircles to and fro towards the
setting sun you must move first with your
shadow on your right until it is at right angles with
the direction of your handkerchief and then with
your shadow on your left and i will do the same to

the east we will look into every gully examine
every skerry of rocks we will do all we can to
find my sphere if we see the selenites we will
hide from them as well as we can for drink we
must take snow and if we feel the need of food
we must kill a mooncalf if we can and eat such
flesh as it has-raw-and so each will go his own
way

  and if one of us comes upon the sphere

  he must come back to the white handkerchief
and stand by it and signal to the other

 and if neither-

  cavor glanced up at the sun we go on seeking
until the night and cold overtake us

  suppose the selenites have found the sphere and
hidden it

  he shrugged his shoulders

  or if presently they come hunting us

  he made no answer

  you had better take a club i said

  he shook his head and stared away from me
across the waste

  but for a moment he did not start he looked
round at me shyly hesitated au revoir he said

  i felt an odd stab of emotion a sense of how
we had galled each other and particularly how i
must have galled him came to me confound it
thought i we might have done better i was
on the point of asking him to shake hands-for
that somehow was how i felt just then-when
he put his feet together and leapt away from me
towards the north he seemed to drift through the
air as a dead leaf would do fell lightly and leapt
again i stood for a moment watching him then
faced westward reluctantly pulled myself together
and with something of the feeling of a man who
leaps into icy water selected a leaping point and
plunged forward to explore my solitary half of the
moon world i dropped rather clumsily among
rocks stood up and looked about me clambered
on to a rocky slab and leapt again   

  when presently i looked for cavor he was hidden
from my eyes but the handkerchief showed out
bravely on its headland white in the blaze of the
sun

  i determined not to lose sight of that handker-
chief whatever might betide

anatruther leaped upon the hold-up man the driver said he heard anstruthers muscles crunch savagely as with little apparent

effort ho flung the man over the ford
the man with the strange head



man in a gray hat stood half way down
the corridor smoking a cigar and ap-
parently interested in my knocking and
waiting i rapped again on the door of
number  and waited some more but
all remained silent finally my observer ap-
proached me

  i dont believe it will do any good he said
ive just been trying it i would like to talk to
someone who is connected with anstruther are
you

  only this i handed him a letter out of my
pocket without comment as one is apt to do with
a thing that has caused one no little wonderment
dear doctor it said succinctly i have
been under the care of dr faubourg who has
recently died i would like to have you take
charge of me on a contract basis and keep me
well instead of waiting till i get sick i can
pay you enough to make you independent but
in return for that you will have to accept an
astonishing revelation concerning me and keep
it to yourself if this seems acceptable to you
call on me at  oclock wednesday evening
josiah anstruther room  cornhusker
hotel

  if you have time said the man in the gray hat
handing me back the letter come with me my
name is jerry stoner and i make a sort of living
writing for magazines i live in  just above
here

  by some curious architectural accident he con-
tinued as we reached his room that ventilator
there enables me to hear minutely everything that
goes on in the room below i havent ever said any-
thing about it during the several months that ive
lived here partly because it does not disturb me and
partly because it has begun to pique my curiosity-
a writer can confess to that can he not the man
below is quiet and orderly but seems to work a
good deal on some sort of clockwork i can hear it
whirring and clicking quite often but listen
now

  standing within a cou-
ple of feet of the opening mrthilihmlhmhhbflbf-
which was covered with
an iron grill i could hear
footsteps they were re-
gular and would decrease
in intensity as the person
walked away from the
ventilator opening below
and increase again as he
approached it were interrupted for a moment as
he probably stepped on a rug and were shorter
for two or three counts no doubt as he turned at
the end of the room this was repeated in a reg-
ular rhythm as long as i listened

  well i said

  you perceive nothing strange about that i sup-
pose said jerry stoner but if you had listened
all day long to just exactly that you would begin to
wonder that is the way he was going on when i
awoke this morning i was out from  to  this
forenoon the rest of the time i have been writing
steadily with an occasional stretch at the window

 and all of the time i have heard steadily what you
 hear now without interruption or change its
 getting on my nerves

    i have called him on the phone and have rung
 it on and off for twenty minutes i could hear his
 bell through the ventilator but he pays no attention
 to it so a while ago i tried to call on him do you
 know him

    i know who he is i replied but do not remem-
 ber ever having met him

   if you had ever met him you would remember
 he has a queer head i made my curiosity con-
 cerning the sounds from his room an excuse to cul-
 tivate his acquaintance the cultivation was diffi-
 cult he is courteous but seemed afraid of me
 we agreed that there was not much that we could
 do about it i gave up trying to keep my appoint-
 ment told stoner that i was glad i had met him
 and went home the next morning at seven he had
 me on the telephone

   are you still interested he asked and his
 voice was nervous that birds been at it all
 night come and help me talk to the hotel manage-
 ment i needed no urging

    i found beesley the hotel manager with stoner
 he was from st louis and looked french

    he can do it if he wants to he said shrugging
 his shoulders comically unless you complain of it
 as a disturbance

    it isnt that said stoner there must be some-
 thing wrong with the man

   some form of insanity- i suggested

 or a compulsion neurosis

    thats what ill be pretty soon stoner said
a he is a queer gink anyway as far as i have been
able to find out he has no close friends there is
something about his appearance that makes me
shiver his face is so wrinkled and droopy and yet
he sails about the streets with an unusually grace-
ful and vigorous step loan me your pass key i
think im as close a friend of his as anyone
beesley lent the key but stoner was back in a
few minutes shaking his head beesley was expect-
ing that he told us that
		when the hotel was built

anstruther had the doors
made of steel with special
bars at his own expense
and the windows shut-
tered as though he were
afraid for his life

his rooms would be as
hard to break into as a
fort beesley said as he left us and thus far we
do not have sufficient reason for wrecking the
hotel

    look here i said to stoner it will take me a
 couple of hours to hunt up the stuff and string up
 a periscope its an old trick i learned as a boy
 scout

   between us we had it up in about that time a
 radio aerial mast clamped on the window sill with
 mirrors at the top and bottom and a telescope at
 our end of it gave us a good view of the room be-
 low us it was a sort of living room made by throw-
 ing together two of the regular sized hotel rooms

 t-j ere is one of the most fantastic bits of scientific-
 tion we have ever read this is a story so strange
 and amazing that it will keep your interest until the end

   you arc not permitted to know until at the very end
 ivhat it is really all about and you will follow the pro-
 ceedings with keen interest


amazing stories

anstruther was walking across it diagonally dis-
appearing from our field of view at the further end
and coming back again his head hung forward on
his chest with a ghastly limpness he was a big
well-built man with a vigorous stride always it
was -the same path he avoided the small table in
the middle each time with exactly the same sort of
side step and swing his head bumped limply as he
turned near the window and started back across the
room for two hours we watched him in shivering
fascination during which he walked with the same
hideous uniformity

  that makes thirty hours of this said stoner
wouldnt you say that there was something
wrong

  we tried another consultation with the hotel
manager as a physician i advised that something
be done that he be put in a hospital or something
i was met with another shrug

  how will you get him i still do not see suf-
ficient cause for destroying the hotel companys
property it will take dynamite to get at him

  he agreed however to a consultation with the
police and in response to our telephone call the
great genial chief peter john smith was soon sit-
ting with us he advised us against breaking in

  a man has a right to walk that way if he wants
to he said heres this fellow in the papers who
played the piano for  hours and the police didnt
stop him and in germany they practice making
public speeches for  hours at a stretch and
there was this olympic dancing fad some months
ago where a couple danced for  hours

  it doesnt look right to me i said shaking my
head there seems to be something wrong with
the mans appearance some uncanny disease of the
nervous system-lord knows ive never heard of
anything that resembles it

  we decided to keep a constant watch i had to
spend a little time on my patients but stoner and
the chief stayed and agreed to call me if occasion
arose i peeped through the periscope at the walk-
ing man several times during the next twenty-four
hours and it was always exactly the same the
hanging bumping head the uniformity of his
course the uncanny machine-like exactitude of his
movements i spent an hour at a time with my eye
at the telescope studying his movements for some
variation but was unable to be certain of any
that afternoon i looked up my neurology texts
but found no clues the next day at  oclock in
the afternoon after not less than  hours of it i
was there with stoner to see the end of it chief
peter john smith was out

  as we watched we saw that he moved more and
more slowly but with otherwise identical motions
it had the effect of the slowed motion pictures of
dancers or athletes or it seemed like some curious
dream for as we watched the sound of the steps
through the ventilator also slowed and weakened
then we saw him sway a little and totter as
though his balance were imperfect he swayed a
few times and fell sidewise on the floor we could
see one leg in the field of our periscope moving
slowly with the same movements as in walking a

slow dizzy sort of motion in five more minutes
he was quite still

  the chief was up in a few moments in response
to our telephone call

  now weve got to break in he said beesley
shrugged his shoulders and said nothing stoner
came to the rescue of the hotel property

  a small man could go down this ventilator
this grill can be unscrewed and the lower one can
be knocked out with a hammer it is cast-iron

  beesley was gone like a flash and soon returned
with one of his window-washers who was small and
wiry and also a rope and hammer we took off the
grill and held the rope as the man crawled in he
shouted to us as he hit the bottom the air drew
strongly downwards but the blows of his hammer
on the grill came up to us we hurried down-
stairs not a sound came through the door of 
and we waited for some minutes then there was a
rattle of bars and the door opened and a gust of
cold wind struck us with a putrid odor that made
us gulp the man had evidently run to open a
window before coming to the door

  anstruther lay on his side with one leg straight
and the other extended forward as in a stride his
face was livid sunken hideous stoner gave him
a glance and then scouted around the room-look-
ing for the machinery he had been hearing but
finding none the chief and i also went over the
rooms but they were just conventional rooms
rather colorless and lacking in personality the
chief called an undertaker and also the coroner
and arranged for a post-mortem examination i
received permission to notify a number of pro-
fessional colleagues i wanted some of them to
share in the investigation of this unusual case with
me as i was leaving i could not help noting the
astonished gasps of the undertakers assistants as
they lifted the body but they were apparently too
well trained to say anything

  that evening a dozen physicians gathered around
the figure covered with a white sheet on the table
in the center of the undertakers work room stoner
was there a writer may be anywhere he chooses
the coroner was preparing to draw back the sheet

  the usual medical history is lacking in this
case he said perhaps an account by dr b
or his author friend of the curious circumtances
connected with the death of this man may take its
place

  i can tell a good deal said stoner and i
think it will bear directly on what you find when
you open him up even though it is not technical
medical stuff do you care to hear it

  tell it go on lets have it

  i have lived above him in the hotel for several
months stoner began he struck me as a curious
person and as i do some writing all mankind is
my legitimate field for study i tried to find out
all i could about him

  he has an office in the little building and
did a rather curious business he dealt in vases
and statuary book-ends and chimes and things you
put around in rooms to make them look artistic he
had men out buying the stuff and others selling
it all by personal contact and on a very exclusive
the man with the strange head



basis he kept the stock in a warehouse near the
rock island tracks where they pass the ball park
i do not believe that he ever saw any of it he
just sat in the office and signed papers and the
other fellows made the money and apparently they
made a lot of it for he has swung some big financial
deals in this town

  i often met him in the lobby or the elevator
he was a big vigorous man and walked with an un-
usually graceful step and an appearance of strength
and vitality his eyes seemed to light up with re-
cognition when he saw me but in my company he
was always formal and reserved for such a
vigorous looking man his voice was singularly
cracked and feeble and his head gave an impression
of being rather small for him and his face old
and wrinkled

  he seemed fairly well known about the city at
the eastridge club they told me that he plays golf
occasionally and excellently and is a graceful
dancer though somehow not a popular partner he
was seen frequently at the y m c a bowling
alleys and played with an uncanny skill men
loved to see him bowl for his cleverness with the
balls but wished he were not so formally courteous
and did not wear such an expression of complete
happiness over his victories bridley manager of
rudge  guenzels book department was the oldest
friend of his that i could find and he gave me some
interesting information they went to school to-
gether and anstruther was poor in health as well as
in finances twenty-five years ago during the hungry
and miserable years after his graduation from the
university bridley remembered him as saying

   my brain needs a body to work with if i had
physical strength i could do anything if i find
a fellow who can give it to me ill make him rich

  bridley also remembers that he was sensitive
because girls did not like his debilitated physique
he seems to have found health later though i can
find no one who remembers how or when about
ten years ago he came back from europe where
he had been for several years in paris bridley
thinks and for several years after this a french-
man lived with him the city directory of that time
has him living in the big stone house at th and
g streets i went up there to look around and
found it a double house dr faubourg having oc-
cupied the other half the present caretaker has
been there ever since anstruther lived in the house
and she says that his french companion must have
been some sort of an engineer and that the two
must have been working on an invention from
the sounds she heard and the materials they
had about some three or four years ago the
frenchman and the machinery vanished and an-
struther moved to the cornhusker hotel also at
about this time dr faubourg retired from the
practice of medicine he must have been about
 years old and too healthy and vigorous to be
retiring on account of old age or ill health

  apparently anstruther never married his pri-
vate life was quite obscure but he appeared much
in public he was always very courtly and polite
to the ladies outside his business he took a great
interest in y m c a and boy scout camps in the

national guard and in fact in everything that stood
for an outdoor physical life and promoted health
in spite of his oddity he was quite a hero with the
small boys especially since the time of his radium
hold-up this is intimately connected with the story
of his radium speculation that caused such a sen-
sation in financial circles a couple of years ago

  about that time the announcement appeared
of the discovery of new uses for radium a way had
been found to accelerate its splitting and to derive
power from it its price went up and it promised
to become a scarce article on the market anstruther
had never been known to speculate nor to tamper
with sensational things like oil and helium but on
this occasion he seemed to go into a panic he
cashed in on a lot of securities and caused a small
panic in the city as he was quite wealthy and had
especially large amounts of money in the building-
ioan business the newspapers told of how he had
bought a hundred thousand dollars worth of radium
which was to be delivered right here in lincoln-
a curious method of speculating the editors volun-
teered

  it arrived by express one day and anstruther
rode the express wagon with the driver to the sta-
tion i found the driver and he told the story
of the hold-up at th and p streets at eleven
oclock at night a ford car drove up beside them
from which a man pointed a pistol at them and
ordered them to stop the driver stopped

   come across with the radium shouted the big
black bulk in the ford climbing upon the express
wagon anstruthers fist shot out like a flash of
lightning aw struck the arm holding the pistol and
the driver states that he heard the pistol crash
through the window on -the second floor of the lin-
coln hotel anstruther pushed the express driver
who was in his way backwards over the seat among
the packages and leaped upon the hold-up man
the driver said he heard anstruthers muscles
crunch savagely as with little apparent effort
he flung the man over the ford he fell with d
thud on the asphalt and stayed there anstruther
then launched a kick at the man at the wheel of the
ford who crumpled up and fell out of the opposite
side of the car

  the police found the pistol inside a room on
the second floor of the lincoln hotel the steering
post of the ford car was torn from its fastenings
both of the hold-up men had ribs and collar-bones
broken and the gunmans forearm was bent double
in the middle with both bones broken these two
men agreed later with the express driver that an-
struthers attack for suddenness swiftness and
terrific strength was beyond anything they had
dreamed possible he was like a thunderbolt like
some furious demon when the two men were
huddled in black heaps on the pavement anstruther
said to the driver quite impersonally

  drive to the police station come on wake
up ive got to get this stuff locked up

one of the hold-up men had lost all his money
and the home he was building when anstruther
had foreclosed a loan in his desperate scramble for

author of the moon metal a columbus of space etc

on the broad breast of the sphinx be saw a representation of a world overwhelmed with a deluge and encircling it was what he
instantly concluded to be the picture of a nebula underneath in ancient egyptian hieroglyphics with which cosmo was familiar
was an inscription in letters of gold-the prophecy of the second deluge
what went before

cosmo versal has made the discovery that the
world is on the eve of a second deluge he
placards new york with posters calling all to pre-
pare for the coming flood for his own safety he
begins the building of an enormous ark and barely
has it completed when reports are flashed about
the world that the waters are actually beginning
to rise

  suddenly in midday the world grew dark and
people became terror-stricken the rain descended
from an invisible source and the waters rose liter-
ally the world sweat about his ark cosmo had
placed electric wires and when the maddened pop-
ulace now terrified beyond measure attempted to
storm the ark hundreds were shocked and many in-
stantly killed then the waters rose ten feet an
hour

  finally the city of new york is all submerged
and the huge municipal building is nearly all under
water when the last of the government battleships

breaks away from the brooklyn navy-hard and is
carried over against the municipal building smash-
ing through the side and then sinking to the bottom
from this wreck a small boat arises and in this
boat comes amos blank the richest man in the
world alongside the ark blank has lost his
mind but he offers a billion dollars in securities
and waves the packet over his head if cosmo will
take him aboard he is taken in and then the ark
is started toward the east where it has been fig-
ured is the worlds highest land and which will be
the first landing place when the waters recede sud-
denly those aboard see the stars overhead and know
it has stopped raining

  meanwhile professor pludder has been convey-
ing the president with a party in an aeroplane
while the water is falling and when the rain stops
this wonderful flying-machine rests on a mountain
peak it can be converted into a serviceable boat
and this is done

mutiny in the ark

e left cosmo versal and his ark full of
the flower of mankind in the midst of
what was formerly the atlantic ocean
but which had now expanded over so
many millions of square miles which had
once been the seats of vast empires that to an eye
looking at it with a telescope from mars it would
have been unrecognizable

  all of eastern north america all of south ameri-
ca to the feet of the andes all but the highest
mountains of europe
nearly all of africa ex-
cept some of the high-
lands of the south all of
northern and southwest-
ern asia as well as the
peninsula of india all of
china and the adjacent
lands and islands except
the lofty peaks the whole
of australia and the
archipelagoes of the paci-
fic had become parts of

the floor of a mighty ocean which rolled unbroken
from pole to pole

  the great deep had resumed its ancient reign
and what was left of the habitable globe presented
to view only far separated islands and the serrated
tops of such ranges as the alps the caucasus the
himalayas and the andes the astonished in-
habitants of the ocean depths now swam over the
ruins of great cities and brushed with their fins
the chiseled capitals of columns that had supported
the proudest structures of human hands

 p ractically the whole world is now covered by
 the great flood as far as the survivors of the ark
 know

   the jules verne the intrepid french submarine in
 the meanwhile is exploring the submerged world and is
 visiting the city of paris and later with cosmo versdl
 as a passenger egypt is visited as well important dis-
 coveries are made particularly at the sphynx and its
 long suspected secret is at last revealed

  we have seen how the unexpected arrest of the
flood had left cosmo uncertain as to the course that
he ought to pursue but he did not long remain in
doubt he was sure that the downpour would be
resumed after an interval which at the most could
not exceed a few weeks and he resolved to con-
tinue his way toward the future land of promise
in asia

  but he thought that he would have time to turn
his prow in the direction of europe for he felt a
great desire to know by actual inspection to what
height the water had attained he was certain that
it could not be less than he had estimated-the in-
dications of his rain-gage
nbmbbbhnbhbhbmmb	been too unvarying

to admit of doubt on that
point-but he had no
means of direct measure-
ment since he could not
sound the tremendous
depths beneath the ark

  after long meditation
on the probable effects of
the descending columns of
wpwmmhllw--pg water which he had seen

                      he concluded that they
might have added more rapidly than he first sup-
posed to the increase of the general level besides
he reflected that there was no proof that the general
downpour might not have been greater over some
parts of the earth than others all these doubts
could be dissipated if he could get a good look at
some lofty mountain range such as the sierra
nevada of spain or the pyrenees or if he could
venture within sight of them the alps

  so he said to captain arms

  steer for the coast of europe




amazing stories

  the fine weather had produced a good effect upon
the spirits of the company not only were the
ports and the gangways all open but cosmo ordered
the temporary removal of rows of adjustable plates
on the sides of the vessel which transformed the
broad outer gangways running its whole length
into delightful promenade decks there in cozy
chairs and protected with rugs the passengers sat
fanned by a refreshing breeze and dazzled by the
splendor of the ocean

  they recalled by their appearance a ship-load
of summer tourists bound for the wonders and
pleasures of foreign parts this likeness to a
pleasure cruise was heightened by the constant
attentions of the crew under cosmos orders who
carried about refreshing drinks and lunches and
conducted themselves like regular ocean stewards

  it seemed impossible to believe that the world had
been drowned and some almost persuaded them-
selves that the whole thing was a dream

  it must not be supposed that the thousand-odd
persons who composed this remarkable ships com-
pany were so hard-hearted so selfish so forgetful
so morally obtuse that they never thought of the
real horror of their situation and of the awful
calamity that had overwhelmed so many millions
of their fellow creatures they thought of all that
only too seriously and in spite of themselves the
women especially were overwhelmed by it but
they did not wish to dwell upon it and cosmo ver-
sal did not wish that they should

  at night he had musicians play in the grand
saloon he distributed books among the passengers
from a large library which he had selected and at
last he had the stage set and invited his friends
the players to entertain the company

  but he would have no plays but those of shake-
speare

  there were probably not half a dozen persons
in the ark who had even seen representations of
these great dramas and very few who had read
them so that they had the advantage of complete
novelty

  the play selected for the first representation was
the tragedy of king lear a strange choice it
would at first sight seem but cosmo versal had
a deep knowledge of human nature he knew that
only tragedy would be endured there and that it
must be tragedy so profound and overmastering
that it would dominate the feelings of those who
heard and beheld it it was the principle of im-
munizing therapeutics where poison paralyzes
poison

  it turned out as he anticipated these people
unused to such depth of dramatic passion for the
plays to which they had been used had been far
from the shakespearian standard were wholly ab-
sorbed in the development of the tragedy it was a
complete revelation to them and they were carried
out of themselves and found in the sympathy
awakened by this heart-crushing spectacle of the
acme of human woe an unconscious solace for their
own moral anguish

  afterward cosmo put upon the stage hamlet
and othello and macbeth and coriolanus
and julius cassar but he avoided for the present

the less tragic dramas and all of them being new
to the hearers produced an enormous effect

  on alternate nights he substituted music for the
drama and as this was confined to the most ma-
jestic productions of the great masters of the past
many of whose works like some of shakespeares
had long been neglected if not forgotten their
power over the spirits of the company was perhaps
even more pronounced

  cosmo versal was already beginning the educa-
tion of his chosen band of race regenerators while
he mused upon the wonders that the science of
eugenics would achieve after the world should have
re-emerged from the waters

  one of the most singular effects of the music
was that produced upon the insane billionaire amos
blank he had been confined in the room that
cosmo had assigned to him and was soothed when-
ever cosmo could find time to visit him with pre-
tended acquiescense in his crazed notion that the
trip of the ark was part of a scheme to corner
the resources of the world

  cosmo persuaded him that the secret was un-
known except to themselves and that it was
essential to success that he blank should remain
in retirement and accordingly the latter expressed
no desire to leave his place of imprisonment which
he regarded as the headquarters of the combina-
tion passing hours in covering sheets of paper with
columns of figures which he fancied represented
the future profits of the enterprise

  one night when a symphony of beethoven was
to be played cosmo led amos blank through the
crowded saloon and placed him near the musicians
he resisted at first and when he saw the crowd he
drew back exclaiming

  what not overboard yet

  but cosmo soothed him with some whispered
promise and he took his seat glancing covertly
around him then the instruments struck up and
immediately fixed his attention as the musical
theme developed his eyes gradually lost their wild
look and a softened expression took its place he
sank lower in his seat and rested his head upon his
hand his whole soul seemed at last to be ab-
sorbed in the music when it was finished blank
was a changed man then cosmo clearly explained
to him all that had happened

  after the first overwhelming effect of his re-
awakening to the realities of his situation had
passed the billionaire was fully restored to all his
faculties henceforth he mingled with the other
passengers and as if the change that had come over
his spirit had had greater results than the simple
restoration of sanity he became one of the most
popular and useful members of cosmo versals
family of pilgrims

  among the other intellectual diversions which
cosmo provided was something quite unique due
to his own mental bias this consisted of con-
ferences held in the grand saloon afternoons in
the presence of the entire company at which the
principal speakers were his two speculative gen-
iuses costake theriade and sir wilfrid athel-
stone they did not care very much for one an-
the second deluge



other and each thought that the time allotted to
the other was wasted

  theriade wished to talk continuously of the in-
finite energy stored up in the atoms of matter and
of the illimitable power which the release of that
energy by the system that he had all but completed
would place at the disposition of man and at the
same time sir athelstone could with difficulty be
held in leash while he impatiently awaited an op-
portunity to explain how excessively near he had
arrived to the direct production of protoplasm from
inanimate matter and the chemical control of living
cells so that henceforth man could people or un-
people the earth as he liked

  one evening when everybody not on duty was in
bed captain amos entered cosmos cabin where
the latter was dictating to joseph smith and softly
approaching his chief with a furtive glance round
the room stooped and whispered something in his
ear a startled though incredulous expression ap-
peared on cosmos face and he sprang to his feet
but before speaking he obeyed a sign from the
captain and told smith to leave the room then he
locked the door and returned to his table where
he dropped into a chair exclaiming in a guarded
voice

  great heaven can this be possible have you
riot made a mistake

  no returned the captain in a stridulous whis-
per i have made no mistake im absolutely sure
if something is not done instantly we are lost
this is terrible returned cosmo taking his
head in his hands you say it is that fellow
campo i never liked his looks

  he is the ringleader replied the captain the
first suspicion of what he was up to came to me
through an old sailor who has been with me on many
a voyage he overheard campo talking with an-
other man and he listened trust an old seadog to
use his ears and keep himself out of notice

  and what did they say

  enough to freeze the marrow in your bones
campo proposed to begin by throwing old versal
and me into the sea and then he said with us gone
and nobody but a lot of muddle-headed scientists to
deal with it would be easy to take the ship seize
all the treasure in her make everybody who would
not join the mutiny walk the plank except the wo-
men and steer for some place where they could
land and lead a jolly life

   you see says campo this flood is a fake
there aint going to be no more flood its only a
shore wash but theres been enough of it to fix
things all right for us weve got the world in our
fist theres millions of money aboard this ship
and theres plenty of female beauty and weve only
got to reach out and take it 

  cosmo versals brow darkened as he listened and
a look that would have cowed the mutineers if they
could have seen it came into his eyes his hand
nervously clutched a paper-knife which broke in his
grasp as he said in a voice trembling with passion
they dont know me-you dont know me show
me the proofs of this conspiracy who are the
others campo and his friend cant be alone
alone exclaimed the captain unconsciously

raising his voice theres a dozen as black-handed
rascals in it as ever went unswung

  do you know them

  jim waters does

  why havent you told me sooner how long has
it been going on

  almost ever since the deluge stopped i think
but it was only last night that waters got on the
track of it and only now that he told me this fel-
low that waters heard campo talking to is plainly
a new recruit i say there are a dozen because
waters has found out that number but i dont
know but that there may be a hundred

  how did these wretches get aboard demanded
cosmo fiercely opening and shutting his fists

  excuse me said the captain but that is up
to you to say

  so it is replied cosmo with a grim look
and its up to me to say whatll become of them
i see how it is they must have got in with the
last lot that i took-under assumed names very
likely ive been more than once on the point of
calling that man campo up and questioning him
i was surprised by his hangdog look the first time
i saw him but i have been so busy

  youll have to get busy in another sense if you
mean to save this ship and your life said the
captain earnestly

  so i shall are you armed no then take
these-and use em when i give the word

  he handed the captain two heavy automatic
pistols and put a pair in his own sidepockets

  now he continued the first thing is to make
sure that weve got the right men-and all of them
call in joseph smith

  the captain went to the door and as he ap-
proached it there was a knock he turned the key
and cautiously opened a crack to look out the door
was instantly jerked open in his face six men
rushed in with campo a burly black-browed fel-
low at their head three of the men threw the
captain on his back and pinioned his hands before
he could draw a weapon while campo and the others
sprang toward cosmo versal campo pointing a pis-
tol at his head

  its all up mr versal cried campo with a
sneer ill take command of this ship and youll
go fish for nebulas

  cosmo had one advantage he was behind his
desk and it was a broad and long one and placed
almost against the wall they could not get at
him without getting round the desk campo did not
fire though he might have shot cosmo in his tracks
but evidently he was nourishing the idea of making
him walk the plank with a sign he commanded his
co-conspirators to flank the desk at each end while
he kept cosmo covered with his pistol

  but with a lightning movement cosmo dropped
under the desk and favored by his slight form and
his extreme agility darted like a cat past campos
legs and almost before the latter could turn round
was out of the open door campo fired at the re-
treating form but the bullet went wide of the
mark the pistol was practically noiseless and the
sound reached no ears in the staterooms

  it happened that a switch controlling the lights


amazing stories

in the gangway was on the wall by cosmos door
and in passing he swiftly reached up and turned it
off thus he was in complete darkness and when
campo darted out of the door he could not see the
fugitive he could hear his footsteps however and
with two of his companions he rushed blindly after
him firing two or three shots at random but
cosmo had turned at the first cross passage and
then at the next this part of the ark being a
labyrinth of corridors and the pursuers quickly
lost all trace of him

  campo and his companions made their way back
to cosmos cabin where their fellows were guard-
ing captain arms they found the switch in the
passage and turned on the light they were almost
immediately joined by several other conspirators
conducting joseph smith bound and gagged they
held a short consultation and campo with many
curses declared that cosmo versal must be caught
at all hazards

  the big-headed fiend he cried gnashing his
teeth let me get my grippers on him and ill
squelch him like a bug

  they threw joseph smith into the room beside
the helpless captain after taking the latters pistols
locked the door from the outside and hurried off
on their search in the passages they encountered
several more of their friends they now numbered
fifteen all armed this may seem a small number
to undertake to capture the ark but it must be
remembered that among the thousand-odd inmates
exclusive of the crew only about one in three was
a man and the majority of these were peaceable
scientists who it was to be presumed had no fight
in them

  at any rate campo with the reckless courage
of his kind felt confident that if he could get cosmo
versal with the captain and joseph smith out of
the way he could easily overmaster the others he
had not much fear of the crew for he knew that
they were not armed and he had succeeded in win-
ning over three of their number the only ones he
had thought at all dangerous because he had read
their character more than half the crew were
employed about the engines or on the animal deck
and most of the others were simply stewards who
would not stand before the pistols

  but while the mutineers were hurriedly search-
ing the corridors cosmo had run straight to the
bridge where he found two of his men in charge
and whence he sent an electric call to all the men
employed in the navigation of the vessel they
came running from various directions but a dozen
of them were caught in the passages by the
mutineers and bound before they could comprehend
what had happened seven however succeeded in
reaching the bridge and among these was jim
waters

  theres a mutiny said cosmo weve got to
fight for our lives have you got arms

  not one had a weapon except waters who dis-
played a pistol half as long as his arm

  here peterson take this said cosmo handing
a pistol to one of the two mariners who had been
on the bridge they will be here in a minute if

campo had been a sailor hed have had possession
here the first thing ill turn off all lights

  with that he pressed a button which put out
every lamp in the ark but there was a full moon
and they concealed themselves in the shadows

  presently they heard the mutineers approaching
stumbling and cursing in the darkness cosmo
directed peterson and waters to place themselves
at his side and told them to fire when he gave the
word

  the next instant four men appeared crossing a
moonlit place at the foot of the steps on the out-
side of the dome

  wait whispered cosmo the pistols go at a
pull we can sweep down a dozen in ten seconds
let them all get in sight first

  half a minute later there were twelve men climb-
ing the steps and cautiously looking up

  fire cried cosmo setting the example and
three streams of flame poured from the bridge
the sound of the bullets striking made more noise
than the explosions

  five or six of the men below fell knocking down
their comrades and a loud curse burst from the
lips of campo who had a bullet through his arm

  the mutineers tumbled in a heap at the bottom
and instantly cosmo switching on all lights led
the way down upon them his men who had no
arms seized anything they could get their hands
on that would serve to strike a blow and followed
him

  the conspirators were overwhelmed by the sud-
denness and fury of the attack

  four of them were killed outright and five were
wounded one so severely that he survived only a
few hours

  cosmos quick and overwhelming victory was due
to the fact that the mutineers in mounting the
steps could not see him and his men in the shadows
and when the automatic weapons which fired three
shots per second by repeated pressure of the trig-
ger from a chamber containing twenty-one car-
tridges once opened on them they could do nothing
in the hail of missiles especially when crowded
together on the steps

  campo was the only one who had any fight left
in him he struck cosmo a blow on the head that
felled him and then darted out upon the forepart
of the dome running on the cleats and made his
way to the top

  cosmo was on his feet in a second and rushing
in pursuit closely followed by jim waters the
fugitive ran for the ratlines leading to the lookout
pn the central mast he climbed them like a
squirrel and the man in the cronest amazed at the
sight below him stared at the approaching muti-
neer unable to utter a cry campo who as the
moonbeams showed now had a knife in his teeth
rapidly approached and the lookout shrank in terror
but before campo could reach the cronest a blind-
ing light dazzled his eyes cosmo had shouted an
order to peterson to run back to the bridge and turn
a search-light upon the mast then campo heard
a thundering voice below him

  take another step and ill blow you into the
seal
the second deluge



  he glanced below and saw cosmo and waters
covering him with their pistols

  not another step roared cosmo again come
down and ill give you a trial for your life

  campo hesitated but seeing that he could be
shot down and finding a gleam of hope in cosmos
words he turned and came slowly down the
moment he touched the bottom he was seized by
waters and another man and under cosmos direc-
tions his hands were bound behind his back

  ten minutes later the members of the crew who
had been caught by the mutineers in the gangways
were all unbound and then cosmo broke open the
door of his cabin the key having been lost or thrown
away by campo and the captain and joseph
smith were released

  well weve got em said cosmo grimly to the
captain the mutiny is at an end and therell
never be another

  in the meantime many of the passengers had been
aroused by the unaccustomed noises although the
pistols had not made enough sound to be heard from
the place where they were fired nightcapped
heads appeared on all sides and some in scanty
clothing were wandering in the passageways de-
manding what the trouble was cosmo the captain
and joseph smith reassured them saying that there
was no danger and that something had happened
which would be explained in the morning

  the prisoners-and the whole fifteen were finally
captured-were locked up in a strong-room and a
surgeon was sent to dress their wounds cosmo
versl and the captain resumed their accustomed
places on the bridge where they talked over the
affair and cosmo explained his plans for the mor-
row

  ill give him his trial as i promised cosmo
said in conclusion and youll see what it will be
mutiny aboard this ark and he struck the rail
a violent blow with his fist

  the next morning directly after breakfast cosmo
called all passengers and crew into the grand
saloon where many wondering looks were ex-
changed and many puzzling questions asked when
the mutineers with hands tied behind their backs
and their many bandages on arms and legs were
led in exclamations of astonishment were heard
and some of the timid ones shrank away in fear

  cosmo lost no time with preliminaries

  these men he said taking his stand upon the
platform have mutinied and tried to capture the
ark this fellow-pointing to campo-was the
concocter and leader of the plot he intended to
throw me and captain arms and all of you whom
he did not wish to retain for his fiendish purposes
into the sea but heaven has delivered them into
our hands i have promised them a trial and they
shall have it but it will be a trial in which justice
shall not be cheated i find that a moral poison has
stolen into this selected company and i will
eliminate it for once and all

  the expressions of amazement and alarm re-
doubled in intensity

  professor abel able professor jeremiah moses
sir wilfred athelstone costak theriade cosmo
continued you will please come forward to act

as members of the jury of which i name myself
also a member i shall be both judge and juror
here but i will hear what the rest of you may have
to say

  the men named stepped forward with some evi-
dences of embarrassment and cosmo gravely gave
them seats beside him then he commanded that
the prisoners should confront the jury and heavily
guarded they were led to the front

  the brutishness of campos face had never
struck the passengers who had seen him before as
it did now he looked a veritable jailbird at the
same time he was evidently in terror for his life
he muttered something which nobody understood

  cosmo who had informed himself of all the cir-
cumstances from waters and by privately question-
ing the others had satisfied himself that the entire
scheme of the mutiny was of campos contrivance
and that they had been led into it solely by his per-
suasion and threats ordered waters to speak the
seaman told a straight story of what he had heard
and seen cosmo himself then related the events of
the night when he had finished he turned to cam-
po and demanded what he had to say

  campo again muttered under his breath but
made no attempt to defend himself simply saying

  you promised me a trial

  and havent i given you a trial demanded
cosmo with flashing eyes you thought you held
the world in your grasp it is i that hold it in my
grasp and you too you were going to make us
walk that plank it is you who are going to wall
it is that the verdict turning to the four
jurymen

  some of them nodded some simply stared at cos-
mo surprised by the vehemence of his manner

  enough he said as to you addressing the
other prisoners you have had your lesson see that
you dont forget it release them and lead campo
to the promenade deck

  nobody thought that cosmo would literally exe-
cute his threat to make the mutineer walk the plank
but as he had told captain arms they didnt know
him they were about to see that in cosmo versdl
they had not only a prophet a leader and a judge
but an inexorable master also

  a plank was prepared and placed sloping from the
rail

  walk said cosmo firmly

  to everybodys surprise campo with blinded
eyes started immediately up the plank followed its
full length with quick unfaltering step and plung-
ing from the end disappeared in the sea

  many had turned away unable to look but many
also saw the tragedy to the end then a profound
sigh was heard from the whole company of the
spectators as they turned away talking in awed
voices they felt as never before that the world
had shrunk to the dimensions of the ark and that
cosmo versal was its dictator

  that same afternoon cosmo arranged one of his
conferences and nobody dared to be absent al-
though all minds were yet too much excited to fol-
low the discussions which few could understand
but at length costak theriade concentrated their
attention by a wild burst of eloquence about the


amazing stories

wonders of the inter-atomic forces sir athelstone
unable to endure the applause that greeted his rival
abruptly sprang to his feet his round face red with
anger and shouted

  i say you know this is twaddle

  will the englishman interrupt not cried
theriade with his eyes ablaze shall i project not
the sir englishman to the feeshes

  he looked as if he were about to try to execute
his threat and sir athelstone assumed a boxing
attitude but before hostilities could begin a loud
shout from the deck followed by cries and exclama-
tions caused everybody to rush out of the saloon

  those who succeeded in getting a glimpse over
the shoulders of the members of the crew who were
already lined up along the only portion of the bul-
warks available for seeing the part of the ocean on
which attention seemed to be fixed stared open-
mouthed at a round-backed mass of shining metal
with a circular aperture on the top the cover of
which was canted to one side and there stood a man
waving a gold-laced red kepi and bowing and smil-
ing with great civility

chapter xvii

the jules verne

the swell of the sea caused the strange look-
ing craft to rise and sink a little and some-
times the water ran bubbling all around the
low rim of the aperture in the center of which the
red-capped man stood resting on some invisible
support repeating his salutations and amicable
smiles and balancing his body to the rocking of
the waves with the unconscious skill of a sailor

  the ark was running slowly but it would very
soon have left the stranger in its wake if he had
not also been in motion it was evident that the ob-
ject under his feet must be a submersible vessel of
some kind although it was of a type which captain
arms standing beside cosmo on the bridge de-
clared that he had never set eyes on before it lay
so low in the water that nothing could be seen of
its motive machinery but it kept its place alongside
the ark with the ease of a dolphin and gradually
edged in closer

  when it was so near that he could be heard speak-
ing in a voice hardly raised above the ordinary
pitch the man first again lifting his cap with an
elegant gesture addressed cosmo versal by name
using the english language with a scarcely per-
ceptible accent

  m versal i offer you my felicitations upon the
magnificent appearance of your ark and i present
my compliments to the ladies and gentlemen of your
company

  and then he bowed once more to the passengers
who were almost crowding each other over the side
in their eagerness to both see and hear

  thank you responded cosmo but who are
you

  capitaine ives de beauxchamps of the french
army

  wheres the navy then blurted out captain
arms

  de beauxchamps glanced at the speaker a little
disdainfully and then replied gravely

  alas at the bottom of the sea-with all the
other navies

  and how have you escaped demanded cosmo
versal

  as you see in a submersible

  can it be possible exclaimed cosmo and
you have been in the sea ever since the beginning
of the flood

  since the first rise of the ocean on the coast of
brest

  have you no companions

  six-in truth seven

  astonishing said cosmo versal but i heard
nothing of the preparation of a submersible in
fact the idea of such a thing never occun-ed to me
you must have made your preparations secretly
we did we did not share your certainty m
versal concerning the arrival of a deluge even
when we embarked we were not sure that it would
be more than an affair of the coasts

  but you must be on the point of starvation by
this time the flood has only begun this cessation
is but for a time while we are passing a gap in the
nebula you will come aboard the ark i had chosen
my company but your gallant escape and the abil-
ity that you have shown prove that you are worthy
to aid in the reestablishment of the race and i have
no doubt that your companions are equally worthy
the frenchman bowed politely and with a slight
smile replied

  i believe m versal that the jules verne is as
safe and comfortable and proportionately as well
provisioned as your ark

  so you call it the jules verne returned cosmo
smiling in his turn

  we were proud to give it that name and its con-
duct has proved that it is worthy of it

  but you will surely come aboard and shake
hands and let us offer you a little hospitality said
cosmo

  i should be extremely happy to pay my compli-
ments to the ladies responded de beauxchamps
but i must postpone that pleasure for the present
in the meantime however i should be glad if you
would lower a landing stage and permit me to
send aboard the seventh member of our party who
i venture to think may find the ark a more com-
fortable abode than our submersible

  and who may that person be

  the king of england

  yes resumed the frenchman we picked up
his majesty the first day after the deluge began to
descend from the sky

  exclamations of surprise and wonder were heard
on all sides

  i will lower a ladder at once cosmo called out
and immediately ran down to the lowest deck com-
manding his men to make haste

  the jules verne was skilfully brought close up to
the side of the ark so that the visible part of her
rounded back was nearly in contact with the bottom
of the companion-ladder when it was lowered the
sea was so calm that there was little difficulty in
executing this maneuver de beauxchamps disap-
the second deluge



peared in the depths of the submersible and after a
few minutes reemerged into sight supporting on
his arm a stout rather short man whose face it
was evident had once been full and ruddy but now
it was pale and worn

  it is he exclaimed an english member of
cosmos company to some of his fellow countrymen
who had forced their way to the front

   it is the icing

  and then occurred a singular thing inspired by
the marvelous circumstances of this meeting of the
sovereign of a drowned kingdom upon the bosom
of the waters that had destroyed it with the mere
handful that remained alive out of all the millions
of his subjects

  these loyal english people bared their heads and
there were three women among them and sang
with a pathos that surely the old hymn had never
expressed before their national anthem god save
the king

  the effect was immense every head aboard the
ark was immediately uncovered de beauxchamps
removed his cap and one or two bared heads could
be seen peering out of the interior of the submer-
sible below him as the king was steadied across
to the bottom of the companion-ladder the voices
of the singers rose louder and many of the other
passengers moved by sympathy or carried away
by epidemic feeling joined in the singing never
had any monarch a greeting like that its recipient
was moved to the depths of his soul and but for the
aid given him would have been unable to ascend the
swaying steps

  as he was assisted upon the deck the song
ceased and a great cheer broke forth there were
tears in his eyes and he trembled in every limb
when he returned the welcoming pressure of cosmo
versals hand

  the moment he saw that the king was safely
aboard the ark de beauxchamps with a farewell
salutation disappeared into the interior of the
jules verne and the submersible sank out of sight
as gently as if it had been a huge fish that had come
to the top of the sea to take a look about

  after the sensation caused by the arrival of the
english monarch aboard the ark had somewhat
quieted down and after his majesty had had an op-
portunity to recover himself cosmo versal invited
his new guest to tell the story of his escape they
were seated in cosmos cabin and there were pres-
ent joseph smith professor jeremiah moses pro-
fessor abel able and amos blank besides several
other members of the ships company including two
of the loyal englishmen who had been the first to
strike up the national anthem on seeing their res-
cued king

  richard edward or richard iv as he was official-
ly entitled was one of the best kings england ever
had he was popular not only because of his almost
democratic manners and the simplicity of his life
but more because he was a great lover of peace
we have already seen how he was chosen solely on
that account to be of the number of the rulers in-
vited to go in the ark he had not even replied to
cosmos invitation but that was simply because
like everybody about him in whom he placed con-

fidence he regarded cosmo versal as a mere
mountebank and thought that there was no more
danger of a universal flood than of the fall of the
moon out of the sky

  before responding to cosmos request he made a
gracious reference to the indifference with which
he had formerly treated his present host

  i am sorry mr versal he said with a depreca-
tory smile that i did not sooner recognize the fact
that your knowledge surpassed that of my scientific
advisers

  your majesty was not alone replied cosmo
gravely turning with his fingers a small globe that
stood on his desk from all these deep-sunken
continents waving his hand toward the globe
if the voices once heard there could now speak
there would arise a mighty sound of lament for that
error

  the king looked at him with an expression of
surprise he glanced from cosmos diminutive fig-
ure to his great overhanging brow marked with
the lines of thought and a look of instinctive def-
erence came into his eyes

  but continued cosmo versal it is bootless to
speak of these things now i beg that your majesty
will condescend to enlighten us concerning the
fate of that great kingdom of ancient renown over
which you so worthily reigned

  an expression of deepest pain passed across the
face of richard edward for some moments he re-
mained buried in a mournful silence and many
sighs came from his breast all looked at him with
profound commiseration at last he raised his head
and said sorrowfully and brokenly

  my kingdom is drowned-my subjects have
perished almost to the last soul-my family my
gracious consort my children-all all-gone

  here he broke down and could speak no more
not a word was spoken for a time and the two
englishmen present wept with their unfortunate
king

  cosmo versal was no less deeply moved than the
others he sat for a while in complete silence
then he arose and going to the king put his hand
upon his shoulder and talked to him long in a low
consoling voice at last the broken-spirited mon-
arch was able to suppress his emotions sufficiently
to recite but with many interruptions while he
regained mastery of his feelings the story of his
woes and of his marvelous escape

  sir francis brook he said prepared a barge
when the water invaded london and in that barge
we escaped-her royal majesty our children and
a number of members of the royal household-the
barge was the only vessel of levium that existed in
england sir francis had furnished and provis-
ioned it well and we did not think that it would
be necessary to go farther than to some high point
in the interior sir francis was of the opinion
that wales would afford a secure refuge

  it was a terrible thing to see the drowning of
london the sweeping of the awful bore that came
up the thames from the sea the shipping wrecked
by the tearing waves the swirl of the fast-rising
water round the immense basin in which the city
lay the downfall of the great buildings-westmin-


amazing stories

ster abbey was one of the first that succumbed-
the overturned boats and even great vessels float-
ing on their sides or bottom up the awful spectacle
of the bodies of the drowned tossing in the waves-
all these sights were before our horrified eyes while
the vast eddy swept us round and round until the
water rose so high that we were driven off toward
the southwest

  that we should have escaped at all was a mir-
acle of miracles it was the wonderful buoyancy of
the levium barge that saved us but the terrors of
that scene can never fade from my memory and
the fearful sufferings of the queen  and our child-
ren-but i cannot go on with this 

  calm yourself your majesty said cosmo
sympathetically the whole world has suffered
with you if we are spared and are yet alive it is
through the hand of providence-to whom we must
bow

  we must have passed over surrey and hamp-
shire the king resumed the invasion of the sea
having buried the hills

  i am surprised at that said cosmo i did not
think that the sea had anywhere attained so great
an elevation before the nebula condensed at new
fork the complete drowning of the city did not
occur until the downpour from the sky began
oh that deluge from the heavens cried the
king what we had suffered before seemed but
little in comparison it came upon us after night
and the absolute darkness the awful roaring the
terrific force of the falling water the sense of suf-
focation the rapid filling of the barge until the
water was about our necks-these things drove us
wild with despair

  i tried to sustain my poor queen in my arms
but she struggled to seize the children and hold
them above the water and in her efforts she escaped
from my hands and thenceforth i could find her no
more i stumbled about but it was impossible to
see it was impossible to be heard at last i fell un-
conscious face downward as it afterward appeared
upon a kind of bench at the rear end of the barge
which was covered with a narrow metallic roofing
and raised above the level of the bulwarks it was
there that i had tried to shelter the queen and the
children

  in some way i must have become lodged there
under the awning in such a position that the pitch-
ing of the barge failed to throw me off i never re-
gained consciousness until i heald a voice shouting
in my ear and felt some one pulling me and when
i had recovered my senses i found myself in the
submersible

  and all your companions were gone asked
cosmo in a voice shaking with pity

  yes oh lord all they have been swept over-
board by the waves-and would that i had gone
with them

  the poor king broke down again and sobbed
after a long pause cosmo asked gently

  did the frenchman tell you how he came upon
the barge

  he said that in rising to the surface to find out
the state of things there the submersible came up
directly under the barge canting it in such a way

that i was rolled out and he caught me as i was
swept close to the opening

  but how was it that the downpour entering the
submersible when the cover was removed did not
fill it with water

  he had the cover so arranged that it served as
an almost complete protection from the rain some
water did enter but not much

  a wonderful man that frenchman said cos-
mo he would be an acquisition for me what
did he say his name was oh yes de beauxchamps
-ill make a note of that i shouldnt wonder if we
heard of him again

  cosmo versal was destined to encounter ives de
beauxchamps and his wonderful submersible jules
verne sooner and under more dramatic circum-
stances than he probably anticipated

chapter xviii

navigating over drowned europe

after the english king had so strangely be-
come a member of its company the ark re-
sumed its course in the direction of what had
once been europe the spot where the meeting
with the jules verne had occurred was west of cape
finisterre and according to the calculations of
captain arms in longitude fifteen degrees four
minutes west latitude forty-four degrees nine
minutes north

  cosmo decided to run into the bay of biscay
skirting its southern coast in order to get a view
of the cantabrian mountains many of whose
peaks he thought ought still to lie well above the
level of the water

  there are the peaks of europa said captain
arms which lie less than twenty miles directly
back from the coast the highest point is eight
thousand six hundred and seventy feet above sea
level or what used to be sea level we could get
near enough to it without any danger to see how
high the water goes

  do you know the locality demanded cosmo
as well as i know a compass-card exclaimed
the captain ive seen the europa peaks a hun-
dred times i was wrecked once on that coast and
being of an inquiring disposition i took the op-
portunity to go up into the range and see the old
mines-and a curious sight it was too but the
most curious sight of all was the shepherdesses of
tresvido dressed just like the men in homespun
breeches that never wore out youd meet em any
where on the slopes of the pico del ferro cruising
about with their flocks and the cheese that they
made there never was any such cheese

  well if you know the place so well said cosmo
steer for it as fast as you can im curious to find
out just how high this flood has gone up to the
present moment

  maybe we can rescue a shepherdess returned
the captain chuckling shed be an ornament to
your new garden of eden

  they kept on until as they approached longitude
five degrees west they began to get glimpses of the
mountains of northern spain the coast was all
under deep water and also the foot-hills and lower
the second deluge



ranges but some of the peaks could be made out far
inland at length by cautious navigation captain
arms got the vessel quite close to the old shore line
of the asturias and then he recognized the europa
peaks

  there they are he cried id know em if
theyd emigrated to the middle of africa theres
the old torre de cerredo and the pena santa

  how high did you say the main peak is asked
cosmo

  shes eight thousand six hundred and seventy
feet

  from your knowledge of the coast do you think
it safe to run in closer

  yes if youre sure the water is not less than
two thousand four hundred feet above the old level
we can get near enough to see the water-line on the
peaks from the cro-nest which is two hundred
feet high

  go ahead then

  they got closer than they had imagined possible
so close that from the highest lookout on the ark
they were able with their telescopes to see very
clearly where the water washed the barren moun-
tainsides at what seemed to be a stupendous eleva-
tion

  im sorry about your shepherdesses said cos-
mo smiling i dont think youd find any there to
rescue if you could get to them they must all have
been lost in the torrents that poured down those
mountains

  mores the pity said captain arms that was
a fine lot of women therell be no more cheese like
what they made at tresvido

  cosmo inquired if the captains acquaintance with
the topography of the range enabled him to say how
high that water was the captain after long in-
spection declared that he felt sure that it was not
less than four thousand feet above the old coast
line

  then said cosmo if youre right about the
elevation of what you call the torre de cerredo
there must be four thousand six hundred and
seventy feet of its upper part still out of water
well see if that is so

  cosmo made the measurements with his instru-
ments and announced that the result showed the
substantial accuracy of captain arms guess

  i suspected as much he muttered those tre-
mendous downpours which may have been worse
elsewhere than where we encountered them have
increased the rise nearly seventy per cent above
what my gages indicated now that i know this
he continued addressing the captain ill change
the course of the ark im anxious to get into the
indian ocean as soon as possible it would be a
great waste of time to go hack in order to cross the
sahara and with this increase of level it isnt nec-
essary well just set out across southern france
keeping along north of the pyrenees and so down
into the region of the mediterranean

  captain arms was astonished by the boldness of
this suggestion and at first he strongly objected to
their taking such a course

  theres some pretty high ground in southern
france he said theres the cevennes moun

tains which approach a good long way toward the
pyrenees are you sure the depth of water is the
same everywhere

  what a question for an old mariner to ask
returned cosmo dont you know that the level of
the sea is the same everywhere the flood doesnt
make any difference it seeks its level like any
other water

  but it may be risky steering between those
mountains persisted the captain

  nonsense as long as the sky is clear you can
get good observations and you ought to be navi-
gator enough not to run on a mountain

  cosmo versal as usual was unalterable in his
resolution-he only changed when he had reasons
of his own-and the course of the ark was laid ac-
cordingly for the old french coast of the landes
so low that it was now covered with nearly four
thousand feet of water the feelings of the passen-
gers were deeply stirred when they learned that
they were actually sailing over buried europe and
they gazed in astonishment at the water beneath
them peering down into it as if they sought to dis-
cover the dreadful secrets that it hid and talking
excitedly in a dozen languages

  the ark progressed slowly making not more than
five or six knots and on the second day after they
dropped the penas de europa they were passing
along the northern flank of the pyrenees and over
the basin in which had lain the beautiful city of
pau the view of the pyrenees from this point had
always been celebrated as one of the most remark-
able in the world

  now it had lost its beauty but gained in spectac-
ular grandeur all of france as far as the eye ex-
tended was a sea with long oceanic swells slowly
undulating its surface this sea abruptly came to
an end where it met the mountains which formed
for it a coast unlike any that the hundreds of eyes
which wonderingly surveyed it from the ark had
ever beheld

  beyond the drowned vales and submerged ranges
which they knew lay beneath the watery floor be-
fore them rose the heads of the pic du midi the
pic de ger the pic de bigorre the massif du
gabizos the pic monn and dozens of other famous
eminences towering in broken ranks like the bear-
skins of a forlorn hope resisting to the last in
pictures of old-time battles

  here owing to the configuration of the drowned
land it was possible for the ark to approach quite
close to some of the wading mountains and cosmo
seized the opportunity to make a new measure of the
height of the flood which he found to be surely not
less than his former estimates had shown

  surveying with telescopes the immense shoulders
of the monne the vicos the dardiden and the
nearer heights whep they were floating above the
valley of lourdes cosmo and the captain saw the
terrible effects that had been produced by the tor-
rents of rain which had stripped off the vegetation
whose green robe had been the glory of the high
pyrenees on the french side

  presently their attention was arrested by some
moving objects and at a second glance they per-
ceived that there were human beings


amazing stories

  good heaven exclaimed cosmo versal there
are survivors here they have climbed the moun-
tains and found shelter among the rocks i should
not have thought it possible

  and there are women among them said cap-
tain arms lowering his telescope you will not
leave them there

  but what can i do

  lower away the boats replied the captain
weve got plenty of them

  there may be thousands there returned cos-
mo musing i cant take them all

  then take as many as you can by gad sir iu
not leave em

  by this time somp of the passengers who had
powerful glasses had discovered the refugees on
the distant heights and great excitement spread
throughout the ark cries arose from all parts oi
the vessel

  rescue them go to their aid dont let
them perish

  cosmo versal was in a terrible quandary he was
hy no means without humanity and was capable
of deep and sympathetic feeling as we have seen
but he already had as many persons in the ark as
he thought ought to be taken considering the pro-
vision that had been made and besides he could
not throw off at once his original conviction of the
necessity of carefully choosing his companions he
remained for a long time buried in thought while
the captain fumed with impatience and at last de-
clared that if cosmo did not give the order to lower
away the boats he would do it himself

  at length cosmo yielding rather to his own hu-
mane feelings than to the urging of others con-
sented to make the experiment half a dozen levi-
um launches were quickly lowered and sent off
while the ark with slowed engines remained de-
scribing a circle as near the mountains as it was
safe to go cosmo himself embarked in the leading
boat

  the powerful motors of the launches carried them
rapidly to the high slopes where the unfortunates
had sought refuge and as they approached and the
poor fugitives saw that deliverance was at hand
they began to shout and cheer and cry and many
of them fell on their knees upon the rocks and
stretched their hands toward the heavens

  the launches were compelled to move with great
caution when they got near the ragged sides of the
submerged mountains it was the peyre dufau on
which the people had taken refuge but the men
aboard them were determined to effect the rescue
and they regarded no peril too closely at last
cosmos launch found a safe landing and the others
quickly followed it

  when cosmo sprang out on a flat rock a crowd
of men women and children weeping crying sob-
bing and uttering prayers and blessings instantly
surrounded him some wrung his hand in an
ecstasy of joy some embraced him some dropped on
their knees before him and sought to kiss his hands
cosmo could not restrain his tears and the crews
of the launches were equally affected

  many of these people could only speak the patois
of the mountains but some were refugees from the

resorts in the valleys below and among these were
two english tourists who had been caught among
the mountains by the sudden rising of the flood
they exhibited comparative sang froid and served
as spokesmen for the others

  bah jove exclaimed one of them but youre
welcome you know this has been a demnition
close call but what kind of a craft have you got
out there

  im cosmo versal

  then thats the ark weve heard about pon
honor i should have recognized you for ive seen
your picture often enough youve come to take us
off i suppose

  certainly replied cosmo how many are
there

  all that you see here about a hundred i should
say no doubt there are others on the mountains
round there must have been a thousand of us
when we started but most of them perished over-
come by the downpour or swept away by the tor-
rents lord swansdown indicating his compan-
ion who bowed gravely and stiffly and myself-
im edward whistlington-set out to walk over
the pyrenees from end to end after the excitement
about the great darkness died out and we got as far
as the marbore and then running down to gavarnie
we heard news of the sea rising but we didnt give
too much credit to that and afterward keeping up
in the heights we didnt hear even a rumor from
the world below

  the sky opened on us like a broadside from an
aerial squadron and how we ever managed to get
here im sure i can hardly tell we were actually
carried down the mountainsides by the water and
how it failed to drown us will be an everlasting
mystery somehow we found ourselves among
these people who were trying to go up assuring
us that there was nothing but water below and at
last we discovered some sort of shelter here-and
here weve been ever since

  you cannot have had much to eat said cosmo
not too much i assure you replied the english-
man with a melancholy smile but these people
shared with us what little they had or could find-
anything and everything that was eatable theyre
a devilish fine lot i tell you

  when the terrible rain suddenly ceased and the
sky cleared he resumed we managed to get dry
after a day or two and since then weve been chew-
ing leather until there isnt a shoe or a belt left
we thought at first of trying to build rafts-but
then where could we go it wasnt any use to sail
out over a drowned country with nothing in sight
but the mountains around us which looked no bet-
ter than the one we were barely existing on

  then i must get you aboard the ark before you
starve said cosmo

  many have died of starvation already returned
whistlington you cant get us off too quick
cosmo versal had by this time freed himself of
every trace of the reluctance which he had at first
felt to increasing the size of his ships company by
adding recruits picked up at random his sym-
pathies were thoroughly aroused and while he has-
tened the loading and departure of the launches he
the second deluge



asked the englishmen who with the impassive en-
durance of their race stayed behind to the last
whether they thought that there were other refu-
gees on the mountains whom they could reach

  i dare say there are thousands of the poor devils
on these peaks around us wandering among the
rocks replied edward whistlington but i fancy
you couldnt reach em

  if i see any ill try returned cosmo sweeping
with his telescope all the mountain flanks within
view

  at last on the slopes of the lofty mont aigu
across the submerged valley toward the south he
caught sight of several human figures one of which
was plainly trying to make signals probably to at-
tract attention from the ark immediately with
the englishmen and the remainder of those who had
been found on the peyre dufau he hastened in his
launch to the rescue

  they found four men and three women who had
escaped from the narrow valley containing the
bains de gazost and who were in the last stages of
starvation these were taken aboard and then no
more being in sight cosmo returned to the ark
where the other launches had already arrived

  and these were the last that were rescued from
the mighty range of the pyrenees in whose deep
valleys had lain the famous resorts of cauterets
the eaux bonnes the eaux chaudes the bagnieres
de luchon the bagnieres de bigorre and a score of
others no doubt as the englishmen had said
thousands had managed to climb the mountains but
none could now be seen and those who may have
been there were left to perish

  there was great excitement in the ark on the
arrival of the refugees the passengers over-
whelmed them with kind attentions and when they
had sufficiently recovered listened with wonder and
the deepest sympathy to their tales of suffering
and terror

  lord swansdown and edward whistlington were
amazed to find their king aboard the ark and the
english members of the company soon formed a
sort of family party presided over by the unfortu-
nate monarch the rescued persons numbered in all
one hundred and six

  the voyage of the ark was now resumed skirt-
ing the pyrenees but at an increasing distance
finally captain arms announced that according
to his observations they were passing over the site
of the ancient and populous city of toulouse this
recalled to cosmo versals memory the beautiful
scenes of the fair and rich land that lay so deep
under the ark and he began to talk with the cap-
tain about the glories of its history

  he spoke of the last great conqueror that the
world had known napoleon and was discussing
his marvelous career and referring to the fact that
he had died on a rock in the midst of that very
ocean whicli had now swallowed up all the scenes
of his conquests when the lookout telephoned down
that there was something visible on the water
ahead

  in a little while they saw it-a small moving ob-
ject which rapidly approached the ark as it drew
nearer both exclaimed at once

  the jules verne here comes the jules verne
there could be no mistaking it it was riding
with its back just above the level of the sea the
french flag was fluttering from a small mast and
already they could perceive the form of de beaux-
champs standing in his old attitude with his feet
below the rim of the circular opening at the top
cosmo ordered the stars and stripes to be displayed
in salute and greatly pleased over the encounter
hurried below and had the companion-ladder made
ready

  hes got to come aboard this time anyhow
he exclaimed ill take no refusal i want to know
that fellow better

  but this time de beauxchamps had no thought of
refusing the hospitalities of the ark as soon as
he was within hearing he called out

  my salutations to m versal and his charming
fellow voyagers may i be permitted to come aboard
and present myself in person i have something
deeply interesting to tell

  everybody in the ark who could find a stand-
ing-place was watching the jules verne and trying
to catch a glimpse of its gallant captain and to hear
what he said and the moment his request was pre-
ferred a babel of voices arose amid which could be
distinguished such exclamations as

  let him come a fine fellow welcome
de beauxchamps hurrah for the jules verne
king richard was in the fore rank of the specta-
tors waving his hand to his preserver

  certainly you can come aboard cried cosmo
heartily at the same time hastening the prepara-
tions for lowering the ladder we are all glad to
see you and bring your companions along with
you

chapter xix

to paris under the sea

de beauxchamps accepted cosmo versals
invitation to bring his companions with
him into the ark the submersible was
safely moored alongside where she rode easily in
company with the larger vessel and all mounted
the companion-ladder the frenchmans six com-
panions were dressed like himself in the uniform
of the army

  curious muttered captain arms in cosmos
ear that these soldiers should be the only ones to
get off-and in a vessel too what were the sea-
men about

  what were our seamen about returned cosmo
how many of them got off i warned them that
ships would not do but it was a bright idea of
thisde beauxchamps and his friends to build a
submersible it didnt occur to me or i would have
advised their construction everywhere for small
parties but it would never have done for us a
submersible would not have been capacious enough
for the party i wanted to take

  by this time the visitors were aboard and cosmo
and the others who could get near enough to grasp
them by the hand greeted them effusively king
richard received de beauxchamps with emotion
and thanked him again and again for having saved


amazing stories

his life but in the end he covered his face and
said in a broken voice

  m de beauxchamps my gratitude to you is very
deep-but oh the queen-the queen-and the
children i should have done better to perish with
them

  cosmo and de beauxchamps soothed him as well
as they could and the former led the way into the
grand saloon in order that as many as possible
might see and greet their visitors who had come so
mysteriously up out of the sea

  all of the frenchmen were as affable as their
leader and he presented them in turn de beaux-
champs conversed almost gaily with such of the
ladies as had sufficient command of their feelings to
join the throng that pressed about him and his
companions he was deeply touched by the story
of the recent rescue of his countrymen from the
pyrenees and he went among them trying to cheer
them up with the sian that no misfortune can eradi-
cate from the gallic nature

  at length cosmo reminded him that he had said
that he had some interesting news to communicate

  yes said de beauxchamps i have just come
from a visit to paris

  exclamations of amazement and incredulity were
heard on all sides

  it is true resumed the frenchman though
now his voice lostall its gaiety i had conceived
the project of such a visit before i met the ark and
transferred his majesty the king of england to
vour care as soon as that was done i set out to
iiake the attempt

  but tell me first interrupted cosmo how you
succeeded in finding the ark again

  that was not very difficult replied de beaux-
champs smiling of course it was to some extent
accidental for i didnt know that you would be
here navigating over france but i had an idea that
you might come this way if you had an intention of
seeing what had happened to europe it is my reg-
ular custom to rise frequently to the surface to take
a look around and make surer of my bearings and
you know that the ark makes a pretty large point
on the waters i saw it long before you caught sight
of me

  very well said cosmo please go on with
your story it must indeed be an extraordinary
one

  i was particularly desirous of seeing paris
again deep as i knew her to lie under the waves
resumed de beauxchamps because it was my home
and i had a house in the champs elyses you can-
not divorce the heart of a frenchman from his
home though you should bury it under twenty
oceans

  your family were lost

  thank god i had no family if i had had they
would be with me my companions are all like my-
self in that respect we have lost many friends
but no hear relatives as i was saying i started
for france poor drowned france as soon as i left
you with the powerful search-light of the jules
verne i could feel confident of avoiding obstruc-
tions and besides i knew very closely the height
to which the flood had risen and having the topo-

graphy of my country at my fingers ends as does
every officer of the army i was able to calculate the
depth at which we should run in order to avoid the
hilltops

  but surely said cosmo it is impossible-at
least it seems so to me-that you can descend to
any great depth-the pressure must be tremendous
a few hundred feet down to say nothing of pos-
sible thousands

  all that replied the frenchman has been
provided for you probably do not know to what
extent we had carried experiments in france on
the deep submersion of submarines before their
general abandonment when they were prohibited
by international agreement in war i was myself
perhaps the leader in those investigations and in
the construction of the jules verne i took pains to
improve on all that had hitherto been done

  without going into any description of my de-
vices i may simply remind you that nature has
pointed out ways of avoiding the consequences of
the inconceivable pressures which calculation indi-
cates at depths of a kilometer or more in her con-
struction of the deep-sea fishes it was by a study
of them that i arrived at the secret of both pene-
trating to depths that would theoretically have
seemed entirely impossible and of remaining at such
depths

  marvelous exclaimed cosmo marvelous be-
yond belief

  i may add continued de beauxchamps smiling
at the effect that his words had had upon the mind
of the renowned cosmo versal that the peculiar
properties of levium which you so wisely chose for
your ark aided me in quite a different way but i
must return to my story

  we passed over the coast of france near the
point where i knew lay the mouth of the loire i
could have found my way by means of the com-
pass sufficiently well but since the sky was clear i
frequently came to the surface in order for greater
certainty to obtain sights of the sun and stars

  i dropped down at tours and at blois and we
plainly saw the walls of the old chateaux in the
gleam of the search-light below us there were
monsters of the deep such as the eye of man never
beheld swimming slowly about them many of them
throwing a strange luminosity into the water from
their phosphorescent organs as if they were in-
specting these novelties of the sea-bottom

  arriving over orleans we turned in the direc-
tion of paris as we approached the site of the city
i sank the submersible until we almost touched the
higher hills my search-light is so arranged that
it can be directed almost eveiy way-up down to
this side and to that-and we swept it round us in
every direction

  the light readily penetrated the water and re-
vealed sights which i have no power to describe
and some-reminders of the immense population
of human beings which had there met its end-
which i would not describe if i could to see a
drowned face suddenly appear outside the window
almost within touch-ah that was too horrible

  we passed over versailles with the old palace
still almost intact over sevres with its porcelain
the second deluge



manufactory yet in part standing-the tidal waves
that had come up the river from the sea evidently
caused much destruction just before the downpour
began-and finally we entered paris

  we could see the embankments of the seine be-
neath us as we passed up its course from the point
du jour from the site of the champ de mars i
turned northward in search of the older part of
the champs elysees where my house was and we
came upon the great arc de triomphe which you
remember dates from the time of napoleon

  it was apparently uninjured even the huge
bronze groups remaining in their places and the
search-light traversing its face fell upon the heroic
group of the marseillaise on the east facade you
must have seen that m versal

  yes many a time cosmo replied the fury
in the face of the female figure representing the
spirit of war chanting the marseillaise and
sword in hand sweeping over the heads of the
soldiers is the most terrible thing of human making
that i ever looked upon

  it was not so terrible as another thing that our
startled eyes saw there said de beauxchamps
coiled round the upper part of the arch with its
head resting directly upon that of the figure of
which you speak was a monstrous ribbon-shaped
creature whose flat reddish body at least a meter
in width and apparently thirty meters long and
bordered with a sort of floating frill of a pinkish
color undulated with a motion that turned us sick
at heart

  but the head was the most awful object that the
fancy of a madman could conceive there were two
great round projecting eyes encircled with what
i suppose must have been phosphorescent organs
which spread around in the water a green light that
was absolutely horrifying

  i turned away the search-light and the eyes of
that creature stared straight at us with a dread-
ful stony look and then the effect of the phos-
phorescence heightened by the absence of the
greater light became more terrible than before
we were unmanned and i hardly had nerve enough
to turn the submersible away and hurry from the
neighborhood

  i had not supposed said cosmo that creatures
of such a size could live in the deeper parts of the
sea

  i know returned de beauxchamps that many
have thought that the abysmal creatures were
generally of small size but they knew nothing about
it what could one have expected to learn of the
secrets of life in the ocean depths from the small
creatures which alone the trawls brought to the
surface the great monsters could not be captured
in that way but we have seen them-seen them
taking possession of beautiful drowned paris-and
we know what they are

  the fascinated hearers who had crowded about
to listen to the narrative of de beauxchamps shud-
dered at this part of it and some of the women
turned away with exclamations of horror

  i see that i am drawing my picture in too
fearful colors he said and i shall refrain from
telling of the other inhabitants of the abyss that

we found in possession of what i as a frenchman
must call the most splendid capital that the world
contained

   oh to think that all that beauty all those great
palaces filled with the masterworks of art all those
proud architectural piles all that scene of the most
joyous life that the earth contained is now become
the dwelling-place of the terrible fauna of the deep
creatures that never saw the sun that never felt
the transforming force of the evolution which had
made the face of the globe so glorious that never
quitted their abysmal homes until this awful flood
spread their empire over the whole earth

  there was a period of profound silence while de
beauxchampss face worked spasmodically under
the influence of emotions the sight of which would
alone have sufficed to convince his hearers of the
truth of what he had been telling finally cosmo
versal breaking the silence asked

  did you find your home

   yes it was there i found it out i illuminated
it with the search-light i gazed into the broken
windows trying to peer through the watery medium
that filled and darkened the interior the roof
was broken but the walls were intact i thought
of the happy happy years that i had passed there
when i had a family and when paris was an eden
the sunshine of the world and then i wished to
see no more and we rose out of the midst of that
sunken city and sought the daylight far above

   i had thought to tell you he continued after
a pause of the condition in which we found the
great monuments of the city-of the pantheon yet-
standing on its hill with its roof crushed in of
notre dame-a wreck but the towers still standing
proudly of the old palace of the louvre through
whose broken roofs and walls we caught glimpses
of the treasures washed by the water within-but i
find that i have not courage to go on i had
imagined that it would be a relief to speak of these
things but i do not find it so

  after leaving paris then you made no other
explorations said cosmo

  none i would have had no heart for more

i had seen enough and yet i do not regret that i
went there i should never have been content not
to have seen my beautiful city once more even lying
in her watery shroud i loved her living i have
seen her dead it is finished what more is there
m versal with a sudden change of manner
you have predicted all this and perhaps you know
more where do we go to die

  we shall not die replied cosmo versal force-
fully the ark and your jides verne will save us
to what purpose demanded the frenchman
his animation all gone can there be any plea-
sure in floating upon or beneath the waves that
cover a lost world is a brief prolongation of such
a life worth the effort of grasping for

   yes said cosmo with still greater energy we
may still save the race i have chosen most of my
companions in the ark for that purpose not only
may we save the race of man but we may lead it up
upon a higher plane we may apply the principles
of eugenics as they have never yet been applied
you m de beauxchamps have shown that you are


amazing stories

of the stock that is required for the regeneration of
the world

   but where can the world be regenerated asked
de beauxchamps with a bitter laugh there is
nothing left but mountain-tops

   even they will be covered said cosmo

   do you mean that the deluge has not yet reached
its height

   certainly it has not we are in an open space in
the enveloping nebula after a little we shall enter
the nucleus and then will come the worst

   and yet you talk of saving the race exclaimed
the frenchman with another bitter laugh

   i do replied cosmo and it will be done
   but how

   through the reemergence of land

   that recalls our former conversation put in
professor abel able it appears to me impossible
that when the earth is once covered with a univer-
sal ocean it can ever disappear or materially lower
its level geological ages would be required for
the level of the water to be lowered even a few
feet by the escape of vapor into space

  no returned cosmo versal i have demon-
strated that that idea is wrong under the immense
pressure of an ocean rising six miles above the
ancient sea level the water will rapidly be forced
into the interstices of the crust and thus a ma-
terial reduction of level will be produced within a
few years-five at the most that will give us
a foothold i have no doubt that even now the
water around us is slightly lowering through that
cause

   ut in itself that will not be sufficient i have
gone all over this ground in my original calcula-
tions the intrusion of the immense mass of ocean
water into the interior of the crust of the earth will
result in a grand geological upheaval the lands
will reemerge above the new sea level as they
emerged above the former one through the internal
stresses of the globe

   the scientific men present listened with breath-
less interest but some of them with many incredul-
ous shakings of the head

  you must be aware continued cosmo ad-
dressing them particularly that it has been demon-
strated that the continents and the great mountain
ranges are buoyed up and as it were are floating
somewhat like slags on the internal magma the
mean density of the crust is less under the land
and the mountains than under the old seabeds this
is especially true of the himalayan region

   that uplift is probably the most recent of all
and it is there where at present the highest land
of the globe exists that i expect that the new up-
heaval will be most strongly manifested it is for
that reason and not merely because it is now the
highest part of the earth that i am going with the
ark to asia

   but said professor jeremiah moses the up-
heaval of which you speak may produce a complete
revolution in the surface of the earth and if new
lands are upthrust they may appear at unexpected
points

  not at all returned cosmo the tectonic
features of the globe were fixed at the beginning

as asia has hitherto been the highest and the great-
est mass of land it will continue to be so in
the future it is there believe me that we shall
replant the seed of humanity

  do you not think asked professor alexander
jones that there will be a tremendous outburst
of volcanic energy if such upheavals occur and
may not that render the reemerging lands unin-
habitable

  no doubt cosmo replied every form of
plutonic energy will be immensely reenforced you
remember the recent outburst of all the volcanoes
when the sea burst over the borders of the con-
tinents but these forces will be mainly expended
in an effort of uplifting unquestionably there will
be great volcanic spasms but they will not pre-
vent the occupation of the broadening areas of land
which will not be thus affected

  upon these lands exclaimed sir wilfred athel-
stone in a loud voice i will develop life from the
barren minerals of the crust the age of chemical
parthenogenesis will then have dawned upon the
earth and man will have become a creator

  will the sir englishman give me room for a
word cried costaks theriade raising his tall
form on his toes and agitating his arms in the air
he will create not anything it is  that will un-
loose the energies of the atoms of matter and make
of the new man a new god

  cosmo versl quieted the incipient outbreak of
his jealous speculative geniuses and the discus-
sion of his theory was continued for some time at
length de beauxchamps shrugging his shoulders
exclaimed with a return of his habitual gaiety
tres bien vive the world of cosmo versdl
i salute the new eve that is to come

chapter xx

the adventures in colorado

when professor pludder the president and
their companions on the aeroraft saw the
three men on the bluff motioning and
shouting to them they immediately sought the
means of bringing their craft to land this did
not prove to be exceedingly difficult for there was a
convenient rock with deep water around it on which
they could disembark

  the men ran down to meet them and to help them
ashore exhibiting the utmost astonishment at see-
ing them there

  whar in creation did you come from exclaimed
one giving the professor a pull up the bank meb-
be youre cosmo versdl and thats yer ark

    im professor pludder and this is the presi-
dent of the united states

  the president of the un- see here stranger
ill take considerable from you considering the fix
yer in but you dont want to go too fur

  its true asseverated the professor this
gentleman is the president and weve escaped from
washington please help the ladies

  ill help the ladies all right but im blamed
if i believe yer yarn howd you git here you
couldnt hev floated across the continent on that
thing
the second deluge



  we came on the raft that you see interrupted
mr samson we left the appalachian mountains
two weeks ago

  well by-it must be true muttered the man
they couldnt hev come from anywhar else in
that direction i reckon the hull blamed continent
is under water

  so it is said professor pludder and we made
for colorado knowing that it was the only land left
above the flood

  all finally got upon the bluff rejoiced to feel solid
ground once more beneath their feet but it was a
desolate prospect that they saw before them the
face of the land had been scoured and gullied by the
pouring waters the vegetation had been stripped
off except where in hollows it had been covered
with new-formed lakes some of which had drained
off after the downpour ceased the water finding its
way into the enveloping sea

  they asked the three men what had become of the
other inhabitants and whether there was any
shelter at hand

  weve ben wiped out said the original spokes-
man cosmo versal has done a pretty clean job
with his flood theres a kind of a cover that we
three hev built a ways back yonder out o timber
o one kind and another that was lodged about but
it wouldnt amount to much if there was another
cloudburst it wouldnt stand a minute its good
to sleep in

  are you the only survivors in this region
asked the president

  i reckon you see all thets left of us the aint
one out o a hundred thats left alive in these
parts

  what became of them

swept off replied the man with anexpressive
gesture-and drownded right out under the sky
and how did you and your company escape
by gitting up amongst some rocks that was
highern the average

  how did you manage to live-what did you have
to eat

  we didnt eat much-we didnt hev much time
to think o eatin we had one hoss with us and
he served when his time come after the sky
cleared we skirmished about and dug up something
that we could manage to eat lodged in gullies where
the water had washed together what had been in
houses and cellars weve got a gun and a little
ammunition and once in a while we could kill an
animal that had contrived to escape somehow
and you think that there are no other human
beings left alive anywhere around here

  i know th aint thes probably some up in the
foot-hills and around the pike they had a better
chance to git among rocks we hed jest made up
our minds to go hunting for em when we ketched
sight o you and then we concluded to stay and
see who you was

  im surprised that you didnt go sooner

  we couldnt there was a roarin torrent com-
ing down from the mountains that cut us off its
only last night that it stopped

  well its evident that we cannot stay here
said professor pludder we must go with these

men toward the mountains let ua take whats
left of the compressed provisions out of the raft
and then well eat a good meal and be off

  the three men were invited to share the repast
and they ate with an appetite that would have
amused their hosts if they had not been so anxious
to reserve as much as possible of their provisions
for future necessities

  the meal finished they started off their new
friends aiding to carry provisions and what little
extra clothing there was the aspect of the country
they traversed affrighted them here and there
were partially demolished houses or farm struc-
tures or cellars choked with debris of what had
once been houses

  farm implements and machinery were scattered
about and half buried in the torrent-furrowed land
in the wreck of one considerable village through
which they passed they found a stone church and
several stone houses of considerable pretentions
standing almost intact as to walls but with roofs
doors and windows smashed and torn off

  it was evident that this place which lay in a
depression of the land had been buried by the
rushing water as high as the top stories of the
buildings from some of the sights that they saw
they shrank away and afterward tried to forget
them

  owing to the presence of the women and chil-
dren their progress was slower than it might other-
wise have been they had great difficulty in cross-
ing the course of the torrent which their compan-
ions had described as cutting them off from the
foot-hills of the pikes peak range

  the water had washed out a veritable canon a
hundred or more feet deep in places and with rag-
ged precipitous walls and banks which they had to
descend on one side and ascend on the other here
the skill and local knowledge of their three new-
found friends stood them in good stead there was
yet enough water in the bottom of the great gully to
compel them to wade carrying the women and
children

   but just before nightfall they succeeded in reach-
ing a range of rocky heights where they deter-
mined to pass the night they managed to make a
fire with brush that had been swept down the moun-
tain flanks and had remained wedged in the rocks
and thus they dried their soaked garments and
were able to do some cooking and to have a blaze
to give them a little heat during the night for
the air turned cold after the disappearance of the
sun

  when the others had sunk into an uneasy slum-
ber the president and professor pludder sat long
replenishing the fire and talking of their future
course

  i think said the professor that we shall find
a considerable population alive among the moun-
tains there is nothing in colorado below four
thousand feet elevation and not much below five
thousand the great inner parks were probably
turned into lakes but they will drain off as the
land around us here has done already

  those who managed to find places of comparative
shelter will now descend into the level lands and


amazing stories

try to hunt up the site of their homes if only
some plants and grain have been preserved they can
after a fashion begin to cultivate the soil

  but there is no soil said the president shud-
dering at the recollection of the devastation he had
witnessed it has all been washed off

  no replied the professor theres yet a good
deal in the low places where the water rested
but it is now the middle of winter

  reckoned by the almanac it is but you see that
the temperature is that of summer and has been
such for months i think that this is due in some
way to the influence of the nebula although i can-
not account for it at any rate it will be possible
to plant and sow

  the whole body of the atmosphere having been
raised four thousand feet the atmospheric condi-
tions here now are virtually the same as at the for-
mer sea-level if we can find the people and re-
assure them we must take the lead in restoring the
land to fertility and also in the reconstruction of
homes

  suppose the flood should recommence
  there is no likelihood of it

  then said the president putting his face be-
tween his hands and gazing sadly into the fire
here is all that remains of the mightiest nation
of the world the richest the most populous-and
we are to build up out of this remnant a new
fatherland

  this is not the only remnant said professor
pludder one-quarter at least of the area of the
united states is still above sea-level think of
arizona new mexico utah nevada the larger
part of california wyoming a part of montana
two-thirds of idaho a half of oregon and washing-
ton-all above the critical level of four thousand
feet and all except the steepest mountain-sides can
be reclaimed

  there is hope for our country yet remem-
ber that the climate of this entire region will now
be changed since the barometric isobars have been
lifted up and the line of thirty inches pressure
now meets the edge of the colorado plateau there
may be a corresponding change in the rainfall and
in all the conditions of culture and fertility

  yes sighed the president but i cannot i can-
not withdraw my mind from the thought of the
millions millions millions who have perished

  i do not say that we should forget them re-
plied professor pludder heaven forbid but i
do say that we must give our attention to those that
remain and turn our faces steadily toward the
future

  abiel returned the president pressing the
professors hand you are right my confidence in
you was shaken but now i follow you again
thus they talked until midnight and then got
a little rest with the others they were up and off
at break of day and as they mounted higher they
began to encounter immense rocks that had come
tumbling down from above

  how can you talk of people escaping toward the
mountains if they had to encounter these de-
manded the president

  some of these rocks have undoubtedly been

brought down by the torrents professor pludder
replied but i believe that the greater number fell
earlier during the earthquakes that accompanied
the first invasions of the sea

  but those earthquakes may have continued all
through

  i do not think so we have felt no trembling
of the earth i believe that the convulsions lasted
only for a brief period while the rocks were yield-
ing to the pressure along the old sea-coast after
a little the crust below adjusted itself to the new
conditions and even if the rocks fell while people
were trying to escape from the flood below they
must like the water have followed the gorges and
hollow places while the fugitives would of course
keep upon the ridges

  whatever perils they may have encountered peo-
ple had certainly escaped as the professor had
averred when the party in the middle of the day
were seated at their lunch on an elevated point
from which they could see far over the strange
ocean that they had left behind them while the
southern buttresses of pikes peak rose steeply to-
ward the north they discovered the first evidence of
the existence of refugees in the mountains this
was a smoke rising over an intervening ridge
which their new companions declared could be due
to nothing less than a large camp-fire

  they hastened to finish their meal and then
climbed the ridge as soon as they reached it they
found themselves looking down into a broad shallow
canon where there were nearly twenty rudely con-
structed cabins with a huge fire blazing in the
midst of the place and half a dozen red-shirted men
busy about it evidently occupied in the preparation
of the dinner of a large party

  their friends recognized an acquaintance in one
of the men below and hailed him with delight in-
stantly men women and children came running out
of the huts to look at them and as they descended
into this improvised village they were received
with a hospitality that was almost hilarious

  the refugees consisted of persons who had
escaped from the lower lands in the immediate
vicinity and they were struck dumb when told that
they were entertaining the president of the united
states and his family

  the entire history of their adventures was re-
lated on both sides the refugees told how at the
commencement of the great rain when it became
evident that the water would inundate their farms
and buildings they loaded themselves with as many
provisions as they could carry and in spite of the
suffocating downpour that filled the air managed
to fight their way to the ridge overhanging the
deep cut in which they were now encamped

  hardly a quarter of those who started arrived
in safety they sheltered themselves to the number
of about thirty in a huge cavern which faced down
the mountain and had a slightly upward sloping
floor so that the water did not enter here by
careful economy they were able to eke out their
provisions until the sky cleared after which the
men being used to outdoor labor and hunting
contrived to supply the wants of the forlorn little
community
the second deluge



    they managed to kill a few animals and found
  the bodies of others recently killed or drowned
  later they descended into the lowlands as the water
  ran off and searching among the ruins of their
  houses found some remnants of supplies in the cel-
  lars and about the foundations of the barns they
  were preparing to go down in a body and seek to
  reestablish themselves on the sites of their old
  homes when the presidents party came upon them

    the meeting with these refugees was but the first
  of a series of similar encounters on the way along
  the eastern face of the pikes peak range in the
  aggregate they met several hundred survivors who
  had established themselves on the site of colorado
  springs where a large number of houses standing
  on the higher ground had escaped

    they had been soaked with water descending
  through the shattered roofs and broken windows
  and pouring into the basements and cellars the
  fugitives came from all directions some from the
  caverns on the mountains and some from the rocks
  toward the north and east a considerable number
  asserted that they had found refuge in the garden
  of the gods

    as near as could be estimated about a quarter
  of the population remained alive the strong points
  of professor pludder now once more came out
  conspicuously he proved himself an admirable
  organizer he explored all the country round and
  enheartened everybody setting them to work to
  repair the damage as much as possible

 some horses and cattle were found whichtfollow-
  ing their instincts had managed to escape the flood
  in the houses and other buildings yet standing a
  great deal of food and other supplies was dis-
  covered so that there was no danger of a famine
  as he had anticipated the soil had not all been
  washed away from the flat land and he advised the
  inhabitants to plant quick-growing seeds at once

     he utilized the horses to send couriers in all direc-
  tions some going even as far as denver every-
  where virtually the same conditions were found-
  many had escaped and were alive only needing the
  guidance of a quicker intelligence and this was sup-
  plied by the advice which the professor instructed
  his envoys to spread among the people he sought
  to cheer them still more by the information that the
  president was among them and looking out for
  their welfare

    one thing which his couriers at last began to
  report to him was a cause of surprise they said
  that the level of the water was rapidly falling
  some who had gone far toward the east declared
  that it had gone down hundreds of feet but the
  professor reflected that this was impossible because
  evaporation could not account for it and he could
  not persuade himself that so much water could have
  found its way into the interior of the crust

    he concluded that his informants had allowed
  their hopes to affect their eyesight and strong as
  usual in his professional dogmas he made no per-
  sonal examination besides professor pludder
  was beginning to be shaken in his first belief that
  all trouble from the nebula was at an end once
  having been forced to accept the hypothesis that a

watery nebula had met the earth lie began to reflect
that they might not be through with it

  in any event he deemed it wise to prepare for it
if it should come back accordingly he advised that
the population that remained should concentrate in
the stronger houses built of stone and that every
effort should be made to strengthen them further
and to make the roofs as solid as possible he also
directed that no houses should be occupied that were
not situated on high ground surrounded with slopes
that would give ready flow to the water in case the
deluging rain should recommence

  he had no fixed conviction that it would recom-
mence but he was uneasy owing to his reflections
and wished to be on the safe side he sent similar
instructions as far as his horsemen could reach

  the wisdom of his doubts became manifest about
two weeks after the arrival of the presidents party
without warning the sky which had been perfectly
blue and cloudless for a month turned a sickly yel-
low then mists hid the head and in a little while
the entire outline of pikes peak and after that a
heavy rain began

  terror instantly seized the people and at first
nobody ventured out of doors but as time went on
and the rain did not assume the proportions of the
former debacle although it was very heavy and con-
tinuous hope revived everybody was on the watch
for a sudden clearing up

  instead of clearing however the rain became
very irregular gushing at time in torrents which
were even worse than the original downpour but
these tremendous gushes were of brief duration so
that the water had an opportunity to run off the
higher ground before the next downpour occurred

  this went on for a week and then the people
were terrified at finding that water was pouring up
through all the depressions of the land cutting off
the highlands from pikes peak with an arm of the
sea it was evident that the flood had been rapidly
rising and if it should rise but little higher they
would be caught in a trap the inland sea it was
clear had now invaded the whole of colorado to the
feet of the mountains and was creeping up on them

  just at this time a series of earthquakes began
they were not severe but were continuous the
ground cracked open in places and some houses
were overturned but there were no wall-shattering
shocks-only a continual and dreadful trembling
accompanied by awful subterranean sounds

  this terrible state of affairs had lasted for a day
before a remarkable discovery was made which
filled many hearts with joy although it seemed to
puzzle professor pludder as much as it rejoiced him

  the new advance of the sea was arrested there
could be no question of that for too many had
anxiously noted the points to which the water had
attained

  we have said that professor pludder was puz-
zled he was seeking in his mind a connection
between the seismic tremors and the cessation of
the advance of the sea inasmuch as the downpour
continued the flood ought still to rise

  he rejected as soon as it occurred to him the idea
that the earth could be drinking up the waters as
fast as they fell and the idea that the trembling

was an accompaniment of this gigantic deglutition

  sitting in a room with the president and other
members of the party from washington he re-
mained buried in his thoughts answering inquiries
only in monosyllables presently he opened his eyes
very wide and a long-drawn a-ah came from his
mouth then he sprang to his feet and cried out
but only as if uttering a thought aloud to himself

chapter xxi

the father of horror

at the time when the president of the united
states and his companions were beginning
to discover the refugees around pikes peak
cosmo versals ark accompanied by the jules
verne whose commander had decided to remain in
touch with his friends was crossing the submerged
hills and valleys of languedoc under a sun as bril-
liant as that which had once made them a land of
gold de beauxchamps remained aboard the ark
much of the time

  cosmo liked to have him with himself and cap-
tain arms on the bridge because there they could
talk freely about their plans and prospects and the
frenchman was a most entertaining companion

  meanwhile the passengers in the saloons and on
the promenade decks formed little knots and coteries
for conversation for reading and for mutual diver-
sion or strolled about from side to side watching
the endless expanse of waters for the occasional ap-
pearance of some inhabitant of the deep that had
wandered over the new oceans bottom

  these seemed to be coming to the surface to get
bearings every such incident reminded them of
what lay beneath the waves and led them to think
and talk of the awful fate that had overwhelmed
their fellow men until the spirits of the most care-
less were subdued by the pervading melancholy

  king richard strangely enough had taken a lik-
ing for amos blank who was frequently asked to
join the small and somewhat exclusive circle of
compatriots that continually surrounded the fallen
monarch the billionaire and the king often leaned
elbow to elbow over the rail and put their heads
companionably together while pointing out some ob-
ject on the sea lord swansdown felt painfully cut
by this but of course he could offer no objection

  finally cosmo invited the king to come upon the
bridge from which passengers were generally ex-
cluded and the king insisted that blank should go
too cosmo consented for blank seemed to him to
have become quite a changed man and was some-
times full of practical suggestions

  so it happened that when captain arms an-
nounced that the ark was passing over the ancient
city of carcassonne cosmo the king de beaux-
champs amos blank and the captain were all to-
gether on the bridge when captain arms men-
tioned their location king richard became very
thoughtful after musing for a time he said

  ah how all these names toulouse carcassonne
languedoc bring back to me the memory of my
namesake of olden times richard i of england
this over which we are floating was the land of the

troubadours and richard was the very prince of
troubadours with all his faults england never
had a king like him

  knowing your devotion to peace which was the
reason why i wished you to be of the original com-
pany in the ark i am surprised to hear you say
that said cosmo

  ah but cceur de lion was a true englishman
even in his love of fighting what would he say if
he knew where england lies to-day what would
he say if he knew the awful fate that had come upon
this fair and pleasant land from whose poets and
singers he learned the art of minstrelsy

he would say do not despair  returned cos-
mo  show the courage of an englishman and
fight for your race if you cannot for your country 
but may not england may not all these lands
emerge again from the floods asked the king

  not in our time not in our childrens time re-
plied cosmo versal thoughtfully shaking his head
in the remote future yes-but i cannot tell how
remote tibet was once an appanage of your crown
before china taught the west what war meant and
in tibet you may help to found a new empire but
i must tell you that it will not resemble the empires
of the past democracy will be its corner-stone
and science its law

  then i devote myself to democracy and science
responded king richard

  good admirable exclaimed amos blank and
de beauxchamps simultaneously while captain
arms seemed on the point of patting the king on the
back but hi attention together with that of the
others was distracted by a huge whale blowing al-
most directly in the course of the ark

  blessed if i ever expected to see a sight like
that in these parts exclaimed the captain this
lifting the ocean up into the sky is upsetting the
order of nature id as soon expect to sight a
cachalot on top of the rocky mountains

  theyll be there too before long said cosmo
i wonder what hes looking for continued cap-
tain arms he must have come down from the
north he couldnt have got in through the
pyrenees or the sierra nevadas hes just navi-
gated right over the whole country straight down
from the channel

  the whale sounded at the approach of the ark
but in a little while he was blowing again off to-
ward the south and then the passengers caught
sight of him and there was great excitement

  he seemed to be of enormous size and he sent
his fountain to an extraordinary height in the air
on he went appearing and disappearing steering
direct for africa until only with glasses could
they see his white plume blowing on the horizon

  not even the reflection that they themselves were
sailing over europe impressed some of the pas-
sengers with so vivid a sense of their situation as
the sight of this monstrous inhabitant of the ocean
taking a view of his new domain

  at night cosmo continued the concerts and the
presentation of the shakespearian dramas and for
an hour each afternoon he had a conference in
the saloon at which theriade and sir athelatone
were almost the sole performers
the second deluge



  their disputes and cosmos efforts to keep the
peace amused for a while but at length the audi-
ences diminished until cosmo himself with his con-
stant companions the frenchman the king amos
blank the three professors from washington and
a few other savants were the only listeners

  but the music and the plays always drew im-
mensely joseph smith was kept busy most of tho
time in cosmos cabin copying plans for the re-
generation of mankind

  when they knew that they had passed over the
borders of france and were sailing above the
mediterranean sea it became necessary to lay their
course with considerable care cosmo decided that
the only safe plan would be to run south of sardinia
and then keep along between sicily and tunis and
so on toward lower egypt

  there he intended to seek a way over the moun-
tains north of the sinai peninsula into the syrian
desert from which he could reach the ancient valley
of the euphrates and the persian gulf he would
then pass down the arabian sea swing round india
and ceylon and by way of the bay of bengal and
the plains of the ganges and brahmaputra ap-
proach the himalayas

  captain arms was rather inclined to follow the
gulf of suez and the depression of the red sea
but cosmo was afraid that they would have dif-
ficulty in getting the ark safely through between
the mt sinai peaks and the jebel gharib range

  well youre the commodore said the captain
at the end of the discussion but hang me if id
not rather follow a sea where i know the courses
than go navigating over mountains and deserts in
the land of shinar well land on top of jerusalem
yet youll see

  feeling sure of plenty of water under keel they
now made better speed and de beauxchamps retired
into the jules verne and detached it from the ark
finding that he could distance the latter easily with
the submersible running just beneath the surface
of the water

  come up to blow and take a look around from
the bridge once in a while the captain called out
to him as he disappeared and the cover closed over
him the jules verne immediately sank out of
sight

  they passed round sardinia and between the
old african coast and sicily and were approaching
the malta channelwhen their attention was drawn
to vast smoke far off toward the north

  its etna in eruption said cosmo to the cap-
tain

  a magnificent sight exclaimed king richard
who happened to be on the bridge

  yes and id like to see it nearer remarked
cosmo as a wonderful column of smoke as black
as ink seemed to shoot up to the very zenith

  youd better keep away captain arms said
warningly theres no good comes of fooling round
volcanoes in a ship

  oh its safe enough returned cosmo we can
run right over the southeastern corner of sicily and
get as near as we like there is nothing higher
than about three thousand feet in that part of the
island so well have a thousand feet to spare

  but maybe the water has lowered somewhat

  not more than a foot or two said cosmo go
ahead

  the captain plainly didnt fancy the adventure
but he obeyed orders and the arks nose was turned
northward to the delight of many of the passengers
who had become greatly interested when they
learned that the tremendous smoke that they saw
came from mount etna some of them were
nervous

  the more adventurous spirits heartily applauded
cosmo versals design to give them a closer view of
so extraordinary a spectacle even from their pre-
sent distance the sight was one that might have
filled them all with terror if they had not already
been through adventures which had hardened their
nerves the smoke was truly terrific in appearance

  it did not spread low over the sea but rose
in an almost vertical column widening out at a
height of several miles until it seemed to canopy
the whole sky toward the north

  it could be seen spinning in immense rolling
masses the outer part of which were turned by the
sunshine to a dingy brown color while the main
stem of the column rising directly from the great
crater was of pitchy blackness

  an awful roaring was audible sending a shiver
through the ark at the bottom of the mass of
smoke through which gleams of fire were seen to
shoot as they drew nearer appeared the huge coni-
cal form of the mountain whose dark bulk still rose
nearly seven thousand feet above the sea that cov-
ered the great beautiful and historic island be-
neath it

  they had got within about twenty miles of the
base of the mountain when a shout was heard by
those on the bridge and cosmo and the captain
looking for its source saw the jules verne risen to
the surface a little to starboard and de beaux-
champs excitedly signaling to them they just
made out the words sheer off when the ark
with a groaning sound took ground and they were
almost precipitated over the rail of the bridge

  aground again by-i exclaimed captain arms
instantly signaling all astern i told you not to go
fooling round a volcano

  this beats me cried cosmo versal i wonder
if the island has begun to rise

  more likely the sea has begun to fall growled
captain arms

  do you know where we are asked cosmo

  we cant be anywhere but on the top of monte
lauro replied the captain

  but thats only three thousand feet high

  its exactly three thousand two hundred and
thirty feet said the captain i havent navigated
the old mediterranean a hundred times for noth-
ing

  but even then we should have near seven hun-
dred and fifty feet to spare allowing for the draft
of the ark and a slight subsidence of the water

  well you havent allowed enough thats plain
said the captain

  but its impossible that the flood can have sub-
sided more than seven hundred feet already

  i dont care how impossible it is-here we are


amazing stories

were stack on a mountain-top and if we dont
leave our bones on it im a porpoise

  by this time the jules verne was alongside and
de beauxchamps shouted up

  i was running twenty feet under water keeping
along with the ark when my light suddenly re-
vealed the mountain ahead i hurried up and tried
to warn you but it was too late

  cant you go down and see where were fast
asked cosmo

  certainly thats just what i was about to pro-
pose replied the frenchman and immediately the
submersible disappeared

  after a long time during which cosmo succeeded
in allaying the fears of his passengers the sub-
mersible reappeared and de beauxchamps made his
report he said that the ark was fast near the
bow on a bed of shelly limestone

  he thought that by using the utmost force of the
jules verne whose engines were very powerful
in pushing the ark combined with the backing of
her own engines she might be got off

  hurry up then and get to work cried cap-
tain arms this flood is on the ebb and a few
hours more will find us stuck here like a ray with
his saw in a whales back

  de beauxchampss plan was immediately adopted
the jules verne descended and pushed with all her
force while the engines of the ark were reversed
and within fifteen minutes they were once more
afloat

  without waiting for a suggestion from cosmo
versal the frenchman carefully inspected with his
search-light the bottom of the ark where she had
struck and when he came to the surface he was
able to report that no serious damage had resulted

  theres no hole he said only a slight denting
of one of the plates which will not amount to any-
thing

  cosmo however was not content until he had
made a careful inspection by opening some of the
manholes in the inner skin of the vessel he found
no cause for anxiety and in an hour the ark re-
sumed its voyage eastward passing over the site of
ancient syracuse

  by this time a change of the wind had sent the
smoke from etna in their direction and now it
lay thick upon the water and rendered it for a
while impossible to see twenty fathoms from the
bridge

  its old etnas dying salute said cosmo he
wont have his head above water much longer
but the flood is going down exclaimed captain
arms

  yes and that puzzles me there must have been
an enormous absorption of water into the interior
far greater than i ever imagined possible but wait
until the nucleus of the nebula strikes us in the
mean time this lowering of the water renders it
necessary for us to make haste or we may not get
over the mountains round suez before the down-
pour recommences

  as soon as they escaped from the smoke of etna
they ran full speed ahead again and keeping well
south of crete at length one morning they found

themselves in the latitude and longitude of alex-
andria

  the weather was still superb and cosmo was
very desirous of getting a line on the present height
of the water he thought that he could make a
fair estimate of this from the known height of the
mountains about sinai accordingly they steered
in that direction and on the way passed directly
over the site of cairo

  then the thought of the pyramids came to them
all and de beauxchamps who had come aboard the
ark and who was always moved by sentimental
considerations proposed that they should spend a
few hours here while he descended to inspect the
condition in which the flood had left those mighty
monuments

  cosmo not only consented to this but he even
offered to be a member of the party the french-
man was only too glad to have his company cos-
mo versal descended into the submersible after
instructing captain arms to hover in the neighbor-
hood

  the passengers and crew of the ark with ex-
pressions of anxiety that would have pleased their
subject if he had heard them watched the jules
verne disappear into the depths beneath

  the submersible was gone so long that the
anxiety of those aboard the ark deepened into
alarm and finally became almost panic they had
never before known how much they depended upon
cosmo versal

  he was their only reliance their only hope he
alone had known how to keep up their spirits and
when he had assured them as he so often did that
the flooding would surely recommence they had
hardly been terrified because of their unexpressed
confidence that let come what would his great
brain would find a way out for them

  now he was gone down into the depths of this
awful sea where their imaginations pictured a
thousand unheard of perils and perhaps they would
never see him again without him they knew
themselves to be helpless even captain arms
almost lost his nerve

  the strong good sense of amos blank alone saved
them from the utter despair that began to seize
them as hour after hour passed without the reap-
pearance of the jules verne

  his experience had taught him how to keep a
level head in an emergency and how to control
panics with king richard always at his side he
went about among the passengers and fairly laughed
them out of their fears

  without discussing the matter at all he convinced
them by simple force of his own apparent confi-
dence that they were worrying themselves about
nothing

  he was in fact as much alarmed as any of the
others but he never showed it he started a rumor
after six hours had elapsed that cosmo himself
had said that they would probably require ten or
twelve hours for their exploration

  cosmo had said nothing of the kind but blanks
prevarication had its intended effect and for-
tunately before the lapse of another six hours there
was news from under the sea
the second deluge



  and what was happening in the mysterious
depths below the ark what had so long detained
the submersible

  the point where the descent was made had been
so well chosen that the jules verne almost struck
the apex of the great pyramid as it approached the
bottom the water was somewhat muddy from the
sands of the desert and the search-light streamed
through a yellowish medium recalling the golden
atmosphere for which egypt had been celebrated
but nevertheless the light was so powerful that
they could see distinctly at a distance of several
rods

  the pyramid appeared to have been but little in-
jured although the tremendous tidal wave that had
swept up the nile during the invasion of the sea be-
fore the downpour began had scooped out the sand
down to the bed-rock on all sides

  finding nothing of particular interest in a cir-
cuit of the pyramid they turned in the direction
of the great sphinx

  this too had been excavated to its base and it
now stood up to its full height and a terrible ex-
pression seemed to have come into its enigmatic
features

  cosmo wished to get a close look at it and they
ran the submersible into actual contact with the
forepart of the gigantic statue just under the
mighty chin

  while they paused there gazing out of the front
window of the vessel a bursting sound was heard
followed by a loud crash and the jules verne was
shaken from stem to stern every man of them
threw himself against the sides of the vessel for
the sound came from overhead and they had an in-
stinctive notion that the roof was being crushed
down upon them

  a second resounding crash was heard shaking
them like an earthquake and the little vessel rolled
partly over upon its side

  we are lost cried de beauxchamps the
sphinx is falling upon us we shall be buried alive
here	

  a third crash came over their heads and the sub-
mersible seemed to sink beneath them as if seeking
to avoid the fearful blows that were rained upon its
roof

  still the stout curved ceiling strongly braced
within did not yield although they saw with
affright that it was bulged inward and some of the
braces were torn from their places but no water
came in

  stunned by the suddenness of the accident for a
few moments they did nothing but cling to such sup-
ports as were within their reach expecting that
another blow would either force the vessel com-
pletely over or break the roof in

  but complete silence now reigned and the mis-
siles from above ceased to strike the submersible
the search-light continued to beam out of the fore
end of the vessel and following its broad ray with
their eyes they uttered one cry of mingled amaze-
ment and fear and then stared without a word at
such a spectacle as the wildest imagination could
not have pictured

  the front of the sphinx had disappeared and the

light penetrating beyond the place where it had
stood streamed upon the face and breast of an
enormous black figure seated on a kind of throne
and staring into their faces with flaming eyes which
at once fascinated and terrified them

  to their startled imaginations the eyes seemed
to roll in their sockets and flashes of fire to dart
from them their expression was menacing and
terrifying beyond belief at the same time the as-
pect of the face was so majestic that they cowered
before it

  the cheek bones were high and massive and
polished until they shone in the light the nose and
chin were powerful in their contours and the brow
wore an intimidating frown it seemed to the awed
onlookers as if they had sacrilegiously burst into
the sanctuary of an offended god

  but after a minute or two of stupefaction they
thought again of the desperateness of their situa-
tion and turned from staring at the strange idol to
consider what they should do

  the fact that no water was finding its way into
the submersible somewhat reassured them but the
question now arose whether it could be withdrawn
from its position

  they had no doubt that the front of the sphinx
saturated by the water after the thousands of years
that it had stood there exposed to the desiccating
influences of the sun and the desert sands had sud-
denly disintegrated and fallen upon them pinning
their vessel fast under the fragments of its huge
chin

  de beauxchamps tried the engines and found that
they had no effect in moving the jvles verne he
tried again and again to disengage the vessel by
reversing but it would not stir then they debated
the only other means of escape

  although i have levium life-suits said the
frenchman and although the top can probably be
opened for the door seems not to have been touched
yet the instant it is removed the water will rush in
and it will be impossible to pump out the vessel

  are your life-suits so arranged that they will
permit of moving the limbs demanded cosmo

  certainly they are

  and can they be weighted so as to remain at the
bottom

  they are arranged for that responded de
beauxchamps

  and can the weights be detached from within
by the inmates without permitting the entrance of
water

  it can be done although a very little water
might enter during the operation

  then said cosmo let us put on the suits
open the door take out the ballast so that if re-
leased the submersible will rise to the surface
through its own buoyancy and then see if we can-
not loosen the vessel from outside

  it was a suggestion whose boldness made even the
owner and constructor of the jules verne stare for
a moment but evidently it was the only possible
way in which the vessel might be saved and know-
ing that in case of failure they could themselves
float to the surface after removing the weights from
the bottom of the suits they unanimously decided


amazing stories

to try cosmo versals plan it was terribly hard
work getting the ballast out of the submersible
working as they had to do under water which
rushed in as soon as the door was opened and in
their awkward suits which were provided with
apparatus for renewing the supply of oxygen but
at last they succeeded

  then they clambered outside and labored des-
perately to release the vessel from the huge frag-
ments of stone that pinned it down finally ex-
hausted by their efforts and unable to make any
impression they gave up

  de beauxchamps approached cosmo and mo-
tioned to him that it was time to ascend to the sur-
face and leave the jules verne to her fate but
cosmo signaled back that he wished first to examine
more closely the strange statue that was gazing up-
on them in the still unextinguished beam of the
search-light with what they might now have re-
garded as a look of mockery

  the others accordingly waited while cosmo
versal greatly impeded by his extraordinary gar-
ment clambered up to the front of the figure there
he saw something which redoubled his amazement

  on the broad breast he saw a representation of a
world overwhelmed with a deluge and encircling it
was what he instantly concluded to be the picture of
a nebula underneath in ancient egyptian hiero-
glyphics with which cosmo was familiar was an
inscription in letters of gold which could only be
translated thus

           i come again-

             at the end of time

  great heavens he said to himself it is a
prophecy of the second deluge

  he continued to gaze amazed at the figure and
the inscription until de beauxchamps clambered to
his side and indicated to him that it was necessary
that they should ascend without further delay
showing him by signs that the air-renewing ap-
paratus would give out

  with a last lingering look at the figure cosmo
imitated the others by detaching the weights from
below his feet and a minute later they were all
shooting rapidly toward the surface of the sea de
beauxchamps as he afterward declared uttering a
prayer for the repose of the jules verne

  the imaginary time which amos blank had fixed
as the limit set by cosmo for the return from the
depths was nearly gone and he was beginning to
cast about for some other invention to quiet the
rising fears of the passengers when it came in a
visible form which made the eyes of captain arms
the first to catch sight of it start from their
sockets he rubbed them and looked again-but
there it was

  a huge head human in outline with bulging
glassy eyes popped suddenly out of the depths fol-
lowed by the upper part of a gigantic form which
was no less suggestive of a monstrous man and
which immediately began to wave its armsl

  before the captain could collect his senses an-
other shot to the surface and then another and an-
other until there were seven of them floating and
awkwardly gesticulating within a radius of a hun-
dred fathoms on the starboard side of the vessel

  the whole series of apparitions did not occupy
more than a quarter of a minute in making their
appearance

  by the time the last had sprung into sight cap-
tain arms had recovered his wits and he shouted
an order to lower a boat at the same time running
down from the bridge to superintend the operation
many of the crew and passengers had in the mean
time seen the strange objects and they were
thrown into a state of uncontrollable excitement

  its them shouted the captain over his
shoulder in response to a hundred inquiries all put
at once and forgetting his grammar in the excite-
ment theyve come up in diving-suits

  amos blank comprehended the situation at once
and while the captain was attending to getting out
the boat he explained matters to the crowd

  the submersible must be lost he said quietly
but the men have escaped so there is no great
harm done it does great credit to that frenchman
that he should have been prepared for such an
emergency those are levium suits and ive no
doubt that he has got hydrogen somewhere inside
to increase their buoyancy

  within a quarter of an hour all the seven had
been picked up by the boat and returned to the
ark the strange forms were lifted aboard with
tackle to save time and as the first one reached
the deck it staggered about on its big limb for
a moment

  then the metallic head opened and the features
of de beauxchamps were revealed within

  before anybody could assist him he had freed him-
self from the suit and immediately began to aid the
others in ten minutes they all stood safe and sound
before the astonished eyes of the spectators cosmo
had suffered the most from the confinement and he
sank upon a seat but de beauxchamps seemed to
be the most affected with downcast look he said
sadly shaking his head

  the poor jules vernel i shall never see her
again

  what has happened demanded captain arms

  it was the father of horror muttered cosmo
versal

  the father of horror-whats that

  why the great sphinx returned cosmo grad-
ually recovering his breath didnt you know that
that was what the arabs always called the sphinx

  it was that which fell upon the submersible-
split right open and dropped its great chin upon
us as we were sailing round it and pinned us fast
but the sight that we saw when the sphinx fell
apart tell them de beauxchamps

  the frenchman took up the narrative while with
breathless attention passengers and crew crowded
about to listen to his tale

  when wef got to the bottom he said we first
inspected the great pyramid going all round it
with our search-light it was in good condition al-
though the tide that had come up the nile with
the invasion of the sea had washed away the sands
to a great depth all about when we had completed
the circuit of the pyramid we saw the sphinx
which had been excavated by the water so that it
stood up to its full height
the second deluge



  we ran close around it and when we were un-
der the chin the whole thing saturated by the water
which no doubt caused an expansion within-you
know how many thousand years the gigantic idol
had been desiccated by the sun and the desert winds
-dropped apart

  the submersible was caught by the falling mass
and partly crushed we labored for hours and
hours to release the vessel but there was little that
we could do it almost broke my heart to think of
leaving the jules verne there but it had to be done

  at last we put on the levium floating-suits
opened the cover at the top and came to the surface
the last thing i saw was the search-light still burn-
ing and illuminating the most marvelous spectacle
that human eyes ever gazed upon

  oh what was it what was it demanded a
score of voices in chorus

  it is impossible to describe it it was the secret
of old egypt revealed at last-at the end of the
world 

  but what was it like

  like a glimpse into the remotest corridors of
time interposed cosmo versal with a curious look
in his eyes

  some of you may have heard that long ago holes
were driven through the sphinx in the hope of dis-
covering something hidden inside but they missed
the secret the old god kept it well until his form
fell apart we were pinned so close to it that we
could not help seeing it even in the excitement of
our situation

  it had always been supposed that the sphinx

was the symbol of something-it was and more
than a symbol the explorers away back in the
nineteenth century who thought that they had found
something mysterious in the great pyramid went
wide of the mark when they neglected the sphinx
but what did you see

  we saw the prophecy of the second deluge
said cosmo rising to his feet his piercing eyes
aflame in the heart of the huge mass approach-
able no doubt by some concealed passage in the
rock beneath known only to the priests stood a
gigantic idol carved out of black marble

  it had enormous eyes of some gem that blazed
in the electric beam from the search-light with
huge golden ears and beard and on its breast was
a representation of a drowning world with a great
nebula sweeping over it

  it might have been a history instead of a pro-
phecy suggested one of the listening savants
perhaps it only told what had once happened
no replied cosmo shaking his big head it
was a prophecy under it in ancient egyptian
hieroglyphics which i recognized was an inscrip-
tion which could only be translated by the words
i come again-at the end of time

  there was a quality in cosmo versals voice
which made the hearers shudder with horror

  yes he added it comes again the prophecy
was hidden but science had its means of revelation
too if the world would but have listened to its
voice even without the prophecy i have saved the
flower of mankind

concluded

that what burl said was true as they had already
known

  then while the pink-skinned men feasted on the
meat burl had provided for them he and saya went
toward the burrow he had made ready it was
not like the other burrows being set apart from
them and its entrance was bordered on either side
by mushrooms as black as night all about the
entrance the black mushrooms clustered a strange
species that grew large and scattered its spores
abroad and then of its own accord melted into an
inky liquid that flowed away sinking slowly into
the ground

  in a little hollow below the opening of the burrow
an inky pool had gathered which reflected the gray
clouds above and the shapes of the mushrooms that
overhung its edges

  burl and saya made their way toward the burrow
in silence a picturesque couple against the black
background of the sable mushrooms and the earth
made dark by the inky liquid both of their figures
were swathed in cloaks of unsmirched whiteness and
wondrous softness and bound to burls forehead

seemed cast from bronze and he was a proud figure
as he led saya past the black pool and to the door-
way of their home

  they sat there watching while the darkness
came on and the moths and fireflies emerged to
dance in the night and listened when the rain be-
gan its slow deliberate dripping from the heavy
clouds above presently a gentle rumbling began-
the accumulation of the rain from all the mountain-
side forming a torrent that would pour in a six-
hundred-foot drop to the river far below

   the sound of the rushing water grew louder and
was echoed back from the cliffs on the other side of
the valley the fireflies danced like fairy lights in
the chasm and all the creatures of the night winged
their way aloft to join in the ecstasy of life and
love

   and then when darkness was complete and only
the fitful gleams of the huge fireflies were reflected
from the still surface of the black pool beneath their
feet burl reached out his hand to saya sitting be-
side him in the darkness she yielded shyly and
her soft warm hand found his in the obscurity
and burl bent over and kissed her on the lips

the man who could vanish

by a hyatt verrill
concluded

him a ten dollar bill he grinned knowingly threw
in the gears and with loudly honking horn headed
uptown as i had directed

  hastily bandaging lemuels face with my hand-
kerchief to prevent any further complications aris-
ing over blood dripping on the taxi seat or floor
and half-supporting him for he was still dazed
and groggy and without his glasses was almost as
blind as a bat i fanned him with my hat

  presently he showed signs of recovering took
several deep breaths of relief and ruefully felt of
his various bumps contusions and bruises then
with a groan he remarked whew that fellow
packed an awful punch

  yes i agreed and obviously the fact that you
are invisible does not prevent you from getting
hurt

  nor from suffering mumbled my companion
im positive my jaw is fractured

  dont try to talk i said id take you to a
hospital or a doctors office but youd have to be
visible and youre in no fit shape to materialize in
public you look like a butchery

  by the time we reached my apartments lemuel
was near a collapse and was i knew suffering in-
tensely but he was still game and with but
little assistance walked up the steps and into my
rooms where he instantly dropped upon a couch

  now if youre able to and the confounded thing
isnt out of order get back to your normal state
i commanded him ill have my doctor here in a
moment but youve got to be visible first

  i was greatly worried for fear that lemuel
might faint or lose consciousness before he could
restore himself to visibility and i was so perturbed
and excited that it never occurred to me that even
if he remained invisible i could give the glasses to
the physician and thus enable him to attend to
my friends injuries however to my relief lemuel
fumbled with his mechanism and presently was
once more visible to unaided human eyes and not
an instant too soon he had exhausted his last
strength in operating the device which dropped to
the floor as consciousness left him

  fortunately my doctor lived less than a block
distant and still more fortunately he was in his
office within five minutes he was bending over dr
unsinn and being as all doctors should be a most
discreet man he forbore to make embarrassing in-
quiries as to the manner in which lemuel had re-
ceived the wounds

  to my intense relief he assured me that there was
no fracture and no injuries more serious than the
one deep gash and severe contusions

  lemuel regained consciousness as the doctor was

bandaging the wound but he made no attempt to
speak and for that matter his face was too swollen
and painful to permit him to utter an intelligible
word for the next twenty-four hours

  in the meantime we eagerly bought and read the
papers which were filled with accounts of the hart-
well building mystery and i could see by lemuels
expression even through his bandages that he was
immensely pleased at the attention his feat had
attracted there were also items regarding our
or rather lemuels other exploits a score of per-
sons had reported the incident of the fainting wo-
man the man in the subway station had related
his experience but not a word appeared in print
regarding the sudden vanishing of the car no
doubt the guard hesitated to mention or report the
matter fearing that his superiors might quite rea-
sonably feel that a guard subject to such hallucina-
tions was unfit for his position and in all prob-
ability the passengers who had been present and
who the chances were had spoken to the guard
after our departure were convinced that they had
been subjected to some optical illusion

  and of course there was no reference to the thief-
chase or lemuels injuries for the thief alone had
seen anything out of the ordinary

  and of course no one had suspected our connec-
tion with all the phenomena for which i was ex-
tremely thankful although it did not please lemuel
who declared somewhat peevishly that he had re-
ceived no credit for his astounding discovery

  credit i exclaimed if the police knew you
were at the bottom of these things youd very prob-
ably be in jail by now

  and i continued i hope this last experience
of yours has convinced you that i was right and
that your discovery is a menace if you take my
advice youll destroy every one of your formulae
and every confounded contraption that has to do
with the invention

  a wry grin twisted dr unsinns plastered and
bandaged face no he declared i shall destroy
nothing but i must admit that i have found my
discovery is not so beneficial to the individual or the
public at large as i had hoped it is i fear too
vast in its possibilities to be given to the world as
i had planned but i still am positive that it is a
most important discovery and if properly employed
will be of incalculable benefit to the world no in-
stead of destroying it as you suggest i shall
present it to our government on the understanding
that it shall remain a secret until needed to avert
some national calamity

  i breathed a sigh of deep relief in that case
i replied your invention is as good as destroyed

the man with the strange head

by dr miles j breuer
concluded

been in prison for two years just last -week he was
released-

  chief peter john smith interrupted

  ive been putting two and two together and i
can shed a little light on this problem three days
ago the day before i was called to watch anstruther
pacing his room we picked up this man poulos in
the alleyway between rudge  guenzels and miller
 paines he was unconscious and must have re-
ceived a terrible licking at somebodys hands his
face was almost unrecognizable several ribs and
several fingers on his right hand were broken he
clutched a pistol fitted with a silencer and we found
that two shots had been fired from it here he
is-

  a limp bandaged plastered man was pushed in
between two policemen he was sullen and apathe-
tic until he caught sight of anstruthers face from
which the chief had drawn a corner of the sheet
terror and joy seemed to mingle in his face and in
his voice he raised his bandaged hand with an
ineffectual gesture and started off on some greek
religious expression and then turned dazedly to us
speaking painfully through his swollen face

  glad he dead i try to kill him shoot him two
time no kill so close- indicating the dis-
tance of a foot from his chest then he lick me
he is not man he is devil i not kill him but i
glad he dead

  the chief hurried him out and came in with a
small dapper man with a black chin whisker he
apologized to the coroner

  this is not a frame-up i am just following
out a hunch that i got a few minutes ago while
stoner was talking this is mr fournier i found
his address in anstruthers room and dug him up
i think he will be more important to you doctors
than he will in a court tell em what you told
me

  while the little frenchman talked the under-
takers assistant jerked off the sheet the under-
takers work had had its effect in getting rid of the
frightful odor and in making anstruthers face
presentable the body however looked for all
the world as though it were alive plump powerful
pink in the chest over the heart were two bullet
holes not bloody but clean-cut and black the
frenchman turned to the body and worked on it
with a little screw-driver as he talked

  mr anstruther came to me ten years ago when
i was a poor mechanic he had heard of my auto-
matic chess-player and my famous animated show-
window models and he offered me time and money
to find him a mechanical relief for his infirmity i
was an assistant at a paris laboratory where they
had just learned to split radium and get a hundred
horse-power from a pinch of powder anstruther
was weak and thin but ambitious

  the frenchman lifted off two plates from the
chest and abdomen of the body and the flanks
swung outward as though on hinges he removed
a number of packages that seemed to fit carefully
within and which were on the ends of cables and
chains

  now- he said to the assistants who held the
feet he put his hands into the chest cavity and
as the assistants pulled the feet away he lifted
out of the shell a small wrinkled emaciated body
the body of an old man which now looked quite in
keeping with the well-known anstruther head
its chest was covered with dried blood and there
were two bullet holes over the heart the under-
takers assistants carried it away while we crowded
around to inspect the mechanism within the arms
and legs of the pink and live-looking shell headless
gaping at the chest and abdomen but uncannily like
a healthy powerful man

           the end

discussions

    in this department wc shall discuss every month topics of in-
terest to all of our rcadors the editors invite correspondence on alt
subjects directly or indirectly related to the stories appearing in this
magazine only letters of interest to all of our readers will be pub-

lished and discussed by the editors due to the great influx of mail it
is impossible to answer all letters personally and in case a special per-
sonal answer is required a nominal fee of c to cover time and post-
age is required

an irate correspondent recently wrote in
voicing his utter disapproval of the island
of dr moreau he said so much that we
can not reproduce the letter in full because
it would take up too much space but he took
us to task stating that the story was utterly
impossible that animals could never turn
into humans and humans certainly never
into animals he said many other uncom-
plimentary things about the story in general

  in answer we print a clipping which ap-
peared in the new york titties from an as-
sociated press dispatch as usual truth is
stranger than fiction

  two little wolf girls were found rcccntly
living in a wolfs den near an isolated village
in bengalbritish india the story is told
by the wcsi minster gazette which received
it from india vouched for by the rev jal
singh of midnapur bengal and bishop

dr moreau and the wolf girls

pakenhatti walsh of bishops college cal-
cutta

  bishop walsh relates that about the end of
august while visiting the rev jal singhs
orphanage at midnapur mr singh recounted
how he discovered the wolf girls

  in a distant part of his district not long
before the villagers pointed out to him a path
they avoided because it zuas haunted by de-
mons investigation revealed a wolf den in
which there were several wolf cubs and two
girls about two and eight years of age both
exceedingly fierce running on all fours utter-
ing guttural barks and living like wolves

  the supposition was that they were aban-
doned as babies by their mother or mothers
and were found and adopted by the she wolf
with much difficulty the children were
rescued but the younger died soon afterward

  the elder child survived and is nou at the
orphanage she was gradually weaned from

her savage ways but she fought fiercely
against wearing clothes and tore them off
even after they were sewn on her for a
time she refused to be washed and ate with
her mouth in a dish eventually she was
taught to use her hands and say a few words

  she still is weak mentally and neither cries
nor laughs but is gentle with animals pre-
ferring the company of dogs to children

  the above story seems to have excited some
discussion in london and several named cor-
respondents have written to the westminster
gazette citing the fact that these stories are
rather common in india and it seems that in
west africa stories are told of small children
being reared by some large species of monkey
in the jungle book rudyard kipling en-
larges on the association of a child with a band
of wolves and has produced some of his most
picturesque fiction in this work-editor

     a letter to cosmo versal
 we print below a letter which we have re-
 ceived the writer evidently thought that cosmo
 versal the fictitious hero of the fictitious story
 the second deluge was a real person and
 built his ark as described in the story funny as
 this is it certainly testifies to the skill of the
 writer in gving so real an aspect to the most ob-
 vious fiction-editor

 dear sir

    i am interested in your ark and wish you would
 send me a set of plans for a small ark which i
 would like to build to take care of my wife and
 seven children so please send them at once

                   j w f newport news va

 jules verne a promising writer
 we print below the first lines of a critical letter
 we received from one of our esteemed readers it
 should be remembered that jules verne died many
 years ago and on his tombstone at amiens france
 there is an impressive figure an illustration of
 which we reproduce on bur contents-page in the
 upper left-hand corner we put this next to the
 cosmo versal letter as both of them arc safely
 ensconced in the domain of classio hilarity

 some time ago i read one of your issues and
 was greatly surprised to find such reading matter
 as is published in your magazine mr jules
 vernes story was of the best i have ever read
 he is a very promising writer you also have
 several other good stories in tho october issue

criticism of the naval battle in
station x

 editor amazing stories

 have been a reader of amazing stories since
 the maiden issue seeing that you seek opinions
 i beg to state that first you seek prestige
 through the names of such old masters as jules
 verne who in his day was supreme as a
 deseriber of the bizarre but whose wildest
 flights of imagination presents things and condi-
 tions that are to-day merely commonplace if not
 slightly antique and ridiculous he can no longer
 amaze us most of us have read all that before
 anyway

  also many of your authors arc very amateurish
  in the use of words and short on facts as in the
  case of mr windsor in station x no cruiser
  in existence can make even the poorest showing
  iti the presence of a man-of-war the sea lion
  would have been hammered to pieces and sunk in
  less than five minutes of coming under the guns of
  battleship no  as she must have done in
  leaving the lagoon if your chart is correct

  if my criticism seems harsh forgive it on the
  grounds that i am interested in the welfare of
  amazing stories and hope to sec them truly
  great and not in the class of cheap fiction

                        prof jack e edwards
                        san francisco calif

  if you will read attentively the description of
  the sea-fight in the last lines of station x you
  will see that much more was involved than the
  simple battle between the cruiscr and the battle-
  ship and the martians strange weapons gave an
  aspect to the battle which removes it from criticism
  the great fleet was all but annihilated as it was
  besides this we have received numbers of very
  strong commendations of station x which has
  proved itself a very acceptable story to our readers
  -editor

an interesting suggestion

 editor amazing stories

   your magazine amazing storifs is the best i
 have read in years so i would like to see it come
 out semi-monthly at c per copy

    i would like to see the short stories continue
  and the long ones are all right split up in two
  or three parts but some people do not like this
  so the compromise i would offer is to publish a
  complete story in one issue and a bunch of short
  stones in the next

   if your stories continue as good as those you
 have published then your magazines succcss is
 assured

                               a b maloix
 silver creek wash
 you are one of several thousand readers who
 would like to see the magazine appear twice every
 month and we certainly anticipate carrying out
 the wish expressed by so many for we have a
 number of expressions of this desire your sug-
 gestion of one long story jn alternate issues and
 short stories in intermediate issues is to say
 the least ingenious and could be very well car-
 ried out in a bi-monthly-editor

earthing one of chemistrys
yet undiscovered secrets

 do you remember how the tales of pirate gold used to fire
 your imagination and make you want to sail the uncharted
 seas in search of treasure and adventure and then you
 would regret that such things were no longer done but that
 is a mistake they are done-today and everyday-not on
 desert islands but in the chemical laboratories throughout
 your own country quietly systematically the chemist works
 iiis work is difficult but more adventurous than the blood-
 curdling deeds of the spanish main instead of meeting an
 early and violent death on some forgotten shore he gathers
 wealth and honor through his invaluable contributions to hu-
 manity alfred nobel the swedish chemist who invented
 dynamite made so many millions that the income alone from
 his bequests provides five  prizes every year for the
  uaemen f science and peace c m hall the chemist
 who discovered how to manufacture aluminum made millions
 through this discovery f g cottrell who devised a valu-
 able process for recovering the waste from flue gases james
 gayley who showed how to save enormous losses in steel
 manufacture l h baekeland who invented bakclite-these
 are only a few of the men to whom fortunes have come
 through their chemical achievements

now is the time to
study chemistry

 e true story ofaman who
 won where others failed

a curious criticism

 editor am azin r stories

   i have always been an avid reader of pseudo-
 vscicntmc stories or as you term them scicnti-
 fiction-a very good discriptive word by the way
 -and i have waited for years for something like
 this to appear

   one gets loaded up on the western tales and
 silly twaddle as typified by the sex magazines
 and a magazine such as amazing stories with
 the unique the bizarre-is a relief

    i have however a fault to find with amazing
 stories  cant understand why you reprint
 any of the verne stories  have for one never
 liked them they are dry and to my mind
 poorly written

   the hackensaw stories were ordinary  as
 were the fosdick tales i didnt care for them
 personally nor for poes stories

   the moon hoax was-rotten it does not
 belong in your magazine if you intend to live up to
 scientifiction

    stories by england wells serviss bv writers
 who can and do combine scientific facts and
 well-written fiction into an interesting and grip
 ping tale are what i want and it is i under-
 stand your aim to give us that if you do this
 there is no reason why circulation will not increase
 to warrant the issue twice a month

   so far i have not missed a number have
 watched the newsstands around publication date

                       harry v spurung
                       elgin 

    the curiosity of the criticism by this writer
 is that he finds fault with the best authors in
 the way of pseudo-science the moon hoax is
 an absolute classic when it was published in
 the middle of the last  century thousands of
 people believed in it implicitly and it stands as a
 monument to human credulity he finds fault
 with jules verne and edgar allan poe two of the
 greatest writers of amazing stories and we find
 from other letters from our correspondents that the
 stories which he dislikes are generally admired-

  germs and their possibilities

 editor amving stories

    shortly after reading the october issue of your
 magazine i discovered the following article in
 a railroad monthly the fact struck me that the
 clipping would probably interest the readers of
 amazing stories in connection with alexander
 snyders blasphemers plateau

    heres to bigger and better amazing stories
 some months ago professor heinrich bcehhohl
 of frankfurt germany invented a method of
 plating gold on the surface of disease germs this
 makes the germs larger so that they are easier to
 see under the microscope very probably the
 whole world is full of these extremely tiny in-
 visible creatures they arc not much larger than
 some chemical molecules professor bechhold be-
 lieves that his investigations arc likely to discover
 the link between living matter and dead matter
 he believes that he will find that certain kinds of
 chemical molecules are really alive if this proves
 true it will change many of our ideas concerning
 the nature of life it may even make it possible
 professor bechhold thinks to create life in the
 laboratory

                         c raymond neison

 we thank our reader for the interesting clip-
 ping which he has forwarded us an extract from
 which we publish above

 asregards the concluding wish we certainly hope
 to make further increase at an early date in the
 size of amazing stories and our humble efforts are
 certainly devoted to making it constantly better al-
 though we honestly think and we are supported in
 this view by our readers that it is a very good
 magazine now-editor

yhe

  when i saw the lirst issue h vmrr-mni

i rejoiced greatly for it seemed just the one
needed to fill a long-felt want but as i eagerly
read each issue as it appeared on the newsstand 
become filled with an increasing sense of disap-
pointment and i will tell you why

  in the first place you must admit that your
magazine appeals to and is printed for a certain
definite class of readers now those readers if
i may at all judge them by myself have long been
interested in that type of fiction by this i mean
that it is not a taste suddenly acquired

  now those same readers again like myself have
been taking advantage of every opportunity to
gratify themselves and so the works of men like
h g wells jules verne and garrett serviss are
old stuff to them the works of these men
are standard in any public library and easily pro-
cured

  surely there arc enough scientifiction stories
which have not been before the public for years
in book form to maintain properly your excellent
idea

                       ralph h campbell
                       toledo ohio

  i from letters written to us by our appreciative
readers we have found that what you call old
stuff stories reprinted from old books are greatly
desired by many of them where we publish these
reprints we are careful to select the best and we
definitely know that many of our readers are de-
lighted to ee their old friends whom they may
not have met if we may use that expression for
years presented to them again in our columns
remember that jules verne was a sort of shake-
speare in science fiction and we would feel derelict
if we did not give his stories in our columns
some of his tales give an admirable picture of for-
eign lands the description of iceland in the
story entitled a trip to the center of the
earth is absolutely accurate as well as graphic
on the other hand thousands of readers have
yet to read jules verne and h g wells stories
for the lirst time-and then too we print more
and more new stories-editor

a trimonthly suggestion

editor amazing stories

  in your june issue of amazing stories you re-
quest a readers vote of the proper interval be-
tween each new issue of your intensely interesting
magazine if you can keep it at the same high
level as your first three issues have been surely
twice a month would be better than only once in
fact i think that three times a month would be
best that would give just about the right inter-
val to read one issue before the next arrived

  i will certainly buy it twice a month if it
appears that often but i think that weekly
would be too much of a good thing for it is a
fairly large magazine and should not be rushed
through

  please do not let this magazine run to humor
one humorous story a month is all right but 
feel that two are a little bit too much

  one other complaint i dont know how other
readers feel but it seems to me that you rather
strain at things when you announce that the
stories are probable and stress their value to the
future of science i notice that in your last
issue you have broken away from this stories
such as the crystal egg for example may be
founded  a possibility though i doubt the suc-
cess of any such means certainly there is noth-
ing prophetic about it infinite vision is at
least based on science

   feeling as i do that the stories chief aim is to
amuse and if possible to also impart a little in-
formation or stir the imagination a little or
both i do not see the need for insisting hat ilic
crystal egg is workable in short present the
story on its own merits rather than try tq irajj
dubious science to its support

  your custom of giving pach story a brief in-
troduction is especially commendable  hope you
will iqt tjunk from the flboye tjiat i dislike your
tpagazinc a i buy cach copy the nioiuout it
gets on the newsstands you pan spc that j really
enjoy it

                                t iy brftt
                                spokane wash

  hve can only affirm what has been for many
years a firm belief with us that stories of the
bpe that vc publish are prophetic in a striking
number of oases we do present every story on
its own merits qf cqprse and we cotisider that
stories given in onr column need no dubious science
tq support them but we think they often give
what may be termed-prophetic science the im
possible my bo impossible only today suppose
one had tried to tell washington about the tele-
phone radio x-ray or radium it would certainly
have seeme most preposterous and ridiculous to
him or wqrsp

  ve certainly appreciate your goqd wishes and
complimentary and other criticisms-editor

i do not like these stones

why

station x-ery clever but the sacrifice of
macrae was horrible and the whole story some-
what unpleasant

the thing from-outside-entirely too mor-
bid-horrible and extremely unpleasant this story
is one reason why i wouldnt like to have my boy
read the magazine although otherwise i would be
glad to have him do so

                            a van rooy
                            villa park 

it is so curious to see how different readers
are affected by the same story many people
have admired station x extremely but you and
another correspondent find fault with it after
all the sacrifice of macrae is not as horrible as
the destruction wrought during the battle scene

the thing from-outside has impressed us
as a very powerful story although we must admit
that the combination of the super-natural with the
almost arctic desolation of alaska makes up rather
a dreary picture we quite fail to take your point
of view about this depicting of the natural wilder-
ness with its super-natural tenant and we do not
think it would hurt your boy to read it-editor

some valued suggestions

editor amazing stories

as your magazine proceeds it seems to grow
better and better i am very glad that it is to
become a bi-monthly but there arc some things
i do not like about it

one is that you are not publishing books that
arc sequels in order you gave the purchase
of the north pole before the moon story

i am glad you are going to publish some of
edgar rice burroughs books but please pub-
lish them in sequel order

i enjoyed station x to the utmost the idea
of transferring identities was also the subject of
a story by it g wells

until the abyss i had read every one of
your h g wells stories before i read them in
a book called the country of the blind and
other stories

you said in one issue we have a good many
of these famous stories by clement fezandie
and yet you have published but two

i would like you some time to publish the stories
that have appeared in science and invention
including the first dr hackcnsaw stories

                      your enthusiastic reader
                      meredith gardner
                      austin texas

your criticisms arc quite interesting and wc
value highly your suggestions if the magazine
really grows better and better we feel that it is
largely due to the appreciation expressed and felt
also though unexpressed by our readers it is
not certain when it will become a bi-monthly
but wc are hoping that that will happen at an
early date appreciating both your commendation
and your criticisms wc wish to state that letters
like yours arc most welcome clement fezandie
will be back soon lack of space prevented us
from publishing his stories up to now-editor
