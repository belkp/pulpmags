a xj u s t b va munsey company f orning have you used fears soap in the summer time it is well to remember that in going from home changed conditions are temporarily experienced which often act unpleasantly upon the skin

       the best safeguard against such skin troubles
   is the frequent use of pears soap which pro-
   tects the skin by its soft pleasant emollient action
   and at the same time insures the fullest beauty of
   complexion of which the skin is capable

      the greatest skin specialists and the most
   celebrated beauties of the last  years have
   testified that in hygienic and beautifying properties

     no soap has ever equalled pears

      all rights secured

of all scented soaps peaks otto of hose is the best
                 the most wonderful
               musical instrument the
               world has ever known

                        wonderful indeed youll say after
                        hearing the victrola for this new instru-
                        ment is the greatest step forward made in
                        any musical instrument for many a day-since
                        the advent of the victor

                                the victrola is the first and only instrument
of its kind it is not simply a cabinet containing
another instrument but is a complete instrument
in itself-specially designed and constructed and
embodying new and exclusive patented features

    a handsome cabinet to outward appearances grace-
ful in design and beautiful in its simplicity but what
a world of melody it gives forth and what a wonder-
fully pure and mellow tone never before were the
great masterpieces of music-all the splendid victor
music-played so sweetly and perfectly

       where does the music come from you ask beneath the lid of the
   victrola is a turntable  which the victor record is placed from there the
   tone-waves are carried through the tapering arm down to the sounding board
   surface which amplifies and reflects them and the melody floats out from behind
   the small doors which can be regulated to make the music loud or soft at will

       this then is the victrola-the most wonderful of all musical instruments
    but you cant know how wonderful it really is until you hear it for the victrola
    has a tone-quality such as is possessed by no other	-

    instrument

         hear the victrola today at the nearest victor dealers-he
    will gladly play it for you look for the victor dog on the
    inside of the lid

when the world stood still

by johnston mcculley

 being probable chapters in united states history showing how
 an invention and a woman saved the country

chapter i

 a million men have died already

out of the west there flashed a
shaft of bright light the watch-
ers at the washington aeroplane
depot hailed it with cries of glad
relief they watched as it dropped into
a focus as it searched the heavens and
finally rested upon the depot then it
disappeared for a moment and a red
light shot out and flashed back and forth
through the air

shes signaling eperson cried

 i didnt catch it answered captain
goodwin  lets go into the station

  the military man led the way as they
ran across the broad steel platform up -
the winding stairs and to the signal-
tower they burst into a room where
wireless receivers flashed their tiny blue 
sparks of intelligence where the steady
crashing of conflicting currents of elec-
tricity made a continual din where coat-
less men the  perspiration streaming
down their pale faces stooped over key-
boards and tables consulted maps read
yards and yards of tape

   the aeroplane signalman  captain
goodwin demanded

   on the balcony sir an attendant
replied

  goodwin raced to the balcony eper-
son following closely the signalman
was snapping off a stream of green light
of great intensity a single flash of red
came from the approaching air-craft

     s

  good morning sir the signalman
 said catching sight of goodwins pale
 face

  her message man this is no time
 for greetings 

  she says she is coming in to report
 sir-thats all

  is it the aragon 

   it is sir

  she didnt give details-didnt say
 what she was going to report

 nosir

 captain goodwin grasped the oper-
 ator by the shoulders and whirled him
 around until the eyes of the two men
 glowed into each others less than six
 inches apart

  youre lying to me youre holding
 something back  the captain screamed

  i can read the lie in your eves
 tt jn

  dont lie what are you holding
 back

  she didnt say what she was going to
 report sir

  but she said something besides ma-
 king the statement she was coming in
 what was it

  she didnt-

  tell me the truth  goodwin cried
 very well-ill tell you the truth
 the operator answered hurling himself
 free  this is her message-that she has
 important reports to make that they are
 for the president only-

  i am the presidents chief of staff
 fool 


the all-story magazine

   and the aragon added sir that
under no circumstances was  to inform
you of the coming report-that the re-
port was for the president and not for
you

   you cur 

  the operator sprang forward quickly
and came to a stop within a few feet of
where goodwin stood his eyes flashing
anger his hands clenched

  if  were you captain goodwin
he said  i wouldnt say that again 

   you dare to threaten me ill have
you thrown into jail for treason im
your superior officer-

   i belong to the signal corps sir 

   and still i am your superior olfi-
cer-i the presidents chief of staff

   you have not the right to call me a
cur 

  eperson ran forward and sprang be-
tween the men

   fools-both of you  he cried
 youre letting this thing get on your
nerves this is no time for trivial quar-
rels goodwin wake up think and
this operator-hed better get back tohis
business

  goodwin turned on one heel and start-
ed for the stairway eperson remained
behind and patted the tired operator on
the shoulder

  never mind captain- goodwins
words he said kindly  this business
has unstrung all of us and then you
hurt him a little with what you said

   i told him the truth mr eperson
he demanded to know the truth its
none of my business why the captain of
the aragon sent such a message but it is
my business to receive that message and
see that it is delivered according to in-
structions

   i understand eperson replied
 just let it drop will you

    if you ask it sir

   thank you going down to the
room 

   no-i must remain on duty here un-
til relieved

   ah  how long have you been on 
   twenty hours sir

  twenty hours at signal work

   i- know it is dangerous sir im
liable to make a mistake that will cause
trouble sometimes i get dizzy and my
eyes can scarcely read the lights i made

the aragon repeat her message so as to
be sure there was no mistake but what
can we do every signal man that
could be spared was rushed to the front
they need them worst out there

  the operator waved a hand toward
the west eperson looked in that direc-
tion watching the bright bow-light of
the approaching aragon

   how soon will she be in  he asked
the operator

 the aragon sir in about an
hour i think she was one hundred and
forty miles out when she reported

   thanks again well i must go be-
low take care of yourself boy

   thank you sir

  eperson hurried across the signal bal-
cony and descended the steel stairway
captain goodwin was pacing the floor
of the operating-room his hands clenched
at his sides he was cursing

  an operator who was off duty for a
few minutes approached eperson

   youre captain goodwins friend
sir he said  and we wish youd try to
get him out of this room we know of
course sir that the anxiety is crazing
him but he is crazing us too and we
have to have good nerves

   he knocked cadwaller down a few
seconds ago just because cadwaller got
in his way captain goodwins nerves
are broken sir we cant have him
knocking operators round like that-
were short of men now

  eperson bit his lip and looked an-
noyed

   ill do what i can he said and
walked around a keyboard and across
toward goodwin

   what were you doing so long on the
balcony  the captain demanded  are
you against me too eperson  

  nonsense man youre all un-
strung  

  unstrung goodwin cried reeling
against the wall he threw back his
head and laughed-a laugh that was not
pleasant to hear  you call me un-
strung who wouldnt be

  the west is drenched with blood the
sea is filled with shot-riddled ships the
people are crying for food to west and
east and south and north there are
widows and orphans by the million ep-
erson our great cities are in ruins-
when the world stood still



except those along the atlantic and
our last chance-no it isnt our last
chance for even if they whip us out
there-

   hush   eperson warned  there
are ears here 

  they may as well hear it that
battle is decisive it is our last chance
but well never give up every man
of us will go down to death first the
united states of america never gave up
yet and please heaven they never will
eperson i got a telegram from cincin-
nati an hour ago they are recruiting a
regiment of women out there think
of it-women so you see well never
give up perhaps you dont under-
stand-

   im a britisher said eperson sim-
ply  and so you see i do understand

  goodwin looked at his watch snapped
it shut and returned it to his pocket

   two oclock in the morning he
said  and we havent had a message
since three yesterday afternoon what
are-they doing out there in the west

   well know soon said eperson
 the aragon will be in in less than an
hour

   the aragon   goodwin exploded
 with that fool captain howard in
command the contemptible pup  why
do you suppose he sent that message-
made a fool of me before that signal-
man  

   i dont know goodwin calm your-
self come out into the depot and get
the air the troops have crowded out
the public-there are not many people
about

  goodwin allowed eperson to guide
him from the operating-room as they
stepped out upon the great receiving
platform they could see that the aragon
was much nearer her bow-lights much
brighter

   shes flying fast said eperson

   but why in the world doesnt how-
ard send his messages ahead of him
doesnt he think we want to know
doesnt he think the president wants to
know that the people want to know
doesnt he-

   wait eperson said  perhaps
he has some reason

   the aragon is turning isnt she
going to land here 

   of course shell land here good-
win calm yourself 

  the chief of staff paced back and
forth across the steel platform

   calm  he cried  who could be
calm in such a case except a britisher
it isnt your country that is tottering 

   goodwin  eperson exclaimed
 vou forget that two months ago brit-
ain formally tendered the united states
her armies and her navies to help you
against the asiatics britain meant it
goodwin it is as much to britains in-
terest and to the interest of every other
european nation to see you whip them
as it is to yours we offered our aid-
so did germany-and france-

   and we refused exulted goodwin
 we told you it was our quarrel

   which it isnt it started with you
of course but every european nation is
back of you if you go down and out
well have to take it up the asiatics
cannot be allowed to win- and maybe
they havent

   thats our hope-that they havent
said goodwin in a changed voice  if
they have-well ill accept that regi-
ment of cincinnati women and ill call
for more regiments of women-

   is it worth it eperson asked
worth it goodwin cried ep-
erson every city and town may be in
ruins our capital may be burned our
armies scattered all slain but women and
boys and old men-and still well fight
weve drenched the nation in a sea of
blood already-a second drenching will
not hurt

   nine-tenths of the available able-
bodied men of -the country are out west
there now-facing a number equally
large if not larger if they are wiped
out what can we do-but fight with
women  

   britain and germany have their
fleets and transports ready man they
can sail at an hours notice ask for
them 

   no thundered goodwin  not
unless we win 

   why youll not need them if you
win 

  goodwin laughed

 wont we he cried well
need them for if we win i will throw
every available man in the field therell


the all-story magazine

be  quarter the asiatics have shown
us none well drive them into the sea
then embark  the pacific and go to
their own battle-fields and well put them
to the sword - men women and chil-
dren-

   you talk like some brute of the
middle ages

   who would not look what they
have done to us do you know my am-
bition eperson 

   ambition-you i thought you
were without ambition you-chief of
staff and yet you hold only the rank of
captain and will accept nothing higher
you the greatest man in your country
to-day before whom every one bows
whom the president himself looks to
for counsel before his cabinet officers-
you a mere captain and yet you now
sav you have ambition well-what is
it

  captain goodwin wheeled and faced
him in the path of light from a near-
by window the warriors face was stern

   eperson he said  my ambition is
to be the man to wipe the asiatics off
the map of the world-not the asiatic
countries but the asiatics themselves i
dont want one left alive i want to
have them hunted in every corner of the
earth and slain like dogs i want-

   goodwin are you mad-are you
inhuman  

   that is my ambition said goodwin
sternly

   you mean it  

   i mean it eperson

  the britisher turned away

   im sorry he said  weve been
good friends for years

  what do you mean eperson

   simply that i admire a warrior that
never cries surrender-but i do not ad-
mire a warrior who could exterminate a
conquered foe who would cry  thumbs
down to a vanquished rival youre
mad goodwin  youre unstrung 

   i mean what i said goodwin de-
clared  if that changes your friend-
ship so be it 

   goodwin 

   so be it i say im done with
you 

  eperson looked at him for a moment
then turned and walked slowly across
the platform

   hes mad he muttered  but hell
be all right to-morrow-yes liell be all
right to-morrow 

  captain goodwin remained  the
landing-stage watching the aragon she
was within a few miles now and coming
up swiftly the chief of staff could see
men moving on her deck could see all
her lights could see her gigantic wings
beating the air and could hear the dro-
ning music they made

  he retreated to the edge of the stage
as the great air-craft hovered over the
depot men were crying to each other
within but trained troopers held them
back no person except captain good-
win chief of staff was on the stage as
the aragon gracefully settled into posi-
tion

  from the streets below came the cries
from thousands of throats lights were
flashing throughout the city the people
were eager for the news good r ill

  as the ship rested lightly in its place
and its wings ceased beating the air a
landing stage was thrown out goodwin
was upon it before it touched the steel
flooring and running up into the ship
the first man he met was captain how-
ard who was hurrying toward the stage
 wait  goodwin commanded
captain howard fell back and saluted
 well sir he asked

   you sent a message-an impudent
message-to the receiving station 

   i did not intend to be impudent sir
my message was that i had important
reports for the president only and that
the president was to be awakened at
once

   that was not all

  no sir i said also that the re-
ports were for the president personally
and not for his chief of staff i said
that to make sure the president would
be awakened it is imperative

   has the president any secrets in this
matter from his chief of staff good-
win demanded

   you misunderstand sir i carry
with me an envoy from the hostile
armies who wishes to see the president
personally general bell chief in the
field granted this envoy safe conduct
and promised that he should see the
president

   captain howard goodwin cried
when the world stood still



 if you have brought to this city a man
of the enemy who is to propose our
capitulation ill have you shot for a
coward 

  howard turned white then walked up
close to the other man

   perhaps it is not to propose our
capitulation  he thundered

 what do you mean goodwin
cried  we have won  

   we have had much the best of the
days fighting sir and before you call
me a coward again captain goodwin
have the goodness to remember that i
have taken my ship and my men across
the enemys field of battle that my ship
has been riddled with shot that her decks
have been washed with blood-while you
paced the landing-stage at washington
a thousand miles or so away out of
harms zone 

  goodwin sputtered with wrath finally
he spoke

   you want to see me at the front
eh  he cried  you shall see me there
soon sir youll see me drive the
asiatics into the sea but as to your
words just now-a court-martial shall de-
cide sir between the two of us 

   i am willing sir captain howard
replied  and now if you please ill
prepare to go to the president allow
me to suggest sir that you make your
way to the war department for youll
be needed in the council-chamber

    make my way where it pleases me
best said the chief of staff

  he walked angrily down the stage
went into the depot and descended to the
street the news of the days victory
had gone before him cheers greeted
him as he emerged within sight of the
throng

   you shall have your revenge he
said stepping out upon a balcony and
waving his hands at the thousands below
him  well not stop until weve driven
the asiatics from the face of the earth 
a tempest of cheers greeted his speech
he got into a carriage and the crowds
gave way for it as the driver whipped up
the horses the driver was an old man
-he had three sons somewhere in the
west sleeping in army uniforms and in
nameless graves there were tears in
the old mans eyes as he guided the
horses through the crowded streets

   he said hed drive them from the
face of the earth the old driver said to
himself  that means years and years
more of war years and years more-
and a million men have died already 

chapter ii

 the sun shall not rise to-day

  once out of the crowd which thronged
the streets surrounding the aeroplane de-
pot the driver lashed his horses into a
gallop and the carriage of the chief of
staff dashed through the avenues long
since the use of automobiles had been
abolished likewise the use of individual
air-craft for the navy of the air had use
for all fuel supplies

  captain goodwin lay back against the
cushions his eyes closed his breath com-
ing in quick gasps his head pained
terribly his fingers twitched nervously

  yes-eperson had been right he was
all unstrung he didnt feel like himself
at all what were the words he had
said to eperson to that crowd well-
 matter they would amount to noth-
ing his head felt queer he wondered
whether his mind was giving way under
the great strain

  the carriage drew up before the war
department building at last and a wait-
ing trooper threw open the door cap-
tain goodwin passed the soldier without
acknowledging his salute hurried up the
steps and went up to his own office a
sleepy aide sprang to his feet from a
chair as the chief of staff entered

   anything  goodwin snapped

   reports from the south and west
sir but not from the field of battle
weve lost three more ships in the gulf
of mexico the german emperor has
given out an interview in which he says
his fleets are ready to sail in an hours
time and that unless the united states
accepts his offer of help he may take the
initiative and forward his transports to
mexico having his troops enter the west-
ern country across the border

   hell hardly do that i think good-
win muttered smiling

   the several chiefs and cabinet offi-
cers are in the council-room sir awaiting
the president

   very well


the all-story magazine

   youll go in at once sir

 no cried goodwin ill go
when they request my presence 

  the aide looked astonished

   very well sir he said

  the chief of staff entered his private
office threw open a desk and took down
a file of papers again he paused and
placed his hands to his head as though
to slide the pain that was there

   i wonder- lie began

  in the outer office there were voices
hut the chief of staff gave them no atten-
tion messengers were always arriving
with reports and maps and requisitions
for supplies that the department could
not grant presently some one knocked
at his door the chief of staff did not
respond he felt that he wanted no in-
terruption

  an hour passed there came another
knock at the door

   well   goodwin cried

  his aide entered and stood before him

   the president requests your presence
in the eouncil-room sir

   tell the president ill be there in a
few minutes the chief of staff replied

  again the aide looked astonished but
he carried out the order goodwin fin-
ished smoking his cigar rose and passed
through a private door and a private cor-
ridor to the council-chamber he was
still angry still unable to control him-
self

  he threw open the door and entered
the chamber without speaking to those
assembled he made his way to his ac-
customed seat and sat down he heard
the presidents voice

   we have waited some time for you
captain goodwin

   i beg your pardon-there were duties
that had to be performed the chief of
staff replied

  he raised his head the members of
the cabinet were before him the chiefs
of departments of the army and navy
captain howard of the aragon was
there too all were looking at goodwin

   well  goodwin asked

   we have considered everything in-
formally before asking you to join the
conference the president said  the
matter can now be placed before you in
a complete state

   reports from general bell in the

field tell of the first days battle-yes-
terdays-in central illinois we also
have reports from wyoming where the
second army is engaged these reports
were relayed to us by the aragon that
is the only means of communication re-
maining as you well know

   well   asked goodwin again

   we have checked the advance of the
asiatics in illinois have turned their
flank and in wyoming we have been
successful too the greater army of
the asiatic advance now in illinois and
wisconsin may find itself hemmed in by
our two armies extermination would be
possible of course in that event

   but the enemy is outdone captain
goodwin we may now give thanks-
for the end of this cruel war is in sight

  the end the beginning you
mean  goodwin cried springing to his
feet  mr president-and you gentle-
men-i held out all along against asking
aid of any european nation because it
was my pride to have it written on his-
torys pages that we conquered unaided
we have conquered-and alone

   now gentlemen i am in favor of
taking the aid of every nation that offers
help of sending thousands of battle-
ships and transports to the asiatic coun-
tries of sending fleets of air-ships of
sending gigantic armies of putting to
the sword and bayonet every asiatic-
man woman or child-of exterminating
the race it is the only revenge we can
exact 

   captain goodwin said the presi-
dent with sorrow in his voice  i regret
that you speak so i have had it reported
that you uttered such sentiments in pub-
lic a short time ago do you realize
what it means it would be inhuman
a hardship upon our own people

   our country is in ruins as far east
as illinois there is not a town of con-
sequence standing in the west corn-
fields have been turned into cemeteries
these past five years we are bankrupt
if peace comes now and the great nat-
ural resources of our country are properly
conserved we can be a prosperous nation
again in a few years but the pain and
sorrow already caused will endure a cen-
tury think captain goodwin would
it not be better to end it now-with
honor
when the world stood still	

  with honor goodwin cried

   yes-with honor captain howard
has brought us on the aragon an envoy
from the enemy he is count kashuma
he asks us to sign a peace protocol to
hold while representatives consider terms
of ending this war count kashuma
admits that the asiatics are weary of the
useless struggle

   he comes at an excellent time-now
that his armies face defeat sneered
goodwin  why did he not come three
months ago when he was victorious  

   the man who cries  enough  is en-
titled to some consideration the presi-
dent replied

   and he wants a peace protocol eh 
 i have said as much captain good-
win

   i am not in favor of it i am in
favor of calling upon europe to enter a
war of extermination

   european nations have assured me
within the past few hours that they too
want this war to end and trade relations
resumed when we were in danger they
stood ready to help now that we are
turned conquerors they request that we
accept the chance offered by the enemy
it is a protocol they ask for captain if
when the representatives meet their terms
do not suit us we are at liberty to follow
precedent

   give them their protocol  goodwin
cried it is now four oclock in the
morning send word that peace endures
to-day and to-night but when the sun
rises to-morrow morning the cannon
shall roar again unless in the meantime
the asiatics agree to our demands

   i am glad that you make even this
concession the president said  you
have been a valuable man captain and
i should hate to have to disagree with
you now but what can representatives
do in twenty-four hours

   anything when they know they
must said goodwin

   let us have count kashuma in the
president said

  an attendant went out and returned
followed by the count in uniform

   count kashuma the president said
 we have been considering your propo-
sition captain goodwin here thinks
the protocol should endure only until sun-
rise to-morrow morning

  the asiatic turned and looked at
goodwin keenly then he faced the
president and spoke in english in a
penetrating tone

   your excellency he said  it was
because we feared something like this
that it was requested i see you before
you held conference with captain good-
win he is known to our people as a
cruel relentless man whose methods of
warfare are almost inhuman

  sir goodwin exclaimed

  the president silenced him with a
wave of the hand

   continue count kashuma he said

   we have fought for five years the
count said  and with honor to both
sides you americans are a brave people
a nation of fighters we of the east are
weary of the long war although up to
the present time victory has been with
us as much as with you our women are
weeping their hearts away our treasuries
are empty our homes are wrecked be-
cause of absent loved ones our fields lie
idle and the weeds grow in our streets
the great conflict was inevitable as wise
men said half a century ago

   we have suffered and you have suf-
fered honors have been even why
not cease this war why not let us take
our armies away why not make terms
of peace that will be honorable to both
in days gone by history tells us the
united states was always ready to en-
force peace among the nations of the
world i do not say this in the nature of
a rebuke

   it is a rebuke justly given and de-
served the president said in a tone of
sorrow he looked across the table at
captain goodwin  we have drifted
far from our early principles he added

   you mean that i am the cause of
this change  the chief of staff asked

   i did not intimate that sir the
president responded  let us have an
end of this count kashuma go back
to your army on the aragon and com-
municate with your commanders cap-
tain goodwin will communicate with ours
immediately this word shall go forth-
that a peace protocol shall endure until
sunrise to-morrow morning that repre-
sentatives of the asiatics shall come im-
mediately to this building under safe
conduct and meet our representatives


the all-story magazine

terms of peace shall be discussed we
will see whether anything can be ac-
complished under captain goodwins
plan

  it is a short time to discuss the set-
tlement of five years war count
kashuma said

   not necessarily goodwin put in
 i shall lay terms before you if you
agree-well and good if you do not-
the war continues

   these terms i trust will be honor-
able to both sides said the count

   they shall be what i and the presi-
dent see fit to make them  goodwin
answered

   captain goodwin cried the secre-
tary of war  you seem to think you are
dictating in this matter you seem to
forget-

   i forget nothing sir goodwin in-
terrupted  and i remember that many
times you and your colleagues would
have acted like cowards and white-
livered curs except for me

  every man in the room sprang to his
feet and glared down at goodwin the
president walked a step forward

   captain goodwin he said  you
have insulted a peace envoy here under
safe conduct you have insulted the
president of the united states and his
cabinet officers and you have spoken
words which show that you are a man
dangerous to the best interests of our
country

   the united states shall not be ruled
by a military dictator sir  begin to
fear that i have trusted you too much
already that i have listened too long to
your counsel your sword sir 

 what do you mean goodwin
cried springing to his feet

   i mean that you are no longer my
chief of staff that you are no longer an
officer of the united states army i shall
appoint a new chief to-morrow

  goodwin drew his sword broke it
across his knee and threw the fragments
at the presidents feet

   there sir  he cried  i am no
longer chief of staff of your army but
i command the army just the same 

  you mean treason cried all in a
breath

   if it is treason to take things in hand
when other men would dishonor the coun-

try then it is treason i command the
army-it obeys my commands there
shall be no peace protocol see these
-and these 

  he took from his blouse bundles of
messages

   they shall be on their way to the
front in ten minutes  he cried backing
to the door  the commanders in the
field take their orders from me

   stop these messages countermand
these orders if you can place me under
military arrest if you dare the people
are with me in this at sunrise the can-
non shall roar again ill wipe the
asiatics from the face of the earth ill
begin at sunrise this morning 

  he turned and dashed through the
door slammed it shut leaving them
standing there appalled unconsciously
the president muttered the words the old
carriage-driver had used just before

  and a million men have died
already 

  the secretary of war threw himself
into a chair and sobbed his overwrought
nerves breaking other strong men in
that room were in tears count kashuma
stood to one side of the table his face
show ing no emotion- 

   he will begin at sunrise this morn-
ing echoed an aide

   then the sun shall not rise to-day 
exclaimed a piercing voice from the other
door

chapter iii

  the world is standing still
  all turned

  professor selester stood there-one of
the greatest scientists of the age honored
by scientific men throughout the world
a cousin of the president and one- of the
presidents household

  he was a little dried-up man of fifty
years his face was unsoiled by beard
and every bone in it seemed to show
through the tightly stretched skin his
eyes-black and piercing-peered forth
at them

   what do you mean professor seles-
ter  one of the group asked

   i mean exactly what i have said
the sun shall not rise this morning do
you wish it would not do you wish
when the world stood still



  darkness would shroud the earth to pre-
  vent captain goodwin carrying out his
  purpose he is a man of his word and
  he has said he will not renew hostilities
  until the sun rises would you like to
  know that the sun will not rise until you
  have time to cope with the situation

     if that could only be sighed the
 president

     it can be replied professor seles-
  ter  give the word if you wish such a
  thing to come about

   are you sane do you mean it
 cried the others

    i am sane-and i mean it but the
 president must give the word

     why should you await the word from
 any one in the name of humanity do
 this thing if you can-

   the secretary of war sprang to his
 feet

     were all insane-all unstrung  he
  cried what are you talking about
  what human being can bid the sun stand
  still and have it obey

     not the sun but the earth replied
professor selester he turned again to
 the president  will you give the word
cousin  he asked

   what would it mean

     it would mean night until matters
 are adjusted it would mean a stop to
 this cruel war until the daylight came
 again and the daylight will not come
 again until you give the word for that too

     i mean it will be four oclock in the
  morning eternally until you desire the
  earth to resume its normal movements
  it means eternal day on the other side of
  the world of cpurse are you willing to
  take the responsibility cousin  

     i am willing to do anything to save
  my country from further useless blood-
  shed replied the president  if you
  could only do this thing hold off the
  sunrise until we can cope with the situa-
  tion-

     i can do it cousin i have done other
  things

    yes yes-we know the nations of
 the world have knelt before you and your
 scientific works but this-stopping the
 world in its tracks-

     thats exactly what i can do re-
  plied professor selester  i can make
  the world stand still and when such an
  event has served its purpose i can make

the old world continue on her endless
journey

   this is the age of science said the
secretary of war  but such a thing as
you propose professor cannot be done
and if it could your offer would be
worthless now the time is too short
sunrise is less than two hours away

   the time is not too short for every-
thing is in readiness the scientist re-
plied  i have been prepared for several
days waiting until such a thing should be
needed that tower on the hill which
i built last summer is my workshop
from that tower i can make the world
stand still

   enough  the president cried
 whether you can do this thing or not

i	do not know but i give the word
if you can delay the rising of the sun
do it and the rest of us-why theres
no time to be lost goodwin-

   goodwin is crazed the secretary of
war said

   yes he is crazed replied the presi-
dent  he is not like himself has not
been for several days i have noticed it
we must do what we can to prevent him
carrying out his purpose secure him if
you can place him in irons not as a
traitor but as an insane person he has
served his country well up to now let
us not degrade him

  professor selester pushed the secretary
of war to one side as he said

   the telephone-i must have it 
the others made way for him and he
sat down before the instrument

   go on with your work he said to
the others  pay no attention to me
ill do my part in this affair go ahead
and issue your orders to your armies stop
goodwin-do anything you wish every-
thing will be as before except that the
world will stand still

   we must secure goodwin said the
secretary of war

  he beckoned several young officers to
him and issued orders the cabinet
officers went away one by one presently
no one remained except the professor the
president and count kashuma

   i desire to be alone the professor
said

  the president arose and opened the
door to an adjoining room he motioned
for the count to enter


the all-story magazine

  professor selester called a number a
 girls sweet voice answered him

    selma  he asked

    yes father

    everything is all right

    yes father

   start the machinery at once as i
 showed you

    you are going to do it then 

   it is the only way daughter more
 blood will flow if we do not start the
 machinery-quickly-and reverse the big
 machine a little just as i demonstrated
 watch for my return

    yes father

    throw the current into the protectors
 too and let no one conje near the tower
 except myself when  come let me in
 if i am alone but not otherwise you
 understand daughter not otherwise

    i understand father

   throw the switch while i hold the
 line

  the girl left the instrument at the
 other end of the wire in a few moments
 she was back again

    i have done it father

  and everything is working all right
   yes

    keep it so until  return

   yes father

   professor selester hung up the receiver
 got up from the chair chuckled to him-
 self and rubbed his hands together in
 satisfaction

   we shall see he muttered the
 world stands still very well we shall
 see if war continues

  he started to make his way across the
 big room walking slowly his head bent
 low on his breast still rubbing his hands
 half-way to the door through which the
 president and count kashuma had dis-
 appeared he came to a quick stop that
 other door had been thrown open vio-
 lently

  captain goodwin had staggered into
 the room his eyes aflame a smoking re-
 volver in his hand a bunch of messages
 in the other he slammed the door again
 and shot the bolt

  hounds he screamed

  professor selester cowered against a
 table and captain goodwin turned and
 saw him

  so the little scientist he cried
 his lips twisting into a gruesome smile

 and what are you doing here  to
your kennel you this is a place for
warriors not scientists we want no old
women here quit the building or ill
have you shot for a spy 

  professor selester did not answer but
tried to walk toward the door some one
was beating upon the one goodwin had
just entered there was a storm of cries
in the outer corridor some of the words
made the professors faceturn paler still

   well  the captain cried  are you
going to leave the building shall i
pour hot lead into you you rat

   ill go-ill go  the professor mut-
tered

   not through that door the president
is in there and that asiatic is with him
not into that door but out the back way
im going in to see the president my-
self

   youll not hurt the president 
selester screamed

   stand out of my way 

   youll not hurt- began selester

  the outer door fell with a crash and
half a dozen troopers rushed across it and
into the room weapons in their hands
goodwin turned to face them firing into
the mob one trooper fell sprawling
coughing blood but the others came on
a man in front raised his rifle

   drop it  goodwin cried

  the captains revolver spoke again and
the man fell beside his comrade

   at him   a voice cried

  the opposite door opened and the
president stood framed in it

   what does this mean he demand-
ed  goodwin put up that revolver
put it up  

  the ex-chief of staff whirled on one
heel and raised the weapon

   as for you- he screamed

  there was a cry from every throat a
quick dash forward by the foremost of
the pursuing troopers the quick dash of
another from one side a spurt of flame
a cloud of smoke-and then those behind
saw the president standing wreathed in
smoke but unharmed saw goodwin on
the floor in the grasp of two troopers
saw the body of a man lying between the
captain and the president-a man who
tried in vain to rise to a sitting posture
who pressed one hand to his breast from
which gushed the blood
when the world stood still



  it was professor selester

  the president gave a cry and bent on
his knees beside the wounded man

   i tried to save you cousin the pro-
fessor muttered

   a surgeon-a surgeon  the troopers
were crying

   i tried to save you cousin

   but at what a cost the president
said  and all is lost now captain
goodwin sent his orders before the men
got to him so i was just told in the other
room now you are wounded and your
work-

  the president ceased speaking for the
professors head had fallen to one side
a military surgeon hurried into the room

   here first the president directed
pointing to the professor  everything
depends upon this man

  goodwin was still struggling with the
two troopers but they soon subdued him

   take him to another room and
guard him well the president directed
 ill attend to him presently see that
no news of this is spread abroad

  then they waited for the surgeons
verdict watched while he gave first aid
to the professors wound presently he
placed the wounded man back upon the
floor and stood up

   well   the president asked

   he is badly wounded

   he will die

   there is a chance to save him-if he
has good care

  	he must have the best of care have
him removed to the white house and
assign the best of nurses and physicians
i will telephone ahead myself and have
things in readiness take my carriage-
it is at the main entrance we must
save him everything depends upon him
now

   he is regaining consciousness a
trooper said

  the president bent over his cousin

  are you-all right the professor
asked

   yes yes the president answered
 well get you well cousin fight to
save yourself that will help the doctors
most weve lost now but therell come
a better time perhaps captain good-
wins orders have gone to the front and
the bloodshed will continue for a time
then-when you are able-we can let

you stop it god help our country now
a madman is wrecking its ruins 

   what was it he-what was it good-
win-said i-forget

    he said the battle would be resumed
at sunrise cousin-those were his orders
to the front we can do nothing now
nothing cried the wounded man
a wonderful light flashed in his eyes
 we have done everything he added
 i did it by telephone while you were
in the other room

  what do you mean the president
cried

    i mean that the sun will not rise this
morning no-even now-the world is
standing still 

chapter iv

 the pass does not mention you

  no one but the president heard the
words the chief executive of the na-
tion rose with the light of unbelief in his
eyes he turned and walked to a win-
dow as members of the ambulance corps
took professor selester from the room

  outside night prevailed and the
thousands of lights flashed throughout
the city soldiers hurried through the
streets to the east where the great
aeroplane depot stood flashes of red and
green told that the signalmen were talk-
ing with remote corners of the land

   the world was standing still every-
thing appeared to be the same did
professor selester speak the truth or
was he speaking from the land of de-
lirium 

    we shall know soon the president
muttered

   presently he descended to the street
and took another carriage and drove to
the white house professor selester
had been made as comfortable as possi-
ble in a room and physicians and nurses
were in attendance

 how is he  the president asked

    he is unconscious sir a physician
replied  but we hope for the best he
has a magnificent body for one so small
his vitality is little less than wonderful
when this unconsciousness is over we
will be able to tell you something more
definite i dislike to make promises
now sir but everything looks favorable
--



the all-story magazine

  the president left the sick-room and
fent to his private office he had to
consider the appointment of a new chief
of staif he had to attend to the thousand
and one things that crowd upon a ruler
in time of war he bent low over his
desk examining papers under the bright
light while an aide stood at his elbow
and his secretary dictated orders on the
other side of the room

  an hour passed then a young officer
entered the room quickly and spoke to
the aide the aide touched the president
on the arm

   i beg your pardon sir he said
 but a young lady wishes to speak to
you i think you will pardon the inter-
ruption - she is professor selesters
daughter

  let her come in here at once the
president directed

  he sighed as he dropped the report he
was reading and whirled around in his
chair the young officer went out pres-
ently returned and ushered in the young
woman she was a beautiful girl of
twenty with a wealth of dark hair and
dark eyes that peered into the very soul
of one even as did professor selesters

  the president did not know his cous-
ins daughter very well she had spent
her young womanhood at school prior to
the beginning of the great war and since
the war had begun the president had had
little time for his family and for social
duties he recognized her however at
a glance

  springing from his chair he placed an
arm round her and led her forward under
the light he raised her head and looked
into her eyes

   you must be brave little selma he
said  he is badly wounded uncon-
scious now but there is a chance the
surgeons tell me just be as brave as you
can

   ill try she replied her lips trem-
bling   cannot see him

   i am afraid not the president re-
plied  he is unconscious-and even
if he were conscious the shock of seeing
you might be fatal you know how he
loves you 

  the girls head drooped

   i shall have you called if the physi-
cians say you may see him or if there is
any immediate danger the president

 continued  how did you learn of your
 fathers wound  

  an officer notified me sir

  you know all the circumstances lit-
 tle selma he suffered to protect me

  so they told me sir any of us
 would do that

  but your father is worth more to
 his country now little selma than i am
 you know-his work-

 the girl raised her head

  his work  she echoed

  i thought you knew-

  oh yes i know  she said hastily

  he told me-just before he lost con-
 sciousness-that his work had already
 been started he was delirious of
 course-

  of course she said with evident re-
 lief

  you need not leave the house little
 selma tell them  said you were to
 remain here-near your father just
 step into this room dear ill have a
 surgeon watch and notify you if you are
 needed try to be brave-in these times
 all of us must be brave

  ill try she replied

 the president stepped away from her
 and touched a bell an officer entered
 the room

take miss selester to my wifes
apartments the president directed

  see that all her desires are obeyed as
 commands

 the officer saluted and held open the
 door but the girl turned again to the
 president	v

  one moment sir she whispered

 it-it was captain goodwin-was it
not 

  yes the president answered

  surely he did not intend to do it

 sir

  captain goodwin intended to assas-
 sinate me your father prevented it

  but surely he did not intend that
 harm to you either sir he must be
 out of his right mind

  he is little selma and he has done
 a great deal of harm we were unable
 to prevent it we do not blame him-
 the anxiety has crazed him

  and what have you done with him 

  he is held prisoner in the federal
 prison we cannot let him free of
 course in his present condition
when the world stood still



  youll not-execute him

   no selma word has gone out that
captain goodwin has gone insane
through worry and overwork we mere-
ly hold him prisoner he has served his
country well up to now heaven grant
that he may regain his right mind and be
valuable still

  the girl looked away for a moment
then turned back to the president with
a look of determination on her face

   if i could see him -she began
  you see him and why

   you do not know she said  cap-
tain goodwins son lieutenant frank
goodwin is to be my husband

   i did not know the president said
 lieutenant goodwin is an excellent
officer little selma

   and captain goodwin-he thinks a
great deal of me i believe if i could
talk with him-if i could make him
realize what he has done-perhaps it
would calm him or change him in some
way

   i am afraid you can do nothing lit-
tle girl he is violent he has wounded
several men i am having him closely
guarded

   but perhaps some time to-day
sir-

  the president patted her shoulder af-
fectionately

   i understand he said  and what
is it you want 

   just a pass-or whatever you call it
-so those officers will let me talk to
him

   i guess we can arrange that the
president said

  he sat down at his desk for a mo-
ment wrote rapidly then arose and hand-
ed her the pass

   that will enable you to see him he
said  but be careful you had bet-
ter take some one with you when you go
and id rather under the circumstances
that the  some one  shouldnt be captain
goodwins son

    i understand sir

   go to my wife now and ill have
you informed of your fathers condition
every little while

    thank you sir the girl said

  she walked through the door the aide
held open and passed down the great
corridor

   kindly step in here miss selester
the aide directed  the presidents
wife has been up since your father was
injured and ill have her come to you
at once

  the girl entered the room and the
officer bowed himself out

  as soon as he was gone the girl
rushed to the door again and looked up
and down the corridor then fled swiftly
toward a side door in a few moments
she had emerged into the open air and
was walking rapidly through the dark-
ness making her way to the street

  a carriage awaited her she sprang
into it the driver whipped up his horses
and they sped down the street three
blocks away the carriage slowed down
and a man in military uniform sprang in
it and sat down beside the girl

   you got it  he asked roughly

   yes

   good  any trouble 

   none-he never noticed

   good again thats so much the
better we will gain time

  the carriage continued its racing
through the streets neither the girl
nor the man beside her spoke

  presently the driver stopped his
horses before a great building

   were at the prison the man said
then  now remember yourself and
if you make a mistake-

   ill not make a mistake the girl
said with some impatience

   and if young goodwin puts in an
appearance-

   ill attend to him if he does

   you have the pass ready 

   i have it here

  the man sprang out and helped her
to alight together they walked up to
the main entrance the soldier on duty
there saluted

   we wish to see the commandant
the man beside the girl said

   the commandant is busy now sir
 we cannot wait we hold a pass
from the president it is imperative
this business of ours

   very well sir this way

  the soldier turned them over to an-
other and they were ushered into a wait-
ing-room it was several minutes be-
fore the commandant entered during
that time the man stood before the win-
the all-story magazine

dow looking down at the street and the
girl sat before the fireplace staring at
her feet presently the commandant
appeared the man whirled to meet
him

   colonel olgen he said  i am
captain richard testnor of the aus-
trian army the military representative of
my country here this young lady is
miss selma selester daughter of pro-
fessor selester who was shot and wound-
ed a short time ago by captain goodwin

   i have the honor to be her escort
she has a pass from the president which
authorizes her to see and speak with
captain goodwin who is one of your
prisoners as we understand it

  colonel olgen bowed and took the
pass from the girls cold hand he ex-
amined it carefully

   it is perfectly regular he said
 kindly make yourselves as comfortable
as possible for a few minutes

  he turned and left the room the man
flashed a look of satisfaction at the girl
in a few minutes colonel olgen re-
turned

   you may see him now he said
speaking to the girl  i have informed
him of your coming and he seems sur-
prised but delighted i hope you can
do something miss selester to restore
his bright brain to its normal condition
he is a valuable man when he is sane-
a very dangerous man when he is not

  colonel olgen held open the door and
the girl swept past him into the dark
corridor from the distance came the
cries of the sentries the rattling of
chains within the prison she hung
back a little as she passed from the room

  captain testnor stepped forward
quickly but colonel olgen barred the
way

   i beg your pardon captain test-
nor he said  but the pass did not
mention you you will kindly remain
behind await us here

chapter v

  dictator of the united states
captain testnors lips curved in a
sarcastic smile

   very well he said and turned back
into the room

  the door was closed behind him and
bolted and colonel olgen led the way
down the dark corridor the girl follow-
ing closely

   daylight seems to be slow in coming
this morning the commandant said
 is your father badly injured

   the surgeons say he has a chance
sir

   i hope he recovers he is a great
man

   thank you sir the girl answered
she waited beside the commandant
while a guard opened a door and al-
lowed them access to another corridor-
they walked on and on past rows and
tiers of cells past guards that paced
back and forth ceaselessly

  the girl did not raise her eyes to
meet those that peered at her from be-
hind rows of bars she clutched at the
commandants arm and hurried  be-
side him

   here the commandant directed

  she raised her eyes then captain
goodwins face was before her separated
from her by the bars it was pale and
the perspiration stood out on his fore-
head

   little selma he muttered

   i have come to see you-yes the
president gave me a pass

  they tell me i wounded your
father

   yes

   you know i didnt mean to harm
him little selma it was the president
my bullet was for your father tried to
save the president

   i know the girl said

  he will live

   there is a chance

   and you came to see me-after i
had wounded your father

   yes

  where is frank is he with you
he is not with me  do not know
where he is but in the citv some place
i think

  captain goodwin placed his hands to
his head

   little selma he said  i believe i
have been insane i think i am insane
still i feel strangely and i must have
acted strangely but always remember
that i never meant to harm your father
 i know you did not
when the world stood still

   and now i will die like a dog i
suppose-be shot against a wall because
i tried to kill the president i didnt
know what i was doing little selma
but they wanted to stop me-just as i
was gaining victory they wanted to
end the war give the asiatics all the
glory and honor after we bad suffered
so much to win  

   youll not be shot against a wall
she whispered  the president will not
have you executed

   he told you that

   yes - he told me that put your
hand down close to mine there-take
that key now-when i stand between
you and colonel olgen unlock the door
of your cell

 what do you mean goodwin
whispered hoarsely as he took the key

   do not ask questions do just as

i	tell you are you listening

  yes-but what does it mean

   listen there is no one in this co
ridor except colonel olgen ill call
to him as you grasp my arm through the
bars and when he comes running up
burst out of your cell and seize him
you understand gag him and lock
him in the cell there is not a prisoner
nearer than ten cells of you and not one
of them can see what takes place
theyve got you at the turn in the cor-
ridor

   but why-

   dont ask questions cant you
trust me-the girl your son is going to
marry 

   i trust you little selma-of course
but-

   listen then well walk from this
prison-i have the presidents pass a
carriage is waiting it is almost day-
light well get you away quickly help
you escape and once you are free you
can send your orders to your armies and
have them strike do you understand
now  

  you are helping me to escape
goodwin asked strangely  you are
helping me so i can go on with my
work of driving the asiatics from the
earth 

  yes-yes

  but why

   cant you understand captain good-
win there are men in authority who

look at things as you do you can do
nothing while you are a prisoner and
they know it they arranged this way
of freeing you-and i got the pass from
the president because my father is his
cousin cant you see it now 

  ah you are helping me because
you love my son  

   you see now do you not   she
asked drawing back

   yes

   be quick then-do as i said

  she bent nearer the bars of his cell
suddenly one of his hands shot through
the bars and he grasped her the girl
uttered a cry of fright loud enough for
colonel olgen to hear and understand
but not loud enough to rouse the other
prisoners or the guards

  the commandant sprang forward
quickly reached the girls side at-
tempted to grasp goodwins hand in
that instant the captains hand released
its hold on the girl and was withdrawn

   come away quickly miss selester  
the commandant said   was afraid
something like this might happen you
see he is not in his right mind

  the commandant placed an arm round
the girl turned her and started away
from the cell down the corridor his
back was turned and before he had
taken three steps goodwin had thrown
open the unlocked door and had dashed
from the cell

  his hands met in a firm grip round
the commandants throat his knee was
at the commandants back and colonel
olgen went down upon the floor without
uttering a sound

   good the girl whispered  now
-into the cell with him gag him
too 

  captain goodwin knelt upon the com-
mandants chest choking the man into
insensibility finally he got upon his
feet picked up the insensible command-
ant and carried him to the cell placing
him on the floor the captain locked the
door and returned the key to the girl

   he will be insensible for several
minutes goodwin said

  she was already leading the way down
the corridor they made the turn in-
safety and presently came to the door
leading to the other corridor the girl
knocked the guard outside opened the


the all-story magazine

slot and saw her and swung open the
great door he appeared astonished to
see goodwin in place of the commandant

   where is colonel olgen  he asked

  goodwin opened his mouth to speak
but the girl was quicker

   he stopped to speak with some poor
prisoner she said  we are to go di-
rectly to the commandants office cap-
tain goodwin and i i brought a paper
from the president for captain good-
wins release

  she smiled at the soldier sweetly the
man looked at goodwin fell back a
step and saluted

   i meant no offense sir he said
it-it appeared unusual

  you but did your duty the cap-
tain replied  i shall remember you

  then he led the way down the big
corridor leaving behind him a young
soldier with visions of promotion because
of duty well performed before the chief
of staff

  they came to the office-door and cap-
tain goodwin unbolted it and threw it
open with the girl he rushed in and
closed the door behind him

  captain testnor was waiting for them

   quick  he cried  the carriage is
ready we must lose no time 

  goodwin whirled upon him

   who are you sir  he questioned

   captain testnor the austrian at-
tache sir  am acting with miss se-
lester in this matter for some others
they might have mistrusted us sir had
your son accompanied her pray lose no
time 

  he had crossed the room and thrown
open the door he led the way down
the steps running goodwin following
him the girl coming last the man on
guard outside the door was brushed to
one side like a broken toy before he
could regain his senses the carriage had
started the horses were dragging it at
a mad pace through the streets

  inside the prison the commandant
came back to life slowly when con-
sciousness returned he sat up on the floor
of the cell and tried to realize what had
happened the next instant his shriek
roused the prison and brought the guards

  explanations took but a moment as
they rushed toward the office they met
the outside sentry rushing back to them

   theyve gone - escaped   he cried
 they rushed from the inside and
hurled me off the steps before i could
get up they were gone

  how the commandant demanded
quickly

   in a carriage sir they drove down
the street

  the commandant rushed to his office
and the alarm was given

   that girl held a pass signed by the
president he said  i cannot under-
stand this business did they go to-
gether man  

   yes sir the captain was being
aided i tell you that other man-the
foreign officer - seemed to be directing
them it all happened so quickly-
yes - yes the commandant inter-
rupted  that will do to vour posts
all of you 

  they left-him and he called an offi-
cer for several moments he sat before
his desk listening to the alarm within
the prison

   a funny business he repeated
 the president shall know of it at
once

  he began writing a personal report to
the president

  and meanwhile the carriage contain-
ing captain goodwin captain testnor
and the girl drove madly through the
streets to the outskirts of the city sev-
eral times the driver changed his route

  where are we going goodwin
demanded

   to a place we have prepared sir
testnor replied  everything has been
well arranged

  the carriage drew up before an old
house set well back from the street
captain testnor got out and helped the
girl captain goodwin followed them
up the walk up the front steps to the
door testnor knocked a peculiar sig-
nal of a knock the door was opened
by a middle-aged man in civilian dress
testnor led the way into the house
without speaking to the man who opened
the door

  they entered a large room off from
the hall the lamps were burning but
opaque curtains kept the gleams from
penetrating to the darkness outside

  in the center of the room was a long
wide table and about it sat a dozen men
wallops



as the three entered these men sprang
to their feet each held a glass of
liquor in his hand iestnor guided
goodwin to the head of the table

  what have we here goodwin de-
manded

  he glanced down the table he knew
them all there was count bernstein
the german attache at washington m
elliton a french secret-service agent
captain-general torocco of spain and
the others-

  yes he knew them all there were
a couple of russians too who had been
in washington since the war began and
an italian lieutenant a mexican officer
even

  but there was not an american and
not an englishman in that room

  well what does all this mean
goodwin cried again

  he turned to look at the girl she

to be e

had stepped back and stood near the
door as though this was a scene in
which she had no part

  count bernstein the german arose
at the other end of the table he alone
of them all had retained his seat at
goodwins entrance the german held
his glass above his head and the others
did the same

    gentlemen he said  drink with
me to captain goodwin an able officer
who has been misunderstood and wronged
drink with me gentlemen to captain
goodwin who commands the armies and
navies of the united states in spite of
his personal enemies-

    not the navies laughed goodwin
 the navies as well as the armies 
bernstein cried  i call upon you gen-
tlemen to drink with me to captain
goodwin dictator of the united states
of america

wallops

 by edgar franklin

          insist on love for your
  dog as well as for yourself
  if your dog doesnt love you

outdoors in the cold world a
slow grayish drizzle was drown-
ing every chance of human
cheer it dripped drearily from
the fire-escapes up-stairs and splashed
swashily on the concrete pavement under
the back windows of the first flat it
trickled malevolently down the panes
that mother had burnished only yester-
day

  indoors in the warm smoky kitchen
ominous invisible things lurked in the
air-things more ominous than the
foggy monotone without-which robert
henry could feel yet which despite the
wisdom of his full twelve years he could
not name

   robert henrys first suspicion had been
roused when the doughnut-frying began

    	s

and robert henrys mother went to the
length of cooking three of the  holes 
for him and putting them beside him on
one of the little green-flowered plates
where he lingered over a highly uninter-
esting book

  not that robert henrys mother was
neglectful but this solicitous proceeding
on a friday afternoon argued that she
wished to be particularly motherly and
nice on sweeping day delicate little
attentions like the frying of doughnut-
holes all unrequested are rather rare
and the green plate was queer too in its
own little green way those plates
usually appeared in public only when
there was a conjunction of company and
cake

  so that robert henry munched his
doughnut-holes and pondered rather
sadly there was a nameless something
in the air and that something had a
pointed and direct reference to himself
and his personal affairs

  nor was there a doubt about the last
robert henrys mother -was smiling at


the all-story magazine

him now in a way he had not noticed
since the night the doctor said he might
be coming down with scarlet fever

  robert henrys mother was sorry for
him-and why on earth was she sorry
not because of indoor confinement in
rainy weather for robert henry had
spent many afternoons indoors without
getting that smile not because the base-
ball game to-morrow afternoon-in which
robert henry was to pitch-would have
to be postponed probably on account of
rain  for robert henrys mother had no
particular sympathy with baseball not
because-

  and just here meditation was cut
short because wallops entered

  wallops was an individuality on four
legs

  he owned a body that was either fox-
terrier bulldog irish setter scotch col-
lie dachshund pomeranian or st ber-
nard-or a composite of all he dis-
played a tail of such length that but
for a saving upward curl toward the
middle it must surely have been worn to
the bone by friction with unfeeling pave-
ments many months before wallops left
his caniie childhood behind

  as regarded countenance wallops
might have been rather pleasing to any-
one save a dog fancier his large brown
eyes were soft and friendly and seemed
to appeal for anything that might be go-
ing in the way of stray second-hand
bones

  his head had started with the inten-
tion of being broad and imposing and
then changed its mind and favored the
tapering sharp-snouted trend but for
his markings too wallops would have
been beautifully marked one eye held
a black circle one eye held a dark-brown
circle and down the long nose ran a
streak of brilliant fawn color

  but what wallops mostly held at
present was the chenille table-cover

  he held it firmly in his strong young
jaws as he looked with genial inquiry
from robert henry to his mother
robert henrys mother looked back with
a complete frigid lack of geniality

  that table-cover-the table-cover in
which wallops had already chewed three
long jagged holes-was a very nice ta-
ble-cover it had cost five dollars and
ninety-eight cent- at a very marked bar-

gain sale and in its original shape it had
been a source of justified pride to robert
henrys mother

  mrs welkins next door had paid
eleven dollars for a cover not nearly so
ornamental and when robert henrys
mother saw this particular cover dragged
through the swinging door that connect-
ed dining-room and kitchen-

  the heavy draining-spoon had missed
wallops by the merest fraction of an
inch

  the cover remained on the floor
wallops shot under the table beside
robert henry he crept straight into
the dark space beneath robert henrys
chair and crouched low as robert
henrys mother cried

   papa was quite right bobby that
dog-

  what mother asked robert
henry

   nothing put him out in the yard
bobby

   aw its all wet out there  protest-
ed robert henry

   well he can go in his house

   i know but his house leaks its all
soppy inside and-

   put that dog out 

  robert henry rose and started dis-
mally for the cellar with 

   come  wallops 

  wallops left the flat without protest
when you happen to be a dog and have
made the insane mistake of eating a che-
nille table-cover it is just as well to dis-
appear as rapidly as possible after your
mistake is confirmed

  wherefore wallops trotted dutifully
down-stairs and to the yard with robert
shuffling ahead and when they were
there robert henry pointed to the shack
constructed of aged carpet and bits of
soap-box and said sternly

   git in there you 

  wallops turned and licked his mas-
ters hand humbly and slowly and
robert henry gulped hard more and
more it was growing on him that the
mysterious something bore upon wallops
all alone out there in his leaky shed

  robert henry returned to the first
flat and thought anew the family was
sore  wallops he felt that but
what wese they going to do to wallops
what were they going-just here the
wallops



key clicked in the outer door and robert
henry turned up the light and bent over
a book

  it pleased his father to see mondays
lessons being disposed of on friday
wherefore robert henry was wholly
unaware that any one had peeked through
the curtains while he hummed monoto-
nously something about a-square plus
x-square equalling-

  possibly thirty minutes later a bass
voice called

   dinner is ready robert

  robert henry made his way to the
family board and ate dutifully of good
things-and the something remained in
the air it seemed to hover-to flit elu-
sively-to nag one from behind it
lurked over the soup it played invisibly
about the steak  it capered all unseen
about the pie and then as mother
was taking out the dishes a wildly dis-
mal howl rose from the back yard-and
the crisis swept down the stretch

   robert is that that confounded
dog demanded his father

    yes sir

   what does he want 

   i-guess he wants to come in

   let him in

  robert henry opened the window
obediently with a bound wallops ar-
rived being entirely careful to wipe his
muddy paws on the couch-cover as he
passed robert henrys father surveyed
wallops with an expression that did not
send up the smoke of burning cordiality

  wallops however looked at robert
henrys father with a with-malice-to-
ward-none expression wallops wished
to be sociable and friendly for he wagged
his tail and sniffed his teary nose as he
waited for a consoling pat the con-
soling pat did not come robert henrys
father took a last look at the canine
member of the household then

   where did you get that beast
robert

   i-found him sir

   where 

   four blocks up round the corner
   who does he belong to

   i dunno  said robert henry hotly
reverting to the primitive  there was
a kid knocking the punk outer him with
a stick an i gave him a couple o lamps
an took the dog an-

    robert 

    well i mean a big feller was lick-
ing him-he was giving him the darned-
est wallops you ever saw dad-and thats
why i named him that-and hes only
been here a week and nov he can-

   very well thats enough

  mr robert henry sr caressed his
cigar while wallops unostentatiously
removed a napkin to beneath-table spaces
and set about its careful assimilation
robert henry himself sat back and
waited he knew it was coming it
came

    robert 

    yes sir

   you are old enough now to know
that no one under the sun would wish
less to interfere with your pleasures than
i arent vou

   yes sir

   and you realize that if there was
anything i could do to forward your
pleasures id do it but this thing of
dogs-

  yes - sir said robert henry
breathlessly

    well youll have to get rid of that
puppy bob im sorry i really am
if there was any place to keep him i
wouldnt say a word said robert
henrys father  but theres not and
he seems to be raising the dickens around
the house your mother tells me youll
have to take him and lose him bob 

   but he aint got any other home 
robert henry protested desperately

   i know it possibly the expression
of robert henrys father softened a trifle
 but a flat is no place for a dog hob
and if you cant find any one that wants
him take him to the s p c a and-
and have wallops drowned 
robert henry demanded wildly

   robert henrys father avoided his eyes
and stared at the  pharaohs horses 
on the opposite wall

   i know its tough son he said
gently   was a boy myself about a
million years ago but we cant have the
pup destroying everything in the house
and- here robert henrys mother
entered  to-morrow is saturday
robert concluded his father with com-
mendable sternness  and you will have
to get rid of that dog before to-morrow
night 


the all-story magazine

  robert henry slept in the back bed-
room-the one from which when one
felt lazy one could lie in bed and watch
the breakfast preparations in the dining-
room through the connecting window

  robert henry watched no breakfast
preparations that fateful saturday morn-
ing he awakened very early indeed
wallops was wailing out a melancholy
dirge all his own out in the hut which
remained soggy despite the sunshine
and robert henry arose-in the neigh-
borhood of five-and opened the dining-
room window cautiously

  wallops entered damply and licked his
masters hands robert henry placed
wallops on the couch and wept silently
over him we would not have done it if
father and mother had been up and mo-
ving but at the moment good plain
old-fashioned grief was tearing robert
henrys young soul and he put his arms
around wallopss unlovely neck and just
cried good and hard and plenty

  and presently wallops and his mas-
ter went to sleep together on the couch

  robert-henrys father came out some-
where around seven and looked over the
combination of wet dog and goose-
fleshed pink-pajamaed boy and after
robert henrys father had covered them
with a blanket and put on the tea-kettle
he went back to the big bedroom and
said

   say-mary 

 well robert henrys mother
was fixing her hair

   couldnt the kid keep his pup

   he certainly could-if youll have
your salary raised high enough to pay
for the damage he does

   but-

   bob there is no place for that or
any other animal in this household and
you know it perfectly well i dont want
to hurt bobby but that dog is getting
to be-

  robert henrys father sighed

   all right  suppose ill have to
shoulder the authority end of it mary
hurry up im late

  breakfast

  robert henrys father finished his
two eggs and his two pieces of toast and
his cup of coffee then he turned to
robert henry with

   you remember what i said about
that dog last night bobby 

   yes sir

   dont forget it during the day

   no sir

  robert henry swallowed aloud wal-
lops absent-mindedly removed the cover
of the couch and then sat up to beg for
a piece of robert henrys bacon he
received robert henrys entire allotment
in one handful-and strangely neither
parent saw the proceeding quite intent-
ly they were studying the two sections
of the morning paper

  wallops looked round thoughtfully
when the bacon was gone he walked
up to the side of robert henrys father
and insinuated his nose under one hand
robert henrys father scratched an ear
almost affectionately and gave a side-
long glance at the unhappy animal

  the animal looked up and emitted a
queer little sound of appreciation-and
robert henrys father rose suddenly

   twenty minutes after eight  he an-
nounced crisply  ill have to hurry
his coat and hat were on the chair
he slipped into them with more than
usual speed and straightened up where-
upon robert henrys mother said inju-
diciously 

   go to the door with dad bobby
robert went so did wallops trail-
ing behind cheerfully robert henry
went also to the extreme length of slip-
ping one small boy hand into his fathers
and squeezing tight and when they came
to the door at the end of the private
hall robert henry mumbled

   hey pop  

   what is it sonny 

   doncher think i could-maybe if i
teased mother-keep the pup dad i
can fix him up a new house and keep
him in the yard an-

   well darn it i dont see why you
cant- and robert henrys father
straightened up abruptly  never use
language like that robert  he said
sternly  im-im late and-er-
nervous and-you do just what mother
says robert and-good-by 

  he shot into the outer hall and

   papa  went after him desperately
 and heres ten cents catch  said
the parent as lie sent the coin spinning
through the air and fled
wallops



  robert henry returned to the dining-
room and sat down and wallops climbed
more or less gracefully on his lap

   mother said robert henry

    well  

   do-do i have to get rid of wal-
lops

   yes said his mother  and if you
want to play in that ball game the
sooner you start the better

  wallops took the push as a hint and
dropped to the floor with a heavy thud
robert henry shuffled into his room and
found his cap it hung on his right ear
now and robert henrys shoulders
rounded somewhat and his hands went
into his pockets robert henry felt that
he was growing incensed at his mother
and that policy dictated a quick exit

  mon wallops he said and he
added inaudibly by mother

  when are you coming home
dearie followed him yp the private
hall

   dunno  said robert henry sav-
agely as the door slammed behind him

  robert henrys mother watched him
from the shelter of the lace curtains in
the parlor-window robert henry was
standing on the curb studying a silver
dime intently while wallops stood on
his hind feet and braced his forepaws
against robert henry wagging his tail
furiously in a frantic effort to see what
the hand contained

  robert henrys mother said hang
the old curtains and things im go-
ing- which was not at all ladylike
then she raised a double knuckle to rap
on the window and recall robert henry
then she sighed and her hand fell
when you buy six-dollar table-covers
out of a twenty-eight-dollar salary they
are too expensive to be served as puppy-
cakes

  first there was the grocer on the cor-
ner

  any really good up-to-date grocer
needs a dog  a dog is an ornament to
a grocery-store he makes friends he
stimulates trade and awakens lasting in-
terest among the customers but this
was no up-to-date grocer this was a
plain cheap man who laughed outright
at the offer of wallops threw him a dis-
eased ham-end and wanted to know what

robert henrys mama wanted for the
sunday order-and please hurry becausc
there were three ladies waiting

  robert henry stalked out with wal-
lops the to-be-lost trotting inquiringly
at his heels next a butcher wont
have a dog all the things that might
interest a dog are sold at so much a bar-
rel when the man comes around each
week and again-next well there
was the lady that had the fancy-store
any little notion-store must need a dog
for protection robert henry entered
with confidence begotten of many months
of trade in the way of thread and elastics
and so on

  wallops broke the possibly celestial
combination by chasing the store cat up
the hot stove-pipe as a side issue he
overturned a large pasteboard box of
baby ribbon in his flight

  when robert henry quite regained
his breath they were on the street and
the door had been slammed behind them
and wallops was barking furiously
through the glass

    well well beat it for a new neigh-
borhood   said robert henry fiercely
 well get you a home or-or well go
out west together or-or something
come on

  wallops followed reluctantly they
went up the avenue now lingeringly
they came to the little park where wild
young children and tame old men were
wont to disport themselves on sunny
days they spent a good two hours
there while robert henry wandered
back and forth and talked to the elder
members of the company none of them
wanted a really good dog none of them
indeed wanted a dog of any kind at any
price-and the noon whistle blew and
robert henry and wallops were still to-
gether and roaming the avenue again

  twelve-and the game was called at
two well the game could go plumb
to blazes  wallops was whining in his
own sweet peculiar way-the way which
meant that the wallopian internal econ-
omy was approaching a vacuum wal-
lops had to be fed first and homed after-
ward  and robert henry walked into
a delicatessen-shop and demanded the
maximum of bologna procurable for ten
cents it was ample it was sliced
thin it was done up in nice waxed


the all-story magazine

paper and handed over the counter with
the smile that is likely to greet the first
visit of a strange little boy in the neigh-
borhood it was even accompanied by
the gift of several pffernussen

  then robert henry gave the delica-
tessen gentleman food for meditation by
sitting down on the curb and opening the
dainty package while wallops settled
hungrily beside him-

   you gotter have your lunch mutty
choked robert henry as he passed an
arm about the four-legged member  i
can git my dinner home t-night but
you-

  he fed forth the slices wallops
disposed of them and expressed grati-
tude by divers greasy licks upon the
cheeks a matter of three minutes and
lunch was over and robert henry was
rising stiffly while wallops licked his
own chops

  now robert henry shuffled on-
and on-and on and at last they came
to engine-house eighty-seven there
was the engine harness and all visible
through the open doors there was
a man sitting at a desk while little bells
above him tinkled thrillingly robert
henry dived desperately under the heavy
chain at the door and wallops followed
the blue-uniformed man looked up with
astonishment as robert henry cried
hev does this company want a
dog

   do we-what 

  wallops filled the gap neatly he

rose  his hind legs and deftly removed
the half-eaten sandwich from the desk
and in the course of some two or three
seconds the blue-uniformed man leaned
back and roared heartily

 is he trained to do that he asked
 he aint trained for anything said
robert henry earnestly  but hes the
best dog and the smartest dog you
ever-

  at this point a man in somewhat im-
posing uniform came down-stairs vio-
lating all traditions of the brass pole
the man was yawning the person at
the desk grinned and asked

   do we want a new dog chief

   huh

   sallie died  last week you know
and this kid-

  hey chief said robert henry

soaring to the heights of the palpitating
emergency  this dogs mine an
-mother wont let me keep him he
aint got no home  gotter find him a
home i asked this gent-

  wallops detected a trace of butter on
the chiefs thumb and licked it away con-
scientiously meanwhile giving his nicest
little whine of thanks the chief stared
at him and by the grave of heaven -
laughed

   well give him a home- son  he
said

   and can i come and see him some-
times 

   surest thing you know kid  
whereupon there was a peal from the
big gong over the desk and a district
call began horses stamped from their
stalls men came down the poles there
was a hiss of steam and a clatter of
wheels and

   you git outer the way kid  yelled
the imposing man as he climbed into his
little buggy

  robert henry made the sad break of
returning too early from sunday-school
the man up-stairs heard him when he
rang and lie listened for robert henry
had confided some of his soul-soreness
to the man up-stairs last night on the
stoop

  can i stay out a while mother
robert henry inquired

   if you do not leave the steps

   aright robert henry turned
away

  have you been to sunday-school
   mmmm

   did you put your five cents in the
box

   mmmm

   does that mean yes or no 

   well i-didnt  rebellion rose
to the surface albeit robert henry
stared at the carpet

   why not   the tone turned harsh
what did you do with it
candy said robert henry

   that nickel was given you to give
to god robert his mother replied
quietly  that five cents-

   aw-say i was hungry an god
wasnt  returned wallopss late owner
as he headed for the open air

  possibly the ill-judged laugh of
wallops



robert henrys father caused the door
to close suddenly atall events robert
henry reached the steps without further
interference and sat down

  he stood up again as quickly for
down the street the clanging of bells
was raising the echoes and the shouts of
people and the galloping of hoofs and
the policeman on the corner was waving
back the cars-and a dog was barking
wildly and robert henry knew that
bark as well as he knew his own name

  the engine and the wagon and the
chiefs buggy took the tracks and roared
and clamored on toward robert henrys
house in wild procession up up the
engine horses a long-tailed dog all but
somersaulted in his frenzy as he raced
and barked beside the team

  it was wallops fast enough and he
was coining straight for his late master-
and his back was turned squarely toward
robert henry and his house and-

  wallops cried robert henry

  the bell clanged the whistle blew
the horses hammered on-and wallops
barked and turned never one glance
toward his late home

  wallops roared robert henry

  the near horse turned for a second

and gave a friendly bite in wallopss di-
rection  and wallops shrieked out glee-
ful barks as he careered through the air

   wallops  screamed robert henry
the window behind robert henry
opened and his mothers voice said-quite
plainly above the din

   you must not run to fires on sunday
robert remember that 

  as the man up-staireappeared in his
shirt-sleeves robert henrys eyes were
glued to the quickly departing figure of
the forgetful the faithless one it was
all over in one brief twenty-four hours

  forgotten was the wasted wealth of
affection and the stolen bones and the
carpet shed and all the rest it had been
the very best thing robert henry could
do for wallopss comfort - and it was
forgotten forgotten too was the aged
blanket forgotten was the twenty-five-
cent collar with the big studs which had
left just three cents in the tin bank

  wallops was a fire-dog now he had
no further use for robert henry wal-
lops had forgotten and-

  hey wheres my algebra moth-
er muttered robert henry as he

stumbled into the flat
run to any fires

 i aint going to

name of wainwright has been at the hotel that spring

chapter vii continued

found

this blank crushing disappoint-
ment struck us almost dumb i
did not know what to make of
it we recovered sufficiently to
insist on the presence of our friends in
the hotel

  we changed from english to french
to avoid any mistake of mispronuncia-
tion and indeed we pronounced the
name of our friends in every manner in
which it could possibly be distorted by
a french tongue

  it was no use they had apparently
never heard the name and so far as
i knew there was no other grand hotel
in paris

   that cablegram must have been a
mere blind count courvoie is some-
how at the bottom of this  carr ex-
claimed aside to me

  strangely enough i had scarcely
thought of the apache count since i had
sailed carrs remark seemed suddenly to
illumine the whole affair and to bring the
count to my mind

   by thunder you may be right
theres a deeper mystery here than weve
suspected i exclaimed wed better

 began july a   - s t o r y mae

get a room here though while we look
round

   so we wrote our names in the register
and were at once assigned to rooms on
the next floor

  ah m villiams - of new york
said the clerk scrutinizing my name
 you are expected there is a lady
here who wishes to see you as soon as
you arrive

  whats her name i demanded
startled at this development

   mme henry

   i did not know it but i requested to

be shown to the ladys presence instant-
ly and carr went with me a valet de
chambre took us up-stairs along a cor-
ridor and knocked at a door i hardly
know now whom i expected to see for
my mind was full of count courvoie at
the moment but the door suddenly
opened and there before us stood laura
wainwright

  mr williams-mr carr - you
too  she exclaimed and faltered turn-
ing pale

  we stepped quickly inside the room
and shutting the door carefully behind
us turned to her

   i cant tell you how glad i am-
she began tremulously hesitated choked

 a z i n e  single copies  cents

and then flung herself on my neck in
tempest of sobbing

uncle bob oh uncle bob s
moaned

chapter viii

fi l-de-fer

  i patted her shoulder gently and
tried to soothe her

   there there child i said  cry
if you want to its all right now
youve been having an awful time
havent you but were here to stand
by you now carr please get her a glass
of water or something

  as i talked i was full of the wildest
curiosity as to what had happened but
laura was in no condition to be ques-
tioned just then but at last she
stopped sobbing fairly exhausted and
released herself from my arms with her
face flushed and swollen and her mouth
still trembling

  carr who had been rushing about
and glaring at me in agitation and
jealousy brought her something to
drink and she regained some degree of
self-control

   its like heaven to see you she said
 ive been through - more than i can
tell you papa is gone im terribly
afraid something has happened to him

   gone-and left you alone where  
carr cried

   hes been gone a long time-more
than a week i dont know where i
dont know what would have become of
me if you hadnt come

why didnt you cable sooner why
didnt you cable me carr demanded
 i couldnt remember your address
carr glanced at me with triumph

   besides she added  mr williams
knows all about paris and hes my old-
est friend

   can you tell us all about it-how
you came to paris and about your
fathers disappearance carr asked

   not now i interposed seeing a
look of horror cross her face again
 well hear that presently just now
laura will send for tea and we will
have a rest and a quiet chat

  we had the tea and we had the quiet
chat broken by long abstracted silences

a as the mystery thrust its dark face into
   our consciousness but laura became by
   degrees more like her usual self

     the evening had grown dark when at
  last i got the whole story from her by
  gentle questioning

   it was simple enough after leaving
new york with her father on their way
to old point wainwright had insisted
 their leaving the train at philadel-
phia it was then almost midnight
they spent the rest of the night at a
hotel and next morning they went on
board a transatlantic steamer wheretheir
passages had been already booked under
the names of  mr and miss henry
 at first i was astonished and almost
frightened said laura  but papa ex-
plained that he was obliged to make a
short trip to paris at once and that
there were important business reasons
why no one should know that he had
gone he had not even told me in ad-
vance for greater secrecy and he was
sailing by this obscure toute so as not
to be recognized

    it was a freight steamer in fact and
there were only two passengers besides
ourselves all through the voyage papa
seemed greatly disturbed about some-
thing though he never mentioned any
especial trouble

    we reached paris and came to this
hotel still under the name of  henry
nothing in particular happened for a
couple of weeks and i thought papa
seemed a little less worried then one
afternoon eight days ago he went out
alone and did not come back for dinner

    i waited for him all the evening
he did not come you can imagine the
night i spent said laura with a shud-
der  since then nothing has been
heard of him i dont-

    of course you have notified the po-
lice i interrupted

    count courvoie has attended to all
that for me he has set detectives at
work and-

  has that fellow been to see you
exclaimed carr

   he came to call on us as soon as
we arrived he was the only person
whom papa had told we were here i
believe he has been very kind to me
do you like him laura i in-
quired


the all-story magazine

    i hate him  laura admitted  its
a shame for he has been the only friend
i had here but somehow it frightens
me to have him come near me

   your instinct may be right i said
gravely  you have other friends now
and you wont need courvoie when he
calls next send him to me i want to
see him

   but what can have become of
papa laura cried recurring to the
vital topic

   i dont know but well find out
never fear  said  do you know if
he had anv money on him when he went
out

   he had the letter of credit it was
for several thousand dollars probably
he had currency as well he had left
scarcely any with me and i have been in
terror that it would be exhausted and
that id be turned out of the hotel

   we can find out whether the letter
has been drawn on since he left you

i was saying when some one tapped at
the door

  it was a servant with a card for
laura

    count courvoie is down-stairs wait-
ing to see me she said quickly turning
to us

  send him away exclaimed carr
impatiently

    tell monsieur le comte that i am not
well that i cannot receive- laura was
saying to the servant in french when
the mustache and white shirt-front of
the count himself appeared in the door
he had followed his card up without
waiting

   i am so sorry to hear it madem-
oiselle he said bowing and he looked
past her into the room as his eyes fell
upon carr and me i felt suddenly cer-
tain that he had somehow been notified
of our arrival and had hastened here to
be on the spot

  mr carr and mr williams he
exclaimed  another cha-rming sur-
prise  really might almost fancy my-
self in new york

  neither of us returned his bow and
i remarked pointedly hardly if it
were new york we wouldnt meet you

  then i am glad its paris the
count smiled blandly

   we were about to go miss wain-

wright is not well and wishes to be
alone i said taking up my hat and
carr and  moved toward the door

  courvoie was fairly outmaneuvercd
 i will take my leave also then he
murmured   shall hope to hear bet-
ter news to-morrow then with a
glance at me i will walk a little way
with you if you will permit me

  i was very willing to permit him  in
fact i was going to propose it myself

i dropped a word to laura under my
breath and we three went down-stairs

  once on the soft glitter and the gay
hum of the boulevard the count stepped
to the curb glanced up the street and
seemed to signal i looked too but saw
nothing more than a closed cab that
crawled after us as we began to walk
slowly along the sidewalk

  i was planning what to say when the
count took the wind out of my sails

   now williams he said crisply
 tell me-what have you done with the
american

  with wainwright i gasped
 great heavens what have you done
with him yourself for im morally
certain that youre at the bottom of all
this

   i declare on my word that i know
absolutely nothing of what has become
of him protested courvoie  ive had
men searching for him for a week
norn de dieu its more important to me
than to any one else that he should be
found

  why carr demanded

   well as his future son-in-law-

    you liar  carr burst out
fil-de-fer started flushed and
glanced over his shoulder quickly

   thats not a word to use among gen-
tlemen he observed

   no but its a good word to use to
you   carr boiled

   hold on lets not quarrel i in-
terposed  we wont discuss the mar-
riage question the important thing
first is to find what has become of mr
wainwright

    i tell you i know nothing about it
the count repeated and turned off to go
down a little street that stretched away
into dim down-hill regions to the left

   no keep to the boulevard i said
with a sudden premonition
prince of apaches



   we would be quieter this way
courvoie urged

   but perhaps not so peaceful i said
taking him firmly by the arm and turn-
ing him back

  the crawling cab had come up close
behind us and as i glanced at it i saw
at least three faces peering through the
glass its interior must have been
packed with men

  the faces disappeared instantly but
a cold thrill shot down my backbone
now i was certain that fil-de-fer had
been forewarned of our coming to the
grand hotel

   i think in fact that mr carr and
i will leave you here  went on
 you mustnt follow us and listen
count courvoie  i said imperatively
 you must in future make no attempt
to see miss wainwright we have come
all the way from new york to pro-
tect her and well do it

  we left him planted on the sidewalk
looking cold steel at us both no doubt
he would have liked to call up his ear-
riageload of ruffians but the crowded
boulevard was not the place and look-
ing warily over my shoulder i presently
saw him get into the cab and drive off

  i instantly stopped another cab that
happened to be passing

   go back to the hotel i said to carr
 ill be along in an hour i must find
out where hes going and to the dri-
ver double fare if you dont lose
sight of that cab

chapter ix

the latin quarter

  ir is not so easy to follow a cab
through crowded streets however and
especially in the evening we kept it
in sight down to the blaze of the place
de opera up the rue scribe and then
straight along the rue lafayette north-
eastward

it was clear to me where fil-de-fer

and his gang were going they were
heading for montmartre and the north-
ern barrihe the heights of the city by
the fortifications where criminal paris
lias its headquarters

  we kept them in sight to the boule-
vard clichy the tenderloin of paris

lying like a terrace on the side of the
steep montmartre slope near the cha-
teau rouge we became involved in a jam
of cabs and automobiles and when we
had got clear the counts cab was out of
sight

  i was angry and disappointed but it
was not the fault of my driver we
roamed about at random for a time and
then realizing that there was no use in
going farther i ordered him to take us
back to the grand hotel at any rate
i had learned the region that the enemy
frequented

  another surprise met me as i entered
the hotel just inside the reading-room
keeping a sharp unobtrusive eye on
every one who entered sat a man i knew
well

  it was a detective from my old office
the manhattan bureau and it flashed
upon me that he was no doubt employed
in the search for wainwright

  i thought he passed an imperceptible
wink to me as he saw me but he made
no open recognition and i did not speak
but went straight up-stairs to lauras
room

  carr was there and they were con-
versing so eagerly that they hardly heard
my knock iaura seemed wonderfully
brighter carr had succeeded in cheer-
ing her up i thought with perhaps a
little ungenerous jealousy but it was
not a moment for sentiment

   the first thing is to get right out
of this hotel i said  and into some
quiet spot the more obscure the better
where no one will think of looking for
us monsieur le comte means mischief

  and i told briefly what had happened
for carr had not seen the menace of the
crowded cab

   it cant be the count who has taken
papa away  cried laura  i never
dreamed of such a thing-it cant be

  there was silence

   im afraid its quite possible i
said  though to be sure i dont see
how he could profit in any way by get-
ting your father out of sight a few
days however ought to make it clear
one thing im certain ofthat harry
wainwright is alive and well and in
paris though why hes lying low in this
way i cant imagine

  i was rewarded by lauras grateful


the all-story magazine

look but  spoke with more confidence
than i really felt

  in my heart i believed either that fil-
le-fer had kidnaped the millionaire and
was keeping him imprisoned for reasons
of his own or else that wainwrights
mind had somehow become unhinged
and he had wandered off into some per-
haps fatal misadventure

  but i said nothing of this we spent
the rest of the evening in packing i
paid the bills and next morning at six
oclock-the best hour for escaping pos-
sible spying-we drove away from the
hotel with one of lauras trunks on the
top of our cab

  the rest of her baggage i ordered
sent to a storage warehouse for the pres-
ent and carrs trunk and mine were still
at the railway station

  we crossed the river to the latin
quarter and we had to drive about for
an hour or two before it was late enough
to look for lodgings finally we found
a sufficiently quiet clean and obscure
refuge in a students hotel-the hotel
dostende on the rue bonaparte just
below the luxembourg gardens

  the hotel which would have been
called a  furnished - room house  in
new york contained no more than a
dozen lodgers and wras managed by a
withered but spry old lady of nearly sev-
enty with the assistance of her huge
black-bearded son as valet de chambre

  all day long this indefatigable mme
lagache swept mopped scrubbed and
dusted followed obediently by her big
son who had spent two years in a cavalry
regiment in tunis and now emptied
slops and made beds with a simple nat-
uralness that dignified his office

  laura took to them at once and i
hoped that this was a spot where we
could remain concealed and quiet as long
as we chose

  prices have risen in-the latin quar-
ter and the place has lost the desperately
spectacular bohemia that probably it
never had except in books the more
impecunious students and artists have
moved to montmartre and there is al-
most village quiet on the little crooked
clean streets of the left bank

   we installed laura in a room on the
top floor and carr and i took the apart-
ment directly beneath her a heavy tip

to the concicrge impressed upon her that
no one was to go up to see mile henry
without first sending up his name laura
was to have her meals brought in from a
restaurant across the street in fact she
was to live almost as a prisoner till we
obtained further light on the dangers
that might be threatening us for the
present i was determined to take no
chances

  we were no sooner settled than i hur-
ried across the river again to the banking
house on which wainwrights letter of
credit had been drawn disappointment
was the result for i learned that the let-
ter had not yet been presented at all

  clearly wainwright must have brought
a sufficient sum in cash from america to
last him for some time but by now it
would surely have been exhausted he
would almost certainly have drawn on
his credit if he were alive and at liberty

  yet if he were alive and at liberty
what possible reason could he have for
thus concealing himself

  i went back to the latin quarter puz-
zling over this problem trying somehow
to connect it with courvoie and not quite
succeeding then in the very doorway
of the hotel dostende i espied miller
the american detectivc whom i had seen
at the grand hotel the sight gave me
a sudden queer uneasiness

  i walked straight up to him this time

   business or pleasure miller i de-
manded

   well either he answered with a
shrewd humorous side-glance  i want-
ed to see you williams thought you
might perhaps call at the office to see
the boys again

   perhaps t may but what did you
want to see me for  

   look here youre in the profes-
sion or used to be can i talk to you
on the square 

  i hesitated and my conscience pricked
me

   yes  said with a mental reserva-
tion

   im looking for wain wright the
new york insurance man you know
him dont you 

   i understood that hed disappeared
in america i heard of it before i
sailedt remarked

   now youre not talking on the level
prince of apaches



williams miller reproached me you
neednt try to bluff wainwright was
spotted here two weeks ago he was
at the grand hotel with his daughter
under an assumed name yesterday you
and your friend came here with miss
wainwright and ive every reason to
suppose that you either have him here
too or that you know where he is

   i was astonished at so much accurate
information

    you fellows have grown clever since
 left i remarked  but i assure you
that i havent the slightest idea where
the man is i believe hes been mur-
dered why should i want to hide him
or why should his daughter want to-or
for that matter why should he want to
hide himself 

   well  dont know theres pos-
sibly a reason said miller  you
know-

    but arent you working on his daugh-
ters behalf arent you trying to find
him  i demanded

    why im trying to serve a subpoena
on him you know miller explained
 summons to testify before the insur-
ance committee in new york on the
business of his company thats what
i thought he might be trying to dodge
 by jove  i exclaimed and a whole
new avenue of possibilities opened sud-
denly before me

   i had totally forgotten the insurance
investigation

    all the same i dont know anything
about him i said  you can go back
and tell the chief that from me

    ill tell him all right but i dont
think hell be satisfied returned miller
with a grin as he walked off

   but i stood on the sidewalk for a long
time gazing across at the green tree-tops
of the luxembourg and thinking hard
before i went up-stairs at last to meet
laura

chapter x

  montmartre after midnight

   laura refused to believe that her fa-
ther could be hiding for any business
reasons and carr ridiculed the idea
but  was not convinced certainly
there was no question of wainwrights

personal integrity yet i thought that
possibly there might be secrets in the ad-
ministration of the madison life which
he would rather not have made public
but i should have credited him with
more common sense than to take this
silly and useless method of concealment

   however if he were really lying low
i felt certain that he would be in one of
the american or english pensions that
swarm in the west end of paris near the
bois de boulogne for wainwright
spoke little or no french and in spite
of a dozen visits knew practically noth-
ing of the city

  there was a chance i thought and
i persuaded carr to spend a couple of
days with me in investigating it i
found that he knew paris like a book-
or part of it at least he had acquired
the knowledge expensively in his gilded
days when he had also learned to speak
french as well as i did

   at one of the tourist agcncies we pro-
cured a list -of english-speaking board-
ing-houses and proceeded to visit them
one by one there was an incredible
number of them  our two days extended
to nearly a week but when we had fin-
ished with them we had had our labor for
our pains and the daily disappointment
had worn poor laura almost into nervous
prostration

  my suspicions turned again toward
courvoie as the holder of the secret we
had seen and heard nothing of him since
leaving the grand hotel and now i
regretted more than ever that i had
failed that day to track him down to the
place he had come from

  in the bottin-the city directory-
his address was given as the cercle de
russie a club which i knew to be like
many of the paris clubs simply a gam-
bling association it was impossible that
he lived there the great family mansion
the old hotel courvoie in the impasse
st francis had been sold two genera-
tions ago and just where the last dimin-
ished head of the family was laid i did
not know

   i had a shrewd suspicion however and
next evening i turned to the heights of
montmartre where impecunious artistic
criminal and adventurous paris seethes
together in the narrow up-and-down
streets and steps of the old suburb


the all-story magazine

  it was nearly midnight when i left
my cab and walked along the boulevard
clidiy for i knew that courvoie and
his associates were night-birds and there
would be no use in going earlier into
their haunts

  the tenderloin of paris had not
changed much in five years i thought as
 strolled warily along the showy boule-
vard on every side flared the more or
less sensational resorts designed to give
the tourist a glimpse of the real parisian
wickedness that he expects

  the moulin rouge revolved its red
arms slowly above the sidewalk the rat
mort the grande truanderie the cafes
of death heaven and hell advertised
their perfunctory outrageousness to the
street crowded with revelers tourists
overdressed women aild quiet thin-faced
men with svage restless eyes these last
 knew and kept clear of they were the
wolves of the street the paris apaches
perhaps members of fil-de-fers gang

  i prowled about the district in a
desultory way that night from the forti-
fications almost to the buttes peeping
into cafes scrutinizing street groups
hoping that i might pick up something
useful by a lucky chance i did not find
anything of the sort but the night
brought me a stfsnge meeting which was
to bear fruit later

  i was climbing the long flight of steps
that leads to the plateau of the saere
cceur and was half-way up when  no-
ticed a man coming down from the top
he stopped a couple of steps above me

   will monsieur tell me the time  he
requested

  i examined him swiftly noted the
cheap swagger of his bearing and also
that one hand was clenched in his pocket

   time to be off i replied showing
just the shining muzzle of my six-
shooter

   parfaitement monsieur laughed the
rodeur with easy assurance and stood
aside to let me pass i went wide keep-
ing my eye on him and caught a better
glimpse of his face

   rochet  i cried

  the fellows face quickened he
stared hesitated and almost gasped

   m williams he ejaculated ah
ere nom quelle chance and id
have had my knife into you-

   i dare say i said  but what have
you been doing how do you come to be
an apache

  six or  eight years before emile
rochet had been a most useful assistant
to me in my work in paris he was a
youngster of fourteen then sharp with
the prenatural keenness of the streets
where he had been born and bred

  i knew enough about him to have him
clapped into prison several times over
and this fact perhaps strengthened his
loyalty but he liked me i believe and
professed to be inconsolable when i
sailed for america

   had made some provision for him
to keep him out of the gutter and now
here he was with a knife in his pocket
his face already seared and scorched
with alcohol and crime prowling over
midnight montmartre in search of prey
but he seemed genuinely affected at the
meeting

   you should have stayed monsieur
he said  after you went they wouldnt
use me at the american detective office
then  had a little difficulty with the
police and so now -he shrugged his
shoulders with a certain pride- now i
steal i rob

   do you kill too

  monsieur doesnt think me afraid of
a little red

   i think youre likely to claim rela-
tionship with sister guillotine i said
 would you like to work for me again
at the old terms i think i can use you
 id ask nothing better he said
eagerly

   good to begin with do you know
the count courvoie

   connais pas he shook his head
 the aristocracy are not intimate with
me

   fil-de-fer i corrected

  the apache brightened up
fil-de-fer do i know him i
should think so that is i know him
by sight hes an aristocrat sure
enough a lord of montmartre prince of
the apaches hes not afraid of the po-
lice and he has a dozen of the worst ruf-
fians in paris at the crook of his finger
youre not one of them i inter-
rupted his enthusiasm

   no monsieur i am not sufficiently
advanced he confessed
prince of apaches



    well this is very interesting i said
 where does fil-de-fer and his gang
have their headquarters 

   i dont know but i can find out

   good find out then and meet me
to-morrow night at this same spot now
go and remember that its not safe to
play any tricks with me youve become
so good an apache that i dont trust
you

  ihe fellow went down the steps and
turned into the black mouth of the
rue gabrielle without looking back
after some reflection i turned back to
the boulevard my new all born and
bred in the depths of paris would find
out what i wanted and there was no
use at present in exposing my life fur-
ther

    diil not say much to laura or to carr
about my adventures the result was too
uncertain and i did not want to raise
their hopes i merely said that i was
exploring montmartre in the hope of
finding a clue and that i thought i was
on the trail

  i was disappointed for next evening
rochet failed to appear i waited bang-
ing about the stairs for nearly an hour
and finally gave him up and went back
to explorations of my own again
rochet failed me on the following night
and i planned grimly to get even with
the traitor as i prowled about the slums
like a bird of prey

  i saw terrible things in those two
nights and ran terrible risks though i
was dressed with careful shabbiness of
effect and carried a revolver in my coat-
pocket and a heavy loaded cane in my
hand  i came home once to find my boots
soaked with blood from a dark puddle
that i had stepped into unsuspectingly

  once a man in evening clothes reeled
out of a dark alley and tumbled at my
feet with the life pouring out from a
dozen knife-cuts i saw men-and wom-
en too-held up robbed and beaten in
dark squares by gangs of hoodlums and
dared not interfere and which was
pleasanter i saw knives and pistols
drawn in street feuds where the wolves
of the street took sides and turned against
one another

  for this is the quarter of the mur-
derers the rodeurs the apaches who
kill as often as not for the sheer pleasure

of killing like the weasel they are a
development of the last thirty years and
it is chiefly absinthe that is responsible
for their criminal insanity more terrible
than anything known in saner america

  by day and in the early evening these
streets clean as even a paris slum is al-
ways clean wear a pleasantly quiet and
suburban air but the wild beasts awake
with midnight shadowy skulking forms
haunt the darker streets the dance-halls
of the barriere fill arid the cabarets and
drinking-houses where a stranger would
risk his life by showing a nickel watch

  the police seem quite unable to han-
dle the situation and will also be so until
they carry revolvers instead of their use-
less short swords

  i ran risks but i came through them
safely thanks to a perfect knowledge of
french slang a little audacity and a
great deal of caution but i saw no
more of emile rochet until the third eve-
ning

  i was walking slowly along the
boulevard clichy near the place
blanche when a man jostled sharply
against me in the throng as i turned
angrily to look at him i saw that it was
my unreliable assistant and he gave me
a glance that checked the words  my
lips

   look out for yourself  he mut-
tered  two of fil-de-fers gang are
following you

  and he was gone

chapter xi

a meeting in hades

  i walked on a little way stopped to
look in a shop window and glanced cau-
tiously back i could not at once make
out any one who looked as if he might be
shadowing me in the crowd of boule-
vardiers that filled the sidewalk but pres-
ently a couple of men came in sight-
sharp-featured pale shifty-looking like
true sons of the gaslight and passed me
without a glance

  whether of fif-de-fers gang or not
they were of the true apache type but
they appeared to be following not me
but some one else

  i walked slowly after them a few
yards farther and i caught sight of a man


the all-story magazine

standing at the edge of the sidewalk he
was looking the other way but there was
something about his back that i seemed
to recognize

  i started toward him with a suddenly
beating heart forgetting the  shadow-
ers it was an old man with a shock of
white hair and as he began to walk away
he seemed to move unsteadily as if either
intoxicated or utterly exhausted then
he looked suddenly over his shoulder and
i almost shouted his name

  for it was wainwright-wainwright
himself on the streets of the paris ten-
derloin

  the face that he had turned toward
me was haggard and hunted and as
pitiable as any human face i ever saw

  i started to push toward him and
found the two apaches at my elbow
they were looking at me now with both
surprise and interest and i was struck
all at once with the certainty that i had
seen at least one of their faces before-
through the glass window of a closed cab

  the recognition filled my mind for an
instant and when i glanced ahead again
the figure of wainwright had disap-
peared

  i ran after him elbowing my way
through the crowd but i could not find
him we were in front of the cafe
de lenfer where a rather tame repre-
sentation of future punishment is given
to shock the sensation-seeking tourist but
 could not think that he had entered the
place

  i saw the pair of apachcs go in how-
ever and after another anxious glance
up and down the street i took the chance
of following them

  it was a long low narrow hall dimly
lighted with glass-topped tables illu-
mined by a fiery glow from beneath
pasteboard serpents decorated the ceil-
ing  a man in a dress-suit banged a piano
in a crimson caldron

  satan himself in the conventional
scarlet and cocks feather waved me to
a seat and an attendant imp hovered
round for my order

  instead of sitting down i looked round
and drew a sigh of relief to see that i
had been right for there sat the man
i was looking for his elbows  the lurid
table and his head in his hands in an
attitude of total prostration

  he paid no attention to the glass of
beer beside him the two roughs had
sat down on the opposite side of the same
table but he failed to notice them

  the apaches transferred their attention
to me as i sat down at the nearest possi-
ble table and there was suspicion hos-
tility if not menace in their faces i was
sure that they had recognized me and
were going to stand between me and their
victim-if he were their victim

   bring me a bock i said impatiently
to the satanic waiter who hovered at my
shoulder

  one pot of molten brimstone of the
hottest  he sang out to the bar and
mephistopheles emitted a rattling laugh

  it was wainwright there was no
doubt of it and i wondered what terrible
history his presence implied had cour-
voie been keeping him prisoner-had he
escaped and was about to be recaptured
-or had these thugs simply marked him
as a likely object of robbery

  i could not guess but evil was pre-
paring for him and i rejoiced that i had
come up before the crisis

  i tried to catch his eye but he would
not look up i was afraid to go to him
directly the apaches were regarding
me more and more threateningly and 
saw that i had committed a fatal error
in making myself so conspicuous i
could do nothing unless i could get out
of their watchfulness and i got up in-
tending to go out and wait for wain-
wright on the sidewalk

  but before i reached the door one of
the men rose to follow me and at this
open declaration of war i turned back
and sat down again

  a nervous five minutes passed the
piano clanged the demons laughed and
shrieked papier - mac he snakes were
swung down from the ceiling while the
apaches watched me without moving
and i watched wainwright who kept his
head in his hands i fancied that he
had gone to sleep

   a la chaudicre  shouted satan and
the customers arose and filed obediently
toward the  hot room but wain-
wright kept his seat and the two men
stayed with him

  i followed the crowd gladly however
seeing a chance of slipping quietly out

  the chaudicre was an inner chamber
prince of apaches	

decorated to resemble a grotto and i
was disappointed to find that it had no
street door on a small stage at the
farther end a crimson-clad devil was
giving an exhibition of contortions and
afterward a presumably wicked individual
was shown burning at the stake after
the flames had flared up so as to conceal
his body completely they gradually sank
and a skeleton was seen hanging in the
chains

  i had seen the same thing before on
the new york vaudeville stage and when
volunteers were called for to be burned
alive i accepted with alacrity

  they clasped the chain round my waist
and the puffs of steam illuminated by
rays from a lantern began to rise round
my legs when these mock flames had
enshrouded me safely an arm deftly un-
hooked the chain and i was pulled aside
and lehind a curtain

   i have saved you from your well-
merited punishment said the demon
sepulchrally it is worth-

   a franc i replied  and a half
louis if you get me out of here without
passing through the cafe

  the devil winked and nodded with a
very human interest hustled me back
through a storeroom a passage and into
a narrow courtyard here lie opened a
door and  was in the blaze of the street

  i walked round to the entrance and
peeped cautiously into the cafe the
three men were gone

  cursing my clumsiness i rushed up
and down the street there was  sign
of them i thought they might have gone
down one of the narrow cross streetsand
i peered round the first corner the
little street was dim and deserted

  i wheeled round wild with anxiety and
rage and dashed back to the other corner
that of the rue pierre haret and there
twenty yards away i saw three figures
moving slowly down the street close to-
gether while a fourth form followed a
little way behind then all at once
they all seemed to coalesce into one strug-
gling mass

  i rushed down toward them and a cab
passed me driving swiftly to the spot
as i came up i landed such a blow with
my loaded stick on the head of one of the
men that he dropped as if he had been
struck dead

    	s

  suddenly released wainwright stag-
gered back against the wall his hat
had fallen off and his disordered hair
shone white but to my amazement i
saw that the second apache was wrestling
furiously with a young fellow in the
velveteen coat and baggy trousers of a
bohemian artist

   before i could take it all in the artist
had freed himself dashing his man down
with a crash on the pavement and he
instantly wheeled and grasped me by the
throat with a strangling grip

   ali-h-h  i gurgled speechless as
much from astonishment as from the
choking for it was penfield carrs face
under the big soft hat-carr whom i
had supposed safe at home in the hotel
dostendc

   look out-drop   carr exclaimed
letting me go and i ducked without
knowing why

  a knife swished over my shoulder
harmlessly and a man bumped heavily
into my back carrs fist shot out over
my head-there was a thud and a fall
it was the cab driver and i knew him
when i turned

  it was jules who had clashed with me
in new york

  for the moment he was knocked out

   come along mr wainwright can
you run quick carr exclaimed
 williams take his other arm

  but poor wainwright only moaned as
we dragged him between us up to the
boulevard in another half minute we
had him in a cab and were driving fast
toward the latin quarter

chapter xii

the black book

   where  earth have you been
wainwright what has happened i
exclaimed as soon as we were well off

  the millionaire lying back in one
corner murmured something indistin-
guishable but did not even open his eyes

   hes thoroughly done up by-what-
ever hes been through but how did
you get  his track i said to carr
 in disguise too by jove  i looked
over his picturesque get-up with a laugh
for i felt gay enough at the idea that
our troubles were over


the all-story magazine

   ive been on a still-hunt of my own
for the last couple of nights carr re-
plied  i put on this rig because an
artist can go anywhere and never gets
held up but it was sheer blind good
luck that made me sight him coming out
of that joint with the two toughs

   they were count courvoies men
hes been at the bottom of it all

   i thought so well hear it all as
soon as hes rested enough to tail

  but wainwright remained in his semi-
stupor throughout the ride and we had
almost to carry him up the dark stairs
to our room wherwe got him into bed
i went out at once to the cafe opposite
and brought up a bowl of coffee while
carr hastened up-stairs to tell laura

   returned first wainwright seemed
a little more awake and i got him to take
the coffee which after the first sip he
drank eagerly he looked up at me
questioningly

   thats better its really you will-
iams i thought i must be dreaming-
where is-

  at this moment laura burst in
in dressing - gown and slippers - pale
breathless - and flung herself on her
knees by the bed

  oh papa - papa its you i
thought id never see you again youre
all right youre not hurt what has
been the matter oh i thought i should
have died 

  she was stroking her fathers head
kissing his hand patting him over to
make sure that he was safe and sound
and then she burst into crying and buried
her head in the pillow

   laura daughter   said wainwright
brokenly  dont blame me for leaving
you i couldnt help it forgive me
-i- 

   i know-i know dont talk of it
said laura  it doesnt matter now-
since i have you back and now we can
all go away from this terrible city cant
we back home-back to america-to
new york

   uncle bob youll see about getting
our tickets for the first steamer wont
you the very first she repeated half
smiling and still half weeping

   you bet i will i responded with all
my heart but wainwright raised a pro-
testing hand

   wait he murmured and paused as
if from weakness

   i must speak to you williams-
alone-on something private

  laura looked astonished and hurt
carr merely surprised at being thus
turned out of the room but they went
at once

   we cant leave paris williams
dont buy any steamer tickets laura
and i have to stay until-

   yes until- i repeated  now
whats all this mystery

  his face had begun to flush with the
strong liquor and his voice grew firmer
 where am i   he questioned

   in the hotel dostende in the latin
quarter

   does count courvoie know that
laura is here 

   i hope not what has courvoie to
do with all this 

  wainwright hesitated long with his
eyes on my face

   the count has documents-business
documents - of the madison life he
said at last  theyre so important that
i darent appear before the investigating
committee without them

   i suspected something of the sort
how did he get them

  it was when i was ill in new york
last winter with pneumonia i was ir-
rational part of the time but i had lucid
intervals when i knew that i was liable
to die and there were certain things that
i wanted to have destroyed

   they were in the little safe you
know thats built into the wall of my
bedroom they had been there ten
years there were reasons why i couldnt
ask even laura to do it for me if you
had only been there-but there wasnt
time to send for you

  he stopped breathing heavily and a
dark shadow that i was afraid to define
began to rise in my mind

   the count had been with me a great
deal he went  at last  he seemed
to be a gentleman and he was a for-
eigner and would be away in a few
months and he knew nothing of ameri-
can business affairs and - finally one
day i gave him the combination of the
lock and asked him to burn what was
in the safe

   of course we were alone in the
prince of apaches



room i was too weak to lift my head
but when it was all oyer courvoie lifted
me up and i saw the grate full of
charred paper i thought it was all
right it took an immense weight from
my mind and i began to get better at
once

   i thought it was all right as i say
till that evening-you remember-at the
hotel richelieu then i learned that
courvoie had burned only part of the
things the most important the ledger
he had smuggled out he had it he
showed it to me

  he stopped again and i looked at him
with a heavy heart the shadow of
doubt that had risen in my mind was
become almost a certainty

   well it was a question of how much
he wanted for it i suppose i said
 what did you offer him  

  not exactly that you see - he
wanted to marry laura he insisted
that i should use my influence-

  and you refused i hope i inter-
rupted sharply

  wainwright was silent

   come now i said sitting down be-
side him  you havent told me all
you can trust me i hope take it that
im a detective acting for you as i am
i cant do anything unless youre per-
fectly frank what is the nature of the
documents-the ledger-that courvoie
stole 

  he was too weak to deny or to lie he
only looked at me with helpless pitiable
appeal

   swear that you will never speak of
it  he implored

  i stood up arid turned away

  no dont go williams he cried
 of course i can trust you only for
heavens sake remember what it means
to me-my business honor and all and
it was so long ago 

  the whole story came out-stumbling-
ly incoherently and squalid and tragic
enough-as i had foreseen

  tt was common enough indeed-the
story of funds taken from the immense
surplus of the madison life and mis-
used as his autocratic control of the
company enabled him to do of hundreds
of thousands transferred to the tottering
ocean trust company which was at one
time another of his enterprises of a jug-

gling with millions of assets from the
account of one concern to another till at
last almost without knowing how he
found them deposited to his own-it was
an old story simple enough in spite of
its complexity but it was an appalling
one to hear from henry wainwright
president of that model institution the
madison life

  the only redeeming feature was that
as it appeared hehad always kept the
idea of restitution in his mind for this
purpose as i gathered all the details of
his illegitimate transactions had been en-
tered with businesslike accuracy in the
ledger which he had mentioned and he
had kept this terrific and damning record
for ten years in the safe that he had had
specially built for it beside his bed

   i had not felt especially uneasy
about it he went  with an effort
 until you told me of the counts record
then that night while you waited for
me at the hotel it made an old man of
me i threatened entreated promised-
i dont know what i said

   when i heard that the man had
sailed for france again i didnt know
what to think but he had scarcely
more than got there than he cabled me
to come over at once and to bring laura
with me

   i was afraid to refuse i sailed un-
der a false name i suppose laura has
told you i did all i could williams
believe me but what could i do 

   you might have done a good deal
i said  but now you can just let me
alone and ill settle the fellow

   for heavens sake be careful will-
iams he cried in terror  you cant
understand what it means to me to
have such a thing come out after al
these years with the reputation i have
 im thinking rather of what the al-
ternative means to laura i told him
 why did you leave her

   i heard by accident that there was
a subpoena out for me to testify before
the committee i darent face it i
knew that courvoie would put in his
testimony too when our companys case
came up

   the only tiling to do w-as to delay
things by dodging the subpcena so i
disappeared and i couldnt explain to
laura or tell her where i was going


the all-story magazine

    i went to a little hotel in the north-
east part of the city i forgot that i had
only a little money with me and when i
found it out i was afraid to draw on my
letter of credit lest i should be recog-
nized and followed

    i stayed at the little hotel as long
as i could till my money ran out my
bill was due this morning and i couldnt
speak enough french to make explana-
tions

   i went out early this morning and
walked about i had a letter of credit
for ten thousand dollars in my pocket
but only a couple of francs to keep me
from starving

  if i had known where the count
lived i would have gone to him i be-
lieve but i didnt and i walked and
walked all day and all evening i
thought of going back to the grand
hotel but i was afraid

   finally late at night i remember
going into a cafe to rest and i think i
went to sleep i seem to recollect seeing
your face i thought then that i was
dreaming for i was pretty far gone
then i went out somehow two men
were helping me along and i was too
exhausted to care what became of me
then there was a row and then i was
in a cab-its all hazy

  i looked at my old friends haggard
and tortured face and pity swamped all
my other emotions

   youve been a greater fool than i
could have believed possible i said
 and youve been a coward but youve
suffered for it heaven knows that i
dont pretend to judge you so long as
you dont try to sacrifice your daughter

  what shall i do then he asked
faintly

   anything but that leave it all to
me-and carr i know how to deal with
fellows like the count well get your
ledger back all right youd better de-
scribe it accurately to me

    its a black book he said his voice
growing feebler  a common black-
bound ledger about six by ten inches
not very thick it was locked but that
fellow filed the hasp to open it its
half full of complicated accounts you
can easily recognize it by the broken
lock

    ill get it i said confidently  but

look here wainwright you must give
me your word that youll refund all
that money at once whats the total
amount 

   not over eight hundred thousand
id have done it before only it isnt easy
to produce nearly a million without show-
ing where it came from-and why but
ill do it the first thing when i get back
to new york if you can only get me out
of this trouble

   another thing you mustnt let carr
or laura suspect a word of this i
added  tell them that courvoie has
stolen documents which must be recov-
ered before the investigation comes off
do you understand  

  yes said wainwright almost in-
audibly

  he gave me one look and then his
eyes closed

  i thought for a moment that he was
dying and sprang up

  but his breath came and went regu-
larly he was simply in a deep stupor
of exhaustion and i left him to the
medicine of sleep

chapter xiii

love and liking

  i went softly out and looked up carr
and laura to whom i repeated my own
version of wainwrights confession and
troubles

   oh dear  said laura dismayed
 i thought we could go home i
thought the trouble was all over but it
seems that its only begun

  not a bit of it well get those
business papers back all right in no
time cried carr cheerfully  wont
we williams

   of course i said confidently but
i did not speak of the price that cour-
voie demanded for them

  it was then nearly four oclock in the
morning and with some difficulty i per-
suaded laura to go to bed again i
myself was ready to drop with fatigue
and carr was not much better we
went down-stairs found wainwright
still asleep and both flung ourselves on
the other bed where i at least lapsed
into immediate unconsciousness

carr awoke me about nine oclock
prince of apaches



and i opened my eyes from uneasy
dreams to find the sun pouring into the
room and wainwright still sleeping
soundly we went out quietly left word
with our concierge to send up lauras
breakfast and crossed the street to the
cafe where we took our own meals

  here sitting over our coffee and
pctits pains at a table on the sunny side-
walk i told carr what the count de-
manded in return for the precious black
book

   the fellow is actually trying to
blackmail wainwright into letting him
marry laura exclaimed carr in huge
indignation  well luckily laura will
have something to say about it he cant
force her surely he wont try

   i dont know wainwright has gone
to pieces hes utterly broken up hes
desperate and if he should be served
with papers to testify at the investiga-
tion and knew that fil-de-fer was go-
ing to produce-that record-hold it out
i mean-

   but is an american subpcena good
in france carr suggested

   i dont know i never thought of
that  i declared struck by this con-
sideration  but it doesnt matter
whether its legally good or not i
added after thinking for a few seconds
if the papers are served wainwright
will be morally bound to appear or his
absence would be the worst possible tes-
timony against him

   yes  suppose so but whats in
that stolen ledger anyhow

   wainwright didnt say exactly but
its so important that he darent appear
without it

   well weve got to get the blamed
thing away from your apache count
and well have to keep wainwright out
of sight or theyll start to investigate
him before hes ready but so far as
laura is concerned-dont worry

   why not

   well of course if it came to the
point if i had to do it to stop the mar-
riage i wouldnt hesitate to shoot that
fellow besides-

  yes-besides i said withan agita-
tion that i tried to conceal  how is
your own affair going carr what are
your chances  

   of course i havent worried her

with my nonsense while weve been here
shes had troubles enough but she
knows i think-she must have seen-
how i feel about it and well some-
times im optimistic and sometimes not
but you can be certain that im not
going to let anybody else take her away
from me not without a fight

  he did not know that it was a decla-
ration of war against me too and i was
sorry for the forced rivalry as i looked
at him brimming with friendliness
youth hope and animation

  i liked penfield carr too much to want
to beat him but i did want to beat him
was it a hopeless endeavor i caught
sight of my face in the mirror of the
cafe-door and i saw that i looked all
of my forty-odd years

  as i sat there warmed through and
through by the delicious morning sun
with the faint languor of fatigue still
lingering i grew strangely hopeful
hope is in the air of paris

  i listened vaguely to carrs chatting
and smoked a good deal as i gazed across
at the massed green of the luxembourg
gardens shining through the iron
grille

  distinguished-looking parisians dainty
women children nurse - maids hurried
loitered romped on the sidewalk like
people who knew the enjoyment of life
a vender of cream - cheese wandered
down the street with her musical cry
creme a la cre-eme a push-cart
full of strawberries made a vivid spot
of crimson up the rue vaugirard and
the warm sun and the cheerfulness of
paris gave me hope and daring and con-
fidence of success

   its only a question of money after
all i found that carr was saying

  money what do you mean i
exclaimed

   to buy courvoie off well offer
him a hundred thousand or a quarter
of a million wainwright will stand to
the bargain do you know where the
count lives

   no but i think i can find out

  and i told carr of my apache assist-
ant rochet in whom i felt more con-
fidence since he had passed me the warn-
ing on the boulevard

   we must find him said carr
 meanwhile we must get wainwright


the all-story magazine

into a room of his own and keep him
dark

   yes and wed better go back and
see if hes awake i remarked throw-
ing away my last cigarette  weve
left him alone long enough

  when we went back we found wain-
wright not only awake but out of bed
and dressed he seemed not much the
worse for his adventures beyond being
still weak and shaky but i saw again
with a shock how changed he was from
the man he had been three months be-
fore

  he was old and broken and his whole
manner was full of nervousness and ir-
resolution that marked the moral break-
up that had come with the physical-
that was in fact the cause of the physi-
cal the thing he had kept buried for
so many years had burst out at last with
shattering effect

  carr went down-stairs to order break-
fast for him and to make arrangements
for hiring another room while i went
up to see iaura she had been sitting
with her father before he was up and
 found her silently crying over him
alone in her room

  she seemed glad to bring her troubles
to me as she had done many times be-
fore

   poor papa-i dont know what can
be the matter with him she said  he
seems twenty years older and so worn
and broken isnt it incredible that
count courvoie should have turned out
to be that kind of man-a thief and a
blackmailer but i dont see why papa
doesnt have him arrested or else ignore
him or if the papers are really so very
important why doesnt he pay what the
man wants and have the trouble over

   the count wants a very high price
i remarked  but the papers he holds
are really very important and were go-
ing to try to come to terms with him
carr and-i are gping into the lions
den to-night if we can find it well
beat him down if possible but any-
how were going to have that black
ledger-by fraud or force dead or
alive 

  force do you mean that there
may be danger she asked anxiously

  its possible - if fil-de-fer is ob-
stinate

 and mr carr-

  are you afraid carrll be hurt i
interrupted rather roughly

  she was silent and a slow flush spread
over her face as she gazed down at the
damp handkerchief in her hand then
she raised her eyes and they were full
of a wonderful softness that i had never
seen in them

  it made my heart palpitate suddenly
-but was the look for me or for carr

   that isnt kind she said  mr
carr is a very old friend and you know
how terrible it would be to me if either
of you came to any harm in this affair
i like mr carr and i respect him great-
ly and you know what i think of you
 no but i should like to i said
she came and stood behind my chair
putting her hands on my shoulders

   i think-i think that you are and
always will be my dear old uncle bob
whom i shall always love better than
anybody

  this was too much

 laura you dont know what
youre saying  i blazed jumping up

  then as i confronted her hurt aston-
ished face i realized suddenly that it was
i who did not know what i was saying

   forgive me my dear i said calm-
ing down  im proud to be all that
and i hope indeed that youll never
think any worse of me

  and i left the room and went down-
stairs half elated half depressed wholly
puzzled i had learned only how far she
was from guessing the secret of my heart

chapter xiv

 the drop of cold

  however matters might stand with
laura it was her fathers affairs that
had to be straightened out first

  we lodged the unhappy millionaire in
a small room on the same landing as our
owir and i emphasized upon our con-
cierge that no one was to be admitted to
see  monsieur henry who was ill and
needed quiet which was true enough

  he gave us full authority to make in
his name any arrangements of a finan-
cial nature with the count that we could
for the recovery of that dreadful book
of accounts	
prince of apaches



  first of all we had to find the count
for tljfis i depended chiefly on emile
rochets aid if he failed us our only
resource would be chance unless indeed
we might encounter one of courvoies
gang and bribe him to take us to his
chief

  the most probable result of such a
move would be that we would be con-
ducted into an ambush where we would
both be slaughtered for we had ex-
changed blows with the apaches war
was declared and we would be marked
men when we next ventured upon the
montmartre heights with this pros-
pect i opened my trunk and began to
make certain preparations while carr
looked on

   what have you got in the way of
weapons i asked him

  a revolver isnt that enough

   were liable to find ourselves in
ticklish places to-night f said  a
revolver makes a noise and the police
are almost as dangerous to us as the
apaches better take a leaf out of the
book of our friends the enemy

  and i took a cane from my trunk
pressed a catch and drew out a shining
steel blade two feet long razor-edged
on both sides

   its silent and its worth ten pis-
tols in amelee  remarked  youd
better carry it

   no thanks said carr viewing the
sword-cane with disfavor  knives
arc an acquired taste i dont like em
ill stick to a gun and my fists

   your fists-very well ry this
then and i produced a most ferocious
pair of brass knuckles with spikes an
inch long i had taken them from a
famous american burglar eight years
ago

  oh heavensj carr exclaimed re-
coiling

   put them in your pocket

   no  he hastened to reply  i
shouldnt know how to use them be-
sides i dont want to mangle my vic-
tims how did you ever get such an
arsenal of unlawful weapons

   accumulation of years i said
 you havent seen half of them i
have a full set of burglars tools here
which may come in handy yet well
carry what weapons you like but im not

going to despise these things because
theyre not sportsmanlike were going
against human wild beasts

   whats that little bottle youre put-
ting in your pocket carr demanded

   chloroform i told him

 he shrugged his shoulders and
watched me in silence as i laid out the
sword-cane and oiled and reloaded my
pistol the brass  knucks  i put
back  had to draw the line at them
myself

  we still had a long time to wait be-
fore we could start on the expedition
i did not see iaura again i was ashamed
to meet her but i believe that carr
spent a couple of hours with her this
fact did not make the time pass any more
pleasantly for me and i was thoroughly
glad when at ten oclock we were driving
northward through the yellow glow of
the gas-lit streets

  the paris tenderloin blazed with
light and screamed with animation as
we left our cab at the hippodrome and
proceeded on foot to the long steps where
rochet had met me

  no one was there i had scarcely ex-
pected it yet i was deeply disappointed
and my chagrin grew during the fifteen
minutes that we spent waiting uselessly
about the place rochet had failed me
again

  there was just a possibility that we
might stumble upon him on the boule-
vard clichy and we spent an hour in
promenading that sensational thorough-
fare and investigating some of the cafes
that elbow one another along its length
we looked into the moulin rouge la
mart le rat mori aristide bruants
and that sinister drinking-house that
simulates a prison with a guillotine de-
capitating a dummy figure every ten
minutes in the center of the room

  we were going out of this place when
at the very door i met my apache coming
in

  excuses monsieur he exclaimed
with a gasp of astonishment and fright
as he recognized me  i was coming-
i didnt know-

   thats all right i said drawing
him out to the sidewalk and then in a
low voice  have you found what i set
you to find	v-

   yes but not till this very afternoon


the all-story magazine

i went to the sacre cceur to meet you
to-night but-

   thats a lie you didnt i com-
mented  hut never mind where
does fil-de-fer hang out

   cabaret de la goutte dor rue du
foin he meets his friends there every
night

   his gang i suppose what sort of
a place is it 

  the apache gave an inimitable shrug
not too good butsafe enough if
you go with me i have friends who
go there and i can introduce you
shall we risk it i said to carr in
english  i dont trust him too much
and the rue du foin is one of the worst
bits of montmartre

  risk it of course carr ex-
claimed  what else did you bring
your knives and knuckle-dusters for

   look out for trouble then and be
sure not to let anybody get behind you
lead on rochet and remember if theres
any row youll be the first to get hurt
the fellow broke into a torrent of
protestations but i made him stop and
he conducted us in a sulky silence west-
ward along the boulevard and then
north through a maze of mean streets
that seemed deserted and silent as death

to be e

  we met few persons and they all gave
our party a wide berth it was an omi-
nous sign and i kept one eye over my
shoulder most of the time until we came
into an almost semicircular curving
street that proved to be the rue du foin

  the cabaret of the drop of gold was
midway in its length it was a base-
ment cafe for its windows rose scarcely
to the street level and through the dingy
glass of the door i could see the top of
the broad steps going down

  beyond this i could see nothing but a
haze of smoke and the dim heads of a
number of men

  it was not very reassuring but it was
much what i had expected i glanced
at carr who wore an air of determina-
tion

  then rochet pushed open the door
and went in

  foul air smoke and alcohol fumes
smote me in the face like a gust as i
followed

  through the reek i dazedly saw every
face in the room turned toward us with
savage suspicion

  i put my finger on the catch of my
sword-cane

  for on the instant i expected an over-
whelming rush

the signet of kalikrates

                 by helen tompkins

  he goddess of truth reaching
  down through the ages
  hands one to a couple of bad men

-piieres a splendid monograph
i owned by a man named smith
 in your town-i saw it last
year said john archibald his
commonplace face lighting up  if you
are interested in such things-

   but you see i am not-unfortunate-
ly said graham softly  now gems-
yes i can understand and take an in-
telligent interest in them but-

   gems  archibald looked about
him uncertainly a letter from a mutual
friend had urged him to show richard
graham every courtesy in his power and
the perplexed antiquarian knew his lim-
itations  i have several good stones
frankly they are of interest to me only
in a limited way not that they are
especially valuable-

   i love them for their beauty re-
marked graham  color - sparkle -
they have an especial fascination for me
 strange  the old man had taken
a little oblong box from the open safe
 rubies  he hazarded  do you hap-
pen to be interested in rubies-by any
chance
the signet of kalikrates



  graham nodded as the kneeling man
peered near-sightedly up at him he was
able to control his face fairly well but
his fingers were twitching and it re-
quired all the self-control which he could
command to hold his longing in leash-
the longing to snatch the oblong box and
take to his heels as fast as he could he
told himself over and over that the thing
was madness - that old archibald
dreamer that he was was far too keen
a man of business to take foolish chances
with the archibald collection the envy
of the gem-lovers of two continents

  but his eyes burned as they rested
upon the rubies

   i wonder that you are not afraid to
keep them here he said as he sifted the
glowing stones through his fingers and
glanced furtively-at the old antiquarian
under his lowered lids  that is the
harden ruby is it not i think that i
saw it once-years ago

  john archibald was tapping the case
nervously with his long lean fingers

   yes that is the harden ruby he
said thoughtfully  i bought it last year
from the harden heirs i got a couple
of scarabs from them at the same time
i knew old andrew harden when i was
a boy so i could be sure of what i was
getting

  graham was weighing the magnificent
stone lovingly in his hand he looked
down into it as into a core of flame and
watched the shimmer of the crimson
lights within its glowing heart

    it is superb he muttered faintly as
he gave it back into the old mans keep-
ing

  he had been aware for a long moment
that the antiquarian had been eying him
curiously had his longing and greed be-
trayed him-had the old collector for the
moment caught him off his guard his
blood ran ice to his finger-tips

  perhaps his own fear had exaggerated
the magnitude of the danger

    i have one gem in my possession that
the public generally has no knowledge
of said the old man hesitatingly  i
am very anxious to show you every cour-
tesy of course mr graham yet there is
little that i can do i am a bachelor
and i have few friends so that socially
i can be of very little use to you finan-
cially i am quite as helpless i am sim-

ply a commonplace old man sir with an
income that suffices for my simple needs
and with a dozen fortunes-as useless to
me as to others-locked behind the doors
of this room if the sight of my stones
can give you pleasure-

  graham had regained in a measure
his self-control which the first sight of
the rubies had robbed him of he had
near made a fool of himself-he thanked
his guiding gods that he had done no
worse

   in the meantime john archibald had
evidently made a sudden resolve he
unlocked a drawer in the big steel safe-
juggled with a combination-and a
shallow compartment slid noiselessly
open

    this contains the gem of my collec-
tion he said in a lower voice  i do
not know how familiar you are with the
history of famous precious stones mr
graham-

  the young man shook his head mod-
estly

    i know something of them-not very
much he confessed

   archibald was not looking at him he
had taken a case from the compartment

    my uncle was a famous collector
he said slowly  he had a mania for
perfect unflawed diamonds-it amounted
to a passion with him-and he had money
to indulge his whims-which i have not
i have in this case sir a gem which once
belonged toroyalty

   the monarch into whose hands it
came just before my uncles time was in-
fatuated with a worthies woman who
made the possession of the gem the con-
ditional price of her passing favor his
love for her was so great that although
the prince knew that his country-his
throne-hung in the balance when he
clasped it about her throat he scarcely
weighed the matter in his own mind but
did as better men before him had done
and sacrificed-you know the rest sir
possibly better than i

    i am a bachelor as i have said and
the sex has little attraction for me

    the country-the princes country-
was in the first throes of a civil war just
then and the prince himself had but
little time to waste upon gauds or wom-
en he played his part bravely i have
been told


the all-story magazine

   but the woman tired of the royal
lover who had grown so neglectful and
the stone was practically thrown upon
the market i have heard that my uncle
-he died before your time young man-
paid the highest price for it that was ever
paid for a gem

   it was all under the rose however-
my uncles sense of honor was not so very
keen so far as diamonds were concerned
-for the stone belonged th the crown
jewels the woman had as little real
right to sell it as the prince had had to
give it away

   the prince died in battle after that
however and his death did what his life
could never have done-covered a multi-
tude of sins and helped his people to
make a martyr of him his name be-
came a thing to conjure with and his
successor kept the loss oofhe diamond a
secret as he had to keep many other
tilings for his own sake as well as for
the welfareof the state

   a skilfully made counterfeit costing
almost as much i dare say as the real
stone would have brought took its place
among the crown jewels and the loss
of the gem was known to very few pos-
sibly the knowledge of the fact was con-
lined to a half-dozen people

  graham smiled it was an old story
he knew-told of more than one jewel of
matchless size and flawed heart he
wondered that the old man should believe
him to be so gullible

  at that moment the case fell open and
the electric light flashed bakk in blinding
rays from a stone such as graham in his
wildest dreams had never seen before

   the famous barvoff diamond-the
eye of heaven said the old man a
sudden note of pride leaping to his
tremulous voice  it is an east indian
stone and came into the possesion of a
private soldier of the british empire at
the time of thesacking of the palace of
one of the native princes

   how it ever came there-how and
where the soldier gave it up-how it ever
reached through blood and crime the
princes own hands-

   i never saw anything-never dreamed
of anything-like it  graham was say-
ing senselessly over and over

  the rqom had suddenly grown sultty
and close a perspiration had broken out

on his forehead and he was breathing as
if he had been running - keeping for
hours a long killing pace up-hill

  he touched the stone reverently with
his fingers it was egg-shaped and ab-
solutely flawless - a single well-trained
glance told him that-and the light upon
it flashed back in rivulets of flame to
his mind it illuminated the entire room
and gathered to itself a radiance that
fairly blinded him it was not until the
old man watching it jealously had again
snapped the cover of the case down upon
it shutting out its light that graham
caught his breath with something almost
like a sob

   it is perfect-magnificent  he said
harshly  man i had no idea that
there was anything like it  this con-
tinent  

  archibald replaced the case in its
compartment shut the drawer and
swung the combination when he
turned again he was once more the
shambling near-sighted antiquarian

   very few people know anything
about the gem he said shortly  you
thought that i was lying when i told
you the diamonds history mr graham
-i read it in your face you know
now that i was telling you the truth

   i would believe anything that you
cared to tell me now said young
graham shakily he had not quite suc-
ceeded in pulling himself together

   i have a rather fine collection of
opals too said the old man hobbling
to another tiny safe set well back in the
wall  it is something in the nature of
an anti-climax it is true mr graham
but i should like to have you see them
i have the mania for opals that my un-
cle had for diamonds he added dryly
 they are nearer within my financial
limitations and they burn and glow and
scintillate and seem full of fire and
warmth

   diamonds on the contrary are heart-
less things to my mind not one of
them of any consequence but has taken
heavy and merciless toll of humanity

  he took a little wash-leather bag from
the safe and poured its contents out
upon the table there were a couple of
dozen stones like iridescent bubbles-
green and rose and violet lemon and
pearl and deeper rose the old man
the signet of kalikrates



watched graham sift them also through
his fingers like common pebbles

   they are matched and almost price-
less too in their way he remarked
 when i die the eye of heaven will
go back to its place in the royal jewel-
casket i have made my will to that
effect and i have provided too that
the harden ruby shall revert to the last
of the name-now a lad of five

  graham murmured something indis-
tinguishable under his breath

  i am sorry that you care nothing for
-other things said the old man wist-
fully  i could really interest you if
you did my father was a collector of
note sir-and his father before him i
have some bronzes and a couple of
manuscripts-

  but graham only shook his head

   i am sorry he said vaguely  i
somehow do not care to deceive you
mr archibald after your kindness to
me and i should only make a pretense
of interest that i could not feel i am
the veriest ignoramus-

   at any rate i have something that

i	cannot allow you to leave without see-
ing said the old man suddenly as if
yielding to an overmastering impulse
 you know something of egyptian his-
tory sir do you not

   very little confessed graham
flushing a trifle under the gaze of the
keen old eyes that were bent upon him

   my father traveled in egypt a dozen
years ago said archibald  he was an
old man then but as it happened he had
exceptional opportunities for securing en-
trance to places closed usually to the
average egyptian student and i have
never known what means he used he
came into possession of a ring-this
ring

  he took the ring from the same safe
which held the opals as he spoke and
laid it in grahams hand it was a cum-
brous heavy band of dark and beaten
gold set with a greenish flat stone cut
in the form of the sacred beetle

   it is the signet-ring of kalikrates
said the old man reverently  kali-
krates himself was a younger son of one
of the ptolemys who came to the throne
reigned only a few months and then be-
came the victim of a great plague that
swept the banks of the nile

   there is more than one old legend
extant with regard to him the egyp-
tians of his time called him by a name
which in our own language would mean

 the detector of deceit i value the
ring very highly sir aside from its
simple intrinsic value-

  graham was trying to appear inter-
ested he had overstayed his time in
the old house however and he was hunt-
ing about in his own mind for a decent
excuse to escape

    i assure you that i am very grateful
to you for your kindness sir he said
 i had no idea-

   slip the ring on your own finger
urged the old man  there has been an
age-old discussion waged as to the prob-
able deterioration of the race since the
time of thothmes now during the
reign of kalikrates-

  graham reddened the ring was
heavy clumsy and smaller than he had
thought he had slipped it on his finger
easily enough but he found it much more
difficult to remove it the sprawling
beetle seemed suddenly hideously alive
and grotesque the room was growing
almost intolerably close and warm to him
again

   easy sir-easy-you will bruise the
flesh said the old man eagerly he
was touching grahams hand himself
now with cool dry fingers like the fiut-
terings of a dead leaf  there i will
press this side it comes off more easily
that way you see-

  graham chafed his aching finger a
little ashamed of his momentary irrita-
tion

   i have stayed longer than i intend-
ed he stammered as the old man put the
signet-ring back in the safe  i must
beg your pardon mr archibald for hav-
ing trespassed so unpardonably upon your
time

    your visit has been a source of great
pleasure to me sir said the old man
politely  i am only sorry that your
stay in town is to be such a brief one
and that my own circumstances are such
that i cannot tender you the hospitalities
of my own home

  graham shook hands cordially with
him and then stumbled clumsily out of
the dark old-fashioned house into the
well-lighted street he was trying his


the all-story magazine

best to hold a tight grip on his straying
wits who would ever have dreamed-

ii

  at ten oclock that same night he was
sitting across the table from  jim  fin-
ney with a bottle of liquor and two
glasses between them

  no i dont drink-i never touch
liquor when there is work  hand he
said impatiently  what is the lay
jim

  finney with his effeminate voice slen-
der figure and soft curls drained his
second glass before he answered the ques-
tion

   did you ever hear of an old guy
named archibald he asked

  graham nodded

   i was out at his place to-night he
said  its noj going to be such an easy
thing finney the old chaps too confi-
dent by half hes got a dozen fortunes
in that safe of his and lies  fool

   hes trusting to the stones them-
selves said finney shrewdly  ive
seen an inventory of the old chaps valu-
ables and it reads like a fifth avenue
advertisement theres a half - dozen
stones there that a clever man wouldnt
touch with a ten-foot pole

 why

   well you may take the harden
ruby for example say we got hold of
that to-night barring the private col-
lectors-and the most of them i believe
are a fairly decent lot-theres nobody
wants it the police of practically every
country on the globe have had a squint
at it theyd spot it in less than twenty-
four hours cut it up we could have
that done of course but you see the
trouble is-

   i see said graham musingly but
he was not thinking of the ruby at all
-it was the diamond that he wanted
alesia had lost it through trickery and
deceit-its reigning monarch would be
only too glad to get it back without ask-
ing any awkward questions

   id rather have half a dozen stones of
a decent size-well matched flawless and
of a good color-than a peck measure
filled with harden rubies said finney
of course there is always an especial
market for things like that-somewhere

   for instance theres that diamond
that the old chaps so close-mouthed
about if a fellow could ever get to
alesia-but what earthly chance would
he have of getting there do you sup-
pose-with a whole skin  

   i fail utterly to see just what you
are driving at then said graham short-
ly  weve little enough time as ive
already told you before noon to-mpr-
row the fellow whose name and letters

i	stole will wake up from that nasty
crack on the skull that i gave him hes
clever enough to put two and two to-
gether when he does so weve only got
to-night

    theres a lot of opals that are worth
something and could be handled said
jim placidly ignoring the others heat

 martha-her sister is the old mans
housekeeper-says that there are several
decent diamonds and a couple of pearls
which she knows where we could dispose
of without awkwardness shes a clever
woman martha is and then there is
the ring of course

  ring

   the ring-yes the ring with the
green stone set-cut in the form of a bug
they say that the old man is fairly daffy
about that you saw it-did you not
fie added the last words a trifle impa-
tiently 

  graham caressed his finger which was
still slightly swollen from the signets
pressure

    oh yes i saw it he said moodily

  well theres a fellow named ham-
mond-or smith or jones one name is
just about as much his as the others-
who wants that ring and he is willing
to pay us a pretty good sum for the job
of getting it for him

   the ring  graham repeated the
word stupidly  what on earth-

   plain bug-house i guess said jim
cheerfully  all these trash-collectors
are-more or less and as unscrupulous
as the devil too-most of them are

   maybe old archibald has been too
chesty-been giving himself airs or some-
thing of the kind its none of your
business is it you dont want the
ring 

   not on your life  said graham
promptly and fervently

 well dont butt in then theres
the signet of kalikrates



a couple of husky chaps on the place
whom i guess that archibald is trusting
to guard his treasure but one of them
lias been bought and the other will be
drugged there are a dozen different
burglar-alarms too but martha has been
studying them for over a month and
they will be out of commission

   the old guy dont stand well with
the police it seems hes a stubborn old
fool and hasnt listened to advice or he
would have put the collection in a safer
place long ago what about the safe by
the way graham  

   ive never seen the safe yet that i
couldnt get into said graham gloomily
 some more-some less-trouble thgt is
all the thing looks too easy finney
that is what makes me so afraid of it
its not natural to have everything com-
ing our way even to my very name being
identical with the poor chap that i
knocked out i-dont like it

   oh youre superstitious-youve seen
the moon over the wrong shoulder
laughed finney who was the bolder spirit
of the two he leaned forward and the
two began whispering earnestly together

iii

  the ticket-agent was very tired and
very cross he was needing his vacation
badly he told himself as he drew a hand
across his burning eyes and lie was very
glad that his substitute was on the way
to relieve him there was a certain
alder-fringed lake and an ice-cold brook
that emptied into it and which he felt
quite sure was swarming with hungry
mountain trout if helen would rather-
 two tickets to pennisquad sir if
you please

  the ticket-agent pushed the two tickets
and the change across to the man with
scarcely a glance he was middle-aged
-the agent noticed that-and he had
iron-gray hair and a rather shrewd kind-
ly face

  a woman clung rather heavily to his
arm she was young dressed in mourn-
ing and her back-thrown veil showed her
face to be charming and also revealed
the fact that it was at the present time
tired and white her hair was black and
it curled in little rings about her temples
 gently lydia the agent heard the

  man say he fairly lifted her as he led
her to a seat  i knew that we were too
early-you will remember that i told you
so-too early by a good half-hour try
to compose yourself my dear

  he sat down on the bench beside her
as he did so a man on the other side
remarked that the trains were all late
caused likely by a cloudburst up the
river

  not our train thank heaven re-
marked the ticket-buyer affably  my
sister has just learned that her daughter
at pennisquad is very ill the news has
all but prostrated her it would be very
unfortunate indeed for her if we were
forced to experience any unnecessary
delay

  the other murmured sympathetically

   i wonder if the police will be able
to get a line on the men responsible for
the robbery last night he remarked evi-
dently with the laudable intention of
changing the subject  i noticed a
couple of officers outside-

   robbery

  the man produced a morning paper
 i live only a couple of blocks away
from the house that was robbed liesaid

   and i know old mr archibald by
sight i never spoke to him they say
that he is very badly cut up over the
affair here read it for yourself

  the man bound for pennisquad looked
at his feminine companion apprehensive-
ly then hurriedly scanned the page which
the other man had pointed out

daring robbery

cracksmen get valuable loot police in close
pursuit sensational development hourly
expected victim bound gagged and
left for dead

    tlic home of john archibald was en-
  tered by thieves some time last night
  the safe broken open or blown up and
  booty the value of which is unknown
  was stolen the thieves escaping by a
  rear entrance even while the police
  summoned by neighbors who had heard
  the explosion were hammering at the
  front door

    mr archibald was found bound and
  gagged-in a condition of insensibility
  while the man who usually attends him
  was evidently in a state of stupor and
  is still unable to give any coherent
  account of the affair


the all-story magazine

    mr archibalds age and the slate of
  his health for the past few months
  renders his condition since the brutal
  assault extremely serious and so far
  his physicians have refused to allow
  him to see any one or to make any state-
  ment for publication until he can do
  so the actual amount of his loss cannot
  he accurately determined

    the thieves made a clean sweep of
  everything and it is understood that
  the archibald collection of gems and
  coins have gone with the rest the po-
  lice claim to have established the iden-
  tity of the thieves and it is believed that
  the lines arc being so rigidly drawn thit
  escape from the city will be made im-
  possible and that they will be behind the
  bars before nightfall

    in addition to the regular men who
  are engaged on the case private detec-
  tives have been summoned from pitts-
  burgh they are expected to arrive to-
  day

 the man to whom the newspaper be-
longed received it back placidly

   ive got more faith in the detectives
than i have in the police he said con-
fidingly

 the other man turned sharply  my
sister has fainted he said shortly  call
a doctor will you shes had heart-
trouble im afraid-

  he caught the woman as she fell over
against him as he did so a tide of pas-
sengers from an incoming train swept
through the room the man holding
the woman stiffly helplessly in his arms
felt at that instant a light touch upon his
shoulder

   its no use graham the game is up
said a calm judicial voice  youd bet-
ter come with us quietly now and not
kick up any disturbance

 the man without relaxing his hold
upon the unconscious woman looked up
bewilderedly

   my name is simmons lie said blun-
deringly  harvey simmons from pen-
nisquad my sister has fainted she has
had bad news and i am taking-

  thatll do you new-for you gra-
ham said the same voice there was
a faint trace of irritation as well as of
amusement in it now  finneys tried
that dodge before come my friend
the mans bewilderment was evidently
fast changing to annoyance he looked
anxiously about him but save for one or

two more or less interested spectators who
had noticed the little controversy and
heard the detectives words no one was
apparently paying any attention to them
nor did the man whom he had sent to
summon the doctor return

   my sister has fainted you confound-
ed fool  he said again  call a doc-
tor will you  

  he leaned forward a little and drew
the heavy mourning-veil across the white
face that rested upon his knee as he
did so a man shouldering his way past
the detective appeared upon the scene
 i am a physician he said curtly
 what is-

  the sight of the slender motionless
figure brought a cry to his lips he
threw the men aside and dropped on one
knee by the side of the unconscious
woman  of all the fool- he mut-
tered and then checked himself sharply
 what in the world are you doing
with this woman-here   lie demanded
harshly

   i know you doc said the detective
doubtfully  the fact is we mistook
this party for a man named finney
whos pulled off more than one neat job
and got away afterward disguised as a
woman but if you say that its all
rights	 -

   irs not all right ouve made us
miss our train when it was a matter of
life and death said the man from pen-
nisquad belligerently  you can think
that over at your leisure-you dog 

  an outbound train sucked the station
dry of the flood of humanity that had
overflowed it

   here you said the doctor sharply
 get a carriage  

   the detective slunk back a little as the
man fronj pennisquad with an anguished
glance at the still unconscious woman
hurried out of the station

   the two answered to the description
all right said the officer who was with
the detective and who still stood his
ground  you see its an old dodge
of finneys and hes bound to be in
town yet we know-lie hasnt had a
chance to get away

  the woman saved the doctor the neces-
sity of voicing the profane sarcasm that
was trembling on his tongue she moaned
slightly
the signet of kalikrates



   i cannot go back home she saicl
peevishly  lottie is desperately ill at
pennisquad doctor please give me a
stimulant of some kind- must go to
her 

  somebody brought water and a spoon
-the officious station-agent lifted the
womans head while the doctor gave her
a close of medicine

   youd as well let her go-wheres
the fellow that she was with   said the
station-agent with a glance at the de-
tective that fairly shriveled him

  the doctor nodded  its a choice of
evils i guess he said ungraciously  i
wont answer for the consequences if she
goes but i wouldnt if she stayed for
that matter youd better let her take
it as easy as she can he added to the
man who had reentered the station

   i couldnt find a carriage and our
train hasnt gone yet after all said the
man anxiously  shell fret herself to
death if she stays if youll help us on
the train doctor ill take my chances
with her-rather than stay here

  the doctor looked doubtful but
steadying the patient on one side while
the brother supported her on the other
the three walked slowly toward the train
an officer evidently watching all out-
going passengers made a step forward
but the chagrined detective still linger-
ing said something to him in a low voice
and he dropped back a little

   i wish that youd go with us doc-
tor-id make it worth your while said
the womans brother nervously when they
had made the woman as comfortable as
possible in the rear car

  the doctor hesitated his hand on the
womans pulse the conductor loiter-
ing through the car looked at the little
group keenly farther toward the front
of the car an elderly man with a good-
humored face and a badge securely hid-
den by his tightly-buttoned coat watched
the conductor

   i dont know said the doctor
feebly  ive an appointment for ten
oclock and what on earth my wife will
think has become of me-

  he snapped the lid of his watch shut
and beckoned to the conductor

  if i run on down to pennisquad
with these people when can i get back
to town he asked

   twelve-fifteen sir-its only a mat-
ter of twenty miles to pennisquad said
the conductor  you can stay there half
an hour and then take the fast express
back

    id better do it then said the doc-
tor resignedly  where does lottie live
-in town  

   she lives half a mile from pennis-
quad her husband is a market-
gardener if i had known-

   you can take a carriage at the sta-
tion said the conductor eying the
womans garrulous brother much as the
detective had done

  the conductor sauntered on through
the car turned retraced his steps and
in obedience to a slight gesture dropped
into the seat beside the good-natured
man who was so anxious to spare
peoples feelings that he kept his badge
of office hidden just as the train pulled
out of the station

  well who are they the man
asked

   the tall one is dr lucas from the
sanatorium here in town hes a pretty
decent sort of chap i dont know the
woman but the doctor evidently does or
he would never have left town with her
she looks awful sick the man-

   what has the man got to do with
them 

   i dont know-i never saw him be-
fore he appears to be a connection of
the sick woman in some way-maybe
hes her brother i dont know him
 hes the one that i want to look out
for then said the good-natured man
slowly and with quite another look on
his face  get him up this way on
some pretext-will you

  the conductor nodded but his inter-
vention was not necessary the sight of
his sisters pale face evidently made the
man from pennisquad nervous he left
her in the doctors care and drifted
miserably toward the other end of the
car the conductor went on into the
smoking-compartment

  the man from pennisquad singled
out the middle-aged gentleman with the
sympathetic face who was sitting alone
and in obedience to another slight
gesture he dropped into the seat beside
him as the conductor had done a moment
before


the all-story magazine

   this is rotten luck that im hav-
ing he said forlornly  any other
time lydias husband would have been
in town now-

  what is the matter asked the
ether encouragingly he was an old
man from bradfords agency and he
knew graham well he was  telling
himself positively now that the man be-
side him was not graham-nor any one
whom he had ever seen before

  well you see my sister-back there
is an invalid lucas has been treating
her for over a year now decent chap
that i could tell you things- and very
moderate in his charges too so my
brother-in-law says i only came up
from pennisquad myself this morning

   found horace gone and five min-
utes after his train pulled out here
comes a telegram from pennisquad say-
ing that lottie my niece is not expected
to live and i know from lucass looks
that hes doubtful whether lydia makes
it or not if lottie-

  his voice broke a little and he looked
gloomily out of the car-window

  the detective muttered some platitude
half under his breath but his mind was
elsewhere he knew that the town had
been thrashed relentlessly - that every
outgoing train had been closely watched
he knew moreover that the law had
two of the cleverest rogues on the face
of the earth to deal with and that the
two were playing for the highest pos-
sible stakes

  there was nothing for him to do now
but to drop off at pennisquad and take
the first train back to town lie told him-
self dismally it was possible of
course that the two thieves arrange-
ments having been made beforehand
had dropped into a boat while the police
were still hammering at the door of the
house on larch street and had drifted
unnoticed down the river

  he worried over the aspect of the
affair for some time discouraging con-
versation once he felt sure that the man
beside him was not the one whom he
sought proffering the morning paper at
last in order to have his thoughts to him-
self

  the fact of the business was that all
of the particulars of the robbery had not

been given out to the public

  stirred by his loss and stung by the
fact that a man whom he had himself
allowed entrance to his home had taken
advantage of his hospitality to rob him
john archibald had rallied all the
strength of his keen intellect in order to
retrieve his blunder he had been able
to recall every smallest detail of gra-
hams visit to the house-even to the dif-
ficulty with which the young man had
met when he attempted to remove the
signet-ring from his finger

  he told the police emphatically that
when they succeeded in finding the man
who had robbed him they would find
the third finger on that mans left hand
still bruised and swollen from the pres-
sure of the sacred beetle carved upon the
signet of kalikrates

  the man from bradfords agency
greer looked across at the left hand of
his companion - the hand which was
nearest him and which held the unfold-
ed newspaper-for the second time it
did not disappoint him that the third
finger of that hand bore neither bruise
nor discoloration

  he had already felt quite as assured
that the man could not be finney whom
he had never seen any more than gra-
ham whom he remembered to have once
arrested on some trivial charge-years
before it did not need the corrobora-
tive evidence of the unmarred finger to
convince him that he was following the
wrong trail

  he tired of inaction after a little
and remembering suddenly that there
was a telegraph station ten miles between
the town he had just left and pennis-
quad he quitted his seat with the inten-
tion of either coaxing or browbeating the
conductor into letting him off there he
climbed awkwardly across the knees of
his companion who was now apparently
immersed in his paper and walked down
the aisle not in the direction of the rear
end of the car but toward the smoking-
compartment into which he had just
seen the conductor disappear

  as he laid his hand upon the rear of
of the last seat to steady himself-they
were going at a fair rate of speed the
roadway was rough and the car was
rocking like a ship in a gale-he saw a
face in the wide mirror liefore him  a
face alert keen not unkindly and a
the signet of kalikrates



hand raised to unsnap the catch of an
eye-glass

  recognition - comprehension-action
-came in a flash

  the detective wheeled his revolver
barked a staccato challenge and the
 doctors  shattered wrist dropped the
pistol which had appeared only the frac-
tion of a second later than the detectives
own his own shot followed closely but
the bullet sped past harmlessly

  in an instant the whole car was in an
uproar the man from pennisquad
sprang up with a snarl and he and the
detective swayed up and down the aisle

  the man with the shattered wrist
snatched at the bell-cord and a shrill
whistle from the engine answered the
signal to lessen speed the invalid with
surprising agility sprang forward but
the wrestling trio-the wounded man
had joined the others by this time-fight-
ing down the narrow aisle hemmed her
helplessly in twice the detectives re-
volver spoke but both shots went wild
he dropped the pistol then or it was
wrenched from his grasp and still fight-

ing like a bulldog he went down with
the other two uppermost

  by this time the train had jangled
and jarred roughly to a halt-a dead
stop-and the conductor and a couple of
other men stumbling through the debris
of shattered glass entered through the
car door hands up men said a
sharp voice  now  

  the woman-finney in disguise-
gave one despairing look at the rear
door of the car and then surrendered

   youre a dead ringer of lucas
graham he said cheerfully  how
in the world did you manage it

  but graham nursing his shattered
wrist had turned sulky too and would
not answer

  one by one the prisoners were safely
ironed as he slipped the cuff over
grahams uninjured hand the detective
glanced at the swollen discolored finger
and grinned

  across the gulf of buried and for-
gotten centuries the dead kalikrates had
vanquished error and deceit and brought
triumph to the truth

woodland vespers

 by clarence uimy

 v i eve i climb a vine-clad hill

  and looking toward the west

i gaze upon a distant slope

 with groves of redwood dressed

 it lies across a dark ravine
 with cottage lights aglow

 where faint farm sounds steal up the glen
   and down the valley blow

ihave not very long to wait

 when far in twilightland
 an angel sets the evening star
 with gently trembling hand

 i hear the wind die down the vale

 the herd-bells cease their tune

 and incense unperceived by day
   along the air is strewn

 i watch the star-it slowly falls
   like pentecostal fire

 down down until it tips with gold
 the tallest redwood spire

 tis time to pray an evening prayer
 and hum an evening hymn

 then soon with sleep go starry led
   down dream-paths cool and dim

george ripley secret-service agent is detailed to ferret out the circumstances
of the intermittent extinguishing of the white shoal light on the coast of massa-

chapter v

the spell of suspicion

ror several seconds my scattered
wits left me no defense against
the assaults of rapidly multiply-
ing fears

  for the first time in my life i ex-
perienced-more strongly than i ever
had imagined them to be-the terrible
sensations that overwhelm a shrinking
trembling coward

  and yet i may say in perfect truth
that i was not a prey to superstitious
fancies nor did i stand in fear of phys-
ical violence

  the sudden awful fate that first had
overtaken baintree and wilson and then
had compassed the death of cowden had
in a measure prepared me for this mys-
terious disappearance of the old keeper
one horrible awe-inspiring incident had
succeeded another so quickly that most
of my sensibilities were as benumbed as
those of a soldier who with his com-
rades falling to right and left of him
thinks only of the accomplishment of the
grim task at which his superiors have
set him

  the fears that overcame me were those
that had their origin in what appeared

to be my utter isolation and helplessness
in an hour when i was confronted by the
most responsible task to which i ever
had been assigned if torrens also had
succumbed to the mysterious fate that
had sent baintree wilson and cowden
to their deaths what was to be meted out
to me

  it was not death that i feared but
disgrace ignorant of the nature of the
mechanism of the lamp and bell how
was i to keep them working through the
night several days might pass before
i would be able to get into communica-
tion with the shore and during those
days and nights the loss of ships and
human lives might be the price of my
inability to keep bell and beacon work-
ing on this billow-battered shoal

  while incapable of motion i was
standing thus my gaze turned seaward
with a thrill of satisfaction i perceived
that though the sky was heavily over-
cast the fog was lifting so rapidly that
i was able to see distinctly a big four-
masted schooner that was passing the
lighthouse about two miles distant

  under these circumstances was it not
possible that torrens himself had si-
lenced the bell

  stepping quickly to one side of the

in the tarantulas skein



  lantern i looked down on the platform
  that girdled the tower at the level of the
  watch-room

    immediately below me was the bell
  and a couple of paces to the left of this
  i saw the figure of a bareheaded man
  kneeling with his right shoulder resting
  against the rail

    it was torrens

    with mingled feelings of joy and fear
  satisfaction and horror i watched the
  figure with fascinated eyes at first it
  seemed to be inert then i saw the bowed
  head move slightly upward a few mo-
  ments later the old keeper put  his
  cap and rose he had been praying

    with a low cry of relief i turned
  again to the stairs as i reached the
  watch-room the door leading to the plat-
  form was opened and torrens entered

     you were callin sir  he asked

     the bell has stopped said i

     aye the fog has lifted torrens
  answered as his gaze wandered to where
  the body of cowden lay then with
  a sudden affectation of cheerfulness he
  added  well sir i suppose youll be
  wantin a bite of somethin now

    not yet i answered promptly
  before the light gets dimmer i want
 you to explain to me the working of the
 lamp and bell

    the keeper stroking the gray fringe
  around his face looked at me ab-
  stractedly

     there are only two ofus here now
  i went on  and in view of the fact that
  disaster has overwhelmed the three men
  who had the watch last night it is just
  as well perhaps that each of us should
  be prepared to relieve the other
  torrens nodded approvingly

 aye sir you are right he said  i
ought to have thought of that before
pausing for a few moments he let his
gaze rest on the little engine then he
continued

     there aint anything below here ex-
   cept the oil-room that has anything to
  do with the light or bell every mornin
  we pump up enough oil from the oil-
  room to fill the tank of die lamp clock-
  work machinery feeds the four circular
  burners all night and after the burners
  are lit and the clockwork set goin there
  aint much for the watcher in the watch-
  room to do but to stay awake and keep

his eye peeled for the cornin of fog or
snow

   sometimes the smoke of forest fires
gets out here to sea and when it settles
heavy weve got to keep the bell
a goin if the light above goes wrong
you couldnt fail to know it settin here
for the lamp we burn in the watch-room
aint none too bright and the glow of
the big one comes to you down the stairs
and through the windows

  then bidding me follow him he led
the way up to the lantern where raising
the big cone of prisms he showed me the
four circular wicks and explained to me
how they were trimmed and fed the
mechanism of the clockwork pump and
the feed pipes i found to be extraor-
dinarily simple and in my presence tor-
rens lighted the big lamp for the night
and lowered the cone

  returning to the watch-room the
keeper explained the mechanism of the
engine and the manner in which it rang
the bell this done he took from a little
shelf a volume containing rules for the
conduct of lighthouses together with
illustrated directions for the use of their
equipments

  as the keeper replaced the volume he
nodded toward a second book which lay
 the same shelf

   the other is the  international sig-
nal code  he said carelessly  i
reckon you wont have no use for that

   why is it here i asked

   most lighthouses has em the
keeper replied  when a lighthouse is
on shore passin ships-specially sailin
vessels on long voyages-ask the keeper
to report them this is easy enough to
do when theres a newspaper near you
that gets associated press service but
most newspapers know the white shoal
is too far out to be in communication
with the land more than two or three
times a month at most so they dont
waste time or money burnin signal
lights for us

  the keeper now suggested that we go
below in order that he might make prepa-
rations for dinner i assented and
torrens led the way down-stairs

  without pausing in the living-room
we made our way to the sleeping-room
here the old keeper observed something
that caused him to halt abruptly


the all-story magazine

   following the direction of his glance

i saw a wooden soap-box standing on end
near the head of one of the cots on the
box were a glass a bottle and a little
heap of white muslin

    whats these things doin here  the
keeper muttered wonderingly  jack
wasnt the sort of fellow to let things
lay around like this

  though the coverings of the cot were
in their proper order the pillow still re-
tained the impression of the head that
had lain on it last and the gray blanket
was somewhat wrinkled

  hadnt we better have a light i
asked for it was after sundown now and
the dark clouds were shortening the pe-
riod of twilight

   aye said torrens quietly and a
few moments later he had lighted a lamp
in a bracket on the wall

  picking up the bottle i raised it to
my nose

   whisky-and empty i muttered
as i put the bottle down  was cow-
den a drinking man  

   once in a while hed take his nip
sir but not often replied the keeper
jack wasnt what youd call a drinkin
man

  unfolding the muslin gingerly i
found within it a mass of flaxseed

  it was plain that the muslin and the
flaxseed had served as a poultice and
i asked torrens whether while he had
been in charge of the lighthouse he had
kept a supply of flaxseed on hand he
replied that he had done so and this
probably had been taken from a medi-
cine-box on the top shelf of one of the
cupboards

  while torrens was making this ex-
planation something under the cot
caught his eye and stooping he drew
out a coal-scuttle in which rested a stove-
poker

  the keeper looked at the scuttle with
puzzled eyes

   is that the place in which it is
usually kept   i asked

   torrens shook his head negatively

    it aint time for flres yet he mut-
tered  and besides that the only two
stoves weve got belong to the kitchen
and the livin-room the livin-room
stove was taken down in the spring and
aint been put up yet so there aint no

use for a scuttle above the kitchen any-
how we never kept no scuttles here id
better take it down i reckon

   no said i  well leave it for
the present where you found it but
before you put it back again let us see
if there is anything else under the cots

  nothing else was found however and
after returning the scuttle to the place
from which torrens had drawn it we
threw the poultice out of the window and
carried the box and bottle to the kitchen
on the floor below torrens had been
about to hurl the bottle after the poultice
but i restrained him

   i was resolved that while i was in the
lighthouse i would permit to go unchal-
lenged no incident however trivial

  that the bottle had contained whisky
was obvious but the odor of whisky is
sufficiently strong to disguise the odors
of other liquids which have even more
deleterious effects on the human system
than the distillation of rye i carefully
corked the bottle therefore and put it
into one of the cupboards

  while torrens busied himself with
preparations for dinner i remained with
him in the kitchen and as the atmos-
phere of the place became charged with
the odors of frying ham and boiling po-
tatoes we talked of the manner in which
the lighthouse was constructed the for-
mation of the shoal the course followed
by vessels as they passed on their way
up and down the coast and of the method
of receiving supplies of oil coal water
and provisions

  while in the kitchen both of us
avoided all references to the mysterious
extinguishment of the light or the prob-
able causes of the strange and abrupt
departure of baintree and wilson and
the death of cowden

  by the time the meal was finished i
had made a careful study of the old
keeper and had obtained much detailed
information concerning the responsibili-
ties daily routine and diversions of the
custodian of a lighthouse

  i also learned that twice each month
a lighthouse-tender-a steam-vessel of
about fifteen hundred tons-visited the
shoal and left supplies of oil water and
coal on these occasions the building
usually was inspected by a representative
of the lighthouse board
in the tarantulas skein



  the keeper was required to find his
own provisions and these were brought
from charlesport sometimes in one of
the lighthouse boats but more frequently
in an auxiliary sloop belonging to cap-
tain samuel yarnall a charlesport fish-
erman whose first wife was a sister of
torrens

  landings on the shoal usually were
made at low wafer at which time a strip
of sand that was free from rocks was ex-
posed on the land side of the shoal this
strip sloped so abruptly however that
at low tide there was a depth of seven
fathoms of water at a point only a hun-
dred yards from low-water mark

  the bell was on the east side of the
tower and the oil-room door by which
the building was entered was on the
north or landward side

  the keeper also told me that under the
oil-room was an unlighted compartment
containing a fresh water tank and a bin
sufficiently large to hold six tons of coal

  when our meal was finished torrens
addressed himself to the task of washing
the dishes while i leaving the keeper
alone in the kitchen visited each of the
apartments above

  a careful examination of these con-
vinced me that unless an inspection of
the coal and water compartment should
afford me ground for suspicion there
was no place in the building in which an
intruder could find concealment

  thus far it was possible to find only
two theories for the extinguishment of
the light namely-the existence of some
defect in the mechanism by which the
lamp was operated or a conspiracy to
which a custodian of the tower was a
party to both of these theories there
were obvious objections

  while defective mechanism might re-
sult in the extinguishment of the light
it was altogether improbable that it
could light it again

  in view of thp fact that the entire
crew of the lighthouse had been changed
twice and that neither of these changes
had been effective in preventing the ex-
tinguishment in heavy weather it seemed
unreasonable to assume that apparently
trustworthy men coming from other sec-
tions of the country could within such
a brief period be prevailed upon to enter
into such a dangerous conspiracy

  a third theory-somewhat vague and
absurd indeed-had suggested itself to
my mind i asked myself whether or
not it was possible that owing to some
strange meteorological condition due to
conflicting currentsor the action of waves
 the shoal some sort of mist not vis-
ible elsewhere might envelop the tower
and shut in its light

  in justice to myself however i will
say that the idea seemed so wildly im-
probable that i promptly dismissed it
from my thoughts

  it will be remarked that since my
arrival at the shoal the subject of the
extinguishment of the light had been
uppermost in my mind despite the horror
that had been impressed upon it by the
deaths of the three men who had ten-
anted the tower on the preceding night

  though i well knew that an investiga-
tion into the causes of these tragedies
would constitute a part of the task to
which i had been assigned i decided that
this must remain for the time being at
least subordinate to the purpose of my
visit to the shoal

  i was now in charge of the lighthouse
on the white shoal and had been
ordered to keep the light burning every
minute of the night from sunset until
sunrise this must be my task

  by daylight only would i flbd it pos-
sible to devote myself to inquiries con-
cerning the failure of others to do the
things that i now was required to do

  i did not doubt that the cause of the
lights disappearance was in some degree
responsible for the sudden flight of bain-
tree and wilson

  it was possible that cowden who had
committed suicide without having learned
of the disaster that had overtaken them
might have had something to fear as the
result of their safe arrival on shore

  had he driven them out or had they
stolen away to report that they had dis-
covered that he was a party to a con-
spiracy to darken the lighthouse while
storms were raging

  had he taken his life because he knew
that his faithlessness was known

  thus far torrens had impressed me
favorably but torrens and cowden
long had been in a position of intimate
relationship the old keeper had told
me much but had he told me all 


the all-story magazine

  and so i resolved that while i was
in charge of the white shoal light i
would trust no man

   i must not sleep

chapter vi

according to the cope

  torrens was still below when glan-
cing at my watch  saw it was seven
oclock

  stepping to the window of the living-
room i looked out over the sea

  sky and waters were dark but far-
far in the distance i saw the faintly
glowing beams which the apparently in-
significant cone in the lantern above me
was projecting to the unseen horizon

  for the last ten minutes the clapping
and bellowing of the waves on the shoal
had been growing louder-so loud in-
deed that despite all my efforts to ac-
custom myself to the situation i began
to find it impossible to free my mind
from a rapidly increasing sense of alarm

  at times the very shoal itself seemed
to shudder while attempting to rally
from the shocks caused by the terrific
impact of hundreds of tons of water
which hissed and crashed and rumbled
the curses and threats of the angry sea

  though the casement was closed i
distinctly heard the fierce rush of the
blast that was heralding the approach of
a storm had i been  the deck of a
vessel i doubtless would have felt no
fear while viewing the threatening aspect
of the night for a vessel is a thing of
life and motion dominated by the active
minds of men who are trained to fight
the sea

   hut the chill gray stone cone in which
 stood now seemed to me to be  more
than a mere battered time-worn play-
thing of relentless waves within the
last four hours the heaving waters had
engulfedtwo of the three men who had
passed the preceding night within its ill-
omened walls which now were sheltering
the body of the third

  were these thundering billows clamor-
ing for the lives of the two living men
who occupied the building now

  i started violently as i felt a hand
fall on my shoulder turning i looked
into the bloodshot eyes of torrens

    your nerves not failin sir i hope
the keeper said surveying me with an ex-
pression of apprehension  why you
just jumped as if you seen poor jack
cowdens ghost

   ill be steady enough in half an hour
or so i answered  these waves
youve got out here have shaken me up
a bit i guess i didnt hear you come
up the stair and when you touched me
on the shoulder i-

   aye well have a nasty night said
torrens solemnly  the tides a risin
and theres like to be some heavy poundin
on the shoal before the sun is up

  i turned apprehensively toward the
window and looked out

   will the breakers be much worse
than they are now i asked

  the keeper shook his head gravely

   lord bless you sir they havent be-
gun to talk yet in an hour from now
the old atlantic will throw its white arms
around this tower and make love to it
in a way that you wont be likely to for-
get if you live to be as old as me i
tell you these confidential talks of a
stormy sea specially when it begins to
brag of all the great things it can do
aint the pleasantest sort  talk a lands-
man wants to listen to

   well however confidential the talks
may be there is nothing to be gained by
listening to them if they dont aid us in
solving the mystery of the light i re-
plied

  torrens nodded

   shall we go to the watch-room   he
asked  everything is snug below

  i assented and the keeper led the way
to the room above

  upon entering the watch-room we
seated ourselves at the table without
asking me whether or not i was inclined
to play torrens opened a checker-board
and arranged the pieces

   checkers and books is the only things
thats left to us  a night like this the
keeper explained as he marked my hesita-
tion ten minutes from now we wont
lie able to hear each other talk across
the table

  these words had scarcely left the
keepers mouth when there was a sud-
den crash below and the lighthouse
trembled from top to bottom a feeling
of faintness seized me and with an ex-
in the tarantulas skein



olamation of alarm i sprang to my feet
the old man rose also and laid a hand
on my arm

   easy easy sir  he said reassur-
ingly  theres no danger well have
far worse than that before the night is
over even if they came a hundred times
as strong as that one the mornin would
find our old gray tower safe and sound

   what was it i asked breathlessly

   only a wave the keeper answered
with a smile  youll get used to em
by and by

  a few moments later another larger
than the first made the old structure
sway and shudder

   here they are observed torrens
complacently

  rallying all my powers of self-control
 now steadily returned the keepers
questioning gaze he quickly marked the
change that was coming over me and
the look of apprehension faded from his
features and he glanced again toward
the checker-board

   will you have the red or black sir 
he asked and he began to finger the
pieces

   neither-yet i answered promptly
 let us talk a little while if we can
i want you to tell me something of your
unfortunate young friend jack cowden

  as we seated ourselves again at the
table the keeper glanced over his shoul-
der to where the body of his dead as-
sistant lay beneath the blanket

  the old man sighed and shook his
head

  there aint much to tell he an-
swered gloomily  its just a simple
story of a fish in lad that went all wrong
when he fell in love with a pretty girl
who thought herself too high for him

   the girl was sally lane the daugh-
ter of old captain bill who used to own
the biggest shipyard in charlesport bill
made quite a pile of money and when
he was pretty much along in years he
married the parsons daughter

   sally was their only child and was
just turned sixteen when her mother died
bill took to drink sent sally away to
school began to speculate and lost his
money he sent for sally then and
when she got back the folks in charles-
port werent long in seein that her fancy
school had spoiled her her father was

ruined but she wore fine clothes and
tossed her head at all the plain-fashioned
folks and ways of charlesport

   and yet she seemed to still have a
sort of fondness for her old sweetheart
jack cowden and jacks love for the
girl grew stronger though sally put it
plainly to him that she had higher ideas
for herself than to marry him

   a year ago this month she went to
portland and before she went she
turned poor jack down for good and all
in portland she lived with her aunt and
word come to charlesport that old cap-
tain bills girl was makin lots of friends
and havin pretty lively times in portland
and augusta

   when folks in charlesport told jack
these stories a big change came over the
lad and i dont believe he ever laughed
aloud again he fancied every one was
watching him and makin sport of his
pain then he came out here to me

   he didnt want no more fishin he
told me and he asked me if  couldnt
give him a berth out here with me my
assistant had turned up drunk a few days
before and jack knew i was about to
fire him

   i gave the job to jack and he
proved to be the likeliest lad i ever had
out here to help me he never had no
cravin to go ashore and though he was
a bit moody at times he was always
willin-fairly studyin out new things
to do to make life cheerful for us both
in tlfis lonely tower all went well un-
til-until-

  i heard no more from without there
came a sound like that of a terrific thun-
der-clap and the tower trembled more
violently that it had done before

  the room seemed to be whirling round
me shaking like a leaf i staggered to
my feet but overcome by a strange feel-
ing in the interior of my body i gasped
for breath and sank into my chair

  my lips were parched and perspira-
tion was breaking out on my forehead

  my alarm was intensified by a recog-
nition of the fact that torrens was suf-
fering almost as much as i

  the old keeper who only a few min-
utes before had spoken so confidently of
the stability of the tower was trembling
too and his face which had been florid
before was gray as ashes now


the all-story magazine

  he was standing at the foot of the
stairway that led up to the lantern and
with his frightened eyes turned toward
mine he appeared to he listening in-
tently

  struck by bis attitude i listened too
the waves now seemed to be on the
point of engulfing the tower smiting the
structure higher and delivering their
blows in more rapid succession

  starting suddenly torrens looked up-
ward to where the iron stairway entered
tli  floor above

  for the moment i forgot my fears

  the lights all right i shouted
anxiously

  the keeper glancing toward me again
was about to speak when he suddenly
checked himself and raised a warning
finger

  then mingling with the roar of the
waters that lashed the tower there came
another sound rather more quick and
sharply defined than those that rose
around us

  as i listened two other sounds similar
to the first succeeded it

  what is it torrens i demanded
breathlessly

   signal-guns the old man answered
hoarsely  but lad-thank heaven-
the lamps a burnin 

  as he spoke the keeper crossed quickly
to the window and looked out i fol-
lowed but peering over his shoulder i
could see nothing at first for water was
trickling down the outside of the-glass
at length however i saw faintly in the
distance a greenish glow that disap-
peared a moment afterward

  the code-the code cried tor-
rens fiercely and turning abruptly he
thrust me aside and rushed to the little
shelf on which  had seen him lay the
book which earlier in the evening he
had assured me was scarcely worth shelf -
room in the lighthouse seizing it now
he held it toward me

   quick with it-to the lantern  he
commanded

  then leading the way to the stairway
he began to draw off his canvas coat

  we mounted the narrow stairway two
or three steps at a bound then having
entered the lantern torrens spread out
his coat in such a manner as to obscure
the light on the south side of the gleam-

ing cone for several seconds with his
face turned toward the sea he held the
coat in this position then with an
abrupt movement he drew it aside

   the book lad-the book  he cried
impatiently

   i placed it in his hands

  a few moments later i saw well out
at sea a little row of yellow lights a
powerful search-light flashed toward us
but this was withdrawn almost imme-
diately

  now-now-look sharp torrens
muttered as if he was speaking to him-
self

  from the point at which the yellow
lights were shining there now glowed
other lights-red green and blue only
one of these was displayed at a time
and while each was several times re-
peated the colors were not displayed in
regular succession as each color ap-
peared torrens recorded it in the back
of the code-book

  the signals continued for about a
minute and a half then they ceased
abruptly torrens dropped the book
and once more held his coat before the
cone scarcely had he done this when
the distant vessels search-light flashed
again toward the lighthouse

  flinging his coat to the floor torrens
picked up the book and with this in his
hands hurried to the stairway calling
to me to follow him

   is it a vessel in distress  i asked
when we found ourselves again in the
watch-room

  torrens made no answer seating
himself at the table he swept to the floor
the checker - board and pieces with a
rapid movement of his arm then he
opened the code-book and forthwith pro-
ceeded to decipher the message that he
had just received

  i watched him anxiously in the ex-
citement attending this new incident of
the night the thundering waves and the
shivering of the lighthouse were forgot-
ten

  at length with a heavy groan torrens
leaned forward and hid his face in his
hands

   in heavens name what is it man 
i demanded laying a hand on one of
the keepers shoulders

  shaking off my hand the old man rose
in the tarantulas skein



and slowly mounted the stairway lead-
ing to the lantern here he raised his
coat from the floor and once more held
it outspread before the cone

  again the search-light found the tower

  torrens withdrew the coat and stepped
back for several seconds he stood im-
movable  then with marked deliberation
he passed the coat twice before the cone

  the searchlight flashed toward us
again then after assuming a vertical po-
sition for several moments it disappeared

  the keeper turned to me

   thats all he muttered brokenly

  i led the way back to the watch-room

  while the mind of the keeper was en-
grossed by the exchange of signals i
realized the importance of allowing him
to proceed without interruption as we
paused beside the table however this
new mystery and the keepers continued
silence excited within me feelings of re-
sentment and distrust

   what ship was that   i demanded
angrily

  the keepers eyes were glaring wildly
as he turned to me abstractedly

    aye aye the devils in it   i heard
him mutter

  my blood ran cold but my brain was
burning as i seized him by the shoulder

   speak man - speak   i cried
 what ship was that 

  by the expression that overspread his
features then one might have thought
that he was only half conscious of my
presence in the room

   it was the gunboat montauk with
sam briartlnvaite aboard he answered
moodily  the lights been out three
hours

chapter vii

an important discovery

  utterly dumfounded i tightened my
grip on torrenss shoulder and incapable
of speech stood staring at his haggard
face

   the lights been out three hours
the old keeper repeated nodding gloom-
ily  aye i knew k before i heard the
signal-guns i  knew it when i found
myself a standin at the bottom of the
lantern-stair

  you knew i muttered hoarsely

   i felt just then as you did tor-
rens said  you know now what it is
to have that queer sinkin feelin i was
tellin you of

  stepping back from the keeper i drew
out my watch

  it was half past ten

  it had been only a few minutes after
seven when torrens and i had seated
ourselves at the watch-room table with
the checker-board between us

  i recalled again that strange smug
mocking smile that was on the face of
captain sam briartlnvaite when i had
seen him last just as i was starting for
new england  to keep the white shoal
light burning every minute of the night
and now under briarthwaites very eyes
george ripley had met his first failure
as a secret-service agent

  for several moments torrens and i
pacing the floor restlessly were silent

   let me have a copy of the montauks
message i said at last

  the big rough hand of the keeper
wrote it out laboriously and gave it to
me i read as follows

    gunboat montauk briarthwaite

    light out three hours ripley there
  one pass-not there two search-light
  then one pass for each man in light-
  house

  is that all he said i asked as
crumpling up the paper i dropped it to
the fioor

   thats all sir but its pretty near
enough i reckon the keeper answered
wearily

  leaving to torrens the task of con-
tinuing the watch i went below to the
living-room there pacing the floor or
sitting on a chair with my face in my
hands i spent the two most miserable
hours i had passed in all my life

  i soon saw the importance of freeing
myself from the terrible sense of mortifi-
cation that had overwhelmed me how-
ever in one respect my commission had
proved a failure for that failure i
must now prepare myself to give a satis-
factory reason and yet this very reason
naturally would involve a solution of the
mystery of the extinguished light

  convinced that in the tower there was
only one living man besides myself it
was clear to me that if the light had


the all-story magazine

been extinguished this night by human	to seek some sort of diversion for my

agency torrens was the culprit	tired thoughts

  during the three hours that the light  if you still have a mind for a game

was out i had been unconscious had	of checkers- i began but the old man

torrens drugged me while i was eating
in the kitchen it was possible of
course hut was it probable

  it seemed to me that it was alto-
gether so

   this proceeding and those that fol-
lowed it would seem to constitute sim-
plicity itself torrens and cowden had
been fellow conspirators cowden be-
lieving that baintree and wilson had dis-
covered his secret had committed suicide
by what means he and torrens had ef-
fected the extinguishment of the light
after they had been removed from the
lighthouse  did not -know but this i
would learn in time

   in order to demonstrate the truth of
my theory i also would have to obtain
possession of the drug which torrens
had used upon me with evidence such
as this in my possession i might succeed
in an effort to compel the old man to
confess the nature of the motive which
had impelled him to commit these crimes

   in the meantime however it was es-
sential that torrens should be given no
reason to suspect that i was preparing
to lay the commission of these crimes to
his charge

   becoming more and more convinced of
his guilt and of the perfect simplicity of
his methods my respect for the man was
constantly increasing he was by long
odds the cleverest actor i had ever
known

   it was after midnight when entering
the watch-room i saw torrens standing
by the southern window looking out
he heard me enter and glanced over his
shoulder but did not speak

    the sea is calming down a bit i
said

    yes he answered half - absently
 the gale has passed an offshore
breeze and an ebbin tide will make all
quiet enough in an hour or so

   glancing round the poorly-furnished
room i saw that the keeper had replaced
the checker-board and pieces on the table
convinced that i had identified the true
culprit and failing to see any prospect
of further action in the course of the next
five or six hours i was  longer loath

interrupted me

  with an impatient shrug of his shoul-
ders he replied

   no sir i have no mind for checkers
now

   well then since twoof us seem to be
unable to maintain a more effective watch
than one i think i will go below and
look over the volumes in your library
the old keeper frowning turned
toward me quickly

   its well for you lad that vou can
take the thing so lightly he said in a
tone of reproach

   ah well i sighed  perhaps we
will have our chance another night
torrens nodded wearily

   perhaps-perhaps he said

  i returned to the living-room but i
was in no state of mind to seek solace in
one of the keepers well-thumbed vol-
umes	

  it was scarcely probable that torrens
would venture to leave the living-room
while he had the watch so i thus was
afforded an excellent opportunity to
search the various rooms below the
watch-room had i found any grounds
for the belief that such a search would
yield evidence of his guilt but i was
satisfied that a search for this must prove
fruitless

  the keeper and i had arrived at the
lighthouse together and it was plain
that if he had had anything of an in-

criminating nature in his possession it
still must be concealed somewhere about
his person i could hope to secure this
only while he was sleeping i expected
to find little else than the vial which had
contained the drug that rendered me un-
conscious

  i had been pacing the room for more
than five minutes when my gaze chanced
to rest on a little piece of torn paper
about an inch square lying  the rim
of a wicker waste-basket near the wall
picking up the paper i saw that on it
were written in black ink the letters

     mr geo

  a glance into the basket showed me
that on the bottom lay nearly two hun-
in the tarantulas skein



dred scraps of paper torn into varying

sizes

  these i carefully removed and placed
between the pages of a book which i
took from one of the shelves of the book-
case

  a search of the room for mucilage
proved fruitless so carrying the book
i went down to the kitchen where i
might find an egg which would serve my
purpose

  having secured the white of an egg
i at once proceeded with the task of
fitting the torn pieces of paper together
in their proper positions and then past-
ing them on sheets of legal which i had
taken with me from the living-room

  i had been thus engaged for about fif-
teen minutes when i realized that i had
made a discovery of the greatest im-
portance

chapter viii

a message from the dead

  the task that now confronted me was
a difficult one i saw that the slips con-
stituted a letter that had been addressed
to me and which had been written close-
ly on five sheets of letter paper fortu-
nately the writer had written on only
one side of each sheet

  nearly three-quarters of an hour
passed before the last slip was in its
proper position

  i now had before me the most remark-
able document on which it ever had
fallen to my lot to gaze-a document
which doubtless having been left on the
living-room table had been found read
and destroyed by cowden shortly before
he had taken his life

  the letter was signed by commander
baintree and read as follows

  mr george ripley

        secret-service agent

   my dear sir-john cowden for-
  merly an assistant keeper at the white
  shoal lighthouse yesterday brought out
  to me a despatch from washington
  which informs me that i am about to be
  relieved of the charge of this light-
  house and that you have been named
  as my successor

    i have prepared a report which i will
  forward to the lighthouse board to-mor-

  row circumstances are such however
  that it will be impossible for me to await
  your arrival here i will therefore
  make a brief report to you of the mis-
  fortunes that have befallen me owing
  to one of these misfortunes i am unable
  to write this communication with my
  own hand so i am dictating it to mr
  wilson

  i have been informed that twice since
my arrival on the shoal the light has
been extinguished i have no personal
knowledge of such disappearances how-
ever

  but this i do know-on each of these
occasions neither wilson nor myself
was able to account for the mysterious
loss of three hours for this fact i am
unable to offer any explanation-the-
oretical or otherwise

  on the subject of a third extinguish-
ment of the light however i have some-
thing to say-something which so far
from enlightening you must only serve
to deepen the mystery

  but before i speak of this which will
give you much food for thought i deem
it my duty to cause you to be on your
guard against a serious physical peril
which now threatens you and your com-
panions

  i refer to the presence in the lower
of a large and singularly ferocious spi-
der i have seen it only once and a
careful search of the lighthouse from
lantern to coal-bin has failed to reveal
its lurking-place

  it was shortly after four oclock yes-
terday afternoon that i saw the miser-
able insect having been on watch all
the night before i lay down on a cot
in the sleeping-room about one oclock
in the afternoon and was soon asleep

  i was wearing only a short-sleeved
undershirt and a pair of trousers at the
time and when i woke a little after
four i was conscious of a tickling sen-
sation just above the elbow of my left
arm believing that this was caused by
contact with the covering of the cot i
altered my position

  as i did so a sharp pain of consider-
able severity darted through the arm
and a moment later i felt something
drop lightly on my chest

  raising my head quickly i beheld an
enormous spider which was looking at
me with a pair of glittering black eyes

  in a moment it had bounded from my
body to the floor then it disappeared at
the head of the staircase which led to
the room below seizing a broom which
was leaning against the wall i followed


the all-story magazine

the fleeing insect as quickly as  could
and as i ran i called to wilson who
hurried down from the living-room

  our search for the spider was in vain

 when cowden arrived with the
washington despatches of which i have
spoken the wound i had received gave
me great pain and the arm was swell-
ing rapidly in a short time  was suf-
fering from a fever

  convinced that the spider belonged to
a species of the tarantula i proceeded
to employ the same remedies that i once
had found effective for the treatment of
the bite of a rattlesnake i cauterized
the wound with a red-hot poker applied
a flaxseed poultice and drank several
copious drafts of whisky

  these remedies afforded me no relief
however and for the last twelve hours
my condition has been growing rapidly
worse

  as i now prepare to describe to you
the most singular of the adventures that
have befallen me since my arrival on
this mysterious shoal i am almost on
the verge of delirium as a result of my
sufferings despite this fact however
my recital of these incidents is not col-
ored by aiy flight of a feverish fancy

  cowden was landed on the shoal by
a fishing vessel about six oclock last
evening he entered the lighthouse
alone and upon giving me the de-
spatches he received permission from
me to pass the night on the shoal

  in view of my enfeebled condition i
was inclined to regard his arrival as dis-
tinctly providential

  shortly after cowdens arrival the
wind began to freshen and by nine
oclock it had assumed the character of
a gale

  the rising tide brought with it a
heavy sea and during the next four
hours the lighthouse received a series
of heavy buffetings

  the storm was at its height about
eleven oclock when lying on my cot
i turned to cowden to ask him to re-
new my poultice at this moment there
camc to our ears a strange jangling
muffled sound that seemed to issue from
one of the rooms above it lasted for
a couple of seconds perhaps then it
ceased abruptly

  cowden starting violently looked up-
ward

  whats that he muttered

   wilson probably has dropped some-
thing on the stone floor of the watch-
room i answered testily  but get
me the poultice

  cowden with a bewildered look on
his face turned slowly toward me he
was about to speak when there fairly
quivered through the lighthouse two of
the most awful long-drawn shrieks i
ever heard then i heard a womans
voice

  jack-jack it cried in heavens
name jack put out the light and stop
the bell 

  for the moment all my physical an-
guish was forgotten shaking with
fright i rose quickly to a sitting posi-
tion on the cot never before had i
seen on human features such an expres-
sion of overwhelming horror as i saw
on cowdens now

  like me the young man was trem-
bling violently both of us were so
dazed and terrified that we were unable
to speak or move

  a heavy wave now smote the light-
house with a force that made it trem-
ble from top to bottom then i heard
the womans voice again it camc to us
much fainter now and seemed to throb
with fear

  the light jack-put out the light
the monster sees us and is coming-
coming for heavens sake put out the
light anti stop the bell 

  thrill after thrill passed through me
as i leaped from the bed to the floor
breathing heavily and with his head
thrust forward cowden rushed up the
stairway moving weakly i followed

  when reached the living - room i
stopped and listened at first all above
me was still then i heard the shuffling
of feet

  i tried to call to wilson but my
throat and lips were so parched that i
was unable to utter a single syllable

  as i started to ascend the stairway
leading to the watch-room i saw that
the atch-room light had been extin-
guished too feeble to proceed farther
i retreated to a chair in the living-room
on this i sank inertly and waited
then i suddenly realized that the fog-
bell had ceased tolling and that the
lantern-light was out

  hov long i sat there i do not know
at length however my pain became so
agonizing that i fainted when i came
to myself i was lying on my cot and
wilson was bending over me daylight
was streaming in through the window
and the waves had ceased to thunder

  strangely enough of the mysterious
voice or of the extinguishment of the
light and the silencing of the bell wil-
son appeared to know nothing
in the tarantulas skein



    he said that he and cowden hearing
  me moaning had descended from the
  watch-room and found me lying  the
  floor beside a chair in the living-room

    both of my companions professed to
  believe that i was the victim of an
  hallucination due to my illness

    cowden failed to conceal from me the
  fact that a deep impression had been
  made upon his mind by my recital how-
  ever

    several times i saw a pallor over-
  spread his face and twice or thrice since
  then i have heard him muttering inco-
  herently to himself

    this is all i have to tell you now

    a boat landed at the shoal this morn-
  ing and a young man brought to the
  lighthouse several letters addressed to
  us at the charlesport post-office why
  he should have done this i do not
  know for the letters were quite unim-
  portant and the seas still were fairly
  heavy

    he made a search of the lighthouse
  for the miserable spider but was unable
  to find it he said his name was david
  rensior wilson wanted me to go
  back with the fellow to charlesport in
  order to secure medical attention but i
  foolishly declined to do so

    since then i have regretted my de-
  cision and realizing that if my life is
  to be saved i must consult a physician
  at once i am preparing to leave the
  shoal it is possible that wilson who
  will accompany me will be able to sec
  you before you put off for the shore

    with best wishes for the success of
  your mission i remain

yours very truly

henry baintree
commander u s n

  having carefully reread this astonish-
ing letter i raised the sheets and slipped
them into one of the pockets of my coat

  that part of the letter which had to
do with the tarantula and the effects of
its bite would if true explain the de-
parture of baintree and wilson from the
tower

  but was it true the  rest of the
letter-with its description of the cries
of the mysterious woman and its refer-
ence to the singular lapse of memory in
the cases of wilson and cowden-
obviously was so highly colored by an
overworked imagination that i was in-
clined to doubt the truth of all

  yet as i reflected more carefully on
the matter the story concerning the

tarantula did not seem so improbable
after all the great spider might have
been taken into the lighthouse in a bunch
of bananas or have drifted to the shoal
on some object that had been thrown
overboard from a vessel bound north-
ward from the tropics

  moreover the finding of the flaxseed
poultice and the poker seemed to corrobo-
rate the writers account of his suffer-
ings

  it was also clear that i could not con-
sistently regard as incredible baintrees
assertion that twice while the light had
been extinguished he and wilson were
unable to account for all that had oc-
curred during a period of three hours for
did i not find myself in a similar pre-
dicament 

  writh regard to the account of the third
extinguishment however it would have
to be considered that the narrator was
manifestly the victim of a fever that in-
dicated the approach of delirium

  on this occasion it would appear that
of the three men in the lighthouse bain-
tree was the only one who had been able
to retain a recollection of the incidents
attending the extinguishment of the light
unless however one was prepared to
recognize as a fact the presence in the
lighthouse of some distinctively super-
natural agency or of a ventriloquist who
was able to hypnotize the inmates for a
period of three hours no serious con-
sideration could be given to baintrees
extraordinary assertions

  according to baintrees account the
lights both in the watch-room and the
lantern had been extinguished by cow-
den himself if this was true the action
must have taken place in the presence of
wilson but from the lips of- wilson
there appeared to have come no word of
protestation

  i rose from the table at which i hact
been seated and was in the act of casting
into a garbage receptacle all that re-
mained of the white of the egg which
had served me as paste when a sharp
muffled sound coming from one of the
rooms above chilled my blood and my
heart seemed to cease its beating

  the sound though louder was simi-
lar to that which i had heard when cow-
den had sent the fatal bullet into his
brain


the all-story magazine

  rushing to the stairway i mounted it
quickly

  through the sleeping and living
rooms  made my way with nervous
breathless haste at last i reached the
watch-room

  on the floor with his head against the
blanket-covered feet of the dead cowden
lay torrens-moving weakly and with
a still smoking revolver grasped tightly
in his hand

  overwhelmed by a conflict of the most
powerful emotions that may come to any
man  recoiled from the sight that met
my view then with a feeble effort the
old keeper struggling to a sitting pos-

ture began to raise the revolver to his
head

  with a-hoarse cry i leaped toward
him and seized his hands in a moment
i had secured possession of the weapon

  as i started to draw away torrens
grasped my coat  was about to glance
at the old mans face when a sudden
movement of that part of the blanket
that lay over covvdens head attracted
and held my attention

  more and more violently it stirred
then from it rolled a blackish palpitating
thing which as it struck the floor went
skimming and bounding toward the stair

  it was the tarantula

            to be c o n t i n d 

shirt annie

      by frank condon

  h a lady of the flat-iron had
  thoughts about and words
  with a perfectly good nobleman

i f it wasnt for the surprising things
i that are always happening and if

   it wasnt for the novelty of the job
and the constant need of the money
and if i had the knack and the love of
loafing like some people said shirt
annie mopping her tired face with her
apron  id certainly give up this job
look at this now

  shirt annie held up a white shirt with
purple stripes

   look  she commanded turning the
shirt round  what dye make of that
mag and lil examined the garment
attentively

  it had come steaming and damp from
the mangle and shirt annies narrow
ironing-table was its next stop after
she had smoothed it out with the heavy
iron and stiffened its florid bosom with
starch it would be wrapped around a
pasteboard that they use in laundries
to simulate a mans spinal column and
the red-faced parcel-boy in front would
tie it into a chaste bundle

  it would then be piled on the shelves
with other bundles of fresh-laundered
things and eventually some male person
would come along and clasp it to his
bosom with a cheery smile

   its a kind of a nutty thing aint it
mused shirt annie holding the purple-
striped shirt aloft

   very odd admitted mag mag
was the mangier  very odd

   rather foreign i should say put in
lil lil ironed cuffs socks suspenders
ties and miscellaneous apparel

   whose is it dye know   scratching
the freshly ironed shirt with a pensive
forefinger  he aint a big man judg-
ing by the size number fourteen and
a half neck alberts shirts is sixteen
and you know lil albert aint what you
could really call a big man

  lil took the shirt nearer the window
and gazed with critical eye and pursed
lip upon its royal chest

  it was one of those shirts invented by
a nameless fiend during the spanish in-
quisition to torture men before the hot-
iron and eye-gouging ceremonials it
split down the back and it split down the
front it was the kind of shirt that a
man gets into by lying on the floor and
sneaking the collar-buttons into their
buttonholes before the wretched thing
shirt annie	

can biscct itself and flop apart like a
split shad

  in front and on either side of the
dividing line were two designs stamped
into the material they were similar
and were so placed in order to be visible
after the collar and cravat were put on
the twin design was a brilliant green
oval containing a golden fleece

  it looks something like a worm in a
nut commented mag interestedly

   youre a nut answered shirt annie
tartly  that gold thing is a fleece
dont you know a fleece when you see
it

  mag retired to her mangle and lil to
her table and shirt annie resumed the
difficult duties that gave her a name in
the parlance of laundries she hummed
softly during the afternoon and never
once did the thoughtful frown leave her
perspiring forehead

   now where did i see that thing
before she argued i bet you ive
seen that i know i saw it on some
shirts last week but i know i saw it
somewhere else and im trying to think
and for the life of me i cant recall it
and why is it when youre thinking your
hardest- by gee now i know 

  shirt annie dropped her iron so sud-
denly that it fell to the floor and missed
the off toe on her left foot by a fleas
whisper she pounced upon the silent
shirt and stared at the device

   as sure as im irish its the same
thing aint that funny to think of
him having his shirts done up here why
she lives somewhere round here too
thats awful funny i think ill tell the
girls no i wont im going to just
keep this to myself and-well if that
aint funny 

  when in the course of human events
an english earldom begins to run for
sweeny and the instalment-houses are
sending up insulting letters every mon-
day  and when the senior earl cant lend
the junior earl the family watch to hock
because its in hock already and when
the hunting-pack slims down to one bru-
nette dog and that an iron dog in the
front yard and when the butler has but-
tled along for seven or eight years and
quits suddenly over night taking away
the dining-room rug in part payment of
cash arrears due and not paid and when

the proud name that has flickered down
through the ages from the time william
the conqueror put the bee on old eng-
land and is about to appear as the
caudal-appendage on a position-wanted
ad in the london times-it behooves
somebody round the place to put on his
behoovers and start something that will
eventually produce cash lots of cash
warm trickling and ready to spend

  this particular earldom was set down
in a valley about nine hours out of lon-
don and it smelled of hyacinths and
motor-cars it had a name that took up
four lines of pica type in burkes peer-
age including two hyphens

  the principal son and heir which
would naturally be his young earlets
was potheringham orby guensinborough
smolley and his calling-cards folded on
a perforation to get it all in young
orby-his friends called him orby-al-
ways lived in london because he liked
steam heat and his respected sire wouldnt
be in the way of perpetually borrowing
a two-dollar bill from him

  when he suddenly received a serious
communication from the old gentleman
calling his attention to the devastated
condition of the family check-book he
was  peeved not to say irritated

  you arc probably wondering what this
credit mans survey of an english nobles
home has to do with shirt annie and
the laundry up  sixty-sixth street
new york were all that way no-
body can wait these days

  young orby went down to worcester-
shire on a fast express talked the mat-
ter over with his male parent and tele-
graphed for a ticket to america in
eighteen hours he was kissing everybody
good-by and riding down to the station
in the familys last dog-cart wondering
which old friend of his could introduce
him to an american millionaires only
daughter because he wanted to marry
her and annex the needed tauzoids
thats how the thing starts to hook up
with shirt annie

  leave it to the sunday papers par-
ticularly the parts that are printed in
red green and blue with dragons all
round the margins and mosquitoes the
size of an ox shooting their cruel stems
into a childs arm

  they heard about lord orby or earl


the all-story magazine

orby some of them called him count
orby in spite of the fact that there are
no counts in england unless they sneak
in late at night it took the astute lon-
don correspondents just twelve hours to
fathom the whole mystery of why earl
orby sailed for new york they knew
he couldnt sail across the thames river
if he had to finance the expedition un-
aided and they decided that some worthy
object in his exploration had induced the
pawnbrokers to unclasp some more gold

 the papers were full of it in new
york the sunday supplements went into
the matter thoroughly they printed
photographs of the young earl shooting
elephants from a balloon riding to
hounds in a pearl-gray necktie fighting
a duel at eighty paces with a dachshund-
revolver and rowing with the oxford
crew

  they gave detailed measurements
showing his chest expansion the diameter
of his left leg the height he would have
been if he had been born a chinaman
and the type of paper-cutter he used

  then they published the pictures of the
ancestral domains and figured that if
stood on end they would be higher than
the singer building and the metropoli-
tan tower combined all investigations
ended with the announcement that earl
orby was coming over to wed an ameri-
can heiress

  they gave the name of the heiress and
in this respect each paper assumed a
different policy and stuck to it with that
intense loyalty that marks our american
journalism the system followed by
new york papers in such cases is to
select a name from a list of unmarried
american women and hang onto it until
the day before the wedding if they
guess rignt nobody cares if they dont
ditto

  and never did the sunday papers print
that story without showing in colors the
lamily arms of the earl smolley which
happened to be a golden fleece within a
green oval

  shirt annie read the sunday papers
immediately after helping her mother
with the breakfast dishes when she
first saw the pictures of that defunct
british possession she decided to read
the story every sunday it came out and
and follow it until earl orby fought his

way into the church with his blushing
bride through a mob of wild-eyed ameri-
can women sightseers who dont care a
snap for nobility or royalty

  naturally she noticed the crest twas
a striking thing stowed up there in the
corner of the page directly above the
picture of the earl killing a python with
a walking-stick

  you can see why shirt annie gasped
with maidenly astonishment when she
suddenly recollected in the laundry that
warm afternoon that the crest on the
purple-striped shirt was nothing else than
the royal arms of earl potheringham
orby guensinborough smolley

 here was romance for you here
was coincidence in the laundry that af-
ternoon the boss spoke sharply to shirt
annie several times all because the lat-
ters mind was running on the earl and
simply wouldnt get down to the business
of massaging the wrinkles out of mens
corsages

  but the next day

  words are but puerile things to de-
scribe what happened the next day while
the golden fleece within the green oval
excited mild curiosity the card that fell
out of a ladys silken thingumajig on
the table across from shirt annie started
a mental disturbance that assumed ty-
phoonic proportions and nobody in that
blessed laundry shared the excitement
except shirt annie

   whats this card doing here  asked
little miss kane holding it up between
moist fingers

  whose is it queried shirt annie
absently

   it says maud livingstone mulreavy
on it answered miss kane tossing the
pasteboard bit across the room

   must be mauds then said shirt
annie picking it up

  she looked at it once and in a flash
she remembered the name it was the
card of the maud livingstone mulreavy
five newspapers had united upon maud
as the american millionairess destined to
become the bride of earl orby shirt
annie was dumfounded stricken speech-
less

  she turned the white card over and
over in her hand what had been co-
incidence before now became miracle it
was a shock to find oneself laundering
shirt annie



the shirts of earl orby but to know that
the girl beside one was doing up things
for maud livingstone mulreavy made
reason to sway on her throne

  after that shirt annie worked in a
trance pleated shirts were scorched and
attached cuffs frayed under her merciless
iron too much romance suddenly de-
posited upon the unsuspecting head of a
laundry-girl simply tears her mental
processes wide open and wo be unto the
luckless garments of men that come her
way

  in sheridans laundry-it was sheri-
dans though  mention has been made
thus far because of the advertising feature
of the information-the cashier was an
angular woman of thirty-six years who
hated rats-wire spring or natural hair-
and who consequently wore her deci-
mated locks in a neat and compact knot
on the starboard bow of her serious head
she didnt particularly hate shirt annie
so she delivered to her the information
that the owner of the shirts with the
golden fleece and the green oval was a
tallish young man who looked like a
foreigner and who wore a very large
seal-ring on the third finger of his left
hand

  shirt annie couldnt remember reading
about the seal-ring in the sunday papers
but she attributed it to an oversight on
the part of the editors she began to
watch the front door

  he came in tuesday morning at nine
forty-three oclock smoking a cork-tipped
cigarette

  shirt annie received a brief wireless
from the cashier which read  here he
is how do you like him 

  he was rather a disappointment the
earl looked like an american citizen
working somewhere  duane street
probably in the shoe business who had
obviously neglected to shave his clothes
fitted him neatly as clothes lit all ameri-
can men he had a short mustache that
corresponded with the one in the pictures
and thats about as far as shirt annie
could trace a resemblance any one who
knows anything about newspaper photog-
raphy will understand this

  in the excitement of the moment shirt
annie burned her hand and emitted a
feminine yowl of pain whereat the earl
looked at her with interest in fact he

    	s

stared and although sheridans was
somewhat dimly lighted he saw that she
was distinctly pretty

  several times after that shirt annie
sav the earl and each time he cast an
approving eye upon her once it was
 the street as the girl was hurrying
along to the shop she knew that he was
watching but she modestly kept her eyes
upon the ground and scurried along he
certainly knew how to dress thought
shirt annie and he had an air about
him

  lucky maud livingstone she won-
dered what the palace in england looked
like

  some of the cars on columbus avenue
run  a schedule and some of them run
by whim shirt annie was waiting for
one of the latter when a mans walking-
stick dropped with a metallic thud beside
her and a voice said 

   i beg your pardon miss

  young men who have lived in new
york will recognize this five-word sen-
tence it does yeoman duty day and
night young ladies will know it too
and if they blush it is because of
memories

  shirt annie turned and there beside
her hat in hand stood earl pothering-
liam orby guensinborough smolley she
stared at him silently and slightly fright-
ened

  he was speaking to her hurriedly and
somewhat lamely if she could have
heard  but she couldnt hear because her
eyes were fastened upon a golden fleece
within a green oval directly underneath
his collar on the white shirt with the
purple stripes the shirt which her own
hands had made immaculate

   im awfully sorry to speak to you
without an introduction the earl was
saying but ive noticed you frequently
of late i fact ive seen you so often
that it seems i almost know you i know
its forward on my part but ive been
simply longing to meet you and im
driven to this informal way because i
cant think of any other youll forgive
me wont you  

  the earl put as much pathos into the
latter portion of his remark as any one
could desire

  at first shirt annie was flustered
then she thought of the quality of the


the all-story magazine

man who was talking what kind of a
country was england did the men
over there think they could land upon
our hospitable shores and address them-
selves without an introduction to every
girl who by chance happened to pass
their way

  just because he was an earl did this
man think he had special license what
would the proud nobility of england
think of such behavior what would
maud livingstone mulreavy the bride-
to-be think if she should hear that her
fiance was gadding about upper new
york speaking to laundry-girls

  at the thought of maud shirt annie
smiled the earl smiled too he saw
his work smoothing out before him shirt
annie reached down and snapped open
her eight-inch crocodile purse and drew
from it a small piece of pasteboard with
printing on it

  she looked the earl directly in the eye
as she handed him the card and waited
for him to quail

   perhaps you recognize me she said
trying to talk icily

  shirt annie had read that young ladies
always speak icily when addressed by
strangers

  the earl read the card without emo-
tion

   its a pretty name-almost as pretty
as its owner but what a long one
now i should like maud mulreavy just
by itself i never did like three names
for a girl where did you get the liv-
ingstone part and who made vou put
it in 

  shirt annie looked at the earl in
amazement she started to speak but
words failed her the earl remained si-
lent holding the card daintily between
his fingers and smiling at her cheerfully

   dont you recognize that name  she
finally said with a painful effort at self-
control  dont you know maud liv-
ingstone mulreavy

  if i do said the earl i hope to
die you arent a chorus-girl at night
are you 

  shirt annie stared at him stupidly
from his smiling countenance her gaze
descended to his necktie and rested upon
the golden fleece within the green oval

  whats wrong with my tie he
asked following her glance

   nothing arent you earl orby-
earl potheringham orby guensinbor-
ough smolley

  gome again please

  arent you the earl arent you
going to marry miss mulreavy

   i think some one is kidding me said
the young man  and if its a joke why
send over my end so i can laugh too
but if you really want to know im not
the earl smothingham schootzenborough
gazooks or any other earl nor am i
king alfonso nor the king of prussia
nor carrie nation outlaw tracy nor
christy mathewson of the new york
giants

   im plain mister john b forbes of
one hundred and forty-fifth street
new york city free and untrammeled
here for the pursuit of life liberty and
happiness till death do us part now
come on young lady quick with the
answer

  shirt annie still kept her eyes upon the
insignia of rank that snuggled on either
side of the young mans cravat

   you wear the arms of the earl she
said  where did you get them  
arms

   this

  shirt annie poked a stiffened finger at
the brilliant green oval and the golden
fleece

   oh that  you dont mean to say-
well ill be jiggered say do you mean
to say that youve doped it out you saw
it in the laundry didnt you well ill
be jiggered 

   where did you get it   went on
shirt annie mercilessly

   little girl said the young man  i
work for a cigarette company with eigh-
teen hundred stores in america every
employee is loyal at present im one
of their employees

   every employee manifests his loyalty
by wearing the trade-mark of the com-
pany on some part of his anatomy in-
stead of being branded with it i wear
it on my shirt

   this laying his finger on the green
oval and the golden fleece  is the trade-
mark of the smith cigarette company
and im the clerk of the forty-eighth
street store

  you take this car dont you i
thought so ill see you home

synopsis of previous chapters

in the very early morning marjory roland leans out of her motor-car and asks barry
ellison correspondent to aid her being adventurous the young man consents and
is taken by a roundabout route to a country-house where he is told he must imper-
sonate one jack rutherford and patch up a quarrel with the latters sick uncle benjamin
gordon barrys suspicions are roused by their stealthy approach to the house also by
voices heard in the dark a dwarfish person mr hardston a lawyer supposedly the
employer of miss roland leads him to gordons bedroom where the sick man asks him
unintelligible questions later barry having been drugged wards off sleep long enough

to give to another strange girl i-ieien cior
day realizing that he has been in a house
matter drop when he receives a telephone
eleven oclock in the evening	

       chapter xii

         y poes park

rfevv inquiries as to the location
of poes park gave barry his
directions and a little before
ten oclock he set out

  he was absolutely in the dark as to
whom he was to meet but with con-
siderable anticipation he took the train
for fordham he knew that a womans
voice had spoken to him over the tele-
phone and he knew the coming meeting
must be a continuation of the previous
nights adventure

  he had wondered if it could have
been marjory roland who had called
him up but had decided that it was not
she with whom he had spoken over the
telephone he hardly knew helen gor-
dons voice well enough to be sure that
it was not hers and yet he had missed
the soft plaintiveness in the tone

   whatever it is it promises some new
development he commented as he
turned up the hill from the station in
a few blocks the populated door-steps
were left behind and in a few more he
was traveling a rather poorly lighted
road

began june all-story mae

ion a paper ner uncic nas given mm iexc
divided against itself he is about to let the
message asking him to go to poes park at

    single detached houses lined the right
 side of the street and as he gained the
 top of the hill he made out close to
 one of them a little white cottage on
 the tin sign tacked high under the gable
 was the melancholy outline of a raven

   the corner of barrys mouth went up
 in a smile for an instant he surveyed
 the little building where real tales full
 of the weird had found birth then
 turning about he noted the small patch
 of ground across the street which bore
 the name of the dead poet

     a very fine place to go  with the
 adventure he remarked to the silent
 cottage glancing over his shoulder
  if by chance your astral body edgar
 allan is hovering round you can add
 fuel to the fire and by the bye you
 might it is a fair beginning

   he moved across the street

    it has interest in the running-to
 date by all rights it should go 
 but please if the gods be willing toss
 in a little daylight and let me have a
 peep at the trail

   selecting the darkest spot he could
 find he threw himself on the ground
 it was still a little before the appointed
 hour and he was prepared to wait

  z i n e  single copies  cents


the all-story magazine

  eleven oclock came and went and
he sat up cross-legged on the turf no
one had passed save a mounted police-
man and the impression gradually be-
gan to form itself in his mind that some
one had played a practical joke on him

  he had not however mentioned his
previous nights experience to any one
it was hardly possible that davis or
sutton had gathered enough from what
he had said to them to think they saw
an opportunity of amusing themselves
at his expense he was getting a bit
provoked at being kept waiting so long

  at half past eleven he rose and
stretched himself ready to believe that
he had made the trip for nothing as
he crossed the park he saw a figure com-
ing down the road he stepped into
the shadow of a tree and waited

  on came the figure and as recog-
nition came to barry his heart leaped
with pleasure he had not counted on
it being helen gordon who had called
him up

  crossing the grass quickly he met her
in the middle of the street

   so it was you he said

  she glanced up at him a faint timid
smile upon her lips her large dark
eyes shone

   yes she faltered while her lips
parted and the smile on them grew  i
am late i know but i couldnt help it

  it was very evident to barry that she
was laboring under a good deal of ex-
citement so he shifted his eyes from her
face

   its not so very late he answered
 i suppose -lie turned and smiled at
her- you want to ask me a few ques-
tions the best place round here is one
of those benches shall we sit down  

   if you do not mind

  they moved across to the park and sat
down in silence barry leaned forward
elbow  knee and began poking the
gravel with his foot he felt a bit
embarrassed and was a little at a loss
how to begin the conversation before he
could speak the girl turned toward him

   i dont know mr ellison just how
to begin

  barry looked at his companion and
smiled whimsically

   those are just the words miss ro-
land used he said

  the girl drew back sharply and sat
straight and rigid her eyes fixed in a
searching look on barrys face her ex-
pression suddenly became one of distrust

   i guess perhaps barry hastened
 if you dont mind i will explain a
little first i didnt get much of a chance
last night now did i  

   no you did not the girl agreed
 that is why i called you up and asked
you to meet me here i felt i must
talk with you

   yes i was pretty badly off last
night barry went on his eyes shifting
to the ground  i really am not sure
what i said or did at the time i think
i knew-but it is hard to remember

   i tried to rouse you i shook you
and pulled you up onto the sofa but
you would not wake then i heard a
noise at the door and i slipped out onto
the balcony

   i see barry agreed   and did any
one come into the room  

   yes i watched at first i thought
i would wait but if i had they would
have known how i got out of my room
and then i thought i could do no good
i watched from the balcony if they
had been intending you any harm i
would have called out

  he looked at his companion

   that was very good of you

  i do not think so you should not
feel so now i think i would have
called out but really i waited to see
whether i could find out anything about
you  wanted to place you-to learn
if i could who you were and why you
came to the house from what you said
to me i thought perhaps you did not
know miss roland or mr hardston
very well you spoke as if you would
be willing to help

   to be sure barry nodded as the
other stopped her half-timid half-ex-
cited explanation  and what did you
find out

   not very much she shook her
head  i saw mr hardston and miss
roland come into the room they
didnt seem surprised to find you
asleep

   i judge not barry agreed dryly

   what i did see made me think i
had understood you correctly-that you
were not in league with them
helen of troubles



  so you decided to call me up and
find out what i had done

   i thought i could do that it
seemed the only thing for me to do if
i was to find out anything

  to be sure but what did mr
hardston and miss roland do

   they searched your pockets for
something and when they failed to find
it mr hardston stormed up and down
the room oh he is terrible when he
flies into a rage  the girl shuddered

   then miss roland got angry with
him as she does sometimes i heard
her tell him he must have been mis-
taken about something that was after
they had looked through all your pock-
ets

   that is just about what i thought
had happened barry nodded  you
see they were after that paper i gave
you in some way they must have seen
mr gordon hand it to me perhaps
hardston slipped into the room and was
behind the- screen

  he looked at helen gordon in-
quiringly

  she shook her head

    dont know im sure

   well they knew in some way that
i had that paper it was lucky you
came along just as you did and i gave
it to you

   you saw my uncle   the girl ques-
tioned

   to be sure i did you dont know
after all what i did or how i came into
the affair except what i told you last
night  

   and that was very vague the girl
answered

   i have no doubt it was barry
agreed with a wry smile  well to
begin with-but then perhaps you want
to ask me some questions just go
ahead and ask whatever you wish ill
give you all the information i can

   i hardly know what to ask helen
said speaking slowly while a frown
gathered on her forehead  i know so
little myself i have  chance to talk
with my uncle and he has never told me
anything i thought about you all day
and it just seemed to me that i must
see you and find out what you knew

   so i asked you to meet me here i
got hold of the telephone for a minute

while mr hardston and miss roland
were out in the garden then i had to
wait until it was dark and every one was
asleep they watch me so if i hadnt
found that the trellis outside my window
was strong enough to bear my weight i
couldnt get out at all they keep the
house locked and alarms on all the
lower windows

  barry pursed up his lips

   we both seem to be very much in
the dark he began  i know nothing
at all i am a newspaper man miss
gordon i reached new york yester-
day last night my adventures began
and he told the girl his story

  her occasional interjections made it
clear that the trip in the motor-car had
been purposely roundabout and mislead-
ing and started a new train of suspi-
cion in regard to whether benjamin
gordons illness was from natural or
artificial causes

  after he had finished the girl looked
away and was silent for a long time
barry waited patiently for her to speak
in the position in which they sat her pro-
file stood out against the dim light of
the distant street-lamp even as it had
been marked by the early dawn when
lie had first seen her on the balcony

  her presence increased the spark of
interest that had first flamed up within
him when he heard her voice in the
garden

  he was really  nearer a solution of
the puzzle their conversation had add-
ed no great amount of information but
he was more certain than ever that he
wanted to help the girl

  after a little while she spoke

   can it be that my uncle has become
distrustful of mr hardston i never
heard him say anything against him but
then i do not think he would to me for
he knows that i never liked him do
you think he could have asked my cousin
to find out something which would
either confirm or disprove his doubt 

   he had beyond a question asked
your cousin to look up some one for him
who that some one is i do not know
while barry was quite ready to agree
with his companion that it was hard-
ston of whom benjamin gordon was
suspicious he did not feel that he
should allow his personal prejudice


the all-story magazine

against the little lawyer to govern his
opinion

   it must have something to do with
the invention my uncle has worked on
so long helen suggested wearily

   your cousin would know barry
put in

   if i could find my cousin i have
wanted to see him but have had no
chance since we went to mr hardstons
while we were in town it was not so
bad but during the last three months it
has become unbearable i have no one
upon whom i can depend-except my
cousin and he-

  she stopped and glanced doubtfully at
barry

   let me find your cousin for you i
can get hold of him in some way and
arrange for you to see him when he
knows that you want him he will come
to you quickly

  will he helen gordons voice
suddenly -rang with scorn and barry
thought of what she had said to him the
night before when she had taken him
for rutherford  i do not think he
would even trouble himself

   but you say you want to see him
barry questioned

   because there is no one else i do
not know what he could do or whether
he would be willing to help us at all
perhaps i am letting my dislikes sway
my feelings there is i fear nothing
to do but await my uncles recovery
we may go back home then

   there is no one else to whom you
could appeal   barry asked

   no one i have always lived with
my uncle except when i was at college
 there is the paper barry suggest-
ed  which your uncle gave me that
should be given to your cousin should it
not it said something about his des-
troying a package

   yes her voice had grown lifeless
as well as tired  i suppose it should
she rose slowly

   i will have to find him in somo way
and give it to him then i can ask him
if he will not take us away i could go
of course but i must not leave my
uncle

  barry rose slowly and stood looking
down on his companion

   wont you let me look up your

cousin for you i have come into this
thing in an odd way but perhaps that
was intended

  intended helen gordon ques-
tioned in doubt

   by fate barry smiled

  the girl laughed and turned along
the path

   let us walk a way i can think bet-
ter perhaps

  they crossed the park and turned
down the road in the direction from
which she had come after a little
while barry glanced at her

   dont feel that i am too persistent
or that i want to meddle but i should
like to help you if i may i could find
your cousin and tell him what i have
done-i feel that i should do that-and
then arrange to have him meet you

   i dont want to bother you mr el-
lison and i do not-please dont mis-
understand me-want to bring a stranger
into my uncles affairs when perhaps
i should not do so i hope you will
understand 

   i do miss gordon yet i do feel
that i should find your cousin and tell
him what i have done dont let the
point of bothering me make you hesitate
i am naturally a bit interested having
some curiosity but more than that i
want to help you

 help me-why

   because i think i should i have
helped one side in this matter let me
be of some service to the other-yourself
-and thus offset what harm if any i
have done

   it is very good of you to offer

   it would be very good of you to let
me do something

   i have no one the girl spoke more
to herself than to barry  i do not
really see what harm it could do

   it could do no harm at all barry
put in  i will find your cousin and
just arrange for him to meet you you
can talk with him and give him that bit
of paper i will of course drop out
when you desire it and if it is neces-
sary to add forget whatever i have
learned

  the girl did not answer for some
time at last she turned to barry and
inclined her head

   i will accept your very kind offer
helen of troubles



mr ellison for i feel that  must see
my cousin though i fear that it will
do no good

   it can do no harm

   no but you will have a hard time
finding him i do not know his ad-
dress

    i will get track of him just the same
oh yes tell me what are his habits-
that will help

  really mr ellison- the girl
stopped the look on her face was
one that indicated her displeasure at the
question

    the reason i ask is that i saw a man
who looked a little like me to-day now
to be frank with you miss gordon he
was with an individual who was pointed
out to me as a gambler that is why
i asked the question

   i think that was the reason why my
uncle and cousin quarreled sometimes
mr rutherford has gambled i heard
my uncle say so

    and a description if you can give
it he added

  ihe girl turned and looked barry-
over very carefully  i do not think
you look very much like him my cousin
is as tall as you and yet his face is
heavier he has dark hair while
yours-

   is red barry laughed  it shows
my irish ancestry

  for the first time since they had met
helen gordon broke into a light laugh
it sounded far better to barry than the
serious mood

   mr rutherford has a scar close to
his right eye it is a little one cres-
cent-shaped

    ill find him with that information
barry said  and when i do what
shall i say to him  

   tell him that i have a paper from
my uncle for him and that i must sec
him

   and how shall  explain my connec-
tion in the matter  

  the girl considered for a moment
 would you mind just saying you were
an old friend that you had known me
in the west that may not be the best
thing to do but  cannot think of any-
thing else now

   an old friend barry smiled  i
will tell him that

   but how am i to see him   the girl
suddenly demanded turning on barry

   ill arrange for him to meet you any-
where you say

  helen shook her head  i do not
know what to do about that i want
to see him somewhere where miss ro-
land would not be around

   do you ever come to town barry
questioned

  the inquiry brought a bitter laugh to
helen gordons lips barry looked at
her in surprise

   when i go to town miss roland
goes along they seem afraid to let me
out of their sight i really think they
want to keep me and my cousin apart
 all the more need for your meeting
him

   but i do not see how

   i think i can find your cousin to-
night i have a feeling that the man i
saw to-day is mr rutherford and if it
turns out that he is i will see him before
morning

  if i could see you then to-mor-
row  

   you say miss roland would come
to town with you

  if i should say that i was going
shopping she would announce that she
had planned to go and that i could go
with her in the car

   tell her you do not care to do so
 then she or mr hardston would
say that they must speak to mr gordon
when we first came to new york my
uncle made me promise not to go out
without miss roland he has straifge
ideas about a large city really he treats
me like a child i put up with every-
thing rather than have him worried
while he is ill

   i tell you what you do barry put
in quickly  come in to-morrow with
miss roland and when you are in some
large store slip away from her i will
meet you somewhere and let you know
whether i have found your cousin or
not

   oh i should like to  the girl
cried eagerly and barry felt that she had
shown him more of her real self in that
one speech than in the whole conversa-
tion they had had  i should just like
to give her the slip and let her worry a
little


the all-story magazine

   we can do it barry went on  you
go to some store where there is sure to
be a crowd ill be there and when
you get into the crowd about a counter i
will step up and speak to miss roland
she will i dare say be a bit surprised
to see me and while she is recovering
you can slip out the side door take
anibergs on twenty-first street when
you go out walk across to fifth ave-
nue and i will meet you there as soon
as i can get away from miss roland it
wont take me long

  the girl clapped her hands in delight
 that is fine it will work nicely
i will be here about twelve oclock

   and i will i trust have some news
of your cousin i will try and arrange
to have you meet him that afternoon

   you do rush things through 
helen exclaimed with a smile

  she had stopped and now held out
her hand

   i turn off here and go through this
wood-path it is all very kind of you
mr ellison i do not know how i can
thank you

   dont try barry laughed  you
are giving me a great deal of pleasure i
assure you but let me gp with you to
the house

  the girl shook her head

   michael is waiting for me down the
path good-by until to-morrow

  barry took the little hand held out to
him

   good-by he said with a rare smile
 we will have the whole matter straight-
ened out in a day

   i feel as if we might-with your
help she looked into his eyes for just
a moment and turned down the path

  for a long time barry stood silently
regarding the spot where she had disap-
peared

chapter xiii

through guarded wavs

  finally he turned and with his
hands thrust deep down into his pockets
moved slowly back along the road by
the time he had passed poes park and
bestowed an amused smile upon the
white cottage across the way he had
nodded twice at nothing apparently

  it was very evident that he was
amused but it was an amusement
touched with real pleasure and coupled
to it was a feeling of deep interest and
sympathy

  at a corner store he found a tele-
phone and after calling a couple of
numbers got in touch with sam her-
rick

  asking his friend to meet him at his
hotel in half an hour barry boarded
the elevated and was on his way back
down-town curled up in a corner seat
he fell to a renewed consideration of the
whole affair

  he did not feel that he had gained a
great deal of information from his talk
with helen gordon but he did know
on which side his full sympathies were
enlisted he even began to feel a little
jealous of rutherford

  when he found that individual as he
had  doubt he would he supposed that
he would have to drop out of the affair
once and for all he could hardly see
what further need there would be for
him with rutherford ready to help
that part of the matter he did not like
in the least

  he got down at twenty-third streat
and hurried across town herrick was
waiting for him in the hotel lobby

    well his friend demanded  whats
up your voice sounded over the phone
as if the affairs of nations depended
upon my meeting you

  herrick was a little overlarge - in
fact rather fat-and his huge frame
shook when he chuckled

   hope i didnt put you out by my
summons it is a bit important to my
way o thinking barry lowered his
voice  do you remember the woman
you pointed out to me at luncheon-lee
larson  

   sure herricks small eyes nar-
rowed and he continued to laugh softly

   do you happen to know where her
establishment is barry questioned

   did you keep me from going home
just because you wanted to take a fling
at the wheel nice reason

   there is a man who may be playing
there to-night i just want to see if
he has a scar  his face barry an-
swered carelessly

  herrick stopped chuckling
helen of

troubles



  oh scar - identification yes i
know the way in want to go

   now what the dickens do you sup-
pose im asking questions for barry
demanded with a laugh as he turned
away  come on

  the two climbed into a taxicab and
herrick gave the driver his directions

  whats up barry the older man
questioned as the cab started down-town

   i want to find this man the one
with the scar i have an idea that we
saw him with lee larson to-day

   the fellow you thought looked like
you herrick questioned

  thats the one if he has the scar
on his face he must be the man i am
after a friend of mine-an old friend
from the west -barry laughed- is
anxious to have him looked up if i
am right i thought we might catch him
at larsons-wooing dame fortune
when the car came to a pause by the
post-office building the two men got off

   we walk the rest of the way her-
rick suggested turning down broadway

  barry glanced about him as his friend
led the way down a street to the left
the sidewalks were practically deserted
and the two moved along side by side
at a brisk pace

    want to get my directions barry
suggested coming to a pause as they
made another turn around a corner  i
might want to come here again

   lots of good it would do you her-
rick laughed  you couldnt get in

   then you can introduce me to some
one when we do get in so that i can
have entree hereafter

  herrick chuckled again

   i guess your man with a scar is a
fake did you acquire the gambling
habit while abroad

 poker-good american poker
barry answered  i have limits - at
least my pocketbook has

  they moved along a dark street to-
ward the east river but finally made
another turn-to the right this time-
and herrick stopped

   do you see that old hotel   he ques-
tioned pointing across the street  that
is the front door

   it doesnt look very promising was
barrys only comment as they crossed
toward it

  mounting the half - dozen steps that
led up from the sidewalk and pushing
aside heavy doors they stood in a small
square hallway there was a door
across from the entrance on the right
was a small opening in the wall which
had evidently at one time served as the
office but had since the days when the
building was used as a hotel been partly
boarded up

  as they paused an instant a head ap-
peared at the opening on the right and
two sharp eyes regarded them closely
herrick made a sign the head nodded
and instantly disappeared the two
went in

  herrick pushed open the door on the
opposite side of the lobby a narrow
hall that seemed to have no end led
away into the semidarkness down it
they walked the way twisted and
turned two more doors were passed a
short flight of steps mounted

   its a regular labyrinth barry mut-
tered

  herrick laughed back over his shoul-
der and pushed open the third door
they entered a fairly large well-lighted
room across one end stretched a long
bar with stained mirrors behind it

  a man of huge frame leaned upon it
and as they came forward he regarded
them silently his costume was the con-
ventional garb of a bartender his face
was heavy and dark his hands tremen-
dously large and powerful

  herrick nodded

   guess we will have a winged cock-
tail joe he suggested  might serve
it in the clouds

  the countenance of the man changed
instantly his little narrow slits of eyes
narrowed still more-but with a smile-
and his black - cropped head nodded
agreement

   winged to be sure sir he assented
in a deep bass voice  pick out the in-
gredients yourselves gentlemen

  herrick turned tolook at his friend
expecting to note some expression of
surprise at the mention of such a drink
but barry was waiting patiently and
the look on his face was as though the
conversation was the most ordinary in the
world

  herrick turned back to the man

   guess we will joe well look the

the all-story magazine

five barrels over twice and sound each
one six times rub-a-dub-dub five-
two-six-three crisscross in a circle

  instantly the man dived down behind
the bar and barry followed herrick
around the end

  the bartender had straightened and
his hands began to touch the beer-cocks
the faint buzz of an electric-bell sound-
ed across the room the fifth beer-cock
was touched-barry was watching the
mans movements with far more interest
than his face indicated-then the second
next the sixth and finally the third
then herrick stepped forward and be-
gan pressing first one then another of a
row of buttons on the top of the bar

  when he stepped back they all three
waited until the electric-buzzer sounded
again then joe stooped down and
with a push shoved three heavy boxes
that were under the bar to one side
straightening he touched a button on
the wall again the buzzer sounded
and with a faint click the floor under
the bar where the three boxes had
stood slid back turning joe touched
an electric-switch and the opening was
flooded with light from below

  a flight of stairs led down and with a
 pleasant evening and good luck gen-
tlemen from joe the two descended
as they reached the bottom the floor over
their heads slid back into place

  a very nice arrangement barry
suggested as they reached the bottom of
the stairs

   and we must go on herrick added
 no one ever comes out this way you
can get in if you know the code but
you cant get out

    cant get out  sounds ominous
barrv laughed

   there is another way of course 

   i trust so

  a long hall was before them and they
walked along side by side

   like alice in wonderland barry
mused  we should find a very beauti-
ful garden at the end

   its beautiful enough herrick
chuckled  and it ought to be consid-
ering what is dropped in here every
night

  at the end of the hall was a heavy
door upon which they knocked in-
stantly a panel in the upper part slid

back and herrick stepped to the open-
ing for a minute or two he held con-
versation with the attendant on the other
side

  finally he turned and beckoned to
barry

   put your face up to the opening he
said  they want to have a look at
you

  barry did as he was directed and re-
ceived the careful scrutiny of the man
on the opposite side at last the other
nodded

   step back if you please sir the
man said and barry moved away from
the opening

  the panel slipped into place and in
an instant the heavy iron door swung
out with a nod to the doorman they
passed through and went on down the
hall

  the way was carpeted now and hand-
somely decorated while masked lights
shed their soft rays on the walls were
large paintings here and there a palm
stood in a handsome jardiniere and
bronzes were in each nook

  i judge we are inside now barry
questioned

   yes herrick agreed as they passed
up two steps  here is the elevator
we will be in the house proper in a
moment

  they got out on the second floor
and herrick nodded to the attendant
 shant play to-night he said  you
caji get us a couple of cigars

   where is the wheel   barry asked

   in there his friend nodded to-
ward a back room  we can wander
round your man will be somewhere on
this floor or on the one above if he is
here at all

  they walked about slowly watching
the different games which were in prog-
ress and finally came to the large room
at the back where the roulette-wheel was
being courted

  as they stopped in the doorway bar-
ry touched herrick lightly on the arm
 there he is it is much easier than i
thought

   that is certainly the man we saw at
luncheon herrick nodded

  the one in question was tall and heav-
ily built dressed in faultless evening
clothes he stood directly before the rou-
helen of troubles



lette-wheel and the crowd about him in-
dicated that he was the center of attrac-
tion at the table

  barry pulled a bill out of his pocket
and pushed into the crowd at the mans
right tossing the money on the table
he named his color and glanced up at
the other he was not at all surprised
to see a faint bluish scar close to the
tight eye it was crescent-shaped as
helen gordon had said

  without paying any attention to the
result of the fall of the wheel other than
to note he had lost barry turned back
to herrick

   hes my man hes got the scar 

   sit here then herrick said  we
will have to wait until he gets tired
you cant speak to him while hes play-
ing

  they found two chairs in an alcove
that commanded a good view of the
room and waited for over an hour before
the man they were watching showed any
inclination of tiring

  at last he turned with a sour smile on
his lips

   no luck to-night he laughed

   it may change soon some one sug-
gested

   no the man shook his head  it
doesnt work that way with me i might
have known it its friday i never
can win on friday

  he turned toward the hall and barry
and herrick got up stepping ahead
quickly barry caught up with him as
he turned toward the stairs

  may i have a word with you he
questioned

  the man paused one hand on the stair-
rail and looked barry over with a cold
stare

   i dont think i have ever had the
pleasure he began

   no i dont think you ever have
barry agreed in his most winning man-
ner  i can explain in a few words
mr rutherford

  whats that the other demanded
stepping back like a shot  what name
is that

  his face went white while the hand
resting on the bannister trembled

  am i not right barry questioned
 i understood that your name was mr
rutherford

   well you understood wrong-do you
hear me -wrong 

  without another word he turned and
hurried down the stairs

chapter xiv

suppose

  beckoning to herrick barry leaned
over the bannisters to watch the man as
he hurried down the stairs and turned
toward the back rooms on the second
floor

   you say there is but one way out  
barry demanded

   yes only one so far as i know
why

   lets get our hats come on

  herrick followed barry to the floor
below and there securing their hats
they turned toward the door as they
were about to pass out an attendant
stepped up to them

   you just spoke to a gentleman at
the head of the stairs the man ques-
tioned

   yes barry agreed turning quickly
his glance traveled down the hall and
he thought he caught sight of a figure
which moved quickly out of sight as he
looked up

   the gentleman says that he will see
you outside in a few minutes the at-
tendant answered

  very good barry nodded just
say that i will wait for him

  the way out was not quite as com-
plicated as the way in although it was
nearly as far through hallways and up
and down stairs

  no one knows how many houses are
used herrick remarked

   one perhaps barry laughed he
was in a particularly good-humor for he
felt very certain that he had found his
man  we may be going round and
round in a circle

  at last they reached the street and
barrv started across toward the other
side

   well wait over here in the shadow
until he comes out

   he is your man then herrick de-
manded

   he says not but the way he said it
convinces me that he is and then his


the all-story magazine

sending word that he would meet me out
here must mean that he is the one  am
after

  the street was deserted row upon
row of what had at one time been old
residences but were now dirty lofts with
narrow entrances lined both sides the
two men stepped into a doorway from
which they could command a view of
the exit to lee larsons place and
waited

  finally the door across the way
opened and a man stepped out he
glanced up and down the street hesi-
tated an instant and then moved across
the sidewalk to the curb barry and
herrick came out of the shadow and
started across the street

  for a moment the man watched them 
then turning he moved slowly away
without attempting to catch up with
him the two followed

  at the corner of the street the one in
the lead stopped and barry moving
ahead of herrick stepped up to his side

   if you are sure im the man you
want to talk to follow me will you
i may be watched

  one word tumbled over the other as
the speech was delivered and almost be-
fore the last few words had been uttered
the speaker had started ahead again

  with a shrug of his shoulders and a
smile at the strangeness of the others
request barry waited until herrick
joined in then together they went along
after the man

   i think the whole lot of them must
be crazy barry remarked in a low
voice adding quickly  except one

   we are getting into a bad neighbor-
hood for this time of night herrick
counseled

   the deuce you say  barry laughed
 well we had better run into some-
thing-good or bad-pretty soon every
one seems to find it necessary to take me
to the end of nowhere before they can
tell me anything and then no one says
a word that sheds any light on any mat-
ter it beats chasing will-o-the-wisps

  so you are chasing something
herrick questioned

  barry nodded and they followed
round a corner and very nearly ran over
their leader so abruptly had he stopped

  well the man demanded as they

stepped back a little startled  what is
it you can talk to me here i guess
as well as anywhere else i dont know
you and how the dickens you know who
i am  cant say

  his tone was a deep growl and his
manner rather ugly but barry for some
reason set that down to a desire to hide
his real feeling of anxiety

  assuming a tone that was calculated
to appease barry spoke 

   yes i can say all i have to say right
here but of course i want to be sure
 am talking to mr rutherford

   well let her go i guess you wont
make any mistake

   very well then barry went on
 what i want to say is this your uncle
is very ill your cousin miss gordon
wants to see you she has a paper for
you from your uncle and she wants to
ask you some questions about miss ro-
land and mr hardston

  rutherford waited until the other
was through and then his expression
changed to a broad smile

   you and the whole lot of them can
go straight to the deuce my compli-
ments to my pretty cousin as for that
little sneaking-dwarf-may he get what
he deserves and let it be hot as for
miss roland oh you can say  by-by 
to her from me impress upon her the
fact that it is  by-by  for good

  barry peered sharply at the other it
suddenly occurred to him that the man
was intoxicated

 how about your uncle barry
questioned

  he remembered now that helen gor-
don had said that she did not think her
cousin would do anything but certainly
he had not expected to meet with such a
manner of indifference he watched the
other closely

 uncle ben rutherford ques-
tioned  say -he tapped barry on
the shoulder- i judge that you come
from helen so i dont mind talking to
you come round the corner with your
friend will you we can sit down and
go over it a bit

  they started off again rutherford a
little in the lead the man walked
steadily enough and barry decided that
lie had been wrong in thinking him un-
der the influence of liquor
helen of

troubles



  with rutheford for their guide they
passed through a dark and narrow door-
way and down a long hall to a small
room at the rear the place was quite
deserted but with some noise ruther-
ford roused a waiter and gave his order

   sit down he waved his hand at
the chair and tossed a cigarette-case onto
the table  make yourselves comfort-
able we can talk here without trouble
and have it all out

   do you know he turned to barry
 i am rather glad you came i can
send all my messages through you and
not have to bother to go out there not
that i would he shook his head as he
put the match to his cigarette  oh
 not for worlds i wouldnt go out
there again

  he looked at barry out of the corners
of his eyes and seemed to find a good
deai of amusement in his remark in
fact he appeared to be in a most excel-
lent frame of mind

   but to go out there as you put it
barry replied  is the very thing i want
you to do that is i want you to see
your cousin she will come to town and
meet you

  rutherford shook his head

   oh no she wont i have washed
my hands of the whole business and i
will not do a single thing let them
fight it out among themselves i want
nothing to do with the invention no
unknown force for mine

  barry was considerably taken aback
by the others pointblank refusal her-
rick sat by an interested listener his
round jovial face composed for once

    dont know a thing about this mat-
ter mr rutherford beyond the fact that
your cousin miss helen gordon is trou-
bled and in need of help

  rutherford drew deeply  his ciga-
rette and nodded

   you look able-bodied and shes not
a bad sort-though not my kind helen
is too conscientious she likes to hustle
too much though she can be good fun
 you should help her then barry
urged

  my dear fellow rutherford
laughed  in my judgment she is not be-
yond helping herself and she has got
uncle ben

   he is ill and wants to see you

  rutherford nodded

   sick is he  sorry to hear that but
it comes of his dealing with that villain
hardston he blessed me fine when i
told him to look out-you see i never
did like the cuss-and then he got a bit
suspicious himself we had a set-to
over that-in a way rutherford be-
gan to laugh softly  but it wasnt
uncle bens fault so much i dont
blame him fact he went on with
great candor  im not the kind to lay
it up against any one

   then you should go and patch up
the quarrel barry urged  really i
think you owe it to your uncle and cousin
to do so

  herrick who had been studying ruth-
erford with a good deal of interest
glanced at barry it seemed to him that
his friends suggestions were rather per-
sonal and he looked each moment for
the other whom he understood barry
had never met before to take offense
instead rutherford seemed to be enjoy-
ing the whole affair and not at all loath
to talk

   patch up the quarrel rutherford
repeated with a shake of his head  no
thank you you dont seem to under-
stand that i quarreled with my uncle on
purpose i wanted him to get mad at
me that was why i kept hitting at
hardston when he got suspicious
himself and asked me to look the thing
up for him why i just laughed at him-
to make him angry you understand-and
i did

  barry looked at the man before him
who spoke so indifferently in some doubt

   why in the world did you want him
to get angry with you   he finally de-
manded

  rutherford began to laugh as he
flicked his cigarette carelessly then
with a lifting of his eyebrows and in the
most indifferent way in the world he
replied

   because i didnt want him to make
me his heir

  both herrick and barry burst out
laughing and rutherford looked up at
them in astonishment

   sure as gospel  and then to barry
 you ought to be able to guess why

   i tell you mr rutherford i know
nothing about this affair so how should


the all-story magazine



i know what you mean for the first
time barry had become suspicious of the
others apparent frankness and was par-
tially of the opinion that rutherford was
amusing himself at his expense

  dont know anything about it
rutherford questioned drawing his chair
close to the table and laying a hand on
barrys arm  say would you want
a thing willed to you that half a dozen
other people wanted and might murder
you to get

   murder you  barry exclaimed
rutherford leaned back and nodded in
the most solemn manner imaginable
 how in the world does such a condi-
tion enter into your helping your
cousin  

   any one who mixes up in this mat-
ter is likely to get his throat cut so i
am showing more sense than i ever
thought i had and dropping the whole
business

   would you mind explaining what
you mean barry questioned
rutherford leaned forward again

   you know that my uncle has discov-
ered an unknown force that knocks the
spots off of electricity and steam-a con-
centrated energy in a quinin pill  

   i have the newspaper accounts of
the matter and i also have your uncles
statement that his discovery was not per-
fected

  his letter to the papers ruther-
ford nodded with a laugh  that was
a blind just about the time he wrote
that letter he began to get suspicious of
that little dwarf friend of his that is
why he wrote the letter

  it was hardston then whom he
asked you to look up   barry demanded

   i should think it was he wanted
me to go chasing round after some infor-
mation and  cut it because i wouldnt
get mixed up in the matter

   but where does the throat - cutting
business come in

   uncle ben wanted to give me this
discovery there are a lot of papers and
stuff and he wanted me to take them
he said he didnt want to bother with
the thing the way he put it was that
he had worked it out and knew it would
do all he claimed for it with that he
was content he just wanted me to
have it- i could make millions out of

it and i was to give helen half im
not for making millions-that way

   why  herrick spoke for the first
time

  why have millions and pass in i
need millions to be sure but i would
rather just worry along with the few
thousands i have and keep a whole skin
 but barry interposed  if you had
this secret it would be surety for your
life

  rutherfordshook his head

   im safe as long as i havent it if
i had it id have to prove it was per-
fected to make any money out of it
wouldnt i

   yes barry nodded

   well what do you suppose would
happen to me then that cursed little
lawyer would not rest content until he
had got it out of me he wouldnt lie
satisfied either with just gettirig it
hed cut my throat to be sure he would
have it all alone - and some one else
would help him im thinking ruther-
ford ended slowly

  barry stared at the other in aston-
ishment

   you are not serious he demanded
 well i guess i wont mix up in the
thing at all

   tell me barry leaned over the
table he was puzzled at what he had
learned  how this prevents you from
going to your uncle and making up your
quarrel and thus helping him and your
cousin  

  rutherford drew a deep sigh

   if i made up my quarrel with uncle
ben he would leave me all his papers
i would have this unknown force on my
hands and hardston on my trail some
morning the newspapers would tell about
my passing in-poison or a knife

   that would result from your quarrel
being made up with your uncle you
might be killed but if that didnt hap-
pen which i am frank to say to you
mr rutherford i do not believe hard-
ston would get this secret and neither
you nor miss gordon would benefit by it
am i right

  if my quarrel w-as made up which
it wont be rutherford nodded

  barry got up and stood looking down
on the other

   suppose he spoke very slowly
the conquerors flight



hardston or miss roland got some one
that looked a bit like you to go to your
uncle and making him believe it was
you thus patched up the quarrel what
then 

  rutherford waved his hand to barry
in disdain

    it couldnt be done

  but suppose it had been done
barry urged

   well rutherfords brow wrinkled
up in perplexity  i dont know if
they did fool uncle ben that way i sup-
pose he would leave the thing to me
hardston might kill uncle ben then and
he could forge enough papers to get the
invention into his hands if he thought
i was in his way hed end me i dare
say and then-oh the dickens you cant
tell what will happen when you begin to
suppose

    well youd better begin to find out
barry broke in sharply  they have
done it

  for an instant rutherford stared at
barry then he started to smile stopped
and his face grew white

   what the deuce do you mean   he
cried

   just what i say barry replied
quickly  last night a man went out
to hardstons he looked a little like
you and he made up your quarrel for
you he fooled your uncle and he even
gave your uncle to understand that some
one was all right that he need not be

to b  eo

 worried that in fact he had looked
 a matter up and found nothing do you
 understand now  

   rutherford drew his glass to him and
 he drained its contents at one gulp all
 the time his eyes were fastened on barrys
 face and into them had come a look
 such as a whipped and cringing dog
 might have when terribly frightened

   understand barry questioned
 again

   he was startled to think of what his
 act might mean he could not would
 not believe it was as bad as painted by
 rutherford and yet there would evident-
 ly be some result from it if nothing
 more he had perhaps done that which
 would deprive the rightful owners by
 discovery or inheritance of the benefits
 to come to them from benjamin gordons
 discovery

   rutherford leaned across the table and
 forced a laugh

    you are a joke how could any
 one do it 

    but they did i did it look at
 me in the dark i could pass for you
 when  one had reason to be suspicious
 i changed my voice i did it

   for an instant rutherford stared at
 barry and then with a roar lie bounded
 to his feet

   he was no longer the same man gar-
 rulous and indifferent but one charged
 with madness and wild anger

   like a shot he leaped forward

the conquerors flight

                by george w wilson

 bout two fathers who fear-
 ing their children wouldnt
 obey pretended not to allow it

it was dark on the terrace still
darker on the lawn and at the
beach gordon trent standing in
the shadow of one of the huge
palms gazed moodily out into the niglit

  at the other end of the terrace
where the japanese lanterns still flick-
ered fitfully in the wind a girl paused
a moment and turned back

  the last guests were departing a few
intimate friends remaining for a rubber
and a cold bottle from the darkest corner
of the famous burr vaults

 the man sank into a chair and
waited

   its a bitter pill to have to see her
like this when there isnt any reason but


the all-story magazine

 an old mans silly notion a mythical
 family skeleton so old its dust is be-
 yond microscopic visibility

   he sighed and lit a cigarette a half-
 hour dragged slowly by a distant
 church clock struck-

   slowly-as with time grown weary-
   twelve deliberate strokes in all

   another half-hour passed

   a cloor behind him opened softly a
 faint stream of light fell across the ter-
 race and vanished as rosaline burr
 closed the door after her

    sweetheart 

   gordon rose eagerly

   she came toward him slowly a sad
 tired little smile gave an added charm
 to the beautiful face

  why did you come

    the same old reason

    and its just as useless

    im not surprised

   she sat down in the chair he drew
 for her  terrier  jumped upon the
 table beside her and she idly stroked
 his ears in silence the man railed at
 the darkness straining his eyes longing
 for even a fleeting glimpse of the dear
 face

    were going abroad saturday leave
 here to-morrow

   she did not look at him she knew
 how the pain would show in his dark
 eyes she at least could partly spare
 herself that

    and youd have gone without letting
 me know left me to read it in the
 papers 

   wouldnt ithave been better

    possibly id have followed you in
 any case may i ask whose idea this
 sudden departure is

    fathers  i acquiesced

   gordon smiled

    i thought so suggested when  

    discussed some time decided last
 thursday

    the decision is final 

    absolutely

   how long are you going to be
 gone 

    indefinitely

    do you want to go 

    no

    then it was not your decision  

  partly im going from a sense of
 -let us say-

 being bullied into it he put in
 if you like she shrugged

  your father idea evidently is-
  out of sight out of mind 

  possibly

 at all events he thinks you will get
 over loving me if he keeps you away
 long enough what is your theory
 there was a little anxiety in his tone
  i have none

 gordon smiled the answer did not
 surprise him it was characteristically
 noncommittal

  why do you let him bully you into
 these things he asked presently

  it hasnt been all bully i have
 thought he was right

 now he questioned eager hope
 in his voice

  im beginning now to think he is
 mistaken we discussed the subject this
 afternoon

 stormy he inquired

  about as usual he said rather moro
 hateful things about you

  for instance 

  i was throwing myself away that
 you love me now because you do not
 possess me afterward it would be the
 same old story-there would be other
 women id end up in the divorce
 court

 she spoke calmly as though repeat-
 ing old facts threadbare with discus-
 sion

 anything else

  nothing i care to repeat except he
 asked if you had ever kissed me

  yes  there was a quick catch in
 his breath a thrill in the rich voice

  i didnt tell him the truth
 why the wicker-chair arm
 creaked beneath his merciless grip

  because that belonged absolutely to
 me

 gordon stared steadily at the two
 lamps on the dock trying vainly to
 crush back the memory of that mo-
 ment

  what steamer are you sailing on
 he asked unsteadily after a silence

 do you think that is kind

 no its brutal - but ive decided
 brutality is my only hope

 if you told that to some one else
the conquerors flight



 they might believe it i couldnt no
 matter how much you might want any-
 thing- even me - you would not be
 brutal about it

    then you think i have a few re-
 deeming graces he laughed

    several you are mercifully con-
 siderate and you can be trusted that
 is why i granted your request to-night
 -and saw you

    rosaline he said after a long si-
 lence  we have loved each other two
 years your father has continually re-
 fused his consent to our engagement
 simply because my dad is an inventor
 and an aeronaut and therefore con-
 sidered by him a fool and there is
 some family feud so antediluvian no
 one knows just what it is

    some antiquated ancestor of your
 fathers stole the idea for a shade-
 roller from fathers ancestor she in-
 terrupted with mock dignity

    imaginary  he scoffed

    still there is war to the death be-
 tween the two houses your father
 doesnt want you to marry the daughter
 of a broker ayy more than my father
 wants me to marry the son of an in-
 ventor she reminded him

    granted your father is down on
 me because ive never been brought up
 to work had no business training and
 just lived the average life of the son
 of a man of wealth and position i
 can quite understand his attitude in
 some things and why you have listened
 to him

    he has pointed out to you that a
 man who cant earn his salt is not capa-
 ble of taking care of a wife that if
 my dad should lose the family millions
 in some pipe-dream as your father calls
 these ventures of dads youd starve be-
 fore i could earn enough to buy bread
 as to my past life which he condemns
 i have met and gone with men and
 women who  will admit were not all
 they might have been

    still i have not followed their ex-
 ample or ever done anything i am
 ashamed of i have never asked you
 to marry me without your fathers con-
 sent but to-night i feel that the situa-
 tion is hopeless sweetheart let us take
 things in our own hands be married
 and end this living hell for both

     	s

   madness - thy name is gordon
trent  she mocked

  he struck a match quickly and held
it above her face the black eyes be-
lied the mock in her voice they closed
slowly-the match sputtered-went out

  if i did that she spoke slowly
and with an effort i should go to
you a pauper

  he leaned forward holding out his
arms eagerly

   then come-i want just you 

  she took his hand and rising moved
to the little swinging seat

   dont make it harder for me dear
i feel to-night  cannot bear much
more if i had not known your
strength known how completely i can
trust you and myself with you-i could
not have seen you-and gone to-mor-
row i love you more than ever in my
life just because you have never asked
me to do this i told dad that to-day
and it didnt help my cause he
laughed

   he said he would thrash you with-
in an inch of your life if he caught
you

   the desire is mutual

   and impossible from your side

   oh quite but i cant give you up
hes got to let me have you let me
see him

   useless dear in the first place
he wouldnt see you and in the sec-
ond he wouldnt give in nor would
your father either

   then lets elope its the only way
in spite of your fathers idea as to my
ability to earn a living if the gods
fate and you arent all against me i
can ive been working he added
quietly for the last five months

   gordon  - where   she cried
why didnt you tell me

   in dads shop on the place a
mechanic-forty a week i couldnt
afford automobiles pearl-girdles or
that sort of thing but i can give you
a home and love you with-

   simons simons where is miss ro-
saline an irate voice thundered

  the girl sprang to her feet the
man rose slowly

   its father hes missed me go-
quick  she whispered trying to push
him toward the terrace steps
	the all-story magazine

  with a low exultant laugh he
caught her in his arms

    not alone

    please  she implored

  gordon shook his head

    rosaline  rosaline  

  the voice was coming nearer a
light down the terrace was switched on

  who the deuce is there stormed
old mr burr as he limped along

    gordon please - i cant bear his
ranting to-night she pleaded broken-
ly  ill come-to you-later

   now is our only chance dear
heart

  she threw a frightened glance over
her shoulder at the figure approaching

   a muffled explosion the steady whir
of a powerful engine

   oh i- thought as much-darn your
young insolence  shouted the old man
as he tried to hasten his steps  ill
be rid of you to-morrow for good and
all you young cub and before i go
ill tar and feather you

    gordon its almost here  rosa-
lines arms tightened around his neck
 i-i cant go-ask him- she plead-
ed piteously

   mr burr wont you relent and
give rosaline to me

  you brazen young cub i never
heard such insolence  the old gentle-
man shouted his face purple with rage
give you my daughter no he
roared

   rosaline looked over her shoulder

    come 

  she broke from gordons embrace
caught up the evening coat from the
back of a chair and ran down the
steps to the waiting car

   it started almost before she was in
gordon leaped into the rumble and
like a thing possessed the car raced
through the night followed by a dupli-
cate fiend

   theyre catching us thorne hit
her up for the conquerors shed 
gordon shouted to his chauffeur as he
clung to the seat

  a gray flash a cloud of dust and
the car shot like a meteor through the
 east gate of the trent estate past the
garage around the bend out on a cin-
der track

   hit her up theyre still coming

  half the circle was made through
another gate down a narrow lane into
a strip of wood out and across a
meadow a long siren shriek rent the
air down at the edge of the inlet
two white lights flashed twice

  give her some more thorne
gordon urged his voice hoarse with
excitement

   cant sir shes gone the limit
the big car rocked and swayed as it
bounded along the uneven road and
the girl clung with nervous strength to
the seat once she turned a white face
to the man leaning over the back
well be there in a minute dear
where are we going

  to the sky where they cant fol-
low theres only one conqueror 
he answered grimly

  the bark of a revolver sounded above
the roar of the machine the big car
swerved violently leaped back into the
roadway and tore on

   the tire   gordon groaned  the
old tartar is a good shot he added
aloud  but tires are expensive targets
at any time and it wont hurt them to
lose a few

  leaning far out over the rear of his
car gordon drew a small box from his
pocket strewing its contents in a broad
path across the road	v

  sharp ear-splitting explosion after
explosion followed in quick succession
the pursuing car still came on

  rosaline closed her eyes in an agony
of suspense and fear they had lost
there would be a scene she would
take that ride again with her father-
and to-morrow-she moaned at the
thought

  the speed of the car slackened al-
most suddenly it was still under head-
way as gordon leaped to the ground
and almost lifted her out

   run for it sweetheart he cried as
he caught the two suit-cases that al-
ready willing hands had unstrapped
from the car

   this way miss burr a voice
called from out the shadow

  as she ran rosaline saw with throb-
bing pulse the dim outline of the great
dirigible air-ship a dense shadow
among the blur of shadows she ran
lightly up the few steps of the ladder
the conquerors flight



and with a sense of unutterable relief
stepped over the side into the basket

   lively there boy 

  gordon paused one foot on the lad-
der the other in the basket peering
down through the darkness to catch a
glimpse of the dear familiar face

 dad-you here

  a hand reached up and grasped his
that was all already the propellers
were revolving with a roar that drowned
all but their masters voice

  cast oft

  slowly and with the grace of an
eagle the huge air-ship rose majestic-
ally higher higher it soared swung
in a long splendid circle out over the
dark waters of the sound and shot off
eastward over the tree-tops

   stop them  i say stop them   bel-
lowed old cyrus burr as the disabled
car limped up to the shed  how
dare you aid and abet such rascality
he thumped the floor of the car with
his cane-literally gaspipg in his rage

 the elderly man in mechanics
clothes looked after the rapidly vanish-
ing green and red lights

   if id been able to fly i wouldnt
have killed two horses in one night
he remarked more to himself than in
answer to the question

 did ifou run away too mr
burrs tone was more peaceful

   yes i married the woman i loved
the same as my boys going to and
just as you did

   then sir why didnt you let him
marry her raged old burr

   i knew he would if he loved her
i wanted to find out that is why i
refused my consent and later when he
asked again cut off his allowance i
thought that was a pretty sure way to
find out if it was the lasting kind

   then sir old burr sputtered
 you knew they intended to elope

   purely accidental mr trent an-
swered with an amused smile  i came
down here to the laboratory after din-
ner and overheard gordon talking to
rosalines maid and his chauffeur
thorne the maid promised to pack
a suit-case and see that thorne got it
the men in the shop promised to have
the conqueror ready for an instants
flight so i just stayed round to see
that everything was o k and see them
off

   the boy knew you would give
chase if you found out so it was ar-
ranged that if you followed they were
to make for the air-ship and once
there they had you he went over in
his car just about the time your din-
ner guests were leaving so the arrival
of an automobile would naturally not
rouse any suspicions you know the
rest pretty clever i thought

   humph  snorted mr burr
 pretty nervy i call it good thing
for me the beachs chauffeur was sick
and didnt come for them id just or-
dered up my car to send them home
id never have been in to even this
much of a finish

  mr trent chuckled quietly

   does that young rascal know any-
thing about running that fool of a
thing mr burr demanded

   what he doesnt know wouldnt
fill a book loves the best professor
there is hes been working here in
the shops with me for the past five
months im satisfied

   humph i guess were both satis-
fied why didnt he tell me that
take me home trent and well open
a bottle and drink their health but
its rascally nervy to rob a lonely old
man of his only child 

   you did it yourself they are both
chips of the old block mr trent re-
marked quietly

   come on  sniffed mr burr

          the barrier

            anonymous

chapter xiv

a mystery solved

as masefield rushed through the
labyrinthine corridors of the
palace of peace on the heels of
ahmed aziz he became aware
that for the first time in its history the
isle was in a state bordering upon panic

  the arrival of the advance ships of the
armada of peace was reason enough for
excitement but thp disappearance of the
sidi senussi the pivotal center of all
that had happened and was about to
happen flung the priests and the in-
habitants of the isle into a frenzy of
fear

  white-robed priests and purple-clad
slaves rushed blindly through the palace
spreading the dire tidings of the veiled
prophets disappearance

  they were met by others who brought
the exciting news of the armadas ar-

rival the air was vibrating with the
roar of saluting cannon-sounds which
had never before disturbed the peace of
the quiet isle it was as if terror and
pandemonium had suddenly been let
loose in an earthly elysium

  in the confusion of it all masefield
and ahmed were unnoticed the ka-
byle swiftly passed  through a maze of
passages which turned and twisted and
seemed to double back on themselves
but never once did the son of the desert
pause and masefields implicit trust in
him was presently rewarded

  after descending at intervals flights
of winding stone stairs which seemed to
lead to the foundations of the palace
ahmed stopped short before a dark door-
way

  had it not been that dicky schuyler
had distinctly stated that the door was
without the palace and some distance to
the rear of it masefield would have be-

the cataclysm



lieved that this was the place the irre-
pressible had spoken of as  the jail
but this was under the earth and beneath
the palace itself

  the adventurer turned to his servant
and scanned his face for some hint as to
the meaning of the expedition ahmeds
visage was stamped for a moment with
dismay he was looking at the door of
studded hardwood and seemed to find
cause for dread in the fact that it stood
half open

   the sidi has passed this way he
said quickly  the sidi has gone to
plead with them once more it is
death 	

   what do you mean  shouted mase-
field his patience exhausted

   the warriors said ahmed aziz
enigmatically  they fear the sidi
who has walked unscathed through their
midst before but this time they will
kill the sidi who alone held them in
check follow me master you shall
sec with your own eyes-and know

  he passed through the dark doorway
masefield following him for a few
minutes the adventurer was walking
blindly through almost gravelike gloom

  he could discern however the white
glimmer of ahmeds robes and to this
his eyes clung as he stumbled forward
over a rough flooring apparently of
stone

  presently his eyes became used to the
gloom he observed that the place was
not absolutely dark it was illumined
by a strange bluish light where this
light came from he could not imagine
later it dawned upon him that the air
was charged with phosphorescence

  presently he made out that they were
passing through a natural tunnel the
arching walls of which were of a white
gnarled stone-some form of coral which
everlastingly dripped water the floor-
ing of the passage was of the same sub-
stance hut it was rough and slippery
and at intervals there were pools of sea-
water which gave off the bluish light
more strongly

  when they had gone about a quarter
of a mile a hollow humming overhead
suggested to masefield that he and
ahmed were walking under the sea this
idea was presently verified by a heavy
reverberation directly above their heads

at tjje same time a shower of water-
drops fell about them

   the  war-ships - guns  said
ahmed without pausing but with an
upward lift of his hand

  on they went through the- ghostly sub-
marine passage the way seemed miles
long to masefield and every step of it
was punctuated with some feature which
chilled the blood momentarily the
coral in some places had fashioned it-
self into grotesqud shapes so that the
tunnel to the heated imagination was
swarming with strange creatures

  and every moment a fresh salute was
fired away up on the surface of the sea
the ocean reverberated against the coral
roof the coral shuddered and seemed to
crack and the still pools shivered and
rippled restlessly every moment the
mind expected to experience the crash of
collapsing walls and the booming of the
merciless sea through that narrow place

  they had been walking about twenty
minutes though the time seemed longer
to masefield when ahmed stopped be-
fore another door this door also was
open and like the one in the founda-
tions of the palace it was crossed and
studded with iron bars and bolts

  but the time which they had taken to
traverse the tunnel and the distance which
they had covered precluded any idea of
its being the door of which dicky schuy-
ler had spoken that must be a third
door probably situated in some branch
of the tunnel near the palace

  this thought in masefields mind led
to another from the palace foundation
to this second door the tunnel had run
comparatively straight no longer could
be heard the ocean gurgling overhead
the vibration of the saluting guns seemed
less and more distant-as if left behind
they were again upon land but what
land it could not be the isle of peace

  his mind flashed back to that first
glimpse which he had had from the deck
of the ulysses he remembered that
there had been two islands one to the
eastward and smaller than the isle of
peace it was inhabited too he sud-
denly remembered and there had been a
town of odd-shaped houses

  but interest in it had been eclipsed
at the time by the beauties of the greater
island later the smaller island had


the ail-story magazine

dwelt in masefields mind as merely an
outer key-one of the numerous small
islets which stud the great bahama belt
which stretches in an arc from the coast
of florida into indefinite reefs hundreds
of miles ter the southeast

  this second door must give entrance to
the smaller island which masefield sud-
denly recalled was significantly named
forbidden island up to now it had
merely been a name but all at once he
thought he saw a solution of antons
mysterious disappearance and the harsh
throbbing chorus which he had so often
heard when the wind was in the east

  most important of all he began to see
now where the sidi had gone-whether
carried by force or voluntarily

  by this time masefield and ahmed
aziz were through the door and floun-
dering amid darkness which was intense
after the faint bluish illumination of the
tunnel under the sea

  a minute later masefield struck
against ahmeds hand which had been
thrust back in the gloom as a signal to
the white man to pause at the same
time the kabyle whispered

   be very still my master 

  masefield remained where he had
been stopped not a sound came to his
ears save ahmeds deep breathing he
could see nothing he could feel no
particular sensation in his mind or body
in the blackness of this place he could
almost imagine that he had been dream-
ing and had suddenly awakened from a
fantastic nightmare to find himself
looking up into the midnight darkness of
his cabin aboard the ulysses

  presently a flicker of pure blue ap-
peared ahead and a little above the level
of masefields eyes the rift was in the
shape of three sides of a square one
side wider than the other two which
tapered in parallels into sharp points
in a moment masefield knew that ahmed
was lifting a great trap-door and that
the blue light was that of the evening
sky which was soon revealed in all its
starriness

  ahmeds head was silhouetted against
the now full square of light in another
moment the square was disfigured by the
kabyles body as it ascended through the
trap ahmed disappeared leaving the
trap-door wide open masefield reached

to the ground and felt a flight of stone
steps he walked lightly to the highest
and raised himself through the trap
he was on land-strange land in an
instant he was sure that it was forbid-
den island

  but his attention was withdrawn in a
second to the action of ahmed aziz
the kabyle was crouching close to the
ground and to the astonishment of mase-
field who had become used to disasso-
ciating ahmed and his ilk with blood-
thirstiness the servant  had a long thin
knife gripped between his teeth in the
same glance masefield caught sight of
ahmeds prey-a tall almost gigantic
figure which stood a few paces away
black against the starry skies

  the figure was half naked around
the middle and fastened over the left
shoulder was a great hairy skin the
bare right shoulder and arm stood out
white and muscular in the right hand
was clasped a battle-ax while on the left
wrist was buckled a shield the figure
was like the ghost of an ancient norse-
man

  how long the tableau lasted mase-
field never knew it seemed an eternity
while he listened to the most barbaric
uproar which the mind could conceive
it was a wild confusion of metallic
clashing and ribald shouting and sing-
ing yet all smote upon his ear with a
throbbing rhythm as if the authors of
the savage noise were dancing in time
to the ferocious war measure

  how long the picture lasted mat-
ters little the figure which had been
intent upon the same sounds suddenly
turned and saw ahmed with a snarl
of rage it leaped forward at the same
time ahmed aziz sprang erect and to-
ward the giant masefield saw the
shield lift and the great ax swing against
the heavens

  he saw ahmed spring and the glitter
of the long thin blade then without
a sound the mighty man in the hairy
raiment collapsed like a felled tree with
a red rivulet streaming from his throat
ahmed aziz priest of peace had slain
him as remorselessly as a butcher would
a bullock

  the kabyle drew his blade through
the grass and turned to the astonished
masefield
the cataclysm



   conie my master said lie quietly
it is well

   ahmed aziz said masefield hoarse-
ly  where am i what does this mean
is the sidi-here 

  he waved his hand toward the collec-
tion of odd-shaped houses in the center
of which was a great square building
which rose in pallid whiteness behind a
flare of fire it was from this center of
light that the discordant chanting arose

   the sidi is there said ahmed
 come i go to my master or to death
with him will the lion - heart follow
ahmed as ahmed has followed him  

   i will follow you as i have already
followed you said masefield  but
first forewarned is forearmed what
does this mean 

  a shadow of impatience crossed the
kabyles face he led masefield for-
ward by the arm rapidly speaking in a
low voice

   this is the forbidden island he
said  this is the place apart where
discord is imprisoned by the sidi and
the priests did the giaour think there
was no worm in the peace of our isle
was the giaour a child or a fool
through the centuries it has been thus
they were men of all nations from the
ships of all nations which you saw

   the first were of the norse and they
loved war they are norse in lust and
battle he waved his hand towardthe
miniature city  you saw that man-
his size - his strength-his raiment
they are stillnorse and the others have
learned their ways they have in-
creased with the years they number
thousands

   and the sidi 

   the sidi has striven with them to
abandon their creed and be at peace
they have honored the sidi he has
walked unscathed among them-alone-
once twice thrice but in some man-
ner they have learned of the worlds
peace-

   anton 

   the giaours eye is as the camels on
the desert he sees the real from the
shadow this is the work of the sheik
anton here he has hidden but here
we thought he was safe yet the doors
have been unlocked-how i know not-
and the sheik anton has passed between

the islands day by day their clamor
has been greater but we were without
fear until to-night when the sidi van-
ished

   she may pass unharmed  cried
masefield clutching at a tliread of hope
 she may have come to speak peace
again

   that may have been her intention
said ahmed quickly  but my master is
not deaf he heard the cry she was
taken-by force-by the sheik anton

  masefield groaned quickening his pace
and in turn dragging ahmed forward
 we must save her 

   we go to death said ahmed
quietly

  but masefield did not hear or cared
not the sidi was there-his sweet sidi
-among a thousand monsters

  in a few minutes they came to the edge
of the flaring town and there a sight met
masefields eyes which sent the blood
flying helter-skelter through his veins

  ahmed crouched in the long rank grass
at the edge of the savanna which they
had crossed he drew masefield down
beside him looking straight ahead
they could see into a wide plaza which
was surrounded by crude square build-
ings

  the greatest of these was the vast
white building which the adventurer had
first noticed

  lights were burning everywhere it
was a scene of the wildest gaiety of de-
bauchery in the center of the plaza
burned a huge bonfire around which
hundreds of gigantic figures armed and
shielded leaped and danced and shout-
ed striking their brazen shields with
swords and axes to the rhythm of a hor-
rible war-song and tied to a stake in
the bonfire was a white-robed figure
around which the flames were curling
hungrily

  masefields heart stopped beating and
a red mist spread before his eyes but
when he dashed his hand across his
vision a groan of relief burst from his
heart that was no human figure which
crowncd the pyre of fagots - at least
not the figure which he had feared to
see there

  it was an effigy-an effigy of the god-
dess of peace the warriors were
burning it as the crowning jest jf their


the all-story magazine

hideous war-dance at that moment the
cannon of the last-arriving war-ship
roared through the night

  the dance paused the flames ran
over the white-robed effigy and consumed
it then a shout of savage mockery
split the air and the warriors with one
accord shook their spears axes and
swords to the stars and laughed-laughed
-laughed

  and the sidi was there-somewhere
there probably she was in that great
white building at that moment in the
toils of the sheik anton anton mase-
field knew must have torn the veil from
the sidis face and discovered the resplen-
dent loveliness which had been behind it

  at the thought of her peril the sweat
rolled down masefields face regard-
less of the odds he sprang to his feet and
would have dashed into that mad throng
of barbarians had not ahmed flung his
arms around his master for a minute
the two men wrestled madly it was the
lithe son of the desert against the mighty
anglo-saxon-cunning against strength
masefield his face ablaze with fury bent
the kabyle backward until it seemed
that the servants back must break

  will you let me go gasped mase-
field

   some one - comes-master  the
kabyle managed to articulate

  masefield came to his senses on the
instant he released the faithful ahmed
and glared around him in the night

  a dark figure was stealing toward them
across the savanna in the same direc-
tion which they had come the adven-
turer drew a blue-barreled weapon from
his hip and leveled it through the dark-
ness

  halt who comes he demanded
quietly

  it was ahmed who spoke before the
intruder could answer

  it is the nubian he whispered
 he brings word

   advance said masefield lowering
the revolver

  the nubian stole forward and held
out his hands in token of peace when
within a few yards he knelt on the grass
and made the sign of the hand

   it is well he said  the sidi is
within the palace

  for a full minute neither ahmed aziz

nor masefield found their voices so great
was their stupefied amazement the nu-
bian understood bowing low he add-
ed

   these be the words of a hafid to
ahmed aziz and the excellency

  the sidi in the palace masefield
echoed dully

   even so excellency said the nu-
bian  with mine own eyes i have seen
him

  masefield turned to ahmed the
kabyle was looking at his master with
wide-open eyes and the question in them
was clear something whispered to
masefield that all was not as it should be

  ahmed was asking himself another
question who had passed through the
doors of the submarine passage and left
them open none but the sidi had that
power and privilege

  still the sidi was in the palace
ahmed knew that the nubian spoke the
truth so far as he knew it there was
nothing to do but return certainly no
good could come of remaining on the
forbidden island in the inflamed state
of its inhabitants and in masefields
reckless mood

   master let us return ahmed said

  still doubtful of the truth of the nu-
bians statement masefield followed
ahmed and the slave back to the trap-
door over the body of the slain norse-
man ahmed aziz paused a moment while
he prayed then making the sign of
the hand he dropped through the trap-
door into the tunnel masefield after him
with the nubian bringing up the rear

  in silence they walked under the strait
to the foundation of the palace here
ahmed stopped in momentary astonish-
ment before the heavy iron-studded door

it was shut and locked

  for a moment or two the kabyle stared
with a frown then he smiled to mase-
field and said

   my master sees my master will
remember that this door was open now 
it is closed and barred the sidi has
returned

   and we said masefield with a
laugh  are locked in  

   not so said ahmed and he turned
to the nubian how earnest thou
he asked

  for answer the nubian turned into a
y

the cataclysm	

passage which branched off to ths left
a hundred yards along this minor tun-
nel he paused before another door
masefield knew at once that this was
dickys jail door the nubian drew
a great key from the folds of his purple
raiment and unlocked the barrier be-
yond the door was a short cavern and
beyond that was the clear air mase-
field smelt the sea and the perfume of
a million flowers with a sigh of relief
they were once more in the gardens of
the isle of peace

  without waiting for ahmed aziz or
the nubian he walked rapidly toward
the palace portals passing through the
hall of the fountain he came to the
guarded entrance to the sidis apart-
ments the single nubian there made
way for the familiar excellency who
passed unhindered through the audience-
chamber into the sidis bower she was
not there

  filled with a renewal of his worst
fears he started at a run through the
passage which he had traversed with the
sidi when she took him to the parapet

  when he reached the little white-cur-
tained doorway his heart was beating
with fear hope excitement and sus-
pense he did not pause but boldly
thrust aside the curtains

  she was there against the dim light
of the stars she stood her face veiled
looking strangely erect against the clear
heavens she turned at the sound of his
step and gave a great start-whether of
surprise or fear he could not tell

   sidi  he whispered stepping out
upon the parapet

  she drew back from his extended
arms and laughed-a queer half-choked
laugh he guessed on the instant that
she was overwrought and that she had
undergone some terrific strain still
with his arms out and whispering her
name he moved toward her but again
she drew back

  suddenly she flung out- her right arm
and pointed seaward

   see  she exclaimed with a note of
triumph it is mine-all mine

  he looked too startled by her vehe-
mence to do anything else

  it was a magnificent sight

  as far as the eye could travel the
ocean was aflame with fire-rows upon

rows of lights-ships outlined in hull
water-line and rigging in electricity

  masefield -could now understand her
pose her emotion her gesture

  this was her work her triumph hers
-all hers

  the fears of the night fell from him
like clouds before sunshine a mistiness
of joy and pride came before his eyes

  he turned to her with a choking sen-
sation in his throat

   oh my sidi  he whispered

  but she had vanished-again

  and again his heart was filled with
dread misgiving and doubt

chapter xv

ox earth-peace

  with the first day of the new year
dawned the first day of the new era
at sunrise the temple bell had boomed its -
solemn note the hand of peace had lift-
ed in benediction to the highest pinnacle
and the ships of all the nations of earth
had dipped their ensigns to that univer-
sal flag

  the voice of the sidi had cried from
the parapet and she had lifted her hands
in universal blessing the mighty
matin-song had swelled through the still
air and the men who manned the worlds
navies had bent their heads in reverent
awe to listen

  no man had ever witnessed a more
simple yet inspiring ceremony even
the full-blooded youth of the battle-ships
felt for the moment that peace was bet-
ter than the battle for which their hearts
had lusted

  presently the scene became one of
quiet activity boats were lowered from
flag-ships and rowed ashore with the al-
most mechanical precision of naval move-
ments in the stern of each facing the
bluejackets were officers in full dress
uniform and sovereign representatives in
the somber attire of fashion

  upon the marble terraces the priests
and inhabitants of the isle of peace stood
like a silent white army awaiting the
delegates not a sound disturbed the
scene save for the sighing of the seas
and the breeze and the lulling strains of
the pinnacle lyres-not a sound until tha
first boat touched the landing terrace


the all-story magazine

   it was the britisli boat

  as lord airdmohr stepped ashore he
removed his tall hat and bowed with
polished grace he murmured a few
conventional phrases to a hafid who
replied with a word of welcome in the
name of the sidi senussi and a smile that
was all his own then his lordship ad-
justed his monocle and surveyed the pal-
ace and the people with a leisurely stare

  but all the self-suppression of cen-
turies of refinement could not down his
amazement he suddenly whipped the
glass from his eye and turned to a
hafid

   ton my word  he cried  was
there ever anything so perfectly lovely 

   nothing save perfect love excel-
lency said ahmed aziz over a hafids
shoulder

  at the strange voice his lordship
screwed in the monocle once more and
stared at the kabyle the kabyle was
the man who had spokenundoubtedly
yet the man who had spoken had betrayed
his alma mater-oxford

   ah   said his lordship discovering
ahmeds identity

  and that was all he said although he
continued to survey the man in whose
hands the peace of algiers and morocco
had lain so long-the man who more
than any other man was responsible for
universal peace

  and so reflected his lordship this was
the redoubtable ahmed aziz a very
remarkable man he concluded inwardly
as if in echo of masefields own estimate
of his servant

  presently the french boat came along-
side the delegate leaped ashore with
celerity and advanced toward the group
with his arms extended he was a lit-
tle man with a nervous manner and
pince-nez balanced dangerously on the
very tip of his nose

  the drama of peace was upon his
soul tears rolled down liis cheeks and
next moment he was in a hafids arms
much to the lofty disgust of his lordship
of great britain

  the german boat came next a
heavy gentleman with spectacles and a
bismarckian countenance solemnly ad-
vanced and shook hands with a hafid
and the whole row of elder priests one
by one the japanese envoys-three of

them-came next and made their stiff
little acquired bows to all and sundry
after which they drew apart from all
other nations and furtively made notes
on their cuffs

  the american representative came
ashore with an easy nonchalance which
brought a smile to a hafids face
the old priest did not forget mase-
fields part in universal peace and took
the opportunity to congratulate the
united states on the possession of his
excellency masefield

  what ejaculated the united
states delegate you dont mean to
tell me that penrhyn masefield is at
the bottom of this

  a hafid waved his hand toward
masefield who stood a little way apart
on the terrace with his arms folded
by his side was dicky schuyler a less
silent spectator of events

  the american envoy stood looking
at the adventurers for a moment his
jaw almost dropped then unmindful
of all convention he darted up the
steps with his right hand extended

   masefield i always said that youd
plunge the united states into some-
thing radical but whod ever have
thought it would be peace 

  why kerr-by all thats lucky
cried masefield recognizing an old ac-
quaintance  how on earth did you
get here last time-lets see-you
were fighting for the repeal of the duty
on tea-or something let me introduce
mr schuyler-richard schuyler

  mr schuyler- how-ddo mr
schuyler said mr kerr shaking
hands with the irrepressible who drew
himself up with dignity as he always
did when masefield honored him with
the  richard  yes continued mr
kerr  it was tea thats eight years
ago masefield but im the human
cork my original ancestor must have
floated to the top at the deluge as i
would i dare say in a cataclysm

  in an hour the entire delegates and
their escorts were ashore and assembled
in the sidis audience - chamber which
had been illuminated for the occasion
beside the dense mass of curtains stood
the sidis throne the nubians on either
side with their little lamps burning
mystically
the cataclysm



  as masefield looked at the throne he
saw again the vision of his first day
there when she had risen to deliver
that impassioned speech his heart
ached and the motley of envoys around
him-orientals and occidentals-faded
away

  he only wished to see her-her real
self to be sure that it was she to
know that she was safe to hear her
well-remembered unmistakable voice

  for the doubt was still knocking at
his heart was it she who had
screamed was it she who had passed
alone through that dread passage be-
neath the sea leaving the doors wide
open was it she who had returned
and locked them how had she es-
caped death among that savage horde
on the forbidden island if indeed it
was she who had gone there was it
she who had drawn away from him on
the parapet and pointed with trium-
phant gesture to the armada of peace
and cried

   see they are mine - all mine 

  but his doubt was presently to be set
at rest or made certainty a sudden
hush fell upon the waiting envoys the
temple bell boomed thrice through the
palace then not a sound was to be
heard but the lyres and the tinkling of
the water as it fell from the hand of
peace in the hall of the fountain a
whisper went through the audience-
chamber

   the sidi senussi 

  masefield took a step forward his
body fell rigid his eyes burned in his
head as they fixed themselves on the
dense mass of crimson curtain she
was coming-the sidi

  he would look closely at her he
would mark every line of her body
he would penetrate the veil and see
her eyes he would listen and hear
every syllable that fell from her lips

  a murmur went through the cham-
ber the curtains had fallen aside as
if a magic hand had touched them
and lo the white figure of the wonder-
worker was revealed to the expectant
eyes of the envoys of the nations which
had lain down together at the sidis
voice

  at the very first glance masefields
heart leaped with relief it was the

sidi-his sidi he knew that turn of
the arm as her hand gathered the filmy
draperies around her he knew that
carriage although it seemed to him un-
steady as he had seen it once before
when she was laboring under great emo-
tion he only waited to hear her voice
to be sure

  she advanced to the throne mounted
it and turned to face the worlds en-
voys her right hand was raised above
her head the fingers half closed ex-
cept the forefinger which lifted in the
sign of peace

   her voice came through the stillness

   my lords and gentlemen you are
welcome

  a shaft of delicious pain shot
through masefields heart it was the
sidi it was the voice of the sidi-
the sweet bell-like tones which he had
heard in the softer words of love

  the cloud rolled from his mind it
had all been a mistake it was not she
who had passed through the tunnel
she had never left the palace it was
the sidi-his sidi

  but- something was wrong from
the heaven of relief he was again
plunged into the hell of mental tor-
ture she was addressing the envoys
why did she falter why did she trip
over the words why was her voice
so quiet and tremulous-so faint

  why when she had finished her brief
words of welcome did she descend
from the throne and pass through the
curtains masefield saw her hand a
rolled document to ahmed aziz he
saw her sway lightly as she walked to-
ward the curtains he saw her pass
out as if some greater will than hers
was drawing her steps

  a murmur of astonishment broke
even from the envoys the star per-
former in the great drama about to be
enacted had made exit before the en-
voys had had time to feast their eyes
upon the magician who had wrought
this wonder of the world

  but another surprise was being pre-
pared for the delegates ahmed aziz
advanced to the foot of the throne and
turned to the audience with the docu-
ment in his hand masefield knew
what it was the envoys divined it
was the peace message


the all-story magazine

  but was this peace message which so
concerned the white races to be read by
s swarthy son of the desert-a moham-
medan-a blackamoor

  my lord airdmohr whipped the
glass from his eye and stared-an unre-
fined stare of astonishment and anger
the french delegate whipped off his
pince-nez symptoms of dissatisfaction
appeared among the delegate

  ahmed aziz took in the situation at
a glance whatever had been his in-
tention he did not betray by a move-
ment of his face that he had ever had
an intention masefield perceived that
something had gone wrong the sidi
his heart told him was unable to pro-
ceed the reins were in ahmeds
hands

  but ahmed was equal to the occa-
sion he addressed the envoys in a
quiet submissive manner which won
instant tolerance the sidi was much
moved he said the sidi desired to
be alone in this great moment

  the sidi believed that the peace
message should be read by one who was
not an envoy if it should be agree-
able to all the message would be read
by one who had rendered service to all
and to the cause of peace - the hon
penrhyn masefield

  masefield came to himself with a
shock he-he was to read the peace
message to the delegates of the world
what did this mean was it another
whim of his lady or a resource of the
fertile ahmed

  but he had no time for thought the
envoys were waiting they were gazing
at him with perfect satisfaction and
friendliness stamped on their faces
his lordship of great britain smiled
and nodded his head

  hustle your honor whispered
dicky  for the glory of little old
new york-hustle

  quick whispered mr kerr the
united states representative  its a
feather in my cap  

  before masefield fully realized it he
was standing at the foot of the throne
with the rolled document in his hand
presently amid a hush he heard his
own voice coming from the other end
of the universe in the opening words
of the message

  like its great predecessor it was
characterized by simplicity brevity and
earnestness it set forth the beauties
of peace the benefits to be derived
therefrom and the manner in which
these benefits might be attained and
kept permanent

  as masefield read his voice took on
strength and enthusiasm it was her
message it was her voice that was
speaking through him it was the
message that he and she had written
together during those long sweet days
as he read of love- love everlasting 
-he could feel her hair brushing his
neck her breath touching his cheek  and
the sweet perfume of her body was in
his nostrils his voice rang out with
the spirit of the message- love ever-
lasting peace on earth and good will
among all men

  when it was finished he stood still
for a moment with his head bent he
was moved but so also were the en-
voys of the nations the french dele-
gate was in tears and even his lordship
of great britain was standing very
erect-very grave-very severe

  then and for the last time the vote
was taken again the vote was unani-
mous save for three opposing ballots
again there was silence every eye was
on masefield something was expected
of him what he looked at the sea
of faces with bewildered eyes

  the british statesman calmly nodded
his head and smiled encouragingly
masefield understood but his heart sank
at the magnitude of the words which he
was expected to utter

  his eyes fell upon two faces in the
crowd they were the faces of dicky
schuyler and the united states represen-
tative david kerr all at once mase-
fields voice returned to him for their
words echoed through his mind

  he drew himself erect and faced the
envoys of the world with quiet manly
dignity

  his words were simple but they came
from the heart of a strong honest man
and they carried their own power with
them

   then in the name of heaven in
the name of the sovereigns and rulers
of earth and in the name of all man-
kind-let there be peace
the cataclysm



  he himself was startled by the effect
of his words a mighty cheer burst from
the lips of the assembled envoys it
shook the walls of the audience-cham-
ber reverberated through the palace and
out over the sea to the listening ships

  it swelled and died and in dying
found new life and redoubled in volume
presently it found an echo in a terrific
uproar from the ocean the navies of
the world were discharging cannon in
honor of the first day of the new era
and the crashing of the guns seemed to
be answered by a blast of trumpets in
the very vault of heaven

  masefield could stand it no longer
he had looked for some extraordinary
scene even if it were a climax of com-
plete fiasco but for this he was unpre-
pared before his vision was millenium
the lion was lying down with the lamb

  the british envoy was solemnly shak-
ing hands with the delegates of the other
nations of earth the french envoy
was sobbing in the arms of the german
delegate the russian representative was
holding a japanese by the shoulders
while the irrepressible dicky was waltz-
ing another jap around the audience-
chamber

  the hon david kerr of the united
states was bowing his acknowledgements
to the representative of alfonso of spain
sweden and norway were cementing
renewed friendship with handshaking
and tears and above it all the hand of
peace was waving from the highest pin-
nacle and the navies of the world were
thundering and roaring dipping their
flags and cheering

  but masefields heart was with the
sidi he escaped from the frenzied
audience-chamber and rushed up the
winding stairs which led to the parapet
to clasp her to his heart to look into
her eyes to hear from her own lips that
all was well-it was for this and this
only that his heart hungered

  he reached the parapet she was
not there she was not there to look
upon her amazing victory masefield
stared like one bereft of memory

  he looked out over the sea it was
covered with dense white clouds of
smoke through which peeped the tips of
funnels and spars above his head he
heard a mighty rushing sound

  looking up he beheld a cloud of
snowy white doves ascending straight
into the sky trailing behind them were
long ribbons of a million colors which
bore the glad tidings to heaven and
earth

  but where was the sidi

  where was the sidi in this awe-in-
spiring moment

  masefield turned toward the point
where the wild bananas and the sea-
grapes overshadowed the little cove of
their happiness she was not there

  as his face looked in that direction
slowly over it came a spasm of pain and
fear

  the wind was wafting from the
southeast and again he heard it -
throbbing menacing defiant horrible

chapter xvi

peace and pandemonium

  it was ten oclock of the forenoon of
new years day when peace-universal
peace-was declared

  the next hour was given over to the
bursts of enthusiasm which shook the
air aboard the ulysses and aboard
the flag-ship of each nation the wireless
operators were tuning in various stations
on the american coast various naval sta-
tions among the west indian islands
and whatever steamships answered and
to all those the good news was being
flashed and through them to the wide
world

  in less than an hour the four words
 peace has been declared  had been
flashed through the greater part of the
civilized world

  as when the guns bellowed beside the
isle of peace and the white doves flew
to the heavens the message was the sig-
nal for the most stupendous celebration
in every capital city town hamlet and
cottage in europe and the western
hemisphere

  it was between two and three oclock
in the afternoon when the news was re-
ceived in europe owing to the difference
of time it was dawn on the pacific
coast of america it was between ten
and eleven oclock at night in japan
but from the extremeeast to the extreme
west of the earth the air was vibrating


the all-story magazine

with the rejoicing of earths peoples
for war should be no more

  for an hour after the peace message
had been read by masefield all procedure
was stopped it was impossible to pro-
ceed although the greatest item on the
peace program was yet to be executed
y common consent the envoys ad-
journed agreeing that the noon - hour
would be appropriate to the disarma-
ment of the navies-the casting of the
weapons of war into the sea

  besides that the envoys must prepare
the document which signed by each and
every delegate representing each and
every nation of earth would seal the
great compact

  it was then that masefield understood
why he had been allowed to read the
peace message that document was
merely the final clarified proposition of
peace

  it had been accepted and its accept-
ance was clearly set forth in the procla-
mation which the envoys now prepared
it did not lake masefield and the united
states delegate long to discover that none
but the sidi senussi could read this final
proclamation

  among the delegates there was no
question upon this point although mase-
field could not help wondering how the
sidi was to be reached or if the sidi
would be able to read it

  yet this was not in his mind as much
as the probable impossibility of finding
the sidi senussi the more he thought
of it the more was he convinced that
something was grievously amiss

  the suspicion had gradually strength-
ened upon him that antons hand was at
work behind the scenes although he
felt sure that the sidi who welcomed the
envoys was his sidi he could not recon-
cile his sidi with the veiled figure which
had pointed to the armada of peace and
said

  see it is mine-all mine

  the words had echoed dully through
his brain and with constant repetition
the last emphasized word had begun to
shout through his mind with a sinister
harsh note mine

  the word echoed and echoed now a
sibilant whisper now a jeering chuckle
again a mocking laugh and presently
the whole sentence sang through his

brain to the air of that throbbing
menacing war-chant

  and that figure on the parapet had
looked taller in stature and without that
lissome slightness which he knew so well
he remembered the poise of the figure
against the stars that was not the
sidi yet the sidi who had entered
the audience-chamber was the sidi
then he remembered the peculiar be-
havior of the sidi in the audience-cham-
ber-how the voice-her voice-had
quavered and stumbled over the words of
welcome and how she had suddenly
swayed toward the curtains

  was it possible that she was in the
toils of anton even then that the ter-
rible renegade was using her to his own
ends whatever they were was it pos-
sible that that figure on the parapet was
not the sidi at all

  but who save himself could discover
tins no man had ever gazed upon
the face of the sidi save himself he
alone could tell the face of the sidi

  true he could tell dicky the truth
if dicky did not suspect it already but
what good would that do it would
be his word against-nothing he
dared not tear the veil from the sidis
face in the presence of the priests and
even if he did-

  with a groan he turned away from
the council - chamber where the envoys
were still discussing the ultimate proc-
lamation near the door he discovered
the kabyle whose eyes had he but
known it had never left him in the last
fifteen minutes masefield made a sig-
nal to ahmed just as ahmed signaled to
him

  together master and servant passed
into the hall of the fountain there
they sat down on the alabaster parapet
within which the water-lilies basked in
the sunshine from the overhead circular
rift the sunlight fell upon masefields
face as he looked into ahmeds

  the white man was pale and hag-
gard ihe kabyles eyes were burning
strangely

  the servant waited for the master to
speak

  ahmed said masefield i wish
to speak with the sidi

   the sidi senussi would be alone
replied ahmed smiling strangely  it
the cataclysm



is impossible my master to see or speak
with the sidi at this time

  there was silence between the two
masefield was searching the others face
presently he said in a low voice

   ahmed hast thou ever gazed upon
the face of the sidi

   no my master replied the kabyle
easily  nor has any man-save it be
thyself giaour he added fiercely

  masefield did not flinch before the
eyes that suddenly burned like a tigers
he waited until ahmed lowered his
gaze then he whispered

   i know that no man is permitted to
gaze upon the sidis face yet ahmed
answer me would you know the sidi
otherwise by the height by the
gesture  by the voice  would you not-
ahmed interrupted in a startling
fashion

   the giaour said he  wastes
words it was the sidi and it was
not the sidi do i not know my mas-
ter does not my heart feel his dread
presence do not my ears know his
footsteps the sidi is in the hands of
the sheik anton  

  masefield started to his feet his
words came fast-almost incoherent

   then where is the sidi  who was
it spoke from the throne who was
it spoke on the parapet  ah you
were not there but i tell you- ah-
med what is to be done

   nothing said the kabyle quietly
 that which is done-is done that
which will be-will be  

  an exclamation of impatience at the
mans stoic fatalism burst from mase-
field but ahmeds words were not all
stoic fatalism he looked anxiously
into the face of his master and said
slowly

   giaour it is in my mind that the
sidi is in the hands of the warriors
or worse in the hands of the sheik
anton haste then will help neither
the sidi nor us at the noon-liour-
you have heard-the sidi will-must-
appear the sidi must read the mes-
sage-the real sidi or the false

  if it is the real sidi-it is well
she shall be carefully guarded and
there will be no further mishap if it
is the false sidi-

  he will die whispered masefield

in an intensity of anger  i will kill
him where he stands

  in the hour of universal peace
said ahmed aziz watching the others
face closely

  confound universal peace cried
masefield springing to his feet  i tell
you ahmed there will be no universal
peace on earth so long as a man loves
a woman and the red blood flows hot in
his veins

  his words recalled another scene-
the little inlet where the multicolored
fish played and darted away from the
ripples started by the pebbles which he
threw from her lap and he heard her
voice in the distance

   some day when war has been dead
centuries and centuries all men will
love one another as you love dicky

  it was a flash of some idle brain-cell
it was as if in answering ahmed he
had been answering her his mind sud-
denly cleared and the fighting blood
of the man for the woman of his love
suddenly flowed strongly and steadily

  he looked at ahmed the kabyle
had watched the tempest and knew that
it was over he was smiling

   does my master still trust his ser-
vant 

   more than i trust myself you are
no longer-my servant

   still may i serve my master in
serving you

   what will you do

   at the noon-hour-mark  

  masefield drew his watch from his
pocket it lacked but ten minutes of
the hour already the envoys were
filing back into the audience-chamber
the guns had become silent the
palace was wrapt in profound stillness
save for the everlasting hymn of the
lyres

  masefield suddenly felt an arm thrust
through his he looked into the face
of dicky schuyler for once the ir-
repressibles countenance was stamped
with gravity masefield saw and knew
that dicky knew

   stand by for trouble dicky lie
said quietly

  dicky nodded but uttered not a word
they were presently joined by the
hon david kerr

  the three men moved in a group into


the all-story magazine

the audience-chamber by dint of cour-
teous pushing they succeeded in reach-
ing the inner edge of the circle of envoys
and found themselves standing by the
side of lord airdmohr to whom the
place of honor had been accorded

  it was a repetition of the former
scene tense silence prevailed slowly
the minutes passed my lord airdmohr
held a gold repeater in his hand

  to masefields strained senses came
the ticking of it like the beating of his
own heart lord airdmohr suddenly
drew a deep breath pocketed the re-
peater and looked toward the dense cur-
tains at the same moment the temple
bell boomed thrice

  it was noon the great moment had
arrived the curtains at the farther
end of the chamber parted a white
figure appeared and advanced to the
throne masefield bent forward and in
an instant his blood surged in mad bat-
tle-lust

  that was not the sidi

  he knew even as he had known that
the figure in the previous scene had been
the sidi the gesture was missing the
figure was taller and moved with none
of the queenly grace of the sidi

  masefield turned to look at ahmed
the kabvles eyes were glowing like
coals but ahmed aziz turned to lord
airdmohr and bowed his britannic
majestys envoy handed him the docu-
ment which the envoys had prepared

  ahmed took it and advanced with
deliberation toward the throne his
eyes were fixed upon the white figure
lie paused at the foot of the throne
there was a lingering air about the way
he delivered the document into the hands
of the veiled prophet

  it was as if he was prolonging the
ceremony for some reason of his own
indeed masefield noticed that the hand
which prematurely stretched forth to re-
ceive the paper trembled and drew back
as ahmed still held his arms at his side

  then ahmed aziz did a strange thing
as he handed the document to the veiled
figure he suddenly knelt and grasped
the sidis wrist with his left hand while
he imprinted a kiss on the veiled hand
which was extended to receive the docu-
ment

  it was a strangely awkward saluta-

tion the envoys thought to masefield
alone was the action fraught with sig-
nificance

  masefields eyes never left the figure
 the throne he was watching every
movement and his suspicions were
confirmed by the actions of the veiled
prophet

  the sidi took the document bowed
to the assembled envoys and calmly
handed it back to ahmed aziz at the
same time making a gesture which was
meant to be a command that some other
person read the proclamation

  a low laugh broke from masefields
lips lord airdmohr started and
frowned disapprovingly on the man at
his side

  he discovered that masefields face
was stamped with ferocity that there
was a cruel smile about his mouth

  for the sidi-or the figure which rep-
resented the sidi-had reckoned without
convention he had apparently hoped
that the proclamation could be read as
before by masefield he knew also
that no man had ever seen the face of
the sidi and he knew that he was safe
as long as he did not utter a word that
would betray a strange voice

  the envoys were waiting ahmed
aziz smiling had turned away from the
veiled prophet and was returning to his
place among the priests but suddenly
at a signal from airdmohr which
plainly said  the sidi must read the
kabyle turned and looked back at the
throne

  then after a moment of mystified
silence in the chamber the astute son
of the desert advanced once more and
with the same deliberation toward the
sidi senussi

  to the envoys it seemed that he pur-
posed whispering airdmohrs message
but during the few seconds of still-
ness it was apparent that the veiled fig-
ure was in the throes of unexpected
suspense no longer could the envoys
remain blind to the fact that something
was amiss

  ahmed had purposely created this em-
barrassing situation that the nerves of
the impostor might be tried to the ut-
most and his plan was not without
result - a result which was apparent
even to some of the priests who began
the cataclysm



to whisper among themselves while their
eyes searched the figure on the throne

  but ahmed aziz was not done in-
stead of kneeling at the foot of the
throne he advanced boldly up the steps
a gasp of amazement arose from the
envoys a murmur of horror broke
from the priests they forgot their mo-
mentary suspicion in dismay at ahmeds
irreverent action they only remem-
bered that this was the sidi senussi
and that ahmed aziz was guilty of a
terrible breach of decorum

  but ahmed passed up the steps as
deliberately as he did all things the
sidi drew back ahmed suddenly
straightened up and raised his hands
a cry burst from the priests my lord
airdmohr whipped his glass from his
eye and various exclamations of disap-
proval burst from the envoys

  only masefield understood at ah-
meds first movement the adventurer
pressed dicky schuylers arm and
stepped out from the semicircle of rep-
resentatives

  but before he had gone three paces
the audience-chamber was in an uproar
of indignation ahmed aziz had flung
his arms around the veiled figure and
the dread sidi senussi was wrestling in
the arms of the swarthy son of the
desert the two figures interlocked
fell to the steps and rolled downward
to the carpeted floor still writhing in
each others embrace

  the envoys broke from the semicircle
protesting incoherently the priests
raised their hands to heaven and crying
their horror rushed toward the com-
batants but masefield was quicker
than them all his tall figure shot
across the intervening space

  they saw him bend over the writhing
figures and with one swift movement
tear the veil from the face of the sup-
posed sidi senussi

  at the same time ahmed aziz broke
away from his opponent and leaped
backward masefield dragged the un-
veiled sidi to his feet and the face of
caspar anton was revealed to every per-
son in the room

  it was as masefield and ahmed aziz
had anticipated but they in turn had
reckoned without possibilities

  the very moment anton stood up in

    	s

his borrowed robes with a wild cry of
dread the priests to a man turned away
and hid their eyes that they might not
look upon the naked face of the prophet

  even had they looked it would have
been of little help to masefield and ah-
med aziz the priests had never seen
the face of the sidi they had never
seen the face of anton

  they would only have seen a face
which might have been the face of the
sidi any face that was strange might
well be that of the sidi

  and the envoys were in the same state
of ignorance they had never seen an-
ton they had never seen the sidi it
was all a mystery to them save that an
outrage-a terrible outrage-had been
perpetrated in that solemn moment
when peace was to be proclaimed and
war was to be no more a mocking de-
struction of the fitness of things had
occurred

  masefield saw the disaster in a mo-
ment anton saw it he calmly re-
arranged the veil round his face and
attempted to return to the throne with
the dignity befitting a monarch who
could afford to overlook the actions of
madmen

  at the same time the envoys bore
down upon masefield and ahmed aziz
intending to seize them my lord aird-
mohr issued a commandto the escort of
armed marines which had accompanied
the delegates in an instant a score of
mausers were leveled at the two daring
men

  to fire a shot in that audience-
chamber in the moment of world peace
would have been an act of fatal di-
plomacy the envoys knew it mase-
field knew it masefield did not even
draw a weapon he looked at the angry
throng before him and smiled some
one brushed his shoulder it was dicky
schuyler

  stand by for trouble said dicky
cheerfully standing back to back with
masefield

  a fourth man leaped into the circle
of three it was the hon david kerr
representative of the united states

   this means ruin anyway  said the
human cork  so im with you but
i hope to heaven you know what you
are about


the all-story magazine

   we do said masefield calmly

  all this had transpired in less than
half a minute and in the meantime
pandemonium was shrieking through the
palace the sidi senussi - or rather
the veiled caspar anton-was standing
erect with his hand raised in the sign
of peace with difficulty silence was
restored

  but before the sidi could speak lord
airdmohrs voice choked off the words
which would have revealed all

   in the name of peace  airdmohr
cried  i demand that these men be
removed from this place

  remove them cried the sidi from
the throne his voice palpitating with
the rage which had burst from control

  at once he had betrayed himself to
the priests although to the envoys the
uproar which followed was but con-
fusion upon confusions head

  the white army of holy men de-
scended upon the impostor with the rage
which only insulted piety can feel

  the envoys stood aghast several
turned and left the hall

  next moment a terrific crash re-
sounded through the air it was the
voice of the guns

  such a scene as then ensued no words
can convey to the imagination the en-
voys were rushing aimlessly and panic-
stricken

  caspar anton the veil again torn
from his face by the infuriated priests
was backed up against the throne firing
rapidly from a revolver

  his eyes fell upon masefield anton
leveled his weapon at the man who had 
ceased to be his friend but even as
he fired the priests again closed in upon
him the bullet flew wide and struck
one of the great lianging-lamps

  the lamp burst and its blazing oil was
showered upon the carpeted floor which
immediately caught fire in another
minute the audience-chamber was filled
with choking smoke through which
leaped long red tongues of flame

  through the blazing room there sud-
denly shot the figure of lord airdmohr
he was hatless and disheveled his
face was as pallid as a dead mans
aloud he cried with an hysterical split
in his voice

   heaven have mercy upon us the

  navies of the world have turned their
guns upon one another  

  but that was not all

  the words were hardly off his tongue
before there leaped from all directions
like ghouls and demons born of the
roaring flames scores of shaggy mon-
strous men armed with spears swords
and axes

  they swooped down upon the hapless
priests and envoys with a mighty cry

  skoal

  the warriors of forbidden island
had broken loose antons triumph was
complete the battle-ships for some
mysterious reason had opened fire upon
one another

  the isle of peace was a sudden hell
the palace was enveloped in flames
the sidi was missing

  universal peace in the twinkling of
an eye had turned to universal war

chapter xvii

the armada of steel

  the escort of marines who had been
about to throw down their weapons
obeyed the order of their lieutenant

  the envoys were huddled together
like sheep a wall of armed men
surrounded them with their mausers
 ready

   fire  came the command

  masefield dicky and the hon david
kerr lost somewhere in the dense smoke
instinctively fell on their faces the
walls of the audience-chamber shook
with the confined explosion of the rifles

  bullets zipped in the air and thudded
sullenly into the walls and the cries of
the wounded redoubled again and
again the volleys burst out but each
time their volume was less

  the marines were being cut down by
the hairy norsemen whose thirst for
blood knew no caution presently
above the yelling of the warriors and
the roaring of the flames the rifle re-
ports grew spasmodic and finally only
the occasional crack of a weapon told
of the last stand of the survivors

  ahmed aziz groped blindly for his
master

  giaour  he said with a sob it
was a mirage let us go forth
the cataclysm



   the sidi  cried masefield hoarse-
ly where is the sidi lead the
way or i will kill you 

  ahmed straightened up his figure
was only an arms length from mase-
field but the adventurer could not see
the kabyles face so dense were the
fumes but he heard his voiee calm
once more

   my master we go to the sidi or to
death follow me but first let the ex-
cellency schuyler return to the ulysses
let the captain weigh anchor and sail
westward along the coast and let him
watch the shore for a signal we may
need succor

  dicky heard and needed no more
he felt in the gloom for masefields
hand

   good-by old horse said he  if
we dont meet here or in heaven well
meet on broadway

  good luck to you dicky said
masefield  ill go with ahmed you
take kerr with you hes a very re-
markable man my servant and kerr is
bound to float out somehow

  in another second dicky and kerr
had vanished trusting to luck to get
out as masefield trusted to luck and to
ahmed to find the sidi senussi in this
whirlpool of disaster and flame

  ahmed caught his master by the
sleeve and led him through the choking
gloom round them pandemonium still
reigned the audience-chamber was no
longer the hall of universal peace

  it was a shambles the marines the
priests the envoys had been massacred
to a man the uproar was dying away
as if the blood-lusting fiends had swept
through the palace and out of it

  in a few minutes masefield scorched
and bloody found himself in a corridor
which was filled with cool compara-
tively clear air how the two men
reached there unscathed neither could
ever tell both were wounded but not
dangerously both were scorched ah-
med being the worse off in this respect
his white robes were almost burned
from his body he was half naked

   go on  said masefield hardly
realizing the unreasonableness of his
command

  but ahmed seemed to understand
and he apparently knew where he was

going again as on the previous
night masefield found himself running
through labyrinthine passages but this
time the trend of their flight was up-
ward ever upward the air grew
warmer and the ascending smoke more
dense as they climbed the spiral stair-
ways

  they came to a gloomy half-finished
part of the palace presently ahmed
aziz burst open a door he entered
and immediately reappeared dragging
a hideous toothless old man who
whined aloud for mercy ahmed drew
from the folds of his half-consumed
clothing a little bow with a thong
stretched upon it

  where is the sidi he demanded
slipping the bow-string around the
mans neck

  mercy excellency i know not
screamed the wretched creature

  ahmed aziz gave the bow a single
twist the mans face became convulsed
and his mouth opened the kabyle re-
laxed the thong and repeated his ques-
tion this time the man spoke truth

   come she is here i will show
you

  ahmed heaved a sigh of relief

  allah is great masefield heard
him mutter  i thought so turning
to masefield he said quickly the
sidi has been imprisoned

  the toothless old jailer drew a bunch
of keys from his girdle and shuffled
along the narrow dark passage mumb-
ling to himself the fear of the bow-
string was upon him

  i-ie did not hesitate when he paused
before a narrow closed door but fitted
a key into a lock and turned it with
celerity

   behold excellency abdul kisses
your feet 

  masefield brushed him aside and
stepped into the room ahmed aziz
would have followed but he suddenly
turned and waved the toothless jailer in
before him abduls face expressed his
disappointment he had hoped to lock
the excellencies in and let them kiss
tljcir own feet

  but when ahmed aziz entered the
room his hungry eyes were unsatisfied
instead of the dread master whom he
worshiped the only occupants of the


the all-story magazine

room were masefield and an extremely
beautiful woman who was sobbing on
the adventurers shoulder

  the moment he became aware of the
kabyles presence masefield command-
ed him sharply to lead the way out of
the palace to safety

   but the sidi my master  said ah-
med aziz folding his arms and assu-
ming a reproachful sternness

  masefield laughed

  the sid blushed and all at once she
drew the veil across her face the mo-
ment the familiar aspect of the dread
prophet was complete ahmed aziz pre-
sented a face upon which nothing was
the principal expression

  he had seen a beautiful woman and
in the flash of a gesture that woman
had suddenly been transformed into the
dread presence

   come  said masefield impatiently
 time flies ahmed the palace is
burning  will explain in time this
is the sidi senussi her face needs no
veiling besides unveiled she will pass
unrecognized

  as he spoke he gently disengaged
the veil from his beloveds face for a
moment she stood gazing with liquid
eyes at ahmed then she spoke

  ahmed-my faithful ahmed

  at the words the kabyle forgot or
forgave he dropped at her feet and
bowed his htad she raised him by the
hand then masefield uttered a warn-
ing word

   come my master  said the kabyle
and he led the way back into the cor-
ridor

  the toothless jailer abdul had van-
ished but ahmed did not pause to in-
quire into his disappearance again
they ran blindly through the smoke-
filled halls only ahmeds instinctive
knowledge of the labyrinthine passages
brought them to the open air

  but before that as they descended a
flight of spiral stairs a terrific crash had
resounded and the walls on either side
of them had quaked and cracked

   quick   cried ahmed aziz  tjje
palace is falling

  no - not yet said masefield his
eyes wide with astonishment  they are
bombarding the palace  

  in a few minutes they were at the

door through which it had been the
sidis custom to make her exits when
she went to the little cove

  the scene that presented itself to their
eyes was as amazing as it was magnificent
and dreadful the palace gardens were
strewn with dead men among them en-
voys in fashionable attire marines in
uniform and a few of the hairy men of
forbidden island

  in the offing hung a great pall of
smoke through which spurted flashes of
fire followed immediately by the roar
of guns the disrupted armada of
peace was engaged in the most extensive
sea-fight the heavens had ever looked
upon

  but in the gardens there was compar-
ative safety the battle seemed to have
passed that way and on to some other
point but it was far from perfect
safety even as they paused to draw a
deep breath of pure air another ball
hurtled through the air and struck one
of the pinnacles of the palace

  only the fact that the spire collapsed
to the western or opposite side of the
palace saved the trio from instant death
beneath the falling debris as the pin-
nacle fell the lyres suddenly ended their
song of years and from the yawning
gap in the alabaster leaped a great col-
umn of flame the palace was doomed

  masefield turned to the sidi her
face was deathly pale and wrought with
an anguish which found an echo in
masefields soul

  he swiftly picked her up in his arms
and followed ahmed aziz who wasal-
ready running across the gardens toward
the wooded part of the island they
reached the cool shelter of the woods
without mishap and there they rested
for a few minutes

  but they were not out of danger yet
over their heads at intervals hurtled
screaming cannon-balls and shells burst
with terrific reports among the trees

  if they are firing at the palace its
bad shooting said masefield if
theyre firing at each other its atrocious
its more like the practise of a pack of
untrained landsmen

  suddenly a thought occurred to him
but he dismissed it immediately as the
fancy of an excited imagination

  also at the same moment his atten-
           

tion was drawn to a crashing in the
woods like the rushing of a body of
men it was a man in european
civilian dress appeared through a break
in the trees in a single moment he
had covered the trio with a repeating-
rifle

  all right roberts all right it is

	- masefield  sang out the adven-
turer

  he had recognized the man who once
said that he might be a coward but was
certainly no fool

  the man roberts dropped his rille
and gave a whistle at once the escort
of picked men all armed sprang out of
the brush

   thank heaven  said masefield
under his breath outwardly calm he
said to roberts  glad to see you
how did you come here

   mr schuyler sir said roberts sa-
luting  gave us the tip to look out for
you as you might need help to get to
the yacht

   bless the boy  masefield said to
himself

  he gave the order to form around the
sidi when this was done the party led
by ahmed aziz struck across the island
bearing in a southerly direction in
about half an hour they emerged from
the woods upon a white beach the sea
stretched before them sparkling and
clear and lying as close inshore as she
dared was the yacht ulysses

  the leader of the picked men rob-
erts discharged his rifle it was an-
swered by a toot of the yachts whistle
a boat shot out from her side and came
rapidly toward the shore

  a groan of relief burst from mase-
field he bent his head and looked into
the still face which was cradled upon his
shoulder

  the sidi was unconscious

  it is needless to recount the difficul-
ties which dicky schuyler and the
hon david kerr overcame before they
reached the ulysses

  on such a day and in such scenes
the greatest perils were as wind - puffs
compared with the one astounding
thing which was taking place

  the ulysses was under full steam
but hove to when schuylers boat ran



alongside dick speedily introduced
kerr to captain carlson and as quickly
accounted for masefields absence carl-
son sprang to the bridge and signaled
the engine-room

   im mighty thankful to get out of
this he said  couldnt do it though
without orders

  schuyler could not iielp admiring the
cool nerve of the swede the bravest
man might have been pardoned for sail-
ing to a safer harbor than the bay of
the isle of peace appeared to be at that
moment

  to the eastward lay the great pall of
smoke which had astonished masefield
as he issued from the palace from this
cloud burst an ear-splitting pandemo-
nium of sound it seemed that nothing
less than every war-ship in the world
could be engaged in battle

  the air was filled with shrieking
shells which hurtled through the rig-
ging of the ulysses but so far the
yacht had escaped any crippling damage
as she darted away to the westward
keeping the shore as close as was safe
schuyler turned his eyes toward the pal-
ace it was in flames smoke was al-
ready issuing from the upper windows
of the pinnacle even as he gazed a
shell struck the highest pinnacle which
collapsed in a cloud of dust

  at the sime time a fierce column of
flame suddenly leaped up against the blue
skies

   heaven help masefield  groaned
dicky schuyler turning away his head
aghast

  when the yacht was clear of the
greater danger of being struck by the
flying shells carlson turned to dicky
and the united states delegate with a
grin

   beats me  was all he said

   it is perfectly simple said kerr
 so simple that it is stupendous the
old feeling broke out apparently there
were never two ships of two different
nations anchored in the same waters
that something didnt blow up but
this-

  he flung his hands up dramatically in
the air

   youre all wrong said the swede
quietly  im not blind mr whats-
your-name

the cataclysm


the all-story magazine

   kerr said the human cork im-
perturbably

   kerr said carlson with a swift
puzzled glance  the navies didnt start
it where did the boatloads of hairy
fellows come from thats what i want
to know

  there was afight on the japanese
flag-ship presently the jap was seized
and the flag-ship fired on the connecticut
the whole united states navy seemed to
open fire a stray shell hit a german
and the germans let loose england
was the last but when she got going
the whole jig was up and-you see
for yourself 

  he waved his hand toward the dense
cloud which vomited fire and fury and
so this was the end of universal peace
but what was to be the end of this
universal war

  in a safe fathomage at a point
whence the men aboard the ulysses
could command a view of the coast east
and south the yacht hove to the men
on the bridge taking up their binoculars
scanned the shore for a sight of mase-
field and his friends

  a boat was dropped from the davits
all was therefore in readiness when the
party appeared from the woods and the
rifle-shot rang out

  the shot was heard distinctly the
fact brought the attention of carlson
to the other fact that the firing among
the war-ships had ceased there were
occasional rattles of small arms as if
fighting was going on upon the decks of
the various ships

   id give a lot to know what is hap-
pening behind that cloud of smoke
said carlson jamming his peaked cap
on the back of his head

  temples of isis exclaimed dicky
who was watching the approaching pin-
nace if he hasnt got the sidi with
him 

  which would indicate that dicky was
well informed of the true inwardness of
masefields love-affair in a few min-
utes the party was aboard

  masefield staggered breathlessly up the
gangway with the unconscious woman
held firmly in his arms reaching the
deck he turned sternly to carlson and
sharply ordered

   full steam ahead-for the open sea
get out of this as you value your life
and ours ahmed-to the bridge and
pilot 

  he disappeared below carrying his
precious burden dicky schuyler and
ahmed ran up the ladder to the bridge
they discovered carlson  leaning far
over the rail with binoculars riveted to
his eyes the mans pose was one of
rigid tenseness

  the breeze had freshened in the west
and the cloud of smoke was sweeping
away to the eastward already scores
of battle-ships were in full view the
navies of the world were somewhat les-
sened in number of ships by the fact
that many had been sunk but the fight-
ing fleet which survived that interna-
tional engagement was still of stupen-
dous size

  even as they stared at the armada of
steel the union jack fluttered to the
decks of the british sea-monster in-
stantly a mighty cheer rang out and a
great red flag was run up to the ships
peak

  in the name of heaven - whats
that demanded carlson cramming
the glasses into schuylers hands

  dicky looked then he said without
removing the glasses

   unless im blind its a red flag with
a big black hairy fist in the middle of
it

  and what does that mean cried
carlson

  it was ahmed aziz who replied

  his voice was quiet and calm but
there was no mistaking the depth of the
suppressed sorrow in it

   it means said he  that the en-
voys of peace are dead it means that
the brave officers who commanded that
fleet have been shot

   it means that the men who manned
these navies have been defeated or have
cast in their lot with the ruffians who
now hold the decks

   it means that the sheik anton com-
mands that great armada of steel and
that he will wage war against all man-
kind he will loot the world 

  and the world robbed of its defenses
was as helpless as a newborn babe in a
cradle

pod flits

by george allan england

 dditional proof that
 stone walls do not a prison
 make nor iron bars a cage j-

to pod slattery silling dejected in
his narrow cell in the ponkapog
county jail the rural turnkey
delivered a newspaper which had
been sent him so its wrapper said by one
p benyon new york city

  the wrapper was no longer on it for
warden tibbetts had ripped it off pre-
paratory to inspecting the paper lest in
its bulk be hidden some metal tool some
 dope  or other contraband but tib-
betts had discovered nothing though
he had scanned the whole paper sheet
by sheet he had found it innocent of
guile a certain blue-penciled article
had indeed arrested his suspicious eye
but it had been merely an account of a
riot at tammany hall

   nothin to object to here he had
said to turnkey bartlett  let him
have it so pod got the paper

  wearily he unfolded it

  no avid reader pod he was pining
for the open now that spring was com-
ing over the hill-longing for the good
green fields of graft where erstwhile
he and bender had so joyously disported
before that misplay of the old home-
stead had combined with his own defect-
ive sprinting qualities to land him in
the place of tin spoons striped clothing
and barred windows

   readin  he scoffed disgustedly
 who wants t- flash a lamp at readin
id like to know with all those tricks
just waitin to be trumped on the out-
side

  he yawned voluminously then his
dull eye caught the blue-penciling

  eh what he queried that
looks like news from home 

   he read the article all through squint-

ing in the dim light of the cell then
he turned the paper over and looked care-
fully at the back of it he passed his
fat finger over the surface a smile
broadened his good-humored face

   huh  he grunted  i guess thats
what it is all right all right-news 

  once more he scanned the text with
minute attention holding the paper close
to his eyes with one hand while with the
other he scratched his bald spot when
he had quite finished he held the paper
up to the dull square of light which
seeped in through the window from the
jail yard

  never in his life had his perceptions
been more keen here there in certain
letters of the print minute holes showed
mere tiny punctures with the finest of
needle-points

  long lovingly pod studied these
punctures dawning comprehension
brightened his smile half an hour or
more he studied by the fading light
then he nodded and with a sudden ac-
cess of joy noiselessly slapped his leg

  he heard the pad-pad-pad of the turn-
keys rubber soles coming down the cor-
ridor instantly he tore the paper into
bits and flung it on the concrete floor

   huh who th devil wants t read
stale news in here the turnkey heard
him growl disgustedly then came a
rattling of the cell-door

   hey there bo cant you give us
somethin that aint green with moss
pod hailed

   shut up in there you or ill report
ye  bartlett retorted as frowning he
made his way to the office

ii

  oxe week from that day a book came
to the ponkapog jail addressed to mr
william slattery and this too reached
his hands

  warden tibbetts of course looked it
all through but who could object to a

 


	the all-story magazine

series of essays on  moral regenera-
tion  by the rev kenneth blair

  pod let the turnkey see him dutifully
reading the first of these essays but that
afternoon at the early supper-hour he
 palmed  a tin spoon from the table
and took it with him to his cell

   before the lights were all put out at
nine oclock he had straightened the
handle of the spoon till it made a sort
of blade and had pried open the thick
pasteboard back cover of the volume

  from a little cavity deftly fashioned
there he withdrew a very thin tablet of
some reddish substance and a tiny cam-
els-hair brush these he hid under his
mattress

  the book after having carefully
pressed its cover together again and
rubbed the edge with pipe-ashes till the
split was hidden he stood on the little
corner shelf along with the compulsory
testament

  next morning he chewed his days
allowance of tobacco into a strong quid
and tucked it close up under his arm-
pit where he held it all day long and
in the quiet hour between eight and nine
when prying eyes were few he sought out
his brush and tablet

  wetting the brush in his mouth he
rubbed it on the tablet the brush grew
red

    anilins the stuff an no miss-play
at that  he murmured as with deft dabs
he spotted his face neck chest and arms
with a fine red  rash these he labored
over till they were perfect

  tell me they aint th goods
thought he   nothin you ever learn
bill but what may help you some time
my poor old mother used t say when i
was a kiddo and right she was

   that time i panhandled in bean-
town hung out in the retreat on t-
wharf and got hep to the gentle art of
jiggered arms and phony sores-say
what i learned then is the elixir now
eh these here eruptions take the dust-
microbes from none or im a preacher
theyll keep me several laps in the lead
over old tibbetts all right till we un-
cover a few oddities 

   he finished his task once more hid the
tablet and the brush then wrapped him-
self in his blanket and lay down in his
bunk with a low groan

    that groan comes pretty near bein
the genuine goods he pondered  fact
is the quids beginnin to bite by
mornin therell be a sick pod in this jail
no white-powder trance about that
well let er happen im ready-if ben
is

   he snuggled the tobacco closer under
his arm and composed himself to sleep

    gee but im dizzy now i stop to
notice it  he murmured  therell
sure be a sick pod by breakfast-time

iii

  there was a sick pod very sick
actively and noisily sick by midnight
sleep had quite abandoned him by 
am his groans were echoing with un-
simulated wo through the corridors of
ponkapog jail

  by three-though he made no demand
for help-the night-watchman realized
that oaths and threats and commands to
 dry up in there an go t sleep 
availed nothing by three-thirty the
warden himself roused from slumber
was standing over pod a lantern in one
hand and a clinical thermometer in the
other

   he didnt intend to be fooled by any
malingerer not he

   no doctor could be had at that unholy
hour save by telephoning over to hamp-
ton center eight miles away where the
county pest-house was judson atkins
the jail physician was off to a convention
on hospital practise at rutland ward-
en tibbetts therefore officiated

  whats th matter with ye hey
he demanded prodding the sufferer

   he had no love for this fat quizzical
prisoner of his who could on occasion
discourse freely in the most extraordinary
language on rural characteristics

   come speak up thar whats
wrong 

   pod only groaned and heaved wrapped
the blanket round his head and breathed
heavily in staccato time

    wnt talk you i think yere tryin
t hornswoggle me thats what i think
ive seed sech doins afore callate
this here thermometer will tell 

  he twitched the blanket from pods
face while the night-watchman stood be-
hind him holding the lantern and thrust
pod flits



the little glass tube under the lolling
tongue pod sick as he really was
rolled his eyes horribly and added a little
quiver to the groans

  thar now well see exclaimed
tibbetts presently withdrawing the tube
he held it close to the lantern and
squinted at it turning it this way then
that to catch the magnification of the
mercury

  what one hundred an two an a
half an pulse runnin like a tarnation
race-horse je-n-salem say jack-
son  reckon as how this here man has
got somethin crossways in his gizzard
here gimme that light will ye  

  he held the lantern close to pods dis-
torted face and scanned it narrowly a
whistle escaped his puckered lips he
pulled down the blanket ripped open
pods coarse shirt and surveyed his fat
chest a growing fear in his eyes

   my lord but i-i wish- groaned
pod

   wish what you 

  wish id-oh my head-been
vaccinated fore i ever left new york
it-ulihli-run out last year my-last
vaccination did 

  warden tibbetts dropped his lantern
crashing to the floor and backed away
in sudden sickening fear

   you-you jackson-youve had it
aready aint ye he gasped

   sure i have  answered the watch-
man gathering up the lantern just in
time to save it from going out  twelve
years ago last fall i-

    all right all right  cried tibbetts
retreating out of the cell  youre th
man t see this through not me ill git
a wagon you wrap him up good an
hustle him out o here pdq see
dont take him through the office take
him out th back way we got t git him
over to th center right off quick 

  from well outside the place of dread
he gave his orders in a tremulous voice
no more critical inspection for him

   gee but its lucky hes a coward an
the lights poor  reflected pod between
groans

  all up and down the dark corridor
bunks were creaking cell-doors rattling
lugubrious voices asking

  whats th row somebody dyin
hey bo put us wise

  somebody answered  smallpox 
and a general gasp pervaded the night
air

   git him out hurry hurry  re-
peated tibbetts executing a well-covered
retreat toward the office two minutes
later he was rousing big jim butts the
prison hostler and ordering out the ex-
press-wagon

   oh my what you goin t do with
me blubbered pod you aint goin
to-take me to th-pest-house arc
you  

    sure i be  answered jackson cheer-
fully

  no no protested the sick man
with pitiable terror not there any
place but there oh why cant you
lemme die in peace right here

   we aint a worryin none bout your
dyin jackson assured him as he
wrapped the extra blanket close about
pods quivering form  its th jail were
thinkin of cant have that infested y
see

   hev t fumigate it now as it is
come on nov set up git yer feet to
th floor ill help ye you kin still
walk a bit cant ye 

  walk nah wont neither no
pest-house fer mine 

   in vain jackson pleaded urged threat-
ened expostulated only when he had
commandeered a trembling panic-strick-
en prisoner and with his help lugged the
groaning feebly struggling two hundred
and eighty pounder by main force down
the corridor and through the back
entrance did pod slattery leave the
ponkapog county jail

iv

  away in the chill dark of that early
april morning drove the little party
headed for hampton center big jim
butts drove the official mare jackson
sat beside him spitting tobacco-juice be-
tween stray bits of conversation and in
the bottom of the wagon tightly wrapped
in two thick blankets lay the prostrate
and complaining pod

  warden tibbetts did not appear to see
the party off already with panic haste
he was getting out the sulfur - candles
and filling the jail with strangling cho-
king fumes


the all-story magazine

  the village was asleep as they drove
through it at a walk the houses were
all dark no life showed itself save
a lone barking cur and a matutinal
chanticleer or two

   over the frozen ruts the wagon jolted
to the accompaniment of the sick mans
groaping out of the town it passed
and turning to the south at the sign-
boards headed for hampton center

  jackson had he bothered to look
round might have seen his invalid reach
in under the coarse shirt withdraw some-
thing from his arm-pit and fling it away
but jackson saw nothing he was too
busy with reminiscences of his own small-
pox siege twelve years ago

  by the time the wagon had traversed
four miles pod found his health notably
bettered the absence of the poisoning
quid helped him the fresh air revived
him and a certain expectant eagerness
stimulated his returning strength he
forgot now and then to groan

  sinkin is he queried big jim
butts

   seems like the watchman answered
no matter what th devil do we care
were doin our jooty anyhow aint
we

  he clucked to the mare and urged her
to a lumbering trot

  another mile passed the road took
a curve and plunged into babbetts
woods on the other side of which lay
hampton

   dark in here aint it commented
jim flicking his whip at an overbending
spruce bough

  there came no answer for all at once
the roadside bushes crackled and in the
semidusk jackson and butts saw a small
crouching man run with unsteady steps
back into the woods dodging from tree
to tree as though to hide himself

    i swow  what th tarnations that  
cried jim reining the mare to a stand-
still  sheep-thief or hobo or-

   i dunno somethin wrong abaout
it anyhow   jackson replied  hey
you   he shouted  halt there in the
name o the law  

  the fugitive sank to earth and dis-
appeared in the dark undergrowth
they lost all sight of him

    shall we drive on  asked jim

   not by a gosh-blamed sight  jack-

son retorted he was keen for laurels
and promotion  no sirree you wait
here ill ketch th cuss an see whathes
up to anyhow

  over the wheel he leaped through the
brushwood he crashed and with cautious
circumspection made his way toward the
spot where the stranger had seemed to
hide as he went rustling last falls
dead leaves underfoot he called out
warnings commands and challenges

   dont hurt me leave me be  rose
a voice from a little dell off a couple of
hundred feet to the left  i aint done
nothin to you  

   thats all right what youve done
er aintdone roared jackson suddenly
emboldened by the fugitives evident fear
and weakness  youre a spicious char-
acter thats what ye be yeou come
along o me savvy i arrest ye in th
name o the state o verhampshire 

  the man lay quite still cringing and
terrified jackson strode up to him big
jim craning his neck from the wagon
could just barely make out the watch-
mans figure

   get up  commanded jackson kick-
ing him

   oooh dont please   begged the
man jackson saw that he was slight
and ragged and in apparent pain
 taint my fault if im sick an aint
got no home nor place t go lemme
be

  	sick be ye  lets see reckon
yeou be sicker fore im through with
ye 

  jackson knelt beside the prostrate
form something flashed the watch-
man with hair-bristling fear found him-
self looking right into the round cold
mouth of a blue revolver-a mouth that
seemed big as a young cannon to his ter-
rified eyes

  what-what- he stammered
the fugitive sat up and with fearful
earnestness exclaimed  make me sicker
will you well see about that look
here you blundering yahoo if you want
to live you do just what i tell you now
and do it quick see  

   i-i-all right-what 

   put your two hands out here no
closer together there thats- right
now hold em so shut your eyes
tight 
pod flits



                 there came a click another one jack-
               son felt something cold upon his wrists

               bracelets  he groaned gosh
            amighty whats up

                 the slight man with the blue revolver
vouchsafed no answer all he said was
 now stand up against that hemlock
	there no not that one-the other be

             quick or-

                all right i will dont shoot
	mister 

                and the erstwhile valiant one backed
              up with an exceeding meekness to a tow-
              ering conifer a minute later the slight
              man had lashed him firmly to it with a
              hank of braided rope thin rope but very
              strong then with deft speed he gagged
              the captive with a rough stick and some
              linen twine his hands were none too
              tender and the twine cut jacksons flesh
              but jackson never whimpered for the
              fear of death was strong upon him

                  the slight man whistled twice a shrill
               note and started toward the road

               big jim butte his suspicions well
             aroused that something was amiss
             dropped the reins and started to clamber
             down from the wagon but just as his
             foot touched the top of the wheel a
             strange thing happened up from be-
             hind him rose a huge inchoate form vast
             in bulk shedding blankets right and left
             staggering it rose dizzy with anguish yet
             terrible in determination

                clad only in rough prison underwear
              pallid with contracted features this ap-
              parition hurled itself on jim from the
              rear before the driver could so much as
              turn not by dint of blows but just with
              sheer impact of weight the mighty form
              hurled butts to earth fell atop of him
              then clung crushing the very breath out
              of him  im bad no wind for even a sec-
              ond cry of  help  

                help was fast coming though not for
              jim the slight and agile man crying
              hold him pod hold him burst
              out of the woods into the road and jim

	butts too found himself inspecting the

               blue muzzle of the 

                  you can get up now said the slight
               man

              swered dizzy say my cocos

  he leaned against the wagon panting

  jim gasping for breath blinked at the
revolver

it

   sure i understand bender assented
 get up peel 

   huh

   stand up and get your clothes off
pdq or ill make a salt-shake out of
you  got it  

  utterly dazed big jim arose

  five minutes later he too wrapped in
blankets was standing in the woods
bound fast to a tree and gagged with his
own handkerchief

   well send somebody for you before
night  was benders parting shot as
he and pod climbed into the wagon and
with a sharp cut of the lash started the
mare down the dusky road through the
woods

v

  ben drove while pod with haste and
more agility than seemed compatible with
one so fat and recently so ill clambered
into the clothes of big jim

   now you take the ribbons pod said
ben and straightway he effected his
disguise by simply peeling off his ragged
gear and flinging it into the woods
underneath a clean whole suit appeared
ben drew a cap from his pocket and the
transformation was complete

   gee ben but youre the nifty slicke-
rine  commented pod with wonder-
ment  weve sure got the fun-ball
circling now 

   but not pocketed as yet ben an-
swered  remember its nine miles to

   forget it ive got something down
on the dope-sheet worth ten of that just
you wait and keep the optics skinned
say but it worked didnt it eh oh a
pip all fitted together like a jig-saw
puzzle tibbetts ha ha

   took th hook line sinker pole an
all scared green too did a quick re-
verse when he saw ihe spots

   dont blame him slickest make-up
ever so smooth it took all curves with-
out a jar-except to tibb  co theres
more show-me happenings stamped with
the hap-brand too dated to arrive just
wait 

  joyfully discussing tilings past pres-
ent future they drove on and  at the
mares best speed half a mile from the
scene of the liold-up they passed a farmer
driving in with milk to hampton he
eyed them keenly butdid not molest
them

  hang this dawn-stunt  growled
pod if it was only midnight now-
why aint i a joshua

  even in the deep woods they could see
that the light was growing very strong
the sun would be up now any time at
a little brook running beneath the road
they paused for a drink and a wash which
served the double purpose of refreshing
them and removing pods anilin rash

  quick convalescence eh smiled
ben as they once more set forward and
turned into a cross-road leading over the
hills to rawlins

   surest thing you know   assented
pod  nobody could stay sick long
with your patent get-there line o reme-
dies

  the woods thinned out and finally

gave place to cleared land as they kept
eastward morning had now fully come
and with it a revival of life in farm-
houses and along the road ben urged
the old mare forward plain to see he
chafed under the rural scrutiny pod
too was anxious

  just outside a little settlement which
straggled down a hillside they came to
an old church set far back from the road
in a grove of cypress to the left of it
stood a tumble-down hearse-house ben
drove into the yard and reined the mare
to a standstill beside this structure

   here we are get out  he re-
marked  heres the place i picked

  pod climbed ponderously down he
and ben forced the door with a couple
of vigorous shoves and peered in

  good still there said ben
 you unharness ill run it out he
seized the shafts of the old-fashioned
solid-sided vehicle

  presently the wagon was in the hearse-
house and the hearse was hitched to the
official mare they closed the door
again nobody had seen them-so at
least they thought

   now pod heres the dido i havent
put you lucid to as yet i you go now
quick 

  in in where

    in there  

  what me in that cold-meat cart
with not even a window to peek out
of	

   thats the program youre dead-
of smallpox-see

  pod spluttered protests but ben stood
firm  get in you stiff what rights
a cadaver to talk back eh here ill
help you up so n ow remember what-
ever happens not a word out o you or
its all off

  a minute later ben was on the seat
looking very lugubrious and the hearse
weighted to the limit of its springs was
swaying and jolting out of the church-
yard behind the somnolescent equine

vi

  ben turned back from the settlement
back over the hill and soon had the satis-
faction of seeing the last of the church-
spire with the morning sun gilding its
tip down the first cross-road running
east he turned and urged the mare into
a trot

  the hearse bounced and rocked yaw-
ing heavily into the ruts and coming up
into the wind as it were with a strong
list as its ponderous cargo shifted a
groan now and then issued from the
stuffy box but ben rapped on its top
with his whip-handle commanding si-
lence farmhouses were scattered all
along the road and he could not afford
to risk such a luxury on pods part as
groaning

  they had proceeded a couple of miles
and already bens spirits were rising high
-for the railroad now lay less than an
pod flits



hours travel ahead and with this change
of equipage all chances seemed in their
favor-when a disconcerting set-back
brought the frowns to the drivers keen
face

  they were just passing a farm ben
driving decorously with hat pulled low
over his eyes when a gaunt woman
appeared at the door of a wood-shed and
scanned the hearse with knitted brows
and hand on hip there were telephone-
wires leading into the house

   cy cy  ben heard her call
 come here quick  

  ben kept his pose and never so much
as jerked a rein but his heart leaped a
man appeared in the doorway

   i snum ef it aint  ben heard him
say in answer to some inaudible remark
of the womans  ill hook up an
see 

   oh youll see will you  thought
ben he had passed now out of sight
of the house so he lashed the mare to a
sharp trot

   somebody must be wise he thought
 somebody must have piped the game
and curse these rural telephones for
gossip well if weve got to do the
dash weve got to do it thats all come
on there come  once more the whip-
lash whistled

  ben felt that the true character of his
freight was still quite unsuspected
surely the time had been too short for
the whole truth to leak but none the
less if he were suspected merely of steal-
ing the settlement hearse that would
bring on most fatal complications

   got to beat it thats all  said he

  around the bends he drove at a good
lick the old hearse creaking jolting and
careering heavily a long hill he saw
lay before him down into the valley at
whose lower end lay rawlins the rail-
road deliverance he thanked his stars
for the long hill that would speed him
half a mile or more on his way vigor-
ously he laid on the whip the old mare
kicked up her heels and hit the grit in
earnest

  and now the hearse lunged into a mad
career loose rocks and gravel flew
dust rose in the morning sunlight springs
complained and loose spokes rattled

  every  thank-you-maam  sent the
crazy rattletrap bounding into air to

come down a-slew and right itself with
wild eccentric gyrations

  the pace quickened the old hearse
freighted as never before hurled itself
down the hill devouring space faster
and faster as it neared the bottom

  ben laughing aloud laying on the
whip where it would do the most good
glanced back his laughter ceased and
a strong word filled his mouth behind
him just topping the hill some half a
mile in the rear plainly visible against
the sky-line he caught sight of a pur-
suing wagon he saw the drivers arm
rise fall and knew the rod was nowise
being spared

   go it cresceus  he shouted to the
now terrified mare and rained down
blows

  the hearse struck a hummock some-
thing went smash and shrill cries rang
out-wild inarticulate cries ben haul-
ing vainly on the ribbons looked round
he saw the roadway strewn with boards
ascatter

   good lord  the bottoms out 
he cried  pods running in the
hearse 

  then as he looked a huge and rotund
figure fell astern rolled ricochetted
sprawled bounced and came to rest it
struggled up and lunged into a stagger-
ing run after the fleeing equipage with
wild yells dusty disheveled

   whoa emma whoa  roared ben
jerking the reins savagely the mare
obeyed slower and slower the hearse
went then stopped still

  ben jumped from the seat and ran
back

   hurt he cried

   hurt nothin but say-what-

   cut the questions pod theyre
after us weve got to make a diversion
of some sort and hike across-lots he
that 

  he held up a warning finger pod
listened panting far up the hill out
of sight around its sweep came a rattle
of loose stones

   yaps coming  be here in three min-
utes quick that hay 

  ben pointed at a lop-sided old hay-
stack by the roadside

    quick  stuff the hearse 

  without waiting for explanations he
dived for the stack and came back with


the all-story magazine

a heaping armful iod questioning not
imitated him into the hearse they
crammed it enough bottom-boards re-
mained to hold it in its place

   now a match  hurry  hurry 

  the match went fsss ben thrust it
into the hay a tiny flame leaped up
then thickened and threw out yellow
smoke

  all right let er go cried ben
 duck for the woods 

  he gave the mare a fierce final cut of
the lash

   get up  go on there you   he
shouted and kicked her in the ribs she
terrified beyond all measure leaped into
a wild run

  flaming like a meteor with a long
demise trail of smoke streaming behind
the blazing apparition hurled itself into
the valley

  down down  cried bender
seizing pod and hauling him behind a
tangled growth of birch and hardback

  barely hidden from sight of the road
they heard the dash and rattle of their
pursuers wagon then came another
and a third profane astonished yells
rose on the air

  hells loose thar goes-th fust
load-naow  a high-pitched nasal voice
shouted in mingled fear and amaze

  quite still lay pod and ben no more
wagons passed gradually peace de-
scended on the spring landscape

   come on bo lets beat it for the
uncut  chuckled pod at length

  right-o im with you answered
ben

  they got cautiously to their feet and
started for the woods which lay a quarter
of a mile back of the road

   thatll hold em for an hour or two
that hell-buggy will grinned the ex-
invalid

   longer than that ben opined  or
i dont know the jay psychology and
by that time let em find us-if they
can

   theres other stations besides raw-
lins and other south-bound night freights
besides the one that stops there give us
a freight and the two phony-cards ive
got in my pocket and-

   and its broadway for ours a one
best bet  exclaimed the radiant pod as
they disappeared into the sheltering
forest

chapter xiii

who killed bompard

the match dropped from bur-
roughss fingers and he stood
glaring through the darkness at
simone

   he has tricked you he chided
 you should have been sure what are
we going to do now

   go to his own house she answered
   you know where that is 

   i told you that i knew all the under-
 world of tangier if the jew had
 known who was following him he might
 have spared himself some trouble or
 have given me more

   but suppose he is not at his house 
  we can try

   is it far

   in this street he was nearly home
before he tried this trick

they hurried out and in a little while

began april all-story

magazine



they stood before the same door which
an hour previous elise and the jew had
entered

  youre sure this is the place

   yes this is it are you afraid 
burroughs looked up at the blank
walls of the house as if to question
them of their secrets  the only fear
that amounts to anything is the kind
that makes you turn back he answered
and put his hand to the door

  it was fastened from the inside
and now what he queried are
we going to call him out or break in
simone hesitated

  jean she said he is a dangerous
man i am afraid of him but we will
stand together whatever happens

   yes jerked out burroughs  what-
ever happens we dont believe much in
evil eyes in my town and i dont think
hell have a chance to exert it if i get
my hands on him first

single copies  cents


tie all-story magazine

   but you must not kill him-that is
not until he has told where the letters
are she added naively

   what happens to him will depend
on what has happened to miss dexter

   but you are going to help me get
the letters

   to the last ditch said burroughs

  simone lifted her hand and knocked

  no answer

  then burroughs applied his knuckles
and they could hear the raps echoing
from the hollow place within still
there was no answer

  youre sure this is the place the
young man asked for the third time

   yes yes

  his response to this was to lay his
shoulder to the door

   you will frighten them and they
will escape by the roof

   they are already warned he ex-
claimed excitedly and stepping back
hurled his body against the cedar planks

  the result was the pop of a broken
fastening and the two rushed in
through the dark little courtyard they
hurried up the stairs to a room where a
candle burned the flame flickered to
the draft made by their entrance but
it was the only moving thing present

  burroughs snatched the candle from
its socket and holding it high above
his head with one hand while he grasped
liis cocked revolver in the other he
started to search the house simone fol-
lowed closely

  in the previous happenings of the
evening she had taken the initiative but
now she showed her willingness to let the
man lead

  they entered room after room all
were empty and burroughs pressed on
to the housetop as he mounted the
steps a puff of air blew out the flame
he did not stop to rekindle it and
when he reached the roof there was 
need light was already provided

  a three-weeks-old  had lifted its
scarred face above the horizon every-
thing about was clearly discernible there
was  sign of a fugitive

  the artist ran across the roof to the
nearest parapet and sent his glance
searching in all directions everything
was quiet

  as he stood looking conscious of the

fact that the girl he sought was not
there he gradually lost the idea of the
search and the picture itself gripped him

  this was a new world of tangier
the whole of the place seemed sprinkled
with powdered silver while here and
there were tints borrowed from the pearl
shell and the turquoise not far away
a minaret lifted a pale blue filament of
shadow against the silver light

  far down he could hear the drone of
the sea and could detect the faint white
sparkle of the waves as they came in to
beat murmurously against the sea-wall
in the air above he saw the moving
shadow of a night-bird and a light tink-
ling note dropped out of the heavens
he breathed deeply and the air was tonic
to his lungs it braced and steadied him
he stretched his arms and found that
his shoulder no longer pained him

  the sense of beauty touched him only
for a moment he jumped down and
hurried back to where simone stood

   we have lost them if they were ever
here he said despairingly

   we can search the house perhaps
i can find the letters

  he snapped his fingers impatiently
he did not care for the letters he want-
ed to see elise to know the truth about
her for now that he had some trace of
her his fears were graver than before
there was nothing to do however but to
follow the frenchwoman down into the
dark house where he relit the candle and
handed it to her

  she looked about the place carefully
and then pronounced decidedly yes
this is his house i know that cloak
hanging there i have seen him wear it
with that she began to examine the
clothes that hung on the wall while bur-
roughs stood still in the middle of the
room watching she went through the
garments turned over bedding opened
the drawers of the table looked every-
where for the letters finally she
turned to him with her hands spread
wide in perplexity

   no use

   whats to do

   we can wait for them they must
come back

   wait snapped the artist  and
while we are waiting the world ma
blow up im going down
the yellow sard



   but what good will that do where
will you go

   anywhere to try to find them-to
lay the matter before the authorities
he bolted out of the room and the
woman followed close

  they were at the outer door again
and had halted for a second to decide
which way to go when simone pointed
down the street

  sst she warned some one is
coming it may be the jew

  a moment later a mans form swung
out of the shadows

   it is he she whispered  care-
ful we must let him get in

  they stumbled back through the pas-
sage and shrinking against the wall
waited the mans entrance he paused
a long time at the outer door apparently
suspicious because he found it open

  then they heard him moving cautious-
ly toward-the stairs fortunately his
desire to reconnoiter was in their favor
for he did not use his hand-lamp his
garments almost brushed them as he
crept past and burroughs fully expected
that he would give himself away by his
breathing

  the jews senses however were all
centered on the rooms above where he
expected trouble if there was any the
two stalked him more silently than he
went himself and when he entered the
candle-lit room they paused at the door-
way watching

  the absence of elise and his wife
roused immediate suspicion he stopped
abruptly his head lifted his black eyes
searching around him

   irene he called softly

  burroughs his eye to the opening be-
tween the curtains felt the woman be-
side him shudder  her hand groped at his
side till she found his and she nestled
her own within it like a child asking for
protection

  she was afraid of the mysterious evil
eye and for a second her fear was com-
municated to her companion he real-
ized that they were about to face an un-
known danger

  it was one thing to laugh at evil eyes
as long as you felt yourself a good
american and were in a region where the
laws of the west held good this was
another world so for a second his doubt

   	s

came back as her cold fingers slid into
his and he felt her body pressing him
close

  he had had the fear before and had
conquered it this was no time for
hesitation he must act and the next
thought - that this man knew where
elise was-sent the courage rolling back
through his veins like new blood

  irene the jew called again and
started across the room

   stay here counseled burroughs and
stepped out to confront the man

  as the latter looked into the nose of
a thirty-eight he jumped back with a cry
of astonishment

   shut up  said the young man
roughly and then in french he added
 hold up your hands 

  the jew hesitated for the click of a
clock then his hands came slowly up
above his head and a smile curled at his
thin lips the craftiness of the smile
somehow put burroughs in a panic

  he had been forcing himself to an
attitude that he was not quite sure of
and as soon as he felt the mans hard
and compelling gaze on him the memory
of simones fears regarding the duel
they were entering on began to play
havoc with his nerve he dared not
shift his eyes from his opponent lest the
latter leap at him or draw a weapon

  and now the jews hands with their
long tapering fingers began to move
downward as if they were to be extend-
ed above the americans head in an
attitude of benediction but it was no
blessing that the man pronounced

  he put one foot forward and leaned
slightly toward his victim he thrust his
face near him till he seemed to envelop
the others personality by his own

   xou cant shoot he announced in
very clear english  put down that
pistol 

  it was just what burroughs had ex-
pected and he had thought he was ready
for it but the mans will was stronger
than his own he tried to pull the trig-
ger but even as he made the effort he
knew that he would fail

  he set his teeth and fought the influ-
ence the jew advanced one step and
spoke the words again in a low tone of
command slowly burroughs lowered
the revolver


the all-story magazine

  the others tense face relaxed to an
evil grin it faded as simones voice
cut the silence she had gone round by
the little gallery and come upon the
man in the rear she had him covered
with her revolver but her voice quav-
ered a little as she cried

   stop 

  the jew spun round like a flash and
his hand went to his breast for a
weapon

   hold up your hands or ill shoot 
she ordered

  the jew laughed

   you cant  he snapped shifting his
position one step so that by a slight turn
of the head he could face either of his
adversaries

  burroughs caught his breath with a
half-sob as the mans eyes left him it
was as if a weight had been taken from
his brain his own will again came
within calling distance

  as for the jew he was between two
fires and was making the extraordinary
attempt to control two people at once
he turned again to the american and
once more simones voice warned him
her tone was not so imperative as at
first still it was a command

  if you do not sit down and cover
your face i will shoot i will give you
three

  the evil eyes caught hers bur-
roughs felt his own freedom increase
he was beginning to understand the
jew was nothing but a good hypnotist
whom superstition had invested with
miraculous powers he might control
one subject but the american did not
believe he could manage two

  the instant he told himself that his
own will got dominion anger white-
hot anger against the man who was
playing with him blazed in his veins
he saw the jews hand lifted toward
simone with its gentle wave-like mo-
tion he jumped toward him

  the jew saw the movement and faced
about a knife glittered in his hand
but he was too late to avoid the ameri-
cans long swing the latters fist land-
ed squarely on the point of the hyp-
notists jaw and he tumbled in a sorry
heap on the floor

   dont kill him called simone

   he wont give any more trouble

announced burroughs with the cheerful
certitude of one who has gained a point
and sees himself master  give me that
piece of cloth

  he knelt over the half-conscious man
and pinioned his arms while simone
ran out to the gallery and returned with
a water-bottle from which she sprinkled
a few drops on the jews face he
sniffed and opened his eyes as bur-
roughs picked him up bodily and de-
posited him on the dirty divan

   now my friend said the artist
 well have no more of this darned
nonsense youll please keep your eyes
on the floor and if you try any more of
this evil-eye business ill break your
jaw next time

  the jew glanced under his brows at
the two who were covering him with
their revolvers from opposite sides of
the room he groveled he was
caught and conquered the weapon
he had always found so effective had
failed him and he was without resource
for physical he was a coward

   what have i done  he whined

   where is the american girl who
was with you to-night  

   i left her here have you not
found her

   i was protecting her perhaps she
has gone back to her friends i would
have taken her back to-morrow it was
not safe for a foreign woman to be alone
at night where i found her so i brought
her home i did not harm her

  where are the letters cut in
simone

  the jew looked dazed

   i do not know what you mean she
had  letters

   dont lie she said  i am not
talking of what she had

  sweeping across the room she thrust
her hand into his mantle her whole
attitude toward him had changed she
had seen him conquered and she 
longer had any fear

  ever since she had seen the jew in
savarys house she had hesitated in her
quest allowing burroughs to take the
lead now she resumed her old air of
command she gave no heed to his pro-
tests but searched him thoroughly even
making him take off his shoes and run-
ning her knife between the soles to make
the yellow sard



sure that there was nothing concealed
there

  her search was unrewarded not a
scrap of paper was brought to light at
one moment it almost seemed that she
was going to strike the man in her dis-
appointment

  what have you done with them
she demanded  have you sold them
already or have you hidden them

   i swear by the beard of abraham
that i took nothing from the young lady
i found her in the hands of some moors
and i rescued her

  then why is she not here inter-
posed burroughs

   perhaps she has escaped i do not
know but i took nothing from her
 dont try to deceive me went on
simone  i am not talking of anything
you took from the young lady i am
talking of the letters to muley-hafid if
you have hidden them and will give them
up  will pay you and i promise to let
you go free

  the man uttered another protestation
 but i do not know what you mean
 swear again that  have no letters

   the evidence is too strong against
you look at this she stepped up
to him and thrust the yellow sard in his
face

  his jaw fell

  then you have it but it is not
mine i am not a spy of muleys

   you do not deny that you sold the
ring to a goldsmith within the last twen-
ty-four hours

   but it was not mine  did not
know what it was i came on it by-
by accident

  simone smiled her theory was
proving true

   i thought so you stole it and for
some reason sold it but you were so
anxious to get it back that you went to
the house of savary the frenchman
and searched a mans body for it

   then it was you whom i sensed
there he exclaimed  it was you
who followed us

   and now will you deny that it was
you who murdered bompard the other
frenchman and who stole his watch and
his ring and the letter 

  then there were letters taken he
asked with sudden craftiness

   if you deny it again- she men-
aced

   but it was not i who took them
he protested  it was not i who mur-
dered him wait he cricd as simone
made a threatening move toward him-
 wait i did steal the ring and the
watch i confess i did not know the
value of the ring and i sold it then
 found out by accident and i tried
to get it back to sell again to those who
could use it that was why  went to
savarys house but the letters i
know nothing of letters the man who
did the murder must have them

   and you were the man who else
could be guilty 

   the man from whom i took the ring
and the watch perhaps

   but you took them from bompard
 no not from bompard though i
knew him

   from whom then if you lie it
will go hard with you from whom
 from the wall-eyed frenchman
alphonse savary

chapter xiv

which killed bompard

  if the jew had let off a bomb he could
not have created more consternation than
he did by his words

  simone turned quickly to burroughs
but the latter laughed

   see here my friend he said  lets
have done with this nonsense

   i am telling the truth shrilled the
man  i know nothing of the murder
of bompard nor of his letters the ring
and the watch and a little money i had
from savary find him and ask him
where he got the ring

  burroughs was about to speak but
simone stopped him by a gesture

   wait let us hear your story she
said to the jew  but be quick

   i got them from savary

   the whole story

  burroughs stood impatiently while the
jew continued in arabic

   it was last night i was in a cafe
watching the dancing-girls i sat near
the platform for the place was crowded
there were plenty of moors and there
were a few foreigners whose guides had


the all-story magazine

brought them there was good dancing
raeina the desert girl was there and the
jewess from fez it was good dancing

   late-very late-a man came in and
shouldered up toward the platform he
wore a red fez and his burnoose was
drawn over his face but i saw his bad
eye and  knew savary he had been
drinking and was not himself lie sat
very close to me and he seemed to be
thinking of something besides the dan-
cing for his eyes were far away at last
he went out and i followed him to his
house and when he slept  entered for
i knew he was in liquor and would not
be dangerous

    got the watch and the ring he
had laid them on the table the ring
was made for a large man and i think
it did not fit him so he could not wear
it but i could not find his money it
was concealed in his shirt

   in the morning i sold the ring and
later when i went to sell the watch i
found out what the ring was i did not
know before i conceived the idea of
getting it back if it belonged to muley-
hafid it was worth money i found the
english girl she had been seized by-
spies who were keeping her for a re-
ward i rescued her and brought her
here to-morrow i would have taken
her back to her friends

  burroughs stood eying the two while
the man spoke he chafed at the delay

    it is true protested the jew  if
the ring was bompards ask savary how
he got it

  simone ruminated for a minute
then blowing out her breath with a
sharp puff she rapidly translated the
story to her companion

   i wonder she finished musingly
 it is a strange tale

    he is simply trying to trick us ob-
jected burroughs

   i wonder

   but if savary had the ring why did
he pretend to think it was taken from
bompard  

   what if savary took it himself

   but-

   what if he killed him

    he has been hot on my trail because
he says i killed him

   perhaps to draw suspicion from him-
self

   burroughs whistled

    i can see that it is not impossible
 he did not like bompard her lashes
 dropped languidly and a slight smile
 came to her red lips he was jealous
 i knew that but  did not think it had
 gone that far perhaps it is true

   for a while she seemed to forget the
 jew as she went back in her brain put-
 ting things together that would sustain
 the new hypothesis that had suddenly
 upset all their plans

     yes she said finally  it is possible
 that he killed bompard and took the ring
 and the letters to make it appear that
 robbery was the motive

    but what was he going to do with
 the ring and the letters they would be
 of no use to him alone and if he mere-
 ly wanted to show robbery he would
 have taken only the watch and the
 money then his tracks would have
 been covered and he could have gone on
 and worked with the rest of you in car-
 rying out the plot there must be some
 other reason behind his keeping the let-
 ters-if he has them which i doubt

    perhaps he meant to play traitor

 but why

    to spite me and for the money abd-
 el-aziz would pay a price for the letters
 for to have them miscarry would upset
 all the pretenders plans

    if you want to know what i think
 about it said burroughs  it is that
 this man here is lying in order to save
 his own mutton it is easy to lay it on
 savary when he isnt here

    we must confront them with each
 other if savary has the letters we have
 savary

    how if he has already disposed of
 them 

   she clapped her hands with a sudden
 inspiration  he hasnt she averred
 decidedly  dont you see he in-
 tended to sell them yesterday but the
 theft of the ring balked him he need-
 ed both to make a good bargain that
 was why he kidnaped you and having
 got the ring lie persisted about the let-
 ters in order to hoodwink dupre then
 came your fight in his room and he was
 still without the letters

    it seems impossible

    and we must prove its possibility
 we must go to savary
the yellow sard



  burroughs came back to his own quest
 liut the american girl lie urged-
 where is she  

   i left her here with my wife

   but you have an idea where she is
gone

   i do not know but i can search for
her if you will let me go i will find
her

   very good said burroughs  ill
go with you

  the jew smiled

   yes he said  if the gentleman will
go with me i will find her

  simone interrupted

   not alone jean you shall not go
with him alone he will trick you you
would never come back alive there
must be some other way come with me
to get the letters from savary and then
we will think what to do

   and in the meantime she will be
lost

   but it is suicide to follow him and
even if we went together he could lead
us into a trap as easy as a hunter baits
a boar

  burroughs glimpsed the jews sly
look and he knew the truth of the
statement he knew that he didnt
want to be alone with that man it
gave him the creeps as he recalled his
helplessness when the jew had stood
before him and waved his hand

   you must not trust him pleaded
simone  go with me to confront
savary and then you can go back to
the pasha and raise the alarm it is
the only way look i am thinking
only of you when i ask it go with
me this last time jean and then go
back to your own people go with
me

  she leaned toward him and her bare
white arm shaking free its loose sleeve
went to his neck for the second time
that night her lips were close to his
and her attitude was of invitation

  and burroughs knew that she was
playing on his senses he knew that
despite her words she still hoped to
win the look that she wanted and
he knew too that in spite of his saner
instincts the love of this woman
thrilled and called to him

  he forgot the captive jew  he
knew only that simone colet was

breathing near him and that her tropic
beauty was working on his pulses as
the smoldering fire of wine

 in another instant their lips would
have touched but the cry of a woman
-a half sob - came to him from the
outer gallery

  the jew stiffened on his mattress
simone whirled like a machine bur-
roughs stood erect and listened

  there was no further sound

  then both simone and burroughs
bounded toward the door and drew
back the curtain another womans cry
echoed in the darkness and there was
the swish of moving drapery

  without stopping to think bur-
roughs dashed in its direction as he
bounded down the stairs he was aware
of a figure flying before him they
reached the court the form moving
like a ghost in the darkness was ten
paces ahead it plunged into the pas-
sage and reached the outer door which
was swinging ajar just the second re-
quired to pull it wide open was the sec-
ond the pursuer needed he seized a
womans mantle and the wearer turned
and struck him in the face with her
hand

  before she could repeat the blow he
had pinioned both her arms and was
carrying her back to the light in the
room where simone and the jew were
waiting he set down the captive

  it was the jewess who had been left
in charge of elise

chapter xv

what happen ed to elise

 elise dexter did not know how
long she had lain on the uninviting bed
in the jews house when a light hand
laid across her eyes roused her to full
consciousness she sat up to find the
woman standing over her with a can-
dle in her hand and a finger on her lip
to caution the girl against any outcry

  motioning the latter to follow the
woman blew out the light and guiding
elise by the arm ld her out onto the
gallery as they emerged elise heard
a noise below at the street-door some
one was trying to make an entrance-
some one apparently not of the house


the all-story magazine

-for she could hear them rapping in-
sistently and rattling the door

  she was too dazed still too much
under the influence of the jew to care
to inquire who it might be with the
utmost docility she allowed the other
to lead her up into the white silence
of the roofs

  they heard the faint crash as the
door gave in

  then came the sound of hurried feet
in the rooms below and the two women
fled over their own roof to the next
the parapet which separated them was
about four feet high but the jewish
woman scaled it with an agility born
of practise and giving a hand to elise
helped her up they dropped to the
other side and ran across to the next
wall before they could clamber over
they heard some one pursuing

  at the moment when burroughs was
standing erect on the parapet looking
out over the roofs in search of them
the women were crouching in the
shadow of the wall opposite and in
full view of him but their white gar-
ments were blue in that light and min-
gled so nicely with the shadows that
they were perfectly concealed

  they saw the mans tall figure out-
lined against the sky they watched him
breathlessly as he slowly pivoted round
surveying every point within range his
moorish dress and his cowled head
effectively disguised him

  to elise he was merely one of the
race whose hand had been against her
almost from the moment she set - foot
 the continent she shivered in si-
lence while he stood there and drew
a relieved breath when he finally got
down on the side opposite them

  for nearly half an hour they re-
mained in the shadow twice elise es-
sayed a question in english and french
each time she was met by a curt sen-
tence in arabic and in return could
only answer dully

    dont understand je tie com-
prends pas so for the most part they
sat in silence

  at last however the woman stirred
rose to her feet glided across the roof
and pulled herself up so that she could
look over the parapet what she saw
or didnt see was apparently satisfac-

tory for returning she tugged at
elisas arm to indicate that they were
to go back

  they scaled the wall again and
with the woman ahead approached the
stairs leading down into the house
for a while they listened but no sound
came from the depths the jewess
now pushed elise ahead of her and
they cautiously descended just as they
reached the foot of the stairs the si-
lence was broken by voices

  something in the quality of one of
them gave the american girls dulled
senses a jog it seemed familiar till
then under the influence of the jew
this new sound served to bring her back
to her real self her consciousness
pricked up its ears so to speak

  she threw off the restraining hand of
the woman and rushed forward a
light shining behind curtains that sepa-
rated her from the place of voices drew
her toward them with trembling fin-
gers she parted the hangings hoping
that she would see a friendly face she
was disappointed the light in the
room was dim but the picture she saw
instead of reassuring her made her
afraid

  the odious jew was there as its cen-
ter he was lounging on a divan on
the other side of the room his back
toward the watcher a tall moor was
holding a woman in his arms at the
second that elise looked all were silent
but the girl could see the quiet smile
of the jew the speaking eyes and volup-
tuous lips of the woman neither face
gave her confidence or suggested any use
of appeal

  they were enemies

  with a sob of disappointment she
turned away this time she did not go
roof ward ihe accident had wrenched
her loose from the will of the jewish
woman this latter was -behind her
waiting doubtfully and elise saw the
way open to the street without stop-
ping to consider anything except that
possible escape lay in that direction she
made for the stairs

  she realized that the woman was fol-
lowing her that the persons she had seen
in the room were also in pursuit and this
lent wings to her feet she reached the
outer door and plunged through with-
the yellow sard



out being overtaken she heard the
womans cry and a slight scuffle and she
expected that in a moment four or five
people would burst from the door and
be at her heels

  notliing of the sort happened

  looking over her shoulder as she
drew away from the house she could de-
tect no one something had occurred
inside to cut off pursuit she did not
know what and as soon as she was
sure they were not coming she did not
care

  it was enough that she was free from
the evil atmosphere of that house

  but though she was free bodily she
had no real feeling of freedom twice
before that night she had escaped from
the clutches of those who sought to de-
tain her and each time her high hopes
had been dashed to the ground she
was prepared for something to occur to
thwart her now

  in the small hours of the night when
the fires of life burn low her brain was
a fit field for superstitious fancies she
believed that she was under some fatal
infiuencepf the yellow sard it would
have taken more than a course of lec-
tures to have convinced her that some
mysterious force was not working against
her

  thus with something of the attitude
of a fatalist she hurried away from the
house if it was meant that she should
get away doubtless she would if it
was fated that she be retaken she would
not be surprised

  the night though clear was exceed-
ingly raw and her long time crouching
and cramped position  the housetops
had numbed her she had lost her cloak
in the flight and the light gray jacket
gave her little protection

  as soon as she was positive she was
not followed she paused to form some
plan for finding her way out of the
tangle she must attempt to go in some
general direction and trust to luck to
come out at a familiar spot finally
she decided to go down hill for going
up or down was tlie only way she had
of orienting herself

  the streets were not as they were
when she had traveled them with the
jew she no longer met gliding ghost-
ly figures  longer heard occasional

scraps of conversation from doorways
it was as if she were in a city of the
dead

  the houses loomed blue-white like
sepulchers and no man could tell what
they hid narrow arched alleys yawned
at her like the black mouths of cata-
combs

  presently she came out into a small
open square or market - place it re-
sembled the one she had crossed with the
jew but she could not be sure she
was breathless and thirsty however so
she went over to the well-place with the
idea of getting a drink of water there
was no vessel by for obtaining it and
she sank down on the stones to ret for
a moment before continuing her walk

  the loneliness was oppressive and
she began again to think of home

  she had complained sometimes that
life in ohio was dull if she ever got
back there there would be no more com-
plaint she would be willing to take
her adventure in the homeopathic dose
of the picnic or coasting-party what
would her girl chums think if they knew
that she was fleeing alone through the
streets of tangier at dead of night 

  what would her mother reposing
peacefully in a hotel at gibraltar do if
she could see her daughter now what
was mrs ragsdale doing that she had
not already set  foot means for finding
the lost ones

  this thought was brightening sure-
ly mrs ragsdale had done something as
soon as their absence had been remarked
surely men were out now looking for
some trace of her as if in answer to
her thought four figures appeared at the
mouth of a street

  they came without warning and they
were plainly on some errand of haste
for a moment after she discovered them
they were half - way across the square
there were three tall men wearing
fezes the fourth who was a little in
advance was bareheaded they walked
swiftly and noiselessly they carried an
air of authority

  a wind of hope caught the girl in its
grasp

  on the impulse she got to her feet and
ran toward them calling out they
stopped instantly and with stumbling
french she went up to them one of


the all-story magazine

 the men stepped out to meet her holding
 up a lantern he held it up to her face
 and started back with an exclamation of
 wonder

 with a sinking heart elise recognized
 him as one of the same men who had
 taken her from the greasy fritter-shop
 she sought to turn back but he laughed
 gutturally and caught hold of her

 the other faces as they came within
 range of the light were strange one
 the man who was guiding the others
 was a giant negro

 they conferred for a moment

 then the man who knew her took her
 by the arm and they started off again in
 the direction they had been going

chapter xvi

savary llays an ace

 three pairs of eyes were turned curi-
 ously on the woman whom burroughs
 had captured the jews conveyed to
 her a message which the others did not
 catch

 simone spoke in arabic

  your wife she asked

 the jew nodded

  where is the american girl 

 the woman spread her hands

  gone she answered  she has
 gone to find her people she did not
 wish to stay and i did not detain her
 against her will i was protecting her
  how long gone 

 a shrug of the shoulders

  oh quite long

  she went alone 

  yes

 simone explained to burroughs who
 stamped with vexation

  everything seems against us its
 no use wasting time here im going
 after her and to raise an alarm the
 streets are not safe even if she is free
 and  dont half believe this woman

  we will all go said simone  i
 must go back to my house to find
 savary

 the jew addressed her servilely

  you will unbind me and let me go
 since i have proved my innocence
 simone smiled ironically

  i shall take you both with me to con-
 front the man with the wall-eye

   not my wife 

   both do you think i will let you
go now that i have my hands on you  

  burroughs put his hand to his head
weariedly  i think its all lies he
said

   we will soon see if you are going
to search the streets you may as well go
in my direction as another and if you
will wait till i have got the truth from
savary i will help you

  burroughs strode over to the jew and
jerked him to his feet

   now no monkey business he or-
dered  if you try one little small trick
ill break your head we are going to
see whether you are the greatest liar in
morocco or whether savary is the great-
est knave

  at a signal from simone who was
still holding her weapon in readiness the
jewess started also and a little later they
all emerged from the house on the way
through the street the artist was watch-
ful but there was no sign of elise

  before simones door burroughs
stopped

  jean said the frenchwoman help
me in this i am afraid to be alone with
these people it will take only a little
while to find what savary knows and
then-i will help you search

   you cannot search alone and be-
lieve me you would get little assistance
from the pasha they care nothing for
europeans we can do better without
them let me give you a maxim-one
thief can do more toward catching a
thief than six officials

  burroughs realized the truth of what
she said

  you promise to help me find her 

  wes

  so burroughs followed the three into
the house

  when they entered savary in the lock-
fast room knocked heavily upon the door

   here i am he called stentorianly
 here 

  simone glided over and threw it open

   yes we know youre there she said
cuttingly

   ah its you is it  he growled and
then his eyes taking in the rest of the
party he scrutinized each sharply a
puzzled look came into his face

   whom did you expect   asked the
the yellow sard



frenchwoman  did you think you had
tricked us for good

  he grinned

   trick you  i had no hope of trick-
ing you you are too clever he re-
torted sarcastically

   you will laugh on the other side of
your face presently she assured him
 sit down 

    am in your power now but he
laughs best who laughs last-as  have
remarked before

   what do you mean 

   i mean nothing i merely philoso-
phize it is the privilege of the under
dog

  though simone shrugged her shoul-
ders the mans impudence and sang-
froid made burroughs uneasy who was
really going to laugh last in this busi-
ness he asked himself and would he
have an opportunity to laugh at all
simone might laugh or savary but per-
haps he himself was destined to hold
the bag for both

  burroughs was standing near the door
to guard the exit while the jew and
his wife squatted on the floor and
savary who had seated himself noncha-
lantly in one of the great chairs eyed
these two with surprise in his face
with a wave of his maimed hand he in-
dicated them to simone

   and what have our friends here to
do with it he questioned

   he is the man who stole the ring

   ah  savary started and his bad
eye rolled excitedly as he bent toward the
jew

   yes went on simone calmly  it
was he who sold bompards watch and
ring therefore he must have done the
murder or have got them from the man
who did

   ah  said savary again throwing
hinelf back in his chair with an air of
indifference  he looks like a mur-
derer

   i am not sure that i call trust your
judgment you once accused the ameri-
can

   doubtless one is as bad as the other
said savary airily -

   fortunately i dont have to depend
on your instincts i know who did the
murder

  she was standing directly in front of

savary and she spoke this last with an
insinuation of tone that made the wall-
eyed man twist in his chair

   he was near by when the act was
committed and he knows the man she
concluded

  the frenchmans lean body again
swung forward toward the jew and he
glared at him

   you were a fool to be jealous of
bompard she went at him again  you
were a bigger fool to let your jealousy
carry you-so far

  savary let out a flood of oaths that
had they been in english would have
staggered even burroughs but profan-
ity in a foreign language is usually
amusing instead of offensive

  simone ignored his interruption

   he saw you she went on monot-
onously  saw you kill bompard and
then-

   he did not said savary furiously

   easy quieted the woman  you
know you were jealous of bompard

   he got what was coming to him
sulked the frenchman  as for you
he exclaimed scowling at the jew  look
out for yourself 

   i was not there protested the ac-
cused one fearfully  i did not say i
saw you

   but you took the ring and the watch
from me that night

  simone laughed

   then you did do it she charged
 you killed bompard and you took the
ring and the watch and the letters to
make us believe that it was robbery i
know it as well as if i had been there

  a gleam of rage swept across the
frenchmans face as his eyes met hers
he opened his lips to speak but caught
himself

   well pressed the woman  what
have you to say if you are not guilty
where did you get the ring

   bompard gave it to me

   then why did you pretend that it
had been stolen from him why did
you accuse this man -she pointed to
burroughs- with killing bompard be-
cause he had the ring in his possession
if you knew it was stolen from you you
must have known that he did not get it
from bompard

  savary saw that he was trapped and


the all-story magazine

with his antic eye jerking he leered up
at the woman who was pursuing him

  well he shouted what of it
what if i did kill bompard it was a
fair quarrel

  then why did you try to conceal it
why did you not confess that you had
quarreled would we have held that
against you men have fought before
and killed if the cause was fair were
they called to account

   i am not on the witness-stand

   you are in the prisoners dock and
whatever excuse you have for the killing
you have none for trying to keep the let-
ters from us what are you going to
do with them  

  he did not answer and she neared him
by a step and stood over him with a
menace in her strong hands

   i have not got the letters

  with a quick movement she thrust
back the lapel of his jacket and began
feeling in his pockets his eye flashed
resistance and he drew back but the
muzzle of a pistol in his face brought
submission

  she searched him as skilfully as she
had the jew half an hour before bur-
roughs looking on felt a wave of dis-
gust as he watched her fingers plainly-
used to such work saw how nimbly they
moved and with what brazen certitude
she  went through  the man

  suddenly she gave a gurgle of tri-
umph and jumped back waving a thin
packet above her head

   the letters  she crowed holding
them aloft in the hand on which shone
the yellow sard with the seal of the pre-
tender

  burroughs himself felt a lump rise in
his throat it was as though he saw the
beginning of the end

 do you know what i believe
charged the woman of savary  i be-
lieve that you were not only acting from
jealousy but that you have played us
traitor you were going to sell the let-
ters and the ring to the sultan you
needed money and you could get more
from him than by staying with us
there were four of us and you would
have got the reward alone it looked
profitable to play traitor youll find it
didnt pay

  savary somehow had lost his anger and

his nervousness he grinned lazily
 you were always clever at putting two
and two together he retorted

  burroughs interrupted

   we are going  he asked

  simone nodded

   i promised jean and i will go but
do you still wish to go back to your coun-
try we will find the girl and restore
her to her people but is there nothing
worth more to you-the fight the in-
trigue the success  she waved the let-
ters  is it not worth while and have

i	not been able to make you care  

  she flung it out regardless of savarys
presence and the words seemed to fan
his temper to a flame

   what if you have made him care
he shouted  neither of you will live
to enjoy the other you played with
bompard and you sec where he is you
fling this man in my face and an hour
from now you will both be beyond help

   you think you have won because you
have found me out and have the letters
but having them is just what will do for
you do you think i am a fool do you
think that if i needed money bad enough
to kill bompard i am so careless as not
to take the proper steps for getting it

  in his anger he had boiled over and
simone turned and regarded him a mo-
ment in deep silence their eyes battled
and his gave hers glance for glance she
looked behind uneasily

   we had better go she said to bur-
roughs  i do not know what he means
it may be an idle threat and it may
be-

  it may be the soldiers of the sultan
cackled savary as the curtains of the
great double door parted and two men
leaped in

  one liad his hand over simones mouth
before she could scream and had wrested
the pistol from her grasp theother at-
tempted to seize burroughs but the lat-
ter jumped past him toward the door

  then from out of the darkness of the
gallery stepped another man and the
butt of his long gun crashed down on the
americans head the young man wilted
like a tree under a lightning stroke the
moor pushed him aside with his foot and
made way for the negro who came in
leading elise dexter burroughs bad
been facing her as he fell she recog-
the yellow sard

nized him and now she put her hands
to her face to shut out the sight of him
as he lay huddled there on the floor it
was only for a second she started to
kneel by him but the man whom he had
dodged shoved her away and gave a
word to the fellow whose gun had laid
the american low

  obeying the nod of the leader the sol-
dier picked up burroughss body and
dragged it out into the gallery while the
others were busied with the livelier cap-
tives one man forced simone to squat
on the floor another stood over the jew
and his wife who were protesting vol-
ubly that they were innocent of any and
all crimes

  the big negro crossed quickly to
savarys side and whispered in his car

  that worthy turned on the french-
woman with his hard laugh

   who laughs last  lie twitted  do
you see now how it all happened  when
you began to play fast and loose with
me i decided that i could play a game
myself i killed bompard both to get
even with you and to get the letters

   when you helped the american es-
cape from here i sent selim for the sul-
tans men while i came back to have it
out with your new friend your return
delayed matters but it is after all most
fortunate

   we have caught all the more birds
in our little net-even the american
whom i had not expected the honor of
entertaining while he was speaking
he stood erect and stretched his arms
above his head i shall pay you for
this stiffness he snarled at simone

  monsieur said the man who had
acted as leader  your slave came to us
with the word that if we would come
here you would give us important news

  savary nodded and produced the ma-
terials for a cigarette

  	will you not sit down  he said po-
litely  i have indeed important news
you perhaps know- that some french
bankers are- furnishing funds for the
pretender through agents in tangier
you perhaps do not know that one of
these agents is here on the way to him
with important letters and carrying mu-
leys ring as a passport to his presence

   the woman there said the man
pointing to elise  was seen with the

ring but we have not been able to
trace it

   but i was fortunate enough to dis-
cover the plot and to capture the plot-
terssaid savary with oily ease

  simone who was squatting next him
leaned over a little and interjected a low
word in french

   suppose  come back to you she
whispered  it is not too late you can
save us yet  will come back and we
can work together

  his good eye softened as he heard the
word and he paused as if the proposition
had touched him while he was de-
bating the soldier who had dragged out
burroughs slipped in and took his place
by simone

  he sat cross-legged his head bowed
on his breast as if oblivious to what was
going on elise who was on the other
side drew away from him with loathing
she had seen him strike burroughs and
the latters white face as he lay on the
floor had pained her like a knife-stab
she had been puzzled to find him there
in the garb of a moor she also recog-
nized in simone the woman whom she
had seen in the jews house but only
vaguely did she connect the two it was
all a part of the great enigma of the
night it was all arabic as unintelligible
as a sentence of the koran

  what was coming she did not know
but burroughss death meant the remov-
al of her last hope it was natural that
she should turn from the man whose
hands had helped in his undoing

  the moors paid no attention to the
entrance of their comrade as the lat-
ters eye peering out from under his
cowl happened to encounter savarys
the frenchman suddenly stiffened and
leaped from his seat with an oath he
got no farther

  a revolver in somebodys unlifted
hand barked

  savary his wall-eye strangely con-
torted pitched forward against simone
at the same instant another shot extin-
guished the lamp and darkness fell in
the room

  there was a word and a blow between
two other persons there was another
shot and fierce cursing

  elise felt a pair of hands at her arm-
pits she was lifted to her feet and

with a man on either side was rushed
across the room

  she knew that she was treading on the
bodies of prostrate men the curtain
swayed for her exit and as they reached
the court below the man on her left
leaned close to her and burroughss
voice in her ear whispered  elise 

chapter xvii

the end of the game

  when the leader signed the soldier to
remove burroughss body the fellow
grasped him roughly by the collar and
dragged him through the room and out
onto the gallery

  there he loosened his grip and after
a moment for getting his breath he be-
gan to search the young mans pockets
he relieved him of two revolvers a
knife a watch and some gold coins that
were still in his trousers pockets

  laying the loot on the floor he rose
to his feet pulled the body after him
and prepared to tumble it over the rail-
ing into the court below the thing
lopped against him with a muttered
imprecation he seized the limp form
about the middle and was in the act of
bending it backward over the railing
when the dead man suddenly stiffened in
his arms like a flash he realized that
the thing he was handling was not dead
but very much alive

  the realization came too late he was
altogether unprotected so far as a
wrestling defense was concerned as he
started to shout a hand closed on his
throat his heels were tripped up and
he went sprawling over backward with
the tartar he had caught on top of him
they made a little noise as they scuf-
fled but it was drowned by the cn-
fusion that still reigned within-the
laugh of savary a splutter of arabic
from the jew simones protesting

  it was fortunate for burroughs that it
was so and he knew that it would not
last long  what he did must be done
quickly he did something that after-
ward he could not actually regret for
lie believed it had been necessary but he
deplored it his free hand found the
knife that lay near him and he used it

then he slowly got to his feet and felt

of his head when the butt of the moors
guns came down on it he had seen a star-
studded firmament for a second but
his skull was protected by the folds of
the turban and he fell under the im-
petus of the blow rather than because
he was seriously injured

  indeed it had fallen so happily that
it had left him little more than dazed
he was aware of the entrance of other
persons besides the first two and he did
not attempt any resistance

  one of the rules of a football game is
that when your eleven is up in the air
it is good tactics to play possum thus
getting time to recover both your breath
and your balance so partly because
of this instinctive feeling and partly be-
cause his senses were really a bit numbed
he feigned unconsciousness

  when elise was led in he very nearly
gave himself away he wanted to fight
but he hesitated against such odds and
he was still too witless to make up his
mind quickly his hesitation acted as
much in his favor as a carefully con-
ceived plan would have done

  he had another bad moment when the
fellow grabbed him by the collar anck
started to bundle him out burroughs
wanted to object but now wisdom was
creeping in and he knew that the odds
would be too great so he kept quiet

  he also allowed the man to go through
his pockets because that gave him still
more time to get his breath even while
he was being searched he devised the
plan which he put in practise

  the moor was about the americans
build and the latter proceeded to appro-
priate his outer garments his fez his
jacket his long burnoose

  he was soon ready he regained his
weapons-two revolvers and a knife
the latter he stuck in his belt where he
could get at it quickly the former he
took one in each hand cowling the
burnoose over his head and chin he
draped the ends over the pistols

  it was a tense moment when he parted
the curtains walked across the room
and seated himself between the two
women as he adjusted his legs under
him he covered one of simones hands
with a fold of his mantle and under its
protection found her fingers and gave it
a meaning pressure
the yellow sard



  ho felt her tremble at bis touch but
she did not look at him or make any sign
except to lean over and whisper to sa-
vary in an effort to hold his attention
while her fingers were closing on the re-
volver that burroughs slipped to her

  she succeeded in getting the weapon
comfortably in jier palm but not in de-
ceiving savary he detected the trick
and with an oath he jumped for him

  simone fired

  burroughss bullet put the light out
then he wheeled and smashed the moor
who was nearest him in the face

   hurry monsieur he heard simones
voice  i will keep them busy

  there was another shot followed by a
scream from the negro burroughs had
already lifted elise to her feet and
started out but the man who bad her in
charge was equally vigilant and he too
was at her side he did not realize what
had happened and it was plain that in
the darkness he took burroughs for a
comrade who was seeking to save their
prisoner

  they reached the street without be-
ing overtaken there the soldier turned
to wait for his companions speaking to
the american as he did so fortunately
the latter did not have to reply for the
words were not out of the mans mouth
when simone emerged from the door
slamming it in the face of some one
who was two steps behind

  the lock clicked musically-at least
it was music to burroughs who had oc-
casion this time to thank heaven that so
much of the modern had come into mo-
rocco

  the moor at his side however did
not see it in such a light with his baf-
fled comrade inside hammering on the
door and clamoring to get out he spoke
again to the supposed soldier who was
holding elise and asked him to look
after the frenchwoman he spoke in
arabic however and the american gave
no heed

  simone was moving away and the
moor extended an arm to detain her
she whirled  him and a pistol glittered
in her hand the moor backed toward
burroughs whose fist caught him on the
jugular and he tumbled on the flag-
stones

  the frenchwoman laughed

  quick now she called and with
elise between them they ran down the
street leaving the imprisoned soldiers to
make a light count their losses and
finally to get out their mission a failure

  the fugitives made a turn at the first
corner and - then another and another
simone gniding sure that they were
not pursued they stopped

  the thoroughfare in which they stood 
held no life the city was in the dead
hours of the early morning-the hours
just before dawn when men and dogs
and all manner of breathing things are
resting if the night gives them any
rest

  simone broke the silence by one of her
low laughs she put one hand on the
arm of the american girl and swinging
her round so that the light from a street-
lamp fell full on her face surveyed her
earnestly

   mademoiselle she said at last in-
dicating burroughs  he loves you i
hope you are worthy of him he is a
man

  it was not an observation which elise
could have answered even if she had
understood which she didnt

  she gave the other look for look and
then turned questioningly to the artist

  the frenchwoman lifted her shoul-
ders ever so little

   i have won she said  i have the
letters and the ring you have your
lady good-by jean i am not such a
good woman but sometimes i have my
good moments maybe you might have
made me good you are a man

  she extended her large white hand im-
pulsively and burroughss fingers closed
over it

   i hope you understand he said
blunderingly  i hope you understand
that im very much obliged to you that
i-

  simone waved her hand

   good-by-i must hurry  

  with a final quick nod that included
both she vanished in the blue-gray
shadows leaving burroughs and elise
standing in the middle of the deserted
street

  where have you been each asked
the other in the same breath but with-
out waiting for an answer elise proceed-
ed wearily


the all-story magazine

   can we go back to the hotel iets
get away from here its so awful

   well try replied burroughs  but
im not sure i know the way are you
all right

  elise clasped her hands round his arm
and leaned toward him

   yes but it has been a nightmare
she murmured - can we go

  burroughs looked around him above
in the rift between the houses he could
see a fillet of pearl-gray moonlit sky
against it towering over them was the
slender form of a minaret at a little
distance they discerned the doors of a
mosque

  after a shade of hesitation he said
 i dont know where we are but if i
can get up there above the roofs perhaps
i can get our bearings weve got to
risk it its that or wandering round here
all night if you will wait here i will
try

  the quick tightening of her fingers
foretold her answer

   ill go with you she said  i
wouldnt stay here alone for a million
dollars

  you are not too tired to climb

   ill hold out she replied

  the mosque doors were open and
slipping inside on tiptoe burroughs
groped his way toward the corner over
which rose the minaret feeling along
the wall with his hands he found a little
door and inside a spiral stairway

   quiet now he muttered  if
were caught here itll probably mean
more trouble

  she answered by a hand-pressure and
they forthwith began the ascent tread-
ing lightly scarcely daring to breathe
till they reached the platform at the
summit

  the girl gasped in amazement

  above them was the pale-blue tent of
sky the stars had gone out nearly at
the zenifti hung the faded moon like a
half-nibbled cheese to the east a
faint orange flush told of the speedy
coming of the day on one side the
white terraces marched down toward the
sea just below them was the long street
that led from the soko to the landing-
place and their haven

  a little sob rose in the girls throat as
she realized what this meant a few more

minutes and they would be out of the
danger zone the home-path lay in front

  burroughs knew it too but for one
long look he turned his eyes back on the
terraced city of adventure

  safety was near yet for a moment
before he set his foot toward it his
thoughts went back to the strange wom-
an who had touched the circle of his life
for a night he heard the murmur of
her caressing voice he felt the velvet of
her hand against his own her influence
was still present

  but it was a fading vision there at
the top of the minaret while day whi-
tened he was bidding good-by to the mys-
terious east to the pale world of roofs
to the perfume of musk and aloes to men
and women of strange ways

  elise moved and a small sigh escaped
her swiftly he was brought back to
that presence at his side-the western
woman who was of his own kind

  he had a vision of her as he had seen
her on the steamer-deck in clean cool
garments lithe of figure blue-eyed and
smiling fine in speech and action

as he heard the whisper of her sigh
he bent forward and took her in his arms

   we are safe now girl he com-
forted  dont worry well get out all
right

  she yielded to him and against his
breast he felt her nod

   and youre mine he said vehe-
mently  mine no one shall come
between us

   yours

  their warm lips met and her arm
tightened comfortably round his neck

  youre not hurt in any way he
questioned solicitously

 no are you where have you
been and what does it all mean it
seems years-years

   its a long story are you able to
go on now we mustnt waste time

   ready she said

   ive lost the ring he said suddenly

   as if that mattered when i was
afraid i had lost you

  at nine that morning mrs ragsdale
quite pink and pretty and remarkably
young looking for a lady of forty swept
into the hotel dining-room she caught
sight of elise and burroughs sitting at
the storm



a table near a window and pounced
down on them with -a smile that was
warm and superior

   ah she exclaimed  i was afraid
you might be late you know were go-
ing back to gibraltar this morning

   we are sorry began burroughs
but the widow babbled on  i know
youll forgive me for running away from
you last night and leaving you to your
own devices

  both burroughs and elise stared

   you see when we got back from our
walk the turnbulls carried us off to din-
ner with some friends of theirs who have
a villa a little way out we wanted you
but you werent back

   where on earth were you moon-
ing around i suppose did the porter
tell you where we had gone i knew
you wouldnt mind and i knew i was
perfectly safe in leaving you to amuse
yourselves i thought we should have
been back earlier but the night was so
pleasant we stayed longer than we
thought you had retired when we got
back

   after all i dont imagine you were
very much aggrieved at having to spend
the evening together

  she simpered and shrugged and end-
ed with a smile that was intended to be
coy

  burroughs so far forgot himself as to
whistle

   i know youll forgive me said the
widow  when i tell you that mr mc-
intosh and i are about to be married
shortly

  the artist reached over and shook
hands

   my dear lady he said  you
mustnt feel the least compunction the
porter gave us your message when we
got in

  he did not add that he himself had
applied a gold piece to that function-
arys palm when they received the start-
ling news that their absence had been
overlooked the hotel people thinking
that they were with the other party and
their chaperon believing that they were
at the hotel burroughs had also ob-
tained the jews letter demanding ran-
som

   thats nice went on the lady
 i hope you didnt have too dull an
evening

  again the smile

  no agreed burroughs it was not
what you would call dull still were
ready to go back to-day weve some
news for mrs dexter you see elise
and i-were engaged too

   i knew the wise thing was to leave
you said mrs ragsdale

the storm

 by jennie harris oliver

  of real estate and wedding-bells
  and a mixture of spring
  freshets and the course of love

it was a storm quite notable in history
it came out of a blur of angry
evening red with wild sheets of
screaming white rain from the
murky boiling river under it the little
cabin cowered like a beaten hound-even
the three shadows within looming gro-
tesquely backward from the fireplace

shrinking and flaring fitfully as the ed-
dying flame sprang upward and strung
itself like rubies on threads of cobweb
swaying from the blackened rafters

  between crashes of deafening thunder
two of the shadow-s talked doggedly and
persistently

   yes steve said one lifting his
shrewd calculating features in a vain en-
deavor to suck into life his neglected
pipe  yuh ricollict whut i told yuh last
time yuh ast fer retta-may conditions

peenk and gold - slim and straight
strong as a young panter ef she haint
wuth more tuh yuh than the north forty
why yuh dont hev tuh take her-thats
all

  there was a sudden fierce outburst of
the storm as if the very prince of demons
had broken loose and under its clutch-
ing hand the stanch little structure shud-
dered and rattled fearsomely dark
streams of rain crawled in from the
sill-less door and the girl rose silently to
sweep back the flood and block its fur-
ther entrance with an old ragged coat

   taint jest ike fumed the young
man when at last he could make himself
heard  yuh know theres coal and mebbe
gas on that paster-ridge and that im

embers that enveloped them for a breath-
less moment  yur north forty and mine

i tangled up in this deal guess i hold
the whup-hand steve

  the young man dropped his face in
his hands and sat for some time in deep
thought the roaring light sprang rud-
dily over his dark head over the old
mans hard shrewd eyes and the girls
beauty around them roared and wailed
and crashed the tireless fury of the storm
finally stephen martin sprang erect a
brave resolve in his deep-set gray eyes

   ill give her up ike he said huskily
 id ruther she married some one as has
plenty then tuh go out into the world
empty-handed with me heaven knows
id ruther do without her than tuh see her
eyes grow hopeless and her form thin and
bent like her mothers and mine

   stop  cried the girl suddenly with
blazing eyes yuh dont never leave

her excited eyes on his troubled face
the storm



cause ill go inyways - pappy kaint
keep me in this prison no more

  stephen took the girls coaxing hand
and smoothed it gently he thought of
it seamed and darkened and roughened
still her eyes commanded him and he
answered hesitantly

   the north fortys yourn ike and
rettas mine

    retta - may yuhre a fool growled
her father with well-assumed dissatisfac-
tion  yuhll wear rags yit reckon
wed better put this deal in writin right

tree haint no mistakin that way o
puttin hit everythin norths mine-
everythin souths yourn write hit in
steve-write hit in  

  standing almost ankle-deep in water
the young man bent over the rude table
and gravely wrote the document as di-
rected	

  as he handed it to pedigrew the cabin
tilted sickeningly forward there was a
gurgling inrush of the foamy flood and
the fire went out quickly with a strong
smell of wet ashes they were in total
darkness

   retta shouted stephen groping for
her in the blackness  retta  retta 
there was a gasping cry from among
the huddled furniture as the cabin right-
ed itself with a hissing outpour of water
and then sprang sidewise like a chunk of
driftwood in a whirlpool and in a mo-
ment he held the girls dripping sha-
king form tightly with one arm while he
braced his back against the heaving side
of the rough wall and spread a protect-
ing hand over the silk of her hair

  any minute something might drop
upon them-some awful thing reach out
of the hideous melee of sound

   	s

  they could hear the old man blunder-
ing and sputtering furiously among the
shifting debris they could hear the
grinding and tearing of rock and tree-
the continuous swirl and roar of angry
water bearing them jerkily along in the
awful gloom

  occasionally a red flare of lightning
showed them the cabins wild interior
with objects heaped grotesquely against
the fireplace by one such flash the old
man made his way over to stephen and
retta

   devils own night this  he shout-
ed angrily  ben hyar nigh on to
twenty year and never did see no sich
goins on before ill bet were in the
river right now goin south like thun-
der

  so he punctuated the awful uncertain-
ty and reiterated raspingly as the night
wore on

  finally after what seemed an eternity
of tipping and whirling none could
guess whither they felt the cabin settle
firmly and remain at anchor the storm
rested and through the broken shutters
filtered the grateful light of the coming
dawn

  righting the obstructing furniture
they made their way through the slimy
mud to the door pulling it wide on its
sagging hinges they looked out on a
scene that drew a sharp cry of wonder
from the young couple and a yell of
consternation from the thwarted old
schemer

  they were south of big rock and
sentinel gum tree on a firm root-
bound clump that had washed safely out
into the stream and worked its way to a
quiet inlet in the water side of the south
forty

  the two valuable pastures were no-
where to be seen undermined and
crumbled by the wearing flood of cen-
turies they had melted and spread use-
lessly under the furious yellow stream
and over their coal and gas the water
rushed and foamed and swirled while
freed from its pent - up film - covered
pools stephen martins southland lay
green and smiling on the ridges-richly
muckily black where the deeps caught the
rosy morning light

  amazed by the miracle wrought over-
night by the storm and the freakish

the hidden hate

by howard fitzalan

the body of a murdered man calls aloud for vengeance yet
culprit and executioner are closer than brothers

a n o v e l-c omplete in this issue

chapter i

the swamp treasure

i f argued hugh coates as he took
 notice from time to time of the
 dingy house with the dying virginia
creeper  if he or she wants a
man who places no value upon a human
life it might be better for an applicant
to go armed and prove the truth of his
statement by pumping lead into the reck-
less advertiser

  seen through the gloom of lower
washington square the house of the man
who had need of a homicide presented
few attractions

  it was old but the architecture was
commonplace its windows needed wash-
ing and one of the newel - posts was
broken giving the place the aspect of a
wicked wag with his head on one side

  hugh had been standing on the oppo-
site side of the street for several minutes
now and his liking for the house was
decreasing with every added second he
stayed there

  now he observed that it was an object
of indecision with another besides him-
self  and the fact that he shared with
the place the scrutiny of the man of the
silken scarf came near to sending him
away with an unanswered advertisement
in his pocket

  he had left this one until the last be-
cause he was in no way particular about
answering it at all for it sounded very

much as though it were the slogan of a
mafia society

   wanted-a man who places no value
  upon a human life k s  orton
  street city

  pie had taken out the slip of paper
and was completing the hundredth read-
ing when a cough at his side gave hugh
to understand that the man with the silk-
en scarf had decided that his personality
was more interesting that the house

  the scarf was of knitted gray silk and
the man wore it under his overcoat as
most men wear stock-collars pinning it
half-way down with a cameo pin other-
wise he was most unremarkable in attire
and appearance except that one would
judge his eyes to be brighter than most

   are you going to answer that adver-
tisement   he asked directly

   are you anxious to get into trou-
ble was hughs uncivil rejoinder
 if you are a fine way to do it is to mix
up in somebody elses business

   im not very diplomatic sighed the
other turning away  one man to do
the work and one man to talk-they dont
go together pardon me friend

  hugh softened

  if itll do you any good to know ill
tell you of course

   well to a certain extent it seems
imperative replied the man with the
scarf twisting the cameo round  con-
suming curiosity is my curse i want to
the hidden hate



know why that fellow advertised for a
man who put no value on human life
not an ordinary advertisement youll
grant that my theory is that he is
crazy-

  he questioned hugh

   his name is selfridge an old fellow
whose wife just died hes got a son at
college and a stepdaughter whos been
acting as servant-girl its a rooming-
house he boarded there with madam
ruiz when she ran it

   used to be a line old fellow then
they say and the madam and her daugh-
ter and he and his son all went over to
the fourteenth street theater every-v
saturday night and had supper in lii-
chows then he married her and all
of a sudden they change they dismiss
the servants and madam and her daugh-
ter do all the cooking and house-clean-
ing while the old man tends furnace
after he gets home from his work in the
custom-house-has a soft snap there at
eighteen hundred dollars a year

   thats been nearly two years ago
now stunning girl even if she does
make beds and wash the dishes and scrub
the floors and then i forgot about
that too-she takes french and spanish
lessons and goes to one of the best dan-
cing-schools in new york

  and the sons at college ques-
tioned hugh

   second year lies home now i
guess the old lady-madam ruiz that
was-she died three or four days ago
and he came home for the funeral now
the old guy puts in this ad about wanted
a man who cares nothing for a human
life and its got me dotty trying to
guess

   why dont you ask him then was
hughs sensible query

  the man with the scarf did not answer
this question but his eyes seemed to grow
brighter as he planned an evasion it
came in the form of a statement that the
old man was apt to recognize him al-
though it hardly seemed to hugh that the
gentleman was telling the truth

   how did you find out so much about
these people hugh further inquired

   its a curse-my curiosity bewailed
the man with the scarf  ill go to no
end of pains to gratify it itll cost me
my life yet but say be a good fellow

and apply for the job liell probably
give it to you-

  he weighed hugh up

   a nice strong-looking fellow like
you with a fine free air of not caring
for anything-you look like you dont
give a hang for human life tell him
you dont anyhow just to find out what
its all about ill wait for you out here
on the pavement and say if the old
mans gone nutty heres a cannon you
can tote along to make a grand-stand
play with

  hugh felt the left pocket of his coat
sag under the weight of the heavy bit of
hardware that was dropped into it if
the man was pretending this curiosity to
get him to go into the house it was curi-
ous that he should arm him with a six-
shooter

  as his hand closed on the butt of it
hugh made up his mind and nodding
curtly to his new acquaintance stepped
across to  orton street and rang the
bell

  the haze was heavy and the lights
glistened from washington square like
phosphorescent jellyfish in a sea of moon
mist orton street was quiet under the
shroud

  the man on the other side of the
street had become invisible only a gray
blur indicating that there was another
side at all if people were traversing
the thoroughfare they were gentlemen
of predatory disposition in tennis-shoes
or else the fog was wrapped like cotton
about their boot-soles

  under such circumstances the mere
opening of a door startled hugh into
gripping the weapon in his pocket

  the hall was dark for the flickering
gas was almost hidden by the four sides
of a semiopaque flemish lantern that
swung overhead

   now now warned the voice of
some one who stood behind the door ex-
posing but enough of his head to give
sight of the one without  you might as
well not come in and worry us we
dont know anything about your mail-
and weve closed your room this is a
private house-a private house-and it
is also a house of grief f should think
you would have some shame

  the tone had become high and queru-
lous and hugh accustomed to the haze


the all-story magazine

now made out a segment of rough bristly
hair and beard between which an eye
opened and shut rapidly

   i called in answer to an advertise-
ment said hugh emboldened by the
age and complaining tones of the man
 its true it appeared yesterday he
added extenuatingly  and youve prob-
ably got the man you wanted by to-day
but i saw it only this morning

    yes shrilled the old fellow in a pas-
sion  and i suppose youre going to
ask me who i want you to kill  dare
say youll tell me youve killed men be-
fore-

   to tell you the truth replied hugh
frankly  thats the very reason ive been
hesitating for five or six minutes across
the street i was afraid that was just
what you wanted and im willing to
adopt any profession but murder are
you  k s  

  he thought it better to make no show
of the information gathered from the
man across the street

  the old man did not answer his ques-
tion but fumbled about in the dark hall
returning with a lighted match cupped
between his palms and held in such a
way that the escaping ray fell aslant
hughs cheek-bones

   come in he said abruptly as the
door slammed at hughs heels

  another door thrown open ahead re-
vealed a room and a tiny fire by which
sat a girl her head resting on her palms
the red glow upon her dusky hair a sil-
houette of her head in shadow like that
of a young arcadian shepherd un-
moved by the entrance of a stranger she
swung a foot and ankle whose slimness
was not disguised by the coarseness of
stocking and shoe with the regularity of
a pendulum her eyes fastened upon the
fire

  across the room an oil-lamp burned
on a table that was scattered with coarse
paper filled with figures and sketches
over which the old man threw a copy of
an evening journal before he motioned
his visitor to a chair

   as for the girl he paid as little atten-
tion to her as she had given to their en-
trance

   draw up he said and hugh saw
across the lamp - lit table a man with
bristly iron-gray hair cut close to his

scalp a beard - pure white - clipped
watery eyes and a pair of ears phenome-
nally small certainly not one to fear
his attire denoted cleanly poverty-an
old office - coat frayed cuffs a white
string tie

   i worded that advertisement wrong
he commented as he gazed at hugh
 you are the first man who applied that
i could take the rest were rascals
you-youre well-dressed and you look
honest you havent come here out of
curiosity-to mock me

    i came here with my pal phil bemis
from nevada three weeks ago answered
hugh  we were a couple of the un-
lucky ones sunk everything we had and
got nothing weve run short of every-
thing but clothes and linen-we bought
a lot of that when we were flush in san
francisco

   were mining engineers by profes-
sion and did well up to this year then
we thought we had a good thing round
goldfield-and we were the good things
want any references  

   yes replied the old man  my
names selfridge yrou can find out all
about me from my bankers-ellison 
head

  hugh gave him his visiting-card and
several letters over which old selfridge
studied holding the letters up to the
light as though to detect blotches or
erasures silently he handed them back

    i suppose he said  youre curious
about what i mean by that advertise-
ment 

   eh-yes rejoined hugh whose
eyes had wandered to the silhouette of the
little head made by the dancing firelight

  since his first glance at her it had
seemed unnecessary for the old man to go
into any details about the work he wished
done  it was already settled in the mind
of hugh coates that it was he and he
alone who could do what was required

    i mean said old selfridge sternly
 your own life- do you value it 

  the pendulum movement of foot and
ankle became slower then still and
hugh was divided between dislike of
untruth and fear of being adjudged a
coward before the girl had even looked
at him

  why i dont know sir lie replied
a trifle uneasily  i dont know that
ihe hidden hate



ive ever given the subject very much
thought ive got no great quarrel with
life-but the devils had me in his hand
once or twice and i dont believe 
showed the white feather i dont guess
any healthy man is anxious to die-but
i reckon im as courageous as the aver-
age

  he was glad to note that the foot and
ankle remained still evidently he had
acquitted himself well enough to be
judged worthy of a listeners attention

  he had not been paying very close at-
tention to the old man but it was plain
that he had been accepted as one worthy
of trust for when his mind recalled the
presence of selfridge it was to discover
that part of a narrative had escaped him

   one of the oldest families of the
south but fallen upon evil times so my
father came north just after the civil
war and i never saw any of my rela-
tives after that except uncle benjamin
who left me his library when he died-
very old books that came from selfridge
hall in powhatan county maryland

  the girl turned and met the gaze of
the young engineer and again the drift
of the old mans speech was lost in
hughs contemplation of her pallid face
her tragic eyes expressionless when she
saw he observed her

  what eyes she seemed too little to
have them too slender too young
coukl this be the girl who made the beds
and washed the dishes it was like
using one of rodins sculptures to grow
spring onions in had it coarsened her
hands

   mr coates 

   yes sir i heard what you said

  and putting his head between his
hands hugh coates leaned his elbows on
the table and heard the old man drone
on for close upon an hour

   i accept sir he said instantly
when a long silence seemed to indicate
that the story was completed

   you understand said selfridge
carefully  that you are to be paid ex-
actly one-twenty-fifth of whatever treas-
ure is found and nothing at all until it is
found another one-twenty-fifth must
go to another man whom  have yet to
find

   the remainder goes to my son hor-
ace selfridge whom my stepdaughter

donna is to marry as soon as he has com-
pleted his course at college meanwhile
she will go with us to powhatan county
and cook for us and keep camp-that is
donna over there

  he nodded toward the girl by the fire
who look no more interest in the state-
ment than though it concerned some un-
known person crossing to the mantel
old selfridge took down a cabinet pic-
ture which he laid before hugh

   and that is horace  

  if his tone had been casual in refer-
ring to the girl it made up for it in
the statement having to do with the
original of the flabby young man in the
flamboyant college clothes as weak-eyed
and squirrel-eared as his father yet not
without a certain sort of good looks

   you mentioned a friend said self-
ridge as he replaced the photograph

   my pal returned hugh eagerly
 weve been together since our freshman
year itll be hard parting with him
i-i-wonder if you couldnt find a
place for him i-id hate to leave
phil

   i need another man if hes willing
to go on the same terms-

  willing shouted hugh grasping
the old mans hand willing youre
on the two of us report for duty to-
morrow morning  sav youve saved our
lives

  so overjoyed was he that he with
difficulty restrained his terpsichorean de-
sires he concluded the arrangements
hastily for he felt that nothing short
of an air-ship would take him speedily
enough to phil bemis

  as he crossed the room he paused
and regarded the girl but she still rocked

  when he went out she was still rock-
ing and he did not see her eyes again

chapter ii

damon and pythias

  it was still misty without but the
noise of the closing door was enough to
attract the attention of the watcher
across the street and he whistled softly
hugh crossed over

   im afraid i cant be explicit he
said shortly as he returned the revolver
 but i assure you that it isnt any case


the all-story magazine

of murder its a question of a risky
undertaking that the old gentlemans
going to engage in and he needs a man
to help him thats all really it is
the advertisement meant nothing hut a
disregard for ones own life

  he heard the man breathe relievedly
 and now if its not too much
trouble added hugh as they moved
toward eighth street  would you mind
gratifying my curiosity why did you
want to know and why didnt you ask
yourself 

  the man had dropped his somewhat
careful tone when he answered

   im a special detective thats all my
friend and i went to answer the ad my-
self i took a long chance and pretend-
ed to be a cutthroat and he threw me
out  thought hed recognized me for a
bull im glad its no black hand
stuff but we people have got to look
out for that im obliged to you

  and with a curt  good night the de-
tective cut off in the direction of sixth
avenue passing out of this narrative

  hugh boarded a car and on reaching
his destination-a dingy twenty-third
street hotel-found a scribbled note be-
low the dressing-table light

  sallying out again in response to it
he joined mr philip bemis over corned-
beef hash and poached eggs in a restau-
rant which was at that hour a private
dining-room for the two

   you neednt look at me said phil
sopping up the last of the allotted por-
tion of bread  the ads were principal-
ly designed for those who love work for
its own sweet sake

   qne man offered me as high as seven-
fifty for merely keeping his books doing
his typewriting and running his errands
he said a girl would do it for six but
he wasnt mean- what youve got
something 

   put that between us and it makes a
sandwich answered hugh gleefully as
he laid down the clipping which implied
sanguinary deeds

 what-that crazy one you an-
swered it 

    and done well  replied mr
coates  theres a job for both want
to hear about it  

  nope replied mr bemis im
with you hughey- my dear

  he called the leisurely waitress

   we have got a job he said  you
can duplicate that order little lady
that goes for me and my friend no
old pal i havent the slightest desire to
hear the details all i insist on is rub-
ber gloves  hate to get my hands all
covered with gore its so sticky

   oh thats all a pipe-dream the
old mans a little dotty i think but
hes willing to pay our expenses and
theres a girl-

   i love your lucidity commented
phil

   he comes of a good southern fam-
ily- began hugh

   there are interrupted phil  no
families in the south that are not good
nor that did not once own slaves

   and his cousin still owns a place
down in powhatan county maryland
called selfridge hall he also owns a
few thousand acres of salt - marshes
swamps and creeks bordering on the
atlantic ocean

   following the trail of one of these
inlets to one of these swamps you come
to a small islet on this is buried the
treasure of a certain piratical privateers-
man who departed this life in  he
was the great-great-uncle of the gentle-
man who employs us

   it appears that lie returned from his
piratical career in bad shape and applied
to his brother to take him his brother
thinking he was poor did so grudgingly
to repay him for such a lack of fraternal
feeling the dying pirate ripped open the
binding of a book and secreted therein
the map showing where he had hidden his
ill-gotten gains together with a state-
ment as to why he did it he then neatly
sewed up the binding again

   the volume in question remained in
selfridge hall until after the civil war
when our mr selfridges grandfather
died willing selfridge hall to his eldest
son who cordially hated his brother ben-
jamin and his brother william-our mr
self ridges father

   so both of them had to go to work
and they came north that their aristo-
cratic relatives and friends might not be-
hold their degradation uncle benjy it
appears froze on to some of the books
among them the one doctored by the dy-
ing pirate
the hidden hate



    when he died our mr selfridge got
it a year or so ago he accidentally tore
the binding-and since that time lies
been trying to save enough money to go
down there and get the treasure out of
soak with it he intends to buy self-
ridge hall marry his turnip-faced son
to a darling of a girl and start one of
the really-truly first families of america
on its aristocratic way again

   where do we come in  asked phil
 and why all this bunk about the value
of a human life 

    oh lies superstitious you see the
dying pirate to whom i have constantly
referred in my narrative a sort of a
red ralph the rover evidently thought
that to give such a treasure to some per-
son unknown without having had any fun
out of it himself was poor business since
he had gone to all the trouble of stealing
it he made up his mind hed frame up a
little diversion for his life in another
sphere

    so in the narrative he cautioned the
finder of the treasure to avoid laying his
hands on a certain ruby necklace which
was cursed by the first man whose
life he took and which had already been
responsible for the death of seven men

      myself he writes  scorning the
wisdom of the ancients put my godless
hand upon this netklace and the same
day received the wound which has been
my death he who touches it will sure-
ly die so i caution you to go warily and
avoid even the graze of this malignant
jewel 

    and so hes going to let us dig is
he

    thats about it i suppose does it
feeze you 

	 not if ive got my rabbits foot with
me when do we start 

   to-morrow or the next day were
to help him choose a big touring-car and
to motor down to powhatan county as
it isnt important enough for a railroad
to go within a hundred miles of it
were to make camp at the mouth of
goose inlet while he locates the treas-
ure which is up-creek

    hell have to work by night because
the treasures  his uncles property and
if the uncle catches him at it the treasure
will be  hisn self ridge doesnt trust
anybody a whole lot were to bring the

treasure down-creek a canoe-load at a
time and load it into the motor - car
when we get a motor-load hell take it
and one of us up to the philadelphia
mint leaving the other to guard the
treasure and the girl as his personal rep-
resentative to see we dont double-cross
him

   he figures on three hundred and fifty
thousand dollars without counting the
cursed ruby necklace ive got a hunch
hell let us have the necklace in addition
to the two twenty-fifths so if the map
isnt the bunk weve hitched onto a good
thing

  they clasped hands across the table

   what a good fellow you are hugh
getting me in on everything said phil
as they looked at each other

  arent we pals demanded hugh
in surprise

   you bet we are returned the more
demonstrative phil  and if our fi-
nances are low they are not too low to
drink to the best thing on earth-a
friendship between two men by cesar
its something that lasts that is

  yet hugh found himself thinking of
the girl at the fireside with the head of
an arcadian shepherd-boy and the eyes
of tragedy

chapter iii

                                          v

where the gray geese fly

  it was a sunless afternoon when
nothing seemed alive not even the sea
under a sky like dull platinum lay the
vast stretch of gray marshland and
ocean

  no wind stirred the gorse and the
thistles a single sailing-ship far out
from land lay helplessly to port as though
congealed within an iceberg to the
south the serpentine flow of goose in-
let became glass-like as it lost itself in
the cypress swamp a black blotch upon
the gray and an occasional thin streak
of smoke ascending from the sheltered
cove alone gave evidence of habitation
human or otherwise

  to the two young men who came out
of the little enclosed horseshoe of rock
to stroll on the beach the vastness the
loneliness the silence were only as old
f riends


the all-story magazine

  they had seen many such places un-
der the sky and they liked them better
than the limitations of the cities for
the sea has its own language for those
who love her the broad dome of the
sky tells many secrets to him who un-
derstands and the smell of the strong
fresh air has its own tang which only
its friends may know

  these hardened bronzed and rough-
ly dressed young fellows were the
friends of the elements and the lords
of the silent places it was given to
them to know nature as others know
men and women and they liked nature
better she was kindlier honester giv-
ing warning of her moods

  marvelously ignorant these two of
those creatures which civilization has
made of the noble animal-man their
friendship for one another had been all-
sufficient and they had found no neces-
sity for other ties so strong in the
belief that all other men were like
themselves they had the innocent con-
fiding faith of children in the goodness
of the world

  now stretched out in the gorse with
the salt air upon their faces they filled
their pipes from a single pouch and
stretched out in that glorious laziness
which comes from a knowledge that no
duty is suffering from neglect

   wonder when we begin to earn our
money asked hugh after his eyes
had grown tired of watching the gyra-
tions of a pair of wild geese flying
swampward

   wish hed take us in there with
him grumbled phil pointing toward
the white bark of the birches that
girdled the swampland and where the
arriving geese seemed to have stirred up
some commotion for now out of the
light fog that hung over the cypress-
tops a flock of gray-black forms rose
like an erratic balloon in a vortex
honking shrilling excited

  phil found their appearance further
cause for grumbling

   think what we could do with a
double-barreled shotgun and a dog he
said his tone vexed

  hugh looked at him in some surprise
in the three days they had already
spent at goose inlet a certain an-
tagonism had developed in philip

bemis that hugh had never before
seen even in the most trying experiences
they had shared together

  there did not seem much excuse for
it and hugh was grieved at the lack
of appreciation it showed for were
they not employed  - wasnt there a
chance for making quite a considerable
sum meanwhile wasnt there the
camp-fire the warm blankets the un-
tainted air the rolling sea-and donna

  a sudden suspicion the first he had
had smote hugh was phil daring to
do what he had denied himself self-
ridge had made it plain that donna
was to be his sons wife and until he
no longer owed selfridge service hugh
was determined to keep faith with him

  it was difficult too with that silent
frail little girl moving about uncom-
plainingly an unpaid servant expected
by her stepfather to perform the hard-
est tasks speedily grumbled and sworn
at when she was doing her best and
ignored when menial services were not
required in his heart hugh had
grown to hate old selfridge his greed
his unholy pride and his contempt for
others but he had addressed no words
to donna which held sympathy pre-
ferring to show his feelings by taking
off her hands all the harder labor of
the camp

  until now the fact that phil was
eager to forestall him in this he had
laid down to the natural love which
phil had for him but now he remem-
bered that phil had been actually ill-
natured when hugh had managed to
wake before him this morning and fin-
ish the chopping of the wood before
donna was more than half awake and
as a reward had had her all to him-
self swimming far out to sea with her
ejculting in the chill of the morning

  what a picture -he had made bend-
ing over the fire wrapped to the chin
in a heavy woolen robe crimson of hue
her drying hair loose about her shoul-
ders her great eyes for the moment de-
nuded of tragedy and smiling gratitude
at hugh and such had been the pic-
ture when phil awakened

  he had been ill-natured ever since

   see here bemis said hugh sud-
denly knocking the ashes from his pipe
to the moss and grinding them out with
the hidden hate



his heel  whats the matter with you
these days  

  the use of his surname acted upon
phil as a douche of cold water hugh
had not so addressed him in years
after the shock of it a sullenness re-
sulted

   i dunno what you mean coates
he replied emphasizing the unfamiliar
form of address  what do you
mean  

  there was an absence of honesty in
the glances that were exchanged and
both felt it hugh was the stronger of
the two herefore the first to relent

   oh come pal he said kindly
 theres been a cloud between us lately
-look there  

  with the waning afternoon the fog
over the cypresses and white birches
grew heavier now the sea-mist was
rolling in great patches toward the
trembling reeds and the quaking mud
and soon the white of the birches could
no longer be seen

    we dont want it lo get like that
remarked hugh at length  its just
a little cloud yet old boy

    i tell you  dont know what youre
talking about returned phil stubborn-
ly  youre always getting ideas into
your head like that why cant you
leave me alone  

   he looked away snarling almost for
hughs glance was both hurt and re-
proachful and his phil was
charged with an emotion that the re-
cipient resented for lie knew himself to
be in the wrong vaguely however he
felt that he had been ill-treated here
he was lying  out here under the sky
smoking and doing nothing to anybody
and huh had to deliver him a lec-
ture 

   if its about donna phil- said
hugh tentatively after a long pause

  if whats about donna shouted
the other tearing his soft hat from his
blond head and jumping up excitedly
 if whats about donna good lord
hugh cut it out you make me tired
youll be telling me im crazy about
her next yes and-

    and - arent you   interrogated
hugh hopefully

   no im not returned phil with
an oath and started away hut there

was something so forlorn about hughs
position as he stood staring after that
the heart of his friend melted and back
he came with his hat on again and both
hands outstretched

    dont lets quarrel hugh he said
his tone slightly quavering  after
all weve only got one another but-
well ive been out of sorts-something
-a touch of liver maybe ob the
deuce forgive me old fellow

   and again they filled pipes out of
the same pouch and smoked in silence
but the question hugh had asked about
donna remained still a question and
both men knew it

  phil would have liked to know
whether hugh cared for the girl his
standard of honor was not quite as high
as his dark-haired friends he was
gayer of nature and more easily de-
pressed the fact that selfridges son
was donnas affianced was of no mo-
ment to him

   but hughs attitude-that was dif-
ferent it had hurt him sorely to see
hugh looking forlorn no matter how
much he cared for a girl- no matter
how much he repeated firmly to him-
self-he would not hurt hugh

   from which it will be seen that mas-
-ter phil was slightly prone to the dra-
matic whereas hugh had not one
theatrical impulse he saw no gran-
deur in any action which was a mere
matter of fair dealing with a friend no
beauty in a sacrifice made for one he
loved

   he went to the theater seldom be-
cause he was never in tune with the high
lights of emotions to him there was
never a question of swerving from what
he thought to be the right thing to do
he saw no need to get emotional over
doing the right thing

   but phil would be sure to make an
impressive spectacle out of a sacrifice

   yet phil was the more lovable of the
two where ninety-nine out of a hundred
people were concerned he was light-
hearted while hugh was inclined to be
contemplative he would loan a dollar
to the most casual acquaintance and
neglect to pay back his best friend
phils friends always suffered finan-
cially for their friendship hugh most
of ail


the all-story magazine

             r

  hugh would have denied his friend
his sweetheart or his mother nothing-
but the casual borrower would have
gone away with empty pockets for
where hughs emotions were not
touched he was colder than the heart
of a hotelkeeper

  and now as he stared away at the
long breakers that rose fleece-like and
foamy on the teeth of the inlying rocks
a feeling of desolation overcame him
he was sure tiiat the little dark girl
with the hair like silk and the eyes of
tragedy was necessary to his happiness
yet between him and her lay as many
rocks as separated the breakers from
the beach

  so absorbed was he that he did not
see her coming as for phil he lay
with his face to the moss staring at
the fog on the swamp

  she came toward the silent ones her
hair heavy with the sea-mist little salt-
jewels upon her long lashes framing the
eyes of tragedy came along in her little
rough shoes and coarse stockings but
with the grace of the wind itself in her
swaying walk and sat down silent as
ever beside hugh staring also at the
sea

  phils head had sunk down to the
moss and he slept the breeze riffling
his blond hair the girl put a rough
little hand forward like a tame animal
not sure that it pleases its master and
the rough little hand played with the
blond hair

  it was an instinctive action holding
neither love nor affection in it simply
a desire to make a toy of a living thing
but the scowl upon hughs face caused
her to withdraw the hand quickly and
look away

  she was rather pleased that hugh
should scowl she was only seventeen
and the knowledge that her actions
could influence the thoughts of strong
men thrilled her strangely she wished
suddenly that phil would awake and see
her caress hughs hair would he be
angry too

  she did not make any excuse to hugh
-merely lifted a pathetic little face

  the girls charm was accentuated by
her peculiar quality of silence down
in hei elf-like brain she dreamed
strange things-things big wonderful

soul-stirring and some strength of in-
tuition told her that the words that came
to her lips expressed none of these
things

  she was a witch in her way with a
spell of atmosphere a spell seldom bro-
ken by chatter her eyes spoke for her

  to hugh she always turned the face
of one who needs protection this very
morning out in the water she had pre-
tended once or twice to be out of
breath when in reality her sturdy little
lungs were like those of a seal but
hugh had liked to swim with one arm
about her and she had given him the
chance

  hugh was bigger than phil and she
liked that bigness but then phil told
her funny stories and made a capital
stock of fun out of her stepfather and
also made her heart glad with imita-
tions of the face in the cabinet-photo-
graph which old selfridge intended to
le that of the father of the future self-
ridges

  she had confessed something to phil
this morning it occurred to her to find
out how hugh would take it

   i dont want to marry horace
she said suddenly and just as simply as
the words stand written except for a
certain plaintive note that always ac-
companied the face she turned to hugh

   i wouldnt tell anybody but you
she added hastily with a glance at phil
sleeping  dont say anything to him

  it would be unjust to donna to say
that she did such things as this from
any motive save that of a desire to
please the person to whom she talked
and to prop up her growing belief in
her own importance in these latter
days there had been no one in the house
save old men and women who took
little notice of her save to disparage the
ripe tints of her skin and the  bold-
ness  of her eyes

  donna was a beauty of a warmer
clime the blood of spain was in her
veins spanish blood that had kept pure
for three generations under the hot cen-
tral american sun she was the daugh-
ter of an attache of the salvador con-
sulate by his marriage to margaret
hoskin a patient ox-eyed self-denying
woman who had once nursed senor ruiz
during a serious illness
the hidden hate



  donnas life during her fathers time
had been enlivened by gay well-dressed
gentlemen who often took her for
walks on fifth avenue and let her stop
in raquins with them and drink gren-
adine and other sirups while they
chatted over affairs under the tropic
sky

  hernano ruiz had been a  spender
like all his race and with his death
donna fell from the glory of rainbow-
tinted waistcoated gentlemen until
after madam ruizs marrbge to self-
ridge she degenerated into a lodging-
house  slavey

  she was typically feudal in her im-
pressions men had always had the
right to place women where they wished
-according to her mother but a
realization of her own beauty was
growing stronger every day and it gave
her little warm thrills of pride to think
that such as she was she was able to
influence just such men as she remem-
bered in her days of strolling on fifth
avenue

  she had often thought that it was
very nice to own a gentleman with a
brave waistcoat and an easy way of tell-
ing other people to bring him and his
friends things to eat and drink and not
looking at the money that was given
him in change

   maybe said hugh with a brave
effort  maybe youre too young to
know just exactly whom you do want to
marry

   oh i know she returned with a
little wise shake of the head and an
upward glance that set wild thoughts at
liberty in his well-ordered brain  i
know

  she got remarkable effects with the
few words she used but she was a
plagiarist she had used exactly the
same words and the same glance and
the same gesture with phil in the morn-
ing now she was disappointed in the
effect

  phil had come closer to her and taken
her hand and besought her to tell him
just who it was that she knew to be the
desired director of her destinies hugh
did no such things he only seemed
vaguely troubled also he looked
away from her

  she sighed

   oh donna cried hugh suddenly
and turned eyes on her that even a tyro
like herself knew for yearning eyes

  primitive herself she could not un-
derstand the motives that held him
back in reality she was not quite sure
what she wanted him to do or how it
would affect her if he declared himself
as the man she wanted

  phil was nice too what she chiefly
wanted was sympathy in her affliction
the affliction of being turned over to a
youth who was insufferably masterful
without reason for being so even
donnas youth permitted her to under-
stand that selfridges worship of young
horace was founded on a fallacy

  it was most irksome to her to think
that she should do rough housework in
order that this unprepossessing hobblede-
hoy might live like a gentleman at
college

  donna only knew one kind of gen-
tleman-those of the rainbow-tinted
waistcoats and the easy way of spending
money and to this class young self-
ridge did not belong

   you see donna hugh finally
brought himself to say  any man who
married you and made you throw over
selfridges son would be working a
hardship on you unless you were sev-
eral years older and knew that your love
for him outweighed all other considera-
tions from what your stepfather tells
me the fortune thats buried round here
amounts to something like three or four
hundred thousand dollars

   now that will buy a beautiful
house and provide you with servants
and a maid to take care of your hair
and manicure your fingers and a motor-
car to ride in and a thousand and one
more things that all pretty girls think
are their due you would have to love
a man a great deal to give up all those
things willingly

   dont you see if you married any-
body else youd be bound to poverty
practically all your life that is if-
well in the case of an average man like
hugh coates or phil bemis thats
what i mean

  donna opened her round eyes very
wide	

   but i should have the half of die
treasure she said slowly


the all-story magazine

  hugh smiled

   thats not the way i understand it
donna he returned  you see mr
selfridge is very proud of the position
his family once held in these parts his
idea in digging up this treasure as i
understand it is not so much for him-
self as for the sake of the family name
he wants to put it on the basis it was
before the civil war

   up there -and he waved his hand
to indicate a space far beyond the
swamp- up there lies selfridge hall
that is now in ruins or something very
much like that mr selfridge intends
to-

   i know that said the girl impa-
tiently   but the treasure is to be di-
vided between horace and me it was
to have been divided between mama and
mr selfridge

  hugh shrugged his shoulders

   you evidently dont take your
fathers consuming passion very se-
riously he returned but ill tell you
this youd better not let him hear you
say you dont intend to marry horace
because if you do hell probably send
you out in the world to make your own
living

  in spite of the serious thoughts that
this brought to the girls mind she
could not overlook the chance for co-
quetting

  and what should i do then she
asked 

   why-

  the words were at hughs lips his
arms were curved forward as though to
take her slim body between them when
phil woke and raising himself  his
elbow saw the look and the gesture
there was a scowl  his face

  the girl looked from one to the other
and then away for delight had come
into her eyes-the natural pride of the
woman over whom two men are about to
quarrel

  but a long snarling cry interrupted
the situation and donna sprang to her
feet

   hes awake she cried  ill have
to run and cook some supper

  the two men followed slowly neither
speaking

  finally phil knocking the ashes
from his pipe with a quick gesture

sprang ahead and left his companion
alone in the silence of monotonous
sounds

chapter iv

the red necklace

  there is no particular virtue in keep-
ing onea body clean if one inhabits a
room with a bath attached the truly
cleanly man or woman must be sought for
in places where the taking of a bath is
accompanied by painful preparation
old selfridge could not be so classified
since the arrival of the party at goose
inlet no water had touched his face nor
had he changed a single article of cloth-
ing sleeping eating and digging for
treasure in a suit of corduroys and a flan-
nel shirt purchased in the first instance
from a second-hand store on sixth ave-
nue and much in need of the cleaners
skill then

  he had been sleeping all day for in
spite of the fact that goose inlet was
miles from any human being he clung to
the belief that his uncle of self ridge hall
was on the alert for trespassers on his
property

  therefore he quitted the camp after
supper each night and getting into the
canoe paddled up the inlet and disap-
peared into the swamp where with a
tape-measure a compass and a foot-rule
he went about the little islet up there
following the directions given on the
map of the piratical privateersman for
three nights he had been so employed re-
turning in a surly mood at daybreak wa-
king up donna eating breakfast and
sleeping during the day as the girl
ran breathless at his call he glared at
her and called for food

  the little cove with the shelving beach
was ideally suited to the party for the
early october weather was mild and the
sea-breezes were warded off by the rock
wall hugh and phil had constructed
a couple of  lean-tos one for donna
and one for the men and had spent some
time cutting down young saplings and
firs to protect the motor-car from rain
so that with the evening shadows on the
place and the little fire crackling violet
and orange the place had the atmosphere
and smell of christmas cheer
the hidden hate



  hugh lounged in before phil and lay
on the sands near self ridge watching the
girl as she busied herself with frying-
pan and coffee-pot the red glow on her
dark face as he had first seen it that night
 orton street

   he turned occasionally as a harsh word
from selfridge recalled that person to his
mind hugh stared at the dirty old man
offensively

  his white beard was stained he had
put on a mud-caked hat and taken it off
leaving some of the clay clinging to his
bristly skull and his little eyes were half
hidden by their red rims a sullen devil
was fast growing to life in hughs mind
as he pictured young selfridge develop-
ing into such a man

  the girl understood and threw him
appealing glances

  deliberately hugh turned to the old
man

    as  understand it sir he said in a
calm smooth voice  one-twenty-fifth
of the treasure belongs to mr bemis
and another twenty-fifth to me after
that the money is to be equally divided
between your son and miss donna am
i right -	

  divided growled selfridge look-
ing up  whats to be divided 

   the money from the treasure re-
plied hugh suavely

   selfridge turned his back upon him

   there never was any question of
division he snarled

   and then as phils approaching foot-
steps caused him to turn and put a hand
to the pocket that held a weapon

    dont you be putting foolish notions
into the girls head shes lucky enough
as it is she has no claim on this money
its selfridge money-my money id
look fine dividing it with somebody now
wouldnt i  its money to buy selfridge
hall with

    whats a little shrimp of a girl got
to do with that i m giving her the
chance to be the mother of my sons chil-
dren-of the new selfridge family and
all because shes margarets daughter
not for her own sake the sulky little
brute

   he glared at donna waving his hand

 oh you think youre ill-treated-ill-
treated 

   he fell to muttering letting the sand

trickle between his fingers donna went
about her work as though she had not
been the subject of conversation saying
nothing until she had fried the ham and
the potatoes and taken the coffee off the
crooked stick

   then she warmed the agateware cups
and plates and spread four or five
japanese napkins on a flat rock so as to
make a table-cloth

    suppers ready she announced

  there was no word of conversation
during the meal except frequent requests
from the old man for more food and
drink hugh and phil resolutely avoid-
ed the gaze of each other donrla kept
her eyes on the fire the old man had his
fixed on his plate

   with his little eyes his bristly head
and his thick neck hugh was continually
reminded of a fatted porker bending over
a trough he had grown to hate self-
ridge

   had he been given the faculty of look-
ing impartially upon himself it would
have been flashed upon him that his atti-
tude was ridiculous self ridge had taken
him from poverty and given him the
chance to make a small fortune also it
was through selfridge that he had met
donna hut hugh was in love and he
saw only the little dark girl staring at the
fire

  she had cleared away the supper-
tliings by now washed them in the
stream and returned to the warm sands
the quiet was unbroken save for the
final flap of gull wings as the birds set-
tled down in the nooks and crannies of
the overhead rocks and as for the sea
that great rolling murmur was only the
soother of silence except when an unruly
little whitecap sent a snowlike streamer
through the teeth of inlying rocks

   selfridge sat bolt upright seeming to
count the grains of sand that trickled
through his fingers and the night spread
and spread until even the whitecaps of
the waves were no longer distinguishable
through the gloom of the sea-mist

   presently the old man rose and with
no word went to the edge of the creck
and pushed the canoe into the water a
lighted lantern in his hand they heard
the splash and after the gurgle caused
by the sharp nose of the canvas craft
cutting the quiet water the silence fell


the all-story magazine

again and the two men and the girl
watched the rays of light fall on the
black current on either side until finally
it was no more than a pin-point of ra-
diance that went out like the last glow of
a burned match

  are you superstitious donna
asked hugh suddenly

   youre thinking about the ruby neck-
lace was her unexpected reply the
girl was weirdly intuitive such a person
as mediums desire when they make
 tests  for people worth while con-
vincing it was not therefore strange
that she should have intercepted the
thought-current which ran more swiftly
than the fire burned

  hazily it had occurred to hugh that
if selfridge died donna would be willing
to marry him for then she would have
the half share of the treasure and must
needs deny herself none of the pretty
things she must crave

  to phil it appeared that the ruby neck-
lace might cause selfridges death before
he had unearthed the remainder of the
treasure in which case all the money
would be donnas except a small annuity
that they would allow the flabby-faced
boy along with the necklace itself which
might do for him what it had done for
his father

  as for hugh-he wondered if hugh
could be persuaded to touch the neck-
lace hugh was unfair

  no reason came to phils mind why he
should harbor such a thought against his
chum and this angered him the more
hugh was underhanded that was it-he
was underhanded

  and so the two passions-greed for
gold and love for woman the only real
passions found in the breast of every
human-had changed two lovable boys
into men who looked upon the death of
a fellow creature lightly

  the desire for wealth could by itself
have worked no such transformation
but each knew in his heart that he could
not hope to keep this woman by love
alone she must have love and other
tilings too and up there in the swamp
was the gold that would buy the other
things

  the three eyed one another-phil and
hugh in something like consternation
the girl in a satisfied silent smiling way

  what about the ruby necklace
asked phil hoarsely

  it was one thing to jeer about old
wives tales when in the midst of the sor-
did commonplace-the stone-topped ta-
bles the saucy waitresses the thundering
 l and the whirring trolley-cars but
down on a lonely beach with a crackling
fire and a quiet sea the shadows dwin-
dling and lessening on the sand and the
flap of wings overhead-there was a
chance of seeing the pirate schooner the
dying woman the curse and the knife-
thrust here

   i was wondering said hugh as one
in a daze hears himself talk- i was
wondering if that necklace wasnt in
some way a sort of guard for the treas-
ure whether-whether-it wasnt one
of those things given back to earth with
an invisible guardian

   out in china there is a temple con-
taining wealth beyond reason it has
four doors-silver iron copper gold-
and the tradition is that when a door was
completed a priest killed himself that his
soul might pass into the watching dragon
painted on the door

  what a fool you are cried phil
shivering nevertheless as the shadows of
the flapping birds above swelled into
vampire size with the uproaring flames

  the girl alone seemed unmoved she
was like a salamander finding the fire
all sufficient sitting so close to it that the
red tongues of it seemed to lick her face
without searing it the orange-and-vio-
let flames had died away now and the fire
was red and burning before her like an
altar-flame to a blood-stained goddess

  queer sounds seemed to come from
rocks and water swamp and marsh-land
perhaps it was only the splash of a wild
duck the swish of the swaying reeds or
the groaning of a white birch before a
gust of gale-driven sea-mist as silently
as ever the girl prepared for rest and
went within her lean-to dropping the
bark curtain before it

  phil glancing about uneasily took out
his revolver snapped it open poured out
the cartridges and tested it hugh for
want of something better to do removed
its mate from the holster slung under his
arm the firelight licked them greedily
handsome weapons of blue steel a mono-
gram sprawled on the butt of each
the hidden hate



  when phil without a word of good
night went within the lean-to they
shared with selfridge hugh was still
polishing the revolver with a handker-
chief and seeing pictures in the fire-red
pictures

  presently the weapon dropped from
his lingers to the warm sand and he let
it lay hardly knowing it was-there the
girl wondering at the silence saw him as
she peeped out sitting bolt upright and
staring staring yet seeing nothing

   somehow it seemed that the night was
too quiet

   a faint trdmble assailed the darkness
a feather of gray spread itself upon the
cap of night

  a great castle with turrets of pearl
thrust itself above the mountain of mist
and in the fresh dawn the geese dived
into the marsh-pools and gemmed the
moss with the splashing drops

  phil awoke and as had been his cus-
tom for years reached out a hand to
awaken hugh but hugh was not there

  he struck a match and lit a candle
hughs bed of pine-boughs lay un-
touched the blankets spread above it
phil put out liis head and looked at the
newborn day with its pearls of salt spray
on the bushes and the pink radiance
above the swamp the fire burned on the
beach a pale amber almost unobscured
and unnoticeable in the stronger light of
dawn

   and close to its embers hugh slept

  the fact smote phil with a sense of
injustice he came out of the lean-to
and stood watching the sleeping mans
face hugh was not enwrapped in peace-
ful slumber a scowl on his features ta-
ken in conjunction with a smear of
charred wood just above his right cheek-
bone gave his face a sinister appearance
the scowl was duplicated on phils face
as he turned away

   it occurred to him now that selfridge
had not returned from his nocturnal
search the canoe was not on the shelv-
ing beach his bed of pine-boughs also
was untouched undoubtedly he had
found the treasure then and could not
bear to leave it

  phil set about chopping wood for a
fresh fire opening cans of condensed
food and preparing the coffee still

hugh and donna slept he stripped off
his clothes and got into his bathing-
trunks and jersey plunging into the surf
and swimming far out beyond the break-
ers the battle with the waves set him
all atingle and when he returned he
found that donna was moving about the
fire and hugh was talking earnestly with
her

  changing his wet clothes he joined
the breakfast circle which was as moody
as that of the last supper and with it
over observed curtly that it seemed to
him that the absence of old self ridge
wanted looking into

    oh let him alone said hugh care-
lessly as be went into the lean-to to
change into his bathing - suit he
knows where the camp is and its up to
him to find it

   you go was donnas remark  im
too busy with these things id put on
my wading-boots though he says there
isnt any path into the swamp

   phil buckled on the high boots felt for
his revolver and went off while hugh
advanced gingerly toward the sea don-
na was singing a little spanish song

  no ore seemed worried about the old
man but phil and why he should be
worried he did not know

  but all during the night the ruby
necklace had possessed him filled his
dreams brought him half a dozen times
to the scream of waking a premonition
heavy lead-colored depressing hung
over him the swamp was suddenly a
thing of evil and mystery

  donna had been right about the path
as he drew away from the camp the moss
began to disappear and the soil squirted
up in little jets under his feet a little
ahead he saw tiny water-holes he ad-
vanced to the creek-bed where the water
came up to his hips and waded on past
the curve and out of sight of the camp

   here the inlet became very narrow and
much deeper the water rose over his
hips and soaked him above the waist he
was about to draw back when he saw
caught among the roots of a great weep-
ing-willow tree the canoe he advanced

  the water got no deeper but the bed
sank beneath him he managed to reach
for one of the roots and drew himself
forward his chin coming just over the
gunwale of the canvas boat


the all-story magazine

  he started screamed like a woman
and caught the gunwale capsizing the
canoe

  he seemed to have lost the power of
movement as he sank below the surface
of the water blinded helpless he came
to the surface striking out but not to
save his life only to push away from him
something that was horrible something
that threatened him with an unclean ter-
ror

  again he sank

  in his terror he had forgotten that the
water was not above his head and the
fear of death threw out the mental dread
he struck out furiously now his lungs
stifled as he fought for existence in four
feet of water till the kindly current
caught him and swept him to shore just
below the bend of the creek and upon
firm soil again where he lay unconscious

  and that same current bore another
body ahead of him-the body of an old
man

  but him it did not leave unconscious
nor so far from the camp indeed it
washed it to the feet of donna who was
bending over the breakfast dishes

  and she stood back looking at it when
hugh came from the sea dashing the
spray from his eyes

   he follpwed the girls gaze

  there was a red spot  old self-
ridges head and a red necklace clasped
in his stiffened fingers

chapter v

the murderers weapon

  to look upon the body of a man
foully murdered is to see oneself struck
down by a treacherous hand

  ihe man who speaks callously of
murder has never witnessed one the
call for vengeance the sight evokes is
not love for the dead man but the in-
stinct of animal self-preservation

  if selfridge had been murdered then
so would he hugh coates be mur-
dered

   the treasure said hugh sud-
denly

  the girl shook her head pointing to
the necklace

   you see she said simply  there
was something in it after all

  hugli shook his head and pointed in
turn to the red spot on the old mans
right temple

   ghosts dont use revolvers he said
 the man who did this knew the story
he killed him for the treasure he
hasnt had time to remove it yet hes
in that swamp now and im going to
find him

  he started toward the canoe but
changed his mind

   he can spot me in that it takes
a good man to hit another one who is
swimming

  and with palms together he shot
into the water and swam up goose in-
let he had not far to go before the
body of phil on the sands brought him
back to shore and he bent over his
chum

  reassured by the beat of his heart
and afraid to linger longer lest his
quarry escape hugh swam on up the
creek until he was breasting the swift
current that came out of the black
swamp brushing his cheeks against the
rushes

  the air was that of stormy twilight
and very chill

  smooth green trunks old with the
moisture of ages rose pillar-like about
the stream girdled by thickets of canes
and tall reeds great boughs stretched
out to protect the inky mirror from the
sun boughs from which long tendrils
hung swaying in the cold breath of
the swamp

  dim white flowers starred the dark-
ness clinging to boughsand trunks and
the creeping vines seemed like ghostly
hands reached out to prevent the hardy
swimmer from penetrating the secret
they had shielded so long

  ihe stillness was such that hugh
seemed to hear the very breath of si-
lence

  he had been swimming for some
time before he saw a light burning
ahead of him - a single lonely light
that flowered the blackness round about
with yellow blooms

  softly he swam circling the islet
keeping outside the zone of the lanterns
rays but he heard  voice no sound

  emboldened he came to land and his
naked feet sank into the soft marshy
earth still the silence was unbroken
the hidden hate



  hugh stood stock-still almost afraid
to draw his breath what if after all
the ruby necklace was- but no-
that was all very well before the man
died but now

  still it was not hard to believe un-
der that cathedral dome of darkness
standing beside that inky mirror that
ran so swiftly yet seemed as still as
the grave even the birds and wild
fowl that dwelt within the swamp shad-
ows by night would have none of its un-
natural dark by day it was a thing
accursed set apart - the house of the
dead

  he came forward step by step until
he had picked up the lantern and now
a faint halloo from afar turned him
sick with fear looking quickly about
in the lanterns rays he seemed to see a
newly dug grave the lantern dropped
from his fingers he fell to his knees

  but as he fell he saw the light shine
upon golden coin and knew that what
he had taken for a grave was the dis-
covered hiding - place of the treasure
that had once belonged to a selfridge

  he reached over picked up the lan-
tern again and thrust his free hand
deep into the hole letting it play about
to the tune of chinking gold

  now the halloo came again long re-
peated it was the voice of phil

  hal-loo called back hugh
 halloo-halloo  

  all right sung out the voice
again

    all right

  he heard the plashing of the canoe-
paddle and stepped to the shore of the
islet the lantern in his hand and like
a gray ghost the light boat shot out of
the blackness

  no one here asked phil as he
dragged donna over the marsh

  no one answered hugh the
lantern was still burning the treasures
dug up

  he led them to the place he had taken
for a grave and where the lantern-light
now fell upon rows of rotten canvas
bags belching forth their precious con-
tents into the great oaken chest in which
they lay

   the necklace must have been on
top said donna catching a hand of
each

    	s

  bah said phil bpmis his tone
was strangely harsh  what we want to
look for is the imprint of boot-heels
there were two men  this island last
night one of them killed the other
hell have left his mark

  he took the lantern from hughs
hand and with it circled the tiny islet
donna drew closer to hugh

   youre cold she said  get into
the canoe and go back to the camp and
change into some warm things

  the body interrogated hugh
turning to donna

  it floated out to sea she replied
shuddering a little  a wave caught it
and i was afraid to touch the necklace
did i do wrong in letting it go it
and that terrible necklace i-i was
afraid 

  hugh put his arm about her 

   poor little thing  he said and
stood so when phil flashed the light
again upon them

   find anything phil

  bemis scowled and shook his head

   did you know he asked slowly
 that i found the body 

  you found it interrogated hugh
in surprise you found it why
donna and i-

   i know replied phil  i was
wading up the creek i-it scared me
i overturned the canoe thats the worst
of it there might have been some evi-
dence in it and now its in the bottom of
the creek

  he paused and set down the lantern
on the ground

   go back to the camp and change
your clothes said donna imperatively
catching hughs hand  and bring
back your revolver with you mr be-
miss cartridges are wet his it was
evident that she spoke of selfridge  we
cant find at all hurry now 

   yes said phil  and meanwhile
well have some of this stuff piled up
for you to take back i want to get
away from this place oh no-not the
island-the whole infernal business i
-oh go ahead will you

  he unloosened donnas hand from
hughs and pushed-him toward the ca-
noe hugh picked up the paddle noting
that it was an extra one that they had
kept in camp and pushed off phil knelt


the all-story magazine

down and lifted one of the money-bags
-the gold pieces poured out of it

   say he yelled after hugh  bring
all those sacks of burlap will you
these bags are no good

   all right sang out hugh from
down the creek

   donna settled herself within the circle
of light head between her palms staring
at phil as he lifted sack after sack only
to have it burst in his hands an in-
cautious movement of hers overturned
the lantern for a moment and he rushed
to its rescue before the flame went out

   oh phil im awfully sorry  she
said

  it was the first time she had called
him phil a great wave of tenderness
overcame him at the thought of this lit-
tle girl so utterly alone and unprotected
in the world and he would have caught
her in his arms had not a certain in-
stinctive feeling told him that she was as
much in need of protection from him as
from any one else

  and here on the islet alone with her
he was her guardian

  so with no word he went back to his
unprofitable task of lifting the rotten
bags another burst and as he reached
for yet another his hand closed on some-
thing larger than a gold piece and he
drew it out-a revolver of blue steel its
butt monogrammed

  he stared at it as one would an asp
upon the breast of a loved one for the
moment he believed himself the victim
of an hallucination with dry lips and
parched tongue he stared his mouth
open his eyes dilated

   it couldnt be true 

  he turned his head as mechanically
as though he were an automaton don-
na was sunk in deep meditation seeing
nothing

  with a quick movement he threw the
revolver open one cartridge had been
used

  the revolver dropped into the pocket
of his wet coat he too caught his
head between his palms

  and so the two sat in the light of
the lantern under the cathedral dome
of gloom in the twilight of the silent
swamp before them lay wealth so
great that their minds were incapable of
grasping its significance-louis and doub-

loons sovereigns and eagles reals and
napoleons - below them other chests
with great ingots of gold and silver
hidden between them bags containing
precious stones

 yet neither seemed to heed both were
 as silent as the swamp itself the spell of
 devils magic upon them and so hugh
 found them when he sprang ashore again
 in his corduroys and boots

 he threw some sacking at phils feet

  well come  old fellow he said

  wed better be getting some of this
 stuff down to the camp you and ill
 have to make a lot of trips though
 that canoe wont hold a lot besides one 
 person

  you didnt find your revolver did
 you asked phil turning slowly

  no im blessed if i know what hap-
 pened to it i had it in my hand when
 i went to sleep last night

  i should think said phil still very
 slowly  that the loss of it would worry
 you a good deal with a murderer about
 whos liable to put a bullet into any one
 or all of us at any minute

  it does worry me replied hugh

  i wanted especially to tell you to dry
 out your gun i brought some fresh
 cartridges for you

 he exhibited a handful to phil

  youre sort of careless of your own
 weapons arent you phil returned

 he took the revolver he had found
 from his coat-pocket and handed it si-
 lently to hugh

  i took yours by mistake he said

  there it is

  oh thanks   said hugh

 phil was in the light hugh in semi-
 darkness the latter leaned forward and
 looked at his weapon

  its damp he said

  ive had it in my pocket

 hugh snapped it open just as phil had
 done and the cartridges fell into his
 hand

  why he said suddenly  why-
 why ones missing

  yes replied phil  ones miss-
 ing

 their eyes met phil was glaring at
 him for a moment hugh gaped open-
 mouthed then suddenly hate came into
 his eyes too	 

 the girl seemed to awake
the hidden hate



   im cold she said  im cold
wont you take me back to the camp  

chapter vi

the test

  the canoe sagged under its freight
when the second sack was added and
phil motioned donna to enter following
her and paddling oft hugh was again
alone on the island

  his friend his pal his chum
a murderer and a coward phil had
discovered the body phil had stolen his
revolver so that it might be proven that
he hugh coates had committed the
crime unless hugh was willing to keep
his secret and so he thought to marry
donna and thus gain the treasure

  he was willing to do murder for the
stuff-willing to sacrifice that little girl
to gain the right to call the gold his own

  hugh jerked the revolver out of his
pocket

  yes it was his own-his very own
they had bought them at the same time
in a little gunshop on kearney street in
the days when they went down to san
francisco flushed with temporary suc-
cess there was the monogram sprawled
over the butt

  donna had seen phil hand it back to
him if he hugh accused phil of the
murder phil might say he had found the
revolver anywhere he chose he claimed
to have first seen the body of the mur-
dered man it would be easy to say that
this revolver lay near the body

  and he could pretend that only solici-
tude for his friend prevented him from
accusing him of the crime

  he could ruin him with the one person
in all the world that his heart desired-
donna he could make donna believe
that he hugh was a murderer unless
hugh gave tacit consent to his carrying
out his trick-unless hugh kept silent
and made no attempt to win her

  how careful phil had been to give
him back that revolver while donna lis-
tened how deliberately he had stated
that it was he who first saw the body
how devilishly he had insinuated that a
cartridge had been used 

  and he hugh - what alibi had he
he had been seen late the night before

with the revolver in his hand in the
morning he had forgotten all about it
did not know what had happened to it
until phil had handed it back 

  he saw the hopeless sophistry of the
explanation no phil had contrived it
well-had contrived it so well that if
hugh accused him he would not only be
able to pretend innocence but also would
get a great deal of credit for attempting
to shield his friend it w-ould make a
hero of him in donnas eyes-that miser-
able rat of a phil

  murderer thief betrayer must he
stand aside and see him win the thing he
prized above all others

  the minutes dragged like days fe-
verishly hugh set to work to fill the
other sacks that lay by the open hole and
soon the canoe was back bearing only
phil hugh loaded in four of the sacks
and bade phil continue the work while
he took his turn at the paddle and
out of the swamp he went and back to
the camp where donna was oiling the
machinery of the motor-car

   oh isnt that enough cant you
go back and get mr beniis and let us all
get away from here

  the girls tone was appealing hugh
looked dazedly at the motor-car then at
her a sudden suspicion smote him

   did phil tell you to go to work on
that   he asked abruptly  did he sug-
gest it  

   why yes she replied opening her
eyes in wonder  he said to have it all
ready so that when we had all die treas-
ure in it we can crowd in we can get
away from here dont you want to go
too hugh  

  he nodded

   yes yes yes he kept repeating
 yes yes yes

  overhead a sea-gull screamed a re-
quiem to the lonely body that floated on
the waste of waters - or at least the
birds melancholy cry so came to hughs
ears

  so treachery was to be piled on
treachery on phils last trip down he
would carry off the girl the car the treas-
ure and leave his erstwhile friend on the
little islet where the other man had met
his death

  ill see said hugh and liell

     jf


the all-story magazine

  the girl noted him muttering but said
nothing as she turned away he crossed
to the motor and removed the ignition-
plug

   they cant start without that he
thought as he put it in his pocket  and
ill have the satisfaction of knowing just
how much of a rat he can be

  he stepped back into the canoe
though every impulse within him called
out to warn the girl and to beg her for
himself maybe she expected it too for
her eyes were wistful as she watched the
canoe round the bend and pass out of
sight again

  she seemed very small to be lifting
those heavy sacks into the vehicle that
was to take them back to civilization
but she did it with apparent ease not
for worlds would she have exposed that
strength of muscle to her companions

  nor was she frightened though mur-
der had been done near by she in the
open with all that treasure to guard and
every reason to believe the killer of
selfridge lurked in the vicinity did not
even turn her head in case the criminal
should be approaching

  something of this attitude came to
hughs mind as he paddled back to the
islet poor little girl-her simple primi-
tive faith was touching she really be-
lieved in the legend of the red necklace-
had such faith in the power of the curse
that no thought of a mortal hand oc-
curred to her he doubted if she would
believe that he had committed the mur-
der even if phil accused him she was
so young-so innocent

  as the dark shadows of the swamp
encompassed him again the devil of
hatred begotten by love possessed hugh
he had begun to see good in evil justi-
fying his revengeful thoughts by excuses
which concerned her welfare

  was it right that he should even give
phil the chance to convince her phil
was good-looking and other women had
cared greatly for him donna was
young knew little of men it was ex-
ceedingly probable that she loved phil
and only waited for him to declare him-
self

  in that case she would believe implic-
itly all he said and nothing that hugh
could do would convince her of her
error

  he remembered the revolver in his
pocket phils was wet they would
be alone in the swamp wasnt there an
old biblical saying to justify him- an
eye for an eye   the law took such
offenders as phil and hung them down
here there was no law except that which
men made for themselves was it right
for him to let phil go on his evil way

  but when the canoe grounded on the
islet and he saw phil bending over the
chest of gold the revolver slipped back
into his pocket no matter what justifi-
cation he couldnt shoot his old pal a
thousand little incidents rushed back to
him-incidents of self-sacrifice and kind-
liness on the others part

  there was that time in death valley
when the water gave out and phil pre-
tended to have a full flask when hugh
offered to share his last drink and
phils flask had been as empty as a gourd

  he had tried to hide it too as the
hours passed and perhaps hugh would
never have known had he not taken phil
at his word and believed the other to have
water which he was trying to keep for
himself what a cur he had felt when
phil turned his flask upside down and
hugh knew then that his chum had been
three hours longer without water than
himself

  the picture was as vivid as any
thrown upon a dark curtain and had
phils attitude been in the least contrite
when hugh joined him the memory of
that incident might have impelled hugh
to stretch out his hand and take his
chums promising to stand by him to the
death if he would be honest with him

  for it was not the killing of selfridge
that stood out black in hughs mind it
was the double-dealing had phil com-
mitted a murder and rushed to hugh for
protection hugh would have seen only
the boy lie knew not a murderer and
even to the extent of incriminating him-
self would have given the supplicant
sanctuary

  but phils eyes were as somber as be-
fore and his voice was harsh when he
addressed hugh

   ive got all the gold out of the first
chest theres another one under it
bear a hand will you  

  together they lifted forth the great
oaken box an idea came to hugh
the hidden hate



    thatll float he said  we can put
half a dozen of the bags in it and tow
it down-stream try it

   the chest rested lightly on the water
they placed four burlap bags in positions
that would give it equilibrium it sank
an inch below the water and they added
other bags until the entire treasure re-
maining was stowed away still the
chest had a full two feet above the water-
line and held a steady position hugh
passed a light rope through one of the
brass handles tying a sailors knot exact-
ly in the center of the handle and hard-
ening the knot by the application of
water

  he would try phil would discover if
it was possible for him to be the traitor
he had imagined when he removed the
ignition-plug of the motor-car it would
cost him only a swim to find out phil
couldnt get the car away without that
plug

   you tow the thing down he said
placing the lantern on top of the sacks
of coin  theres not room for two in
the boat with that freight but youve
got to be careful of the current the
momentum of the chestll be greater than
that of the canoe maybe it would be
better to ballast it a bit

  they removed several of the sacks to
the canoe and phil climbed in without a
word there was about forty feet of
thin rope in the canoe one end of which
was attached to the chest the other in
phils hand he knotted his end to an
iron ring set in the stern

   now said hugh pulling the chest
close to shore  you paddle ahead and
ill hold the chest until the line comes
taut when it does ill let go and you
paddle as hard as you can to keep ahead
youve only got about an eighth of a
mile of swamp and once the chest gets
into the open you can let her float any
way she wants to the channels pretty
shallow even if it sank we wouldnt have
much trouble ready

    yes

  hugh heard the dip of the paddle and
felt the rope slipping- thrfeugh his left
hand the current strained at the chest
and it was with some difficulty that his
other hand clasped in the brass handle
held the bulky oaken frame back

   but soon in the light of the lantern

he saw the line lift itself out of the
water until it ran parallel to the surface

he released his hold and the light atop
its precious load floated away its speed
increasing as it reached the center of the
current until it was not long before it
had raced from sight

  now they had all the gold the motor-
car would contain phil knew that for
hugh to leave the islet he must strip
himself of his clothes and swim it
would not be difficult for him to remove
hughs change of apparel from the camp

it was twenty miles to the nearest railway
station so they would have the start of
four or five hours

   it couldnt be planned better

  hugh walked back and sat beside the
hole in the ground it was no longer
possible to distinguish anything but it
seemed less lonesome there

   so alone in absolute darkness he wait-
ed he was on the safe side the igni-
tion-plug in his pocket he had noth-
ing to fear but a cold swim through the
swamp with the disagreeable possibility
of meeting some reptile in the water
but he was as filled with tearing uncer-
tainty as though he risked all

  would phil do it

  and would donna permit him

   he had a loiig time to think it over
the canoe might have returned and made
the trip again and again a score of times
still he waited he was safe and he
wanted to have the full measure of his
friends perfidy

 chapter vii

  only one man leaves this place

  a strangely warm gust of wind
tossed some multicolored leaves into
donnas face as she bent over to assis
phil with the last sack of gold coins
she turned a troubled gaze to him

   it looks like stormy weather she 
said  hadnt you better go back and
get mr coates he must be terribly
lonely up there without even a light
please go ive asked you a dozen
tintts

  a curious mental telegraph exists be-
tween two people who have shared the
same bed and board for many years
hugh had suspected phil of desiring to


the all-story magazine

do a certain thing-the very thing in
fact which was then formulating in
phils mind

  when he had brought down donna
with the first load of the treasure he
had told her to take the boughs down
that sheltered the motor-car so that the
treasure might be stowed away the
sight of the crimson vehicle had how-
ever started a new train of thought in
his mind

   since he had found the revolver no
doubt existed in phils mind that hugh
was guilty of the crime and he rea-
soned just as his friend had done-that
donna was a secondary consideration to
the treasure where hugh was concerned
vengeance upon a friend was out of
the question he philip bemis would
never be a witness against him but to
assist him in his conspiracy to marry the
girl was not to be thought of

 nor did he ever wish to look upon
hughs face again

   under normal circumstances neither
would have believed the other guilty of
the crime and  matter how strong
the evidence each would have gone
frankly to the other demanded his word
as to his guilt or innocence and stood
by him in either case

   but the girl was there and the in-
evitable triangle separated them from
one another as it brought each near to
the apex-herself

  phil was honorable enough he
knew that to tell the girl of his love
while she was alone with him to ex-
plain hughs guilt and ask her to come
under his own protection would be like
offering a home to a friendless child
so now that hugh was safely on the
island he racked his brain for some ex-
cuse by which both he and donna could
take the motor-car away yet speak no
word against hugh

  the reason he evolved was a flimsy
one and he knew it but it was the
best he could think of and it would
have to do

   he lifted his somber eyes to donna
but averted them as he spoke the lie

    hugh isnt on the islet he said
 weve got a clue as to who committed
the crime hes following it out he
told me he wanted us to get away from
here as quick as we could to take the

   motor-car and get away hell meet us
in philadelphia

  he rose to his feet and held out his
hand

   get your things into the car-those
you really need of course leave the
rest here you wont need any of them
now youre rich  

   you mean go away and leave hugh
-mr coates

   why of course phil replied im-
patiently  he wants us to hes
afraid the man who killed mr selfridge
will be down on the camp any minute
with a pack of ruffians and he doesnt
want you to take chances

   oh im not afraid she said slow-
ly adding not with you here
that is

  he turned eyes upon her that flamed
the words he would not say she met
their gaze steadily and patted his
hands

   im not afraid youll protect me
wont you

  but the onlooker would have said
comparing the notes in the voices of
each that it was the boy with the blond
hair that needed protection far more
than this self-possessed little maiden
with the wind-blown locks and the eyes
that forever went back to the look of
tragedy

    yes of course ill protect you he
rejoined covering her rough little hands
with his you know ill protect you
 then well stay until hugh finds
out im not in any hurry to go im
happy here-quite happy and besides
it looks like a storm is coming up id
rather be in this quiet little cove than
in a car where the lightning is liable to
strike one lets cover it up again
shall we phil and then try to find
hugh and bring him back here
no said phil stubbornly no
hugh and i have made our arrange-
ments hes not coming back here
hell meet us in philadelphia i tell
you ive given him an address where
he can find us whats the use of wait-
ing come on wont you donna
she shook her head

not now she said wait until
this storm blows over im sorry
hughs going to be out in it dont
you think you could find him if you
the hidden hate



tried dont you remember what di-
rection lie took i think it was very
unkind of him to go without saying
good-by to me

   it wasnt a clue that would wait
returned phil sullenly  it had to be
followed up then and there it was im-
portant and - er - had to be followed
you understand 

  no i dont was donnas practical
reply  because you havent told me
what the clue was im interested he
was my stepfather tellme

  phil turned away his mouth forming
aimless and profane words he lacked
experience in lying-did not know just
how to begin when he had no men-
dacity ready to his tongue the girl
followed his movements with the eyes
of perception

   i dont just exactly know what is
the matter with you mr bemis she
said in a curious voice

  it sounded so strange that he
wheeled and looked at her but her eyes
were shaded by her lashes and he got
no information there her attitude
brought to his mind the saying that a
man must be masterful with women
the saying was right enough but phil
had forgotten that it applied only to the
women who chanced to be in love with
the masterful men

  masterfulness is well enough to hold
a woman once she was in love but no
man ever won one by masterfulness un-
aided by personal attraction

   now i dont want to quarrel with
you donna he said as quietly as he
could  but were going to leave this
place in just about fifteen minutes you
and i so if theres anything in the
camp that youd like to take along
youd better stow it away-because were
sure going

  she made no response but walked a
little way toward the beach and sat
down looking at the sheets of white
foam that rose over the sea-wall

  a few puffs of warm wind had come
presaging a storm from the south and
the wind blew across the gray moorland
bending the grasses as it riffled the
waves even the stout birches bending
before it

  here and there little spiral twists of
the gale blew the fallen leaves into con-

  centric circles then whirled them high
in air the breeze was sultry and chill
by turns offshore a steamers smoke
trailed behind it parallel with the roar-
ing water but to the sheltered cove
came no breath of the rapidly approach-
ing tempest

  phil followed her to where she sat

   did you hear what i said donna

  she did not seem to hear him she
was watching the rapid home-coming of
the gulls and the geese the former dis-
appearing in the crannies of the rocks
overhead conveying the news of na-
tures fury in unmusical squawks to their
broods of young ones who had not ven-
tured forth the larger birds sinking to
shelter in the dark splotch where hugh
sat waiting beside the place that looked
like a newly dug grave

   i ask you donna did you hear
what  said

  still she pretended not to hear him
and perhaps she did not her eyes
had the appearance of one who meditates
deeply on momentous matters

  never before had phil appeared to
such poor advantage as now when he
stood in an attitude intended to be
threatening but which in view of the
unmoved girl was futile in the extreme
having as it did the appearance of a
small boy endeavoring to bully a sister
older and wiser than himself

  perhaps he realized something of this
sort for he bent over caught her by the
shoulder and spoke hoarsely in her ear

   maybe the winds blowing too much
for you to understand me but i said
we were going to leave here in fifteen
minutes and i meant it do you under-
stand 

  she remained silent and he walked
over to where the motor stood busying
himself with preparing it for the start
she had not changed her position when
he returned attired in his motor - coat
and carrying hers over his arm

   put this on he said his tone
harsh

  she rose and regarded him distantly
somehow it did not seem that the dic-
tatorial manner was a success with this
girl she no longer seemed the child-
ish little one in need of protection

  instead she had the air of one in-
finitely able to take care of herself and


the all-story magazine

preferring much to do so but he had
begun the treatment and his pride
which he took for firmness compelled
him to continue it

   the motors all ready he said
 and were going so put - this on
he handed her the coat  ill throw
the hood over in case it rains but its
liable to be chilly and weve got a long
way to go to get to baltimore

   im not going she said simply  i
thought i told you that im going to
wait here until hugh gets back

   are you in love with that scoundrel
of a hugh he burst out pinioning
her hands are you-are you
again she spoke in the curious tone
she had used before a peculiar glitter
in her eyes which hardened them and
robbed her face of the expression of
youth

   i had quite enough of that once
she said as she removed her hands from
his grasp with an ease that astonished
him no man is ever going to threaten
bully or misuse me again dont you
try it-for your own sake dont 

  it was the tone one uses to a child
phils face flamed with fury and he
caught her hands again this time hold-
ing them in a grip she could not break
unless she did herself an injury but
her eyes regarded him just as steadfast-
ly as before

   ive warned you not to do that she
said  and i shant warn you again
believe me i shant 

  his gesture was despairing as he re-
leased her and his hand was very gen-
tle when it rested  her shoulder

   oh donna he cried  im doing
it for your own good-honestly i am
it isnt for myself its for you dont
think of hugh he isnt worth think-
ing of

   he was my friend and i thought i
knew him but i didnt  didnt he
isnt the right sort youll find that
out hell make your life a hell for
you i cant tell you why but i know
i know wont you believe me

  her face was soft again it held
something like maternal tenderness she
did not want to hurt him

   phil she said  youre an awfully
nice fellow i like you very much
but you shouldnt talk that way about

hugh i dont think hed go back on
you you dont find a friend very often
hes your true friend you ought al-
ways to think of him that way

   and you havent deceived me about
the clue hes discovered and is going to
follow up and afterward is going to
meet us in philadelphia hughs up in
the swamp he cant get back unless
he swims get into the canoe and fetch
him then well all start away together
if you like wont you

   i cant  he almost shouted  i
cant its on account of you wont
you take my word for it donna-
please 

  she shook her head

   i cant believe anything wrong
about hugh and i wont leave him
up there go and get him and then
say what you like

   i will the boy suddenly ex-
claimed  i will on one condition
that youll promise to marry me i
love you donna love you with all my
heart and soul i love you so much
ive been miserable ever since ive seen
you because i was afraid you mightnt
ever care for me

   i was wrong to speak to you the
way i did and i guess it was rotten of
me to knock hugh but-well if you
cared for him id kill him rather than
see him have you yes i might even
kill you too

  the eyes of tragedy seemed to grow
very very old

   you wouldnt kill anybody phil
you couldnt dont say you would it
isnt a thing to be proud of thank
heaven you havent something in your
heart that burns and burns and can
only be put out with human blood be
proud you have a nature like that-a
nature that couldnt do anything that
was mean and treacherous and sneaky

   youre not yourself when you talk
the way you do now youre not your-
self  and heaven pity me ive made
you the way you are let me undo the
work let me get down on my knees
to you and plead never to take the life
of another no matter what reason you
may have to hate youve done some-
thing then that only the creator can
make right you cannot atone

  im sorry its this way between hugh
the hidden hate



and yourself you loved one another
you were so brave so honest so true
i-well no matter- go get hugh
phil and come back ill forget what
youve said he friends again wont
you 

  she was kneeling as she stretched up
her hands to him he drew her up in
a sudden passionate embrace

   donna youre so good so far be-
yond a fellow like me but i love you
say anyhow that you dont care for
any one else give me a chance to win
you ill go back and get hugh ill
even be friends with him if you say so

   but first tell me you dont love
him tell me you never could never
would love him tell me he hasnt got
a chance to win you for if i thought
he had by heaven id leave him in
that swamp to rot till judgment day

   no no-no 

  the girl screamed the words as she
caught phil and suddenly whirled him
about her nails deep in the flesh of his
wrists

   let me go i mean it let me

go 

    yes let her go  said another voice

  he jerked himself free and faced a
man dripping with mud and slime his
wet hair across his forehead face
scratched and bleeding and jaw set
ominously

  for the moment he did not recognize
hugh then his hand went into his
pocket and the revolver came out

  its not wet now he said and
its got dry cartridges in it get back
in the water where you belong you rat
or ill kill you

  hugh lifted a hand and brushed the
hair from hjs eyes which seeming to
take phil little into consideration wan-
dered from the ready motor-car to the
coat that phil wore and the other that
he carried over his arm

   you might have brought me back
to say good-by lie remarked casually
but his tone was that quiet slow one
that phil had heard before when in
tonopah the two of them had played
against a brace game and hugh dis-
covering it had demanded their money
back it was an old gambler he had
spoken to then and though there was
no fear in him he knew the sort of a

man who never drew a revolver except
to shoot the money had been re-
turned

   phils finger trembled on the trigger
and he lowered the weapon

   were going away-donna and i
he said trying to copy hughs tone
were going away understand

   i understand why dont you go 
lie kept his eyes steadily on his old
friend phil could not meet their low-
ering gaze he turned to donna

   get into the car he said  i
mean it get into the car thats
about the only way youll save his life
i didnt want to kill him but he had to
come back and now he hasnt a chance
unless you do what i say get into the
car

   yes get into the car donna ad-
vised hugh  dont you see thats the
only way youll save my life do what
he says

  she looked at him in wonderment for
a moment then crossed and gave him
her hand 

   good-by hugh im sorry

   good-by

  he turned to phil

   if by any chance you should want
to see me in the next few minutes-be-
fore you go of course-why youll find
me up there on the moor so long
as one who is no longer interested
he climbed the declivity leading out of
the cove and made his way across the
gray waste for some time he kept up
a rapid pace then reaching a flat stone
he sat down and surveyed the angry
rolling sea and the black masses of
clouds that were piling up overhead

  the wind had begun a persistent
howling the surf was booming in his
ears a sailing-ship showed stark spars
as it was tossed high then sank until
only the tip of its mainmast could be
seen from shore

  the uproar was such that he did not
hear phil even when the latter shouted
at him but he looked up as the wind
brought a whiff of gasoline to his nos-
trils and saw his friend standing there
face white fingers twitching

   i thought maybe youd want to see
me again before you went i thought
you couldnt go like that now that
youre here what do you want  


the ali-story magazine

   you know what i want was phils
response as he stepped back holding
the leveledrevolver close to his waist-
line  come across with it

    sec said hugh suavely  im to
give you the means of running off with
the treasure and the girl am i well
now where do i come in you dont
seem to have figured on me wanting any-
thing thats inconsiderate where do
 come in

   theres as much treasure left as
weve taken answered phil  thats
yours its not my business how you
get it away hide it somewhere else
and come back and dig it up again 
shant bother you but give me that
ignition-plug and be quick about it or
you wont do any bothering about treas-
ure or anything else

  hugh pointed to the flat stone

  see that well put your revolver
there ill put the plug beside it then
well have a talk this world isnt big
enough for both of us ones going to
go across thatll be the one that wins
were pretty evenly matched agreed
suits me ready

  both crossed to the stone both made
a long arm and placed something there
both moved away phil tossed off his
motor-coat hugh watched him intently

   now ive got a lot to say to you
you listen to me and then ill listen to
you i want the truth you understand
even if i have to choke it out with my
hands you neednt be afraid of tell-
ing me because only one of us is going
to leave this place

chapter viii

the fight ox the cliff

  ttiev were two men alone with a
wind-swept sky and a stormy sea a part
of nature in its turbulent mood

  they stood close to one another almost
shouting for the roar of the surf and
the howl of the wind gave the normal
tone but little chance to be heard

   i want you to understand my posi-
tion phil youve been my friend-a
good friend-a stanch friend no mat-
ter what happened id a swore that
youd been there waiting to do the right
thing

   ive heard a lot about moncy-lust
but i didnt think you were the kind to
fall for it but you have youre all
the things a man oughtnt to be

   understand im on to you you
might as well make a clean breast of it
before we find out which is the better
man but even now im willing to give
you a chance stay here in this place
and let me take donna away thats my
last word

  that all you got to say

    thats all

   all right then now you listen to
me

  he paused gathering breathy for tlio
long sheets of pale-green water were
bursting over the sea-wall into mountains
of foam and with the crash of heavy ar-
tillery

   you say youre on to me well if
youre talking about my leaving you on
the island all right it might have been
a shine trick if youd been on the square
with me-but you werent i found your
revolver in that treasure-chest

   heaven knows you- must a been
crazy to have left it there but i found
it all right now some people would
have run straight to somebody else and
toldem about it but i didnt and i
havent yet donna doesnt know you
killed selfridge and i didnt have any
idea of telling her

   i just handed back your gun to you
to let you know i was on that looks
like a pretty good friend doesnt it
and i was going to leave you here with
the rest of the coin wasnt i  do you
think i would have split to the police
about it not me ive been on the level
with you hugh coates and i dont want
you to fight until you know ive been-
too

  hugh stared at him seemingly trying
to read his mind then he threw back his
head and laughed more harshly than the
sea-birds screamed-laughed long and
laughed loud

   id thought thats what you had
planned out in your mind he said pres-
ently an evil sneer on his face  i about
sized you and your scheme up you
pup 

  scheme-what dyou mean you
wont have the face to say you didnt
kill selfridge why ive got it on you
the hidden hate



               i found your revolver there on the islet
               you didnt sleep in your bod last night
               why you-

                 lord-what an actor you are  
hugh stepped back and viewed him
aghast was it possible to have lived
with a man all the years that he had
l	lived with hugh to find him in one illu-

               minating instant the greatest scoundrel
               in the world

                 actor what are you talking about
              you dont dare to say you didnt kill
              selfridge i tell you ive got it on you
              ten ways from the jack i thought you
              were going to be on the square-

               hughs laugh was more like a growl
             now

               do you think youve fooled me for
             a minute 

                he advanced toward phil with clenched
              fists

                let me tell you something from
             the minute you handed me that gun i
             knew what you were going to do i can
             see what you did last night as plainly as
             if i did it myself

                ha-thats good  guess you can
phils angry sneering face was close to
his hugh caught him by the chin and
held his head in that position

                 i dont think you started out with
              that intention but when you saw my
              gun where it was you thought that
              would stand for your acquittal oh i
              see you and now let me tell you some-
              thing else selfridge wasnt killed on
              the islet he was killed right down
              here by the camp-fire

                 he came back with the necklace in
              his pocket and he was showing it to you
              or i guess he was holding it up to the
              fire when you hit him across the head
              with the canoe paddle  noticed the
              paddle when i came back the last time-
              the time i took this ignition-plug there
              were two canoe paddles he used the
              one with the blue streak when he went
              away last night and thats that paddle
              	that lies under the motor-car right now

               while the red one is the one that floated
               down with the canoe you see you for-
               got that phil bemis

                  so thats how it was done breathed
               phil  thats how it was done 

                 then you saw he was dead and you
              lost your nerve you wanted it to look
              as if somebody else had done it so you

carted his body into the canoe and rowed
him up to the island and left the lantern
and my revolver there then you came
back and left the canoe in the bushes
are you going to confess  

   confess when youve just told me
how you did it are you insane come
 wont kill you  see how it is youve
gone mad mad good-by

  phil sprang toward the stone where the
revolver lay but hugh was on his back
before he had taken two steps

   so you cant even be square at the
-last deal well its your finish ive
got the back-hold and you neednt yell
for mcrcy when i get you down

  h is fingers gripped phils neck
phil gurgling fell back on him his
right hand groping for a sheath-knife in
his pocket hugh knew the pocket and
knew the knife a present to phil on his
birthday and-the sardonic humor of it
-from him

  he loosed a hand about phils neck
and reaching down caught the groping
fingers which had found the weapon
phils other hand had caught hughs
throat now and hugh with a beast-like
howl forced the hand holding the knife
back and farther back until the fingers
loosened their hold on it and it fell to
the ground but in the same moment
the fist doubled and the arm flew for-
ward breaking its skin against hughs
teeth

  then with blood upon them they
rolled to the ground fighting and claw-
ing like two panthers

  each man had released the others
throat but hughs arms were locked
about phils neck in an endeavor to force
back phils head until the slender column
that supported it should break and the
head fall helplessly to the sands

  phil in desperation gripped hugh
about his middle and dragged him up
again lifting him in air and bringing
him down hard upon his feet the old
trick that has broken many a mans back

  but in this effort phil left the upper
part of his body wholly unguarded and
hugh crooking one arm about the back
of his neck reached down and pinioned
phils left wrist then using his oppo-
nents body as a lever he drew phils
head down to his chest

  now they stood almost motionless


the all-story magazine

the sweat running from their bodies
phils eyes staring into death their
muscles were strained to the breaking-
point

  but no mortal man could hold out
under the pressure with a groan of
agony phils grasp weakened and his
body grew limp he fell forward with
hugh under him

  swiftly hugh reversed the positions
then springing up he snatched the re-
volver from the stone and in his blind
fury of hate leveled it on the man who
was now on hands and knees striving
pitifully for the strength to rise

   youve got a minute to live in
grated hugh  one minute got any
prayers to make

  phil turned to him a face gray with
pain but barren of a request for mercy
with a long breath lie drew himself to
his feet and tottered a few steps forward

   you murderer you thief you
traitor  hugh shrieked above the storm
trying to steel himself for the deed he
had sworn to do  do you deserve to
live no and im not going to let
you live your minutes up 

  his finger trembled on the trigger as
he tried to force himself to shoot but
his will was no longer his own

  mad with rage he shook the weapon
at the man before him

   you think  wont shoot but i
will-i say i will

  hugh-hugh came a voice from
afar

  he turned his eyes and saw donna
running fleetly toward them

   dont--dont - dont-shoot  she
gasped as she stumbled close to him and
fell on her knees  dont hugh dont
for heavens sake dont 

chapter ix

the murder confessed

  the revolver fell from hughs sha-
king fingers and he stared dazedly from
the white face of the girl to the gray lips
of phil which mouthed inarticulate
words he had fallen to his knees
again and was crawling toward the
fallen revolver

 you love him-you love phil  

    love phil 

  her tone was as hopeless as it was
bitter

    oh if i only could-if i only could 
but my heart had not been trained to
love but to hate there is no room for
love in it now why didnt you kill me
im not fit to live if youd only killed
me-if you only had 

  hugh gaping at her had not seen
phil grasp the revolver that lay at his
feet but the girl had and reaching
down she caught the crawlers wrist ex-
erting a strength- equal to his own and
tearing the weapon from his grasp

    pity me  she cried her tragic eyes
turned to the stormy sky  heaven pity
me for ive made you both beasts like
myself listen that is heavens an-
swer

  a great crash of thunder drowned the
words and a sword of flame pierced the
black clouds casting a terrible light
upon the dark waters the cold rain
fell upon her upturned face

   i have done it all but i did not
mean that you should suffer i was
afraid i thought only of shielding my-
self i killed him yes i killed him 

    in pitys name wailed phil  tell
us which one you love which one you are
trying to shield i take it all back if
you love hugh i will go away and never
never see either of you again but tell
us-tell us

  you do not believe me you think
i am trying to shield one of you oh
you are blind you cannot see the dark
places because you love me oh im
bad clean through im not worth either
of you even if i could love but i
cant

    i tell you i was born with the devil
in my heart if id met the right man
before my mother married him it would
have been different ive been a woman
for the last three years-we southrons
mature early-but they didnt know it
and they treated me like a child my
fathers friends had shown me something
of the life a pretty woman should lead
and i wanted that life then too i
loved my mother-loved her more pas-
sionately than you can understand-for
no doubt you have had others to love
you and i had only her she married
selfridge

    at first we were happy enough  but
the hidden hate



   then he found that map of the treasure
   aiid his one idea was to get enough
    money to come down here- and dig it up
   he could have got some one to lend him
   the money but he was afraid theyd rob
   him and so he put my mother and me to
   a life of drudgery while his pasty-faced
   son went to college and spent the money
   that i saved him by washing the dishes
   and making the beds

     my mother was uncomplaining and
  so i stood it otherwise - well there
  were many paths i could have taken
  are you listening are you beginning to
  understand the kind of a girl i am
  when you do itll be easy for you to be-
  lieve that i killed him

    their faces were stony expressing
  nothing

      then i thought that after all it was
   only for a year and then we would be
   very rich he hadnt said anything then
   about keeping all the treasure for his son
   it was to be equally divided between my
   mother and himself

     meanwhile my mother wasted away
  lefore my eyes but i was blind and
  didnt understand you see hed calcu-
  lated to a nicety just how much money
  it took to run the house and he gave her
  just that much every week but she
  wanted me to go to dancing-school and
  learn languages and all that so she told
  me she had a little saved away and that
  would pay for it

     and i believed her but do you
  know what she was doing sitting up
  until four and five in the morning ma-
  king lace undergarments and then get-
  ting up at seven to make the fires

      you see i thought we were going to
   share the money-she and i and i pic-
   tured myself making a marriage that
   pleased her and giving her a little grand-
   daughter and being respected for her
   sake-her sake 

      and all the time she was dying that
   college boy of his was living on the fat
   of the land while she would pretend
   to have eaten so that i might have more

     then she died-from overwork and
  worry the one thing in all the world
  that i loved

     oh i hated him because he had
  worked her so hard but i didnt hate
  him enough to kill him then not even at
  her funeral-because you see i thought

he meant to be fair-i thought he in-
tended to keep his word and share the
treasure with her and besides he had
worked very hard too even if his son
was spending money so what she had
done he had done too

   but after her death when i saw that
the only reason he had killed my mother
was a desire to bring his family back into
their silly little position the hate began
to grow in my heart and when i looked
at horace and he told me that since his
father wished it he supposed hed have
to marry me

   i thought it was a joke at first my
mother had died working for the money
and i wasnt bad enough to marry that
flabby horace just for the money

    really thought it was a joke but
 found out that he meant it unless i
married horace i could go into the
street and find my living the best way i
could

    gave him every chance but he
meant it he thought nothing of me or
of anybody else i dont think he even
thought of horace it was his petty
family name - selfridge - and horace
was the last of the selfridges every-
thing was for that

   so last night when he came back
from the islet and you two were asleep
i was up and waiting for him and when
i heard the canoe grate on the beach i
couldnt wait but ran down to meet him

  he didnt wait to get out before he
stirred all the hate in me again for he
threw the paddle at my feet and while
he still sat in the canoe unwrapped the
necklace from a piece of burlap and sat
there gloating over it while it shone red
from the light of the camp-fire and it
might well be red for it cost my mothers
life

   he said it would all be for horace
that he would entail the estate as they do
in england so that the selfridge name
would always be kept up and then i
told him quite calmly that my mother
had died to gain it and i had slaved for
her sake and that  wanted my share

   but he laughed and said it was for
the selfridge name then i told him
furiously  if you do not give me half
i will kill you  

   he knew i meant it too for he
reached for his revolver


the all-story magazine

   i caught up the canoe paddle and
struck him across the head and lie fell
back in the canoe then i was afraid
i didnt think  had killed him and i
thought he might kill me so i picked up
your revolver hugh as it lay by the fire
and took the blue paddle and got into the
boat with the body and rowed up-stream
his head dangling over the gunwale
she covered her face with her hands

   then as we were passing a tree that
swept the water one of the branches
pushed his head forward-a-ah and
i shot in fear and trembling-and that
was the shot that killed him it was not
wanton believe me i was very much
afraid

   but how-how did you-you leave
the canoe up there was phils trem-
bling question

   it was low tide then and the marsh-
land was not under water i left the
canoe and put the necklace in his hand
and threw his revolver into the river-bed
 kept hughs revolver under my clothes
all the time afterward and then when
the three of us were on the islet and phil
talked about finding a clue i grew afraid
and knocked the lantern over and then
shoved your revolver hugh down deep
amid the treasure where phil found it

   but after i had done it and i saw
you two who had loved each other burn-
ing with hatred some little part of me
that was good told me what i was but
it did not triumph until just now when
phil walked away to find you

  even then i said ill marry the
one who wins but-i couldnt

   and thats all the story-except he
didnt float out to sea i took the neck-
lace out of his hands and pushed his body
off i-i hated him and im glad
lies dead  but you-

  she crossed over and picked up the
ignition - plug and the revolver and
walked away they followed her dazedly
when she reached the cove she held it
up then fitted it in place

   this wont cause any more trouble
im going to take jt away and all the
treasure that is in the car the remain-
der is yours good - by say - say a
prayer sometimes for your little donna-
the one you thought she was 

  the chug-chug of the motor sounded
above the shriek of the storm they

watched the car mount the declivity and
disappear

  for a long time they stood motionless
the rain was falling in great sheets but
they did not feel its sting

  out to sea the rocks showed jagged
and white for the roaring breakers leaped
too high in air to touch them a dark-
ness as heavy as that of night had fallen
but through it they could see the great
pillars of foam

  with a persistence that seemed to
keep a mountain of spume always above
the face of the cliff the breakers rolled
in upon the rocks bellowing through the
darkness like tortured white giants bound
to the sea-wall and rising ever to the full
length of their chains

  yet through it all the two men stood
motionless until the storm swept over
their heads and the foaming helpless
waves began to calm in the waning breath
of the tempest with their falling the
tide rose assaulting the shores with
crashing shocks that vibrated the ground
they stood on like minor earthquakes

  soon they looked across a lonely sea
where the blackness was changing tor
gray and from which the gentler breeze
brought the tang of salt to their nostrils

  it seemed that the wind had died down
altogether and the black water had no
break in it but came in long and strong
but gentle as the caress of a favorite dog

  behind the cloud-banks broke the glow
of smoldering fires a streamer of red
touched a wave and turned it to gold
and the two men came out of their
dream

  as though not sure of their awaken-
ing they stepped cautiously for fear
they were sleep-walking after all side
by side speaking no word they gazed
about the cove

  a sense of desolation oppressed them
the wind had torn down their rough
shelters of wood and bark their blan-
kets and clothing lay in wet heaps and
as with one accord they ascended the
declivity they saw far in the distance a
tiny speck that they knew for the fast
disappearing motor

   shes gone for good muttered
hugh or for evil heaven help any
other men that fall in with her

  silent again he came back to the cove
and now phil was muttering
the petaluma product



   the treasure - weve got the other
half well-weve got that and well
splif it with old selfridges son yes
well do the square thing

  but neither looked at the other until
the streamer of sun found its way into
the cove and touched with a lurid finger
the ruby necklace that the girl had
thrown from her as the motor - car
whizzed away

   with a sudden wild cry hugh kicked
 it far out to sea then turning suddenly
 he met the wistful eyes of his old-time
 friend

   tears hot and smarting sprang to his
 eyes

   and as he stretched out his hands he
 saw that phil too was weeping and
 they were not ashamed to fall in each
 others arms

end

the petaluma product

              by kenneth macnichol

 ghowing why the potted om-
 elet was postponed and a
 whole county became chicken-fed

there was a frenchman did
it once said mcadams
 musingly his remark being
without relation to conversa-
tion gone before

  did what inquired sweeny the
head capper who ofton had difficulty
in following the processors train of
thought

   canned eggs answered mcadams
in the same grave tone

   huh   incredulously

   sure so you could make an omelet
of em  keep a thousand years just like
canned peaches

  then why aint it done now
questioned sweeny

   dont know how answered the
process-man  i read all about it in a
hook that the ol man has in the office

i	guess the frenchman did it all right
the book says that he was the daddy of
the canning industry an the only
frenchy that ever canned french peas
without putting in copperas to make em
green an he canned eggs sos you
could make an omelet of em afterward
just like i said sure

   huh  vociferated the capper again
and then fell silent meditating on the
process-mans remarks

  the big cannery was veiled with dark-
ness  the machinery was stilled after the
days work and the immense process-
kettles gave vent to labored grunts and
groanings as the scalding imprisoned
steam combated the germs of ferment in
sterilizing the last  cook

  with the exception of the night-watch-
man flushing out peelings at the other
end of the building only the head
process-man mcadams and the head
capper sweeny remained to finish the
labor of the day sweeny had stopped
his soldering-machine half an hour be-
fore and having supplied the machine
with new spools of gleaming wire-solder
and washed the last traces of lead and
acid from his hands had come into the
process-room to hold converse with mc-
adams while the process-man lingered
to remove the last of the shining cans
from the cooking-tanks

  mcadams had two interests in life-
hens and new methods of canning fruit
other things are perhaps necessary in
the complicated social arrangements of
modern civilization but the world known
of mcadams lay between his chicken-
ranch at petaluma and the plant of the
associated canneries company in san
francisco where for seven years five
months in each year he had been the
court of last resort in the process-room

  sweeny whose pets were the big sol-
dering - machines had no fads but
he had a lively respect for the processor
therefore no matter how far mcad-
amss thoughts might carry him afield


the all-story magazine

in pursuit of poultry and canned goods
sweeny never allowed himself more than
a negative questioning it might be
said however that concerning the pos-
sibility of canned eggs he had certain
silent doubts

   it was just as well that his silence
 remained unbroken for the process-man
 was already fostering an incipient idea
 and to flout an idea is to drive spears at
 the heart of friendship the next day
 when mcadams came to work besides his
 dinner-pail he bore in his hand a bulging
 paper sack which he deposited carefully
 in the little closet where he kept his
 sirup-stained overalls and jumper

   that night and for many nights there-
 after as soon as work was finished the
 processor retired to the  kitchen as the
 little laboratory was called where the
 apparatus was kept that was used in the
 testing of sirups examining fruit that
 showed a tendency to spoil and working
 out the problems that presented them-
 selves almost daily during the canning
 season

    must be workin night - shifts the
 night-watchman remarked to himself as
 night after night a light glowed in the
 kitchen until long after an hour when it
 might be supposed that a man who had
 spent the day in directing the movements
 of three-ton trays of canned goods would
 feel the need of honorable repose nor
 did the processors lapse from regular
 habits go unnoticed in the office

    do you suppose that mcadams can
 be drinking asked el well the compa-
 nys manager of the bookkeeper

    never knew him to touch a drop
 answered the bookkeeper and he has
 been here every season since i came

    well his actions are very strange
 rejoined the manager doubtfully  looks
 as though he had been going the pace
 and this morning i just caught the stack-
 ers in time to prevent their piling up
 twenty-eight cases of tomatoes that he
 had seiit out marked peaches-that when
 there hasnt been a peach in the house
 for a week i think ill have to speak to
  him

   this was as far as the threatened
 wigging proceeded for it happened that
 mcadams spoke first giving an entirely
 satisfactory explanation of his preoccu-
 pation that same night after the

 cooling-vats had received their last load
 of steaming cans the processor ap-
 proached the capper with an air of
 secrecy generally supposed to character-
 ize the conspirator against governments

  armed with a can-opener and bearing
a grimy can plentifully bedaubed with
soot mcadams took the wondering
sweeny by the sleeve and gently yet in-
sistently led him away to the kitchen
once inside the processor locked the
door and seizing the knob shook it
violently to be certain that it was fast
he placed his treasure lovingly upon the
table then pointed dramatically at the
sooty can

   had it on the boiler five days tem-
perature one hundred and two degrees
warranted to spoil anything in a can if
it is spoilable - but it couldnt spoil
that 

  with a very successful although un-
conscious imitation of macbeth bran-
dishing his dagger mcadams attacked
the can at the first plunge of the can-
opener there was a sound as of escaping
steam sweeny sneezed

   gas said mcadams laconically
 germicide  fermenticide absolutely
harmless-absolutely

  out from the opened can he rolled a
dozen objects into a plate that restedon
the table-soft white globules that re-
sembled thin cases of rubber tissue filled
with liquid

   eggs canned eggs  

  huh exclaimed the wild-eyed
sweeny but theyre soft

  sure answered the processor
 treated em with dilute hydrochloric
irfakes em soft-sos they wont break
like a prestidigitator executing a feat
of legerdemain mcadams reached under
the table and drew forth a tiny frying-
pan

   will you kindly light that bunsen
lamp for me he said gravely

  into the pan he put a spoonful of oil
and then taking four of the transformed
eggs he tore the tough envelope between
thumb and finger and placed the con-
tents in the pan over theighted bun-
sen lamp he waved the pan from whence
presently proceeded a savory odor

  a deft movement of a spatula turned
the mass and when it had reached the
desired state of consistency mcadams
the petaluma product



inverted the pan over another plate
turning to the admiring sweeny with a
low bow

  omelet made from canned eggs
that would keep a thousand years in
the history of the canning industry two
men have turned the trick the frenchy
-and mcadams

   huh said sweeny because it was
the only sound he found ready on his
tongue as he reached a tentative finger
toward the plate

   take it along-take it along  said
the processor insistently directing the
capper toward the door  plenty more
where that came from ive got a little
work to do to-night-so good-by 

  with the last word sweeny found
himself outside the door with the result
of the processors wizard cookery still in
his hands he tasted in hesitation

  well ill be jiggered he ex-
claimed a moment later  tis an ome-
let an a good un at that but im
blessed if i ever see an omelet made like
that before 

  in the morning mcadams the proces-
sor held an interview with p b elwell
manager of the associated canneries in
the office something of the same scene
was enacted that he had rehearsed with
sweeny the night before but this time
his eyes sunken with gazing for many
nights into various testing-vessels blazed
with the light of an inventors enthusi-
asm

   the theory is this he explained
 you cant cook an egg to can it or you
have boiled eggs the egg must be
canned wivhout cooking now with
fruit the germs of fermentation are all
 the outside sterilize the fruit kill the
germs-and there you are  but an egg-
shell is porous and the germs get inside
the egg there is your problem-to kill
those germs without boiling or spoiling
the egg

   theres only one way to do it-thats
my way i soften my egg-shells so they
wont break i fill the cans then put
them into a retort and exhaust the air-
air contains germs the eggs have first
been partly sterilized by dipping into a
germicide now an egg-shell contains
air but it is built to withstand the nat-
ural air-pressure and no more

   into my retort  introduce at a

	s	 v

heavy pressure a gas of my own inven-
tion that is germicidal and fermenticidal
it penetrates the egg-shell-drives out the
air-kills the bacteria without injuring
the flavor of the egg-the can is sealed
in the retort without further contact with
the air-gas in the can and gas in the
egg-and there you are 

   it is a cold process from first to
last no bacteria no fermentation-and
the egg dont spoil 

  at this point the manager was ready
with an interruption but mcadams
waved down his words with a gesturing
hand

   in considering the commercial side
of my invention let me give you a few
facts the food value of eggs is higher
than that of the best meat a dozen
eggs weigh a pound and a half a pound
and a half of beefsteak costs thirty-five
to forty cents i live at petaluma the
greatest egg center on this earth or any
other earth where most of the year eggs
can be bought for fifteen cents a dozen
at that rate a dozen canned eggs can
be sold at twenty-five cents every day in
the year with a big profit to the canner

    aise hens myself i know the hen
from beak to tail i know what she can
do a good hen will produce one hun-
dred and eighty eggs a year-fifteen
dozen eggs the cannery could own its
own hens but at petaluma there are over
a million hens producing eggs and that
is a very conservative estimate

   a cannery at petaluma could take
care of the whole product six months in
the year think what that means nine-
ty million of eggs in six months seven
million five hundred thousand cans a
dozen eggs in each can three hundred
and twelve thousand five hundred cases
twenty-four cans to the case of canned
eggs

   i tell you the meat trust will go
down and out-theres the question of
supply and demand-we can raise more
liens if we need em will people buy
beefsteak when they can get canned eggs
at twenty-five cents a dozen at the nearest
corner grocery  i say no 

  mcadams paused for breath

   i suppose mr mcadams said the
manager suavely  that you have some
definite purpose in telling me these
things 


the all-story magazine

   sure  said the astonished inventor
 i want five thousand dollars to start
an egg cannery at petaluma you to take
a half  interest and a half interest to
come to me as legitimate reward for the
invention

   just so continued the manager
 now while i am not so sanguine as
yourself in regard to the venture which
is but natural yet you seem to have some-
thing very good and  have been much
interested in what you have told me 
must have time however to confer with
my associates if you could leave a can
or two with me which you have already
prepared-

  his enthusiasm slightly abated mc-
adams groped in his bulging pockets
and presently extricated two more of the
grimy cans smaller than the others

   these are some of the first he said
with only a half-dozen apiece in em
but theyre just the same as the one you
saw

  very well said mr elwell and
if you will call on me to-morrow eve-
ning i may say that i hope to give you
a favorable answer in the meantime 
think that the process-room needs your
attention we cant spare you there for
the present you know to-morrow eve-
ning-dont forget

  smilingly the manager bowed mc-
adams to the door arid not until the
processor had retreated to his own do-
main did he think how easily he had been
dismissed

   these business men are a smooth out-
fit he mused scratching his auburn
pate  but he said that he hoped the
answer would assuredly be favorable to
me

  the answer was favorable and with-
in forty-eight hours mcadams hen fan-
cier processor and inventor of canned
eggs found himself the prime stock-
holder in the petaluma canning and
packing company a corporation to be
capitalized at two hundred thousand
dollars and destined to exploit in a new
way the world-wide renowned petaluma
product

  also mcadamss temperate opinion
in regard to the merits of his own in-
vention was raised to a point that
threatened to sterilize the blood corpus-
cles in his body one might have thought

that even his hair flamed a more fiery
aureole abouthis brow

ii

  the newly elected directors of the
petaluma canning and packing compa-
ny were holding their first conference
session in the companys recently ac-
quired offices in san francisco at the
head of the long table sat mr p b
elwell president and general manager
of the new company suave formal
courteous the man of business sans
reprochc

  at the foot of the table sat mr john
mcadams the principal stockholder
complacent over his elevation to high
places yet somewhat uneasy because of
the unwonted armor of starched linen
in which he was incased around the
table were ranged the other directors
these for the larger number being stock-
holders in the associated canneries
company

mr elwell addressed mr mcadams

   you understand mr mcadams
that while the company is non-produc-
tive  as one of the directors would not
feel that we were doing justice to the
stockholders should we offer you an ex-
orbitant salary for your services as su-
perintendent i should say that about
four hundred dollars per month in-
creased to five hundred when the plant
is in operation should be a figure satis-
factory to all parties

  sure said mcadams imperturba-
bly after he had restrained a gasp of
amazement by grasping hard at the arms
of his chair  that suits me all right
but  would like to have sweeny in on
it

   as superintendent mr mcadams
you will be at liberty to employ such help
as seems necessary paying reasonable
salaries to your assistants i think it
would be well for you to go at once to
petaluma to oversee the building now
being done

   it should not be over a month at the
latest before we install the machinery
then there are the contracts with the
chicken-ranchers and so forth but i
think that we need not worry the di-
rectors with those

 you can draw on the treasurer for
the petaluma product



such money as you need all accounts to
be subject to the approval of the directors
at each quarterly meeting i think that
is all gentlemen  

   move we adjourn yawned a heavy
man with a broad expanse of shirt-front
who had been nodding sleepily in his
chair

  the motion was carried and after
shaking hands with each of the other
directors john mcadams lately in-
vested with a title in plutocracy took
his way to the elevator of the big office-
building

  the next day he boarded the train for
petaluma and as a commentary on man
as he is the first thing mcadams did
upon his arrival was to smash with an
ax the neat chicken-brooders that he had
carefully constructed from store-boes
not six months previously

   no more chicken-raising for mc-
adams  although he assured him-
self  ill buy a few pairs of fancy thor-
oughbreds as soon as i can get a place
where i can take care of them

  for be it known that mcadams was
a bachelor and his home generally char-
acteristic of a bachelors housekeeping

  the construction of the new cannery
was hurried forward with all possible
despatch nor did this latest packet
launched on the deep waters of com-
mercialism lack for heavy winds of free
advertising to speed it on its way

  mcadams was somewhat opposed to
this form of notoriety when it became
impossible for him to purchase a sunday
paper without seeing his own picture
staring out at himcaptioned forth as the
veracious representation of the face of
mcadams the inventor of canned eggs
it might be said that mcadams was not
handsome but to his objections elwell
had one unanswerable reply

   we have an absolutely new product
to get upon the market and the more free
space we get now the less we will have
to buy presently for advertising

  mcadams forswore his colored sun-
day supplements and gave his entire at-
tention to the building and thereafter
the reporters who scented a good story
at petaluma were perforce content to
slake their curiosity in looking at the
great glass cases where the cans were to
i- sealed

  mr mcadams refused to talk for pub-
lication and he refused to be made the
victim of a snap-shot

  at last the plant was complete
wagon after wagon laden with eggs
rolled up to the platform and were dis-
charged of their fragile burden smoke
belched from the great chimney for the
first time gas machines began to purr
-cans to rattle-soldering - irons to
smoke

  fifty girls stowed away the softened
eggs into cans that were trucked away
to the glass cases where sweeny master
of a new trade sealed them under pres-
sure   gas in the can and gas in the
egg-and there you are 

  the success of the experiment could
not be doubted there were the eggs-
there were the cans-there were the
canned eggs ready to be served in ome-
lets boiled fried poached burned friz-
zled or baked for the breakfast of the
world

  mcadams was jubilant and content
elwell hurried away to chicago to con-
tract with the jobbers for the disposal of
the new product

 one week-two weeks-a month
passed the business grew common-
place a new industry had been born
it was a healthy child and flourished ex-
ceedingly long since wonder had de-
parted from the minds of the petaluma
chicken-ranchers contemplating this new
imposition on the patient hen and they
hauled their eggs to the cannery with as
little curiosity as an orchardist might dis-
play in disposing of his product in the
same way

  each uiorning in the cannery live
thousand rans a dozen eggs in each can
ere trucked away to one of the two
warehouses the pack of the previous day

  it has been said that mcadams was
jubilant in the excess of his intemperate
joy he forgot a single fact in natural
history to wit the neurotic temperament
of the mother of the egg who imparts
her capricious nature to her offspring-
a nature indeed difficult to pacify came
a morning when mcadams surprised a
stacker from the warehouse bearing on
a shovel to the outer air a bursted can
which exhaled an unmistakable odor

  leak inquired mcadams without
interest for leaks and swells are a loss


the all-story magazine

definitely counted upon in all canning
operations

    well if it is the stacker answered
 i couldnt lind it an this makes
about a dozen that ive carried out in the
last few days but  couldnt find a leak
in the lot

  mcadams hurried to the warehouse
where he remained the entire morning
tapping can after can with a bit of heavy
wire and listening eagerly to the sound
that they gave forth

   altogether he found perhaps two doz-
en cans that showed signs of  venting
he conferred with sweeny

    only one thing to do they agreed
operations for the day were suspended
and the second warehouse was fitted with
coils of steam-pipe that maintained the
building at a uniform temperature of
one hundred and two degrees by em-
ploying outside help mcadams managed
to move the entire pack into the larger
warehouse within two days

    if they are going to spoil he con-
sidered  they might as well do it quick
before any of them are sold  and if just
a few more spoil we can get at em the
way they are now in the other house
a full half might have gone bad in the
middle of the pile without any one know-
ing a thing about it i guess that is a
good move

   his precaution however was need-
less for very few cans were afterward
found that had fermented and business
continued as before

   the heated warehouse began to be well
filled with the constant additions to the
pack and from chicago came favorable
reports from mr elwell concerning new
contracts for future deliveries of
canned eggs at night mcadams would
sit down with a pencil and paper fig-
uring the profits of each days work get-
ting results- paper-that satisfied
even his most sanguine expectations he
was not counting his chickens before they
were hatched exactly but-

  oh hopes that perish and dreams
that go astray but a short three weeks
elapsed until mcadams was again beset
with difficulties ushered in by a jobber
from san francisco who expressed a de-
sire to see some of the canned eggs in
contemplation of sales to be made to his
patrons

  the jobber accompanied mcadams to
the warehouse and mcadams proudly
pointed out to him the results of accom-
plished labor-a few hundred odd cans
over three hundred thousand of canned

egg-

  mcadams opened a can-one of the
cans that had been moved three weeks
before from the other warehouse

  from the can came an odor lie
looked-and looked again

  wildly he attacked another can-
again he looked the can dropped from
his palsied hand-

  the jobber stared wide-eyed for a
moment only and then fled shortly
after lie leaned limply against the bar
of the nearest thirst-emporium

   three fingers in a wash-tub lie
gasped to the amazed barkeeper  and
let it be something strong -ive had
a shock 

  mcadams delayed but a moment only
after tile departure of the jobber he
opened one more can but his hand trem-
bled and the contents were spilled on
the floor

  he looked at the litter-perhaps it
would be more veracious to say he stared
for something moved among the mess of
softened shells and that something-
cheeped

  in chicago the astonished elwell re-
ceived a telegram it read

    sell no more eggs and cancel con-
  tracts there are none to sell

                       mcadams

  elwell hurried to petaluma

  with an emotion that approached a
doubt of his own sanity he came to the
cannery that lie had seen completed so
short a time before a force of carpen-
ters were busy on the wide porch con-
structing boxes that no reach of the
imagination could construe into hack-
ing cases for canned eggs

  truck-load after truck-load of empty
cans were being wheeled down a gang-
way from the warehouse and dumped on
a mountainous heap of useless tinware
smoke still belched from the chimney
but there was no sound of machinery

  in strange contrast to the apparent
ruin mcadams met him at the door with
a smiling face
the petaluma product



   well you got back

    yes i have returned  but what does
 this mean is this a cannery or is it an
 incubator or is it a hospital for sick
 eggs this is information that i should
 like to obtain

   with a moving finger mcadams beck-
 oned him away to the warehouse there
 piled row  row to the ceiling with
 scarcely room for passage between were
 stacked the boxes made by the carpen-
 ters outside row on row of chicken-
 brooders filled with their rightful ten-
 ants

   ranged by a long bench worked forty
 men opening cans from the cans they
 extracted-the natural descendants of
 the egg mcadams waved his hand
 abroad  the whole building is like
 this he said

    i-i think-that i will lie down-
 if the office is clear groaned elwell
 and he instantly suited the action to the
 word

   mcadams sympathetically followed
 the manager to the office remembering
 his own emotions when first he had cog-
 nizance of the miracle

    can i get you a glass of water mr
 elwell   he asked

  water groaned elwell what
good is water when im totally and irre-
trievably ruined 

    guess again and guess better re-
 joined mcadams tapping the desk with
 a long forefinger  those little chick-
 ens mr elwell are at present worth
 seventy-five cents a dozen in the open
 market more later there are now one
 hundred and fifty thousand dozen and
 others coming that is not ruin quite
 that i can see 

   mr elwell began to recover

   a few months later the second and last
 session of the directors of the petaluma
 canning and packing company con-
 vened in the san francisco offices in
 this manner the treasurer summed up his
 report

   total disbursements from original
 capital of the company for construction
 of plant etc operating expenses etc
 secured by sale of company stock ail
 accounts receipted by check 

   total receipts of company from sale

   of plant to petaluma poultry com-
   pany sale of  dozen of small
   chicks and broilers at an average price
   of  per dozen sale of other acces-
   sories payment cash or negotiable pa-
   per 

     balance to be divided among stock-
   holders 

   rut notwithstanding this more than
favorable report-indisputable proof of
profits safely in hand-the petaluma
canning and packing company was im-
mediately dissolved by the unanimous
consent of the directors the reason
was tersely expressed by mr elwell at a
little dinner he gave that evening - a
wake in honor of the defunct corpora-
tion

    gentlemen said he  i have taken
part in movements of frenzied finance
before i have also been in a railroad
wreck but on neither occasion have i
been so near to total financial and bodily
annihilation as i was on the morning
that i saw chickens produced as a by-
product of canned eggs 

   mcadams alone of all the assembled
directors had a reasonable explanation to
offer

    a dog is a man said he  an you
can argue with a dog a horse is a man
an you can argue with a horse but a
hen is a woman an shell have her own
way in spite of all you can do eggs
are supposed to be either hatched or
eaten they are not supposed to be
canned an so they just naturally
hatched an then besides petaluma
was just naturally intended as a place
to raise poultry an i honestly believe
that youd get hens there by spontaneous
generation even if you killed every
chicken in the place

   this explanation he offered to sweeny
later

  huh said sweeny mebbe
youre right but i think it was the gas
ill bet a dozen eggs without any res-
ervation that the frenchman didnt use
patent gas

    perhaps said mcadams slowly

 he never did can eggs at all

   and mcadams is still wondering what
that mysterious frenchman would have
done had he found himself confronted
with the petaluma product
my lady of windmills

by edward marshall

 of a female don quixote who
 spent most of her time doing
 mountain-climbing on molehills

very lovely she was as she looked
at him although clearly her age
was nearly equal to his own

      she made him think of one of
those old flemish silver statuettes of
court ladies which the careful searcher
may still find and buy in antwerp she
smiled when he mentioned this

  emerging from his arms a moment
later she gazed at him fondly beaming
as even elderly affection may at its true
love and breathless her first words
were not however just what he had lis-
tened for

   at our age too  she said

   why not   he asked then he saw
something in her face which filled him
with mild apprehension

   marcella he said softly  dont
begin to worry about other people 
how well he knew her gentle fail-
ing he looked into her face with eyes
ashine with love vital despite the little
shadows which approaching age had
cast about them understanding and in-
dulgent

   if we have waited till youre forty
and im more the worse fools we said
he  and we must wait no longer

   if any living soul should suffer
through it she said slowly  would it
not be wrong for us to think of it
high-handed youth has passed for us
 but may we not together seek con-
tentment in the autumn of our lives
he replied  who possibly could suf-
fer through it

  then he spoke foolishly intending to
play lightly with a vague jealousy which
once had troubled him a little but now
since he had secured her promise had
vanished utterly

  are you thinking of the doctor
he merrily inquired in all sincerity he
believed that under the circumstances
the remark was mildly humorous

  instantly lie regretted the remark
and wondered at his great unwisdom in
suggesting difficulties to her

  she caught her breath as if he fum-
bled at a door she feared somewhat

  how could the doctor suffer she
demanded but with no note of confi-
dence then more surely - and this
pleased him  and  am very thank-
ful if he-we have been such friends
for years that-oh i could not bear to
give him pain  

  she paused and gazed unseeing into
the grates dull glow there was chill
in the spring air

   but he has never spoken she went
on  i have sometimes feared he
would but he has not i dont know-
if he did care-i think that i should
hesitate we could be very happy you
and i with friendship have we not
been if it would take unhappiness to
any one would we have the right to ask
of life the greater joy for the few years
that are left to us

  he laughed a little at this repetition
of her question but uneasily

   it wont take unhappiness to any
one he said in a tone which he was
hopeful might undo the mischief he had
done by bringing up the subject  and
of course we have the right

  her attitude frightened him a little
it was unusual for a woman who had
just acknowledged love and plighted
troth even if she were marcella had
he joking raised a bogy which had
really frightened her he knew her
deep capacity for sweet concern for
others

  if he had cared he would have
spoken he said weakly in an effort to
dispel the fantom he had materialized
from the vague vapox of her character-
istic questionings

 
my lady of windmills



  she nodded but half-heartedly it
was as if she tried to force conviction
of this logic  her mind

  he reviled himself why had he not
been satisfied with the rich goods pro-
vided by the gods and not-

   and there is bernard too said
she plainly now asearch for difficulties
 what will your son say

  now he laughed heartily that spec-
tral obstacle he could dispel he was
at ease again

  my lady of windmills he said
mockingly  rushing full tilt as always
at fantom adversaries bernard is just
eleven 

  she had smiled-with some abstrac-
tion but still otniled - when he had
called her my lady of windmills it
was a little joke between them she
knew herself that she was prone to see
the enemy where foeman there was none
but when he spoke so lightly of his sons
importance she grew grave again

   eleven - years - old can form strong
likes and dislikes she warned se-
riously

   as if he said quite gaily  a son
of mine could fail to fall in love with
you 

   i could not fail to love your son
said she with a rich smile for him
then almost appealingly she bent to-
ward him as if she begged him to say
pleasant things  do you think he
will she pleaded

   for his years said he  he has
good judgment

  with eyes fixed firmly on his face
she reached groping for his hand and
finding it she patted it but the sub-
ject did not leave her thoughts she
sat quiet plainly considering a woful
possibility

  in spite of her gray hair in some
things she was like a child he won-
der of a babe shone often from her wide-
open expectant eyes her mental habits
were unspoiled unhardened she spoke
with a sharp intake of the breath

   oh said she  if he should not
love me if he should be resentful
if he should not want me for his
mother 

   he will idolize you her com-
panion answered with a comforting
finality and idolizing you will beg

 you to advance the wedding date he
 laughed softly  dont be afraid to
 yield to him on my account 

   she did not permit herself more than
 a vague smile nor did she in contem-
 plation of the boy specter entirely aban-
 don consideration of the doctor as a
 fantom at their feast she now con-
 sidered both with a minute care in
 searching for unpleasant possibilities
 which he declared was dissipation

    you look for and absorb a worry
 he exclaimed  as might a hashish-
 eater seek and eat his drug it is a
 habit you might tell the doctor by the
 phone that you have thought of marry-
 ing me but will not if he has objec-
 tions  

   john said she

   but he did not wholly silence her
 with ridicule for as he rose to go she
 looked at him half-shamed and flushing
 delicately at the thought of renewing
 mention of misgiving and said in-
 quiringly 

   and bernard

    again   he asked and laughed
  bernard he said more seriously but
 still lightly  gets most of his opinions
 from his dad and really i think well
 of you i reckon hell agree with me

   but john she said i-why -i
 have never even seen him if we are
 to-marry-as soon as you get back
 from minnesota and if  am not to see
 him till then - dont you understand
 his new mother will be quite a stranger
 to him 

   by jove said he impressed by
 this  ill tell you what to do while
 im away if you can stand the noise
 why dont you have him come here sos
 to get acquainted with him

ii

   bernard had not been a lonely little
 boy really for he was fertile of re-
 sources but until recently no small lad
 had lived within companionable distance
 of his fathers place out in the country
 where he was much alone with servants
 and never having known his mother or
 had a brother or a sister he had been
 forced sometimes to turn to books for
 company

   one which he had found but recent-


the all-story magazine

 lv in the sunday-school library espe-
 cially held his interest for it recorded
 the many fascinating troubles in little
 arthurs life chief of these loomed
 up a stepmother married by his father
 when they were traveling abroad and
 superhuman in her cruelty

  reading he did not at first know
just what stepmothers might be but
finally considering her nationality he
placed them somewhat hazily in his
mind as bloodthirsty russian women
he made an obscure connection between
stepmothers and the steppes of bleak
siberia described in his geography
prone to destroy weak innocent young
boys this opinion like many of the
lonely little chaps had been achieved
and stored away without discussion with
any older person

  there came confirmation of it jim-
my arties father rented a near-by ten-
ant-house  the lads of course through
mere propinquity became fast friends
and mrs artie was a lithuanian easily
becoming russian to bernards mind
one day jim was plainly full of wo
bernard asked him why

  mom said jimmy who had not
had advantages  and did not always
speak correctly  last night she whaled
me

  ah she is a stepmother was ber-
nards instant comment

   um-huh said jimmy  how did
you know  

    guessed said bernard  does
she-

  he told of little arthur seeking
parallels

  oh worsen  that  said jimmy
with a certain sort of pride

  then he told his tale in full in a
corner of the fodder-barn where it was
shadowy and easy to work up strong
emotions it was really quite dreadful
and some of it quite true of this he
showed some horrid proofs when he
proudly took his shirt off and let ber-
nard wide - eyed and gasping look at
dark - blue markings saffron - edged and
eloquent of recent blows bernard pon-
dered much upon this shocking matter

  that night not six hours after his
father had conversed in the city twenty
miles away as recorded at the beginning
of this tale the small boy said to him

   it must be a nawful thing to have
a stepmother id hate it

  his startled father choked upon his
coffee and almost dropped the cup

   why did you say that he gasped
he had been about to break the charm-
ing news to him

   because- said bernard and he
told the tales of jimmy and of little
arthur

  his father gazed at him in sheer
astonishment

   heres a windmill of marcellas
he reflected  which is not entirely a
ghost 

  he had divers reasons for the course
he followed finally and he went ahead
on it convinced that he was quite con-
versant with the youngsters twisted
premises in real fact he did not sound
the depths of bernards inaccurate de-
ductions far enough to capture his asso-
ciation of stepmothers with the czars
dominions

  he did not really attach great im-
portance to the matter but still decided
that the way of wisdom would be to ar-
range things so that mother and son-
elect should meet and learn to love each
other ere the boy was told about the
marriage he did not break the charm-
ing news to bernard

  instead that night after the boy had
gone to bed he gave a long laborious
hour to writing a short letter he
warned himself while poised his pen
that while he must make things exactly
clear he must say no word which would
affright marcella she must know
about the complication but she must
not regard it as too formidable after
he had filled one sheet with explana-
tions he wrote in substance slowly

  the mere word terrifies him now but
  when he comes to know you he- per-
  haps you might invite him while i am
  away-

  then he let the letter lie upon his
desk and as he studied it he smiled
he saw a chance to make the thing
seem light and unimportant by teasing
her about the doctor again he failed
to take into consideration the essential
fact that she lacked certain details of
his masculine sense of humor again he
neglected to regard the fierceness of her
my lady of windmills



              feeling of responsibility to all other
              members ofthe human race he heed-
              lessly added

                  now dont make this excuse to- i
                 know that that confounded doctor-

              when he had her answer in a day
or two during which his business had
not permitted him to go to see her he
smiled again marcella ever had in
l	store some new surprise in this letter

              with inconsistency quite feminine she
              shifted her position

                now that she thought the father wor-
              ried about bernard she herself was full
              of confidence she wrote quite cheer-
              fully  and in spite of the amusement-
              fond but still amusement - which he
              felt as he perused her words they took
              genuine relief to him he would have
              been tremendously distressed if he had
              had to start upon his journey feeling
              that she was seriously disturbed

               her threats that she would never
             marry him if bernard did not change
             his false opinions about stepmothers
             did not worry him at all he knew
             bernard would change them as soon as
             he became acquainted with her

                after a sentence or two more of con-
              fident denials in regard to the doctor
              she added

                  i do wish however that you had
                never put the thought into my head
                you know how horribly i hate to grieve
                folk why did you am i not a cow-
                ard   enclose a note of invitation for
                bernard

                bernards father on the whole was
              not quite satisfied with the correspond-
              ence  is joking surely had miscar-
              ried  but there would be no time for
              explanations before he went away on
              his return if matters still were skewed
              he could soon straighten them that
              evening he gave the note of invitation
              t	to his son

                 my dfar bernard

                     i feel as if i know you very well be-
	cause your father is my close close

                 friend i have been wondering if you
                 would not come to stay wrth me while
                 lie is gone out west and even for a
                 time afler his return if i shall have
                 made it pleasant for you

     i am sometimes a little timid about
   staying here with just the servants if
   you can come i know that i shall feel
   and be much more comfortable and
   safe can you manage such a thing

  it was an effective letter that she
really needed him for strong protection
in her loneliness weighed mightily
with bernard

iii

  two mornings later she stood out in
her garden she had been setting tulip-
bulbs ihe spring air was very warm
and pleasant she joyed in mere exist-
ence

  no worry for the moment dimmed
her primitive gaiety she had thoughts
only for her flowers the postman
passed bernards reply to her across the
privet hedge

  she knew its source the moment she
espied the address in the cramped and
boyish script and tore it open eagerly
her heart quite pitapatted for she had
thought about the boy so much first as
one who might dislike her when he
found that she had stolen part of his
dear fathers heart from him and sec-
ond as another object around which the
tendrils of her love lain dormant all
these years and very eager very greedy
now that they had caught the gleam of
sunshine might twine

  an english garden-hat lawn-gar-
landed guarded her fine delicately
tinted face from the insistent kisses of
the youthful seasons ardent sun her
long slender-fingered hands were in
huge wristed gauntlets

  she drew these olf and dropped them
to the ground she wished to touch
the youngsters letter with bare fingers
this was a real desire and for a long
minute before she tore the envelope she
stood there pressing it between her
moist warm palms caressing it with
dainty finger-tips finally she read it

   it was a sturdy little letter full of a
boys conceit at thought of being her pro-
tector  and after she had read it slit-
gazed into the morning dreaming pleas-
antly of depths of rich affection which
she would draw on for the little chap
her fears were for the moment all for-
gotten discounted


the all-story magazine

  she who had so yearned for childish
love would soon have for her very own
the manly little author of this delightful
note gain his affection each word
which he had written whispered that he
waited only for the opportunity to love
her

  she had been asearch for fantom
foes she cheerfully admitted this and
smiled contentedly among her flowers be-
cause it was so she saw the doctor com-
ing down the street what a silly bug-
bear for example she had made of
nothing in believing that he even-

  his rumbling kindly voice greeted her
across the hedge grizzled gray he was
a brusk man big honest-eyed direct
older by ten years than bernards father
as she turned toward him charming
miss true flanders approaching from
the opposite direction waved her hand
to her

  returning the salutation miss mar-
cella had an opportunity before the
doctor had come through the gate and
reached her side to wonder why it was
that these two who had been friends for
years had never seen that they were ex-
actly fitted to each other

  why had the doctor always shown her
preference when miss flanders was
really so much better suited to become
his mate perhaps they would yet see
it then the worryings of her beloved
would cease she did not for an instant
doubt their reality now

   glad youre here marcella said the
doctor having reached her side and
speaking with a voice extraordinarily
soft for him  what i have to tell this
morning is better told among the flowers
ive been thinking that im getting old
and have been getting lonely almost
without knowing it i havent realized
how empty my life is i need some one
to-

  a bombshell burst within the central
stronghold of her group of spanish
castles she instantly divined she
thought just what the doctor planned to
say bernards father had been right
about him in the first place

  her recent comfortable reasoning had
been all false oh why at just this
moment had fate brought the doctor
with this revelation to her why even
if he loved her had he chosen now to

voice his love she was so fond of him
how could she endure to give him pain
he must not must not actually tfsk her
leaving him with his tongue poised for
the next and she was sure the fatal
word she fled

   he did not even guess her mental proc-
esses mouth slightly open handker-
chief midway between his coat-tail pocket
and his brow which he had planned to
wipe for the day warmed he stood there
staring after her then with a puzzled 
 she must have thought of something 
in his mind an explanation which he
knew to be inadequate but accepted
lacking better he turned back through
the gate climbed into his gig and gave
his horse the signal to amble on about
his rounds he chuckled

   what i had to say will keep he
thought  good things will always
keep ill get a chance to tell her in a
day or two

  just as he drove away again appeared
miss flanders it was almost as if she
had been waiting around the near-by
corner dark southern still vivacious
although also elderly she had the air of
youth now and as he checked his willing
horse ran toward him answering his
greeting smiles with others as delighted
plainly she approved of him this
morning

    did yo tell heh she inquired and
drawled the words delightfully as do
those who come from dixie in spite of
her plain eagerness

   i was about to said the doctor
 when she was called away i will
though if you still insist

   of cose ah still insist miss
flanders said  ah just cant speak of
it mahsef suppose she should be-
should be haht-broken  

 nonsense  said the doctor  but
all right ill get another chance or make
one within a day or two he raised
the reins again  good-by-my dear 
she flushed and smiled

   you-you ol dahlin  she ex-
claimed

  he drove on happy

  miss marcejla passed a miserable
afternoon and evening in her library
my lady of windmills



worrying each time a footstep sounded
from the street fearing it might be the
doctors and would pause turn in and
bring him to her bent upon a fuller state-
ment of his case he did not come how-
ever and when it was too late for him
shv felt a great relief

  but when she went to bed and her
mind turned to her other worry she
dreamed of bernard shrinking from her
horrified repelled later in her vision
the small boy struck his fathers hand
from hers as they were standing up be-
fore the clergyman at noon next day
she went to meet the youngster at the
railway station

  her emotions during the brief drive
were mixed she longed to see the lad
of whom her thoughts were full but also
feared to waiting at the station she
felt like a conspirator planning to rob a
baby of its fathers love

  then a figure in the distance made her
think about the doctor whom she had
striven to keep outside her thoughts this
morning she almost turned to run for
if he saw her meet the boy of course the
situation would be clear to him she
thought and his grief would instantly
begin

  the figure coming nearer proved to
be a strangers but the thought had
broken through her barriers against it
and she could not drive it out again she
had the miserable sense all up and down
her spine that he lurked behind her every-
where  her roving eyes expected sight of
him waiting to watch her with a tragic
gaze beyond each pillar she approached
on the long platform of the station

  at last the train came in and from the
few descending from the parlor-car she
had  trouble in selecting bernard
he did not look at her reproachfully but
shook hands gravely and said he hoped
her health was very good indeed she
loved him at first sight and hustled him
away as if she were a kidnaper

  and bernard in three minutes he
was spellbound

  he had never seen so many and such
pleasant shades of gray before and in his
mind he christened her the gray lady
her eyes were gray and sparkled her
hair was gray-a young gray if you know
what that means not somuch a badge
of years as-well some folks do not grow

old they just become mature additionally
lovable her gown was gray and looped
about her neck was fluffy gray stuff which
she did not value highly for in hugging
him she crushed it ruthlessly

  and he noted a strange thing some-
how a fellow did not feel ashamed when
she was hugging him bernard was sur-
prised by this such hugs and kisses as
had come to him from ladies whom he did
not know and poor little chap he had
known few in times gone past had been
embarrassing things to hurry through
with furtive glances at onlookers hers
did not steal his manhood

  he was himself astonished when as
soon as she had loosed him and he had
seen the look in her gray eyes he hugged
her back again then observing that the
gray stuff was once more being crushed
he suddenly relaxed his clasp she over-
joyed to have found him other than an
enemy and delighted beyond measure by
this first demonstrative greeting looked
upon him with a mock reproach which
was very near to actual disappointment
and said softly

   is that as well as you can hug 

  he mentioned the peril of the gray
stuff

   bother  she remarked  theres
more of that somewhere and theres only
one of you  hug me again

  she had  reason to complain about
the hug that followed enjoying it with
thrills of keen delight she forgot the doc-
tor while it lasted but just as they had
finished with it she really saw his gig
approaching slowly from the distance

  she popped bernard into her carriage
climbed after him with much more haste
than dignity and called directions to the
coachman which would take them home
by the long way and save them from a
meeting with the gig then for the
moment safe again she turned once more
to bernard with delight

  the feeling that in one sense she was
not quite frank because she did not
instantly announce child i am to be
your stepmother  oppressed her for a
time  but this passed

  how they did enjoy that drive it
seemed unnecessary for them to waste
time in getting acquainted it was as if
their friendship had begun when he was
born


the all-story magazine

   oh she reflected as his little paw
returned a pressure from her slender
taper-fingered hand from which the
glove had been removed he loves me
at first sight  within a quarter of an
hour she thought -  he will be happy
when he finds i am to be his step-
mother  

  his already very high opinion of her
rose even higher after they had left the
carriage and were standing on the lawn
at the side of her big house-square
brick and also gray-when she looked at
him and said

   i hope youre not a quiet boy

  this was her charming manner of tak-
ing the bull by its two horns his father
it will be remembered had warned her
on this subject really she was not a
worshiper of noise but-

   i can be quiet he replied

   dont dare to here  she cautioned

   id much rather not he made ad-
mission

   im glad said she  please let me
hear you yell

  he merely stood amazed

  cant you she curiously asked as
if she doubted his ability

   of course i can said he

  he looked at her obliquely wonder-
ing he knew quite well from things
which had been said to him from time
to time by others that when he really
yelled so that there was any fun in it
the noise was loud enough to split a
bodys ears exactly those words had
been used to him he essayed a timid
piping

   thats not a real boy-yell said she
 is it the best that you can do  she
spoke as if she had been disappointed

  no-um he admitted but your
head would ache

  sonny she replied the little rascal
had bewitched her no my heart
would ache if you were not a real true
boy 

  well it made him tickle-way in-
side somewhere - a yearning sort of
tickle but you cant describe those
things

  he yelled-yelled with a slow shrill
earnestness beginning with his lungs
packed full and ending with them so
empty that they fairly ached he neg-
lected no small art which careful study

of the process had revealed to him and
topped off with a sort of yodel created
by the plumping of his hollowed hand
against his mouth at intervals

  his proud mind heard a choctaw
war-whoop in the sound resulting pier-
cing ear-splitting nerve-racking it was
a masterpiece that yell was and he knew
it jim never could have come within
a mile of it he looked at the gray
lady fearful that she would show some
sign of great distress but for the
thoughts that she must make him long
to have her wed his father and that she
doubly wished to now that she had met
the son were stronger in her heart than
was the ringing in her ears she only
said

   thats very good indeed-the best
ive ever heard but this place is big
and empty and you must yell often if
you are to keep it full of boy-sound i
really must insist that you shall keep it
full of boy-sound maybe as you prac-
tise you can yell yet louder and with
more vim 

  he almost doubted that he heard
aright but stood there silenced unable
to make comment

  wont you yell again please she
implored with eager voice and eyes but
timid shrinking ears

  as he complied with this request there
came a look upon his face turned fully
toward her as he yelled which made her
feel as if life had given her a gift oh
how utterly mistaken had she at first
and then his father been she did not
mind the ringing in her ears she men-
tally assured herself that it was pleasant
some pains you know-

  happy hand in hand they went into
her house

  after dinner through the dusk as she
sat in the dim library with him they
held hands a good deal elation grew
in her

  bernard went to bed at half after
eight in the small room next to hers
both opened from the ground-floor hall
just opposite the two doors of the library
she sat down before her desk to write
about her undoubted triumph to ber-
nards father

  i shall only need to enter heartily
  into all his boyish interests and sports
my iady of windmills



  and show him that i love him-which i
  do already it will be what he would
  designate as  just as e-a-s-y    ith-
  in a day or two  stepmother  will be
  bis dearest word why-

  a murmur from the youngsters bed-
room interrupted her gould the little
chap be ill she went to him and
leaned above his bed no he was
merely tired and talking brokenly in his
sleep

  she bent close to his flushed face as
it lay upon the pillow with a plan for
softly kissing him awake at that in-
stant his confused articulations became
clearer and he said quite unmistakably
run jim oh run run a big
stepmothers after yeh  oh-oh-shell
get yeh-shell- 

  her face was twisted into a compli-
cated tangle of emotion signs as she
gently shook him back to consciousness
he turned lazily in bed stretched com-
fortably as the happy knowledge that
he had merely dreamed the horror came
to him smiled at her divinely softly
mistily and looked into her brooding
eyes confidingly

  i had a nawful dream he mur-
mured to her  dreadful thing was
chasing jim

  she sat there at his bedside wallow-
ing in a soft hash of thoughts until he
went to sleep again returning to the
library she regarded somewhat nloom-
ily the words which she had written

  she was dismayed still she would
not change a word upon that still ink-
damp sheet-no finally she added
though

    but even if it should not prove to be
  so easy im sure it can be done real
  love will win him over to our side

  here she paused for a few moments
the youngster thus disposed of there
were other things to write about and
what she wished to say concerning one
of them did not quite appear to jibe
with facts eventually however she
reached a point where she believed that
she had found that which she desired to
write and wrote it thus

   and as for what you say about the
  doctor-ive thought about that too t

  is absurd hes very fond of me of
  course but it is more a fathers fond-
  ness lie is fifteen years my senior
  and-

  a servant came to say that dr foster
had dropped in he often did when
returning from some sick-room he saw
her library still glowing if the door
had not been locked she would not have
had the warning he would have mere-
ly entered

  she talked to him in a sharp agony of
nervousness upon indifferent topics for a
few minutes what wo bernard had
already destroyed all her belief in easy
victory with him she actually prayed
that the second statement in that hope-
fully conceived letter might not also be
disproved  but noting with distress that
the doctor seemed to be ill at ease him-
self she felt small hope of this

  that bernard was in bed and sound
asleep was a relief to her she did not
wish to have the doctor learn just then
about his presence in her home should
he discover it the crisis would be instant-
ly precipitated she felt sure and she had
already suffered too much strain to make
it possible for her to meet a crisis well
then she comforted herself

  he could not learn of it unless she told
him he would scarcely dare to search
her bedrooms she assured herself of
this with sharp self-ridicule

  as he sat the doctor faced the back
wall of the low-ceiled dim delightful
room she sat so that she could get
what comfort she could find in brief oc-
casional glances through a window out
into the beauty of the night their con-
versation was a fencing bout

  suddenly he stopped short in the mid-
dle of a sentence with staring eyes
with one hand grasping each arm of his
chair with gasps he rigidly arose

   what in the world   he stammered
as if glimpsing ghosts

  she turned

  like a white canton-flanneled statuette
abashed to immobility because he saw a
stranger where he had thought she was
alone bernard gleamed there in the door-
way against the velvet blackness of the
hall beyond bad dreams again had
roused him

  the doctor-after she had gone to the


the all-story magazine

small boy administered some comfort in
the hall more in the bedroom where no
strangers eyes could see and come back
blushing furiously into the library-ex-
claimed 

  so jim martins son is staying here
jim marlins son  

  the trouble with the doctor was that
she could never feel quite certain that she
read his manner rightly now she
strove to do so but was baffled there
were always snorts in what the doctor
said

  there were those among his younger
patients who spoke of him in private as
the  war-horse were the sounds with
which he favored her to-night but efforts
to make lightly merry with her or had
they some deep inner meaning-of dis-
tress regret resentment 

  he did not enlighten her for a
time he sat there almost silent later
he showed a tendency to talk of old-time
happenings much as he had out in the
garden he spoke again of how the years
were passing over them was this the
beginning of a burst of sentiment she
asked herself and shuddered

  the situation frightened her and be-
ing indoors she had nowhere to run away
to then she had bolted from the gar-
den to the house but now at night it
would not do to flee from house to gar-
den she was certain of his plan saw
plainly just how he was leading up to it
no defense was open to her except mere
verbal battling at which she was far
from clever

  their talk became a fight in which
he strove to force some words upon her
ears and lie was much more skilled than
she in the use of weapons then available
realizing this she resorted to the tactics
of the desperate she would not let him
finish out a sentence twice again he
definitely declared that their lives were
slipping rapidly away

  each time she almost rudely went to
look out through a window when at
last he rose to go it was in the air that
that which he had come to say remained
unsaid that he was much annoyed that
she was on the verge of tears his last
words spoken at the door reverted to the
boy and the tone in which they rumbled
out from under his mustache was assured-
ly intensely vicious she reflected

   suspecting her love for the father he
detested the small boy she thought his
voice fairly made her tremble and she
could not break his sentence

    so jim martins son is staying here 
he said jim martins son oh-ho

   returning to her desk she slowly tore
into small pieces the letter she had writ-
ten then she prepared to go to bed

  the house was very quiet she knew

	other caller would appear that night
for it was nearly eleven oclock all the
servants were in bed

   the evening had been chill and in the
grate the embers of a fire were glowing
sometimes in such circumstances she un-
dressed there and wrapped warmly sat
dreaming by the hearth an hour this
she did to-night but of course they
were not placid dreams she dreamed

  the burden of such poor comfort as
she could find in them was that at least
by chumming with the boy she might
eventually - at some distant date - win
him what to do about the doctor
though she was powerless to decide

  oh she mourned did the gray lady
for the bereft old doctor had not all
her fears been justified and more for
the moment she achieved an almost pleas-
urable thrill from the reflection that ber-
nards father must admit that she was
right concerning him

  was she his lady of windmills
she fancied not this however was a
boomerang since their interests were mu-
tual how she sighed as she sat there
by the fire

v

  one of the things which she had
learned about her little guest was that he
loved to have a bowl of milk and plate
of bread waiting in his room for a last
lunch at bedtime and so of course he
had found them there that night after
he had learned that they would be there
he had pondered  the matter and
touched by this detailed thoughtfulness
had figured out the application of the
golden rule to it he had discussed
this admirable guide for conduct with her
during the afternoon and so just be-
fore his bedtime came had called upon
the cook and begged extra portions of his
evening favorites from her

  into the bowl of milk he had then
my lady of windmills



crumbled enough of the crisp bread to
brim it for he himself liked to have his
bread first well soaked up before he
tackled it the two slices which re-
mained he placed upon a plate for her
material for a second crumbling by that
days last fading light had he placed that
bowl and plate upon the floor beside her
bed to make a glad surprise for her

  he was so very fond of bread and milk
at night that he was certain she would be
as pleased as punch hours before she
sank down by the fire to dream to grieve
there in the library he had prepared this
feast for her

  until nearly midnight she sat musing
by the flickering fire finally finding
that her thoughts were leading nowhere
but were traveling small circles coming
ever back to the physicians preference-
the small boys prejudice - she herself
considered bed without turning on the
lights within her bedroom she stepped
confidently across the thick familiar
rugs and neared her massive four-post
couch

  bernard in the next room was dream-
ing very pleasantly when she plunged her
slim bare foot into the icy pulp which
he had mixed there in the bowl and
springing with amazing vigor out of this
tiny frigid foot - bath landed with the
other foot upon the plate of bread from
which wholly unexpected contact she re-
coiled so energetically and one - sidedly
that at length she quite collapsed upon
the floor

  her wild shrieks roused the boy and
instantly he thought of burglars the
thought frightened him but he knew
that all men must be brave and rescue
women when they are distressed so in
his flapping night-drawers he rushed to
succor her with a baseball-bat - a gift
from her-which chanced to be beside
his bed

  his face was very white his teeth were
chattering and the bat shook in his
hands-for he had never started out to
fight a burglar in all his life before-but
he stood by her very sturdily as the light
flared up and asked almost steadily

 where is he then he added
 ill fix him 

  she looked at him with wild strange
eyes for just a second and then thanked
him very prettily for his offer of protec-

tion and said hastily that nothing in the
world but womans silliness had caused
her fright-for she had caught a glimpse
of the real cause and with lightning-like
rapidity had figured out about what really
had happened

  not for the world would she have told
him she swore with solemn face that
she often had such turns when getting
into bed

  when just as she was saying this the
frightened servants flocked about the 
door having been wakened by her
shrieks and the thudding of her capers
she waved them off without an explana-
tion she reflected as she said and did
these things that nothing in her lifes
experience had required such frequent
exhibitions of self-mastery made such
demand for lies as did this effort to
prepare the road to matrimony

   and-and thank you so much for
thinking of the bread and-i am afraid
that in my fright i have upset the
bowl  she said to bernard

  she still gasped at intervals

   i shall feel quite safe hereafter
with you near she added hastily

  her praise made him feel almost
grown-up

  then she grasped him in her arms
and pulled him close her loose sleeves
fell back so that she clasped him with
bare arms and he could feel her heart
beat as she sat upon the bed-edge and
held him

  as she pressed his yielding little body
tight instinctive mother-love welled up
in her strongly and as he answered her
caresses child - love thrilled in him
until he lay there happily the quick
breathing of his conquered terror ceas-
ing  and yearning deep affection for her
occupying all his thoughts

  for a moment they remained thus

  wouldnt you like to have a
mother bernard   she said pleadingly

   if only i could have he said no
less intensely

  she smiled ecstatically in the very
moment when she had thought about de-
feat here victory came through the
sweet agency of this fine emotion

  within two seconds she was looking
forward in exquisite reverie to years of
nurturing care for this delightful young-
ster then he said with a small sigh


the all-story magazine

   having mothers must be awful
splendid ive read lots about it its
as nice i guess as having step-ones is
disgreeable

  she herself sighed now her eyes
filled slowly there was pathos in the
little chaps position in the world she
told herself

  she took him to his room and waited
while he fell once more into a refreshing
slumber

vi	

  in the morning she was quite de-
pressed when she woke up but lying
there in bed she argued with herself
until she had concluded that at least
her worries of the night before about
the doctor had been perhaps unjus-
tified

  deep within her heart lurked contra-
diction of this comfortable thought but
she would not admit it to her mind
also she fought against consideration
of bernards views on stepmothers
fatuously she argued that when first
expressed they had been but vaporings
of a nightmare and dreams always went
by contraries that when he had voiced
them for the second time when he was
wide-awake he had not thought about
her personally in connection with his
ready condemnation

  thus fighting for a glimpse at the
bright side she finally convinced herself
that there was one

  when she swept into the small boys
bedroom to arouse him she was full of
confidence and lo as he awoke her con-
fidence became conviction for he looked
up at her bright-eyed and smiling all
happiness fresh affection welcome

  volatile wishing to be reassured she
joyed as she sat opposite the handsome
gentle-mannered little lad at breakfast
she crunched her toast believing that
the problem providence had given her
to solve was after all absurdly simple

  she put the night aside with resolu-
tion what a gay to-day theyd have-
she and the small boy what pleased
him should be her pleasure what inter-
ested him should absorb her thoughts
they would be comrades

  no that was not expressive quite-
they would be chums she would join

him at his games as well as share his
quiet hours so far as possible she
would transform herself into his men-
tal twin love and sympathy would
surely conquer him

  alas for the gray lady she did
not know small boys nor had she read
the hint concealed in the great yell
first ceremony of his visit trium-
phantly this morning she pointed to a
pile of packages fresh wrapped from
the stores

  what wealth of games was there
checkers chess parchesi and half a
dozen other boards with sundry pack-
ages of wondrous cards designed to
cheat the young into welcoming with
laughter gulps of sugar-coated knowl-
edge about authors trees birds ani-
mals he looked at all these things
with interest which she tried not to see
was quite perfunctory he praised them
with enthusiasm which she strove to
think was not politeness but still his
eyes as she gazed at them anxiously
assuredly were lacking in that bright
glad light which she had told herself
would shine in them when first their
glances fell upon these treasures

  with a strangely solemn mien made
almost pitiful by forced smiles he
played a game or two with her - and
then asked her to be certain not to let
his presence interfere with any of her
ordinary plans she was much disap-
pointed but tried bravely not to show it

  she wofully admitted to herself that
he was bored this would not do she
told herself if she would win him over
how could she interest him a dread-
ful thought was growing in her mind
that she must romp but she was game

   yes she said deriding her own
carefully planned schemes when the con-
viction had struck home to her that they
were failures  these games are good
enough  but after all theyre not real
fun are they

   theyre very nice he said politely

	 but dont you think said she  that
they are just a little stupid one has to
sit so still at games of this sort

   perhaps theyre not so full of fun
as indians said he  i mean as play-
ing massacre and scalping enemies but
here in the city perhaps wed better not
play indians i know a lively way to
my lady of windmills

-

scalp you though it almost never
hurts

   often when ive scalped jim hes
told me afterward that hes yelled just
sos to be polite that really i didnt
even pull but if you should put a
feather-duster handle down your back
and run around outside and war-
whoop folks going by would stare as
like as not

   im just a bit afraid they might
said she but there must be some
pleasant game which wouldnt be so-
so noticeable cant you think of any
thats one reason dont forget why i
wished you so to come its so hard for
women all alone to find amusements

  for a speculative second he looked at
her and hesitated would the proposi-
tion which he had in mind find favor in
her eyes finally he ventured it

  the moment he had entered her house
first the opportunity for the sport had
caught his eye the ground floor was
divided into even quarters by two halls
which crossed it at right angles like the
marks you make in tit-tat-to he men-
tioned the fine floors of these broad dig-
nified old passages

   my  said he  theyre just like
ice 

  that gave her the suggestion as he
had thought it would

   i wonder she said bravely al-
though those floors were as the apples
of her eyes and lo many serving-maids
had been driven from her house for
having marred their polish if one
could slide on them try it 

  it will be noted that she really
wished him to be happy with her really
wished to wed his father

  he looked at her uncertainly he
knew from more than one authority
that sliding in the house would be very
much too noisy he mentioned this to
her but after conquering a brief sec-
ond of very great relief she derided the
idea

   why i should like the noise and i
am very certain it wouldnt hurt the
floors she said mendaciously

  but as he moved to get a good long
start the peril of the polish overcame
her and she clutched him anxiously
very quickly though remembering -she
whispered to him with the air of a con-

    	s

spirator just as jimmy artie always
whispered when they were playing pi-
rates and an imaginary merchant vessel
appeared upon the fancied horizon

   take off your shoes and slide in
just your stocking-feet 

and those floors were just like ice
he begged her to participate in this
amusement she gasped but then re-
membering she said with heart aquiver
 you see how i have needed to have
a boy about 

  he knelt down and took her shoes off
and she slid she admitted to herself
as soon as the first terror of a tumble
passed that it was fun for she slid nice-
ly what charm there was in chumming
with a child

  fears and years were falling from
her even as the hairpins from her hair
and then upon a later trial something
other than the fears and years began to
fall-and finished falling the whole
world seemed to tilt-then bump

  instantly the boy gave gift of good
advice

   wink fast said he  and grip un-
til your nails bite in

  why she asked pathetically as
she sat upon the ice

   itll help you not to holler he re-
plied

   it does help she admitted after
trying it

  suddenly she was impelled to whirl
for a gruff voice said behind her

   perhaps id better bring some lini-
ment i have some in the gig

  the doctor stood there in the open
doorway observing the performance
gravely his mouth was firmly set in
a thin line which made his bristling
mustache form a thatch above his lower
beard there were strange glitters in
his eyps

  anxiously she tried as she sat upon
the floor to find interpretation of his
utterly immobile face finally she read
reproach in it and -for the boy she
thought she saw aversion there he
did not even look at him

  she did not stop to think that really
she formed in that unconventional posi-
tion a sight designed to quite monopo-
lize attention she did not answer him
with words but her fine face replied
with surges of rich color she made no


the all-story magazine

effort to get up confusion bound her
limbs

   marcella thedoctor said to her at
last-and as he spoke she thought she
saw the lighting of his eyes change soft-
ly to a soft rich glow to her not less
than terrifying- id like to speak to
you alone for a few moments

  then there came a twinkle to his eyes
which she resented although her fears
were quite too great to let her think
about that much  shall we he con-
tinued  step into your library or shall
i join you on the floor

  she shrank into a huddled heap
despairing not even noticing the fine
sarcasm of his last suggestion

  as she held nervously to bernards
outstretched hand - the doctor did not
even offer to help her to get up-the
door-gong at the other end of the long
hall boomed in soft rich reverberation
she scrambled bernard tugged she
rose

   in just a moment doctor let me
see first who is at the door said she

  the doctor said he much regretted
that a caller should have come to inter-
rupt them but he did not use those
words and stopped strangely in the
midst of his remarks upon the subject
when he saw who the caller was

   you-all must be a-na-a-appin
came in the charming softly southern
drawl of miss prue flanders as the
door was opened

  and when she really entered the doc-
tor was no longer there having made
his exit through the garden-door

 that evening the gray lady and
bernard tarried in the library a room
so aptly lighted that- while its tables
were quite flooded with soft radiance
for reading when one wished to read
it still held charming shadows placid
and encouraging to thought

  she needed outer shadows for her
thoughts that night for through them
rioted an inner glare of auto-accusa-
tion bright merciless and painful
bernard for the time was quite for-
gotten the doctors sad accusing
eyes photographed upon her thoughts
peered at her continually

  what right had she what right
why had her pleasant friendship for

john martin deepened into love why
could they be satisfied no longer with
it as it had been why did her strong
awakened soul and his cry out so
irresistibly for marriage it would
break the doctors heart she moved
uneasily among many cushions she
favored softly cushioned chairs that
evening for perfectly good reasons
why-

   its very pleasant here with you
remarked the boy

  her mind now left the doctor and
twined itself around bernard and as
she looked at him she could not quite
believe she was not making headway
with him

  how she longed for him almost
she cried within her soul that she cared
more to have him for her little son than
she cared to be his fathers wife she
wholly realized too that while her
heart might conceivably lead her to
forego her marriage to save the boy
from pain  consideration for the doc-
tor abode in it intense enough to make
her willing to deny herself the joy of
a vicarious motherhood to bernard

   but she reflected  if when i am
married to his father bernard shrinks
from me and is afraid my heart will
simply break 

  she inquired if he would much ob-
ject to kisses sometimes when there
might be apparently  especial reason
for them

   i mean quite often she continued
 not just when we part and meet and
things like that

   i should hate it with most folks
he said with earnest honesty  but you
may if you like when were alone

  so affectionate he was and quite
plainly much in love with her the
little episode consoled her wonderfully
even more volatile than usual because
of its prolonged disturbance her mind
for a moment now entirely forgot about
the doctors big grieved eyes she re-
membered them as mirroring deep grief
she gave rein to the conviction that 
lad of tender years like him bernard
could have achieved a prejudice so
strong that such love as he had plainly
formed for her would be too weak to
best it

  she filled her eager arms with him
my lady of windmills	

and held him light against her breast
emotionally he pressed his cheek into
the hollow of her neck lwlow her
thrilled and happy ear 

  ah she saw quite plainly that his
prejudice could not be strong enough to
nullify such love at last she felt quite
certain that all that she need do was
to declare her wishes to him imbued
with such a love for her he would right
happily hail news that she and his dear
father were to join in holy matrimony

  she had conquered him as she
reached this fine conclusion he made
further comment

    yes he said  its very nice when
were alone like this mrs artie never
kisses jim when theyre alone he says
but shes just always at it when theyre
out among folks but then shes a
stepmother it makes it awful for him
dont you think so

  it was like a dash of icy water on a
sleepers face

	she tried to bring herself to argue
with him to explain that stepmothers
might differ she tried to tell him that
she wished to be his stepmother but
she deferred announcement of these glad
glad tidings once again

  she hugged him tightly what if
learning of her perfidy he should wish
to leave her arms she shuddered and
he asked her why

   i think its just because i am so
fond of you said she

   how-how different you are from
a stepmother  he remarked and snug-
gled

  after that of course she could not
speak a great bewildering fear began
to grow in her that she ought to give
his father up

  anxiously she put queries to herself
was not bernards prejudice too strong
to ever down had it not become a
superstition 

  one who reads in history as she did
of winter evenings knows that super-
stitions do not die in individuals they
may die with generations but he who
once believes inghosts will shudder at
ghost stories as long as he may live no
matter how complete may be his proofs
that ghosts are fictional was not the
boys conviction that stepmothers were
vicious of this sort

  could he ever let come what days of
happiness and love might be purged of
it clearly it would shock him inex-
pressibly to find that she who had un-
doubtedly found place within his heart
had crept there like a thief at night to
rob would it not be wiser for her and
her beloved-make no mistake about
her love for bernards father it was
not less real because it came near sun-
set-to regard this and make sacrifice
to it

  her arms tightened about the lad
how relaxed his little body was
what an attitude of trust dependence
it had fallen into

  why he was asleep she turned his
face up gently with her long soft hand
without awaking him and looked down
at him soft hair in little curls cling-
ing to a dampened forehead sturdy
eyebrows thick bold-she could see his
father in those eyebrows eyelids droop-
ing calmly peacefully delicate fine-
veined

  how his lips had parted revealing
strong little teeth in just the-semblance
of a smile placid brow serene con-
tented and sheltering perhaps sweet
dreams of her not as a stepmother but
as a beloved friend could she deceive
him no

   with infinite care she bore him to the
cushioned couch arranging his limp
limbs there comfortably noiselessly
she closed a window so that no draft
might touch him then she softly
spread a silken coverlet over him with
light caressing touches and moved away
on tiptoe

  she was determined now the
morning of his life should not be
dimmed by even the shadow of a hor-
rible mistaken dream she sat down
at her desk and wrote of this decision
to his father proposing that although
she could not marry him as she had
promised to he share his boy with her
she traced slowly and with a feeling
that this was a very generous proposition
these words

    you may have him in vacations and
  i will have him for the school months
  there are more school advantages here
  in the city even if your country home
  is lovely it is with a dreadful pain that
  i renounce our dear dear dreams but


the all-story magazine

  it is best for him we of all the
  world-we who lcve him so-must not
  embitter him

  and more of the same sort

  she tried to picture in her mind the
look of bernards father when he read
that letter but she could not at first
then as the vision slowly came she
stopped trying for even with her minds
eye she disliked to see unpleasant sights

  she put the letter in an envelope
sealed stamped addressed it then she
found a summer wrap and gathered it
about her shoulders after that she
went as far as the front gate deter-
mined to drop the letter into the post-
box

  at the gate she turned and looked
back through the softly lighted window
of the room which she had left some-
thing had disturbed the boy and he was
standing there in the dim glow trailing
his coverlet behind him as the priests of
old trailed their robes

  she did not wish to have him find
himself alone and be affrighted she
hurried back to him with the unmailed
letter in her hand

vii

  dawn found her weary from an al-
most sleepless night the daylight
brought cat-naps to her as the hour for
rising will to most of us when she
finally rose bernard had been given his
breakfast by the servants and was stroll-
ing about the lawn demurely she
watched him from her window he
was far distant from the house but
more than onee she saw him glance to-
ward it apprehensively and then go far-
ther from it walking on tiptoe

   dear little chap he is afraid of
waking me she rightly thought

  this sign of his affection almost over-
came her for her mental state was some-
what flabby tears welled into her eyes
and softened even their soft gray as
feathery mists will dim but not entire-
ly obscure the soft scotch sunshines
golden gleam she looked at the letter
now lying on the table by her bed and
dolorously sighed

   i must get it to the mail before i
tear it up she told herself

  but lunch-time came along and found
it still reposing on her desk and with
the end of luncheon came the doctor
bernard to the hostesss relief was out
of doors again

  almost immediately after he had en-
tered the doctor brought confusion to
her by remarking that he had been care-
ful to announce his coming fearing that
if he did not he might intrude when
she was on the floor or something

   since that boy has been here he
said grumblingly  i should not be sur-
prised if i should find you turning
handsprings on the roof jim martins
son  o-ho  

   she was dreadfully confused

   but i must waste no time on him
he went on briskly  i have better
things to talk about the other day i
tried to tell you and was interrupted
that has happened twice in fact to-
day i really must get it off my mind
you and i marcella have known each
other all your life and say two-thirds
of mine it was three months ago that
i first became quite certain of my feel-
ings and i ought to have explained
them to you then but-

  she was in an agony wondering how
she could once more stem the current
of his declaration her hands twitched
in her lap and so keen was her distress
at thought of letting him speak on and
force the inevitably painful explanation
on her that her lips were all a tremble
ah how woful it all was

  oh why had this beloved friend let
the calm and fatherly affection which
had been so dear to her and which she
had returned with a daughters fond re-
gard change into more demanding love
she wished to jump up from the chair
and run but could not

  once she had fled from him-twice
she must not do it oh why was this
task thrust upon her why-

  she sat and prayed as if in answer
sent from heaven direct came the door-
gongs soft dull boom

    confound that bell  remarked the
doctor

  hasnt it the richest tone she
cried  have i ever told you it was
made in india 

   he looked at her astonished

  dont i know that he asked
my lady of windmills



complainingly and wonderingly  i
bought it in bombay and brought it to
you 

  she was confused

   why so you did said she and
hurried to the door determined to be
under way before the servant came to
open it

  miss prue flanders was again the
caller and was much astonished when
her hostess threw her arms about her
neck and kissed her such was not the
usual manner of the gray lady

  while she lavished kisses upon ber-
nard she was not at all the sort which
casts them unasked at the lips of wom-
en friends miss flanders though was
much delighted by this fine mark of
affection and returned it with enthu-
siasm

  the gray lady was astonished as she
saw what seemed to her to be quick
understanding glances pass between the
doctor and miss flanders as she ush-
ered her into the library could it be
that they two were in league

  almost immediately this suspicion
was confirmed and startlinglv by miss
flanderss soft rich drawling question
worded carelessly as everything she said
was as she found a seat and gracefully
sank into it

   well docteh have yo spoken out
yo little piece yet  

  the doctors answer almost was ex-
plosive

  no i havent he declared

  merrily miss flanders laughed as his
broad back disappeared at once without
a word of courteous farewell

  almost always in the past when she
had laughed like that in that house her
hostess had laughed with her for miss
flanderss was a most contagious gur-
gle such as is born only in those native
to the region southward of the vanished
line but this day the lady of the house
was far too worried to find any laugh
contagious

  what did the doctor mean what
did you mean she cried

  miss inlanders kept on laughing

   ah have told him she replied at
last  that ah would neveh tell yo an
all woant ah have said lie must he
must 

  this revealed a brand-new phase of

character in the doctor the gray lady
reflected why should he have tried to
get another to express his love for her

  then she considered that the vaga-
ries of bashfulness as inspired by love
are many and are sometimes inex-
plicable but if the doctor had con-
fided in miss flanders should not she
do so also thus some end of the
dilemma might be reached she began
an explanation it was difficult to do
so because miss flanders from her girl-
hood had been inclined to take things
lightly but the necessity for help from
some one was so great that the gray
lady overlooked this fact and went
ahead having finished she turned to
her companion with appeal

  she found a look upon her face so
different from any she had ever seen
there in her life before that she was al-
most startled by it miss flanders
seemed to be disposed to swallow some-
thing very much too large to swallow
and to be choking  it believing this
to be a sign of pending tears the gray
lady was alarmed

  what is it dear said she she
added timidly somewhat startled by the
thought which that very moment came
to her for the first time   you-you
are not-have not-oil my dear dont
say that voure in love with bernards
father too

  if that complication had occurred
then must she just give up she never
could endure to wreck another life

    oh no miss flanders said at last
 alim-ahm thinkin of the docteh

   will it - will it grieve him very
much  

  miss flanderss face was turned away

   ah reckon she began speaking a
little indistinctly  that he-he told me
he had tried repeatedly to speak to yo
alone but that you faihly struggled to
avoid him an ah doubted him 

  oh he did said the gray lady

   miss flanders was still quite plainly
struggling with some great unnamed
emotion  so-so he has neveh made
a declaation   she inquired

   no said the gray lady ihave
prevented that

    lets-lets take a walk an-an-
an talk it oveh said miss flanders
steadying her voice


the all-story magazine

  the gray lady was relieved by this
suggestion her heart was very sore
indeed at thought of all the sorrow
which her love-affair had given rise to

  on the walk however miss flanders
seemed to quite recover her good spirits
and encouraged her to talk the gray
lady told her absolutely all-more de-
tails of her fears about the doctor
first then of her efforts to convert ber-
nard by chumming with him she even
told about the great slide in the hall
and about the bread and milk

   ah heard aboot the slahd miss
flanders said

   who in the world- began the
gray lady

   the docteh mentioned it miss
flanders said  he said yo seemed to
be uneasy-like when yo were sittin on
the flo

  if only the gray lady said the
doctor had fallen into love with you 
 y-e-s said miss flanders  if he
only h-a-d 

  her companion looked at her sur-
prised  you dont mean- she ex-
claimed and stopped

   y-e-s said miss flanders appar-
ently not abashed by her confession but
breathing perhaps a trifle harder than
at ordinary times  ahve been in love
with him fo yeahs

   oh   said the gray lady  oh
you poor poor thing 

   ah dont mind a bit miss flan-
ders said

   you dont mind  said the gray
lady incredulously

  no ah dont replied miss flan-
ders  ah dont mind ah want him
to be happy allll tell yo what ah
think macella if ah weh you ah
wouldnt may him if yo ah really in
love with behnahds fatheh why-

   an the doctor never really has
asked me said the gray lady

   y-e-s said miss flanders  that
is anothch reason that is a splendid
reason then she changed the sub-
ject  but behnahd is a difent prob-
lem isnt lie

   it is so unfortunate said the gray
lady  i thought that if i chummed
with him-

  yes said miss flanders ah
should have thought so too

  the gray lady laughed a little sorrily

   his father doesnt understand said
she  he thinks that i imagine difficul-
ties you seem to realize

   ah think ah do a little said miss
flanders  what is it that he called
yo  

   his-his lady of windmills  said
the gray lady in a tone which begged
for sympathy

  how-insultin said miss flan-
ders  how insultin in the suhcum-
stances 

  the gray lady who during her re-
cital had been very near to tears looked
up a little comforted

   an so yo have been chummin right
along with behnahd said miss flan-
ders encouraging further speech

   i have been trying to

   wheah is he now  

   in-in the carriage-house i think
said the gray lady her mind whirling
her heart beating very rapidly in the pres-
ence of such great unselfishness her eyes
fixed upon miss flanders with a new
admiring look in them  oh my dear
my dear  she said to her

   dont mind me miss flanders an-
swered bravely  lets go an find that
boy ah want to have a good look at
a child with such detehmination ah
havent really noticed him befo

   how could you see him without no-
ticing him

   he really is the one you love  miss
flanders said

   oh i love them both-i love them
both   said the gray lady

viii

  the carriage-house had become quick-
ly when he was not with his hostess ber-
nards favorite retreat about the place
for reasons which its owner had not
guessed really he had found it quite
a treasure - place of interesting objects
best of all its fascinating contents was
a round rod of hickory extending be-
tween two upright beams just where a
little jump would let him grip it nicely

  it had been a pitchfork handle once
and then a rack for hanging harness on
and was highly polished

  what an aid to acrobatics the first
time he observed it he jumped for it im-
my lady of windmills



mediately if you have ever been a boy
you know what lie did then and you
know how he did it he skinned the cat
of course

  there is nothing which can give a boy
more pleasure than this eccentric evolu-
tion which is a revolution too and
this day the moment he had gone into
the carriage-house he had firmly grasped
the bar and arranged his body in that
ecstatic position which comes just as one
has thrust his legs up straight so that
if he bend them the knees will hook
across the bar you know or if he curls
them down and in a certain other way
they will pass through descend and he
will land upon his feet again after a
delightful twist of both his shoulder-
joints

  it is great bernard paused while at
the trick and hung there upside down
he laughed aloud in pure boy joy

  then he thought he heard a call and
as he listened waiting for a repetition of
it knew that skirted creatures were at
the buildings outer door he dropped
entered the gray lady and miss flan-
ders

    oh here you are  said his divinity
and smiled although the tears were very
near her eyes

   that pole said he in explanation
of his presence there  is great to skin
the cat on

   for an instant horror showed upon her
face

    oh   she said  oh where is the
poor poor creature  

   miss flanders also made distress signs
 did yo skin the cat alive yo hoid lit-
tle boy  said she

    it isnt real cats he replied polite
despite her vehemence  its athuletics

   i dont know what you mean  ex-
claimed the gray lady relieved but
i was sureyou couldnt be so cruel as
to-

    ill show you he said gravely  its
nothing you could do you know but its
great to hang with your head down and
see the whole thing upside down and
then go through between your legs and
see it in a frame 

   oth ladies showed signs of surprise

   really  said the gray lady  do
you find it interesting but what-oh
bernard you will hurt yourself

  he had assumed the posture he had
just referred to

    why its just as e-a-s-y  he ex-
claimed  ive never fell

   he completed the turn slowly repeat-
ed it with speed

   it was plain that as he turned an idea
seized upon miss flanders at first she
flushed  then almost she paled then
with that same peculiar choking mani-
festation which she had before exhibited
during the progress of this call she gave
voice to the idea

    yo know said she in an aside to
the gray lady  yo said yo planned to
enteh into all his spots an pastimes 

   at first her hostess did not catch her
meaning quite she had it in a moment
though and turned upon miss flanders
a wildly startled glance

   a vivid sparkle in miss flanderss eyes
replied to this and for the first time
since the visitor had come the worried
look quite vanished from the face of the
gray lady instead there grew upon
it an expression gay and girlish chal-
lenging for the moment she was her
old self again

    will you if i will she demanded
she seemed to snatch at gaiety as if she
needed it

  miss flanderss voice was heard in
skeptic laughter the gray lady turned
to bernard

    bernard she said softly  will you
please go in to cook and say-

   dont you let heh fool yo beh-
nahd said miss flanders  she is
only-

   if you really want to skin the cat
said bernard gravely  i had better stay
and show you how

  the gray tady shook her head with
smiles it was probably the desperation
of a sense of great defeat which made her
ready for this reckless project

   bernard politely stepped outside and
closed the door behind him

    arent we silly  said the volatile
gray lady  but when his father
comes to-morrow i must confess that i
am-beaten it relieves me to be fool-
ish

    it may also kill yo to be foolish-
this way said miss flanders an me
too but  neveh take a daeli do you
daeh me 
	the all-story magazine

   yes i do  said the gray lady

  bernard in the meantime greatly
puzzled because he had been sent outside
walked up and down before the carriage-
house he had taken quite a few turns
on this short patrol when he was tremen-
dously delighted to see his father coming
through the gate a full day ahead of
time

  he started toward him then as his
father turned between the posts the boy
saw that walking with him was the doc-
tor his fathers form at first had hid-
den him bernard was almost incensed
that doctor was always turning up at
inconvenient times still as he had not
seen his father for a long time he ran to
greet him

   where is she asked his fathiy re-
ferring to the gray lady after he had
greeted bernard with enthusiasm

  bernard rather hated to explain things
before the doctor-still it was an inno-
cent amusement she had taken up he
answered

   skinning the cat there in the car-
riage-house miss flanders dared her to

  his father looked at him aghast and
unbelieving the doctor at the mention
of miss flanders as her associate in this
brisk sport apparently sustained some
shock

  what they said in chorus as if
they had been trained

  suddenly shrill shrieks rushed through
the indicated buildings tight-shut doors
two excited female voices blended in
them and they held dismay distress a
plea for help forward flew the three
with bernard in advance

  he pushed the door wide open without
ceremony and within upon the floor
sitting quite as she had landed when her
grasp upon the pole had given way was
the gray lady leaning up against the
wall was miss prue flanders very slant-
ing intent alternately upon the nursing
of a knee and ridicule of her distressed
companion

  to her the doctor hastened anxious
bernards father hurried to the gray
lady nor did he merely help her up
he took her in his arms and kissed her
many times

   prue are you injured  said the doc-
tor in a voice ashake with great anxiety
while this was going on

   mali pride and a few otheh little
things of mine ah bruised a little said
miss flanders  but ah reckon its not

seious

  then the doctor observing the pro-
ceedings of the other two kissed her

  bernard gazed aghast miss flan-
ders made wild protest

   ahthuh  ahthuh   she exclaimed
 you stop they dont know a wolid
about it 

   martin knows the doctor answered
indicating bernards father  and if she
does not its her own fault he point-
ed to the gray lady  ive been trying
for some time to tell her but shes al-
ways cut me short

  bernards father still supported the
gray lady she needed his sustaining
strength for she hung across his arms
quite limp but paid no heed to him
whatever all her attention was concen-
trated  the other two and as she
gazed her lower jaw hung loosely

   wha-wha- was all she said

  she could not in her then existing
mental state add the  t  required to
make a word of the remark

   yes said the doctor turning a
flushed face in her direction  i have
been trying to tell you prue here be-
lieved - why she believed you were in
love with me and made me promise i
would break tie dreadful news to you
myself between you women ive been
harried near to death

   ah didnt think so said miss flan-
ders who was quite as merciless with
him as he had been with the gray lady
she took from life what enjoyment might
be found in it miss flanders did  yo
yosehf believed she was yo said so
yo believed yo said that that was what
it was that made heh act so afteh that
i said that it would be but the cose of
honeh fo vo to-

   he believed-you thought- stam-
mered the gray lady turning back and
forth - she did not have to turn far
either-from the doctors eyes to those
of miss prue flanders fiercely blushing
 why-why-why-

   well prue led me on  exclaimed
the doctor

   all had to said miss flanders
 yo weh so conceited fo yo to be
taken down was iicccssay
my lady of windmills



   you shut me up in some way said
the doctor continuing to address the
gray lady  every time

  ah know why miss flanders
chuckled  ah know why ah know
she told me

  quite a dreadful glare she had from
the gray lady then

   prudence flanders said the latter
 if you once dare to say another word
why-why-i never dreamed  

  soft derisive laughter was her an-
swer hut miss flanders did not tell

  suddenly the eyes of the gray lady
swung and caught a glimpse of bernard
for the instant he had been forgotten
she looked at him appalled and for
the first time since they had enclosed her
she straightened wholly from his fathers
arms

   oh bernard  bernard   she cried
quite fearfully would he turn away
from her with scorn and loathing now
that he had learned the truth  -

   better come and kiss your going-to-
be mother bernard said his father
showing no diplomacy whatever and pay-
ing  attention to him after that in-
stead he turned to the two ladies and
remarked

   doc and i ran into one another near
the station and weve got a plan fixed
up if you girls agree to it he wants
to go abroad to a convention of saw-
bones and our scheme is to be married-

all of us-at once and make a wedding-
trip of it

   bernard is at just about the age too
when he ought to have his first big look-
around it will sort of fix a basis for
his future understanding of the world
what do you think marcella

  but she had no eyes or ears for him
just then they were all intent with
fearful interest upon the boy for a
moment listening he had stood quite
dazed then he went to her and put his
hand out gravely

   i am very glad he said and plainly
meant it

  she looked at him bewildered

   but ill be your stepmother said
she anxious that he should not come to
her without a clear understanding of
their position

   oh said bernard  that wont mat-
ter in the least youll be quite difrent
youre not a russian  

  she left his father altogether and took
the small boy in her arms later she
looked at the man she was to marry and
confessed

   i guess i am john  

   what  

   your lady of windmills

  he smiled at her and at his son con-
tentedly

   but she added  so long as i am
yours - yours and bernards - it doesnt
matter does it  

aster and goldenrod

 by minna irving

  fair young queen upon her throne
  looked down in days of old

 and kneeling at her feet beheld
 a knight with plumes of gold

 her ancient palace by the sea

 her scepter and her crown-

 she left them all to follow him

   but kept her purple gown

 see yonder where the autumns torch
 has burned the stubble bare

 still side by side they gaily go

 the happy vagrant pair

 she wears the royal purple yet

   and yet untarnished nod
 his knightly plumes of brilliant gold-
 aster and goldenrod
protecting polly

         by ethellyn brewer defoe

  j-jow loves labor lost or was in
  a good way of losing the sole
  reason for its existence  jf-

rrom the very day when she had
discovered that with the aid of
the kitchen-table she could stand
alone polly had aspired to take
care of herself

  in time she not only took care of her-
self but also of her father and mother
and was a contributory source of no mean
value to an ever-increasing army of little
nieces and nephews polly was cheer-
fully willing and considered her respon-
sibilities no burden

  the one thing about her that was not
in perfect harmony was her name

  it should have been martial and com-
manding that was probably the reason
why in the office where  familiarity
but great fellowship was shown her they
called her the major and like a
plucky little major indeed she trudged
forth to her task

  weather meant nothing to her her
eyes glistened as she came in at midnight
from an assignment with the snow
clinging to her black crisp hair and a
healthy glow on her cheek of course
there were times when she was weary
and worn but her enthusiasm never
cooled and her indomitable spirit never
flagged

  she had a temper too she was no
patient griselda she was doing as good
work as any of the men with and among
them shoulder to shoulder and if they
forgot it and tried to thrust her aside on
the plea of the weaker sex she poured
forth the vials of her wrath indiscrimi-
nately upon all from the night city edi-
tor to the office-boys she stood her
ground gave good service and demand-
ed fair return

  at a very early age polly had realized

that her native town held little for her
so she came to new york alone but
unafraid and got a position on one of
the big dailies it was mean soul-
grinding work at first her consolation
lay in the fact that she was called upon
for strictly truthful accounts and tena-
ciously she clung to them keeping her
own standards exalted and unsmirched

  slowly but surely she rose her
acumen was good her discrimination
certain her sense of a story invaluable

  soon the paper began to realize that
she could be trusted her pen was
quick and did not make trouble in
short she had found herself she was
safely launched  the sea of journalism

  but this making of a little slip of
southern girlhood into a capable re-
porter  a responsible newspaper had
not happened in a day  nor in a year

  silver hairs had appeared among the
dark locks the twenties were past and
the thirties were trooping along the
major was very nearly middle-aged

  side by side with the major a dreamer
had been working there was  better
man on the staff none knew that he
was a dreamer not even the major al-
though she was his dream

  year after year robert mcpherson
had watched her as she came and went
laughing at the cold and snow scolding
good-naturedly at the enervating hu-
midity of new yorks merciless sum-
mers and a deep resentment had filled
his heart that it could not have been
different with her he longed to take
her out of it he hated to see her in
the midst of a work that daily laid bare
revolting depths of depravity

  he even as she had been under obliga-
tions to others whom he could not neg-
lect even after they both knew that
they were all in all to each other there
were years of waiting but they were
good years for now the majors life was
filled with the secret without which no
womans life is complete and robert was


protecting polly



filled with the joy of saving for the
materialization of his dream home which
would shield his polly-she had never
been the major to him-from all that
was sordid and brutal

  finally the day came when with their
duty to others discharged they could at
last enter into their own

  after the wedding-trip they went to
the dream home

  it had never been a flat in the dream
so although it awakened dread in the
majors heart she acquiesced when he
showed her a little house in a new suburb

  she had only once heard of it before
that was to interview a girl whose lover
after an evening spent with her had
jumped off the brooklyn bridge on his
way home the major wondered if
after a little of this suburban calm satu-
rated with cheap respectability she would
not be tempted to follow his example
but the joy in her husbands eyes moved
her so deeply that she put all else aside

  at first the excitement of buying fur-
niture and arranging their lielongings
filled the time and all went well but
after a few weeks everything was com-
plete and then the long lonely evenings
began to shut down on polly-the woman
so unused to indoors unused to idleness
or to womans task of the needle and
over and above all unused to being alive

  then too mammy the cld colored
servant who had been old for many years
could not cope with the work of a house
and polly-no longer the major please
-found her days becoming more and
more filled with the drudgery of house-
work

  as in all newspaper homes their morn-
ings were their evenings this was their
lime together this when they read and
walked and in those sunny hours the
little home seemed all that was cheerful
to robert but there were often days
when tired from a late assignment of the
night before he had to sleep until it was
time to go back to work so often polly
began and ended her silent day alone

  ihe people round her were simple
souls there were women whose lives
had been circumscribed the rearing of
children and ordering their little homes
filled their horizon

  polly tried fiction and did well at it

but the quiet of her home distracted her
it palled on her to do it all alone though
jii the office she could have written hour
in and hour out here she tired quickly

  when robert took her in his arms and
told her how great was his happiness in
the thought that at last she was shel-
tered from the buffeting of the world
told her of his strength his exhilaration
his lust for work because he had before
him the constant realization that at last
he was doing hers as well as his own
then indeed she almost cried out to him
but his joy was too beautiful

  if men could only realize that women
childless or otherwise will and must be
mothers it was the mother-instinct in
polly that kept her from letting robert
see how- miserable she was in his eldo-
rado she could not dash from his lips
the cup for which he had thirsted so
long

  ink on her fingers she had not mind-
ed but her whole being shrank with ac-
tual nausea from grease and oh to
the roving free-born spirit the reitera-
tion of housework the same things to
be dusted the same bed to be made day
in and day out three hundred and sixty-
five times a time

  the old life had been hard but 
two stories were ever quite the same no
two people of the hundreds whom she
met ever quite alike the office may
have been dingy and disorderly but it
teemed with -activity and life

  i	the long silent evenings her
thoughts turned to the office to the
city editor goading her like a gadfly to
catch the first edition to the thrill of
excitement as her story page by page
was whisked off by the copy-boy to the
lull till another assignment filled in
with an argument with another mind as
alert as her own a battle fought point
by point about some topic of to-mor-
rows news filled with good-natured
acrimony

  or an office joke for which  one
was ever too tired and for which time
could always be found

  that was where her robert was
where her old friends were where her
heart and life were

  the old comrades were playing the
glorious game and she the major-
hearted put her poor drooping head on


the all-story magazine

pollys pathetic attempt at sewing and
sobbed out her loneliness into the aw-
ful stillness of roberts protecting home

  polly began to grow pale and listless
as the summer came on robert asked
often and tenderly if she was doing too
much they had started a little garden
in the spring

  patiently polly bent over the unac-
customed task until her back and head
ached and somehow the things didnt
grow after all when they did she
could not find any great thrill over a
little green shoot but robert exulted
and told her how beneficial it was work-
ing in the soil

  she smiled still too much the mother
to tell the truth and ask of him the sac-
rifice of giving up this newly found
joy of protection

  as the weather grew pleasanter the
people from the office came out oftener
and robert was surprised to find how
keen was her interest in them and their
work but he laid it to her warm-
hearted concern for her old friends and
supposed much of it was tactfully as-
sumed

  he personally tried to keep his work
out of his home as much as he could
having read that fallacy somewhere in
his early youth and keeping it by him
as a beautiful but uninvestigated theory

  soon the old friends began to notice
a change they asked mcpherson if
she was not well and the dear old bat
said he feared she was feeling the effect
of the years of hard work before he had
been able to care for her

  she was sometimes tempted to ask him
if he had ever heard the story of the vet-
eran fire-engine horse that after receiv-
ing a reprieve insisted upon answering
all the alarms just the same she knew
how the poor old boy felt

  once tentatively she asked if he found
the little home and its surroundings all
that he had expected them to be and the

radiant smile with which he answered won
the day for the suburb

  but finally robert asked an old friend
who was a doctor to dine with them os-
tensibly the visit was social for polly
declared she was not at all ill

  he watched her carefully through din-
ner talking on every subject under the
sun except health

   does she need rest doctor  robert
asked anxiously when they were alone

   rest  the doctor snorted  did
you ever know a greyhound to thrive at
the end of a leash 

  robert calls her the major now she
is the editor of a magazine

  he finds that it is quite as delightful
to have her as a companion comrade and
fellow worker as it was to have her for a
charge

  she was not of the species ivy-she
could not cling and thrive

  but the knowledge that a strong arm
to lean upon is ever ready if she has need
of it to support her or to strike for her
has given her that beautiful impudent
independence that is possessed only by
dependent women she is a little arro-
gant in her love a little masterful per-
haps but robert is one of the men who
understand

  and robert-is he any less-happy

  he looks on with the tolerance of a st
bernard who is allowing a skye-terrier to
worry his bone

  his shelter is ready for her whenever
she tires his savings are accumulating for
their old age all is for her

  her work is her joy and his indulgence
-it is no longer stalked by grim neces-
sity

  deep in the strong tender heart that
was brave enough to let her choose her
own path he knows that he stands be-
tween her and the world quite as surely
as if he had locked her away to eat out
her heart

gillette safety razor

    a large number of gillette safety
    razors are bought by women who
    give them to their husbands or
    brothers

   men are amusingly conservative about new devices
for personal use a man will try a gillette if some-
body gives him one-and immediately become a gillette
enthusiast perhaps the most frequent occurrence is that of his
purchasing a gillette after having tried one that belonged to a
friend with whom he was visiting or camping or motoring

    the time to buy a gillette is now

    it pays for itself in three months and it lasts a lifetime

    the gillette illustrated herewith actual size is so compact
that it can be carried in the pocket or slipped in the side of a
traveling bag it comes in gold silver or gun metal-with
handle and blade box to match the blades are fine

    prices  to  for sale everywhere

   you should know gillette shaving brush-bristles gripped
in hard rubber and gillette shaving stick-a soap worthy of
the gillette safety razor
