  whirlwind users reporting the results of their tests are amazed at the results they are getting letters keep

  p p goerzen writes i made an actual test both with and without a whirlwind getting  miles without and
    miles with the whirlwind or a gain of  miles to the gallon the longer the whirlwind is in use on the ma-

the black

uhlan

 champ or
 palooka

by jimmy
de forest

dempseys twin so they
the invader max schmeling black
uhlan of the rhine as they groomed
him for his big shot against sharkey
   he looked like anything else but
dempseys twin to jimmy de for
est as that canny old trainer of
champs studied him from the ring-
side at the yankee stadium

max schmeling is heavy-
weight champion of the world
the title has been conferred
upon him because he won on a foul
from jack sharkey in the fourth round
of their fight last june

  it may be an unkind thing to say but
it is an unquestionably true one the
black uhlan of the rhine is the poor-
est champion we have ever had more
than that he is not even best among the
poor crop of big men who are making
fortunes in the prise-ring today

  i think that certainly jack sharkey
and possibly primo camera should rate
above him so if my judgment of him
is correct schmeling-despite his glory
as successor to corbett fitzsimmons
and dempsey-is only third best in his
class and a singularly unimpressive
class it is too

  outside the ring max is a pleasant
unassuming intelligent young man i
dislike saying anything that would hurt
his feelings or cast a cloud  his pres-
tige but the only honest thing to do is
to freely speak my mind no matter who
may take offense

  i believe that sharkey would have
beaten him decisively if he had not un-
fortunately fouled the black-haired ger-
man and it is my conviction that when
these men meet again jack will estab-
lish his superiority beyond any question
of doubt

  schmeling has had only half-a-dozen
bouts in america i have seen them all
and i have watched him day after day
in training studying not only his phys-
ical but his mental reactions from
this observation i know him as well
as any outsider can and it is on these




fight stories

observations that i base my judgment

  we can throw out maxs first two
victories-those over joe monte and
pietro corri neither are even second-
raters they know nothing of boxing
and are not hard hitters their only
claim to any sort of a place in the ring
is ability to take punishment and willing-
ness to endure it corri had been
knocked out frequently before fighting
schmeling and monte has suffered such
depressing defeats a number of times
since

  joe sekyra was maxs third opponent
joe is fairly clever and has a fine pair
of legs he was in there to stay the
limit so he ran as fast as he could all
the way schmeling chased him and
gave him a two-handed lacing from long
range but never could quite catch up
with him at least not well enough to
knock him out

  then they booked the black uhlan
with johnny risko and this made his
reputation because he knocked john out
-a feat no one else had been able to
accomplish

  lets study this fight a little in the
first place risko is not a fast man he is
not a clever one and he cannot hit his
success has been achieved because he
keeps crowding an opponent hailing
away all the time never letting the other
fellow get set if he can help it fast
clever fellows like tommy loughran
were able to make risko look pretty
bad but he won a lot of smashing vic-
tories over slower and more rugged
figters

  risko isnt smart but then schmeling
isnt either this statement will prob-
ably surprise a lot of people who figure
him to be pretty shrewd-headed in the
ring outside the ring max is intelli-
gent enough i make no aspersion
against his brains when i say he isnt
smart for i mean it entirely in a box-
ing sense put the most erudite college
professor you ever saw in the ring and
he would be a complete dumb-bell while
he had the gloves on some people have
an instinct for doing the right thing

when they are boxing schmeling
hasnt

  for one thing he becomes dazzled by
the crowd and the lights and excitement
it takes time for him to get his bear-
ings he is too stirred by his imagina-
tion before the sharkey fight the
physician who examined him found his
blood pressure extremely high and his
heart action far beyond normal the
germans are supposed to be phlegmatic
and cold-blooded but this is not true
of the black uhlan i assume that he
has been that way before all his bouts

  risko took the fight to schmeling just
as he does to everyone else he never
had any finesse all his battles are
waged along the same lines max knew
that he had seen johnny fight but
through the earlier rounds he didnt
know exactly what was the best thing to
do this is not an indication that the
german is a good student of the game

  though the records show that max
scored a knockout in the ninth round
the whole story isnt told by that up
until the final minute risko didnt have
any the worst of it in spite of the fact
that he is easy to hit max didnt land
on him nearly as much as he should
have he missed plenty frequently
risko made the uhlan fight the way he
wanted him to

  then zowie the right hand landed
on the button it hit the exact spot
where it would do the most damage
that punch nearly knocked johnnys
brains out he was rocky half blind
hadnt any defense left max had a
dead target to shoot at he just whanged
away with both hands at the helpless
baker until the referee stopped the fight

  schmeling is supposed to have a great
right ill admit that he has a good one
but he slammed risko on the chin half
a dozen times when john was in no
shape to protect himself and couldnt
drop him youll have to take some of
the credit away from his punch on that
performance do you think that johnny
would have kept on his feet under sim-
ilar conditions if dempsey had hit him
the black uhlan-

likc that-or bob fitzsimmons-or
jim jeffries

  not so you could notice it

  but my opinion isnt based on that
alone schmeling bats hard enough with
his right he can hurt a man plenty with
it which is more than you can say of a
lot of other heavyweights who talk big
and do little but though he was ac-
claimed to the skies for his technical
knockout of risko it seemed to me that
maxs very evident faults more than
overbalanced his good points at that
time

  suppose that wallop had missed in
that case johnny might have won or
gained a draw even if he lost the de-
cision it wouldnt have mattered much
for he had dropped plenty of others
but schmeling would have missed the
biggest ballyhoo of his life thats
what they sold him on-his knockout of
risko without that golden mark in
the record books he would have been
just another heavyweight

  i dont mean to say it was a lucky
punch it wasnt max had been
throwing right hands all night and a
number of others had landed knock-
ing out an iron man like risko isnt just
a question of getting to his chin the
blow has to be perfectly timed and land
in exactly the proper spot it did just
that-and made max schmelings for-
tune for him

  the uhlan showed that he had a
powerful right but his left was noth-
ing to rave about and the usual flaws of
a comparatively inexperienced boy were
evident in his work still he showed
enough to make his friends enthusiastic
if he could do that well so early in his
career there were high hopes that he
would add a lot to what he had already
shown

schmeling had imitated jack
dempseys style he fought out of
a sort of crouch but wasnt able to bob
and weave as the old mauler did the
style seemed suited to him but it wasnt
developed his handlers wanted to

champ or palooka	

turn him into a more upright fighter
not immediately against paulino the
crouch was still in evidence but while
training for sharkey it was almost en-
tirely abandoned

  there has been too much puttering
and tinkering with schmeling he is
essentially a fighter and not a boxer
he should be made to fight and not
box sharkey has forgotten more
about the mechanics of fisticuffs than
schmeling will ever know but skill
of course isnt essential in the winning
of a heavyweight championship sulli-
van jeffries and dempsey proved that
but without boxing ability you must
have ruggedness aggressiveness and a
real punch with the punch must go
not only power but accuracy

  maxs next fight was with paulino
he won the decision in fifteen rounds
giving the basque a terrible beating in
the last five a beating that turned
paulino into a bloody and mangled ob-
ject but again the same objections
found in the risko fight held good here
for the first ten rounds it was a miser-
able exhibition with the men standing
head to head and pawing away without
doing much damage in short it took
two-thirds of the fight for max to find
how to penetrate the burly spaniards
awkward guard that doesnt seem to
me an indication of exceeding smart-
ness

  still the interest in foreign fighters
and particularly the fact that schmeling
was the first championship contender to
come out of germany helped push him
along rapidly he has color and an in-
teresting style and his marked physical
resemblance to dempsey-aside from
his style-added to the publicity that
was given him

  had he kept in harness after his fight
with paulino the uhlan might have im-
proved considerably but trouble with
arthur bulow his former manager im-
pelled him to return home he didnt
want to fight because biilow held a con-
tract that permitted him to collect one-
third of schmelings earnings so in-


fight stories

stead of boxing regularly max took to
the gymnasiums and vaudeville theatres
of germany

  that year of comparative idleness
didnt do him any good i have said
frequently that a boxer must fight to
keep in proper shape all the sparring
practice in the world cant take the
place of a few keenly contested bouts
for getting a man in real trim schmel-
ing didnt have those fights and he did
himself a lot of harm by his abstinence

  still his knockout victory over risko
brought him continued praise most of
the boxing writers thought that john
was washed up physically but his fine
fights with von porat campolo and
others proved that this was not true
so schmelings triumph began to as-
sume greater and greater proportions

  eventually max was recognized as
the leading contender for the title gene
tunney had left vacant the new
york state athletic commission re-
scinded the ban it had placed on him
for refusing a scheduled match with
phil scott and decided to recognize the
winner of a stiarkey-schmeling bout as
heavyweight champion of the world

  it seems rather extraordinary when
you stop to think of it that a man who
had really accomplished so little should
have been given that opportunity
there were two reasons of course-the
lack of good big men and the fact that
schmeling was the best fighter in
europe

t watched the black uhlan very
a carefully in training as a mail
who has conditioned fighters for forty
years i think i can see what the aver-
age observer misses

  max was badly trained he did little
road work no bag punching and much
less boxing than he should have done
i imagine the automobile accident he
suffered in europe harmed his legs and
it was felt that too much road work
would do him  good people who
know what must be done to get a fighter
in shape understand that a training

period without lots of road work is so
much wasted time

  certainly schmeling looked slower
there was nothing impressive about his
foot work and the man who hasnt
spent time on the road will begin to
show what ails him along toward the
end of the bout fortunately for max
he won  a foul in the fourth round
so his lack of the right sort of work
didnt really show up in action

  against sharkey the german showed
 improvement over his match with
risko as a matter of fact i dont
think he was as good jack succeeded
in drawing him in and countering he
made schmeling miss a lot-and poor
judgment of distance is inevitable in a
fighter who has had a long layoff

  sharkey was absolutely confident that
he could whip schmeling and his con-
fidence was justified by what happened
in the ring not one of his opponents
gave him less trouble jack knocked
out tommy loughran in three rounds
but up to the time sharkey put over that
lightning finishing punch tom had
been giving him all he could handle

  the german didnt he was out-
boxed and out-hit and out-thought from
the first bell the only point on which
he surprised me was his ability to take
a punch he had been knocked out by
larry gains and gypsy daniels earlier
in his career and in none of his ameri-
can bouts had he been forced to meet a
real hitter so when sharkey blasted
him on the jaw with right-handers that
were labeled death and destruction it
was a little surprising to see max throw
them off and come right back for
more

  schmeling showed one bad hitting
fault in training he had a habit of
knocking down his opponents leads
with his right hand and then before he
could shoot a punch himself he had to
draw the arm back this telegraphed
the punch even to casual spectators at
the ringside there were other faults
in the uhlans lxxing too that proved
that he not only wasnt a finished per-
the black uhlan-champ or palooka



former but had some of the errors of a
novice

  his handlers at that time pressed
their efforts to change his style he
had developed it because as a young-
ster he was a great admirer of demp-
sey he had studied moving pictures
of the old champion and once boxed
with jack when the latter was on an
european trip of course he didnt
have dempseys cat-like speed though
he is fairly fast and he hadnt learned
to shift either but the style was his
he was at home with it

  not being in schmelings camp it
was none of my business to offer sug-
gestions i am pointing out these facts
as a disinterested observer as i have
said max showed no improvement
against sharkey and i dont believe he
will improve in future bouts either

  this may seem like a radical state-
ment i dont think it is

  usually when a boxer fails to better
his performance it is because he lacks
intelligence or because he is stubborn
and wont accept advice i dont think
either of these things is true in the
germans case he has brains and is
well educated even though he isnt in
my opinion a smart fighter the draw-
back is the injury he suffered last win-
ter if he as i think likely fails to go
ahead the cause will be physical rather
than mental

  before the sharkey-schmeling fight
i picked the sailor to win it seemed to
me that he was a better boxer a better
hitter with both hands and had a more
natural ring intelligence despite his hot
temperament and likelihood of going
off at a tangent schmelings perform-
ance in training was so mediocre and
sharkeys so brilliant that my belief
was further strengthened

  nothing that occurred in the fight it-
self tended to change my opinion
sharkey was far in the lead when he
accidentally hooked that low left into
maxs body in my opinion had the
fight continued the american would
not only have won by a wide margin he

might have knocked schmeling out
there is nothing to bolster the conten-
tion that sharkey was tiring as max
grew stronger jack was boxing coolly
and well as a matter oi fact he never
looked better than he did that night
though some of his brilliance may have
been due to the uhlans mediocre per-
formance of course fifteen rounds is
a long way to go and lots of things can
happen but certainly all the evidence so
far produced is in sharkeys favor

when they meet again just about
the same thing will happen-bar-
ring the foul schmeling will undoubt-
edly turn in the same sort of perform-
ance he did the first time and he
showed then that it wasnt good enough
it is enough of course for the riskos
and paulinos and von porats but not
enough for a fellow like sharkey

  a first-class fighter must have some
sort of defense it may be a defense
built on first-rate boxing skill such as
corbetts it may be a weaving bob-
bing style such as dempsey had but de-
fense of some sort must be there max
showed little ability to block he was
pinned  a left jab and was wide open
for a right cross to the jaw the few
times that jack let loose his vicious
hooks for the body they landed too

  some months ago in fight stories i
wrote an imaginary account of a fight
between schmeling and dempsey had
they been together in the ring last june
my story would have been turned into
fact by what happened jack has lost
much of his speed but still has a ter-
rible power in his fists old as he is if
he had been hitting schmeling as
sliarkey did the black uhlan would
have finished  the floor completely
knocked out max could not have kept
away from dempseys blows and those
blows would have ruined him in spite
of all his stamina and courage

   tf a fighter lacks defensive ability he
must have a furious ceaseless attack
that takes the place of it stanley
ketchel had he kept firing with both


fight stories

hands all the time he was in there
ketchel hit so hard and fast that the
other fellow didnt have much chance to
be aggressive himself

  as an example of a light hitter whose
attack was his defense it is only neces-
sary to cite harry greb the pitts-
burgh windmill cuffed and slapped and
hit from every angle and let loose a
hundred blows a minute no single
one was dangerous in itself but they
came in such a shower that his rivals
were continually off balance and swept
away in the flood of blows

  schmeling in his attack is neither a
ketchel nor a greb he cannot keep
up such a sustained and furious volley
he hits pretty well with either hand
both his left hook and right cross hav-
ing lots of power but for all that
max isnt a really good hitter for he
lacks accuracy against a man who
knows how to box it didnt mean so
much that he was able to land so easily
on johnny risko and paulino uzcudun
they have always been targets even
for less accomplished men than max
schmeling it was lucky for him that
he was born in a generation when there
are so few good fighting men

  the black uhlan is a strong fellow
but not as strong as sharkey who

handled him rather easily in the
clinches schmeling has not yet become
a good man in the clinches he doesnt
know all that a champion should about
this important phase of his business

  it may sound as though i am rather
hard on max i dont mean to be but
we cant be too easy on a champion of
the world he should be an expert in-
dubitably the best of all who play his
game but schmeling isnt he is
really still in the experimental stage
even though he is recognized as king of
all the fighters in the world

  i can say nothing against his courage
or his hitting power his colorful per-
sonality or his ability to keep going in
the face of punishment these are as-
sets that a champion must have but in
themselves they are not enough

  but he hasnt the boxing skill that
would have made him any sort of a
match for tunney nor a wallop that
would have permitted him to meet
dempsey on even grounds to go even
a bit lower in the fistic scale he hasnt
enough all-around ability to cope with
sharkey mark my word when these
two men meet again the german will
take the zvorst thumping of his life

  he may be champion of the world-
but in name only

 but on the other hand-

im stringing with schmeling

  so says james p dawson boxing expert and nationally known sports
  writer in reply to de forest and once more-after a series of
  smashing arguments rich in analysis of these fighters-he picks
  schmeling to defeat sharkey when they meet again

 by james p dawson

i

am glad to be the champion i
could not be otherwise than
glad i have what you call it
reached my goal but i am not satis-
fied better i had knocked out sharkey
or beat him on a decision than to win
by a foul there is something missing

in such a victory to me it is disap-
pointing as it is to the people because
i know i can knock out sharkey i
felt it before the fight and i never was
so sure of anything in my life as i was
after that third round however i
will have my chance and if sharkey
pm stringing with schmeling



thinks he can knock me out he will
have his chance i want the american
people and the people of the world to
know that max schmeling is a real
champion worthy in every way of the
title or that max schmeling is not a
worthy champion because he is knocked
out or beaten by a better man

  max schmeling was talking

  the german lad had just returned to
his quarters at the hotel concourse
plaza in new yorks bronx borough
to the east of the yankee stadium in
that yankee stadium schmeling had
just won the worlds heavyweight cham-
pionship from jack sharkey bostons
ex-gob who was and is americas pre-
mier heavyweight

  prone on a bed enveloped in a
musty-colored bathrobe schmeling fur-
nished a strangely novel picture from
the accepted order of things in this his
first hour as boxing monarch of the
world shattered were the conventional
illusions gone the mistaken belief that
a new kings life in the realm of sport
opens with a dash and a splurge and a
wild riot of excitement and uncontrolled
celebration

  with schmeling were his manager
joe jacobs fiery-faced and highly ner-
vous  max machon quiet-spoken pen-
sive german trainer pal adviser and
friend mushky jackson associate of
schmelings during their training camp
life at endicott n y detectives cas-
well jacobs and roger meehan the for-
mer a brother of schmelings manager
benny jacobs another of the brothers
also was there discussing the recent
fight

  into this atmosphere of subdued re-
spectful jubilation i projected myself
in the line of duty like many other
critics i was eager to get schmelings
immediate reactions to the possession of
a title as rich in tradition as it is in
financial rewards it happened that i
was the first to intrude upon the new
champions solitude for that is exactly
what it was

  there was no popping of corks no

blatant turmoil no overwhelming crush
of the hero-worshipers to the throne-
room quite the opposite liquids there
were to be sure white rock and gin-
ger ale for the guests milk for the host
who contrary to popular belief is an ab-
stainer and there was a buffet of
sandwiches and collee a quiet little
family gathering eh

  it was as schmeling wanted it he
likes quiet and seclusion it is the nor-
mal desire of a stolid retiring modest
disposition he was unmarked physi-
cally at the time he admitted no pain
from sharkeys blows and he showed
no bruise but the following day he had
a growth about the size of a pigeons
egg between the eyes and directly above
the nose as a reminder of the battle
which brought him the title and there
was a little discoloration about the left
eye at the bridge of the nose

  i mention this post-battle setting be-
cause it is a natural part of the story
and a distinct undeniable reflection of a
side of schmelings nature which is his
greatest ring characteristic though he
showed no surface marks he was in
pain nevertheless and for two very
good reasons

 the low left hook with which
sharkey ended the battle and his chances
of becoming the worlds heavyweight
champion left its sting and there
was the mental anguish schmeling felt
as a result of the disputed and unsatis-
factory termination of the bout

  i am not satisfied i do not want
to be champion this way better i had
knocked out sharkey- and if the
truth were known schmeling was wish-
ing that if he could not knock out
sharkey he had been knocked out him-
self at least then he would have had
the satisfaction of a warrior who had
gone down fighting gloriously he
would not have been the occupant of a
throne on an all too shaky foundation

i can appreciate schmelings feel-
ings for i know the lad better
perhaps than most others not directly


fight stories

associated with him and knowing him
i subscribe to his protestations that he
would have conquered sharkey even in
the face of the near-disastrous third
round which was not however as dis-
astrous in its threat to schmelings safe-
being as it appeared to the onlookers

  in this i am merely owning to a con-
viction or a belief and in arriving at
my conviction i use that third round
barometer just as others use it to prove
that sharkey must assuredly have
knocked out schmeling the difference
is that i interpret the third round dif-
ferently

  schmeling is the stolid mechanical
plodding type he comes of a race
whose members were thrown uncom-
plainingly into the cannons death-deal-
ing maw who went blindly unflinch-
ingly to their doom because they were
drilled painstakingly and methodically
to do just that-for a cause

  schmeling was fighting methodically
for a cause in his ring war with
sharkey

  he was fighting moreover against a
foeman whose steel was none too sharp
whose fighting equipment aside from
competitive ability alone was none too
reliable because of an undependable
morale

  schmeling figured on fighting just the
sort of battle he waged and was coached
to fight as he did with but a single ex-
ception he was not advised to keep
his chin up as an inviting target he
planned to take what sharkey had to
offer in the early rounds to test
sharkeys emotional reaction it had
been suspected that if sharkey failed
early in a destructive assault he would
grow lethargic to the point of indiffer-
ence his morale would fall and his
temperament would assert itself to his
own destruction in the vernacular of
the ring it was suspected by some and
boldly proclaimed by others particularly
those of the schmeling camp that
sharkey would lose heart if he could
not knock schmeling over with one
death-dealing fiery outburst

  this is no reflection on sharkeys
courage his fearlessness in battle is
established rather it is an indefinable
psychological condition a temperamen-
tal reaction which unknowingly over-
comes a fighter who sees his best efforts
wasted few fighters are constructed
to overcome the disheartening experi-
ence of pounding away without result

  in his appraisal of sharkeys princi-
pal weakness schmeling had past per-
formances on which to base his conclu-
sions he knew that johnny risko had
beaten sharkey at an important time in
the career of the boston heavyweight
he was aware that tom heeney the
immovable rock from down under
had cast a painful shadow across the
sharkey path in another critical bout
which ended in a draw he knew that
it was sharkeys weakness and for all
i know always will be his weakness to
fail when success means so much to him
notwithstanding that success in this lat-
est instance meant the realization of all
his dreams

  perhaps this very responsibility can
be calculated to contribute to the col-
lapse of a sliarkey battle plan when you
know the temperamental sharkey and
there was the sting of that raucous jeer-
ing to which he was subjected as he
entered the ring for battle the stars and
stripes cloaking his shoulders over the
blue dressing gown he wears with its
naval insignia usn in gold letters

  this reception for sharkey an amer-
ican before a home crowd about to
launch a battle for a title which has
been almost exclusively an american
possession since the beginning of mod-
ern boxing moved even schmeling to
sympathetic impulse and his reaction
was one of resentment toward the
crowd

  it was not nice i think said
schmeling i wanted to cross the ring
and pat him on the back or shake his
hand or do something to make him feel
comfortable because i know how i
would feel if i were treated that way
yet it was good for me because it
pm stringing with schmeling



must have the effect of discouraging
sharkey

  it might be argued that sharkeys re-
action to this reception would be one of
cool indifference and mocking disdain
this perhaps would have been true a
year ago at a time when sharkey was
held in only moderate esteem when he
was not actually ridiculed and ignored
but the sharkey who stepped quickly up
the steps to the battle platform in the
yankee stadium on last june th had
only a short time before been accorded
a thunderous ovation in madison
square garden when he slipped through
the ropes to be presented to the crowd

  such a reception as he received in the
garden was regarded by many as more
harmful than beneficial to the hertofore
indifferent sharkey because it only
added to his feeling of responsibility-
this sudden awakening to the realization
that he was a popular hero almost over-
night and not the despised boxer he had
thought himself

  you have therefore the picture of a
man weighted down with conflicting
emotions burdened with the importance
of the role that was his in the drama
spreading before him facing a youth
who was indifferent to these conditions
almost to the point of imperviousness

  schmeling had  worries other than
those presented by the ever-present
prospect of annoyances from a dis-
carded manager and the realization that
he was appearing before a staggering
mass of strangers in a strange land to
the last-named condition schmeling nat-
urally experienced a slight nervousness
but this disappeared when introductions
were over and the men were called to
the center of the ring

  then schmeling was the methodically
trained fighter waging a battle for a
cause and his cause was the destruc-
tion of sharkey and the acquisition of
the worlds heavyweight championship

physically there was little dif-
ference between the men schmel-
ing entered the ring something of an un-

known quantity who was yet known to
a certain degree he had had five battles
in american rings after coming unher-
alded and unsung to this country in the
spring of  in succession he
knocked out joe monte at a time when
 other heavyweights were knocking
out monte gained a decision over joe
sekyra in a bout in which the dayton
ohio lad spent the night retreating not
strategically but desperately and dis-
orderly knocked out pietro corri in a
round and johnny risko in nine and
battered his way to a decision over the
rugged stout-hearted paulino in fifteen
rounds of systematic plodding fighting

  schmelings gamble was an invitation
to sharkey to do his best in the first five
rounds it was as if schmeling said to
himself i will let him hit me with
everything early in the fight and if i
go down and out so be it but i know
i will not go down nor will i go out
for i am capable of taking his best with-
out wilting then after this disap-
pointment he must feel in the failure of
his early work i will go after sharkey
and he will be mine

  sharkeys past record supported
schmelings confidence in this respect
the german lad had been expertly ad-
vised by manager jacobs of sharkeys
suspected weaknesses of which the
chief was his uncontrollable tempera-
ment

  it has been held that sharkeys battle
against jack dempsey back in  of-
fers the best illustration of this condi-
tion it will be recalled that sharkey
with a fiery outburst of fighting in the
opening round had what then remained
of the once invincible dempsey reeling
and staggering around the ring under a
volley of powerful right- and left-hand
drives to the jaw it looked as if demp-
sey must be knocked out in the first
round and the great crowd looked on
in amazement tinged with sorrow for
the threatened fall of a ring idol

  but dempsey survived that danger-
ous situation and sharkeys failure had
an unfavorable reaction upon him the


fight stories

consequence was that dempsey plodded
blindly on fighting against the demor-
alized sharkey until the seventh round
when his blows aimed for the body
which i have always maintained were
foul caused the ex-gobs collapse this
was aided as he crumpled by a left
hook to the jaw

  the late leo p flynn for whose
judgment i have always had the highest
respect said that heart won that bat-
tle for dempsey disagreeing violently
with me when i protested that sharkey
had been fouled four times with right-
hand drives aimed at the body and
when he referred to heart flynn did
not mean that sharkey was a coward
but that dempsey was too indifferent to
punishing blows from the ex-gob who
upon realizing this became discouraged

  dempsey was a rushing tearing fear-
less type of fighter whose object was
to accomplish the downfall of a foe in
a minimum time and with a maximum
of satisfaction he represented a type
against which sharkey always has had
trouble the cases of johnny risko
and tom ileeney are advanced in sup-
port of this contention ileeney built
a career which brought him the title
bout against gene tunney on his fight-
ing heart almost exclusively he held
sharkey to a draw simply because he
rushed at him with a consistency that
was discouraging to the ex-sailorman
and caused sharkey to forget what he
knew about boxing and straight accu-
rate forceful hitting in his alarm

  johnny risko was another case in
point the cleveland ex-baker-boy has
the true fighters heart he overcame
sharkey more by the storm of his fu-
rious ever-pressing style than by the
force of his blows for risko is a noto-
riously weak hitter-a puncher who
punishes without crushing risko won
a decision over sharkey and robbed the
boston heavyweight of a promised
match against gene tunney for the title
and only because sharkey could not
bring himself to the belief that a stead-
ied coolly calculated battle would avail

against a fighter of this type indeed
risko was so busy on the attack in that
battle that sharkey being constituted
temperamentally as he is had no time
for thought of an effective counter-
offensive he just wanted to protect
himself as best he could against the
flailing arms of an annoying foe

  it has been argued that sharkey was
misinformed in his corner as to the
progress of this battle-that he was told
he was leading on points and that vic-
tory was assured when as a matter of
fact the reverse was the case but i
place no stock in this explanation for
the simple reason that any man engaged
in a battle knows when he is and when
he is not getting the best of a foe
knows it better indeed than do many
of the onlookers because he is in there
taking them and giving them and feel-
ing an opponents reaction to blows as
he experiences his own

schmeling had satisfied himself
in advance of the battle that stolid
resistance to a sharkey fire even with-
out a determined counter would ruin
the morale of the american bidder for
the title he had been told and it had
been impressed upon him that orlando
reverberi had floored sharkey and that
quintin romero-rojas had knocked out
the ex-gob these facts were particu-
larly stressed for the benefit of the in-
vading german and the consequence
was that schmelings supreme confi-
dence in his own ability was increased
proportionately

  i hold that sharkeys and schmelings
bouts with risko offer the most accu-
rate indication of their relative fighting
qualities the risko who scampered
off with a decision over sharkey in 
was knocked out on february  
in nine rounds by schmeling the com-
parison on actual results is not the guid-
ing influence in basing deductions nec-
essarily but the meter of each battle
offers a concrete basis in favor of
schmeling whereas risko simply
overwhelmed sharkey the cleveland
im stringing with schmeling



heavyweight went down to his first and
only knockout at the hands of schmel-
ing at a time when risko was leading
on points

  for some unexplained reason the fact
that risko was leading on points at the
time he was knocked out is advanced by
many as proof that schmeling accom-
plished riskos downfall with a lucky
punch or a succession of fluke punches
it is recalled that schmeling had risko
on the deck in the first round of their
struggle that the german lad floored
his american rival with an early punch
only to have risko arise and thereafter
proceed to subject schmeling to a char-
acteristic risko lambasting which did
not end until schmeling knocked out the
clevelander in the ninth round

  in this interpretation schmeling is
the victim of a grave injustice his
fighting determination and methodical
style are not accorded the consideration
they deserve when he came from be-
hind to score a knockout schmeling ac-
complished the unusual and demon-
strated his ability to assimilate punish-
ment without becoming discouraged
he felt that he could topple risko when
next he hit him squarely on a vulner-
able spot and was content to plod along
until the opportunity to hit that vulner-
able spot presented itself it made no
difference to schmeling that he exposed
himself to seven solid rounds of punish-
ment it was his plan and his style
and he did exactly what he calculated he
could and would do and he had his
reward in a victory which projected him
forthwith into the front ranks of the
title-seekers

  a contrast is glaringly presented
sharkey with every incentive to urge
him on in his fight against risko could
not overcome his greatest weakness-
temperamental emotion schmeling on
the other hand with victory within his
grasp in the first round refused to be-
come excited and press his advantage
rather he bided his time protected him-
self against a possible injury to his
hands in punching at a carefully cov-

ered and protected antagonist and
claimed his reward when it was long
overdue

  the paulino battle offers another con-
trast schmeling accepted a match with
the spaniard at a time when paulino
was being advanced as one of the most
dangerous of the title contenders he
then proceeded to batter and pound and
belabor paulino through fifteen rounds
in a style and at a pace to which paulino
was popularly supposed to be best ac-
customed sharkey never would fight
paulino

  the paulino battle established schmel-
ing as the purely methodical fighter he
is the risko fight demonstrated
schmelings ability to come from behind
and win and the combination justified
an advance prediction that schmeling
would conquer sharkey

against sharkey schmeling
fought a battle that was similar
to the one he waged against risko he
was cautious at the start content to feel
sharkey out and at the same time dis-
courage the american through an abil-
ity to take his best blows

  and schmeling proved conclusively
in that third round that he could take
sharkeys best without wilting he was
hammered mercilessly about the ring or
so it seemed in one outburst still fresh
in memory sharkey cracked a terrific
right to the jaw and then as schmel-
ing went backward toward the ropes
leaped after him pumping one two
three more powerful right-hand drives
to the jaw face and head schmeling
said after the battle that he was in 
danger but his appearance under the
fire justified a contrary illusion for
schmeling was rocked and stung and
hurt but he lived through this storm
and through sharkeys successive
punching outbursts until near the end
of the round when he resumed his ag-
gressive tactics and hooked a left to
sharkeys jjody and crossed a grazing
right to the jaw

  the finish came in the fourth and


fight stories

prevented a demonstration of the theory
schmeling was trying to put in practice
perhaps i should say the finish delayed
a demonstration of schmelings theory
that an undying spirit unflinching de-
termination and a fighting heart that
admits of no reverse will ride to vic-
tory-because i am convinced that in an-
other match schmeling will knock out
sharkey or beat him so badly there will
be no room for doubt as to the germans
superiority

  schmelings own account of that third
round is pertinent after the battle the
german lad said in effect

  i knew i could beat sharkey after
the third round he gave me every-
thing he had and i was not hurt he
hit me one clean punch on the chin
here-indicating a point on the left
side of his jawbone-and i felt it i
tell you but i was not hurt my legs
and my head were what you call o k
and before the round was over i was
fighting him back rushing at him and
hitting him to the body and to the jaw
with my own punches when i went
to my corner after the round joe
jacobs put the smelling salts under my
nose but i pushed them away and said
that is not necessary joe i am all
right

  when i came up for the fourth
round i felt that sharkey was not the
same man he was different than the
man i had been fighting through the
first second and the third rounds i
cannot say what but there was some-
thing missing the way he was hitting

me his punches were not so strong
and he did not seem the same maybe
lie had lost heart when i did not go down
in the third round that was the way
he impressed me and i knew that i
had him where i wanted him and that
i would get him later on

  i am impressed by schmelings ac-
count of his experiences in the third
round which we all thought so threat-
ening for the german lad he bespeaks
quietly a supreme confidence in his abil-
ity to assimilate punishment as well as
in his punching power-and it cannot
be denied that he hits as hard as shar-
key if not harder he is more deter-
mined than ever whereas sharkey has
cause for further discouragement

  that he experienced no lessening of
confidence is reflected in schmelings
prompt decision to give sharkey an-
other chance and without delay in
this schmeling admittedly is in a class
by himself for the custom is to capital-
ize on the title without regard to public
opinion schmeling could have done
this without ridicule for he won the
title on a decision which called a foul
that could not be overlooked but
schmeling chose the sportsmans path
and is deserving of commendation

  he may be wrong i may be wrong
none of us is infallible

  but another battle should be inter-
esting for the opportunity it offers to
demonstrate a disputed theory

  and im stringing along with schmel-
ing-heavyweight champion of the
world and worthy of the title

up from the pork-and-beaners glorying in the smack of wet leather batter-
ing his way to the big shots-that was tommy dugan until the heavy hand
of fate singled him out for the leading part in a drama of unbrotherly love

complete fight novelet

    ahe scrappy one o them dugan
       brats that always meant
       tommy

  tommy dugan was born and grew up
in the third ward of harlow a city of
a hundred thousand population not far
from new york and since every youth-
ful argument in the third ward is
settled either by a fight or by a foot-
race and since tommy was built like
an iron safe-the same dimension what-
ever way you looked at him-it was at
an early age that he became known as
th scrappy one

  these were the terms in which irate
mothers of the local population referred
to him while bewailing black eyes
bloody noses and other personal dam-
age to their offspring but among his
fellows he enjoyed more honor for the
youth of the third ward do not care

much for boxing but they do love
fighting

  of a thousand men who attend prize-
fights ninety per cent say they go to
see good sparring-and about onc-tenth
of one per cent tell the truth they go
to see a courageous exchange of blows
to hear the smack of wet leather land-
ing on the human countenance to see
blood flow to see a mans knees sag
when a hard punch goes home to see
someone drop and be counted out and
tommy dugans young companions
were like their fathers

 tommy was no boxer the finer
points of jab and duck and feint and
block remained a sealed mystery to him
but he came in time to be the idol of
the crowd for his notion of fighting
was to set himself firmly on his feet
bend forward and work both arms like




fight stories

the dancing piston-rods of a steam-
engine until someone-usually his op-
ponent-went down

  any clever boxer could walk around
him like a cooper going round a barrel
hit him with everything but the referees
watch and the kitchen sink and take
the decision but let that boxer come
within range of tommys fists indulge
in a split-second of inattention or for-
get to duck one and he would wake
some minutes later to ask in a blurred
manner why the roof fell in

  tommy had small respect for these
cream-puff fighters an opponent who
would stand toe to toe with him and
trade wallops was his delight but he
owned little respect or liking for the
hit-and-run boys

  so tommy dugan fought his way up
through the ranks of the pork-and-
beaners to the top of the top flight
and this is the story of how he climbed
the first rung of that long ladder

when tommy was fifteen and his
brother michael was a year
older their father became involved in
an argument with some friends and was
patted on the head with a piece of irish
confetti he had a magnificent funeral
but he left little provision for his family
and tommy and mike had to go to
work

  tommy was the fighting unit of the
pair but it was mike who had the head-
piece slim graceful good-looking he
resembled tommy about as much as a
panther resembles a bear further he
had latent within him the mean
treacherous streak of the big cat though
tliis did not become apparent until later
in life during early boyhood mike was
noted chiefly for his cleverness

  mike however wras  coward and
did not take to his heels when battle
threatened but on the other hand he did
not rush to combat with the joyful en-
thusiasm of the younger brother it
was mike who pointed out that there
was money to be made in selling papers
it was tommy who fought off the boys

who resented an invasion of their pre-
empted territory it was mike who
counted and kept the money it was
tommys job to shove and elbow his
way through the crowd at the news-
paper office to get first chance at the
distribution

  also it was mike who observed and
acted upon the fact that the most profit-
able form of the business is selling
sporting editions at the fights why
should this be so the answer was that
the free-handed sporting man often
hands out a dime or a quarter some-
times even half a dollar with the de-
lightful words keep the change

  so tommy and mike spent man- of
their evenings circulating among the
fight spectators at the armor where
the harlow sporting club holds forth
to a semi-soup-and-fish clientele at the
gloria theater a cheap joint run by
jack spurge and frequented by the
tough babies and at the donovan box-
ing club which for quality of fights
and customers is midway between the
other two

  they did not pay their way in that
would have been a foolish waste of good
money they simply eased themselves
in with the crowd the ticket-taker pass-
ing them on with a good-humored nod
but once inside there was no law
against combining business with
pleasure and they naturally hung
around to watch the fights

  it was one night at the armory while
gazing at the preliminary bouts that
mike first became inspired with the
thought that there was money to be
made from his brothers fistic ability
marty callahan also from the third
ward and well known to the dugan
brothers went on with another pork-
and-beaner and gave him a beautiful
lacing winning on a technical k o in
the third round of a scheduled four-
rounder

  marty was a rough-and-tumble
fighter and had several times been
beaten by tommy dugan in impromptu
battles it now occurred to mike
sons of sock



watching that if marty could get money
for it there was no reason why tommy
shouldnt and he promptly visioned for
himself a glowing and affluent future as
manager of a local ring favorite for
the moment his aspirations went no
higher but he turned to his brother re-
marking 

  cripes tommy you can take that
callahan guy if he drags down the
coin for this kind of a show why
wouldnt you

  tommy wagged his head the idea
percolated slowly finally he an-
swered 

  i wonder how much he gets
moren he could selling papers i
bet im going to find out this might
maybe be good would you fight him
in the ring

  tommy let this ramble around in his
cogitations then simply

  sure why not

the boys were standing back of the
rear row of seats and near them
a stout individual in a pepper-and-salt
suit and an iron kelly was leaning
against the wall overhearing the con-
versation he rolled a gigantic cigar to
the far corner of his mouth and spoke
around it

  you say that kids licked callahan
sure answered mike promptly
aint you tommy

  tommy debated the question with
himself at length responding

  sure

  whats he weigh

  about one twenty-eight

  the exact tonnage of a preliminary
fighter is never a world-stirring matter
and the inquirer nodded satisfied

  how long since he trimmed calla-
han

   bout two months

  a lot can happen in two months
dryly commented the stout person he
want to go on with him

  sure dont you tommy
tommy gave this careful considera-
tion

  fight-sept-

  sure he finally assented

  come around and see me in the
morning said the stout man ask for
mr rosenthal im matchmaker for
the club ill be in my office upstairs
well be there mike promised
then how much do we get

  rosenthal turned a sardonic eye on
the questioner

  always the business man he said
there aint no more like ad wol-
gast all he ever asked was when
do i fight never did he say who
how much  all he wanted to know
was when  

  yeah mike defended himself
and look at him now-cutting out
paper dolls with round-nosed scissors
its a business proposition aint it you
aint doing it for fun your ownself are
you 

  thats whats killing the game
rosenthal evaded always how
much  never can i give the crowd
a good show  mr rosenthal was no
philanthropist any time he could talk a
fighter into taking a small cut so much
the better for the harlow sporting club

  how much  persisted the hard-
boiled mike and the other grunted
fifteen if he wins nothing if he
loses

  it aint so much demurred mike
to which rosenthal answered

  take it or leave it who dyou
think he is-jack dempsey its bet-
tern a kick in the pants

  yeah mike agreed its bettern a
kick in the pants he could afford to
be philosophical he was not the one
who would be in there absorbing
martys punches all right well be
on hand in the morning

chapter ii
fighting his way

hope springs eternal in the human
breast and marty callahan was
chock-full of hope the mere fact that


fight stories

he had already taken three informal
beatings from tommy dugan didnt dis-
courage him from again taking on the
dugan brat

  the following friday night there-
fore saw tommy contemplating marty
across a square of once-white canvas
some three feet above the floor of the
armory he had often seen the roped
ring and the crowd but never from that
point of vantage and he gazed about
with interest-things look different
when you arc in the ring he felt an
odd thrill akin to stage-fright as he re-
alized that all those people were there to
see him fight but he was recalled to
himself by the referees summons step-
ping forward he and mike met marty
and his second received their instruc-
tions and the four retired the
fighters overcoats were removed
neither of them had risen to the dig-
nity of a bathrobe and the gong
sounded

  tommy bent his head for an instant
then shuffling out in a queer bear-like
fashion he encountered marty in the
center of the ring they touched
gloves eyed each other for a moment
then with one impulse ducked their
heads stepped in close and set to work
on each others midriffs

  within thirty seconds the whole
audience was on its several and collective
feet howling this was no foot-race
-this was a fight

  neither tommy nor marty had the
slightest notion of boxing they simply
fought as fast and as hard as their fists
would fly each taking all the other had
to give and each firmly resolved that the
other would back up first

  for three solid minutes this went on
and by the end of the first round the
fifteen hundred men and two or three
hundred women of the audience were
fairly mad with delight they yelled
screamed howled cheered bellowed
stamped-in fact gave vent to their joy
with every kind of noise they could
find in their systems and when the gong
sounded and the referee had to pry the

fighters apart the spectators were al-
most as tired as and far hoarser than
the battlers themselves

  the second round was a repetition of
the first except that some twenty
seconds before the gong marty stepped
back even his rugged anatomy was not
proof against so ferocious a battering
and that backward step was the be-
ginning of the end by the close of the
third round mr callahan was through
for the evening the spirit was still
willing but the flesh had taken a-plenty

  as the movies gracefully put it this
was the dawn of a new day for our
hero more prosaically mike sold out
the newspaper business and he and
tommy devoted themselves entirely to
the fight game

  isidor rosenthal having a fine ap-
preciation of what pleases the public
congratulated himself on a valuable dis-
covery and exploited tommy to the
full in an extraordinary burst of
generosity he handed tommy twenty-
five dollars for the evenings work and
offered him another engagement for the
following week

  the offer was accepted carried to a
triumphant conclusion and mike the
business man thereupon decided that
managing a fighter was the life-work for
which nature had designed him

reading everything he could find
on the subject of training mike
set about developing the gift the gods
had dropped in his lap and he worked
his brother for further orders

  you gotta train he assured tom-
my vehemently this business o
fighting on a clean shave and a run
around the block aint going to get us
nowheres pretty soon rosenthals go-
ing to put us on in a semi-final and then
in a ten-rounder and you gotta be in
shape to go the distance and besides
if youre in shape the other guys
punches aint going to hurt so much
mikes use of pronouns showed that he
possessed the managerial instinct when
a fighter is successful or there is money
sons of sock



to be shared its us when he fails
or there is work to be done its
you

  i dont like training objected
tommy theres fun in fighting but
there aint no fun in training road
work pulling the weights skipping
rope shadow-boxing-its dumb

  so are you dumb asseverated mike
you like the coin doncha and
tommy was obliged to admit that he
did

  having a frugal mind mike saw no
sense in paying good money to work
out in a regular gymnasium when there
was a whole barn going to waste back
of the house

  he fixed the place up for a gym and
then found himself confronted by the
question of sparring partners he ob-
jected to spending money on what he
scornfully termed a bunch of pa-
lookas but recognized the need of such
assistants so one night at the armory
when no one was watching he dropped
a set of gloves out of the dressing-room
window later recovering them in a
wholly inconspicuous fashion it is to
be feared that mikes ethics were a
trifle scrambled

  he then declared himself a sparring
partner and worked out with his
brother for several rounds each day no
match for tommy in rough-and-tumble
fighting in self-protection he developed
no slight amount of boxing skill and in
a years time could have performed with
credit against any of the armory
favorites but when this was pointed
out to him he laughed contemptuously

  for why should i go in there and
get myself banged up he demanded
theres more money in managing
tommy there hes dumb and aint no
good for nothing else but i got brains
for why should i want to get myself
pounded goofy he had observed
the mental fog that sooner or later
envelops the hit-and-take-it boys
tommy he does the fighting he con-
cluded but im the brains of the
combine

  tommy listening grinned amiably
he was far from the imbecile his brother
asserted him to be but he recognized
mikes superior mentality

  there is no question that mike was
keen observing closely picking up
ring gossip wherever it was to be found
and sharpening his wits in constant com-
petition he avoided dangerous op-
ponents secured for tommy as near a
collection of set-ups as a prelim boy ever
gets and gradually raised his demands
until tommy was fighting every fort-
night in the semi-finals and several times
in the main bouts and he battled ver-
bally with rosenthal until that hard-
boiled but sagacious individual was
paying the dugan brothers  a fight
which in the third ward is important
money-with capitals please

  of course mike took half of every
purse and equally of course tommy
turned his half over to his mother so
it is hard to see just where the profit
for the younger brother came in how-
ever he never stopped to analyze that
question he wtas earning money and his
mother was taking care of the house
so why shouldnt he hand it over to her
did mike turn his half into the family
budget laughter from the gallery
the elder brother plucked the tail-
feathers from every eagle and banked
what was left

bout the time that tommy
achieved the distinction of the
main bout he began to notice at the
ringside a pleasant-faced little black-
haired irish girl she occupied the same
seat at every fight accompanied by a
young man about her own age who
looked like her brother and she watched
closely seeming to follow tommys
fortunes with interest and applauding
in a manner half enthusiastic half bash-
ful

 when this had gone on for some
three or four battles tommy ventured
to look directly at her between two
rounds and finding her looking at him
he dared a grin to his utter confusion


fight stories

she smiled and nodded in return
whereat he turned away overwhelmed

  who you grinning at ape de-
manded mike following the direction of
tommys eyes that skirt in the blue
dress  can it dumb-bell can it pay
attention to what youre doing r this
goldmans going to knock you for a
row of loops

  but tommy was so inspired by that
smile by the fact that a good-looking
girl had noticed him that he knocked
mr goldman if not for a row of loops
at least for the count of ten the in-
fluence of a good woman can lift even
a pork-and-beaner above himself

  later on the way home tommy
casually remarked

  i wonder who she is  he was not
conscious of speaking aloud but mike
picked up the words

  still thinking about that fluff he
inquired with a slight sneer can it
kid can it you wanta keep off n the
dames theyre worse for a fighter than
booze r hop forget em theyll
grab your coin run you ragged and
spill you in the ash-can theres been
morell one good fighter tucked away
in the cuckoo cage on account o the
janes you leave em be

  not giving much credence to mikes
words tommy said nothing but a few
days later while buying some handker-
chiefs ill the five-and-ten he found
himself standing near the girl of the
ringside he tried to nerve himself to
speak but couldnt and was turning
away when she happened to turn toward
him and their eyes met she looked for
an instant then smiled a bit doubtfully
and by a tremendous effort of will
tommy succeeded in removing his cap

  he didnt realize it but he looked so
wistful-like a good dog thats trying
hard to understand-that she took pity
on him it may be that she was en-
couraged by the fact that he was more
frightened than she at all events she
smiled again extended her hand blushed
charmingly and said

  its mr dugan isnt it

  yesm babbled tommy thats
me-i mean im him-i mean-well
yesm

  i thought so ive seen you fight a
number of times-my brother takes me
-i feel almost as if wed been intro-
duced

  i-i suppose its not very womanly
to go to the fights but-

  nom agreed tommy i mean
yesm - i mean - well gee why
shouldnt you theres lots o swell
dames goes gee why not

  she flashed him an upward glance
then

  i do love it though and im so
glad to have met you

  yesm i-im pleased to meet your
acquaintance

  she smiled again paid for her pur-
chases and turned to go tommy as-
tounded himself by his daring he
actually fell in beside her and walked
with her from the store the girl
who had been waiting on him looked
after him shrugged her shoulders
and laid his bundle on the shelf behind
her

  hell probly be back for it by and
by she commented

  tommy escorted his lady of the ring-
side to her home where saying good-
bye she invited him to come around and
see her some time if he cared to

  tonight inquired mr dugan who
was nothing if not direct

  she seemed mildly amused at this
prompt acceptance

  im sorry but i have a date for to-
night how about wednesday

  wednesday it is tommy agreed
and dragged at his cap he departed a
trifle intoxicated with emotion

  it may be thought that the lady o
the ringside was somewhat bold for-
ward unladylike but it was far from
being her custom to pick up casual men
the fault if fault there was lay in
tommys exceeding innocence he was
so obviously a nice bashful boy that
there was no possibility of mistaking
him for anything else

chapter iii

the second stage

thus began the second stage in the
epic of tommy dugan fighter for
the first time in his life clothes assumed
a more glorified aspect than mere cover-
ing for the body they became a medium
of decoration and as the boys say
how

  tommy revolved affairs in his mind
that evening and next day when re-
leased from bondage to mike he went
to his mother and asked for fifty dol-
lars mrs dugan immediately threw
four conniption fits but in the end re-
lented

  sure yere a good by tommy she
said and never no bother to me at
all heres yer fifty- she hesitated
a moment tommy by its not for
drink is it

  he assured her that it was for a suit
of clothes and she gave him the money
along with an affectionate love-tap
which would have staggered the ordi-
nary man but only made her son laugh

  tommy then -betook himself to a
clothing store where he collected an out-
fit that would have made solomon in
all his glory look like the last rose of
summer left blooming alone

  tommy had his gorgeousness packed
took it home and two nights later ar-
rayed himself like no lily of the field
that ever was and with all the modest
inconspicuousness of a lighthouse pre-
sented himself at the ladys home

  rose garland received him with a
becoming mixture of shyness and
pleasure introducing him to her father
who kept a small but flourishing grocery
store on a side street and to her mother
the comfortable and pleasant wife of a
small grocer also to her brother jack
who drove a truck and being an ar-
dent patron of sport was staggered by
the honor done the family

  not to drag things out tommy in-
stituted a campaign directed at roses

affections he was not conscious of
doing anything of the sort being at-
tracted to the girl as involuntarily as
the steel is drawn to the magnet at all
events he spent every possible evening
at the garland home eventually being
accepted as roses steady

  her parents were at first inclined to
demur at her intimacy with a prize-
fighter for they held the not uncommon
belief that a fighter is a noisy profane
drunken brawling savage this be-
lief like most ready-made ones is true
in only a very small percentage of
cases the average fighter is a quiet
modest and extremely well-behaved
youth enthusiastic in his profession as
any doctor or minister and far less apt
to engage in miscellaneous brawls than
the ordinary citizen

  this reluctance is partly due to the
fact that fighting is his business and he
doesnt mix business with pleasure
partly to the fear that fighting with bare
knuckles he may injure his hands and
so incapacitate himself for the ring and
partly to a chivalrous feeling that it is
unfair for a trained fighter to attack an
untrained man

  roses family came to understand that
tommy was a respectable citizen pain-
fully shy but polite and respectful to
his elders and he shortly became a wel-
come visitor jack garland to be sure
was hugely puffed up over being on in-
timate terms with a local celebrity and
developed a habit in conversation with
friends of dragging tommys name in
by the ears

  i was talking to tommy dugan last
night- tommy dugan was around
to our house last night and-
tommy dugan was telling me- and
so on until it becamc general knowledge
in at least one of harlows circles that
tommy dugan the fighter was keeping
company with rose garland

about two months after the affair
began tommy was working out
one day in the dugan barn-gymnasium
he had gone through his chest-weighti


fight stories

drill had punched the light bag and
skipped rope and now was shadow-
boxing with an imaginary opponent
under the watchful eye of his fraternal
trainer

  all right said mike suddenly
rest tommy dropped his hands
and began walking about in the tradi-
tional manner of lighters during train-
ing intermissions say burst out
mike whats this i hear about you
running around with a fluff

  tommy colored and kept his eyes on
the floor

  she aint no fluff he objected
shes a swell girl

  banana oil sneered mike the
cynic so are they all till they trim
you take it from me brainless shes
out to roll you

  but tommy shook his head

  you got her wrong mike he as-
sured his brother eagerly she aint
no gold-digger why she wont leave
me spend no money on her at all only
once in a while a soda r a movie r
something like that why i tried to
give her a pin i got up to cohens-
paid six beans for it-and she wouldnt
have it made me take it back and make
cohen cough up and then get her one
at the fivc-and-ten i gotta admit the
ten-cent one dont look so bad neither
no mike you got her wrong she aint
out for the coin

  yeah sneered mike i know bait
thats her game shes out to make
you think shes one o these here in-
nocent young things and when youre
hooked good and plenty-blooie goes
the roll all in a bunch r else shes
fixing to do an altar walk with you
and thats worse yet leave a fighter
get spliced and his wife wtont leave
him fight no more and you aint got
the brains to make a living no other
way this was pure calumny tom-
my was quite intelligent enough to fill
any ordinary job shell be scared
youll get your beauty spoiled you
huh

  it is true that tommys features had

suffered damage this always happens
to the boy who takes one to land one
and his left ear was slightly cauli-
fiowered his nose had been broken and
badly set and his face had the slightly
lumpy appearance which comes from
the thickening of the skin in response
to pounding for all that though it
was not an unattractive face good-
natured friendliness counts for more
than the regular features and smooth
complexion of a movie he-doll

  but tommy was concerned neither
with the insult to his looks nor with the
aspersion on his intelligence he was
overcome with embarrassment at the
reference to marriage for this was his
own private pet beautiful dream he
had often imagined himself proposing to
rose he had visioned himself rescuing
her from fire and flood from savage
beasts and yet more savage automobiles
and he had built a picture of himself
winning the championship from the title-
holder while rose sat at the ringside
and cheered him on naive of
course and as lovable a young rascal
as ever was and he flushed crimson
when mike laid a rough finger on this
dream

  you gotta cut it out pursued mike
i aint going to have no women spilling
you now kid youre going up fast
i bet anything you like that another two
yearsll see us holding the title and then
for the big coin see but leave some
dame sink her hooks in you and good-
night  its all off no you gotta shoosh
her off see and do it quick

  but tommy shook his head

  i cant do that mike he answered
it-it wouldnt be right shed think
id just been playing with her-

  ah-r-r park it outside snarled
mike what dyou think i been bring-
ing you along for all these here two
years  aint you got no ambition 
dont you want to get nowheres  here
i been working with you training you
getting good bouts for you going to
the mat with rosenthal prying more
coin outa him stepping you up from a
sons of sock



pork-and-beaner to the main bouts
working in your corner every time you
go on leaving you bat me around in
training making you the big drawing
card at the armory shaping you up for
a go at the title doing all that for you
-and now just because a girl makes
eyes at you you talk about taking a
run-out powder on me well you just
aint so count ten over that one i
got two years invested in you and you
aint going to dump me now

  i aint taking no run-out powder
tommy defended himself what if i
should- he gulped -should marry
her  theres lots o married guys
fighting

  yeah and what good are they
look em over and pick me out the ones
that counts leave a fighter get spliced
and right away his wife gets cold feet
no matter how much a fan she was be-
fore and he either retires r else goes
to pot maybe both and i aint go-
ing to have you doing neither one nor
the other see  i got too much at stake
you gotta shake this here girl o yourn
and do it now

but tommy was obstinate and the
discussion ended in mikes put-
ting  the gloves for the daily work-
out and giving his brother a neat shel-
lacking

  mike was by far the quicker of the
two and was a clever boxer and though
he could not drop tommy whose rug-
gedness and ability to take punishment
were fast becoming proverbial among
harlows sporting element nevertheless
he landed a thousand stinging jabs and
hooks blacked both of tommys eyes
bloodied his nose puffed his lips and
opened a cut over the left cheekbone
nor could tommy land one of the solid
punches that would have curled mike
up like a snake with the colic

  there grunted the older brother
when the bout was over he stepped
back and surveyed his handiwork with
grim satisfaction talk back to me
vill you take that pan and show it to

your girl-you wont have to give her
the air shell give it to you

  it will be observed that in this entire
discussion mike had not stressed tom-
mys welfare he was not thinking of
that he was thinking wholly and ex-
clusively of his own

  tommy however steadfastly declined
to give the desired promise usually sub-
missive to his brothers orders in this
matter he developed a firmness which
might have been the envy of gibraltar
the pyramids and other objects noted
for stability of character

  mike accustomed to obedience and
taking it for granted that his in-
structions would be carried out was
highly incensed when lie learned that
this was not being done and one eve-
ning followed tommy to roses home

  emitting sounds expressive of anger
he walked in on tommy and rose
poured several crates of verbal rasp-
berries  the formers head and or-
dered him home rose promptly flew
to defend her inarticulate caller and a
delightful oratorical battle ensued with
rose the victor for once in his life
mike was out-talked marveling at this
phenomenon he came off the boil took
a chair and spent the evening chatting
with rose while tommy sat and
listened

  this was the first of many evenings
that the invader passed with the other
two briefly mike found himself as
much taken with rose as tommy was
-there is no denying that she was an
attractive youngster-and lie spread
himself to make her like him not with-
out success

  he was a smooth talker was clever
enough to talk about her rather than
himself and in a good cause could spend
money without apparent pain

  he managed to date her up for a
number of occasions without tommy
but he was wise enough to know that
abusing the kid would do himself no
good with rose so he spoke well of him
when absent and when tommy was
one of the party he did not as was his


fight stories

custom treat the younger hoy like an
imbecile chimpanzee on the contrary
he was reasonably polite and considerate
so tommy found himself torn between
jealousy and pleasure on the one hand
he feared and resented the invasion but
on the other it was delightful to have
mike of whom he was genuinely fond
treating him like a human being

  as for rose she treated both boys
exactly alike sat between them at the
movies insisted that tommy go along
when mike proposed a trip to the ar-
cadia amusement park and showed ab-
solutely  preference she was unfail-
ingly and uniformly nice to both

  she did discriminate to the extent of
dancing oftener with mike for when it
came to the light fantastic tommy
owned two left feet but she made up
for it by sitting as close as possible to
tommys corner when he fought and
cheering loudly at every success no
she was not a coquette she was just a
young happy healthy girl who liked a
good time

      chapter iv
      some pickings

six or eight months went by in this
fashion with tommy going on
every fortnight at the armory and with
mike gradually working his prices
higher and higher until the dugan
brothers were drawing down  a
fight and their mother the envy of her
set was driving a sedan of a popular
but inexpensive make

  isidor rosenthal knew his business
and tommy dugan was the best draw-
ing card he had the s r o sign was
out every time he fought for tommy
not only gave a good show but shared
the gift of personal appeal with jack
dempsey babe ruth and other no-
tables

  there was something fascinating
about his good-humored grin his
chunky body his queer shuffling gait

his absolute concentration on the job
his obvious love for the game and
even the fellows whom he beat liked
him for he was utterly free from any
touch of animosity or meanness and
was genuinely distressed if one of them
was hurt though he never pulled his
punches on that account

  one day early in may mike came to
his brother with an announcement

  listen he said i got you
matched with sailor parker what
kayoed rocco bianchi and you know
what that means tommy blinked at
him snap out of it domeless first
place i jacked rosenthal up to paying
sixteen yards for the go-double what
we been getting next place hes go-
ing to have the guy whats matchmaker
for the garden there and if we win
well get to go on over there not in
the main bouts at first o course but
its a starter and some pickings kid
some pickings and all that means you
gotta train like you never done before

  im always in shape tommy of-
fered

  yeh for these palookas you been
meeting listen sap this go is for
twelve rounds and you aint never gone
that distance-

  ive gone ten

  yeh and its them two extra rounds
what spills a lotta guys you didnt
see no sense in training for four when
you knew you could dump the guy in
two but i made you do it and look
what it done for you when you met bart
shaughnessy next place this sailor
guys the toughest baby youve gone up
against yet that boys fast and tough
and he can hit and dont you think he
cant he aint never been kayoed yet
even the champ couldnt flatten him
and there aint many holds decisions
over him neither believe me dumb-
bell youre going to train and i dont
mean maybe j

  mike spoke the truth he put tommy
through the stiffest course of sprouts
the latter had ever met road-work
rope-skipping bag-punching shadow-
sons of sock



boxing working out with sparring part-
ners-mike loosened up and hired three
tough prelim boys for this occasion-
tommy went through them all and in
spite of driving him so mike did not
make the mistake so many inexperienced
trainers stumble over of letting his
principal go stale

  watching like a hawk he eased off
in time for he seemed to know by in-
stinct when tommy would be on edge
and stopped just short of letting him go
over an occasional cigarette or ice-
cream soda or trip to an amusement
park-these and other things brought
tommy to the big night in as perfect
physical condition as any human being
ever knew

  whatever else one might say about
mike he was a born genius at train-
ing and this fact was recognized be-
yond the limits of harlow unknown
to mike some of the big men in the
game had been watching his work with
tommy considering the possibilities in
case he should decide to move up

  in this work of preparation tom-
mys imperturbable nature helped vastly
for he seldom worried his mind was
almost always at ease this was partly
due to his unemotional make-up and
partly to a resolve he had taken he
had for a time been bothered over
mikes attentions to rose but he had
reached a decision that set aside this
worry his share of the purse would
be eight hundred dollars there would
be more coming in eight hundred dol-
lars a fortnight was twenty thousand
eight hundred a year-and his mother
had a bit saved up so tommy had
decided on a momentous step-contin-
gent on his beating the sailor he was
going to ask rose to marry him

this resolution cost him no little
debate but when once it was taken
it was firmly taken and he set about
composing his speech of proposal and
this occupied what time he had left from
his training kept his mind busy and
prevented any possible worry over the

bout from creeping in nor strangely
enough did it cause him any worry of
another sort he was no egotist but he
was so deeply in love with rose that it
never occurred to him that he might
fail he could not conceive of an af-
fection so deep as his not meeting a re-
sponse and his only concern was to ex-
press himself in language worthy of the
girl he adored

  a lover is proverbially humble and
dubious of his chances and it may seem
odd that tommy was so confident still
it is the truth and the oddest thing
about it is that his confidence was wholly
lacking in conceit it was the child-like
simplicity of a one-track mind but
there it was let him win from sailor
parker and just as sure as the sun
comes up in the morning he was going
to ask rose to marry him

  theyd have a home somewhere on
the edge of town and a bit of a lawn
and a litle garden in back and a car
and a couple of kids and hed come
home and turn his purses over to her
and shed keep the house and theyd
be happy all their lives gee itd be
grand

in this spirit he proceeded to the
armory on the great night mike
would be handling him jack garland
would be in his corner-a great honor
for jack who appreciated it fully-and
rose would be just outside the ring
and when the fight was over rosenthal
would hand mike  and mike
would give him half and then-

  at five minutes after ten one of the
runners of the harlow sporting club
stuck his head in the dressing-room
door saying

  lets go tommy barnatos got
wilson pretty well softened up he
wont last moren another round
tommy slid off the rubbing-table
gathered his bathrobe about him and
started out a roar from the crowd
notified him that wilson was through
and with mike and jack at his elbows
he moved briskly down the aisle the


fight stories

beaten fighter supported by his han-
dlers passed them his head lolling
weakly from side to side and mike
grinned at the spectacle

  thats the way theyll be taking
parker out in a few minutes he said
jerking his thumb toward wilson and
tommy nodded his eyes full of pity

  the ring the white faces shading off
into obscurity the glare of light on the
canvas the gray haze of tobacco smoke
the bandages tape and gloves-all these
were an old story to tommy dugan and
he glanced about him passing over them
indifferently to look for the bright face
and smooth black hair of rose there
she was in her usual place and he
nodded and smiled at her feeling a curi-
ous thrill as she nodded and smiled in
return when this was over- but the
referee was beckoning the fighters to
the center and tommy and mike went
forward to meet parker and his man-
ager this too was old stuff

  -and make it clean and hard con-
cluded the official tommy had spent
the time in sizing up his opponent rather
than in listening to what he knew by
heart

  back in the corner mike stripped off
the bathrobe saying

  now mind this guys clever and he
can hit you gotta keep forcing him all
the time try to box him and your
names mush you gotta fight him
keep after him all the time and dont
give him no chance to get set see 

  tommy nodded he had heard this a
million times

  clang

the sailor was as different from
tommy as could be half a head
taller smooth-muscled lithe active his
handsome face unmarked by blows he
was the ideal of a fast and skillful
boxer but there was in his features none
of the good nature that distinguished
tommy dugan thin-lipped hawk-
nosed with hard gray eyes it was a
cruel face

  beautifully put together he stepped

forward with the easy grace of a dancer
and coming within range he planted a
straight left on tommys forehead it
was aimed for the nose but went a trifle
high the glove landed with a smack
and a short barking yell came from the
crowd but tommy only grinned that
sort of thing could never hurt

  ducking his head tommy rushed but
the sailor danced easily away landing a
quick one-two as he went and tommys
head rocked under the blows but they
also were high and did no harm and he
rushed again taking two and landing
none this time the sailor had got the
range and connected with tommys
nose and jaw

  and so it went tommy trying always
to work in to close quarters the sailor
keeping always out of range of those
lethal fists and wearing tommy down
with sharp stinging blows none of
which taken singly did any perceptible
damage but whose cumulative effect was
weakening

  a hundred times tommy drove in
straight lefts and rights swung sav-
agely tried hooks and jabs but always
his blows were taken on glove or elbow
or passed a head which ducked barely
enough to let the fist go by and ever
those stinging blows to the face those
sharp rib-tearing hooks to the body
those paralyzing hooks or swings to the
heart

  by the end of the eighth it was clear
to all that the bout could end in only one
fashion parker would keep on strong
as ever gradually softening the rugged
tommy until the latter was too weak to
land a damaging blow and then he
would tear in measure his man and
drop him the unbeatable iron man was
on his way mike sponged tommy with
ice-water massaged him kept up a
steady stream of encouraging words

  youre doing fine kid keep after
him youll get him one socks
enough to do the business stay with
him but somehow mikes voice
sounded perfunctory he didnt really
seem to mean what he said-funny
sons of sock



that did mike think the sailor was

going to win

  and with that a suspicion crept into
tommys mind that all was not well
maybe this guy was too fast for him
too clever and how he could sock
that last one over the liver-gee how
that hurt hed felt his knees sag when
that blow landed his face was all
puffy looking down his nose it seemed
as big as a house and his right eye
was all bunged up he could hardly sec
out of it he couldnt get home on the
sailor-hadnt landed a dozen punches
 him all evening and he was going
away when those got there no tommy
dugan himself was being taken for a
ride

  tommy could feel himself growing
weak there was no steam in his
punches his gloves weighed a ton his
feet had lead shoes on them he could
hardly step around and he knew the
agony that comes to a fighter when his
body worn down by repeated assaults
no longer responds to the fiery will that
urges him on but he must keep going
-no quitting-go down game and try-
ing to the very end

  he turned his head and glanced at
rose mike was whispering something
in her ear and she was laughing   
was she laughing at him no not
rose she wouldnt ever do that there
was the boy carrying around a placard
with a huge  on it four more
rounds to go-the gong

many of the spectators were leav-
ing some few because they hated
to see a game fighter pounded without
mercy but most because the conclusion
was foregone no sense in waiting to see
the end it wouldnt be long now
tommy was weakening fast he could
never stay the limit

  about the middle of the tenth the
sailor drove in to attack to finish dugan
off he rushed tommy to the ropes
swung right and left to the jaw and
tommy went down

  resting on hands and knees half

stunned he shook his head to clear it
vaguely like the roar of a distant cata-
ract he heard the shouting of the crowd 
before his eyes he saw a patch of can-
vas and above the distant roar he heard
someone counting one thought per-
sisted in his dazed mind beaten he
could not ask rose to marry him why
this should be he could not have told
but he had determined to come to her
victorious

  he drew a long and shuddering
breath groped blindly for the ropes
caught them dragged himself to his
knees he could see the white-clad
referee one arm swinging in time to the
count lie could see the face of the
sailor a cruel sneer on his lips and that
was all the great crowd might have
been a thousand miles away for all he
knew of them

  eight

  with a mighty effort tommy hoisted
himself to his feet stood facing the tiger
that flashed across the ring for the final
blow

  the difference between a novice and
an experienced workman is never more
clearly shown than when delivering a
knockout confronting a helpless man
one who is out on his feet the beginner
rushes in with a wild flurry of blows he
is over-eager and punishes his man un-
necessarily-sometimes even fails en-
tirely and lets him recover but the
craftsman measures his victim with a
light straight blow then steps in with
one quick and merciful punch

  sailor parker was old and wise in the
ring but tonight lie was over-confident
this was only a trifling battle out in the
sticks and this guy was a set-up com-
ing in with his guard down he left an
opening and tommy called up the last
flicker of his vitality stepped suddenly
forward and drove in a terrific right-
hand uppercut that took the sailor full
and square at the base of the breast-
bone

  that tremendous blow picked the
sailor clear of the canvas and slammed
him gasping and writhing on the floor


fight stories

and with a roar that shook the build-
ing the amazed crowd greeted the vic-
tor no need to wait the count it was
ten full minutes before the sailors sec-
onds could get their man to his dressing-
room

      chapter v
      a new deal

stretched out on the rubbing-
table tommy submitted to the
sponging and massage that jack gave
him he was tired very tired and sore
all over but his young strength was
coming back under jacks manipulation

  im going to collect from rosen-
thal said mike and disappeared while
tommy completely relaxed grunted
assent

  after a time

  o k said jack slip into your
clothes tommy gosh what a fight
and that last wallop pow and
down goes the sailor some battle ill
say so-ome battle ill bet they havent
got the dust out of his nose yet i won-
der where mike is hes been gone
most half an hour

  battling with rosenthal most like
tommy rejoined as he began to dress

  but still no mike appeared and at
length the two went in search of him
invading rosenthals office

  why i paid him off before the fight
started said that worthy in surprise
 s funny maybe lies gone on home
but its queer he wouldnt wait why
not call up and see and he pushed
the telephone across the desk to tommy
who called up his home

  mike answered mrs dugan
sure lies not home yet isnt he with
you howd the fight come out tommy
by ye won of course

  oh sure kayo in the tenth you
sure mikes not home

 certain sure are ye coming
along 

  be there in a few minutes and

hanging up he turned to the others and
shook his head

  maybe hes taken rose home jack
offered gimme the phone he called
the number hey mom he asked
is rose home yet  you sure
   well look in her room will you
she might have got in without your
knowing it    yeh ill hold the wire
a long silence then what say that
again will you    gosh    all

and turned to tommy his face full of
concern shes run off with mike
left a note to say they were married
this afternoon andve caught the eleven
oclock rattler for chicago hes got a
job helping condition battling clark for
his go with the champ tommy shes
ditched you the little-

  but tommys upraised hand stopped
him the fighters dream was in ruins
but no one must say a word against
rose

  for a time there was silence in the
office then tommy got to his feet he
was sick heart-broken he felt as though
that solar plexus punch had landed on
him instead of on the sailor but he
mustnt let anyone see it that is the first
and fundamental article of the fighters
creed never to let anyone know how
much you are hurt

  and thats that he said so long
rosenthal see you again

  ill walk home with you offered
jack following him from the building
but tommy refused

  id rather be alone he said

  o k if thats the way you feel
jack assented doubtfully see you
tomorrow 

  sure come around in the p m
  but still jack hesitated

  look here tommy he stumbled
you wont-you wont-

  wont what

  well-do anything-desperate
tommy laughed it was by no means
hearty but it was a laugh

  dont be a fool jack

  and the two friends separated
sons of sock



tommy did not go directly home
instead he walked out to the park
where he sat down on one of the benches
and stared idly dully at the lake
bruised sore and weary still he felt
the pain of his body far less than the
agony of his soul rose false to him
rose a deceiver but do her justice he
held no promise from her but mike-
ah that was harder to bear oh god
knew which was worse mike his
brother whom he trusted and admired
was a traitor a crook-had betrayed
him had stolen his money and his girl

  the dream was a false one there
would be no little home with a garden
and a couple of kids no rose to sit at
the ringside when he fought a great
sob tore his throat and something
choked him his brother was gone his
money was gone his girl was gone-
what was left for him

  he stared at the quiet water at his
feet and jacks suggestion came to his
mind-he wondered how it would feel
to walk out deeper and deeper until
the lake closed over his head gave him
peace from the misery that racked him
so he blinked and two round tears
trickled out from under his eyelids
rolled down his cheeks

  angry he dashed them away with the
back of his hand what if he was alone
a fighter crying like some little kid
but his eyes filled again blurring the
lights on the water and he fixed his
gaze winking to drive away that child-
ish moisture

  he stared long and fixedly and grad-
ually the dancing lights reflected from
the surface steadied took form from
the water there slowly rose a vast arena
hazy in outline blazing with lights and
now he was inside and the building was
cloudy with smoke through which he
could make out thousands and thousands
of men and women close-packed in one
huge crowd sharper and clearer it
grew and all those thousands were on
their feet shouting waving their arms
in the center was a raised platform
fenced about with ropes floored with

white canvas and on the canvas lay the
crumpled figure of a man over whom
bent another figure counting and now
he tommy dugan was standing inside
the ropes leaning against them and
vague forms were lifting the uncon-
scious man carrying him away now
the referee was raising tommys arm
and saying something he could not
make out what was said but he could
see the officials mouth shape the words
champion of the world

  slowly the vision faded and again
tommy was sitting on the park bench
but now he was leaning forward fists
clenched muscles tense eyes glowing
he rose drew a long breath relaxed
looked up at the stars his money was
gone his brother was gone his girl was
gone-yes but there still was left-the
game

a certain gentleman has com-
mented on the existence of a tide
in the affairs of men which taken at the
flood leads on to fortune and such a
tide must have been waiting for tommy
dugan

  the morning after his fight with
parker he was roused by his mother
who announced a visitor

  who is it demanded tommy

  sure and i dunno came the reply
all i can tell ye is that he looks like a
cross between a million dollars and a
polecat will i be after telling him to
come back later

  no ill be right down and tom-
my hoisted himself a bit painfully out
of bed

  entering the modest parlor of the
dugan home tommy realized that it
was the visitors clothing which had in-
spired the first part of mrs dugans
description and his face which had pro-
voked the latter

  blindingly dressed and decorated like
a christmas tree with diamonds of the
sort that look best by artificial light the
stranger carried features strongly sug-
gesting a weasels narrow with small
eyes of a peculiar green thin nose and


fight stories

close-pinched lips and with lines deeply
graved from nose to mouth it was a
face which though it could scarcely
be called handsome yet spoke clearly of
shrewdness and force of character
tommy was impressed by the others
evident wealth and assured manner

  mr dugan began the stranger
my card

  taking the pasteboard tommy read
j w moulton manager of tommy
kid gordon battling buford young
joe gans one-punch donlon and
many others too numerous to men-
tion

  thats me the caller went on
j w moulton mostly called lop-
ear on account o this with a fore-
finger he indicated a badly cauliflowered
left ear well to business i hear
your manager took a run-out powder on
you last night tommy nodded as
moulton paused inquiringly well
then how about signing up with me
and grabbing yourself off some jack
as you see i got a stable o fighters
and i seen you fight last night and with
good management youd ought to go
over big

  i got connections with the garden
and i can get you on there not right
away maybe-we got to build you up
first-but before too long

  and im willing to give you my
persnal guarantee that inside o three
years youll be up in the top flight

   wont promise you the title be-
cause i aint abslutely sure and i dont
never promise unless i know i can per-
form but i will guarantee that if you
aint chanup youll at least be challenger
and theres more jack in that than in
fighting for izzy rosenthal at the
armory and getting the works from a
crooked manager

  and i wont say you mightnt get to
be champ at that i got my suspicions
even if i aint willing to abslutely guar-
antee it

  well what say

  he produced a paper and a fountain
pen thirty-three and a thirds my

cut i aint like some o these here rob-
bers what grabs all they can get i take
what the law gives me and no more
you sign right here he spread the
paper on the table thrust the pen into
tommys hand and pointed to the
famous dotted line

  two of the neighbors were hastily
summoned for witnesses and tommy
hypnotized by the forceful mr moul-
ton signed away body and soul for the
term of ten years

  there is this to be said for lop-ear
moulton he lived up to his promise
no one knew better than he the dark
and devious ways of the questionable
promoters managers and fighters who
to the regret of all clean sportsmen
sometimes defile a good game or of sell-
ers of fake oil-stocks and the other para-
sites who are always on the lookout for
easy money it was little use for anyone
to attempt trickery when lop-ear was
on watch he protected his boys

  without pinning no bokays on my-
self he told tommy dugan if i do
say it a guys got to be pretty cagey to
hand me the runaround and i dont let
nobody rob the boys in my stable

chapter vi

the black sheep

tommy profited by the new ar-
rangement and did well for moul-
ton got him on at the garden which the
fighter found not unlike his vision of
that memorable night save for the haze
of smoke at first of course it was
only as a prelim boy but in two years
tommy rose to the dignity of the semi-
final and was doing far better finan-
cially than with rosenthal in fact as
a drawing card he sometimes outshone
the principals he could always be de-
pended on to make a fight of it

  tommy found that to do justice to his
public it was necessary for him to live in
new york so he got a cheap room near
moultons gymnasium and kept pretty
sons of sock



much in trim all the time occasionally
for an important bout he put the finish-
ing touches  at a training camp some
thirty miles out of the city up in the
hills

  whenever possible he spent week-
ends with his mother of course and
equally of course he turned over to her
to use for herself or to save for him all
his earnings except bare living expenses
moulton encouraged him to save and he
was never a spendthrift so he gradually
accumulated a nice little bank account

  for a final touch he managed to ac-
quire under lop-ears instruction
some slight knowledge of boxing he
never rivalled young griffo or packy
macfarland-not by several million
miles-but he did at least learn that a
glove stuck out in front of a fighter will
sometimes save a knockout that the el-
bows should be kept close to the body
when infighting and that a straight left
besides breaking up an opponents at-
tack does more damage in the long run
than a roundhouse swing

  so two years slipped by with tommy
slowly but surely advancing in his
chosen profession till one day moulton
came into the gym in an unusually
cheerful mood he was never one to
show depression but this day he was
fairly bubbling over with good cheer

  ignoring the other fighters who were
going through their daily routine of ex-
ercise he marched over to where tom-
my was working out with the heavy bag
and slapped the youngster on the back
tommy turned around and grinned
pleasantly he was fond of his manager

  kid said moulton lay off o that
and give three loud cheers

  what about demanded the phleg-
matic tommy

  ive got ace warren for you

  yeh

  yeh and then again yeh s at all
you can say yeh dyou realize
what it means do you or do you
snap out of it

  hes a good man replied tommy
soberly

  my gosh lop-ear flung up his
hands in mock despair my good gosh
and little pussy-cats here i go to
work and get you a big shot and all you
can say is yeh hes a good man
sure hes a good man  if he wasnt we
wouldnt want him would we

  can you beat it lop-ear appealed
to the others who were listening by this
time listen kid while i put it in
words of one cylinder for you buster
mcgowan holds the title johnny
campis the leading contender and ace
warrens fought three times with campi
-won one lost one and drew one
beat ace that puts us in line for a go
with campi beat campi and we get to
go on with the champ

  or we might even jump over campi
at that such things has happened s
at plain or do i have to send you
over to bellevue and let the sawbones
oprate  you to get the idea through
the concrete

  oh i get you said tommy but
suppose ace beats me

  moulton dropped his hands in dis-
gust

 suppose you break a leg he
snorted suppose you get run over by
a truck suppose you jump off the
dock and forget to come up and i
wouldnt put that past you neither he
added darkly he really liked tommy
more than a little it was merely his cus-
tom to pour raspberries on his pet
fighter

  anyway he continued you get to
go on in the finals at the garden and
we meet tomorrow p m to sign ar-
ticles kid this heres one big chance
you got to train like you never done be-
fore

  all right agreed tommy say i
think im getting this feint to the head
and left hook to the body better watch
will you  and he turned again to the
bag

the following afternoon lop-ear
escorted tommy down town to the
lawyers office and two or three minutes


fight stories

after they got there ace warren with
his manager and trainer came in

  warren was a duplicate of tommy in
build-short stocky and broad of shoul-
der-but his face lacked the genial
dugan friendliness being tough brutal
and savage

  he was not in the ring for money
nor yet because he liked fighting he was
there because he loved to hurt people
and in the ring he could gratify this de-
sire without penalty that he got paid
for it was a gratifying but wholly minor
incident and that he sometimes had to
take punishment was no deterrent but
merely inflamed his savage disposition

  there are not many fighters of this
sort but there are a few and ace war-
ren was one of the most noted of them
it would be gross flattery to call him a
gorilla the gorilla might if not angered
show some faint indications of a sense
of pity but warren never it follows
as day follows night that warren like
tommy was a rushing two-handed
take-one-to-land-one fighter though for
a very different reason

  warren who hated all mankind
grunted something which might by a
stretch of the imagination be considered
a greeting and tommy answered pleas-
antly then looked at the others dis-
covering to his vast astonishment that
the trainer was none other than michael
dugan mike grinned cheerfully came
over to his brother and stuck out his
hand saying

  hello kid hows tricks

  by all the rules tommy should have
taken a punch at his brother but he
could no more hold rancor than a sieve
can hold water and in the past two
years his anger against mike had largely
evaporated so he grinned in return and
answered

  fine mike hows everything with
you 

  fine as frogs hair in august the
old lady o k 

  o k sure hows- tommy
hesitated a little-hows rose

  mike laughed indifferently

  i dunno he replied i aint seen
her in a year and a half

  she isnt- a horrible fear gripped
tommy by the throat-she isnt   
dead

  mike laughed again

  not so far as i know but i ditched
her we didnt live together but about
six months and then i give her the air
she was too slow for me no pep her
notion of a whale of an evening was to
sit around the house and read a book
and go to bed spend the evening
watching the clock go round a swell
way to live one o these here home-
bodies what i mean so i give her the
gate she wrote to me a couple o
times but i never paid  atten-
tion last i heard she was back in
harlow and had got a divorce or some-
thing

  tommy was conscious of a fearful
a terrible rage that welled up within
him such a blinding fury as he had
never known before mike had only
injured him but now he had hurt rose
-and spoke of it with utter callousness
but before he could get set to leap on
his brother his slow-moving mind was
diverted by the lawyers voice summon-
ing him to sign the articles and the
office missed a battle for which many a
promoter would have paid good money

all that afternoon and evening
tommy was in a deep study he
wanted to maul his brother to injure
him to tear him to pieces but after all
that seemed inadequate-it wouldnt
hurt mike enough and for the first
time in his life tommy became crafty
showed a knowledge of human psy-
chology and developed a plan of re-
venge deeper than mere physical harm

  that was on friday on monday
tommy presented himself according to
custom at the gym where he requested
a private interview with his manager
in moultons office tommy gave lop-
ear a certified check saying

  listen i want you to bet this on
me
sons of sock



  moulton examined the slip of paper
then whistled

  fourteen grand say kid are you
cuckoo thats most of what youve
got soaked away aint it

  all of it and that aint all i want
i want you should take my share of the
purse-three thousand aint it-and
bet that too get me the best odds you
can and lookit dont just go around
betting it with anybody i want you to
bet it with my brother he wont want
to bet that much but youre cagey you
can talk him into it talk it up to him
strong and you can make him do it
lop-ear grinned he remembered the
old story he had heard the conversation
in the lawyers office and he saw in-
stantly what was in tommys mind
tommy confirmed the guess saying

  i want to clean him out

  swell said moulton but how
about if ace wins wholl be cleaned
out then

  tommy stared

  i thought you was sure id take
ace he queried and moulton
shrugged

  i am-practically but there aint
nothing dead sure in this world only
death and taxes as the saying goes
oh well responded tommy philo-
sophically its a chance we got to take
you cant break eggs without making an
omelet can you 

  ill say you can snorted lop-ear
look here kid-

  but all argument all dissuasion were
futile tommys mind was set and al-
though that mind functioned slowly
once made up it continued on its way
with appalling definiteness so lop-
ear took the check and some days later
reported

  i got it all down he said got you
six to five its all down in aces stable
but your brother couldnt take only fif-
teen grand and he had to go plumb to
the bottom of his sock to do that ace
took the other two himself

  but tommy was not interested in de-
tails

    fight-sept-

  then mikell be cleaned he asked
if we win moulton pointed out
if ace takes you for a ride itll be an-
other dugan thatll be cleaned

  oh yeh replied tommy vaguely
well i guess i better get to work

chapter vii

square shooters always

the evening of the battle saw the
garden packed from ringside to
roof this fight was a natural and
further both men were known to be
tough battlers thered be no waltzing
match when they came together the
fans knew it would be a slam-bang rip-
snorting fight from start to finish with
an excellent chance of someone being
flattened and they turned out in thou-
sands with that hope

  tommy was first in the ring and
waited no more than a minute for his
opponent ace was always eager to get
to work and the roar that greeted tom-
mys appearance was still echoing when
it was renewed for warren this was
not a title bout so the preliminaries
were quickly run through and the fight-
ers with their managers and seconds
joined the referee for instructions

  heres where you walk home talk-
ing to yourself kid mike jeered at
his brother that is if you can walk
at all after ace gets through with
you

  tonnny was never quick at repartee
his notion was to say it with fists

  yeh he returned you go roll a
hoop will you 

but mike only laughed insultingly

  gentlemen gentlemen warned the
referee and sent them to their corners
to await the gong

  with the sound ace warren shot
from his corner across the ring and
met tommy who hesitated not a sec-
ond and with heads down and fists
working the two got to business bring-
ing the crowd to their feet delirious


fight stories

witli joy before the round was half
over

  it was a thrilling battle to watch-a
hard slashing fight from gong to gong
no dancing-party no hit-and-run affair
but a desperate battle of bludgeon
against bludgeon victory to rest with
the stouter club

  by the end of the seventh both men
were battered but ace warren had
taken the worst of the exchange his
left eye was closed his mouth was
puffed and cut and a great bruise
slowly turning purple extended clear
across his stomach and from belt line
to ribs

 tommy on the other hand was
scarcely marked about the body-thanks
to keeping his elbows close-and though
his face was bruised his eyes were both
wide open and he could still gauge his
distances perfectly

 in the fourth tommy was half
knocked half pushed through the ropes
smashing a typewriter in his fall in the
sixth warren went down only to
bounce immediately to his feet and re-
new the attack aside from these there
had been no knockdowns

  but warrens worst injury was to his
disposition he was taking a beating
and he knew it and his savage venom-
ous temper was looking for someone to
take it out  during the rest between
the seventh and eighth an altercation
broke out in warrens corner and
tommy his ears cocked heard the
fighter say

  a fine dub of a trainer you are git
outa here go on get away from me
youre fired come near me again and
ill sock you

  aces manager attempted some re-
monstrance drawing from the fighter a
stream of abuse that sent the referee in
a hurry to that corner to remind the
choice mr warren that there were
ladies present

  pull anything more like that and
ill duck you out of the ring and have
the cops take you for a ride he
warned

  thereafter warren merely growled
under his breath but tommy noted that
mike no longer went near the fighter
he crouched just outside the ring and
his face grew longer and longer more
and more strained as he saw his cher-
ished dollars slipping away

  the end came in the eleventh and
with surprising abruptness warren
had been taking a thorough beating but
he was still strong and the spectators
mad with delight had about concluded
that it would go to a decision when ace
warren staggered out of a flurry of
blows and rocked unsteadily on his feet
his left side toward tommy

 instantly tommy drove home a
straight right to the angle of the jaw
the full thrust of his powerful back and
legs behind it and warren crashed full-
length to the floor where he squirmed
and twisted in an effort to rise tommy
retired to a corner where he leaned
against the ropes while the referee bent
over ace shouting the count to make
himself heard above the roar that filled
the garden

  but warren was game savage and
brutal though he wras lie lacked nothing
in courage he got to hands and knees
rested there shaking his head to clear
it and at the count of nine was on his
feet utterly helpless tottering hands
down held erect only by his fighting
heart tommy started toward him then
stopped and looked at the referee the
official caught tommys wrist lifted his
glove for an instant and motioned war-
rens seconds to take the beaten man
away

the following afternoon tommy
and his manager were closeted in
the latters office moulton was figur-
ing on a bit of paper

  your own fourteen grand he said
what you give me and your share of
the purse three grand thats seventeen
and at six-to-five you win twenty
grand four yards thats altogether
thirty-seven thousand four hundred you
got coming to you a nice evenings

was it-and hand it over to her

  will she take it asked the skepti-
cal moulton

  not from me she wouldnt no and
thats where you got to be cagey take
it to her yourself and say it comes from

her husband tell any kind o fairy
story you can think up but see that she
takes it it ought to be easy for you-
you could sell ear-muffs in the desert
o sarah and maybe it wont burn
mike up when he hears about it
christmas hell be fit to be tied
moulton put his head back and
laughed aloud then sobering down he
rose and solemnly extended his hand

   kid he said thats sure complete
broke out of a job and the twenty
thousand you took away from him going
to the wife he ditched boy ill tell the
cock-eyed world youve got one grand
idea of revenge and continued
moulton theres the other side of the
picture i aint forgettin either they
dont all come all wool and a coupla
yards wide shake

  there was a catch in the managers
voice and a mistiness in his eyes as their
hands clasped in a grip of understand-
ing between two square-shooters

a bit of godfrey strategy

odd things happen in the ring now and then according to a chicago
paper one of them occurred recently to george godfrey king pin of the
colored heavyweights the report is that big george was putting on a battle
incognito george it seems has to do that now and then as he is such a
terror in the ring that few of the top-notch heavyweights will take him on
so to get fights he has to take on third and fourth-raters this is all right
with george he is not exclusive knowing what a terror he is however
the third and fourth-raters decline to get into the ring with him if they
know who he is hence the incognito

   the boxer george was meeting in the bout referred to was a husky col-
ored lad not knowing georges real identity he waded into him with zeal
and enthusiasm as godfrey hadnt done any serious training for the bout
he soon found himself having a rough time of it it was a ten-round bout
along about the sixth round george felt he had used up all his available
steam and still his opponent kept charging in with unabated vigor and
enthusiasm going back to his corner at the end of the round george whis-
pered something to one of his seconds

   shortly thereafter an individual entered crying in a loud voice mr
godfrey mr godfrey telegram for mr godfrey

   a startled face reared itself above the flapping towels in the opposite
corner not mr george godfrey said georges opponent

   ya-as boy thats my name godfrey george godfrey drawled the
big colored scrapper

   after this announcement the fight became a foot race with mr godfrey
quite well satisfied to amble around the ring after his lately enthusiastic
opponent taking care never to crowd him too closely or to take any chances
of making him forget his newly acquired respect for the man he was boxing

author of the iron mari

trouble never troubled steve costigan for trouble meant action with a
capital a-and action was what steve craved this time it was honolulu
waterfront cabarets and-guess what-a beautiful girl

the sea girl hadnt been docked
in honolulu moren three hours
before bill obrien come legging
it down to the pool hall where i was
showing mushy hansen the fine points
of the game to tell me that hed got
me matched to fight some has-been at
the american arena that night

  the ruffian is in said bill and
they got a fellow which they swear can
take any man aboard the sea girl to a
royal cleanin i aint seen him but
they say he growed up in the back coun-
try of australia and run wild with the
kangaroos till he was shanghaied aboard
a ship at an early age they say hes
licked everybody aboard the ruffian
from the capll down to the mess boy-
stow the gab and lead me to some
ruffian idjits which is cravin to risk
their jack on this tramp i interrupted
i got a hundred and fifty bucks thats
burn in my pockets up

  well it was easy to find some luna-


tics from the ruffian and after putting
up our money at even odds with a bar-
tender for stakeholder and knowing i
had a tough battle ahead of me and
needed some training i got me a hair-
cut and then went down to the hiber-
nian bar for a few shots of hard licker
while me and bill and mushy was lap-
ping up our drinks in come sven lar-
sen this huge and useless swede has
long been laboring under the hallucina-
tion that he oughta be champion of the
sea girl and  amount of batter-
ing has been able to quite wipe the
idee outa what he supposes to be his
brain

  well this big mistake come up to me
and scowling down at me he said you
irisher put oop your hands

  i set my licker down with a short
sigh of annoyance with a thousand
sailors in port itcliin for a scrap i
said you got to pick on me gwan-
i dont want to light no shipmate now
waterfront fists



anyway i got to fight the ruffians man
in a few hours

  aye shood be fightin him persisted
the deluded maniac aye ought to be
champ of dey sea girl come on you
big stiffer and so saying he squared
off in what he fondly believed was a
fighting pose at this moment my
white bulldog mike sensing trouble
bristled and looked up from the bowl
of beer he was lapping up on the floor
but seeing it was nobody but sven he
curled up and went to sleep

  dont risk your hands on the big
chump steve said bill disgustedly
ill fix him-

  you stay oot of dis bill obrien
said the swede waving his huge fists
around menacingly aye will see to you
after aye lick steve

  aw youre drunk i said a fine
shipmate you are

  aye am not droonk he roared
my girl told me-

  i didnt know you had a girl here
said bill

  well aye have and she said a big
man like me shood be champion of his
ship and she wouldnt have nothings to
do with me till aye was so put oop
your hands-

  aw youre crazy i snapped turn-
ing back to the bar but watching him
close from the corner of my eye which
was a good thing because he started a
wild right swing that had destruction
wrote all over it i side-stepped and
he crashed into the bar rebounding
with a bloodthirsty beller he lunged at
me and seeing they was no arguing
with the misguided heathen i stepped
inside his swing and brought up a right
uppercut to the jaw that lifted his whole
two hundred and forty-five pounds
clean off the floor and stood him on the
back of his neck out cold mike awak-
ened by the crash opened one eye
raised one ear and then went back to
sleep with a sort of gentle canine smile

  y oughta be careful growled bill
while mushy sloshed a pitcher of dirty
water over the swede you mighta

busted yore hand wliynt you hit him
in the stummick

  i didnt wanta upset his stummick
i said ive skinned my knuckles a
little but they aint even bruised much
ive had em in too many buckets uh
brine

at last sven was able to sit up and
cuss me and he mumbled some-
thing i didnt catch

  he says hes got a date with his girl
tonight mushy said but hes ashamed
to go back to her with that welt on his
jaw and tell her he got licked

  ya said sven nibbing his jaw
you got to go tell her i cant come
steve

  aw well i said all right ill tell
her you fell off the docks and sprained
your ankle wheres she live

  she dances at the striped cat cab-
eret said steve

  after downing a finger of old jersey
cream i tightened my belt and me and
mike sauntered forth

  bill followed me out into the street
and said dawg-gone it steve you
ought not to go cruisin off this way
with the fight just a few hours in the
offin that ruffian crew is crooked as
a buncha snakes-and you know what
a soft head you are where women is
concerned

  your remarks is highly insultin
bill i returned with my well-known
quiet dignity i dont reckon no woman
ever made a fool outa me i know em
like a book anyhow you dont think
id fall for a dame as encouraged a sp
like sven do you heck shes prob-
ably some big fat wench with a face like
a bull terrier whatd he say her name
was-oh yes gloria flynn dont you
worry about me ill be at the amer-
ican in plenty uh time

  it was after dark when me and mike
got to the striped cat cabaret which
is located in a tough waterfront section
of the city i asked the manager for
gloria flynn and he said shed just
finished a dance and was in her dress-


fight stories

ing room changing to street clothes
he told me to wait for her at the back
exit which i clone i was standing there
when the door opened and some girls
come out i said taking off my cap
politely which one of you frails is
gloria flynn if any

  you could of knocked me over with
a pile-driver when the snappiest pret-
tiest one of the bunch up and said im
her-and what of it

  well i said eyeing her with great
admiration all i can say is what does
a girl like you want to waste her time
with such tripe as sven larsen when
they is men like me in port

  dont get fresh she snapped

  oh i aint fresh i assured her i
just come to tell you that sven fell off
a dock and broke his neck-i mean
sprained his ankle and he cant make
tho date tonight

  oh she murmured then looking
close at me she said who are you
im steve costigan the fellow that
licked him  replied thoughtlessly

  oh she said kind of breathlessly
so youre steve costigan

  yeah i am  said having spilled
the beans anyway steve costigan
a  mariner and heavyweight cham-
pion aboard the trader sea girl i
knowed you didnt know me or you
wouldnt of persuaded your boy friend
to risk his life by takin a swing at me
she looked kind of bewildered i
dont know what youre talking about
oh its all right i hastened to as-
sure her sven told me about you
urgin him to climb me but its natural
for a frail to want her fellow to be a
champ of somethin what i cant un-
derstand is what you see in a galoot
like sven

  she gave a kind of hysterical laugh
oh i see why mr costigan-
call me steve i beamed

  well-steve she said with a little
embarrassed laugh i didnt urge him
anything of the sort i just said he was
such a big fellow i bet he could whip
anybody aboard his ship-and he said

one of the other sailors steve costigan
was champion and i said i was sur-
prised that anybody could lick him-
sven i mean why i had no idea hed
get it into his head i wanted him to
fight anybody i do hope you didnt
hurt the poor boy

  oh not much i said unconsciously
swelling out my huge chest i always
handle my shipmates easy as possible
though uh course im so powerful
some times i hit hardern i intend to
but say sister i know a swell little girl
like you wasnt takin that big square-
head serious you was just sorry for
him because hes so kind of big and
awkward and dumb wasnt you 
well she admitted that was the
way of it he looked lonesome-
well thats mighty fine of you i
said but forget about him now after
the beltin i give him he wont want to
come back to you and anyway hell
find a native girl or a chinese or some-
thin he aint like me a womans a
woman to him and hell fall for any-
thing in skirts that comes along me
im a one-woman man anyway kid it
aint right for you to trail around with
a galoot like him you owe it to your-
self to keep company with only the best
-me for instance

  maybe youre right she said with
downcast eyes

  sure im always right i answered
modestly now what say we go in and
lap up something all this talkin i been
doins got my throat dry

  oh i never drink intoxicants she
said with a bright smile if you dont
mind lets go over here to this ice-cream
parlor

  o k with me i said but first
iemme introduce you to mike who can
lick his weight both in wildcats and dog
biscuits

  well mike he shook hands with her
but he wasnt particular enthusiastic
he aint no ladies dog he treats em
politely but coldly then we went over
to the joint where they sold ice cream
and while we was dawdling over the
waterfront fists



stuff i let my eyes wander over my
charming companion she was a beauty
no doubt about it curly yellow hair and
big trusting violet eyes

tt hats a nice girl like you do-
vv in workin in a dump like the
striped cat i asked her and she kind
of sighed and hung her head

  a girl has to do lots of things she
dont like to she said i was in a
high class stock company which went
broke here on account of the manager
getting delirium tremens and having to
be sent back to his home in england i
had to eat and this was the only job
open for me some day im going
home my folks live on a dairy farm in
new jersey and i was a fool ever to
leave there right now i can see the
old white farm house and the green
meadows with the babbling brooks run-
ning through them and the cows graz-
ing

  i thought she was going to cry for a
minute then she kind of sighed and
smiled its all in a life-time isnt
it

  youre a brave kid i said touched
to my shoesoles and i wanta see more
of you im fightin some guy at the
american arena in a little while how
about holdin down a nice ringside seat
there and then havin supper and a little
dancin afterwards i cant dance much
but im a bear at the supper table
oh said she youre the man thats
going to fight red roach

  is that his name  i asked yeah if
hes the man from the ruffian

  id like to go she said but i have
to go on in another dance number in
half an hour

  well i said the fight cant last
moren three or four rounds not with
me in there how bout me droppin
around the striped cat afterwards if
you aint through then ill wait for
you

  thats fine she said and noting my
slightly unsatisfied expression she said
if id known you were going to fight

so soon i wouldnt have let you eat that
ice cream

  oh that wont interfere with my
punchin ability any i said but i
would like a shot of hard licker to kind
of settle it on my stummick

  thats the truth sailors is supposed
to be hawgs about ice cream and i have
seen navy boys eat it in ligusting quan-
tities but its poor stuff for my belly
mike had ate the bowl full i give him
but hed a sight rather had a pan of
slush

  lets dont go in any of these
saloons said gloria these waterfront
bars sell you the same stuff rattlesnakes
have in their teeth i tell you ive got
a bottle of rare old wine not very far
from here i never touch it myself but
i keep it for my special friends and they
say its great youve time for a nip
havent you

  lead on sister i said ive always
got time to take a drink or oblige a
beautiful girl

  ah you flatterer she said giving
me a little push i bet you tell that to
every girl you meet

well to my surprise we halted
before a kind of ramshackle gym-
nasium and gloria took out a key and
unlocked the door

  i didnt tell you i had a kid brother
with me she said in answer to my sur-
prised glance hes a weakly sort of
kid and i have to support him as well
as myself poor kid he would come
with me when i left home well mr
salana who owns the gym lets him use
the equipment to build himself up its
healthy for him this is the boys key
i keep the wine hidden in one of the
lockers

  aint this where tony andrada
trains i asked suspiciously cause
if it is it aint no place for a nice girl
they is fighters and fighters my child
and tony is no credit to no business
hes always been a perfect gentle-
man towards me she answered of
course i come here only occasionally


fight stories

when my brother is working out- she
opened the door and we went in and
then she shut it to my slight surprise
i heard the click as she locked it she
switched on a light and i seen her bend-
ing over something then she swung
around and-wow-i got the most un-
expected dumfounding surprise of my
life to date when she turned she had
a heavy indian club in both hands and
she heaved it up and crashed it down
on my head with everything she had be-
hind it

  well i was so utterly dumfounded i
just stood and gaped at her and mike
he nearly had a fit id always taught
him never to bite a woman and he just
didnt know what to do gloria was
staring at me with eyes that looked like
they was going to jump right out of her
head she glanced down at the broken
fragments of the indian club in a kind
of stunned way and then the color all
ebbed out of her face leaving her white
as a ghost

  thats a nice way to do a friend i
said reproachfully i dont mind a joke
but youve made me bite my tongue

  she cringed back against the wall and
held out both hands pitifully dont
hit me she cried please dont hit me
i had to do it

  well if  ever seen a scared girl it
was then she was shaking in every
limb

  you dont need to insult me on top
of busting a club on my skull i said
with my quiet dignity i never hit no
woman in my life and i aint figurin on
it

  all to once she began to cry oh
said she im ashamed of myself but
please listen - ive lied to you my
brother is a fighter too and he just
about had this fight with red roach
when the promoter at the american
changed his mind and signed you up
instead this fight would have given
us enough to get back to new jersey
where those cows are grazing by the
babbling meadows i-i-thought when
you told me you were the one thats go-

ing to fight roach id fix it so you
wouldnt show up and theyd have to
use billy-thats my brother-after all
i was going to knock you unconscious
and tie you up till after the fight oh

ate ill die if i have to live this life
much longer she said passionately
and then she starts to bawl

  well i cant see as it was my fault
but i felt like a horse thief anyhow

  -dont cry i said id help you all
i can but i got all my jack sunk on the
imbroglio to win by a k o

  she lifted her tear stained face oh
steve you can help me just stay here
with me dont show up at the arena

go home please steve please please

  she had her arms around my neck and
was fairly shaking me in her eagerness

heart for the weaker sex but gee whiz

kerchief

waterfront fists



get back to them green cows and bab-
blin farm houses now i got to go
and before she had time to say an-
other word i kicked the lock oft the
door being in too big a hurry to have
her unlock it and the next second me
and mike was sprinting for the arena

i found bill tearing his hair and
walking the dressing room floor
here you are at last are you you
blankety-blank mick dipthong he
yelled blood-thirstily where you been 
you want to make a nervous wreck outa
me you realize you been committin
the one unpardonable sin by keepin the
crowd waitin for fifteen minutes
theyre yellin bloody murder and the
crew which is all out front in ringside
seats has been throwin chairs at the
ruffians men which has been howlin
youd run out on us the promoter says
if you aint in that ring in five minutes
hell run in a substitute

  and ill run him into the bay said
i sitting down and shucking my shoes
i gotta get my wand back a little boy
we had svens girl down all wrong
shes a peach as well as bein a square-
shootin-

  shut up and get into them trunks
howled bill doing a war-dance on the
cap id just took off youll never learn
nothin listen to that crowd well be
lucky if they dont lynch all of us
well the maddened fans was making
a noise like a hock of hungry lions but
that didnt worry me none id just got
into my fighting togs when the door
opened and the manager of the arena
stuck a pale face in

  i got a man in place of costigan-
he began when he saw me and stopped

  gangway i snarled and as i
pushed by him i saw a fellow in trunks
coming out of another dressing room
to my amazement it was tony ati-
drada which even had his hands taped
his jaw fell when he seen me and
his manager abe gold give a howl
they was two other thugs with them-
salana and joe cromwell-id been in

honolulu enough to know them yeggs

  wrhat do you think youre doin
here i snarled facing tony

  they want me to fight roach when
you run out- he begun

  bill grabbed my arm as i was mak-
ing ready to slug him for cats sake
he snarled you can lick him after you
flatten roach if you want to come on
its mighty funny he should turn up
right at this timei growled i thought
billy flynn was to fight roach if i
didnt show up

  whos billy flynn asked bill as
he rushed me up the aisle between howl-
ing rows of infuriated fans

  my new girls kid brother i an-
swered as i dumb through the ropes if
theyve did anything to him ill-

  my meditations was drowned by the
thunders of the mob who give me cheers
because id got there and razzes be-
cause i hadnt got there sooner

  on one side of the ring the sea girls
crew lifted the roof with their wild
whoops and  the other side the ruf-
fians roughnecks greeted me with
coarse rude squawks and impolite re-
marks

  well i glanced over to the opposite
corner and saw red roach for the first
and i hope the last time he was tall
and raw-boned and the ugliest human
i ever seen he had freckles as big as
mess pans all over him his nose was
flat and his low slanting forehead was
topped by a shock of the most scan-
dalously red hair i ever looked at when
he rose from his stool i seen he was
knock-kneed and when we came to the
center of the ring to pretend to listen
to instructions i was disgusted to note
that he was also cross-eyed at first i
thought he was counting the crowd and
it was slightly disconcerting to finally
decide he was glaring at me

we went back to our corners the
gong sounded the scrap started
and i got another jolt

  roach come out right foot and right
hand forward he was left-handed i


fight stories

was so disgusted i come near lighting in
and giving him a good cussing red-
headed cross-eyed - and left-handed 
and he was the first good port-sider id
ever met in a ring

  i forgot to say our weights was 
for me and  for him in addition he
was six feet three or just three inches
tallern me and he musta had a reach
of anyways fifteen fathoms when we
was still so far apart i didnt think he
could reach me with a pole when-barn
his right licked out to my chin i give
a roar and plunged in meaning to make
it a quick fight i wanted to crush this
inhuman freak before the sight of him
got on my nerves and rattled me

  but  was all at sea a left-hander
does everything backwards he leads
with his right and crosses his left he
side-steps to the left instead of the right
ordinarily this guy done everything a
port-siders supposed to do and a lot
more stuff he thought up for hisself he
had a fast hard straight right and a
wicked left swing - oh boy how he
could hit with that left seemed like
every time i did anything  got that
right in the eye or the mouth or on the
nose and whilst i was thinking about
that bam come the left and nearly
ripped my head clean off

  the long lanky mutt-it looked like
if i ever landed solid id bust him in
two but i couldnt get past that long
straight right my swings were all short
and his straight right beat my left hook
every time when i tried trading jabs
with him his extra reach ruint that-
anyway im a natural hooker my
straight left is got force but it aint as
accurate as it should be

  at the end of the first round my right
ear was nearly mangled in the second
frame he half closed my eye with a siz-
zling right hook and opened a deep
gash on my forehead at the beginning
of the third he dropped me for no-count
with a left hook to the body that nearly
caved me in the ruffians crew was
getting crazier every second and the
sea girls gang was yelling bloody mur-

der but i wasnt worried im used to
more punishment than i was getting and
i wasnt weakening any

  but dawg-gone it it did make me mad
not to be able to hit roach to date i
hadnt landed a single solid punch he
was a clever boxer in his way and his
style woulda made dempsey look like
a one-armed paperhanger carryin a
bucket

  he managed to keep me at long range
and he belted me plenty but it wasnt
his speed nor his punch that kept me all
at sea it was his cruel and unusual ap-
pearance  dawg-gone-them eyes of his
nearly had me batty i couldnt keep
from looking at em i tried to watch his
waist-line or his feet but every time my
gaze wouldst wander back to his dis-
torted optics they had a kinda fatal at-
traction for me whilst i wouldst be
trying to figure out where they was look-
ing-wham would come that left wing-
ing in from a entirely unexpected direc-
tion-and this continued

well after arising from that
knock-down in the third frame i
was infuriated and after chasing him
all around the ring and getting only
another black eye for my pains i got
desperate with the round half a min-
ute to go i wowed the audience by clos-
ing both my eyes and tearing in swing-
ing wild and regardless

  he was pelting me plenty but i didnt
care that visage of his wasnt upsetting
all my calculations as long as i couldnt
see it and in a second i felt my left
crash against what i knew to be a hu-
man jaw instantly the crowd went into
hystericals and i opened my eyes and
looked for the corpse

  my eyes rested on a recumbent figure
but it was not red roach to my
annoyance i realized that one of my
blind swings had connected with the
referee at the same instant roachs
swinging left crashed against my jaw
and i hit the canvas but even as i went
down i swung a wild dying effort right
which sunk in just above reds waist-
waterfront fists



line the round ended with all three of
us on the canvas

  our respective handlers dragged us to
our corners and somebody throwed a
bucket of water on the referee who was
able to answer the gong with us bat-
tlers by holding on to the ropes

  well as i sat in my corner sniffing
the smelling salts and watching reds
handlers massaging his suffering belly i
thought deeply a very rare habit of
mine while fighting i do not believe in
too much thinking it gives a fighter the
headache still and all with my jaw
aching from reds left and my eyes get-
ting strained from watching his unholy
face i rubbed the nose mike stuck into
my glove and meditated a left-hander
is a right-hander backwards nine times
out of ten his straight right will beat
your left jab if you lead your right to a
right-hander hell beat you to the punch
with his left but you can lead your
right to a left-hander because his left
has as far to travel as your right

  so when we come out for the fourth
round instead of tearing in i went in
cautious-like for me ignoring the yells
of the ruffians crew that i was getting
scared of their man red feinted with
his right so clumsy even i knowed it was
a feint and instantly shot my right with
everything i had behind it it beat his
left swing and landed solid but high
he staggered and i dropped him to his
all fours with a whistling left hook un-
der the heart he was up at nine and
caught me with a wild left swing as i
rushed in it dizzied me but i kept
coming and every time he made a mo-
tion with his left i shot my right some-
times i landed first and sometimes he
did and sometimes we landed simulta-
neous but my smashes had the most
kick behind them like most port-siders
when theyre groggy hed clean forgot
he had a right hand and was staking
everything on his left swing

  i battered him back across the ring
and he rallied and smashed over a
sledge-hammer left hook that rocked me
to my heels and made the blood spatter

  but i bored right in with a sizzling left
hook under the heart he gasped his
iknees buckled then he steadied hisself
and shot over his left just as i crashed
in with a right bam something ex-
ploded in my head and then i heard the
referee counting to my chagrin i
found i was on the canvas but roach
was there too

  the still weaving and glassy-eyed
referee was holding onto the ropes with
one hand and counting over us both but
i managed to reel up at six me and
red had landed square to the button at
just the same second but my jaw was
just naturally tougher than his he
hadnt twitched at ten and they had
to cariy him to his dressing room to
bring him to

  well a few minutes work  me with
smelling salts ammonia sponges and the
like made me as good as new i couldnt
hardly wait for bill to dress my cuts
with collodion but the minute i got my
clothes  and collected my winnings
and bets from the bartender whod come
to the ring under escort from both ships
i ducked out the back way i even left
mike with bill because hes always
scrapping with some other dog on the
streets and i was in a big hurry

  i was on my way to see i f gloria had
followed my advice also something else
one hundred and fifty bucks i won
with what i had that made three hun-
dred i got a hundred and fifty for the
fracas altogether i had lour hundred
and fifty dollars all in greenbacks of
large denomination in my jacket pocket
and i was going to give gloria every
cent of it if shed take it so she could
go back to new jersey and the cows
this sure wasnt no place for a nice girl
to be in and ill admit i indulged in
some dreams as i hurried along-about
the time id retire from the sea and
maybe gcr into the dairy farming busi-
ness in new jersey

i was headed for the striped cat
but on my way i passed salanas
gym and i noticed that they was a light


fight stories

in one of the small rooms which served
as a kind of office as i passed the door

i	distinctly heard a voice i knowed was
glorias i stopped short and started to
knock on the door then something made
me steal up close and listen-though i
aint a eavesdropper by nature from
the voices five people was in the room-
gloria salana abe gold joe crom-
well and tony

  dont hand us no line sister gold
was saying in his nasty rasping voice
you said leave it to you yeah we did
and look what it got us you was goin
to keep costigan outa the way sos we
could run tony in at the last minute
you know the promoter at the american
was all set to match tony with roach
when costigans ship docked and the big
cheese changed his mind and matched
the mick instead because the fool
sailors wanted the scrap

  roach woulda been a spread for
tony because the wop eats these port-
siders up the town sports know that
and they woulda sunk heavy on tony
we was goin to bet our shirts on roach
and tony would flop along about the
third then we coulda all left this dump
and gone to australia

  well we left it up to you to get rid
of costigan and what does he do i
ask you he walks in as big as you
please just when tony was fixing to go
in for him i ask you 

  well dont rag me said gloria in
a voice which startled me it was that
hard i did my best i got hold of a
swede aboard the sea girl and primed
the big still proper i stirred him up and
sent him down to climb costigan think-
ing hed bung the mick up so he couldnt
come on tonight or that costigan would
at least break his hands on him

  but the harp flattened him without
even spraining a thumb and the first
thing  knew he was waiting for me
outside the cabaret i thought hed come
to smack me down for sicking the swede
on him but the big slob had just come
to tell me the square-head couldnt keep
his date can you feature that well he

  fell for me right off naturally and i
got him into the gym here intending to
lay him cold and lock him up till after
the fight but say that big mick must
have a skull made of reinforced battle-
ship steel i shattered a five-pound in-
dian club over his dome without even
making him bat his eyes

  well i hope i never have a half-
minute like that again when i failed
to even stagger him with that clout i
thought i was a gone goose i had
visions of him twisting my head off and
feeding it to that ugly cannibal he calls
his bulldog

  but you cant tell about those tough
looking sluggers like him he didnt
even offer to lay a hand  me and
when i got my second wind i spun him
a yarn about having a kid brother that
needed this fight to get back home he
fell for it so easy that i thought i could
coax him to run out on his own accord
but he balked there all hed do was to
advise me to bet on him and then all at
once he said it was time for him to be
at the stadium and he busted right out
through the door and took it on the lam
making some crack about coming back
after the fight

  a fine mess youve made sneered
salana youve gummed things up
proper we had everything set for a
killing-

  a high class brand of sports you
are she snapped im ashamed to be
seen with you you cheap grafters a
big killing you dont know what one
is anyway what do you want me to
do cry

  we want you to give back that hun-
dred we paid you in advance snarled
salana and if you dont youll cry
plenty

  and i guess you think i risk my
life for such cheap welchers as you
for nothing she sneered not one
cent-

  there was the sound of a blow and
gloria give a short sharp cry which was
cut short in a sort of gasp

  give her the works joe salana
waterfront fists



snarled you cant cross me you lit-
tle- 

never mind what he called her
id have half killed him for that
alone i tore the door clean off the hinges
as i went through it and i seen a sight
that made a red mist wave in front of
me so everything in that room looked
bloody and grim

  salana had gloria down on a chair
and was twisting both her arms up be-
hind her back till it looked like theyd
break joe cromwell had the fingers of
his left hand sunk deep in her white
throat and his right drawed back to
smash in her face tony and abe gold
was looking  with callous contemptu-
ous sneers

  they all turned to look as the door
crashed in and i saw salana go white
as i give one roar and went into action
he turned loose of the girl but before
he could get his hands up i crashed him
with a left-hander that crushed his nose
and knocked out four teeth and my next
smash tore joe cromwells ear loose and
left it hanging by a shred another of
the same sort stood him on his head in
a corner with a cracked jaw-bone and
almost simultaneous abe gold barely
missed me with a pair of brass knuckles
and tony landed hard  my ear but
i straightened with a right-hander that
dropped gold across salana with three
broken ribs and missed a left swing
that wouldst of decapitated tony hadst
it landed

   i aint one of these fellows which has
to be crazy mad to put up a good fight
but when i uni crazy mad theys no
limit to the destruction i can hand out
maybe in the ring under ordinary cir-
cumstances tony could of cut me to
ribbons but here he never had a chance
i didnt even feel the punches he was
raining on me and after missing a flock
of swings in a row i landed under his
jaw with a hay-making right-hander
that i brought up from the floor tony
turned a complete somersault in the air
and when he come down his head hit

the wall with a force that laid his scalp
open and wouldst of knocked him cold
if he hadnt already been unconscious
before he landed

  maybe a minute and a half after i
busted through the door i stood alone
in the middle of the carnage panting
and glaring down at the four silent fig-
ures which littered the room all i
craved was for all the other yeggs in
honolulu to come busting in pretty
soon i looked around for gloria and
saw her cringing in a corner like she was
trying to flatten herselt out against the
wall she was white-faced and her eyes
was blazing with terror

  she give a kind of hunted cry
when i looked at her dont please
dont

  please dont what i snapped in
some irritated aint you learned by
this time that i dont clout frails i
come in here to rescue you from these
gypes and you insult me

  forgive me she begged i cant
help but be a little afraid of you-you
look so much like a gorilla-

  what

  i mean youre such a terrible
fighter she hastily amended come 
-lets get out of here before these
welchers come to

  would that they wouldst  brooded
what i done to em was just a sample
of what im goin to do to em dawg-
gone it some of these days somebodys
goin to upset my temper then ill lose
control of myself and hurt somebody
well we went out  the street
which was mostly deserted and rather
dimly lighted and gloria said pretty
soon thank you for rescuing me if
my brother had been there-

  gloria i said wearily aint you
ever goin to stop lyin i was outside
the door and heard it all

  oh  said she

  well i said i reckon im a fool
when it comes to women i thought i
was stuck on you and didnt have sense
enough to know you was stringin me
why i even brung the four hundred


fight stories

and fifty bucks i won intendin to give
it to yon

  and so saying i threw out the wad
of bills waved it reproachfully in
front of her eyes and replaced it in my
jacket pocket all to once she started
crying

  oh steve you make me ashamed of
myself youre so fine and noble-
well i said with my quiet dignity
i know it but i cant help it its just
my nature

  im so ashamed she sobbed
theres no use lying salana paid me
a hundred dollars to get you out of the
way but steve im changing my ways
right here im not asking you to for-
give me because i guess its too much
to ask and youve done enough for me
but im going home tomorrow that
stuff i told you about the dairy farm in
new jersey was the only thing i told
you that wasnt a lie im going home
and live straight and i want to kiss you

just once-because youve showed me the
error of my ways

  and so saying she threw her arms
around me and kissed me vigorously-
and me not objectin in no manner

  im going back to the old pure sim-
ple life she said back to the green
meadows and babbling cows

  and she made off down the street at
a surprising rate of speed i watched
her go and a warm glow spread over
me after all i thought i do know wo-
men and the hardest of them is softened
by the influence of a strong honest
manly heart like mine

  she vanished around a corner and i
turned back toward the hibernian bar
at the same time reaching for my bank
roll then i give a yell that woke up
everybody in that section of honolulu
with cold sweat standing out on them
now i knowed why she wanted to put
her arms around me my money was
gone she loved me-she loved me not

mcgoverns long count

the never-ending controversy over the alleged long count in the second
tunney-dempsey fight brings to mind a famous long-count fight that
took place when gene and jack were still in the nursing-bottle and peram-
bulator stage the battle in question was between terry mcgovern then
featherweight champion of the world and oscar gardner a prominent chal-
lenger for honors in that class

   gardner was famous for his right-hand punch he had cut a swath
through the featherweights of the day with it and was regarded as the
runner-up in terrible terrys division early in the fight he crossed his
terrible right to mcgoverns jaw down went the champion in those days
when a man was knocked down his antagonist did not have to go back to
his corner of the ring so gardner stood over terry waiting for him to get
up terry was numbed and bewildered throwing out groping hands he
got hold of gardners leg

   more by instinct than anything else he began to pull himself to his feet
gardner tried to get his legs away but terry hung on the referee johnny
white has been accused of partiality to the champion just as the referee in
the chicago fight was accused of favoring tunney with a long count at any
rate white did not do very much about making terrible terry release gard-
ners legs and after scrambling around with his opponent the champion
eventually got to his feet

   no official time was taken but spectators at the ringside have claimed
that it took mcgovern nearly half a minute even with the assistance of his
antagonists legs to get to his feet however when he did get up he came
back strong and shortly thereafter knocked gardner cold the fight caused
a great scandal in fistic circles and is still discussed wherever old-timers get
together
the baby-face terror

by jack kofoed

author of fitzsimmons the wonder fighter

a beautiful scrapper to watch-that mclarnin boy and a cool yet dynamite-
laden battler to boot its in the irish blood of him not without reason is
he known as the baby-face terror

jimmy mclarnin a thin pale
little fellow was picked up and
taught how to box by a canadian
war veteran pop foster because pop
liked the looks of jimmys legs baby
face as they called the tiny fighter won
steadily he beat fidel labarba and
jackie fields and joey sangor the
only one who had anything on him was
bud taylor but jimmy grew from
one class into another until he was a
full-fledged lightweight and was bitten
by a desire to show his wares in new
york by knocking ottt lou kid kap-
lan and beating billy wallace jimmy
won the attention he wanted tex rick-
ard signed him to fight sid terris and
baby face made his debut on the new
york scene

now go on with the story in detail

new york glittering broad-
way jimmy mclarnin was daz-
zled and happy when he first set foot
in gotham-town he went around to
forty-ninth street and eighth avenue
to marvel at the size of madison square
garden and blush a little at the signs
advertising the coming fight between sid
terris and jimmy mclarnin there
were men at the box-office already it
was  small job to crash new york-
to make people pay out hard-earned
money to see you fight they said new
york was cold and hard to failures but
that if you caught its love and admira-
tion nothing was too good for you
well the first obstacle in the way to
gaining that success was a young gentle-
man named terris he must be re-
moved

  when jimmy weighed in at the com-




fight stories

missions office he had his first look at
sid terris he saw an extraordinarily
thin young man whose skin was drawn
tightly over his cheek-bones and mottled
with a hectic flush his legs and arms
looked powerful sid was a pretty good
hitter but he had won fame because of
his extraordinary speed of foot they
called him the east side will o the
wisp and lightweights had found him
as easy to collar as a mosquito

  jimmy studied his opponent terris
didnt have much resistance to punish-
ment you could see that the thing
to do with him was to get close crowd
him keep belting away no fancy work
no dancing around or boxing just
get in there and hit if you whaled
him a couple of times hed go not
through lack of gameness but just be-
cause nature hadnt built him to stand
a walloping

  terris was a new york idol he
packed em in when he fought and
jimmy was making his big-time debut
against this fellow knock him out
and youre made boy fight fans like
everyone else string with the winners
put sid terris away and youll pull
them in at the gate like nobodys busi-
ness

  hes awful fast said pop foster
dont let him get away from you
jimmy hes like one of them lightning-
bugs if you nail him hell go get
close before you begin shootin

 dont worry pop said baby
face i think i know how to beat this
guy

  the hours whirled by almost be-
fore he knew it jimmy mclarnin sat
in the glaring white ring a quizzical
little smile on his lips as he looked across
the ring at sid terris well new york
here i am are you going to like me
will you take to the way i belt em
over i want you to like me new
york its too bad that you cant get
anywhere without putting somebody
else out of the picture theres terris
a nice mild boy if i plaster him
away his money earning days will sim-

mer out but thats none of my busi-
ness its his job to put me away if
he can

  gee how the galleries are roaring for
terris they certainly like him in this
town whats that joe humphries is
saying   the representative light-
weight of the pacific coast jimmy mc-
larnin thats the tip to get up and
smile and bow gosh that was a nice
hand for a stranger new yorkers are
not such cold people after all looks
like they want to give everyone a break

  now out in the center of the ring to
listen to cut-and-dried instructions
look at terris hes pale but then
they say he is always pale these east
side boys never had much sun to color
them up but you can see his heart
thumping against his ribs bang bang
bang hes nervous all right is that
any sign lots of great fighters have
been nervous before the gong-jeffries
ketchel rafts of them that doesnt
mean that they are ready to be pushed
over jimmy himself never felt par-
ticularly fidgety but everybody is dif-
ferent

  a pat on the back from pop a quick
handclasp the boys are in their corners
waiting for the bell there it is out
goes jimmy mclarnin for his first fight
in new york

terris skipped about on those
springy long legs of his like a
grasshopper prodding with his left
hand gosh he was fast wasnt he
looked as though he could jump clean
across the ring with one bound no
wonder they couldnt catch him very
easily jim went in with a rush hooked
and missed sid jabbed him and sprang
warily away the crowd yelled its ad-
miration go ahead and yell this thing
hasnt even started yet

  mclarnin wasnt going to waste his
energy firing at long range he went in
flat-footed seeking to get close enough
so the target would be easier to hit
theres terris against the ropes jimmy
lashed out with his left again but the
the baby-face terror



punch was glancing and did no damage
sid was in the middle of the ring
laughing at him no there was all
the seriousness of an undertaker in the
pale gaunt face of the east sidcr but
a hint of derision in his eyes

  jimmy came closer terris his left
hand extended hesitated like a gazelle
ready to fly a feint to the body the
will o the wisp pulled down his guard
and whango-over went the right with
every ounce of power jimmy could put
into it the blow landed squarely on the
jaw terris went down as though he
had been hit by a blackjack he went
flat on his back his head cracking
against the floorboards

  jimmy said to himself that finishes
him tougher guys than he would go
out with that wallop look at him
eyes shut gloves open they could
count a hundred over him and he
wouldnt move well boy this is a
pretty nice start for me

  the place was in a bedlam the
referee counted seriously as though
there was a chance that terris would
get up but the will o the wisp lay
there helpless done for

  nine ten-out

  jimmy mclarnin turned a hand-
spring in the center of the ring and
rushed over to where pop foster stood
with a beatific smile on his broad
grizzled face their metropolitan debut
had been a riot

  it was nothing less than that really
their share for the quick knockout over
terris amounted to  by far
the largest purse the partnership had
ever taken in but there was even more
to it than that jimmy signed for a
four-day appearence at foxs academy
of music for  and was swamped
with offers to appear in half a dozen
cities

  pop turned down all bids of a fistic
nature and waited to see what madison
square garden would do next that
was the big bet jimmy had proved
himself a fighter a hitter and a drawing
card they would be anxious to put
fight-flcpt-

him on again quickly sure enough
rickard called them in he wanted
jimmy to fight phil mcgraw

  that sounded swell phil was a
greek lightweight a battling nelson
sort of punch-absorber a club fighter of
the first order but neither a fine boxer
nor a great hitter it looked like a softer
spot to pop than sid terris had been
but a good box-office attraction at that
there wasnt even any need of talking
it over with jimmy baby face was
perfectly willing to take anyone or
everyone the more the better each
fight was another step toward the cham-
pionship

  mcgraw was noted for his rugged-
ness no lightweight in the game had
shown greater ability to absorb a thump-
ing without slowing up he had fought
most of the men in his division and
none had hurt him those who believed
that jimmys quick victory over sid
terris had been something of an acci-
dent saw in this match a real test of the
boys hitting power

  phil himself was confident that
mclarnin couldnt hurt him he believed
he could take anything shot his way and
outrough and outpunch baby face as
soon as these hitters understood that
they couldnt hurt you they lost most
of their stuff the old confidence went

  they drew an excellent crowd to
madison square garden jimmy had
caught on instantly and mcg raws des-
perate battles with stanislaus loayza
and others had made him a drawing
card too

  there was a big difference between
mcgraw and sid terris the latter
had flashy speed and some boxing
ability but was entirely lacking in ability
to take a punch phil on the other
hand was not extraordinarily fast but
could stand up under a walloping until
the cows came home

  there was one interesting occurrence
on the bill though it had no connection
with jimmy mclarnin a boy named
a singer made his garden debut in the
opening four-rounder and knocked out


fight stories

tommy gervcl within a very short
time singer was to share with mclarnin
the distinction of being the best draw-
ing card in new york fjn then he
was tremendously popular with the east
side fans and a string of victories
spread his popularity throughout the
city jimmy had never heard of him at
that time

 when the main event started
mcgraw rushed at baby face phil
was wide open for any kind of a punch
but not being a boxer he depended on
the ferocity of his attack to make up
for his defensive shortcomings that
ferocity wasnt enough to bother jimmy
mclarnin he was a sharpshooter and
in this instant was firing at the side of
a barn he just couldnt miss

jimmys first right-hand drive
landed flush to the button if
mcgraw had not known before what
it was to lie hurt he knew then a
bomb exploded inside his head his feet
were swept out from under him he
had been back toward the ropes and he
pitched head-first through them onto
the heads of the men in the press seats
phil didnt know where he was didnt
know anything except that he had been
hurled out of the ring and that if he
didnt get back quickly hed be counted
out

  so he scrambled around reached for
the the bottom strand of the ropes and
hauled himself up the referee had
only counted to five so quick had been
mcgraws actions but phil didnt know
what the count was and couldnt take
any chances he hitched himself to his
feet shook his head blinked his eyes and
catching sight of jimmy mclarnin
rushed at him again

  it was really too bad to take the
money baby face didnt even bother
to feint he just whipped the right to
the jaw again and down went phil
mcgraw the latter felt as though he
had been hit with a mallet but he had
his reputation to live up to he was
an iron man who ever heard of an

iron man being knocked out in the first
round who even heard of him stay-
ing on the floor to take advantage of a
count mcgraw scrambled to his feet
as quickly as he could and that was
quick enough since the referee had only
reached two

  this time he had a little more difficulty
in locating mclarnin his head
was going around like a top his jaw
felt as though it had swollen into a
balloon no wonder sid terris had
been flattened so quickly no wonder
this baby had knocked out kid kaplan
and all those others could he hit
whooie it was nothing short of mur-
der well lets go where is he
mcgraws bleared eyes focused them-
selves on the form of jimmy mclar-
nin suddenly looming before him

  he put his gloves up before his face
peering over the tops of them no use
being too reckless when a guy is throw-
ing dynamite bombs in your face let
mclarnin lead hed wait a bit

 then-and mcgraw hadnt the
faintest notion of how it happened- an-
other bomb exploded under his chin

  he felt the resin scraping under his
elbows the sound of the explosion
rang in his ears phil shook his head
trying to clear it his legs felt all right
there was no weakness there yet but
his dome felt as though it weighed a
thousand pounds it took all his deter-
mination to pyll it up to lift that huge
weight upright

  phil had no idea of what round it
was or how long it would be before
the round ended he didnt know how
often he had been on the floor either
the only thing he was conscious of was
the absolute necessity of getting up
again he didnt know why he should
get up-but he just had to

  all over the garden people were yell-
ing for the referee to stop it there
was no logic in having a game man
slaughtered when he didnt have
a chance

  jimmy looked at the referee the lat-
ter shook his head he wasnt going
the baby-face terror



to stop it yet mcgraw had lived
through terrible punishment before this
stop it now and his people would yell
bloody murder the rest of their lives
lets see what happens

  mclarnin walked in set himself and
shot another right-hander to the jaw
down down down went mccarthy to
the bottom of the sea only this time
his name was mcgraw down through
an alley of velvet blackness phil
mcgraw felt as though he had been
dropped off a precipice into a bottom-
less abyss but he wound up with a
thump on his hands and knees again

  how many times had he been there
he didnt know he didnt care either
he didnt care about anything wearily
he scuffled his way to his feet again as
the referee reached eight he was
rubber-legged with punishment his
knees buckled under him just the
weight of his body on them was too
much to carry his arms hung by his
side his eyes were glazed unseeing
another blow might be fatal there
would be no resistance to it the greek
was utterly relaxed ready to fall with-
out being struck

  then the referee stepped between the
men there was no doubt in his mind
or anyone elses about it now mcgraw
couldnt last out the round let alone the
fight why permit it to continue he
didnt

chapter vii
for the title

having knocked out the fleet-
footed terris and the rugged
mcgraw jimmy waited for other game
it was presented to him shortly in the
person of the chilian indian stanislaus
loayza loayza was beetle-browed
and tough as shoe-leather he was
tougher than mcgraw for he had twice
beaten the greek in savage hair-raising
battles if any of the lightweights
could stop jimmys knockout streak

this dark skinned man from south
america should be the man to do it

  stanislaus who had little imagina-
tion and no fear of anyone went at
mclarnin the way a hungry dog would
snap at a bone he slapped away with
both fists without accomplishing much
for mclarnin had forgotten more about
boxing than the indian would ever
know-and then the right hand went
over

  from that moment on it was just too
bad mclarnin slaughtered loayza
he hit him with everything but the
water bucket he raked him from brow
to belt line with the choicest punches in
his repertoire and still loayza came
striding in for more if you couldnt
admire his judgment you could applaud
his gameness and ability to stand up un-
der the most ferocious punishment he
didnt go over as easily as terris and
mcgraw at each savage thump he
shook his head knit his brows and
charged in for more as for handing
out any punishment himself-lie
couldnt have hit jimmy with a hand-
ful of buckshot

  it wasnt a fight but a case of ag-
gravated assault-and-battery no one
rightly understood how stanislaus man-
aged to keep his feet but constantly
dripping water wears away stones and
the pounding of mclarnins fists had
the same effect on the indian the
fight ended in the fourth round-and
everyone was glad when it did

  this third straight sensational victory
of his new york invasion put jimmy
in an enviable position he was set now
for a shot at sammy mandell the title-
holder and when he went into the ring
against the handsome sheik of rock-
ford hed carry a lot of new york
money the big town was just crazy
about him he looked like the greatest
lightweight to come down the road since
the days of benny leonard

  tex rickard was very keen for a
lightweight championship bout between
mandell and mclarnin that class was
very close to his heart for he had started


fight stories

his promotional career with battling
nelson and joe gans in the humid heat
of goldfieid nevada he wanted an-
other lightweight title bout-one that
might equal the success of the battles
staged between benny leonard and lew
tendler mclarnin had become star-
tlingly popular in new york

  it looked like a great financial shot
but old pop was a little dubious he
knew fights and fighters and he knew
as well as anyone else that mandell was
a capable polished ringman-not a
leonard perhaps-but a master just
the same he wasnt sure that he
wouldnt be rushing jimmy too fast by
making the match

  baby face himself was the deciding
factor pass up this chance to stiffen
mandell  i should say not sure
well fight him and beat him too
wasnt that what they had come to new
york for werent those victories over
terris and mcgraw and loayza the
steps toward the match pop finally
acquiesced and jimmy began to train

  the work of getting down to weight
was more difficult than he had antici-
pated it was the old story over again
he was growing and nature would
have to be placated that was the worst
part of this racket the business of mak-
ing weight

  jimmy entered the ring wearing a re-
splendent green bathrobe with the fa-
mous yellow harp embroidered on the
back his round pink face was sober
this was a chance that could not be
taken lightly you didnt laugh off a
championship of course he wasnt
afraid he believed that he could whip
any man of his weight in the world
but-the championship of the world was
at stake

 a moment later sammy mandell
climbed through the ropes he was
shrouded in a brown bathrobe and his
dark good-looking face was just as
serious as jimmys he realized that
he was putting his most prized posses-
sion on the line against the most danger-
ous contender in the world

as joe humphries introduced can-
nonball martin and joe glick
both local favorites pop foster and dia
dollings hovered over their charge like
parents over a new-born child the
crowd was impatient they wanted the
fight to start joes introduction of the
champion brought an enthusiastic cheer
but nothing compared with the whole-
hearted roar of applause that burst forth
when mclarnin rose to take his bow

  the irish boy had caught the metro-
politan imagination the first time he
showed his wares in new york his
subsequent showings had cemented that
affection everyone wanted him to win

  referee magnolia called the rivals to
the center of the ring for instructions
they were solemn as schoolboys caught
in a prank that might mean expulsion
jimmys heart hammered against his
ribs lets get going action was an
antidote for nervousness once he was
throwing leather this crowded sensa-
tion in his chest would pass what was
the use of being nervous it didnt
help and it might make it seem that he
was afraid-when he wasnt really
when the crowd and the importance of
this fight and his own hot desire to win
were the causes of his jumpiness

  mclarnin looked at mandell for the
first time when they faced each other
in the center of the ring down inside
of him he was saying im going to
lick you within an hour ill be the
lightweight champion of the world
lightweight champion of the world
ili lick you

  they smiled a little diffidently at
each other when referee magnolia
slapped their backs and said thats all
boys

  they shuffled to their corners and
stood waiting for that last interminable
moment to pass irish and italian
good-looking clean honest two finer
boys never faced each other in any ring

  the brass voice of the gong called
them into action

  jimmy rushed fists flying he might
have boxed-and had he boxed as he
the baby-face terror



had in earlier bouts might have equalled
sammy in cleverness but blah with
that he was a fighter-a slugger hed
knock mandell into the middle of next
week championships shouldnt pass
on decisions the way to win was by a
knockout flatten em

  the sheik of rockford wasnt there
to be flattened so early in the fuss he
was a flickering beam of light he
flashed around the ring on his talented
toes but used more than footwork his
jab was perfection straight as a piston
and with the power of his shoulders be-
hind it it wasnt a powder puff that
struck jimmy mclarnin but a balled
up missile of bone and leather it stung
hurt disconcerted jimmy he had never
run into anything as bothersome as that
left hand it was continually in his
face

  still no one as game and confident as
jimmy mclarnin loses confidence
through being disconcerted sure he
might be cut up made to look bad for a
while but what of that he had the
utmost faith in his right hand it had
knocked out some great lightweights it
would knock out sammy mandell if it
landed and mclarnin didnt believe that
the man lived who could keep him from
landing for fifteen rounds

  what were a few bruises sure the
champion found it easy to poke him
with that jab why not he was com-
ing in wide open bothering about noth-
ing but landing the one big vital shot
that was all he needed hed gamble
on the rest sammy wasnt a hard
hitter though a punishing one jimmy
could afford to gamble on a ten-to-one
basis hed trade one right cross for
ten jaibs it didnt make any difference
if he looked good or bad to the specta-
tors at this stage of the game hed
have them cheering for him before the
finish-and what a finish it would be

mandell seemed so darned confi-
dent so sure of himself without
being careless he didnt jab as most
fighters do flicking the left hand into

the other fellows face he put some
steam into it his shoulders were back
of the blows and jimmys head bobbed
back under them in the clinches-and
there were many of them in the first
few rounds-sammy showed his greater
experience by tying jimmy up

  the belfast boy fumed he wanted
so desperately to land he tried so
hard as he rushed and swung and
missed mandell ripped him with both
hands at times the champion smiled
broadly and winked at his manager
eddie kane as though to say imagine
this guy thinkin he can lick me

  this fight as a matter of simple
truth must be reported as a picture of
a master working with a pupil jimmy
game and willing as he was simply
couldnt find the target and his own
pink cheeks felt the continual impact of
his rivals gloves

  in the fifth mclarnins wild swings
occasionally found the mark there
was plenty of steam and danger in
them but they didnt land often enough
to balance the rain of punches that fell
upon him

  by the time the seventh had passed
the little irishmans face was dyed
crimson the blood provoked mandell
to further efforts experts had scoffed
at his hitting powers compared with
mclarnins he hit away at a faster
pace

  through it all jimmy came rushing
in his blue eyes narrowed against the
storm he was not discouraged the
picture of sid terris and lou kaplan
and others writhing on the floor spurred
him on terris was faster than man-
dell kaplan was tougher yet both
had dropped under the mclarnin blows
mandell would too sooner or later
but the champions stabbing jab kept
him off balance the hooks and
counters and crosses shook him though
none seemed to hurt him vitally

  there was a certain sameness to the
bout a lack of thrill and drama it was
not because either boy slackened his
efforts for a moment it was ratheij


fight stories

because there was no rise and fall to
the flow of action one round was too
similar to the other jimmy rushed
swinging and mandell made him miss
and hit him in return

  by the end of the eleventh mc-
larnins left eye had closed under the
barrage of blows it gave his ibaby face
the appearance of being peculiarly
askew like that of a bacchus cherub
it did more than make him look queer
half-blinded the game little irishman
was more than ever a wide open target
for his clever rival

  still never for a single instant did
jimmy stop trying though the pound-
ing he had undergone had robbed him
of the sting of his punch he kept throw-
ing it desperately he knew as well as
anyone that his only chance lay in a
knockout-and the chance had faded
away almost into nothingness

  and he kept trying right through to
the very last second when the final
bell sounded it found him lunging in
feebler physically but just as ibrave and
determined as ever

  when the bell rang jimmys pink-
oheeked face was only a caricature of
its smooth and childish self the pink
had deepened to a dull red over his
shut eye was a bloated and discolored
lump his slim waistline wras banded
with the crimson imprint of a thou-
sand blows the champion had landed

  mclarnin walked over and shook
hands with his conqueror he smiled
with no hint of regret or envy

  you fought a great fight champ
he said gracefully admitting the de-
cision before it had been announced
it just wasnt my night some other
time eh

  thanks answered mandell youre
the gamest boy i ever saw jimmy you
deserve another chance sure ill give
it to you whenever it can be arranged
the belfast boy went back to his
comer to soothe pop foster who was
more cut up about the defeat than
jimmy of course mclarnin was
barbed by disappointment but being a

confirmed optimist was certain that his
time would come this didnt mean
that he would never climb to the title
bosh hed get there it was just
his misfortune that on this night
sammy mandell had been at his superb
best and that jimmy mclarnin hadnt
thats all there was to it if they met
again he felt-in spite of the trounc-
ing hed just taken-that he would win
and that the lightweight champion of
the world would finish with his nose in
the resin

      chapter viii
      the blare of battle

discouraged but not disheart-
ened at the lacing mandell had
given him jimmy started again on the
trail that leads to championships

  he was again finding more and more
difficulty in making weight in a few
years he had grown from a flyweight to
a lightweight and the end was not yet
he would finish up as a welter sure as
shooting mclarnin hoped that this
transformation would take some time
yet he wanted another shot at man-
dell his irish optimism flamed high
nobody was going to hold a perma-
nent edge on him

   as a starter he took on ray miller
through the medium of one of the best
left ihooks in the business ray had
climbed out of a shoe salesmans job and
became a contender for the lightweight
championship smart ring generalship
and hitting ability had made him ex-
tremely popular

  it was one of the worst matches pop
foster ever made-though it was more
a matter of bad luck than anything else
jimmy had an old cut over one eye
miller made that a target from the
start and soon ripped it wide open the
blood gushed out in a stream nothing
his hard working seconds could do
stopped that crimson river it annoyed
jimmy no end he could hardly see
the baby-face terror



and his work became less and less ef-
fective he weakened physically of
course and though he was in no real
danger of being stopped the referee
ended the fight in the eighth round-
awarding a technical knockout to
miller

  this was one of the greatest upsets
of the year no one could figure ray
miller-good as he was-stopping
jimmy mclarnin those who de-
pended on brief newspaper accounts for
the lesult of the fight wondered if
jimmy was through if his hard work
as a youngster had burned him out

  it hadnt of course but baby face
lost prestige throughout the country
stopped by ray miller imagine that
play that one on your victrola boys
and use it as a lesson not to bet on
fights the unexpected happens so fre-
quently in the ring game that it almost
comes to be the expected

  jimmy became a question as well as a
popular idol in new york the fans
had seen him badly trounced by man-
dell and now he had ibeen stopped by
miller just how far back had he
slipped would his nice smile and great
punch disappear from the ring most
of us doubted that baby face was too
young he had not suffered sufficient
punishment to batter him down the
garden matched him with joe glick so
that we might all find out

  then the ring game suffered its great-
est loss tex rickard died of acute
appendicitis at miami beach his body
was sent north and he lay in state in
the madison square garden his execu-
tive genius had created jimmy mclarn-
in was one of those who mourned rick-
ard had represented great things to him
rickard had given him his first oppor-
tunity in new york and now the cold
silent man from the north was gone
from the scene of his greatest triumphs
it was a sharp lesson to the belfast
boy he saw how trivial are all things
in the face of death

  but even such a happening as rick-
ards death could not halt the march of

business mclarnin trained hard for
the fight with glick this represented
the turning point of his career a de-
feat now would set him hack a long way
it would be nothing short of ruinous
he must win and win decisively to
hold his place in new yorks affections
there were no two ways about it he
had to win

  jimmy went to the garden that night
a very serious young man

more than nineteen thousand peo-
ple stood bareheaded banked
from floor to topmost gallery of madi-
son square garden

 in the darkened ring-where two
days before the flower decked coffin of
tex rickard had rested-stood jack
dempsey a very solemn and unhappy
dempsey and joe humphries

  joe of the silver throat had spoken
simply of the departed barnum of the
ring he spoke simply because he felt
deeply just as dempsey did

  through the stillness came the haunt-
ing note of taps and the deep voice
of the veteran announcer    and may
his soul rest in peace amen

  and the nineteen thousand who had
come to cheer jimmy mclarnin and
joe glick stayed to mourn the man who
had given them madison square gar-
den

  glick had never been a champion but
for years he had been an annoyer of
champions pie was a smart defensive
boxer and a fair hitter he knew his
business and a good part of that busi-
ness was to see that he wasnt hurt a
tough fellow to lick this button-liole
maker from williamsburg an exceed-
ingly tough one

  he started to make it difficult for
jimmy in the very first round baby
face wanted to end the matter quickly
he threw rights until glick set him
back on his heels with well-timed jabs
then mclarnin decided that this af-
fair was not to he ended so quickly he
began whipping his left hook to the
mark those digs made joe take to


fight stories

cover but he always came out with a
flurry of punches that landed

  student that he was james mclarnin
found out exactly what joe glick had in
those three minutes of fighting it
wasnt enough he decided to cause him
any trouble bingo with the left hook
that would win this fight for him hed
left hook this baby to death

  jimmy did exactly that in the second
round and wound it up with a blasting
right-hander at the hell that almost
hurled the button-hole maker through
the ropes it was exactly that sort of a
story through to the seventh round mc-
larnin winning all of them he not
only outhit joe but outboxed him as
well glick wrapped himself in a beau-
tiful defense and was never in real
danger of being knocked out oc-
casionally he would land a rousing left
or right himself but these spurts were
too rare to give him an advantage

  the seventh was a fine slugging bee
clicks seconds urged him to get out
and fight-to take chances if need be
he couldnt wrin by staying in his shell
get out there and trade with im

  joe had apparently arrived at that
decision himself he started by pepper-
ing jimmys nose with a fast left jab
that brought a spurt of blood that
stirred the irishmans pride and temper
back he tore in a furious effort to
knock glick out he pegged away with
both fists and the button-hole maker
stood up to him in fine style and fired
back at him

  it was a rip-snorting fight those
who thought that glick excelled only in
defending himself were surprised to see
that he took what mclarnin sent over
and dealt out punches himself that
werent labelled creampuffs

  the eighth and the ninth were hot
too though jimmy increased his advan-
tage by dint of continual leading the
final was the tip-off on the whole fight
they slugged furiously in mid-ring
neither giving ground until that canto
was nearly over then bit by bit joe
retreated fighting bravely ibut unable

to do any execution in the face of mc-
larnins tireless attack jimmys arms
moved like pistons he threw eighty
percent of the blows and did eighty
percent of the execution

  there was absolutely no question as
to the justice of the decision which went
unanimously to mclarnin

  incidentally it might be mentioned
that with popular prices prevailing-that
is with a top charge of five dollars for
a ring-side seat-the mclarnin-glick
bout drew  a record for that
scale jimmy of course was the mag-
net he always pulled em at the box
office and against a popular metropoli-
tan regular like glick was sure fire

  outside of perhaps jack dempsey
there wasnt a better liked boy in the
ring than jimmy mclarnin the
crowds he always drew was proo
enough of that

  there hadnt been any doubt in the
minds of those who saw the bout be-
tween jimmy and joe that baby face
was the better man still doubt is not
essential in the making of matches
the boys had waged a great fight-one
that was well worth going to see the
chances were all in favor of them do-
ing exactly that thing again besides-
most important of all they had attracted
an enormous gate so match-maker
tom mcardle proposed staging an en-
core

  it was all right with jimmy he was
readying up for a second shot at ray
miller another meeting with glick
would be an excellent warm-up sure
he would meet the button-hole maker
again why not joe was quite as
willing i doubt that he really believed
he could whip mclarnin but he had
been very well paid for the last match
and had suffered no particular damage
even if he had lost

  they met again in madison square
garden and again a goodly crowd was
there jimmy went in very de-
terminedly he should have knocked
glick out the first time they met he
would do it now
the baby-face terror



making up your mind to do some-
thing and then doing it are quite
different things however jimmy ac-
complished what he set out to do and
he did it in jig-time

  the first round indicated that their
battle might be a repetition of the first
one it wasnt anything like it in
the second mclarnin hit the button-hole
maker with his right hand-hit him with
everything he had and exactly on the
proper spot after that there was
nothing much to do but sweep up mr
glick and carry him thence

  that quick and flashing victory
cemented the return bout between mc-
larnin and ray miller in madison
square garden it intensified interest
in it new york having seen both
men in action could not believe that
their jimmy could have been the victim
of millers left hook great a weapon
as that hook was now that he had
finished off glick in jig-time they
wanted fo see him try to reverse the
verdict that the chicagoan held over
him

  the principal drawback was the ques-
tion of weight jimmy had grown into
a welterweight there was no doubting
that he could do nothing but hurt
himself if he tried to make  pounds
at two oclock in the afternoon miller
on the other hand was something less
than a legitimate lightweight he could
do  pounds very easily and  was
heavy for him so naturally rays
people fought bitterly about the weight
despite the fact that miller had scored
a technical knockout in their first meet-
ing he didnt want to give away gobs of
poundage the young man had a high
regard for mclarnins ability

  finally they came to an agreement it
was much too profitable a match to be
spoiled by even so important a matter as
weight ray realized that the advantage
was with him anyway even if he were
beaten he would lose no prestige this
match was between a lightweight and a
welterweight jack dempsey who had
begun to promote bouts in chicago was

anxious to stage one between miller and
sammy mandell with the title of the
-pound class at stake

  if he could have done so immediately
after ray had stopped mclarnin it
would have been a huge money-maker
that wasnt possible however but if
the left hook specialist made a good
showing this time the possibility of a
profit still existed so dempsey went
to miller and offered him a date with
mandell if he was on his feet at the
end of his battle with mclarnin

  that offer did more than anything
else to spoil what should have been a
really great fight ray was not a
cautious fighter under normal condi-
tions he had always been willing to
take a chance now however too much
hinged on his showing to permit him
to take a chance had he gone out and
fought mclarnin as he did in their
first meeting it would have been a swell
battle and everyone would have been
satisfied

  instead he had dempseys offer on
his mind a fight with mandell for the
lightweight championship of the world
he must be on his feet to get it if
mclarnin clipped him with that right
hand it would ruin everything so the
little chicago puncher went into the
ring with the single idea in mind of
playing safe he wouldnt give jimmy
a shot at his chin no matter what hap-
pened he was going to earn that bid

  well the inevitable happened of
course miller played too safe he
wouldnt take any sort of a chance he
kept in his shell from start to finish it
must be admitted that jimmy was none
too hot himself as the saying is he
had a poor night and combined with
rays safety first tactics the most bally-
hooed bout between little men in years
fizzled off into an uninteresting ten
round you-grab-me-and-ril-grab-you af-
fair

  the gate was a vast one and the re-
turns for both fighters top-notch it
was too bad that their performance was
so disappointing as ft happened


fight stories

miller didnt get his big chance with
mandell after all for dempsey decided
not to go through with the bout if
kay had gone in traded with mclarnin
and fought a slashing battle whether he
won or lost he would have been better
off

  jimmy however hadnt lost any of
his popularity in new york getting
men who had a chance with him was
quite a different matter or even men who
wanted to take a chance with him the
life of a matchmaker is full of troubles
and problems this fellow wont fight
that one or the other chap wants so
much money that there is no sense in
putting him on it would have been
good business for madison square
garden to feature jimmy mclarnin at
least once a month but where could you
find enough opponents you couldnt
that was the answer

  tom mcardle kept looking around
fighters who didnt have a chance and
had nothing to lose by being knocked
out were quite willing to accept an as-
signment if they were well paid for their
pains but fellows like that were not
drawing cards much as the fans wanted
to see jimmy in action they didnt want
to see him against some helpless push-
over who couldnt have won if he went
into the ring with a butchers cleaver in
each hand

  then a happy thought came to the
harassed mr mcardle

  he had the right fellow now by gosh
paired with mclarnin the garden
wouldnt be big enough to hold the
crowd

  ruby goldstein

chapter ix

the jewel of the ghetto

ruby goldstein was one of
the most amazing figures the prize
ring ever saw he was a modest
brown-eyed boyish youngster who had
learned to box and play basketball in

the henry street settlement on the
east side he had every apparent
requisite to become one of the greatest
lightweights of all time he boxed bril-
liantly and was a deadly hitter at the
start of his career he had scored twenty
straight victories fourteen by knock-
outs when he was matched with ace
hudkins at coney island

  he gave hudkins a fine trouncing
for three rounds and in the fourth
dropped him but the rugged nebraska
wildcat climbed to his feet and knocked
ruby out with a terrific smash to the
chin

  goldstein started all over again he
flattened pete petrolle sig keppen
johnny ceccolli and ray mitchell and
gave jimmy goodrich a fine pasting
then he met sid terris and the drama
with hudkins was reenacted these
setbacks apparently ruined rubys in-
terest he fought only occasionally
signed for bouts and ran out on them
though only twenty-three years old
it looked as though his ring career was
over he had saved fifty thousand dol-
lars and had about decided to enter
some business and forget the gloves al-
together wheti he met a girl

  she was of his own people and his
own neighborhood it galled her that
ruby goldstein should be called a quit-
ter she urged him to go back into the
game to make good for her sake if not
his own this time so at the start of
 the mild mr goldstein renewed
his campaign for greatness

  in quick succession he stopped
freddy mueller joe reno joey kauff-
man cuddy demarco and billy drako
no great fighters among them true
enough but they were veterans who
knew how to take care of themselves
ruby looked so good that his partisans
flocked to him once more he had failed
them in his two biggest shots but he
wouldnt fail them now ruby gold-
stein was a second benny leonard and
hed prove it

  so a match was made with jimmy
mclarnin
the baby-face terror



  the east side was more than hope-
ful it was willing to bet that its idol
had been made over a girl had done
it no more debacles like those with
hudkins and terris goldstein was
really on the road now the news-
paper observers and the bettors were
not so optimistic they were not con-
vinced that the intuitive fighting spirit
the jewel of the ghetto had lacked in
other encounters could be supplied
overnight in this way

  the intimation was not that goldstein
lacked courage it wasnt that it was
rather a lack of competitive spirit
ruby could be brave enough but sim-
ply could not whip himself to his high-
est pitch when most was demanded of
him had he possessed that attribute
he might have gone on to a champion-
ship for he had every physical asset

  mclarnin a student of the opposi-
tion he was called upon to face did
not believe that ruby had changed he
believed that the boy would be frozen
with stage fright at the very beginning
of the battle if he succeeded in get-
ting by a few rounds he might find a
new esprit he would become more
and more dangerous with the passing
moments the thing to do would be to
overwhelm him at the start not give
him a chance to get set batter and
smash and hack the heart out of him

  despite the fact that jimmy was a
-to-l favorite and was generally
tabbed to win by a knockout the bout
excited the greatest attention in new
york the east side has always stood
staunchly by its own it stood now by
ruby hoping against hope the aver-
age ring fan who knew that goldstein
could hit with anyone of his weight
knew that when two punchers get to-
gether drama hangs breathless in the
balance so madison square garden
was packed the night jimmy mclarnin
and ruby goldstein met

  baby face came with pop foster
and that cagey old second doc bagley
the jewel of the ghetto was backed by
abe attell and whitey bimstein mas-

ters of the corners ruby was solemn
almost frightened looking jimmy
smiled a little this might very easily
be the easiest fight of his life-or the
toughest he couldnt know in advance
but he did know that no one who could
punch as goldstein could should be
rated as a set-up

  hadnt this soft-eyed boy put ace
hudkins on the floor and was there a
tougher soul on all the green footstool
than this same hudkins ruby could
blast with either hand and there was no
guesswork about that

  baby face looked across at his rivals
corner attell and whitey were laugh-
ing and patting goldstein on the back
trying to laugh some confidence into
him thats what they were doing
before leaving his dressing-room ruby
had told some of the newspapermen that
he would win by a knockout in four or
five rounds he didnt believe that
himself

  theres the bell

goldstein danced out jabbing
straight as a lance a good-looking
boy jimmy in a crouch his lips
drawn back from his white teeth pro-
tector waded in grimly it was ap-
parent that ruby was nervous he
jabbed and jumped away before a re-
turn could be made mclarnin rushed
swinging he missed ruby poked with
another jab and sprinted off high on
the balls of his feet there was no
power in his jabs they were merely
tentative pokes

 jimmy kept pressing in bang
theres the right how do you like
that mister goldsteins down the
garden is filled with a bedlam of
screams goldstein down on his
haunches dazed and frightened a look
of appeal in his brown eyes why
should you hurt me    why   
hes up again dancing away poking
frantically with his left in an effort to
keep off the merciless irish boy keep
him off you cant do it yes gold-
stein is the same fighter he always was


fight stories

a champion against the second-raters
a second-rater against the champions
why cant he keep his head and his
nerves  hes good enough to box with
anybody but look at him all at loose
ends he cant do anything right one
knockdown might not mean anything
with some men but its the finish with
him no matter what happens after-
ward that first knockdown was the real
finish

  look at mclarnin drive him to the
ropes cover up ruby cover up-
whats the matter oh    oh   
the bell

  there was a vast sigh of relief from
the galleries where goldsteins friends
were packed he was past the first
round maybe in this minutes rest he
would find himself maybe he would
get over the palsy that gripped his
muscles in this big moment if he did
he yet might beat mclarnin his sec-
onds are working desperately theyre
talking to him-abe attell who was
one of the greatest featherweight cham-
pions that ever lived whitey who has
few superiors as a second theyre try-
ing to inject some of their own spirit
in him come on ruby get your-
self together your girl your friends
-everybody is watching    beat
this guy and youll be in the million-
dollar class untrack yourself he
aint got nothin that you aint got   
come on baby    fight

  ruby went out to give the best he
had he met a tigerish boy who with
head down and fists flying drove him
to the ropes nothing goldstein could
do was enough to keep mclarnin off
jimmy was certain of himself the
smell of victory was in his nostrils a
smashing right knocked ruby through
the ropes

  he lay on the rim of the ring outside
the ropes and started to roll onto the
newspapermen they held up their
hands to protect themselves referee
magnolia rushed over and shouted
dont hold him up

  we gave him the horse-laugh what

are we supposed to do lou-let tins
fellow fall down our throats we
didnt shove goldstein up but we did
stop him from caroming off our type-
writers

  dont let anyone say that ruby gold-
stein isnt game i was in that group
when the jewel was propelled out among
us his eyes were staring he was des-
perately hurt almost unconscious yet
he reached out for the bottom strand of
the ropes his gloved hand found it
somehow and he hauled himself up and
through

on the floor of the ring once again
he heard referee magnolia counting
  six    seven    eight   

  ruby goldstein came swayingly to
his feet

  a man who wasnt game would have
stayed down there wasnt a chance
for him-not a single solitary chance
in the world all that could possibly
happen when he did get up was for
jimmy mclarnin to hit him again and
knock him out those who said that
ruby goldstein lacked courage saw him
get up and with the fighters instinct
go forward into a blasting right hander
that knocked him flat  his back

   he lay there arms outflung his eyes
closed he made no effort to get up
because he was stone cold he didnt
hear the toll of the seconds that marked
his complete passing as a star fighter
he heard nothing at all

   he had failed to prove to the girl of
his heart that he deserved to be ranked
with the great fighting men of his day
but he did prove one thing he showed
the world that he was game that what-
ever his faults as a ringman lack of
courage was not one of them

  jimmy watched the closing of the
drama with a queer twisted little smile
he felt more sorry for goldstein than
for any man he had ever beaten it
would have meant so much for ruby to
win

  baby face turned his usual hand-
spring and then walked over to shake
hands with the jewel of the ghetto
the baby-face terror



goldstein was just coining out of it he
looked up at mclarnin and smiled
wanly

  im sorry said jim

  thats all right said ruby i
guess it was in the book

chapter x
a coming champ

the welterweight class had taken a
new lease on life since the passing
of joe dundee as champion the lan-
tern-jawed baltimorean had guarded his
title so carefully permitting no one a
shot at it that interest in the division
had waned when jackie fields finally
won it that interest flamed up again

 fields jimmy mclarnin had
knocked him out in a couple of rounds
when they were both kids-remember
a bout between them was a natural for
the outdoors a bout that would draw
several hundred thousand dollars

  in the meantime there were plenty of
welterweights to keep jimmy busy one
was young jack thompson whom tom
mcardle matchmaker at the garden
was anxious to toss in with jimmy
thompson was a slim brown panther
of a man a fine boxer and a hard hitter
he had knocked out joe dundee in two
rounds and had stopped harry kid
brown jack silver red herring
harry dudley johnny adams russie
leroy and others a sweet fighter
and one who had never shown his wares
in new york

  sometimes it is almost incredible to
me how the bookmakers figure the
chances of rival fighters jimmy mc-
larnin is undoubtedly one of the best
fighting men inch for inch that the
modern game has seen he can punch
and box has courage brains and ring
instinct in short he is everything a
good fighter should be

  all that is admitted but jack thomp-
sons record showed that he was a star
in his own right he had beaten many

good men how in the name of com-
mon sense mclarnin could be quoted
as a four-to-one favorite is almost im-
possible to understand no one as good
as thompson should be on the short
end of four-to-one against any man of
his weight it isnt in the cards yet
that is exactly how they figured the
brown mans chances

  this is what happened

  as is usually the case when jimmy
fights the garden was packed the
crowd was crazy about him it gave
thompson a good hand too consider-
ing the tact that he was totally unknown
in those parts

  they traded pretty evenly in the first
round jack showed himself a good
boxer a snappy hitter and a smart ring-
man he found out very soon that the
best way to counteract jimmys terrific
blows was to keep crowding so that he
couldnt get entirely set

  he won the second round after tak-
ing a few solid belts around the waist-
line whipping in a fast uppercut that
had plenty of damage in it mclarnin
landed one right-hander high on the
brown boys head-and snap his hand
went jimmy felt the bone break on an
old injury the pain was numbing
he knew that except for defense the
fist would be useless for the remainder
of the fight thompson would soon
find out that something was wrong to
counteract the loss of that weapon
jimmy stepped faster he won the
third and fourth carrying the fight to
thompson and lashing away with his
left hook while making threatening ges-
tures with the right jack wasnt hurt
he drifted about like a brown shadow
and rolled with the blows that landed-
a boxer who knew what it was all about

  then the brown man sensing what
was the matter went out himself he
tore into jimmy like a tiger mclar-
nins nose was cut he swung wildly
at the body and was warned by the ref-
eree thompsons seconds urged him
to be more careful but he believed that
he had a chance to knock out the good-


fight stories

looking white boy and put himself in
the big money at the end of the sev-
enth round he had a distinct edge

  youll have to step out jimmy
said pop you aint goin so well
this thompson guy has something on
you up to now you ought to be able
to beat him with your left get started
now

  ill do just that said jimmy his
lips tightening

  so in the eighth round he took the
play out of jack thompsons hand he
bluffed with his right missing always
but wreaking execution with his left
just as the bell sounded for the eighth
and ninth rounds he let fly with the in-
jured fist landing on the body

  that made the whole fight pretty even
as they waited to go out for the final
round the winner of those last three
minutes of struggle would come pretty
close to earning the decision both men
knew that i think jimmy did at any
rate he was a good judge of pace
he always knew to a fine point what
was needed of him and he understood
just as well what he was capable of
doing he had enough stuff left to carry
things to young jack thompson he
was still strong and able even though
his right hand was swollen and painful
with both fists working mclarnin was
certain that he would have won easily
possibly have knocked out this slim pan-
ther but beating a good two-handed
fighter with one hand is a job for a
master the last round would be hot

  if the broken digit had to go-well
let it go being beaten by thompson
at this stage of the proceedings would
be fatal it would cast a pall over a
fields-mclaruin battle for the welter-
weight championship of the world it
would be the greatest set-back jimmy
had ever run into that last round must
go to him nothing else was conceiv-
able the bell sent them out

jimmy roared and slashed and raved
he hit with both hands the left to
the head and the right to the body pain

was nothing bursting straining lungs
were nothing he kept close to thomp-
son he never let the brown-skinned
body dance away out of danger he
hung on like a leech pounding pound-
ing

  thompson fine fighter that he was
failed to stem the tide he couldnt
get set for his own punches the play
was taken out of his hands the rip-
ping attack of the irish boy drove him
like a leaf before the gale time after
time he stood up to the punches trying
to break through with his own batteries
but the hammering was too much for
him it would have been too much i
think for any welterweight in the
world mclarnin was fighting mad
ready to throw away his future if need
be to win this fight

  the last gong sounded in the midst
of a roar from the spectators that
was a champions finish no one could
dispute it it was a winners finish too
and was enough to snatch the decision
out of thompsons waiting hands

  they clapped each other on the back
and went to their corners to await the
official decision from joe humphries
when joe had collected the slips from
the judges and referee he walked over
to mclarnin and lifted his soaked glove
in the age-old token of victory

  it was one of the most popular deci-
sions ever given in the garden the
idol of the fans had snatched it from
the burning when it seemed that defeat
must be his portion it should have
been a lesson too to those optimists
who bet four-to-one that thompson
would lose there is no such thing as
a four-to-one shot when two first-class
fighting men face each other in the ring

  we must leave jimmy mclarnin at
this stage of his career still a young-
ster the greatest years of his fighting
life should lay before him when he
finally hangs up his gloves for the last
time he will-with a smile from the
fates-have compiled a record worthy
of standing with the historic ones of the
ring

socker

dooley

fighting

golfer

   by charles
   francis coe

this time his squared circle was a
golf links the bright sun his spot-
light and on his ability to sock a
little white ball rested his reputation
as a mauler of men

it was artie coombss big idea he
thought it would yank socker
dooley back into the spotlight and
it did appear to be one of those thoughts
that seem fated to lead somewhere from
the very beginning socker was a fad-
ing pugilist with a wonderful future
behind him and therefore not anything
to be raved about as a source of news
publicity was hard for him to get ex-
cept on fight night

  artie was a press agent with ideals
by that we mean that artie went after
results with both hands and feet and
really felt that he was slipping badly
in the ethics of his profession if he
failed to think up a story big enough to
pass the blue pencil as news and
he seldom slipped

  this celerity was due largely to two
things artie was about as nice a little
fellow as the law allows and he had as
breezy a smile as any living man then
too he really had an inventive turn to
that mind of his which made up good
stuff for any ones newspaper

  once let artie roll into an editors

presence with the silk handkerchief
hanging so far out of his breast pocket
that he seemed to be in danger of trip-
ping over it his smile working overtime
and his story all neatly typed and held
in his left hand while his right grasped
that of the victim and something was
going to be printed

  then knowing artie will enable you
to understand coming events

  the big idea appeared in the form of
a story which had socker dooley tak-
ing up the gentle and aristocratic game
of golf ordinarily fighters dont go
in for that sort of thing which accounts
for the story artie never did anything
ordinary

  the reason i wrote that he ex-
plained to socker after the damage had
been done was that a different type of
people is becoming interested in your
manly profession ladies are attending
bouts business men go openly and in-
vite their friends fighting is getting
to be like singing in opera or playing
baseball you must have public ap-
peal the only place yon can read about




fight stories

babe ruths baseball playing is in the
score but you can see his sudbury
swish hound on the front page and find
out all about his lumbago and his bridge
playing in the columns once given to
news

  why folks like to see him and get
acquainted through the papers with
what sort of a guy he really is thats
what keeps us guys alive

yeah- know-but gulf expos-
tulated socker feelingly i-

  for the love of mike dont say gulf
its golf r

  awright then-gulf my gosh i
cant even say it iiow can i play it
well when i wrote the yarn i didnt
think youd have to play it you wanted
to get on the front pages and that was
the only thing that would do it i had
no idea this red mulrain would see a
chance to put his pork and beaner across
with us

  hes a wise guy i shoulda had me
a manager like that guy he seen me
goin over on th story an comes back
with a challenge for me to play his
fighter a game of gulf now i either
play or get called yellow

  well maybe this jimmie mckone
cant play it any better than you

  im bettin he cant play no worse
  who is he

  hes th coast heavyweight champ-
whatever that means i aint sayin he
aint a good guy an all that-but them
that knows him says hes toughern
cafeteria beef an has a heart full of
flint

  well this looks to me like a play on
their part to cash in a bit on your pub-
licity i admit it is an unlooked for and
unusual development but let me get in
touch with this red person and see what
i can fix up

  dont get me on no gulf grounds
socker admonishe i as a parting shot

but the worst was found to be true
when artie had finished his investi-
gation he returned to report that red
was adamant his heart was set upon

going through with the first real break
that had come his way he and mckone
had been in the east for two months
contending themselves with liners on the
sport pages this was different they
were in the headlines now and meant to
stay there as long as luck held good

  jimmie mckone tough and un-
suspecting had gone out to a public
course watched a few people drive and
putt and convinced himself that he was
safe enough at the game it looked
rather tasteless and unexciting to him
but had every indication of being easy
to play

  and weve got to go through
socker admitted artie red has got
tommie silver as a press agent and
hes pretty good next to me in fact
hes bound to get the story over and
they are going to challenge us in the
morning papers theres no way out
weve got to play

  i know a way out snarled socker
reaching for his hat

  wait dont get into a jam over this
thing we wont get anywhere that
way dont argue with them

  argue  i aint gonna argue kid
im gonna crease his dial no cripple
can play gulf-

  and have the papers full of your
ducking the match by licking this fellow
outside the ring all that does is show
you up for a roughneck and we lose all
weve gained theres a better way
than that-just give me time to think
of it

  there aint no better way in th
world of fixin up a guy like him than
bouncin knuckles oflrn his whiskers
but even before socker had finished
it was evident that artie had the idea
his face broke into a smile with the
radiance of a sunrise he slammed one
fist into the palm of his other hand
then fired questions like a machine gun
how much does this mckone
weigh 

  about one ninety

  hes in your class isnt he
  yeah
socker dooley fighting golfer



  you are a fair and reasonable match
in the ring

  id probly knock him for an ingloo
in about four rounds if i was right-
but you might be matched i mean
you could be so far as weights and that
stuff is concerned hes as big as you
are 

  sure now your talkin get us
matched up in the ring i can eat them
readin about meself playin gulf
wouldnt feed me

  no no socker you dont get the
idea at all ive found the way out of
this mess and at the same time well get
a whole flock of stories on the side

  i wont have to play gulf

 no when they hear this come-
back watch them wiggle out of the golf
match

immediately artie retired to his
typewriter and dashed off a rather
amazing affair for the response to the
challenge which wras due in the morn-
ing something made artie sing and
whistle as he worked that day even a
press agent loves something real to
write about and this time artie had it

  the first issues of the next morning
carried considerable of a story socker
read it with deep concern if insufficient
ardor jimmie mckone deliberately
called the bluff of socker dooley and
challenged him outright to a match of
eighteen holes for any stake socker
cared to name there was a lot more
but that was the import of the whole
thing

  then came the afternoon papers
they disclosed in artie coombs that
master sort of mind which asserts itself
in the pinch not only did socker
dooley accept the ill-advised and mis-
guided challenge of the said mckone
no not only that lie named the stakes
as well-and the scene of the match
read it in arties own words

when notified of the challenge of mckone
socker dooley smiled tolerantly and nodded a
quick acceptance but it took a lot of thought
on the part of the famous ringster to deter-
fight-sept-

mine upon a fair stake to be played for

  that he retained his shrewd faculties out-
side the rings that have made him famous is
attested by the decision he finaljy reached
and according to the terms of the challenge
he is in position to enforce or claim the match
by default

  sure ill play jimmie well make it one
week from today rain or shine and the
game to be played over the municipal links
as for stakes im dead game though i dont
claim to be a star golfer since jimmie and
i are both workers of the hands i think we
should satisfy the public by playing the match
for a punch a hole in other words every
hole he wins he earns a punch at tnc-and
every hole i beat him-he tastes of the sock
that won me my namel

  the public read this with a thrill
artie with an infinite sense of achieve-
ment red mulrain and jimmie mc-
kone with portentous doubts and
socker dooley with high blood pressure
and a determination to kill artie 
sight

  dont fly off the handle socker
shouted the latter as socker charged
into his office cant you see that was
the one way out of the match 

  socker saw a grin spread over his
face

  thats right artie the relief was
so great that socker sank into a chair
and fanned himself with his cap sure
i see it now

 of course they never in the
world could agree to such terms yet
you get a lot of credit for naming them
not so bad eh  they cant accept
they wouldnt dare and yet we get the
space and the credit im going to make
considerable of a guy of you yet
socker

  both grinned and indulged in one of
those little mutual admiration societies
that make life agreeable they mutually
admired for the better part of an hour
and might still have been at it but for
the sudden and impetuous appearance
of tommie silver he rushed across
to them in a high state of excitement

  youre took up youre took up
socker red and jimmie mckone has
agreed to the match its the greatest
morsel for a press agent that the well
known profession can boast of-hop to


fight stories

it artie you and me has got some-
thing to write about this time

the first tee at the municipal links
was as warm with people extra
police had been detailed

  will they really do it was the
question on every lip

  pandemonium broke loose when the
bulk of socker dooley stepped from a
car that had been rented for the occa-
sion and walked through the crowd to
the tee at his side strode artie aburst
with importance and behind him came
a caddie lugging a bag of borrowed
clubs a close observer might have seen
in the battered eyes of the ring hero the
sort of courageous determination which
characterized the martyr-or bride-
groom he was not unmindful of that
which lay before him but faltered not
despite it

  a well known sports writer stepped
up to artie

  ive been drawn as scorer for
socker i follow jimmie around the
course and see that his game conforms
to the letter of the law mr williams
here will represent mckone and follow
socker

  fine i am more than sure that
socker will have a square deal wheres
mckone

  here he comes now

  all eyes turned toward the coast
heavyweight

  he swaggered onto the tee with the
stride and nonchalance of a first class
lion-tamer glanced casually about until
he saw socker then strode over and
held forth his hands for inspection
socker did likewise and the motion went
for a handshake those who have fol-
lowed the ring got a real smile out of
that

  it aint your lunch hooks im wantin
to see socker grunted lip protec-
tors dont go in gulf either open your

yap-

  with deep concern each examined the
mouth of the other then ran his hands
over the body to detect any padding

that might have the effect of easing the
strain of the pending golf match

  which corner you want asked
mckone

  there aint none well toss to see
who whales away first

  one of the scorers tossed a coin and
socker called heads he won the
honor was his dubious but his

  guess were all set to go he said
hand me th whacker kid

  little bobbie aldrich always did have
a lot of sense for a kid so he drew
forth the driver and handed the ringster
a ball

  take a little sand out f that box
socker he coached make a tee set
the ball on it and take your time dont
press and be sure to keep your eye on
the ball

  watch me go kid im gonna bust
that pill where its tender

socker made the tee and stood the
ball upon it then he took the
driver and assumed his stance for a
wholly extemporaneous one it wasnt
bad true he took hold of the club
like a bat and glared at the ball with a
venomous purposefulness the crowd
milled and whispered that disturbed
artie

  fore he called sharply

  how do you make that out de-
manded socker i aint even had one
swipe at it yet

  never mind socker i wasnt talk-
ing to you everything is all right you
just play the game lay her right down
the middle old boy nice and firm but
dont press

  once again socker turned to the busi-
ness in hand he waved the club men-
acingly cast his huge arms upward
whirled like a dervish and flailed away
there came a shower of dust and the
muffled report of club against ball
then a deadly silence

  where is it  socker asked i hit
it an awful belt

  but not a man in the crowd could an-
swer a second before the ball had
socker dooley fighting golfer



been there now it was gone for at
least twenty seconds there was complete
bafflement then there came a dull thud
and the ball rolled back onto the tee
all eyes turned toward the sound they
saw red mulrain reeling around with
one hand clapped to the top of his head
and his knees wabbling like the legs of
a country hotel bureau

  foul foul the manager mumbled
th things a plant then as his
faculties returned somewhat he charged
at socker and only a burly sergeant of
police cheated the crowd out of some
real fun

  its all right red one of the sports
writers assured him it just happened
ive seen a dozen balls hit that way
socker didnt mean it

  the official scorer marked down one
stroke for socker and the job was up
to jimmie mckone

  the trouble with that shot was that
you stood too close to the ball after hit-
ting it socker grinned artie no
man could be a press agent without a
sense of humor and with all the en-
ergy socker had put into that shot the
ball now lay some ten feet away

  but things quickly adjusted them-
selves jimmie took three swings in
rapid succession which means that the
first two missed entirely the third
darted happily off the toe of the club
and was saved from a long flight out of
bounds only by the interference of a
bench

  every one saw the bench stop the
ball the pellet hit the boards and shot
straight up into the air pretty lucky
grinned a spectator but almost as
though the remark had tempted fate
the ball dropped again to the bench and
then took a graceful little loop straight
into the bucket of water on the first tec

  play it out play it out shrieked
the watchful artie its a fair hazard

  lengthy conference decided that
artie was right jimmie took his driver
mounted the bench and took one lusty
whale at the bucket the bottom sprung
loose and a stream of dirty water

trickled forth but the ball remained

secure

  rather than dwell upon detail we will
quote results when finally jimmie was
clear of the bucket and his ball once
more lay in the fair he had taken eight-
een strokes and been presented with a
summons for destruction of public
property

  but they were off down the fair-
way beckoned the velvety green where
the two must soon pay for their folly
or collect their just reward

  dooley away chanted the scorer

try an get me away after that
guy loses out before he gets started

  no no socker he means you are
farther from the hole than mckone so
you shoot now explained artie

  dont use that same stick socker
little bobbie coached take this mid-
iron and dont try to hit it hard just
dribble along to the green you got it
won now

  but sockers idea was for the spectac-
ular with a margin in his favor such
as he had disaster seemed endlessly
distant

   all i gotta do is win the first hole
that gives me a sock at this ginks
chatter channel after that he wont
even see a ball

  you cant tell socker warned
artie he looks pretty tough

  yeah but ill just miss his chin far
enough to close his eyes how can he
hit that dodgin domino with his eyes
shut  i cant with em open 

socker took the iron waved it
carefully and planned his shot he
heard bobbie urge that he keep his left
arm straight and keep his head down
he did both he swung and the ball
began a flight that would have made
sarazen green with envy true and far
it sped the crowd gasped in amaze-
ment at its marvelous soaring watched
breathless until it finally landed dead
center of the fairway and leaped grace-
fully toward the green

oh now i get the idea better


fight stories

nodded socker i got th secret now

  he followed along as the perspiring
jimmie took lour more shots to catch
up with him socker lay two jimmie
twenty-two things looked sweet for
the vet

  th first hole was for a smash on th
chin jimmie socker reminded his
rival as they tiearcd the green

  id rather take it than try to hit that
fool ball any more  told red he was
carryin a yegg into church when he gets
me onto this daisy an dandelion em-
porium

  sockcr grinned all confidence now
he stepped up to his ball looked calmly
at the green and repeated as he thought
his last shot and it looked as though
he had for a moment the ball started
out well but suddenly seemed attracted
by something off its course in a wide
but rapid sweep it curved to the
right

  after that it curved some more and
then kept on curving in an ever increas-
ing scope until the ground under its
flight ceased to be the smooth open fair-
way and altered into stubble then
rough of a menacing nature and
finally into wavy long sward

  socker watched this unexpected de-
velopment in somewhat awed amaze-
ment never had he seen such a queer
doings ilis mental category had failed
to embrace such a thing as a slice and
as for the physics back of it-well
back to the old gentleman under the
apple tree the only difference is that
the fruit missed socker

  is there sumthin up there he
gasped as if trying to determine the
cause of the unfortunate phenomena his
eyes remained fixed in an effort to trace
the tiling to its source

  good night cried bobbie aldrich
well be lucky to find that at all
thats a terrible place

  he done sumthin to me ball thats
what he done socker suspected any
one at a time like this

and to make matters worse an extra
caddie appeared at that moment carry-

ing a large square box somehow it
was familiar to socker

  the lad walked straight up to the
police sergeant and offered the box for
inspection then socker saw what it
was a set of boxing gloves

  the only way you can pull off this nut
idea is in conformity with the law the
official announced i can see that one
of you swamp rats is due for a sweet
pasting in another hundred yards and i
wont stand for bare knuckles

  they trooped excitedly to the point
where the ball had seemed to land the
most interested parties arrived first fol-
lowed by about a thousand of the gal-
lery a lost ball is ever a source of
worry and dismay but in this case it
was destined to delay arrival at the
green and that crowd was anxious to
see the first score paid

  you have five minutes in which to
find your ball jimmies scorer an-
nounced if in that time you have not
succeeded you lose the hole this is
match play

  they hunted feverishly for three of
the precious five at the end of that
time they were exactly where they
started and socker was showing con-
siderable concern then it was that
arties fertile brain began to work he
sidled about until he secured another
ball which he secreted in the palm of
his hand

  four minutes came and went and the
gloating look upon the face of red
mulrain enraged socker to the point of
destruction four and a half minutes
-then a shout from artie

  here it is-i have it

  every one rushed toward him and
socker heaved a sigh of infinite relief

  its a lie shouted the suddenly in-
furiated red mulrain i been stand-
in on his ball for three minutes

once more the police prevented
sudden death socker did his best
to get at red but to no avail and
when he did finally place himself for
the next shot he was dismayed to find
socker dooley fighting golfer



his ball ground so deep into the clinging
grass and soggy earth that he couldnt
hit it

  there was endless argument but no
final decision any ruling was a pre-
cedent both scorers begged the ques-
tion it all comes down to the fact
that golf is supposed to be a gentle-
mans game and its catching some ter-
rible abuse around here one of them
declared play the shot as it lies and
if you lose the hole you can protest

  socker began whittling away it was
incomprehensibly arduous and unprofit-
able his shoulders were draped with
grass his mouth was filled with flying
mud and his muffled curses and strokes
plenteous before he found the ball once
more on the fairway

  mckone is away said the scorer
ultimately socker welcomed the breath-
ing space shoot mckone you lie
twenty-two-dooley twenty-six 

  my gosh an they call this gulf a
game

  ten minutes later-forty since leav-
ing the tee both men got onto the green
jimmie lay thirty-nine while the best
that could be counted for socker was a
snappy forty

  jimmie was away using the same
swing as he juggled with his driver he
putted the ball gyrated across the
green in the general direction of the
cup but so far past it that he still was
away

  again he putted this time the gal-
leries held their breath for better than
twenty feet the ball rolled true on its
course to the cup then it stopped but
even so it hung on the very lip of the
cup that left jimmie a clean forty-
two for by no conceivable chance could
he miss his next shot

  it also meant that socker had to sink
a fifteen foot putt in one to win or
two to halve

  under the dutiful and not inexpert
guidance of bobbie aldrich socker
planned his shot very carefully he
swung the crowd gasped in astonish-
ment straight as a die the ball coursed

over the green right up to the cup-
where it collided with jimmies with
the gentleness of a downy caress and
glanced off to the left

  but jimmies ball did not glance no
it teetered a fraction of a second then
dropped neatly into the cup jimmie
had won on sockers shot j immie was
down in forty-one with a yell of de-
light he motioned the police officer and
began swinging his arm by way of tun-
ing up

  for a hazy moment socker hesitated
then he strode across the green and
held forth his chin while a big glove
was slipped onto jimmies mitt

  while the crowd held its breath in
expectancy jimmie measured his man
putting every ounce of his experience
and strength into the move he drove
his right fist against the dooley jaw it
was a prodigious wallop

  good night he busted his jaw
bone gasped a spectator

  he did not yelped red mulrain
who saw that socker had managed to
take the blow and keep his feet he
near missed him thats what he done
all you heard was his knees knockin
together-that wasnt no bone break-
in some men cannot hide disap-
pointment

  how many holes did you say there
was to this ga-ame artie socker
mumbled thickly

  one of the gallery laughed raucously
which had the effect of bringing socker
back to earth lie saw at once that his
standing was being impugned not
openly by direct declaration but by in-
sidious innuendoes

  turning upon jimmie mckone he
burst forth in justified anger

   sall right kid come on to th
next hole an dont forgit that sock
you gimme dont count you neednt
bank nothin on it either i got a pro-
test coinin

ive thirty p m

  a weary ibut intensely excited
throng jams about the eleventh tee and


fight stories

lines the eleventh fairway pushing and
hauling its way to points of vantage
extra traffic officers are swinging their
arms in frenzied directions at all points
approaching the course reserves sur-
round the battered principals in the golf
match of the century

  on the tee socker steps up for the
honor one eye is closed and his lips
are thick and bruised while he tees
his ball red mulrain approaches the tee
bucket and dips a towel into the sandy
water with this he sponges the face
of the illustrious jimmie mckone
jimmie looks like an infant dinosaur
that has been inadvertently stepped
upon by all its ancestors at a family
gathering the bridge of his nose is
so swollen and only half his ears
show

  obviously he is a man who is caught
out of his element

  socker hesitated a moment then
turned to the scores with a query
lemme get this straight th guy
that wins th next hole gets four socks
at th other one-

  correct you have agreed to syndi-
cate the bets and you halved the last
four holes

  right

  again he addresses the ball hesitates
turns once more-

  an were bettin on th side jimmie
that th next time were matched up i
gets a pound extra weight weighin in
for each shot on this hole that is better
than yourti-

  an i gits th same from you
  right

  socker regards the hole before him
though his visual concept of things
generally is distorted he sees at once
that the green is much nearer the tee
than usually has been the case

  a short hole whispered the faith-
ful though terrified bobby dont
miss this shot play it easy keep your
head down and dont bend your left
arm

  socker nodded and swung careful
analysis of the official scores afterward

showed that it was his six hundred and
eighth shot for the day with this in
mind it may be attributed to the natural
law of averages that is for you to
decide we are merely chronicling
events

  suffice it to say that the ball rose in a
magnificent arc glistened momentarily
jn the fading sun dropped to the
ground close to the green took a
weird but fascinating hop in the
right direction-and rolled into the
hole

  down in one screamed a scorer
bobbie aldrich kicked his heels together
and did a back flip forgetful of all else
artie coombs reached for a pencil and
red mulrain and jimmie mckone con-
tributed a harmonized gurgle and
wheeze respectively

  socker had achieved the ambition of
every golfer extant it was several sec-
onds before he realized the extent of
his good fortune then he grinned
slowly almost torturously with his
swollen lips and turned toward his
enemy

  laugh that off wilbur-go ahead
make a wise-crack

  but jimmie was game he rose to
the occasion seizing his driver he teed
the ball and swung blindly but noth-
ing happened the ball reposed upon
the tee after the memorable match had
been won and lost whereas socker
dooley had made a hole in one jimmie
mckone immersed himself in the
depths of golf humiliation by missing
the ball entirely

  dooley wins the hole the syndicate
jbet and a pound of flesh when they
meet in the prize ring announced the
scorer

  jimmie mckone turned from the tee
he did his best to recognize folks over
the bridge of his nose but gave it up
as a bad job all he could see of the
man before him was the rim of his hat
it had been a tough golf match thus
far

  well come an take it socker he
invited gamely
socker dooley fighting golfer



socker had the glove on and ready
he stepped up and with his left
hand tilted the battered chin upon which
he was to wreak vengeance when the
angle was exactly to his liking he let
drive

  the glove was big but the sound of
the fist within its folds could he de-
tected for several feet jimmie folded
under the impact like a tent in a gale
but he rose shortly to face the medicine
again socker socked and it was on
the order of the old sock that had
made him famous too jimmies gar-
ters just withered away from the clout
he took it was longer this time that
he took to rise

  the third time jimmie took it he
didnt suffer much it was as though
he had been drugged and didnt mind
one can form any kind of a habit in
these prohibitory days and jimmie had
had a lot of practice that afternoon

  stay with im jimmie red mul-
rain warned sonorously im right
with you here ole boy dont quit to
th big punk

  but jimmie had thought things out
a bit he got so far as to raise him-
self on one knee then rolled back onto
the ground

  you win socker he muttered
hazily take it from a guy as knows
-youre th greatest gulfer in th

world there aint none like you
the glove slipped from sockers list
leaving the great bony knuckles ex-
posed before a man could move he
had driven home the fourth punch the
sound of it told eloquently of its power
the blissful snort that told of oblivion
for the stricken man proclaimed the
complete knockout

 then socker reached forth and
helped his vanquished foe to his feet

  i won that fourth sock fair an
square jimmie he apologized an i
had every right to take it so i did
sure-sall right socker no hard
feelins anyhow-i didnt even feci
it

  course you didnt grunted socker
cause i didnt slip it to you-i tucked
it under this red mulrains second
chin thats him under th bench
there he tells you youre partners so
i figgers its all fair an square if you
whacks up a bit

  jimmie grinned in spite of all his
woes

  im glad you handed it to him
socker he aint on th level with me
anyhow if he was i asks you now
socker if he was would he steered me
into a guy that plays th game of gulf
you do would he now

  he would like blazes agreed
socker

next month-another smashing adventure of socker dooley watch for it

adonis versus adonis

the recent bout between schaaf and loughran in philadelphia saw the
meeting of two of the best looking pugilists in the history of the game
both have been models for sculptors and painters both have been widely
praised by artists for physical perfection

   schaaf was selected by mahonri young famous sculptor as a model for
the tunney-muldoon trophy young pronounced the bostonian the most
perfectly proportioned boxer in the ring and stated that the tunney-
muldoon trophy which has won universal admiration is nothing more than
a copy of his physique

   loughran has been the subject of half a dozen sculptors and painters
and is frequently described as the philadelphia adonis
say it with haymakers

by joseph b fox

flash dowd there was a title threat for you-one sweet fighter who
said it with haymakers-until he went beauty-conscious then manager

bill purdy said it with flowers

a smashing right to the heart
and a left to the jaw knocked
butch bowers for a loop also
it boosted the man who delivered the
blows flash odowd into the pugilis-
tic spotlight more than this it made
odowds manager bill purdy happy-
which was a frame of mind he had not
enjoyed for some time

  with the knockout of bowers purdys
vision of handling a world champion
hovered before the rotund little fight
managers keen gray eyes this was the
great ambition of his life and with the
advent of flash in his stable the vision
grew brighter-for a time

  flash had always been ready to mix
with any and all of his class but after
his victory over bowers he began to
slow up thereafter he seemed content
to jab his way to tame victories purdys
vision dimmed and faded and with it
went his temper

  tonight three months after the
bowers victory flash had barely won
the nod over shifty crane and bill



purdy exasperated beyond further re-
straint could hold his tongue no longer

  for th love of little apples he
broke out as flash stood before his
mirror in the dressing-room after the
fight whats th matter with you
lately 

  who me asked flash after ad-
justing his tie to his satisfaction

  i wish youd forget that map of
yours long enough to win a fight with
your mitts instead of runnin around till
the other guy drops dead declared
purdy with considerable heat

  flash gave his tie a final twist
whistled a bar or two of the latest
broadway success then turned to face
his manager

  aw be yourself bill he smiled
youre all wound up tonight like a
ball of yarn

  who wouldnt be demanded purdy

  listen mister fashion-plate i want
to tell you i had a tough time getting
you on with crane tonight see i had
to promise that youd give em th jdnda
say it with haymakers



scrap they want and what did you do
eh

  you mean you were crazy enough to
promise that id let crane make a
punching bag outa me asked flash
with a lifting of eyebrows

   mean i promised you wouldnt put
 no bicycle act stated purdy angrily

  i didnt i simply proved that science
is better than brute strength declared
flash calmly again turning to the mir-
ror and giving his sleek black hair a final
pat

  and you were th guy that used to
bring the gang up on their feet every
round said purdy sadly with a shake
of his gray head

  that was before i knew any better
smiled flash

  thats before you got a beauty com-
plex snapped purdy

  why should i let anyone scramble
my pan demanded flash

  i didnt say you had to said purdy
but im telling you the managers and
th gangs gettin tired watching you use
the ring for a cinder path and he
added after all its the gang who pays
th shot isnt it

  well i won tonight didnt i and
i made a monkey outa crane whats
the beef demanded flash

  yeah and a monkey outa me to th
promoters railed purdy jab   
jab    jab with your left like youd
forgot to bring your other hand with
you

  which all goes to prove that i can
take fellows like crane with one hand
flash was smiling again

  oh youre good and you know it
sneered purdy

  you know i am nodded flash with
an exasperating grin then before
purdy could frame a retort well bill
old-timer i gotta go down to see my
tailor hes waiting for me going to
get a fitting on my new suit boy you
ought to see it a wow and only a
hundred fish

  aw you and your comical ideas give
me a pain raged purdy i wish some-

body would spoil that mug of yours
with a brick or something and in
his raging disappointment bill purdy
really believed that he meant it

bill purdy propped the seattle
morning post intelligencer against
the sugar bowl dunked a doughnut in
his coffee took a bite then almost
choked as his eyes took in the scream-
ing headlines

  flash odowd near deaths door

  swiftly purdy ran his eye through
the body of the story 

  flash odowd the beau brummel of the
pacific coast prize-ring lies in the emergency
hospital his face liadly mangled

  eye-witnesses say that odowd interfered
when a burly logger apparently under the
influence of liquor maltreated a crippled
newsboy odowd was administering a well-
deserved drubbing when he was attacked by
two of the loggers companions backed off
the curb by the sudden rush of his new op-
ponents odowd stepped into the path of a
speeding sedan   

  then the last paragraph caught pur-
dys eye

  physicians at the hospital fear that odowd
may have suffered a concussion of the brain
they fear that even should the fighter re-
cover he will be disfigured for life   

  there were other details but purdy
raced to his car at the curb ten min-
utes later he presented himself at the
information desk in the emergency
hospital

  no mr odowd had not regained
consciousness sorry but no one was
allowed to see him at present how-
ever if mr purdy would be seated one
of the nurses would give him such par-
ticulars as were available

  bill purdy left the hospital terribly
depressed flash was in a bad way
recalling his last words to flash i
wish somebody would spoil that mug
of yours with a brick or something bill
felt as though he could never forgive
himself

  but gosh i didnt mean it flash-
not really he muttered to himself as
he climbed into his car and drove slowly
away


fight stories

  but flash odowd got better in
this time of need his splendid physique
stood him in good stead beyond a
slight relapse when he first caught sight
of his badly twisted nose and scarred
upper lip he recovered rapidly

  purdy was a constant visitor during
flashs convalescence and when flash
passing a tentative hand across the sur-
geons tape that still adorned his face
remarked that bills wish about his
looks had been granted purdy silently
cursed his temper and tried to explain

  so flash odowd fully recovered
in body even though not in spirit re-
sumed his vocation of fisticuffs

  but he was not the same flash
odowd who had carefully boxed his
way to decisions in those other days
he was now a fighting demon who
feared no mans fists

   his first battle some six months after
the accident was a return bout with
shifty crane over whom he had barely
earned the decision on the evening of
his mishap

  shifty crane received the surprise of
his somewhat lengthy fistic career
flash odowd brought the ring-worms
to their feet within the first minute of
fighting

  at the clang of the gong things began
to happen immediately crane smart-
ing under the sting of his previous de-
feat which he had always credited to
an unfair decision waded right in

  flash wasting no time in preliminary
fiddling weaved in and socked home a
hefty right chop to cranes square chin
to follow through with a left in the short
ribs that did more than tickle

  the fans awoke with a start the
boos that had greeted flash died

  atta old sock flash

  pow who said they never come
back howled another

  shifting his attack flash got in two
more solid smashes without a return

  cream puffs sneered crane as he
buried his chin behind a bulking shoul-
der

  have a chocolate eclair flash in-

vited whipping over a straight left that
slipped past cranes elbow and took him
on the button again

  bill purdy stood peering over the
edge of the ring platform his ruddy
face wreathed in smiles the vision
of managing a world champion welter-
weight was obtruding again

  during the first two rounds crane
also wore a grin for he was quite evi-
dently under the impression that he
could take flashs measure in a slug-
ging bee

  but in the beginning of the third
canto flash caught his adversary with
a whistling right that wiped the grin
off as though by magic the end came
so suddenly a moment later that bill
purdy could scarcely believe his pop-
ping eyes

  a straight left to the face brought
cranes mitts up for the fraction of a
second flashs terrible right took him
under the heart with terrific force then
all in a second flashs left hook took
him flush on the button

  cranes legs folded up the fight
was over the crowd rose as one per-
son yowling approval flash odowd
was again their idol the ringster who
brought them to their feet in a mad
frenzy of excitement

no trouble to secure matches for
flash now and bill purdy was al-
most happy not quite however for
two things bothered him flash since
his recovery constantly railed against
the fate that had marred his once classi-
cal features and purdy found his charge
increasingly difficult to handle with each
successive bout then too when flash
was in one of his frequent moods bill
purdy remembering his angry wish
was filled with self-reproach somehow
or other he could not help feeling as
though he were partly responsible this
he argued to himself was an absurd
feeling but there it was and it
bothered him

  i always said you could take any of
these monkeys if youd only fight was
say it with haymakers



purdys unfortunate beginning as they
entered the dressing-room after flash
had stretched tiger gorman

  yeah grunted flash throwing
himself face down on the rubbing table

  ill bet you ruined tiger for a
month purdy rattled on as uncle joe
the colored trainer began his work oil
the prostrate fighter

  yeah

  evidently flash wasnt communicative
tonight but purdy was enthusiastic

  ill say so and then a moment
later listen flash if you am hang
it on kid peters in frisco next
month us for the east what i mean
   and th title from lennie
sharkey

  yeah

  say whats th matter with you
lately purdy bristled you used to
be a regular guy

  i had a regular face then flash
burst out as he jerked to a sitting pos-
ture now look at it thrusting his
battered features upward so that the
light overhead gave his face a satyr-like
expression what fun do t get outa
life now he demanded savagely tve
got a pan thatd scare a gargoyle off a
roof

  aw gee forget it flash mumbled
purdy taken aback by the very fierce-
ness of the others tone youre not
half as bunged up as some fighters
why-

  dont try to kid me bill rasped
the other i know what i look like
ive got a face like the missing link

  youre the best welter in the game
declared purdy vehemently

  what do i care about the game
raged flash on the instant id gladly
give my chance at the title if i ever
get it if that would bring my face right
again

  and bill purdy being a wise man-
ager let it go at that

  except for such occasional out-
bursts however flash was an ideal
fighter to manage he was a heavy pro-
ducer who never questioned purdys

choice of an opponent so matches
came with steady regularity for there
are many good boys in the welter class

  flash tucked kid peters the pride of
california away in five sizzling rounds
and purdy true to his word bought
tickets for the east purdy was on the
trail of lennie sharkey the title holder

flash made his debut in the big
town by adding another ko after
his record at the expense of sailor
ritski and the sports writers got an
earful from purdy concerning his
proteges future place in the world of
mitts and resin

  other battles followed and it was not
long until the aces -began to ask why
this young fellow with the mashed pan
shouldnt be given a crack at lennie
sharkey

  it began to look as though flasli
odowd would finally punch his way to
a shot at the title

  and if t can just ease him along till
then purdy confided in uncle joe
maybe liell forget that busted map for
a while

  mebbe so boss mebbe so said
uncle joe but at flash is sho nuff
a changed boy sence lie done got
hurted

  so bill purdy tried his best to keep
flash from brooding but it was a
thankless job and purdys patience was
sorely tried

  what do i care what they say about
me flash would say when purdy
would relate a favorable bit of gossip
from one of the gymnasiums and
purdy with a shrug of shoulders would
sigh as he dropped the subject

  then flash took the bowery kid
in four rounds and the sports writers
began an earnest campaign calculated to
stir the champions manager bud
williams into action

  flash theres just one more guy be-
tween us and a shot at the crown said
purdy as he looked over the morning
papers and saw the space given to
flashs latest victory


fight stories

  who asked flash indifferently
ko morgan answered purdy
and he went on hes the boy that
held sharkey to a draw a year or so
ago-sharkeys dodged him ever since
hes one tough slugger

  get him for me said flash evenly
lets see how tough he really is
wow ejaculated purdy boy if
you can take morgan youll sure be
the popular lad

  with who demanded flash
sharply

  why-why with everybody-with
all the gang stammered the little man-
ager somewhat at a loss for words he
had thought that flash was in a
more amiable mood tonight for a
change

  the gang echoed flash scornfully
and whos the gang a bunch whod
frame their own brothers to make a
dime the gang huh guys who sit
and yell kill him-knock him dead
and not one of em could bust an egg
with a sledge hammer most of em
would faint over a cut finger so thats
the mob im popular with eh but out-
side of the ropes im a fighter with a
messed-up pan that scares kids on the
street the gang blah

  just the same theyve been pretty
good to you that same gang flared
purdy unable to hold back his anger at
this unfair indictment they give you
credit for being the gamest scrapper in
the game today theyve always given
you a real reception since youve been
givin em the stuff they pay to see and
i bet if you were on your back tomor-
row without a dime theyd chip in and
give you a benefit

  why cut in the other

  why because they like you thats
why declared purdy with conviction

  youre wrong said flash they
like to see me knock some guy loose i
give em the worth of their admission
fee

  aw right have it your way was
purdys come back thats what all
fighters owe the gang-their moneys

worth isnt it no fighter has to stay
in th game if he dont like it

  for once flash had  further argu-
ment

  let it go at that he said but get
me this ko morgan and well see if
we can give the gang one hundred per-
cent entertainment value for their dol-
lars

the sporting club was packed to
the rafters with the faithful ko
morgan vs flash odowd truly a
spectacle to warm the cockles of any
ring worms heart

  two battlers who would give them a
knock-down-drag-em-out fight that
would keep them on the edge of their
seats until the last downward swing of
the referees arm ko morgan whom
the champion had dodged for months
and flash odowd whose string of
knockouts included some of the hardest
skulls in the business

  the preliminaries had been all that
could be desired and now the immense
crowd yelled for the big thrill of the
evening

  flash entered the ring first amid a
thunder of applause that should have
stirred the heart of a cigar store indian
yet he gave no outward sign that he
heard any of it

  k o morgan on the other hand
grinned all over as he drew his share of
hand-clapping and yells when he
emerged from his quarters a moment or
so later

  they shook hands without wasting
any words and were introduced bill
purdy fussed around like a mother hen
with a day-old brood of chicks over
to the enemy corner for a last examina-
tion of bandages and gloves one never
knew what oft-color trick might be at-
tempted

  the aces studied the fighters with
wise eyes there had been no advance
dope on this go and they were trying
to pick a winner

  ko morgan with a weeks growth
of stiff black beard on his granite-like
say it with haymakers

n

jaws certainly looked every bit as tough
as his news-clippings averred flash
save for his twisted features looked like
a healthily tanned greek god his long
biceps gave little indication of the
tremendous hitting power they held
nor did his deltoids betray the terrific
driving force hidden in their snaky
ripples

  both fighters betrayed signs of ner-
vousness while various challengers
climbed through the ropes to the an-
nouncers loud introductions old stuff
and they were on edge ready to go

  then the referee beckoned them to
the center for final instructions more
old stuff

  the hot spluttering arcs above threw
their magnificent bodies into sharp re-
lief emphasizing the fact that morgan
was stockier than flash too his
abnormally long arms somehow gave
him an ape-like appearance

  flash devoid of hair on his chest
looked as supple as a jungle cat and
the regulars having witnessed his man-
killing right in action knew that mor-
gan tough as he might be had picked
a tartar this time

  a breathless hush of expectancy as
the referee with a curt   shake
hands and come out fightin patted
them each on a shoulder as they took
their comers

  now a jerking back of stools and a
hurried scrambling of handlers as the
ten second whistle shrilled    last
liaorse whispers of advice from both
corners  a nervous clearing of throats
from the audience    the sudden dark-
ness leaving the ring and its three oc-
cupants framed in a brilliant square   
two men whose hearts beat rapidly in
spite of their professional nonchalance
 then  a brazen clang f

the spectators drew sharp breaths
between set teeth as the two men
slid from their corners wary ready for
anything

  sure-footed hands and feet syn-
chronized perfectly flash moved with-

out effort morgan with the trained
shuffle of the heavy hitter moved to
meet him hands weaving to and fro a
contemptuous sneer lifting one corner
of his thin lips

  within distance flash abruptly
swerved to the left at the same time
whipping over his right with a swish
speedy as the punch was morgan
weaved away taking the blow on his
arm as he countered with a stiff left

  take him flash    come on
ko    sock him irish the
leather-lunged rooters were opening up

  just back of flashs corner his face
alight with supressed emotion bill
purdy peered upward at the battlers
this morgan was one hard boy and
purdy realized fully that the result of
tonights fight would in all probability
settle once and for all whether or not he
would ever manage a worlds champion
for it was generally conceded that the
winner of this battle would quite likely
beat lennie sharkey

  the first more or less nervous ex-
change over both men settled down to
business both knew full well that this
would be no one-punch affair it would
be a man-killing battle punctuated by
many agonizing seconds when the ring
career of one or the other would hang
precariously in the balance

  no wasted efforts spent in grand-
stand plays here every punch was a
premeditated menace

  for three action-packed rounds both
sought by means of every legitimate
trick of the game to put over the wallop
that would mean the beginning of the
long count

  then in the fourth morgan clipped
flash solidly on the jaw as the latter
weaved in too high for serious
damage flash had ducked but the
punch still had considerable steam be-
hind it flash was swung a little off
balance

  before he could recover morgans
right caught him just under the breast-
bone that one did hurt and for the
first time during the fight flash went


fight stories

under wraps the fans jumped up and
howled madly

  at the hell ko morgan went to his
corner with a decided swagger at
last he had forced this fighting fool
into his shell

  hurt y questioned bill purdy
anxiously as odowd stretched himself
back on the stool arms flung wide over
the second rope

  darn right

  serious pursued purdy

  caught me in the wind and dug his
elbow in my belly gritted flash then
a second later after uncle joe had
wiped his face with the squeezed sponge
ill make him pay for that one

  keep your noodle advised purdy
thats his old game gets em all
steamed-up    an takes em

  he wont take me flash growled
easy on them ribs joe

  before the sound of the gong calling
them for the fifth had died morgan
left his corner with a cyclonic rush
plainly calculating to catch his opponent
unprepared ko was out to finish the
job so well started in the previous canto

  even as he started over the canvas
flash sensed the situation perfectly and
acted accordingly like a graven image
he stood motionless until morgan
weaved into position for a right
swing

  then like a streak flashs rapier-
like left shot out wickedly beaten to
the punch by the perfectly-timed blow
calculated to throw him oft his stride
morgan took flashs countering right
under the heart and plopped to a sitting
posture on the canvas for the first knock-
down of the bout

  and the ring-worms exercised their
lungs

   ilis pride hurt rather than his body
morgan bounded back to the attack be-
fore the referee had time to start a
count

  wow  yelled a fan set em up in
the other alley

  for a few seconds morgans temper
got the better of his judgment and he

tore into the grinning flash swinging
like a gate in the wind but another
solid smash under the ticker cooled him
considerably

  easy boy    easy boy came
from morgans corner

  at-a-boy flash    you cn do
it roared purdy

  the fifth ended with both fighters
socking ding-dong hammer-and-tongs
in the middle of the ring with the crowd
screaching for the knockout

  hes weakenin was purdys greet-
ing as flash took his stool watch
him close he always tries to dish th
dirt when th goin gets too tough

   flash lay back breathing deeply with-
out answering

  clang

now it was flash who left his cor-
ner like a thunderbolt

  morgan was not prepared for this
before he could slip out of the trap
flash nailed him on the ropes with his
dynamic left and right

  flung against the tautened hemp
morgan rebounded under partial cover
only to take flashs right mauler under
the heart again pie doubled over in
agony and a great billow of sound came
from beyond the shadows

  flash drew back to put over the
sleeper but even as he swung k o
went to the canvas on one knee

  too late to pull the punch entirely
flash stumbled awkwardly in his effort
to avoid a foul

  in a trice k o saw his chance all
in one movement he shot to his feet
and his right mitt flashed in a looping
arc that started from his heels

  the cowardly blow took flash with a
loud-sock-flush on the button

   dazed flash rocked back on his heels
instantly morgan was on top of him
throwing leather with both hands a
terrific uppercut caught flash in the
stomach doubling him over

   morgans eyes glinted with the killer-
light as he hastily measured his man
and swung again but for his haste the
say it with haymakers



fight might well have ended then and
there as it was the punch landed high
 flashs jaw yet every ounce of
power in morgans one hundred forty-
five pounds was behind that leather-
covered fist and flash hit the canvas
his head spinning like a top

  purdys yell take a niner   
take a niner   came to him in a
dull whisper    his head felt
strangely light    there was a jan-
gling as of bells rung too close in his
ears    all around him a confused
jumble of meaningless noises punc-
tuated by shrill yelps    his
limbs refused to move    then
suddenly he made out the referees
   seven    eight   
he shook his head savagely and the
ring stood still again    the danc-
ing mists cleared and he saw morgan
over in a neutral corner tensed for the
kill

  at nine he weaved to unsteady legs
to meet morgans head-long pounce
and again morgans hurried eagerness
was a life-saver to flash

  despite his still somewhat benumbed
faculties flash retained enough fight-
ing instinct to step inside morgans
vicious swing and clinch before mor-
gan could shake himself free the gong
ended the round

  lying back in his corner gulping huge
lungfuls of life-giving air flash neard
the crowd roar its contempt of mor-
gans unfairness somehow he felt a
sudden glow of satisfaction

  throw th rat out    morgan
youre a dirty   and other frag-
ments of choice expressions

  boy theyre for you no foolin
beamed purdy and a strange deter-
mination to win at any cost sent new
strength surging through flashs tired
muscles

  no use trying to play fair with a
rat like that gritted purdy as lie jerked
the stool aside take him when you
get a chance

  ill take him said flash quietly
but ill take him fair

the minute respite had worked
wonders for flash and both bat-
tiers surged to the center of the ring-
ready

  there was a flurry of short but deadly
punches given and absorbed then
morgan ducking a wicked right chop
clinched and rammed his stubble-
covered chin in flashs right eye rak-
ing downward cruelly as he brought
his left elbow low to his adversarys
stomach

  you dirty dog snarled flash tear-
ing free and lacing over a right and
left you dont know what fairness
means

  blocking both punches craftily mor-
gan grinned and slid into another clinch

  did i hurt th pretty boy gee if
i had a map like yours id fight bull-
dogs

  unwittingly morgan had pierced
flashs weakness with a savage oath
he heaved free and flailed away at mor-
gan as though demented his one de-
sire was to maim the sneering face that
mocked him to heck with science

  morgan sensing that he had pulled an
exceptionally good goat-getter covered
up before flashs wild attack waiting
his chance

  rage-blinded flash was all over his
opponent like a swarm of bees coolly
morgans keen eyes weighed every pos-
sible opening and here was one made
to order

  stepping inside a left swing that left
flashs entire side open morgan un-
corked his devastating slumber-powder

  whom the right-handed punch
caught flash fair in the solar plexus
a left to the chin and then another
right

  smash that one was fair  flashs
twisted nose

  both battlers were splattered red

  bill purdy danced up and down as
though hung on wires what was th
matter with flash must have gone
goofy    up rose the blood-lust-
ing fans yelling unheeded advice to both
principals


fight stories

  with a shake of his head that
covered his features with a mask of
blood flash weaved in without pause
his face felt as though covered with a
leaden mask    nose must be
smashed to a pulp again ran his
thoughts    but the bell found him
boring-boring in 

  what th    began purdy as
he helped flash to his stool

  shut up snapped flash get busy
   blood    choking me   
cant breathe

  frantically uncle joe worked with
cold packs  the back of flashs neck
and wads of paper under his upper lip
gradually the stream was checked

  once more came the relentless call
of the bell

morgan shot across the ring like
an arrow out for the kill this
time without mistake

  hes all in take him had been
his orders

  swings and right crosses uppercuts
and jabs morgan tried them all within
the next few seconds yet time after
time the man with the grotesque red
curtain over his face evaded his choicest
offerings cunning elbows were al-
ways in the way

  flash had himself in hand again a
cold killing rage flooded his very soul
each time that morgan led flash stab-
bed back with a deadly left that always
landed true a left that kept morgans
closc-cropped head snapping backward
with monotonous regularity

  the ring fans sensing that flash was
far from through again took up their
chant of encouragement

  a dozen stiff jabs slowed morgan
down somewhat too the coolness of
this man who evidently did not know
when he was whipped began to un-
balance morgans sense of distance he
missed continually his anger becoming
more evident with every frustrated at-
tempt

  feinting his man into a corner flash
suddenly switched his attack pulling

a straight left he brought his batter-
ing right over in a stiff-armed cross that
took morgan in the middle

  take him flash from a ringsider
sent a fresh surge of elation through
him that in some inexplicable manner
seemed to make it all worth while

  tear his dome off came a roar as
morgans knees wobbled

  slithering back into perfect hitting
position flash measured the distance
accurately and brought his famous one-
two punch into action

  a left to the button opened morgan
like a book then a breath-stopping right
just under the heart k o morgan
went down like a collapsed wall

  pandemonium a hoarse babel of
discords flash slid into a neutral cor-
ner and the referees arm began ticking
away a fighters chances for future fame
and fortune

  gloves hooked over the ropes flasli
stood with heaving chest eyes glued 
the sprawled form at his feet the
swelling roars of the crowd thrilled him
to the core in this moment of hard
squarely fought victory

      eight    nine   
ten    and out

  even as the referee strode over and
raised flashs right arm bill purdy
and uncle joe tumbled through the
ropes toward him

  a doc nose all busted like a drop-
ped egg gasped flash as the blood
streaming down his throat made him
cough

again flash odowd lay  a
white cot in a hospital his face
swathed in temporary bandages his
nose was fractured in three places the
famous surgeon hastily summoned
shook his head

  money is  object bill purdy
said i want the best remodeling job
you can turn out

  so the surgeon with a     most
difficult case    said he would do
his best guaranteeing nothing which is
a way men of science have
say it with haymakers



  flash odowd sat sunning himself
on the balcony of the famous surgeons
hospital today after two months and
many operations flash would know
whether the bone grafting experiment
had succeeded-or whether-but he
would not let his mind dwell on the other
alternative

  howdy flash greeted bill purdy
cheerfully hows th new smeller
cornin

  feel like a million bill returned
the other then after a moment
about the new smeller-well todays
the day they take this stuff off with a
motion of his hand toward the adhesive
tape that still adorned his face

  gee he said earnestly if tve
only got a nose like a human being
again  

  aw flash old kid said purdy
somewhat throatily dont get all
worked up gee theyve done th best
they could but    well maybe it isnt
in th book see  

  mr odowd interrupted a white-
gowned nurse at this moment doctor
melville would like to see you if you
please

  good luck flash murmured
purdy as his protege followed the nurse
inside

  five minutes seemed like an hour to
bill purdy as he paced the floor   
ten minutes purdy looked at his
watch fifteen minutes hurrying
footsteps and flash stood before him

  purdy blinked unbelievingly and sank
into a wicker chair

  bill bill they did it flash
shouted joyfully they built me a
brand new smeller bill look

  flash its a swell job said bill
purdy after he had examined the
newly built organ at close range they
sure nuff made a reglar fix all round

  both men shifted their feet uneasily
and fell silent staring at each other

  it was purdy who finally broached
the vital subject that now confronted
them

  well flash old kid he began

   fight-sept-

after he had cleared his throat whats
th good news 

  bill i dont know said the other
quietly the doc told me that maybe it
would stand the gaff-and maybe it
wouldnt

  another silence

  well said purdy at length youre
th one to say what am i goin to tell
sharkeys manager you know ive
told you the line of bull hes been shoot-
in ever since you took morgan says
youll be afraid to put on the mitts and
all that stuff

  purdy paused and fortified himself
with a man-sized chew of coal black
tobacco

  well he intoned at last

  bill i dont know answered flash
honestly

  bill purdy drew a deep breath and
squared his shoulders this was the
situation he had forseen weeks ago he
had sized it up from every possible
angle seeking the right solution now
it was time to play his ace in the hole
if he was correct in his belief that
flash odowds pride was even deeper
than his vanity-well   

  you know he said meeting flashs
gaze squarely i kinda figured if th
sawbones made a first class fix youd
be leary bout riskin another bust so

i	been sorta stalling the news hounds
and the gang off

  gee flash that bunch a sports you
know the gang that calls themselves th
aces club the fellers you got all the
flowers shaped into a horseshoe from
flash nodded slowly that horse-
shoe wreath sure must have set the aces
back a hundred fish or so    nice
kind thought that   

ell theyre sure going to be
disappointed flash gosh they
sure planned to give you one swell send-
off when you stepped in the ring with
the champ purdy paused and sighed
deeply a flush slowly mounted flashs
cheeks but purdy went on remorse-
lessly


fight stories

  i sure hate to spring th bad news on
em    gee what a razzin ill get from
cole and sharkey he said to me only
yesterday its a lucky break for that
palooka that ko put m in the hos-
pital id a done a real job and
then he went on shootin off his mouth
that he could beat you to a froth even
if he let you wear a baseball mask to
protect your new smeller

  purdy with a fierce satisfaction
noted the glint that crept into flashs
eyes as well as the little ridges of rip-
pling muscle along the lean determined
jaws

  made me so mad i bet a grand you
could take sharkey in six rounds   
jumpin catfish flash i sure hate   
well    the shrewd old fellow
paused again flashs features were
set and hard well-theres sure gonna
ibe a lotta blue guys in town when they
get an earful    might as well go and
get it over with he ended with a dole-
ful shake of his gray head as he turned
away

  a tough hand shot out whirling him
around

  listen rasped flash through
clamped teeth get this cheese champ
for me no palooka can get away with
those cracks the doc tells me to give
this smeller three more months then
im ready to give sharkey his chance to
say it with gloves

  mean it boomed purdy pop-eyed
hand outstretched

  you know i do answered flash
with a bone-wrenching shake

  see you later purdy called over
his shoulder im on my way

  but flash odowd did not hear him
already he could hear the roar of wel-
come from the gang    regular fel-
lows all sure was a kind thought those
flowers    his fingers strayed into
his upper vest pocket and brought out
the card that had come with the remem-
brance

  to the gamest of em all-good luck
from the gang  he read aloud cant
lay down on a bunch of real sports like
those fellows    hed show sharkey
who needed the baseball mask huh 
a wave of battle-lust swept through his
veins like fire

  and later one hundred and fifty-
four bucks mused bill purdy as he
scanned the florists statement just re-
ceived that morning

  not a bad idea suggestin to th ace
club that they slip their card in the
bouquet he thought    it sure pays
to say it with flowers he chuckled
aloud as he scratched his wandering
signature across the bottom of a per-
sonal check

 the vision of managing a world
champion welterweight was very clear to
bill purdy at that moment

tommy ryan-financier

an old-timer in the fight game who has proved his financial shrewdness
by cleaning- up a fortune in business is tommy ryan once middleweight

with thrills after journeying about the country for years meeting with
numerous ups and downs ryan wound up in los angeles something more

burns and johnson

by old timer

johnson had followed burns and his title around the world he had begged
for a chance to fight and now it had come    go back to  transport
yourself to sydney australia in a ringside seat beside old timer and
watch that desperate fight unroll  

hristmas day in sydney
christmas day 

  a bright sun shone from a
cloudless sky the city was fight mad
jack johnson and tommy burns were
to meet for the heavyweight champion-
ship of the world at the rushcutters
bay stadium that very morning a
giant black man and a stocky agile
white one fistic history would be
made it was the first time australia
had staged such a spectacle and aus-
tralia has never had one like it since
that time

  all the previous afternoon trains and
carriages had poured visitors into syd-
ney the hotels and boarding houses
were crammed still they came there
was no talk other than fight talk early

christmas morning the streets were
crowdcd

  betting what are the odds tom-
my was a -to- favorite from the day
the match was made but there were few
who took the negros end at those fig-
ures those who like to plnv the short
end waited bit by bit the odds in-
creased there was a vast amount of
burns money on hand when it could
not be placcd at -to- the bettors of-
fered -to-l then the johnson fol-
lowers came out of hiding and laid
their money on the line oh yes there
was betting enough

  ithe air was full of the usual rumors
it was known there was bad blood be-
tween the contiestants now it was
reported that their seconds were keeping




fight stories

them hidden ftfr fear they might meet
and have a street brawl bunk pure
ballyhoo but it stirred up a vast amount
of interest there was the usual yarn
to the effect that the fight had been
fixed it was said that it would be a
draw so they could meet again in the
states for a bigger purse mcintosh
the promoter an honest and respected
man insisted that everything was on
the level the whispers continued
they might put something over on mac
you know

  it wasnt long after sunrise that the
early starters began drifting to the sta-
dium they were the incurably curious
they wanted to see everything that hap-
pened even the inconsequential little
details of fixing the ring soon the
dribble became a stream then a flood
then a rushing torrent carriages
wagons automobiles thousands of
people on foot

  the stadium was considered a vast
structure in those days for it seated
 people with room for 
standees every indication pointed to
an overcrowded house those who had
failed to get tickets became panic-
stricken as high as a hundred dollars
apiece were offered for ringside seats

  as the hours passed the stadium be-
came jammed and bulging with human-
ity the sun crept higher in the sky
the fight was scheduled for eleven
oclock long before that time you
couldnt have squeezed a sardine into
the closely packed confines of the arena

  shortly before that hour the warriors
appeared accompanied by a perfect
bedlam of cheers the ebony-skinned
giant towered more than six inches
above the man who was recognized as
champion burns was no more than a
light-heavy weight though that pound-
age packed on a frame that measured
no more than five feet seven and a half
inches made him look squatty and thick

  in one way though burns was a
freak that was in the matter of reach
in spite of his lack of height his reach
measured  inches more than his

big rivals it was this length of arm
that enabled him to whip so many big-
ger rivals

  mcintosh decided to referee the fight
himself he was not only the best
referee in australia but had vitally at
heart the task of seeing that this bout
was really  the level to his knowl-
edge the men intended doing their best
but he wanted to be in supreme com-
mand to act if he saw anything sus-
picious

  he called the rivals to the center of
the ring johnson towered high above
the white man he smiled showing his
flashing gold teeth it was the smile
of a good-natured boy jack had many
faults he was wild and irresponsible
but was a friendly fellow who wanted
people to like him burns on the other
hand was grim and scornful he acted
as though johnson was an inter-
loper a fool who was going to take a
good trouncing for daring to challenge
him

  the champion was seconded by keat-
ing okeefe odonnell burke and
russell johnson was accompanied by
sam fitzpatrick rudy ltnholz the
boer lightweight bryant mullins and
bill lang an erstwhile australian op-
ponent mcintosh announced that if
the police should stop the bout he would
award the decision to the man in the
lead at that time this met with every-
ones approval photographs were taken
and the bell rang

both men were cautious at the start
they fiddled around sparring for
an opening each had a deep respect
for the other even if lie hadnt admitted
it and was not inclined to take chances

  then thosewho had bet -to-l 
gallant tommy were given a terrific
shock johnson landed a sharp right
uppercut that landed under the cana-
dians chin down went tommy he
was shaken though not vitally hurt
but the psychology of the thing was
now all with the black man he had
shown burns that he could hit he had
famous fights i have seen



shown even more clearly that he was
not afraid

 tom stayed down for a count of
eight his head was clear and he nodded
reassuringly toward his seconds but a
knockdown is a knockdown and he de-
termined to take advantage of all the
time possible ite sprang suddenly to
his feet and charged at johnson swing-
ing at the body

  jack blocked his lead and countered
with a smashing right that sent tommy
staggering across the ring the cana-
dian though was tough and game he
pulled himself together and came back
like a wildcat landing a stiff right to
his enemys jaw and smothering the big
fellows attempted returns but john-
son hooked in a powerful left just be-
fore the bell sounded for the end
of the round and burns went back to
his corner with a serious look on his big
face

  there was every reason for him to
be serious johnson had shown him-
self an excellent boxer and a sharp
hitter toms ears still rang with the
rattle of blows on his chin but he
wasnt discouraged he told himself
that he would soon get to johnsons
body the texas negro would curl up
if he was battered there sure hed
curl all these fellows did they
couldnt take it in the body

  johnson rose from his stool a second
before the bell sounded he waved his
gloves with a wide smile and shouted
come on tommy

 burns needed no invitation he
charged across the ring and was met
with a left hook that swept his feet
out from under him down he went
but leaped up immediately he tried
to get into the stomach but jack beat
him to it burying his left fist wrist
deep in the canadians body he fol-
lowed up his advantage landing with
both hands to the face toms left eye
began to swell and turn an ugly bluish
color tie tried hard but couldnt get
past the black mans superb defense
johnson showed that he was stronger

too by handling burns with ease in the
clinches

  this was bad the champions sec-
onds gabbled excitcdly but tommy
paid no attention to them he sat
quietly waiting through the rest period
still high-hearted still certain that he
could get past those guarding arms ite
had to get past them if he didnt the
championship would be gone hed be
licked by the big fellow who had chased
him clear across the world begging for
a chance to fight

  burns tore into johnson with every-
thing he had in the third round after
landing a sharp right to the head he
ripped jacks body with both hands
the texan was borne back by the fury
of the assault for a time he couldnt
block those fists that rattled off his
middle the only execution he did was
by landing some frightful blows over the
kidneys when they clinched these hurt
but tommy was so elated at his success
in taking the fight into the johnson
camp that he didnt mind them he
was winning from now on it would be
his fight why the big stiff might be
as tall as the woolworth building it
didnt matter hed get him anyway

  but jack seemed untroubled when
the next round started he lashed a
heavy right-hander to tommys heart
and the canadian retaliated with an-
other they began making remarks to
each other bitter sarcastic things they
sneered at color religion and courage
they were each intent on getting the
other excited as they talked they
fought their way in and out of clinches
but did no appreciable damage they
looked queer in the clinches with the
giant colored man towering so high
above burns

  to the casual onlooker who might have
just wandered in without a knowledge
of either mans capabilities this must
have seemed a most uneven battle but
it wasnt uneven freshened by his
minutes rest burns flared out to pepper
johnson with both fists in the fifth and
win that round with plenty to spare


fight stories

johnson though was as coolly
confident as ever he seemed to
feel that he had the canadian at his
mercy that it was in the books for
him to win though he didnt have
much of a lead up to this point he had
sampled the best punches tommy had
in his repertoire and had not been hurt
or bothered by them so in the sixth
he took the aggressive himself

  he went after burns and tommy
hustled himself into a clinch holding
with his left jack burned his right fist
into his opponents side a dozen times
those blows hurt they would drain
anyones stamina burns realizing that
he wasnt strong enough to cope with
johnson in the clinches broke loose
and let go a rapid-fire of blows to the
body johnson laughed at them

  that all the harder yon cn punch
little man he jibed huh somcbuddy
tole me you was a hitter mustve been
somebuddy else he meant yo cant hit
a-tall

  with that he bustled tommy across
the ring driving rights and lefts to the
stomach so fast that burns simply had
to cover up and run he couldnt get
started against that whirlwind

  at that point the champion began to
lose some of his high confidence it
wasnt a lack of courage on his part
he had never quit in his life and he
was not going to quit now but he
realized the tremendous handicap he was
facing if johnson merely had size it
wouldnt matter so much but backing
up his much greater strength was won-
derful boxing skill and accurate hitting
the man was a real fighter it would
be a tough job to beat him

  if the sixth round had been bad for
burns the seventh was worse john-
son had the smell of victory in his nose
 fe wanted to win as quickly as possible

  the big man didnt box in that sev-
enth round he fought lie pounded
and tore tommy with both hands
burns kept his head he was cool and
knew exactly what he should do if his
physical limitations permitted once

in the midst of a fierce attack he sent
johnson back on his heels with a hard
left hook but there were lumps under
both eyes now and he was tiring

  the discolored orbs were targets in-
viting marks for johnson to shoot at
he landed repeatedly and talked to the
people at the ringside about how easy
he found it to whip his opponent burns
didnt lose his head even then tie kept
shooting at the shiny black body before
him but johnson as though to show
his versatility switched from the head
and knocked tommy down with a
vicious hook to the ribs the champion
came up quickly mad as a dripping
cat but the knockdown counted against
him

  he came up for the eighth eyes
puffed and with a drip of blood on his
lips an intolerable weariness had set-
tled on him there was no longer any
sting in his punches several times
almost disdainfully johnson allowed
openings but burns couldnt take ad-
vantage of them in the meantime the
big stevedore was hacking and lashing
at tommys head adding further to the
damage lie had done even burns must
have known that only a miracle could
save him it looked as though johnson
might score a knockout at any moment
but those who expected it did not count
on the canadians courage and great
stamina

  jack taunted tom writh the ineffec-
tiveness of his blows

  swing your right tommy he
sneered swing it

  you yellow dog burns snarled
rushing into action he was burning
with rage it didnt matter what hap-
pened to him now there was only one
thing in the world that was worth doing
-that wotdd bring him joy and con-
tentment-and that was to bash and
bruise the man opposite lie couldnt
achieve that desire he found the range
too great

  the tenth was slow johnson tired
from his tremendous exertions burns
from the punishment he had absorbed
famous fights i have seen



they stalled each trying to regain his
strength

in the next though the punishment
began afresh jack his body wet
with sweat that made it gleam like pol-
ished walnut used his fists effectively
against toms head and body the
latter fought back gamely he gave
everything he had but seemed singularly
ineffective he was outclassed he
knew it johnson was invulnerable at
the end of the round tom limped back
to his distressed seconds a battered
weary man on the edge of disastrous
defeat

  the twelfth coming up the twelfth
coming and again the little canadian
was subjected to a frightful battering
his eyes were almost closed his jaw
was swollen to almost twice its normal
size the fight having been well and
gamely fought so far now degenerated
into a test between johnsons hitting
power and burns failing stamina

  tommy was dazed he hardjy knew
where he was or what he was doing
only the instinct of a game man to
keep on his feet kept him moving for-
ard always forward into the swirl of
the merciless johnson fists mercy had
no place in that ring the champion-
ship was at stake and then there was
the implacable feud between these two
burns had lashed him with stinging
words why shouldnt he be paid back
with blows

  johnson continued to play for the
swollen eyes and bleeding mouth with
his accurate blows he hit and hit and
hit at the disfigured face he put
everything he had into those punches
but burns refused to go down he
staggered about blind to everything a
wavering reed in a gale but was still
on his feet enduring the battering when
the harsh-throated bell saved him for
the moment

  that skimpy rest period could do
him no good he was done for his
championship was gone there was no
longer even the chance of a lucky blow

  for tommy hadnt the strength to de-
liver it his seconds soaked him with
water and jammed smelling salts under
his nose burns shook his head
to clear it a little more he had just
enough vitality left to get him to his
feet and out to the center of the ring
for the fourteenth round

  johnson feinted and then let the
right go it landed flush on the jaw
darkness descended over toms brain
down he fell through the pitch black
void down-down-until he felt the
scratch of the resin under his knees
and heard hugh mcintoshs voice beat-
ing against his ears

   	 f i ve-s i x-sevc n-e i ght- 

  he rose not knowing how or why
johnson was at him instantly with a
tigerish ferocity smashing away with
both hands expending all his dislike
of this man with his blows game
tommy staggered toms red and
blinded face was toward his foe but
he could do nothing to protect him-
self

  mcintosh might have stopped the
fight then under ordinary circum-
stances he would have done so but this
was a championship ibout and tradition
demanded that when a champion fin-
ishes he must finish on his back ttis
seconds knowing toms courage would
not throw in the towel theyd let him
take it because he wanted no interven-
tion so the referee held his hand too
hoping that johnson would do the job
quickly it didnt look as though there
would be much difficulty about that

  there was a commotion at the ring-
side a police inspector and half a
dozen men jumped into the ring the
fight was over

  mcintosh instantly seized johnsons
wet and bloody glove and lifted his
right hand high in the air a new
champion had been crowned

this was a battle that deserved to
be rated among the great ones it
is true that johnson outclassed burns
after the first six rounds that he was


fight stories

so clever and shifty that tommy was
seldom able to rcach a vital spot it
was true that johnson jolted and jarred
the white man continually that he
proved himself a greater defensive
boxer a harder hitter and a better ring
general than the canadian

  but dont forget that tommy burns
faced a handicap of six inches in
heighth and almost twenty pounds in
weight that seldom in any champion-
ship affair has there been such a vast
difference in physical prowess tom
has never been rated as highly as he
should have been because of this dis-
astrous bout at rushcutters bay how
many light-heavyweights-and that is
all lie was-could have compiled as fine
a record as he did and could have gone
fourteen fast rounds with the jack
johnson of that day

  johnson really had everything all
the veterans concede that he rated with
the greatest heavyweights of all time
that burns fought him as he did is
indicative that he had some elements of
fistic greatness himself looking back
it is incredible that tom should have
been rated a favorite but johnsons
record for this reason or that had not
been so impressive up to then

  burns was born noah brusso in han-
over canada the dominion to the
north has produced great soldiers-as
the princess pat and other regiments
proved in the world war-but very
few good heavyweight fighters there
were jack munroe and victor mclag-
len and jack renault and others of that
stripe and pattern but they never went
very far with their fists burns was
the pick of the lot

  it may be that he doesnt deserve to
rank with fitzsimmons corbett and
jeffries he lacked the physical quali-
fications of those champions but he
was as brave and smart as any one of
thorn a good boxer and a sharp hitter
tie was rightfully the champion of his
day-in the hiatus between jeffries and
johnson-and there was no reason why
there should have been any question

about inscribing his name on the mul-

doon trophy

  twenty-one years elapsed between
his start and finish as a fighting man
he numbered jim flynn philadelphia
jack obrien marvin hart bill squires
and others among his victims that he
could hit is proven by his record of
thirty-four knockouts in fifty-seven
fights they didnt feed him pushovers
either ite had to fight for everything
he got

  the tommy burns you see around
nowadays-a fat powerful man-car-
ries no hint of the little fighting fury
of twenty years ago ite could fight
too not that he was ever as good as
the man who crushed him at rushcut-
ters bay he wasnt at his very best
he never compared with the big lazy
gold-toothed stevedore from galveston
johnson had everything if he had bal-
anced his grand fighting ability with
sense enough to keep out of trouble he
would have been admittedly one of
the great heroes of the ring-just as
was that other colored man peter jack-
son

  but that is neither here nor there
he beat burns fairly he not only
beat him he ruined him tommy
fought only six times in the next twelve
years even though he won all these
bouts except his last one with joe
beckett they just didnt mean anything
tom was done and he knew it

  burns started boxing in port huron
he was a clean cut youngster who
never smoked or drank and was always
in condition but there were few
chances for advancement he cam-
paigned around michigan for twenty-
five and fifty-dollar purses without get-
ting anywhere

  a promoter dropped into port huron
one day with the idea of building an
indoor skating rink he became in-
volved in an argument in the hotel
lobby with a stranger concerning the
number of rounds which nonpareil
jack dempsey and dominick mccaf-
frey had fought a bet was the in-
famous fights i have seen



evitable result and the men repaired to
the house of an old sporting character
who kept all the record books he could
lay his hands on having the bet de-
cided in his favor the promoter re-
mained to talk

the old-timer began talking of
tommy burns a grand boy he
said and some time hell be a fine
fighter why dont you pick him up
you might make some money for
yourself

  the upshot of it was that tommy
was called in he was quiet and self-
contained he didnt boast of his abil-
ity though he did say that he was aching
for a real chance

  id like to see you work said the
promoter a real fight i mean not a
gymnasium workout whats the chance
o that

  well said tommy theres an
englishman in this town who used to
be a fighter i guess hes forty years
old but he thinks he can lick me al-
ways anxious to get in a scrap he is
if there was any money in it he would
be tickled stiff

  the promoter dccided that here was
a chance not only to see what the boy
bad but to make a little money for
himself he rented a dance hall printed
two hundred tickets that -he sold for
three dollars apiece offered burns and
the cockney fifty dollars and hired a
couple of preliminary bouts for ten
dollars cach the hall was packed for
port huron didnt have much in the
way of fistic entertainment

  the first -bout was between a couple
of colored men with a grudge against
cach other when they started to bite
like a couple of bulldogs it had to be
called off next were two truck drivers
who were bigger than ed dunkhorst
for three or four rounds they panted
and puffed and hit at each other when
they started to kick they were ordered
out of the ring an hour later they
were still fighting each other in the rag-
ing snow storm outside the hall

  then tommy burns and the english-
man entered the ring

  take it easy with the old bozo the
promoter whispered give the folks a
run for their money and let me have a
slant at how you work

  burns agreed tte stripped beauti-
fully being in excellent condition for
four rounds he simply toyed with his
opponent and didnt ladle out any pun-
ishment himself naturally he became
careless that was what the cockney
was waiting for he landed a right-
hander flush on the chin with everything
he had if the man had been ten years
younger burns would have been
knocked out then and there

  an indescribable change came over
tommy he turned to cold fury
there was a terrible viciousness about
him with two minutes of the round
still to go he went to work on the
cockney pie worked so well that after
a minute the promoter jumped into the
ring and led the bleeding stricken en-
glishman back to his corner

  will i do asked tommy

  do said the promoter boy
youll be a champion some day

  he really believed it and intended
managing the boy but becoming en-
tangled in the details of his skating
rink passed it up in later years he
moaned over his lost chance but that
didnt do him any good

  anyway toms meeting with the big-
shot and his fight with the cockney
seemed to inspire him tte went further
afield and began winning steadily
after a few years he assumed a leading
role among the heavyweights

  conditions among the big fellows
were in a rather chaotic state jeffries
on retiring presented his crown to the
winner of the bout between marvin ttart
and jack root-t tart a big clever ken-
tuckian stopping root in twelve rounds
burns beat ttart who had already out-
pointed jack johnson and claimed the
championship he beat philadelphia
jack obrien and other stars to cement
his claim


fight stories

johnson was coming along too
the huge negro whipped joe jean-
nette sandy ferguson jim flynn bob
fitzsimmons and others he went to
australia and knocked out peter felix
and bill lang who had been regarded
as great fellows iby the natives of pago
pago iiobartstown and ballard he
whipped them more decisively than
burns had done

  all this time he continued to hurl
challenges at tommy and tom turned
a deaf ear to them it wasnt that the
sturdy little canadian feared jack he
knew that johnson was a better man
than any he had fought but was quite
confident he could whip him however
while he was making money with easier
marks his reluctance drummed up pub-
lic interest in a bout that was inevitable

  tommy went off to england john-
son didnt have a dollar ibut his man-
ager sam fitzpatrick borrowed enough
from friends to take them to london
still burns wouldnt listen he hastened
to france and then to australia where
he triumphed over the already beaten
squires and lang in the eyes of the
aussies tom was a hero and the great-
est fighter in the world

  meanwhile in england johnson had
whipped a mcnamara and ben
taylor but there was little money and
less renown in that fitzpatrick inter-
ested members of the national sporting
club in the big fellow and they gave
him the money required to get to
australia assistance was rendered
when johnson agreed to come back to
london and fight sam langford re-
gardless of the result of the match with
burns this promise incidently was
never kept

  when johnson and fitzpatrick ar-
rived in sydney they found that tommy
still had the upper hand he was the
champion and the big galveston black
was only a rather despised challenger
the newcomer was informed that if he
wanted a fight he would have to accept
toms terms this wasnt news in any

sense of the word it was expected that
the champion would get the lions share
of the purse champions always did

  hugh mcintosh who promoted bouts
at the rushcutters bay stadium offered
a purse of  sounds laughable
doesnt it in these days of high finance
but it was real money then and the
principals were agreeable burns how-
ever demanded  for his end
win lose or draw that was drawing
it a bit fine after paying their debts
and expenses there wouldnt be much
left

  johnson didnt care he was so con-
fident he could whip the little canadian
that he would have agreed to an even
smaller reward after all the immedi-
ate results of a championship were
small compared with what came later

  tommy was a psychologist he be-
lieved that jack suffered under an in-
feriority complex he continually
harped on his ability to whip the big
man he claimed that johnson was yel-
low and had shown a lack of courage on
more than one occasion he was so
brash and sure that much of the -to-l
odds quoted in burns favor was due
to these verbal assaults

  the quiet boy of port huron had
changed somewhat this was natural
burns was smart quick to take advan-
tage of an opening he knew as well
as anyone that johnson had a world of
ability and all the physical advantages
those advantages must be minimized
by instilling a doubt in jacks mind he
must be bothered of course tommy
did not know then that the galveston
giant was just as cocky and confident as
he was himself

  that esteem perhaps more than any-
thing else helped carry tommy burns
to the top of the ladder he was al-
ways sure that he could carry out any
task to which he set his hand

  he became a champion too even
though his championship was won in a
weak and futile period and a champion
must be a real man
no bell to save him

by will h greenfield

a battling fool was bud mccloskey    he fought on the streets in stables
on ferryboats-all to educate his mitts for one purpose to get sol bippus

i was what you might call fasci-
nated by the boxing game when i
was a mere youngster and the name
of bud mccloskey was known in the
pugilistic world just as soon as i was
big and strong enough to take care of
myself i never could imagine anything
more really enjoyable than a mill with a
man who could take and give without
squealing i guess i was great for the
sport from the cradle for i know that
when i started in to scrap life seemed
just one big meaningless jumble

  each fight flight at the old eureka
club after i was about ten years old
little bud could be seen standing out-
side asking every fighter passing into
the arena lets carry your grip
mister

  in this way i got to know all the
glove-pushcrs and witnessed boxing-
matches free and as i grew older i got
the opportunity to jump into the ring--
not to box but to swing a towel and
rub the weary limbs of some of the per-
formers

  it was while t was playing second
that t first ran across mr sol bippus
the english champion and collected the
grouch that later sent me after the
laurels of the briton

  bippus was -booked to box young
obrien one night and i laid for the
blooming blinker outside of the club and
coaxed him to take me in my cup of
happiness slopped over when he stripped
for action and asked me to swing a
towel for him

  now champion bippus had a rotten
opinion of managers and seconds he
had a manager dan mccabe a former
boxer but dan cut a very small figure
sol could not appreciate the value of a
mentor who was ready to divide his
earnings in the ring

  he claimed that if his fighting ability
was worth so much money he was en-
titled to the lions share and lie believed
he knew enough about the game to pick
his antagonists he had a high opinion
of his own methods of milling

  besides yours rcspcctfully he had




fight stories

brisk gillen and sparrow golden in his
corner-two wise birds in the art of the
manly of course i wasnt expected to
ladle out any advice but before the bout
this was what bippus said

  i dont want any advice from you
fellows one of you just fan me and
have the lemon-peel ready while the kid
is rubbing my legs and the other
can sponge my face and neck but
thats all ill do the thinking for all
of us

  ive got to hand it to the bounder he
was some fighter i believe that young
obrien who was anything but a slob
complained to his handlers that sol was
hitting him with a shot-filled hose be-
fore the end of the third round mr
obrien had taken all of the medicine
his system would hold and for the rest
of the six-round session he made any
records that the first battle of bull run
produced look like the funeral march
of the crippled consumptives band

  this was the night before thanksgiv-
ing i remember for billy murphv one
of the best and squarcst sporting editors
that ever boosted a boxer said obrien
did not attend services next day because
he was averse to going to church in a
spirit of sarcasm

  for six rounds i swung a towel and
rubbed the english champion proud of
the chance but expecting a decent piece
of change just the same sol slipped
me a thin dime-one large juicy tcn-
cent piece the tenth part of what i was
usually paid by the preliminary boys

  say bippus i says i thought the
original tightwad was the fellow that
saved the tips of his shoe-laces and sold
them for old iron but you put it all
over him

  well take it from me i got every-
thing that was coming to me and then
some mr bippus passed me a wallop
in the nose that broke that section of
my scenery and cuffed me around his
dressing-room until i dropped to the
floor all but dead he had things all
his own way i couldnt have hit him
then if i had tried and gillen and

golden had gone out as soon as they
were paid off

  it was a sweeping unequivocal vic-
tory for the english champion like the
man trying to make an honest dollar he
hadnt any competition

  to take a punch at sol bippus at that
stage of the game would have been too
much like trying to wipe a lump of ice
dry on a hot day so i just assembles all
my scattered parts and says meekly
some day old top im going to lick
you within an inch of your life and
dont you ever try to forget it

  sol made some crack about it being
quite too beastly impossible dont you
know and i evaporated next morn-
ing billy murphy prints this in his
paper

  in the person of sol bippus english cham-
pion poverty faces the most energetic and
unrelenting foe which it has ever encountered

  billy took this crack at the briton be-
cause i told him about the ten-cent-tip
business and the little reprimand that
had been handed to me in the cham-
pions dressing-room

  i hope youll make good some day
says billy id like to see that cheap
skate murdered in the ring

  thats just where im going to kill
him mr murphy i says you can
take it from me theres nothing going
to give me the same pleasure that this
job will if i live to be the king of the
bunch and earn a million bucks

well i settled right down in earn-
est from that time on and it
wasnt long before i was earning a nice
obese livelihood with my mitts and
you can take it from me that i had to
fight some to get the money for in those
days you couldnt haul down the long
green as you can now

  on the level the prizefighters job
was not so soft the modern fighter
ought to pat himself on the back and
accept his personal congratulations that
he was not mixing it in those days

  i know i would rather win a battle
and not receive a cent than lose and re-
no bell to save him



ceive hundreds i was out to fight and
i was out to win and i fought many a
finish fight with skin-tight gloves for
less money than the present-day fighters
get for a six-round bout

   i fought  the streets in stables on
ferry-boats in garrets-wherever there
was a purse to be won by using the mitts
i was on the job i had to keep busy
big purses were as rare as a good
restaurant and managers who fed you
for talking through the sporting pages
were as hard to find as yesterdays
paper

  i give it to you straight i got my
share of the fights and asked for more

  but while i was always ready to wipe
up the circumjacent real estate with any-
thing in shoe-leather as hilly murphy
put it i never lost sight of the fact that
my sole aim in life was to get a fight
with sol bippus and kick the eternal
sawdust out of him

  t boxed the boxers and slugged with
the sluggers and there wasnt a whole
lot in the fight game that wasnt used
on me at one time or another and the
best of it was i was a guy who could
learn a whole lot through the medium
of a licking

  i seldom let the same guy slaughter
me twice in the same place as you
might say and it got to be a saying that
whenever bud mccloskey dropped a
fight he was a sure winner the second
time out against the same opponent
the height of my ambition was to lick
the english champ and t prayed that i
might do it even if i had immediately
thereafter to resume my place in
oblivion

  well i was finally hooked up with
sol bippus but the best i could get was
a ten-round no-decision affair can you
imagine other fighters roasting me to a
dark brown because of my luck thats
what happened though after working
hard every day practicing always
fighting everything that came along and
taking some artistic trimmings just as
soon as i grabbed a bout with the cham-
pion they called me lucky

  i guess i told you before that bippus
was as fast as a jack-rabbit within the
roped arena and one of the trickiest pu-
gilists that ever put on a mitt well he
hadnt lost anything when i met him
and opportunities to slam him were as
scarce as true charity between society
ladies

 young obrien called him the old
fox and the name fitted him like a coat
of paint as you will agree when i
hand you this account of our little argu-
ment written by billy murphy

  young bud mccloskey a lad not yet nine-
teen years of age proved a tartar to cham-
pion sol bippus in a ten-round bout at the
eureka a c last night mccloskey fairly
tied bippus into knots with scientific boxing
of a high order and easily outpointed the
englishman by a wide margin

  it was the first time bippus was outpointed
in a local ring in young mccloskey he
found a boxing enigma he was unable to
solve bud was like a bounding ball on his
feet and circled bippus at all times sending
in smashing hooks swings uppercuts and
back-hand punches till the english champion
was wild with rage and totally bewildered by
the avalanche of alien fists

  mccloskcys defense was impregnable and
bippus in his rage hit him repeatedly on the
neck and kidneys to force him to draw down
his guard the crowd hooted and booed the
champion for this kind of fighting

  up to the eighth round there was nothing
to it but mccloskey then the englishman
caught him by a trick along toward the
end of the round when sol was feeling
groggy from excessive punishment he had
taken from the start he grabbed mccloskey
by the arms and shouted

  theres the bell bud

  mccloskey instantly turned toward his cor-
ner bippus with a smile knocked him against
the ropes with a right swing and was on
him like a tiger before he could recover his
dazed senses

  mccloskey stalled the round through hut
the effects of the swing were lasting and the
balance of the fight was all the englishmans

  in the ninth and tenth rounds bippus was a
whirlwind tie sent punches into mccloskey
from all angles by the aid of side steps shifts
and sudden lightninglike dashes

  in the final round he rocked mccloskey
with right and left swings and made him
cover up and hold on for dear life the bell
unquestionably saved bud from a knockout

  both boys tipped the beam at less than 
pounds ringside

some of the sporting-writers gave
the fight to bippus because he wore
the belt take it from me the fellow


fight stories

who fights a champ is always at a dis-
advantage writers and even referees
lean toward a title-holder

  you may really beat a champion out-
point him and everything hut in the
great majority of cases you will get
nothing better than a draw if you get
that any referee will hesitate about
taking away a title so almost the only
way to get the verdict is to knock the
champion cold

  of course i was ashamed of myself
for letting the briton maul me through
a trick but some wise guy once said
experience is a great teacher and t was
glad i stayed the limit because it meant
that i would have another bout with
him

  thats two beatings you owe me
says bippus to me after its over if
they have you on with me again old
soldier youll owe me three

  ill pay my debts mr bippus says
i i guess you didnt find this last dis-
cussion quite as easy as the dressing-
room affair

  not quite he says but ill make
the next session your farewell appear-
ance in any ring

  strangely enough a good portion of
the fight fans and critics thought i stood
no more chance with bippus than snow-
flakes before the sun and did not hesi-
tate to say so naturally this did not
get me anything for when i asked for
another try at the champ the eureka
management grinned and said they
couldnt afford to pay a consistent loser

  we can put you  for the picture-
money they told me and then pro-
ceeded to explain that a moving-picture
concern which desired pictures of the
english champion in action might be
induced to let me have twenty-five or
fifty dollars the eureka management
had to puy bippus too much money for
his appearance to add anything to this
so i was told to take it or leave it i
took it so the match was made for ten
rounds

  i hurried off to billy murphy with
the news

  bud says billy sadly theyve
pulled one across on you or my name
is sweeney the only time sol bippus
ever fought before a moving-picture
machine was when he met dutch wick
he loves to pose-just loves it-so he
didnt put wick away in the early part
of the fight as he could have easy
enough but just let things drag along
until wick got his strength back then
with bippus carelessly posing for the
pictures dutch come across with a
knockout after that sol swore hed
never fight for the films again

  but therell be lots of money in it
for him billy i says and you know
what a high regard he has for the cur-
rent coin of the realm

  even so says billy but i cant
believe theres a chance of him standing
for the film company getting in  it
i think theyve got you signed up to
fight for nothing when the time comes
and billy was right a tall sallow-
complexioned gent by the name of mark
nubim came to me in my dressing-
room on the night of the fight and asked
me if i had any objections to fighting
before the movie camera

  none in the world says i seeing
im not getting a four-cent piece any-
where else

  i am sorry for you young feller
he says -but bippus has made a mon-
key out of you and out of me he
didnt say anything until tonight then
after id got here with my men and the
machine to take the pictures he told
me flat that he wouldnt fight for the
films

  im mark nubim president of the
nubim film company and i increased
my offer of three hundred dollars to
six hundred dollars but i couldnt
reach him when i asked him why he
wouldnt stand for the camera he called
me names that a bucko mate wouldnt
use on a deaf paralytic

  he seems to think hes the kind of
champion that comes in a case by him-
self packed in cotton and invoiced sepa-
rately i asked him to name his figure
no bell to save him



and he only cursed me the more now
we will only take outside pictures of
the crowd and bippus after the fights
over

  mr nubim i says its not money
but conceit that prevents him from giv-
ing his classic postures to the movies
and he may get a little bliss out of the
fact that i agreed to go into this thing
for the picturc-money

  well says mr nubim i didnt
know they had you tied up like that
but ill tell you what ill do you lick
sol bippus and ill give you that fifty
dollars just the same as if we took the
pictures

i couldnt wait till i got that en-
glishman into the ring after that
and the opening bell was as welcome to
me as hot soup on a cold day i started
off feinting jabbing and blocking and
i wasnt taking the chances of a tinhorn
gambler with loaded dice

  youre a pretty husky young chap
says bippus starting in to josh me
but a real champion has to have brains
as well as brawn

  well i comes back at him some
champions are getting along with so
little of either i still have hopes
your hopes may bud they wont
never blossom he says

  you see he thought he had quite a
delicate wit sickly i called it

  youd better play close to the
cushion he teased youre a fair
boxer

  passing fair t declared jabbing
him in the mouth passing fair and
others i know arc already past get
me and i shook him up with a nice
right uppercut that brought the tears
to his eyes

  dont spoil my beauty he says
this is the only face i got

  sol says i youre mighty near
out of face tts a good thing you
turned down the nubim picture-pcople
im out here fighting for nothing-just
to beat you to a jelly

  from the way youre peckin at me

says he i should say you dont hold
spite

  well we took things so easy in the
opening chapters that the crowd started
to hiss and shout fake in the fifth
round i took the bit in my teeth at the
outset and inside o two minutes t had
battered sols face almost to a pulp
my rapid-fire rights and lefts delivered
at short range seldom went wrong and
when the round was over i seemed to
have a pretty fair chance of winning

  toward the close of the sixth round
sol inflicted considerable body-punish-
ment that rather slowed me up but i
was merrily pegging away at him in the
seventh he tried several tricks think-
ing to catch me napping but he soon
found t was wide awake and watching
with happy interest all that was going
on around me

  over and over again i watched for
indications of a left lead and scored in
advance of him and when i stood away
and boxed him he was apparently all
at sea he was as steady as a rock
under punishment and seemed to pin
his faith to a right-hand body-punch

  time after time after being worsted
 heart-breaking rallies that carried us
from one end of the ring to the other
he would reach my body with right
and left smashes the impact of which
was heard in the farthest corners of the
arena try as t would i could not
escape these onslaughts although i
laughed at him and told him he wasnt
hurting me a little bit

  youll feel em after a while he
says smiling as best he could with his
puffed face and split lips

  im having the time of my life 
tells him pecking his phiz to pieces all
the while

  his big blond facc was gashed and
bruised his lips were torn and his
nostrils filled with blood his protrud-
ing chin glistened with the gore that
welled over his lips but lie kept wink-
ing in a joshing manner at his seconds
who were dancing around and yelling
like comanches
	fight

  at the end of the ninth round sol
pulls his rally he ripped in a blow
that seemed to take my last breath and
go through my stomach like a bayonet
and as i stood open mouthed dazed for
the time being he clipped me on the
jaw with his right the first punch he
had landed above the shoulders for sev-
eral rounds

  down i goes to my knees and when
i came up without taking the count he
was on top of me like a thousand of
brick fighting like a tiger he began
to volley with both gloves my head was
tilting and jerking under the impact of
plunging lefts or rasping rights and sol
was going with lightning speed and hit-
ting at the right time when the bell
rang it sure was some sweet music to
me

  i guess ill have to let billy murphy
tell you the rest of it

  the last round resolved itself into a ques-
tion of the survival of the fittest science
was forgotten the fighters battled all around
the ring head to head shoulder to shoulder
and slugged away as though the fight had
just began with the referee frantically trying
to pull them apart

  when bippus staggered to the center of
the ring for the beginning of the tenth round
his only hope of winning lay in a knockout
punch lie had been whipped decisively dur-
ing the last nine rounds but his wonderful
recuperative powers brought him up in almost
as good condition as mccloskey who was
weak and unsteady from the terrific pace he
had set and the grueling work of the ninth
round

  both men swung in one blind blow after
another as they charged each other around
the ring with first one and then the other
doing the chasing mccloskey dropped the
englishman after a minute of fierce fighting
but when bippus got up he ran into a clinch

  bud shook him off but was in no condition
to take advantage of the situation on the
neck chest and arms mac showered useless
punches with bippus clinching and holding
on to save himself

  suddenly bippus let fly a haymaker that
caught mccloskey on the point of the jaw
and laid him back over the ropes in his own
corner with his arms hanging to his sides
knees bending under him and a blind stare
in his eyes the yankee was at the mercy of
his foe

  dazed by the punishment he had taken and
crazed by the thought of a possible victory
bippus squinted through swollen eyes and
shook his bloody gloves in an uncertain man-
ner as though trying to decide which of the

stories

nineteen mccloskeys he would attack he
swayed forward with a right swing and the
bewildered and battleworn mccloskey slipped
to the floor

  slowly bud got up he reeled his legs
quivering under him his head wabbling from
side to side like a man with the palsy he
forgot all about putting his hands up to his
face to protect it just as he overlooked the
chance to remain on the floor and take the
count

  bippus tottering on two legs that were
scarcely able to bear his own weight managed
to drive home another right to the jaw mc-
closkey fell in a heap his arms legs and mus-
cles twitching convulsively

  after many efforts he finally pushed him-
self to his hands and knees nobody thought
he would rise but by a supreme effort he got
up on to one knee

  just as his hands left the floor he lost all
power in his legs his brain became numb and
lie rolled over to the floor of the ring help-
less and dead to the world

i came to my senses in a few sec-
onds and in five minutes was as
well as ever trying to dodge out of
the rear entrance of the club i bumped
square into bippus bowing bareheaded
to a wildly cheering throng

  youre the cheapest guv in the busi-
ness he says you took an awful
licking for nothing

  you can well imagine i wasnt feel-
ing too much like joshing with him i
tried to get away without any more
talk but he was feeling too good to let
me beat it just then

  i says he sneers at me blocking
my way i says youre cheap and your
revenge is a long time coming you
aint got any spite in you and i think
youre yellow-ill bet you went out to
avoid punishment

  can you picture it taking an un-
holy beating-and giving one too-and
then being called a quitter by a man
you had missed sending into dreamland
only by a hair-line margin

  the blood shot through me like red-
hot arrows before i realized what i
was doing i hit mr bippus a whack
on the ear a left hook sent him down
on the pavement and after that he was
kept busy getting up

  there was no bell to save him no
minute rests in which to recuperate
no bell to save him



and my bare knuckles found him an easy
mark what i couldnt accomplish in
twenty rounds with the gloves i com-
pleted in less than two minutes of
rough-and-tumble stuff i cleaned off
the sidewalk with mr sol bippus and
tossed him into the street the worst
licked champion that ever drew breath

  they carried him back to his dress-
ing-room again but as i stepped aside
for them to pass he raised his head
feebly and said youre chock full of
spite but youre cheap

  and i was inclined to agree with
him until the next morning when
i received a visit from mr nubim

official of the nubim film company

  mccloskey he said handing me an
envelope heres my check for six hun-
dred dollars you earned every cent of
it the battle in the ring wasnt a cir-
cumstance to the one on the outside
and im handing you the champions
end of the picture-money

  gee mr nubim i says still
bewildered you must have got a
lot of satisfaction out of that street
fight

  i did he says slamming me on the
back but ill get something more than
that bud it was the outside affair we
took pictures of

upsetting a jinx

brilliant courage and gameness in defiance of all the traditional jinxes
and hoodoos of the squared circle was displayed by a singer when he
crushed the championship aspirations of ignacio fernandez the dynamite-
fisted filipino at madison square garden recently in the same ring ex-
actly one year and seven days previously the filipino had knocked singer
cold as a wedge

   the battle was a classic of ring history sensational from the tap of the
opening gong until the end of the last round fight critics agree that it
ranks with the best contests in the lightweight division since the historic
battles between leonard and tendler a dozen years ago singer opened
by knocking the tough filipino flat in the first round for the first knockdown
recorded in the long career of the brown-skinned lad again in the second
round fernandez hit the canvas thereafter the slugging continued with-
out a pause and at the end singer the bronx bombardier held a command-
ing lead at times it appeared that the filipino would go down for the long
count but his extraordinary stamina carried him through

   singers feat in decisively beating an opponent who had previously hung
the kayo sign on him is one infrequently chronicled in prize ring annals it
takes one back to the classic battles of stanley ketchel and bill papke
ketchel was middleweight champion of the world when he was knocked out
by papke-and then came back a short time later to reverse the situation and
regain the title other champions and near-champions have tried the feat
but when a fighter has once hung the kayo sign  an opponent the mental
hazard of entering the ring again with such a conqueror has been almost
insurmountable and few have shown the ability courage and determination
to come off victors in a subsequent encounter

fighters all

by arthur j burks

author of phantom of the resin 

the war was over but the call to battle was still high in the hearts of the
fighting acting-jack and his pals something must break and it did

they fought mightily under the
banner of jack mcnamara who
once in old marine corps days
had been known as the fighting acting-
jack an acting-jack is a lance cor-
poral or a private who is about to be
but isnt yet a corporal

 as an acting-jack mcnamara had
never taken advantage of his position
he had never hidden behind his rank
cither real or prospective though he had
avoided fist fights after he became a
first lieutenant then he had been mus-
tered out and the world had turned
topsy-turvy because the war had ended
he was back to the world of workaday
things

  blue-eyed jack mcnamara who had
had a taste of dealing with fighting men
had discovered that he couldnt do it
plodding was too slow for a man who
liked to run never again would he re-
main long in one place the world was
wide and there was always something


doing for the man who liked adventure

  jack in the old days had been as
good a light heavyweight as the marine
corps boasted and he had never avoided
a fight nor had he ever been knocked
out though there had been some of his
rookies who accepting the opportunity
he offered to take him on if they didnt
like the way he ran them had almost
put him to sleep

  but each time he had weathered the
scrambles of fisticuffs and had whipped
the men who had challenged him-and
had moreover made them his friends
for life

  there was dick rollins for example
whom he had whipped until the big fel-
low was out on his feet and had still
been unable to wipe the smile from his
adversarys face jack had refused to
hit him again had conceded the victory
and when jacks boys had marched
away rollins had called jack a white
man before them all and had taken him
fighters all



by the hand rollins had covered him-
self with glory overseas and had re-
turned

  tommy elms the punkiest marine
who ever wore the uniform the fastest
lightweight who ever wore a regulation
service glove had covered himself with
glory overseas he too had come back

  and big gallagher whom jack had
whipped to a whisper because the big
boy had talked too much-well gall-
agher had covered himself with glory
overseas too but he hadnt come
back

  of the dozen or so men whom jack
mcnamara as the fighting acting-jack
had fought at mare island and at
quantico including elam carney only
four met with jack that afternoon in
san franciscos chinatown five dis-
contented men who had been disap-
pointed when the war had ended be-
cause they werent yet ready for the
excitement to die down

  somehow jack had got them together
somehow he had found them some-
how they had managed to reach this
chinese restaurant where now the five
of them sat and raked up the past

  jack mcnamara was the spokesman
the chairman of the meeting

  well boys he said somewhat
thickly because of feelings he didnt
thoroughly understand the wars
over

  it seems so said tommy elms im-
patiently matter of fact i think the
newspapers mentioned quite some time
ago you just find out

  oh cut it tommy always talk-
ing out of turn you were the punkiest
marine who ever wore a leather collar
or went without one

  and you retorted elms were the
punkest drillmaster who ever bawled
out a rookie

  why this solemn meeting anyway 
snapped big elam carney whyd you
bring us here jack

  excitement retorted mcnamara

  yeah whats the fun of chinning
in a morgue

  yeah said tommy elms whats
the bad news

jack mcnamara merely grinned
a half-hearted grin at these men
he had known so well in the old days
then he spoke swiftly for a time the
men listened impatiently then they be-
gan to lean forward in their chairs
then smiles of anticipation wreathed
their faces

  tommy said mcnamara to elms
in the old days you used to get five
hundred berries a week from home for
spending money save any of it
nope said elms but why for
theres always more where that came
from what do you want is this a
touch 

  in a way yes i take it that you
guys are all kinda wormy like i am
and that youd do almost anything for
some excitement else you wouldnt have
met me here am i right well heres
what i propose now i know every
darned one of you as a matter of fact
ive whipped every darned one of you
at one time or another except tommy
here and he was too far below my
weight

  good excuse said elms grinning
i could whip you with one hand tied
behind me but excuse the rude in-
terruption you were saying

  ive whipped every one of you and
if you tommy make another crack like
that ill turn you across my knee
these guys going to help you
snorted the lightweight

  oh dry up elms snapped carney
or ill turn you across my knee my-
self  go on jack

  well there are five of us we can
all fight elms here because he isnt
good for much of anything else can
pay expenses until we get going well
ill manage the outfit well join our-
selves into a band of fisticuffing strollers
playing the small towns first until we
get our reputations worked up then
smashing into big time youve all got
guts with the possible exception of-


fight stories

tommy for you all stayed with me un-
til i knocked you out-

  jack grinned at them all as he spoke
and jaws tightened as memory went
back to the fights to which he referred
all friends here but once they hadnt
been and mcnamara had knocked them
silly but they said nothing as he
talked on

  -and besides youve all been ma-
rines thats something to start with
now i wont stand for anything rough-
neck get that well just be a clean
bunch of boys going up and down in
the land to show the natives that boxing
is cleaner than a lot of them think
and in a years time said elms
well know how every jail smells and
looks from the inside in every town we
visit

  mcnamara lighted a particularly evil
smelling cigar and waited hed said all
he intended saying

  im on exploded big elam carney
who once had been a corporal

  and t said ahred aaronson who
once had been known as the battling
bollshevik because he hadnt taken
kindly to marine corps discipline

  three said rollins as though he
were once more counting off as his
half-platoon fell in on the old mare
island parade ground

  four snapped mcnamara

  what do i say snapped tommy
elms insolently i once got whanged
on the conk with a swagger stick for
yelling five when four was as high as
they counted

  i never whanged a man with a swag-
ger stick in my life barked mcna-
mara youre just a plain liar elms
careful said elms shaking his
head judiciously or your banker will
spank

  just yell cash said aaronson and
youre elected

  elms laughed

  cash he said how much do we
need 

  five hundred said mcnamara
after a thoughtful pause will see us

to los angeles after we get there
well make a stab at getting our ex-
penses

once more was jack mcnamara
in his element he knew every
one of his fighters they had been tried
in the crucible and had not been found
wanting they would fight like trojans
for mcnamara in spite of their
grumbling and they were good clean
boys

  once more as they shadow-boxed
until the sweat covered their faces like
rain and as they daily paced their mile
after mile of road work until they were
leg-weary and ready to drop jack
thought of mare island days of the
mats placed on the tile floor of the
gymnasium of the smack of fists
slammed home in grudge fights of the
slither of light shoes over canvas he
knew his arrangement had been an in-
spiration it was a substitute for days
that were gone

  lie had visited the various los ange-
les newspapers and whispered into the
cars of sport writers his belief that he
had five boxers-all ex-marines-who
could whip their weight in wildcats
jack had been dubiously received
fly away kid they told him
weve had so many things slipped over
on us that we dont believe in anything
any more

  but just the same they wrote his
boys up in order to fill the space they
had to fill and they filled it with satire
and sarcasm mcnamaras stable they
averred stood as much chance to stand
up against professional fighters as ice
cream on a hot stove

  my boys are clean livers jack had
told them and the clean boys win in
the long run

  but nobody would listen jack told
his boys elms wired for money and
they backed themselves with cold cash
mcnamara rented a barn-like building
built a ring and dressing-rooms got the
necessary licenses and issued challenges
to whosoever cared to offend
fighters all



  the crowd refused them that first
night but professional fighters were out
for money and mcnamara had offered
some-on a winner-take-all basis but
the newspaper boys had done their stuff
and the crowd stayed away some news-
paper lads came however to yawn end-
lessly as the first bout was delayed inter-
minably

  it was a scrap between tommy elms
and baby amador the latter a rugged
little mex who according to rumor had
won his last six starts by knockouts
and had himself never been knocked
out

  mcnamara though billed to fight the
main event himself against sailor law-
son another fast boy smiled quietly
as tommy elms entered the ring and
amador exercised his right to keep the
fans and elms waiting mcnamara
knew his men and he knew tommy
elms

amador stepped through the
ropes and here and there people
who had somehow condescended to pur-
chase tickets glanced to the right and
left at the empty seats around them

  tommy elms eternally grinning
with his eyes half-closed as though he
were on the verge of falling asleep
yawning at intervals to keep up the pre-
tense was not even looking at amador
when the bell signaled the beginning of
the first round

  amador swept across the ring like a
brown cyclone intent upon catching
elms in his corner and knocking him
for a loop before he could get set the
thin crowd and the newspaper men
moved forward in their chairs

  yawning seeming not to move at all
elms slipped out of danger and the
charging amedor crashed into his cor-
ner striking out at a man who hadnt
waited for him

  elms slipped to the center of the ring
looking at mcnamara

  lets go tommy cried jack no
fooling now

  and the half asleep elms uncoiled

like a whiplash as amador thrashed
around and came charging back elms
was fast on his feet fast as they came
and when he moved he just simply
seemed to sift from one spot to the
other like something oiled amador had
a few black marks on his recond and
had just been reinstated by the state
boxing authorities fouls when the
referee couldnt see thumbs in eyes
butting all the dirty tricks the ring has
discovered and some of his own inven-
tion tricks which had gone for to dis-
credit boxing as a wholesome sport

  amador always went in to win and
he didnt care especially how he did it
there were others like amador but
not tommy elms

  amador as he crashed out arm flail-
ing smashed his long right at tommys
stomach and tommy knew that the
blow would land low only he wasnt
there to catch it instead he was off to
amadors right and his two hands were
slamming in one-twos that were head-
rocking in their sheer savagery but
every blow a clean one

  full and true they smacked to the
jaw of amador who whirled like a cat
and literally smothered tommy under
the fury of his onslaught or seemed to
the sound of his blows echoed through
the half empty building but the report-
ers who knew amador of old edged
forward expectantly and studied this
stranger elms

  tommy slipped out of harms way rs
though he had been greased he was
in and out like a rapier every time he
went in his two fists landed smugly and
every time he came out he did so ahead
of savage blows hurled at him by the
now furious amador blows which never
landed because tommy came in again
his fists sending in sledgehammer blows
to every part of amadors body

  then amador went down shrieking
foul foul

  tommy knew and mcnamara knew
that one savage right of elms had half
buried itself in amadors solar plexis
well above the belt line the referee


fight stories

saw it too and started counting over
amador amador came back his face
twisted as though he suffered agonies
his hands held low tommy turned
away from him to a neutral corner
leaned on the ropes grinning

  and amador suddenly crouching
low stomach drawn back to invisibil-
ity left hand extended lips drawn back
in a soundless snarl started shifting
forward moving with deceptive speed
his little black eyes boring into those of
elms

  and elms glancing again at mc-
namara tore into the mexican he
tore into him like a young tornado his
right and left worked without ceasing
and though he took a few blows him-
self he shot in his fists from every
angle and he shot them in all the
time

  amador had to give ground for his
head was rocking from side to side on
his shoulders as rights and lefts came
in and when he gave ground elms
slammed in like a battering-ram his
own teeth were exposed now in what
looked like a snarl but which was
merely his way of breathing

  amador refused to back-pedal before
this bird who hadnt got enough space
in the dailies to be worth mentioning
why amador in the last issue-

  then amador found himself flat on
his back his dazed eyes staring up at
the cluster of lights above the ring
while the referee tolled off the fatal sec-
onds  elms was in a neutral corner ex-
amining the right hand which he had
smashed to the jaw of amador with
crushing force

  amador would never get up

the bell rang as the referee counted
nine and amadors seconds carried
him to his stool working over him re-
viving the little battler for more blood-
shed as he came out for the second
round elms showed amador the space-
grabber the dirty fighter what a real
fighter could do and do cleanly

  his fists smacked home again and

again and each blow seemed even more
powerful than the last until amador
was staggering around the ring like a
drunken man mad as a hatter always
dangerous his red-rimmed eyes staring
his hatred at this nobody who was giv-
ing him the lacing of his career

  he slammed into a clinch hft right
came up the heel of his glove caught
elms under the chin snapped his head
back amadors left shot into elms
face tilting back the chin anew the
right slammed over and elms went
down

  at five he got up when he got up
he was charging while blood trickled
from his split lips and though his chin
was to the fore he paid no heed to the
rights and lefts of amador and his
own fists drummed a steady tattoo on
the face of the mexican he rushed
amador to the ropes crowded him
against them

  i hate a dirty fighter amador he
said softly to the other

  then with amador half hanging over
the ropes elms right came up in a
blow that traveled no more than a foot
but which might have traveled all the
way from the floor and its smack
against amadors jaw caused the press
reporters to groan softly in sympathy
the mexican fell as a hewn tree falls
and was counted out

  the newspapermen started scribbling

a aronson went on for the sec-
ond fight and he started driving
his opponent a black boy with the kick
of dynamite in either hand from the
first bell and never once during that
savage first round did aaronson take
a back step he slammed the black boy
with rights and lefts he hammered him
until the colored lads knees buckled
and he started to fall

  the negro went down and aaronson
took his place against the ropes in a
neutral corner waiting for him to rise
which he did he came up at seven
set himself to receive the charge of
aaronson and aaronson nothing loath
fighters all



barged in at top speed all set to hand
out the sleep producer

  he slipped on a wet spot in the cen-
ter of the ring and fell forward his
hands before his face to stay his fall
and the right fist of his opponent car-
rying with it all his power all his anger
at this white boy who had downed him
came up in an almost invisible uppercut
catching aaronson straight on the chin

  aaronson fell

  the reporters stated that the wet spot
had been his undoing that aaronson
had been miles ahead even though but
two minutes of the bout had passed and
the black boy boasted little of his win

  there was something about these
boys of mcnamaras who fought be-
cause they loved the game because they
loved it when it was clean and fought
to win so the newspapermen scribbled
some more

  then elam carney-big carney who
roared with the laughter of enjoyment
while he fought no matter how terrific
the drubbing he was taking entered
against big bill garrick another one
of the cauliflower brigade which fights
for money chalk marbles or for coffee
and crullers because it is all they know

  for five rounds the two big men
blood streaming from their split lips
their bashed in noses and with cuts over
their eyes fought all over the ring the
four sides of which were always sway-
ing and dancing for it was scarcely
large enough for men of their size

  carney went down twice in the sec-
ond three times in the third but every
time he got up he grinned anew and
launched an attack that seemed tireless
despite the knockdowns once garrick
turned to his manager

  ive slapped him with the best i
got he yelled and he wont go down
his head and chin are concrete

  and carney recalling the old days
when he had fought with mcnamara
knocking down the two huge stoves in
the quantico barracks laughed aloud

  he set himself easily running away
from garrick his right foot clung to

the floor and so did his left an oddly
awkward stance garrick followed him
his objective was the chin of carney
for carney when concentrating deeply
had a habit of thrusting his tongue
doubled between his teeth and screw-
ing up his forehead prodigiously a
blow to the chin now would drop him
and cut his tongue half off and so
garrick aimed his right-

  from the floor just ahead of gar-
ricks blow came the murderous right
hand of carney garrick caught it full
and true high on the temple and it
packed a wallop that not even the
heavyweight champ of the marines in
the old days had been able to weather
and garrick his mouth gaping open in
hurt surprise almost turned over in the
air as he shot backward his feet leav-
ing the canvas

  carney roared with laughter pulled
in his tongue which had trapped gar-
rick and as the referee counted ten over
garrick the newspapermen scribbled
some more

  in the fourth fight rollins fought
jack murphy to a draw which left the
scribes gasping at the end of the sixth
round for both fighters were out on
their feet

  they both got the duke but rollins
adversary was frowning and furious
and rollins was wearing that quiet
smile which mcnamara in that never
to be forgotten battle at mare island
years ago had not been able to knock
off

jack mcnamara his heart sing-
ing the old song of battle entered
the ring for the last fight of the eve-
ning a ten round go against a light-
heavy weight who could not fight in new
york because he had been suspended
for various infractions

  he could fight this mannie lucho
and he feared nothing that could don
gloves but he fought with all the tricks
of the trade as mcnamara knew when
after the first exchange his stomach be-
low the belt felt as though he had par


fight stories

taken of a heavy dinner of live coals

  ill get you for that mannie mc-
namara told him and barged in

  mcnamara set himself to fight at top
speed for the whole ten rounds de-
termined to show the small crowd and
the newspapermen that a clean man
could out-last a man who wasnt en-
tirely clean in all ways

  at the signal the crowd had left its
seats and now crowded those nearest
the ring

  and mannie and mcnamara were at
it fighting bitterly mcnamara thought
again of the old joy of smacking gloves
the scrape-scrape of shoes over canvas
pondered on the welfare of the grand
old game and resolved to show the
audience that clean men fought too

  and even as he thought he drove
rights and lefts to mannie lucho ham-
mered away at him without ceasing
squinted his blue eyes and bored in

  smack-smack-smack-smack

  four times two rights two lefts
mcnamara left his mark on the face
of mannie lucho then they clinched
and mannics elbow cracked against the
jaw of mcnamara

  quick as light stepping free of the
clinch his jaw exposed for an infinitesi-
mal instant in his fury at the trick mc-
namara whipped over his left and his
right shaking the hard head of lucho
on that worthys shoulder forcing him
to back-pedal forcing him against the
ropes off which lucho bounded like a
rubber ball his fists flailing

  straight and true mcnamaras right
hand slapped to luchos nose and
luchos hands slipped up swiftly to pro-
tect the suddenly distorted member
quick as a flash mcnamaras right
slammed into luchos stomach and
mannies hands dropped again to
cover the stomach avhile mcnamaras
right fled like a homing pigeon to
the jaw

  lucho staggered and mcnamara went
after him like a wildcat slugging it out
taking all lucho had to send a paean
of rejoicing going up from his fight-

loving soul as he forced lucho to open
his mouth like a gasping fish and pant
like a spent runner

  from then on through ten gruelling
rounds they fought toe to toe slugging
it out in the corners in the center of
the ring and against the ropes luchos
eyes were almost closed mcnamaras
teeth blood-stained were visible
under the glare of the lights because
lucho had cut his lips with the heel
of his glove laying back the flesh

  and in the tenth with one minute
to go mcnamara lowered his head and
sailed in whenever he uppercutted
lucho he lifted his own right shoulder
his right toe merely touched the floor
as the blows landed and their savage
intensity could be well imagined by those
who watchecf

  thirty seconds to go and the little
crowd yelling lustily for a knockout
mcnamara and lucho trying their level
best to satisfy them

  s mack-smack-s mac h

  two drumming lefts to the face a
smashing right that traveled eight
inches and lucho went down whipped
by a man with the courage to fight
clean even against a dirty fighter and
to fight for all lie was worth all the
time by a man who loved the game
when it was rightly played who hated
men who used roughneck tactics

  and the scribes scribbled anew

next morning there were fresh
sport notes in all los angeles
papers the prides of the ring had been
humbled by men out of nowhere break-
ing pedestals which the unworthy had
occupied and the press acclaimed them

  but when the scribes went out to look
up the fighters that morning they could
not find them

  that same afternoon the newspaper
boys received a wire from mcnamara
who was headed north with his ex-
marines

  clean out the stables and well come
back its not the game thats rotten
but some of the gents who play it

in a million would have realized what
max meant youve got to be a bit up
on the history of this heavyweight
business-and know your fouls to boot

  schmeling is not the first foreign
heavyweight to come into this country
seeking championship honors and it is
a strange coincidence that the first
english heavyweight champion who
journeyed westward to fight for the
worlds title also was involved in a
foul fracas only this time it was the
american who was fouled

  it was the first instance of a foul

  it seems that hack in  mike

cocky englishman who thought he could
belt the daylights out of any man living
and he went afar to prove his conten-
tion he came over in  together
with joe wormald and ned obaldwin
the irish giant-the latter the first of
his kind so to speak

  allen settled in -st louis and -began
to walk around with a chip on his
shoulder obaldwin did likewise and
the same goes for joseph wormald

  mccool though he had been defeated
by joe coburn in sixty-seven rounds
the year allen arrived began to
attract notice despite that defeat

jimmy dunn a good one had beaten

  mccool took on the tough mr davis
and made a much ibetter job of whip-

things went in those glorious beef-

 wormald and obaldwin had been
haggling between themselves and wor-

he had the tough ones on this side of
the water there was a lot of present-

lenged obaldwin whom he seemed to
fear more than allen i suppose he
had real reason to fear ned was a
giant and mike donovan the old mid-

obaldwin was the greatest fighter that
ever lived he laughed when i asked
him if john l sullivan couldnt have
whipped ned

  there never was a man of obald-

said donovan ned could leap over
an ordinary mans head and could run
faster backward than the casual man
could run forward he liked his rum
-and his rum got him in the end said

  obaldwin refused to go back to
england to fight after having posted
a  forfeit and wormald claimed
the money this enraged obaldwin
and he challenged wormald to come
back which the chump did ned
knocked him kicking in ten minutes of
fighting in the first round you know
in those days a round didnt end until

the police jumped in and ned got the

place near lynfield mass 

  that fight spelled the finish of
obaldwin he never again figured
with the all-important ones his dis-
appearance from the limelight left it
right up to mccool and allen to settle
the row about the worlds title

there was a situation almost
identical with that of sharkey and
schmeling except that max of course
was in there the other night fighting as
the european and german champion
sharkey like mccool was glad to be
known as the american title-holder

  then came the first real worlds
heavyweight championship bout mc-
cool and allen fought near st louis
june  

  odd isnt it that that old battle and
the new were fought on almost the same
dates of the month but the action was
a little reversed

  the englishman was giving the
american title-holder a fine pasting
when mccool made claim of a foul it
must have been a raw one or else the
englishman got the worst of the deal
but in any event allen was disqualified
and the worlds title went to mccool

  the following year allen to prove
that he was a real champion met jem
mace his illustrious countryman at
kennersville la the woods were full
of english heavyweights iby this time
and mace was looked upon as the best
of the lot

  he proved it by whipping allen in
ten rounds as tom had gone into the
fight claiming the title mace assumed
that he was to be the wearer of the
crown from that point on

  allen before the fight said that mc-
cools claim couldnt stand up on its
own hind legs so mace made the most
of the situation the defeat by mace
didnt dampen allens ardor

  mace went on to meet joe coburn
for the american title they fought a
draw and then up foobbed mccool
again challenging allen they met
this time at allens lucky spot st
louis mo mccool was fairly beaten
through the ropes



this time allen bringing- him clown in
seven rounds twenty minutes of fight-
ing this was in 

   three years later allen lost his place
in the sun when joe goss loomed up
as an opponent

  again allen was guilty of an illegal
blow the light had gone twenty-seven
rounds-one hour and fifty-two min-
utes of slugging-when goss was ad-
judged the winner on a foul

  goss was rated the title-holder until
four years later when paddy ryan a
rising young giant bumped him off in
eighty-seven rounds at collier station
w va

  the lads of the olden days had to do
plenty of slugging to prove their su-
periority at times there were no gold-
slippered society gells at the goss-
ryan battle tex rickards best peo-
ple had not yet taken up the manly art
of self defense

  then came glorious old john l
sullivan a dashing youth of eighteen or
nineteen who was setting boston by
the ears he had sparred with pro-
fessor mike donovan then the middle-
weight champion and he had sent mike
into the orchestra pit of a boston show
house the professor taking a lot of
scenery with him

  mike got out of the bull-fiddle and
declared that sullivan was the
champion of all the blooming wide
world and mike meant it he
wasnt simply covering up a bad match
on his own part

  sullivan proved that he was a king-
pin when he knocked out paddy ryan
in nine rounds this gave him undis-
puted right to call himself the bare-
knuckle dandy of the lot and john
became quite serious about the claim

  he fought the last bare-knuckle fight
among heavyweights when he defeated
jake kilrain in seventy-five rounds-
two hours sixteen minutes twenty-
three seconds of desperate milling

  sullivan having claimed the bare-
knuckle title under old london prize
ring rules never actually lost the

crown tie and corbett met with
gloves under the queensberry rules

from the time tom allen fouled
goss in  right up to the
sharkey and schmeling fight no
worlds championship bout had been
marred by a vagrant blow

  it is a far cry from goss to
schmeling but there the facts stand
tt does seem that weve grown careless
as weve progressed in the heavyweight
ranks fouls arc all too frequent now
and the day will come when victory
through the medium of a foul blow
will not be allowed for the protection
of boxing from a promoting stand-
point a curb must -be found for the evil

  but letting the heavyweights out of
it for the time being it will rather sur-
prise you to learn just how many titles
have changed hands through foul
blows

  we come first to the most celebrated
foul blow in the history of the ring
but because it was a new sort of punch
the winner wasnt disqualified nor did
the champion knocked out iby the blow
lose his title i never could understand
why but such are the records

  george la blanche a husky young
sailor met jack dempsey the original
nonpareil in san francisco dempsey
had gone along until the thirty-second
round tormenting la blanche with the
wizardry of his attack dempsey was
a sharpshooter and he had la blanche
badly cut up still the husky sailor
plunged in hoping against hope that
the tide would come a sailors way for
once

  in a moment of superb boxing and
i daresay one of carelessness dempsey
dropped his guard low

  like a blast out of a quarry came a
punch the likes of which nobody had
ever seen before la blanche sud-
denly wheeled around in his tjracks on
the ball of his left foot his left held
out stiffly he whizzed all the way
around backwards and his list brought
up against dempseys jaw like a can-


fight stories

nonball the great middleweight went
down as if he had been drilled by a
pump gun he never moved a muscle
after lie hit the floor they were an
hour bringing him back

  the blow first called the la
blanche swing and in later years the
despised pivot blow was immediately
ruled out of boxing because of the
great love with which the fans held
dempsey they wanted to see that such
an unexpected tragedy couldnt happen
to him or any other fighter of the fu-
ture and that ban stands today

  la blanche instead of being hailed
as a great champion was ridiculed
wherever he went they counted the
knockout of dempsey the rankest kind
of a fluke and la blanche though it
was a startling victory couldnt make
it stand up

  young mitchell now a city official
of san francisco was in his prime as
one of the worlds greatest middle-
weights at that time he was greatly
attached to dempsey to avenge his
friend he challenged la blanche and
the marine was knocked out in twelve
rounds this gave mitchell quite a
claim on the title but he proved his
gallantry by stepping aside and turning
the title back to dempsey

  some of mitchells friends insisted
that he lay claim to the title but eventu-
ally the victory of la blanche was
snowed under and ignored when the
blow became an illegal one it wasnt
quite a square deal for la blanche up
to the time he used the blow nothing
had ever been done to rule against it
simply because it had never come up
as a menace to boxing before that time

  dempsey had stopped la blanche in
thirteen rounds in west larchmont
l i three years before the fatal blow
came into boxing but the defeat
through the pivot blow broke dempseys
heart he went to liquor he couldnt
get over the disgrace of being knocked
out by a third-rater and seldom after
that did he rise to his great height and
power as a fighter

  he defeated australian billy mc-
carthy in twenty-eight rounds and
then made the most tragic match of his
life someone must have told him he
could whip bob fitzsimmons he
never set eyes on the freckled one until
they came into the ring at new orleans
dempsey took one look at the amazing
physical freak before him the light-
weight legs and the heavyweight arms
and torso he went back to his corner
and said i cant possibly beat this
fellow

  he knew he was doomed fitz told
me that he begged jack to go down
without being hit along about the
seventh or eighth round and dempsey
told him that he would have to finish
him with a real knockout then bob
mercifully put all he had into the final
punch

  dempsey had three fights after that
and then he passed into the great be-
yond the best liked fighter of all time

when stanley ketchel was laid
low by an assassins bullet twenty
years ago the same title that dempsey
and fitz had owned was left without
a real owner

  billy papke who had knocked out
ketchel for the honor only to foe
knocked out himself in a return bout in
the same year claimed the title after
the great steves death he was gen-
erally recognized as the rightful
claimant

  two years later frank klaus won
the title from papke when billy was
disqualified in the fifteenth round in
paris george chip settled franks un-
certain honor by knocking him out in
five rounds in pittsburgh

  one year later chip was knocked
cold iby a mccoy a shambling left-
hander who didnt fill the shoes of the
great ones before him with any too
much glory

  we come down to the welterweight
division they had their fling of
championship fouls

  rube ferns met mysterious billy
through the ropes



smith for the title when tommy ryan
left the class because of increasing
weight it was a desperate battle and
smith always rough transgressed in
the twenty-first round of a fight in
buffalo

  matty matthews came along and got
the decision over ferns in fifteen
rounds at detroit one year later
ferns came back and knocked out
matthews in ten rounds at toronto
again assuming the title little joe
walcott with the tremendous arms
knocked ferns from under the gilded
kelly in five rounds at fort erie on-
tario

  and then came another change in
titles through a foul blow the dixie
kid won from walcott in the twen-
tieth round and though many refused
to believe that joe had committed a
foul the title went with the illegal
blow

  they came back again and this time
they fought a twenty-round draw prov-
ing at least that dixie was some pump-
kins since the great walcott had failed
to flatten him in forty rounds of fight-
ing it wasnt like joe to hold up any-
body in those days so at least both bat-
tles were on the level in that respect

  that ended the fouls in the welter
division

  willie ritchie came along to win the
lightweight title from ad wolgast in a
desperate fight that ended in a foul

  the title that had been see-sawing
back and forth since the day joe gans
defended it by claiming foul against
battling nelson at goldfield went to
ritchie and he was immediately rec-
ognized as the title-holder ritchie was
a good fighter and made a picturesque
champion

  he made one foolish mistake he
would have had great difficulty in out-
pointing freddie welsh on this side of
the water but nothing would do our
will but that he must go to london
town to defend the title against freddie
welsh

  old fred was a champion that night

and though ritchie always disputed the
decision which cost him the title at the
end of twenty rounds good judges who
saw the battle said that welsh won on
his merits

   it wasnt the safest place in the world
to defend a title no more than it would
be for jack sharkey or max schmeling
to go to england to fight phil scott for
the heavyweight crown

gans was taking a sound drubbing
from nelson at goldfield when he
wrent to the floor in a mix-up in the
forty-second round and george siler
awarded him the decision because he
said that nelson struck low

  the fight was to a finish-one of
those forty-five rounds-or-more affairs
-and joe couldnt have gone on much
further nelson always claimed that
joe took the easy way out he proved
it by stopping gans twice after that and
establishing himself as one of the great-
est lightweights of all time

  welsh after returning from england
with ritchies title went to denver to
light wolgast and again ad hit low
the referee disqualified him in the
eleventh round and welsh wore the
crown out of the ring after having had
quite a rough time of it

  george dixon who won the feather-
weight title on four different occasions
came into the crown on the third oc-
casion when dave sullivan fouled him
in the tenth round of a battle in new
york

  in the bantamweight division a few
crowns were teetered around on the
foul circuit

  kid williams was sailing along as the
title-bearer after he had knocked out
johnny coulon for the championship

  he met johnny ertle a tiny fighter
of st paul in the fifth round ertle
went to the floor from what he claimed
was a low blow and the referee was in
a quandary the minnesota laws did
not allow decisions and the referee
couldnt rule for or against either man
ertle stuck to his claim of foul and he


fight stories

became the champion though williams
was always disputing the claim

  to prove that williams and a lot of
others didnt think that ertle had any
right to the crown the title was gen-
erally regarded as having shifted to kid
herman when he gained a twenty-round
decision over williams

  surely herman has always been rec-
ognized as a fine little title man he
went to england to make it a world-
wide claim

and now we come back to old tom
allen he must have been a
tough bird for he lasted as a retired
man of old ring history until --the
year jeffries knocked out jack mon-
roe allen always maintained that
he was the only worlds champion
among the heavyweights who won lost
and regained his title

  his claim was that he lost the title
when he was defeated by jem mace in
 and that he won it back after he
had knocked out mike mccool three
years later

  right or wrong he will go down in

history as the fellow to set the fashion
in fouls in heavyweight championships

  this might be an injustice to the old
fellows memory as there are always
two sides to the claim of foul business
im beginning to believe the fellows on
their feet and not the fellows on the
floor

  there are too many of them doing
the dying gladiator act and when they
are so well fortified against injury it
doesnt seem possible that all of the
claims can ring true

  this is no belt at max schmeling
sharkeys blow did go low the pic-
tures are the plain evidence before the
world but just how badly was schmel-
ing hurt how are we to know ill
admit that the foul claims have got the
referees and the judges buffaloed the
minute a boxer hits the floor now
claiming foul these officials run amuck

  the cure for the evil will come i
claim it is a rest period thats my
cure and until it is tried out fouls arc
going to be claimed oftener than before
it has come to be a racket one that is
fouling boxing not the fighters

jack slacks backhand punch

many boxers in history have made use of the backhand blow including
the celebrated george lablanche who invented the pivot punch a
form of the backhand wallop to knock out the original jack dempsey then
middleweight champion of the world

   according to a recent controversy the first fighter in history to use the
backhand punch was jack slack champion of england under the london
prize ring rules from about  until about 

   slack is described as using this form of wallop by putting his two fists
against his chest and rushing at an opponent with his elbows sticking out
in front of him when he came in range he would slash out with one fist
then with the other aiming to hit his opponent with the back of his hands
slack only used this occasionally but it was recognized as the strongest
card in his system of boxing and was called his chopper it was described
as highly disconcerting to his antagonist and indeed it seems that it may
well have been

   it is a little difficult to understand how the champion could hit very hard
or accomplish very much with a punch of this description but he must have
developed the knack for he won many fights with it after other more ortho-
dox methods had failed

       by jimmy de forest

                      trainer of champions

  jimmy de forest knows every phase of the fight
game in his carcer extending over a period of
more than thirty years he has served as a match-
maker for various clubs as manager of fighters and
as a trainer and conditioner in this latter work he
is world-famous having trained champions in every
class including jim jeffries jack dempsey and
many others perhaps his most notable work was
bis preparation of jack dempsey for the willard

back in  charlie white of
chicago then a lightweight with
a reputation still to make came
east to fight ritchie mitchell in madison
square garden he asked me to second
him and act as his advisor in his corner
when i showed up for the fight the
youngster surprised his manager his
trainer his handlers and myself most
of all

  to his trainer he declared mr dc
forest will be the only man to give me
instructions in the ring tonight i wont
listen to anybody else turning to me
he added i know all about you mr
de forest if i dont do what you tell
me call me down right away and dont
spare me

  such a statement made to me in the
capacity of a trainer would have been
expected but made to a man serving on
first sight solely in the capacity of a
second it was one of the most flattering
tributes i have ever received charlie

fight when dempsey won the championship tn thi
department in fight stories he will give you the
benefit of his extensive knowledge on matters of
physical fitness he will answer your questions ad-
vise you of correct training methods exercises diets
etc young men who pride themselves  a clean
healthy body high school and college athletes men
in all walks of life in fact may turn to him in
these columns for help

white was facing a fight that was to
make or break him and was trusting a
man whom he did not know personally
to bring him through on top it meant
that charlie white had the good sense
to recognize the great importance of the
seconds work that he realized an
expert in the corner was worth almost
as much to him as his own skill and
nerve

  of course charlies statement won
me hands down i never have worked
harder for a fighter than  that night
most followers of the game will remem-
ber that battle in the first round
charlie knocked mitchell to the floor
in the second ritchie came back and
floored charlie for the next three
rounds the battle was all mitchell
charlie was cut up badly with nasty
gashes too over both eyes i between
rounds i patched up his cuts the boy
seemed to be out on his feet but he was
game

ill


fight stories

  howm i doing he gasped before
he went out for the sixth

  i lied while i worked like mad to stop
his bleeding and freshen him up keep
at him boy and well win i told him
advising him how to avoid the worst of
mitchells blows charlie was encouraged
and heeded my warnings for the next
three rounds he managed to take the
lead they see-sawed back and forth in
the ninth and tenth but mitchell was
far ahead on points i knew it was now
or never the time had arrived for a
trick

  listen charlie i told him as he
went out for the eleventh youve got
to finish this boy now if it goes twelve
rounds youll lose the decision listen
shift your punches hes looking for
your left all the time fool him use
your right this round but start out
as youve been doing so he wont
be wise to anything then shift try
a sudden hard fast right to the
jaw

  charlie obeyed mitchell fought as
he had from the start-against charlies
known style of left-hand punching
charlies right caught him completely
off guard it also caught him smack on
the jaw mitchell went down for the
count and charlie was a made-man on
a trick his second told him

  for the next ten fights i seconded
charlie white i was supposed to be
with him for the eleventh too and gave
up an offer to referee the pancho villa-
genaro fight but when i appeared at
the garden charlies manager told me
that an old friend had come on from
chicago to handle charlie and that they
couldnt use me that night so i sat and
watched the fight and saw charlie get
lckcd and licked in a fight where a
little wise ring generalship would have
saved him charlie who once floored
benny leonard and who fought a
wolgast willie ritchie johnny dun-
dee johnny kilbane and others had
started right and then stumbled the
manager was sorry-when it was too
late

charlies case illustrates the
point i want to bring home in this
article what i have to say here ap-
plies directly to ninety out of every
hundred present-day fighters an old
art of the ring is going a-begging and
fighters are paying the penalty youd
never catch a fighter of the old school
entering a ring without an expert in his
corner today there isnt one second
in five who knows his business but the
fighters dont seem to know or care

  ive been following the fight game for
forty-five years and i know something
about it my warning to every fighter
young or old is to make sure that he
has a real second to advise him from
the corner if youre a fighter dont
put your trust in any hanger-on that you
meet in the gymnasium spend the
money and get a recognized expert to
watch you then see that he gets the
authority to tell you what to do

  in the heat of battle few boxers are
able to do more than press home their
attack in their own peculiar style and
guard themselves from the attack of
their foes when gloves are dancing
back and forth in front of your eyes
its hard to appraise your opponent skill-
fully and detect hidden weaknesses a
george dixon or a young griffo might
but such super-boxers are born not
made most men in the ring have to
depend upon the observations of their
handlers in the corner

  when youre at the average fight
listen to the seconds talking to their
men

  go on boy step in youre doing
good-and more of the same fine-
sounding encouraging words unfortu-
nately they dont mean a thing itd be
a lot more to the point if the seconds
were saying something like this

  hes slow with his left and wide-
open for an uppercut if you get in close
watch his right in the clinches because
hes landing every time you break keep
that left of yours working on his eye
next round well change your punches
when we see how this stuff works out
keeping fit



  in other words the second should be
a man who is expert not only in the
matters of ring generalship but in judg-
ing the physical and fighting abilities of
both his own man and the opponent lie
must be able to out-guess the opponents
handlers and in addition to all this
should be a crack trainer a man skilled
in stopping the flow of blood from cuts
in relieving tired and sore muscles in
noting the first signs of weakness in his
fighter and in knowing the measures
to be taken to conserve his mans
strength theres no time to experiment
when a man is in the ring his handler
must instantly know what to do

  the thorough second makes it a point
to understand his own man he knows
his punches and the time it takes to de-
liver them he is able to judge accu-
rately his mans ability to take and give
punishment he can judge if his man is
in condition for a tough fight if his
legs will stand up under him if he at-
tempts much feinting or side-stepping
he knows if his man can mix up his
punches he can watch and determine
his mans most punishing blow-a left-
hand hook a straight left a right-hand
hook or body blow a right uppercut or
a left uppercut-and tell his man when
its best to deliver it he can watch
for a round or two and get a pretty
accurate idea of just how the opponent
measures up in all these respects if his
man is leg weary or arm weary he can
tell him how to stall and guard himself
it stands to reason that the man with
such a second has a big edge on the
other fellow

  in my opinion the trainer should be
the second provided he possesses the
required knowledge of ring generalship
some trainers of today although efficient
when it comes to conditioning a fighter
arent much use in the spot decisions
which must be made in the corner but
the game still has a goodly number of
gray-haired fellows who knew all the
tricks of the game before most of the
present-day fighters were born the
fighter who has such a man for his

    fight-sept-

trainer should see to it that lies in the
corner when the show-down coincs

i cant be too emphatic on the ques-
tion of handling cuts particularly
those over the eye fights arc lost con-
stantly because the handlers cant stop
the bleeding from eye gashes good
trainers know the proper solutions and
the proper nursing tricks inexpert
trainers and inexperienced seconds dont

  many seconds of today dont seem to
care what happens to their men they
arent taking the punches and they are
getting paid whether their men win or
lose wise-cracks take the place of
knowledge the inevitable result is the
ruination in two or three years of any
man who lets such second-raters serve
in his corner i dont care how good a
prospect a fighter is he cant last un-
less his ring advisers are skillful care-
ful men many youngsters punch-drunk
after a few years in the ring would be
at the top if they had followed such ad-
vice as this article contains there are
too many chiselers in the corners to-
day where once there were experts
and i know what im talking about

   a fighter should be able to last ten or
fifteen years and then quit the game
without any serious physical injury if
he has handled himself properly having
let his serious fighting wait until he first
learned how to box and protect him-
self he should be in a-l condition when
he retires there is big money in the
game today and any clever youngster
with courage and good sense can get
himself a slice of it but it takes time
and patience - plus scientific handling
both outside and at the ringside no
youngster of promise should take
chances on trainers or handlers he
should deal only with reliable expe-
rienced men such men can be found
in every sizeable city if a young man
will only look for them and not trust
too much to chance acquaintanceships
and chance meetings

  fifteen or twenty years ago every
man who stepped in the corner as a sec-


fight stories

ond was an expert trainer with purses
not nearly so much as at the present and
with men fighting on a - percent
basis the second was paid at least 
or  for his nights work if the man
won the second probably got 
there werent so many of us in the
game then and there wasnt a week that
i myself didnt second four or five
fighters but what we got we earned for
we knew our business and the fighters
knew we did

  in the first place most of the men i
seconded were men trained by myself
or by good trainers whom i knew the
fighters came to the ring properly con-
ditioned to do their best for the par-
ticular distance they were required to go
-six eight ten or fifteen rounds for
the most part they were fighters tough-
ened by far more rigorous training
methods than are employed today and
able to battle hard for fifteen rounds
and be fresh at the finish

  there were no hot-house fighters a
generation ago the men didnt have
the money for expensive camps and im-
ported chefs they trained in cold
barns and when they wanted a shower
they stood under a big can in which
holes had been punched while someone
poured in a bucket of cold water from
above rigorous treatment but it made
tough bodies men would go fifteen
twenty and twenty-five rounds and show
scarcely a mark afterwards nowadays
blood flows freely in almost every six-
round go

ighters of that older day too
knew how to box there was little
of the wild swinging which marks three-
quarters of the ring engagements of to-
day when a man let fly a punch he
knew where it was going to land thus
we had good material to work with from
the corner it was wit against wit craft
against craft on the part of the second
to them also each fight was a personal
matter every second tried to outguess
the opposing second and guided his
man every step of the way for in-

stance if an opposing fighter was using
a straight left constantly the second
was expected to tell his fighter how to
get away from it and how to attack in
turn when i saw an opponent who used
his left hand regularly id advise my
man slip his left and drive your right
hand to the heart if an opponent was
using a left-hand hook to the body i
told my man how to move so that the
hook would go harmlessly around his
body while he was getting home a short
right-hand blow to the jaw

  the seconds knew the value and mean-
ing of the counter-punch which is not
well understood today the counter is
not a defensive tactic its one of the
most effective offensive blows the game
knows you catch your opponents blow
on your arm-on the inside of his arm
of course-and before he can recover
shoot your same arm forward for his
unprotected body or jaw handled
properly its a deadly punch

  when henry persson the swedish
fighter first came to this country i
taught him the counter and he became
the greatest counter fighter i have ever
seen in the semi-final of the dempsey-
tunney match at philadelphia persson
knocked out jack adams with counter
punches he beat johnny risko with
the counter and to my mind was the
logical man to have faced tunney for
the championship

  harrys disqualification in his fight
with bud gorman always has seemed to
me a most unfortunate happening for
the ring it angered persson because he
always insisted that he had not struck
gorman a foul blow and he never would
train for his few subsequent fights he
could have licked both mccarthy in
hartford and jimmy maloney if hed
really tried

  the counter punch requires a strong
forearm to take up the shock and a
limber wrist to deliver the snap blow
many seconds of the present have only
a vague idea how it works and cant
advise their men on its use but veterans
like myself are employing it every time
keeping fit



we second a man who knows what its
all about any youngster who is trained
by a veteran knows the counter

  the authority of a good second
should never be questioned at the ring-
side either by manager or fighter nor
should advice be given to a fighter by
more than the one man in the excite-
ment of the fight a man cant listen to
two or three voices jabbering in his ear
one is plenty the second must be cool
so that he can make sure his advice gets
home in the minute of rest between the
rounds

  tom orourke taught me that lesson
as the manager of george dixon and
the handler of tom sharkey and joe
walcott and scores of other great fight-
ers of the past he proved himself one
of the greatest ringside advisers ever
known he acted as second himself and
he let me help him second dixon
sharkey walcott and others but tom
was boss at the ring and his instructions
were plain and blunt

  jimmy watch closely for any mis-
takes our man or the other fellow may
make tell me about anything you see
but keep your mouth shut when our boy
comes to the corner ill do all the talk-
ing thats to be done

  forty-five years of experience have
taught me that tom orourke was ab-
solutely right in the early days of my
training and seconding i would ask the
manager if i were to advise the tighter
at the ringside or if he intended to give
advice if the manager intended to talk
to his man i always announced that i
would not be responsible for the fight-
ers work although i would give him
what advice i could i have seen many
a fight lost by divided authority today
i will second no man unless i am in
complete charge

  the fight game has gone on it has
reached a prestige and a financial posi-
tion undreamed of a dozen years ago
but the old basic laws remain the same
the second can make or break a fighter
just as he always could and no young-
ster and no manager should take a

chance we dont want masseurs in the
corner we need trainers schooled in the
game its up to every young fighter to
see that he has such a man

correspondence

now to consider the problems of
some of our correspondents

dear mr de forest

  i have made quite a name for myself
around los angeles in fourteen fights i
have not dropped a decision but neither have
i scored a knockout to tell the honest truth
i have never staggered an opponent i have
left the ring unmarked after each battle
and of course i feel pretty good about it but
i would like to score at least one knockout
before turning pro

  both my manager and myself are at a loss
as to what to do ive punished the heavy
bag until ive been blue in the face yet when
i get into the ring against a slugger-all my
fights have been against men who are open
and easy to hit-i dance around them shoot-
ing out my left all the time drawing blood
several times but doing no real damage
when i send in my right it simply bounces
off their chins and they keep boring in for
more they dont even blink i have been told
that i have a style like tommy loughrans
and my manager has developed me along those
lines i hardly feel capable of comparing
myself with a boxer like loughran but i
cant hit either my other faults dont matter
purvear my manager and i are ironing
them out puryear defeated johnny duff in
a no-decision fight in  so you see  have
a capable manager

             ernie kid williams

  well kid you have a most impos-
ing record and your letter sounds as if
you were a sensible hard-working boy
who ought to get there with a bang
developing a punch takes time and pa-
tience first stop using the heavy bag
that has ruined scores of promising
boys it should be used only by a well-
trained heavyweight and then not too
much dempsey with all his strength
punched the heavy bag only two rounds
a day when in training take a one-half
pound weight in each hand and then
punch the light hag keep your hands
closed tightly around the weights when
shadow-boxing use the weights in each
hand also practice a left-hand hook to
the light bag using the half-pound
weight its possible that when you hit


fight stories

you arent keeping your hands tightly
closed the practice with the weight
should help a lot

dear mr de forest

  i have decided to trust to your good humor
to ask a few health questions

  	after eating i have a feeling of being
slowly crushed inside what do you sup-
pose is the cause and what do you suggest

  	what is a good system for building up
the abdominal muscles i would like to
learn to box to protect myself i am fast on
my feet but clumsy with my hands i am
eighteen years old and my measurements are
as follows neck  inches chest normal
 chest expanded j  biceps  fore-
arm  wrist  waist  hips  thigh
 calf ll ankle  height  feet 
inches weight  pounds reach  inches

                             a session
                             detroit mich

  im sorry i cant answer your first
question for you thats a matter for
the doctor and id go to him without
delay for your abdominal muscle de-
velopment lie on the floor stretch out
your hands above your head then raise
your body and bend over until your
fingers touch your toes then for a
second exercise lie stretched out on the
floor and lift your legs as high as you
can without straining try both exer-
cises three times a day

 as to your measurements your
weight is too little and your legs too
large you should weigh about 
pounds try deep breathing and out-
door activities

dear jimmy

  i would like to know if i am too young
to do any training  am sixteen years old
and i dont intend to enter the ring until i
am eighteen i have boxing equipment but
am afraid of getting heart disease

large how can i reduce them in what
class do you think i will be when im eigh-
teen and twenty-one  my measurements
height  feet  inches reach  inches
weight  pounds neck  inches biceps

expanded k hips  and waist 

                    mickey kawer
                      medford mass

  your waist mickey is o k but your
hips are large you can try bending
exercises twisting your body sideways

but first see a doctor about your heart
and do nothing he does not sanction

dear mr de forest

  for two years i have read every line of
your department keeping fit i love box-
ing and always shall but i have been away
from home for the past two years and have
not had a chance to box when school is
out this summer i am intending to do so

  i would be very thankful if you would
tell me what i might do in the way of train-
ing here my measurements are as follows
neck  inches chest normal  chest
expanded  waist  reach  forearm
 my height is  feet  inches and i
weight  pounds

  i am sixteen years old have i a chance
to become a heavyweight

               charles r womack
                   spring hill tenn

  for your size charles your weight
is light but you will build up as you get
older your chest measurement is olf
for a boy your size you can develop
this by deep breathing keep out in
the open air as much as possible but
avoid strenuous exercises until you are
older for boxing find some boy of
your own age and inexperience and
practice with him but take it easy at
the start you have grown so rapidly
that it would be a strain on your heart
to do too much

dear jimmy de forest

  i am fourteen years and six months of age
and am much interested in boxing i have
been training myself since i have been twelve
years old every summer day i go six rounds
with the light bag and one round with the
heavy bag then i do some sparring and
exercising in training i have knocked out
six playmates and have been knocked out once
i am five feet tall and weigh  pounds
how can i gain weight how can i put
more muscle on my arms could i fight 
amateur bouts when i am fifteen is it best
to do your training in the morning or at
night 

                    charley white
                          lodi n j

  charley youre one of the most am-
bitious youngsters ive heard about in
a long time not fifteen yet and plan-
ning for  fights

  i hate to check an ambitious young-
ster but i wouldnt want any boy of
your spirit to injure himself you must
stop this training of yours and wait for
keeping fit



another two years before you start such
work drop the heavy bag at once be-
cause you may ruin your hands

  you can do a little light sparring with
playmates of your own age but dont
box for more than a minute for a round
and only for two or three of such
rounds the best thing for you now is
fresh air sunshine and plenty of sleep
so that your body can develop normally
and be ready for you when the time
comes to fight

dear sir

  i am a regular reader of your magazine and
would like to ask you a few questions i am
fourteen years old and these are my measure-
ments  height  feet al inches weight 
pounds chest normal  chest expanded
 ankle li reach  inches biceps 
thigh  weight  calf  neck  are
these all right what is a good diet for a
boxer how should  start training what
hours should i sleep should i do much road
work and skipping whats good fighting
trim for a boy my age

                       frank coller
                         duncan b c

  frank id suggest that you read the
ianswer i have written to the letter im-
mediately above you are altogether too
young to be thinking of training just
take things easy until youre sixteen
and that will be plenty of time to begin
serious work and boxing

dear mr de forest

  will you be kind enough to tell me a few
exercises for the stomach chest legs and
forearm in the last few months my
stomach seems to have been getting larger
each day and i want to get to work on it
before its too late

                    jack williams
                    newport news va

  im very sorry i cant advise you
jack but i cant take the chance of sug-
gesting exercises until i know how old
you are exercises that would do for
a boy of  or  or for a grown man
couldnt be tried safely by a youngster
however you can be careful not to eat
greasy foods and pastries and outdoor
air will never hurt you

dear mr de forest

  i have a few questions i would likte to ask

  i am  feet a inches tall weigh 

pounds and am fifteen years old my other
measurements arc neck j inches fore-
arm  inches biceps j chest expanded
 wrist  inches hips  thigh 
calf  ankle  reach ivz how tall will
i be and what will i weigh when i am
twenty-one years old

  i also would like to have you suggest some
material with which i could fill a heavy bag
i did fill it with sand but when i slugged it
i nearly broke my fist

                      dave lynch

                            st johns n b

  its difficult to say how tall youll be-
come although i imagine you should be
six feet or over when you are twenty-
one your weight is light but with nor-
mal development you might become a
middleweight try deep breathing ex-
ercises each morning and get plenty of
sleep

  leave the heavy bag alone its a
wonder that you havent ruined your
hand completely youre at least a year
too young to try any training

dear jimmy 

  i have been reading and enjoying your
keeping fit articles a long time my
measurements are neck j inches wrist
 forearm l biceps  chest normal
 and expanded  wrist  thigh
 calf  ankle  i weigh  and
my height is  feet i have a reach of yz
inches and will be seventeen years old in
august are these measurements good 
how much should i weigh what routine
should i follow to improve my wind and
strength a heavy or light bag running walk-
ing or light dumbbells

  please explain the sidestep to me

                   james r schneid
                        castleton n y

  your weight and measurements are
good for your age i should judge that
you will weigh  pounds at least
when you grow up and perhaps you
may enter the heavyweight class

  i am very pleased to note your re-
quest for information on the sidestep
few of the younger fighters seem to
know much about it but its mighty
important for any man who wants to
get along in the ring feint with your
left hand as if to lead for the face step
sideways on the right foot then bring
your left foot over quickly after the
right re careful you dont get your
feet mixed up it may sound simple


fight stories

but its a tricky step that must be car-
ried out in jig time and it requires a
lot of practice

  for your wind you can do a mile
and a half to two miles a day walk
the first two hundred yards then run
two hundred yards then walk again run
again read what i have to say above
about the heavy bag

dear jimmy

  i hope you do not mind my writing to you
from over here but i am a regular reader
of your articles in the fight stories magazine
although i do not get mine until a month
after they are published i am interested in
your keeping fit and i would like your
advice i am twenty years old height 
feet  inches weight  pounds wrist 
inches chest normal  chest expanded
 reach  waist  arms  thigh


  i can hit with both fists i do plenty of
hard work which makes my hands strong
 am good at running and light on my feet
 play football twice a week and go swim-
ming regularly

  the only experience i have had is with
three army boxers i hope you will let me
know if i have a chance as a boxer i do
not think it would take me long to be able to
shape up as  am pretty useful with my fists

                     albert weston
                         london eng

  i am very glad to know that you are
able to get fight stories in england
judging by your height your measure-
ments are excellent although  imagine
ou might develop into the -pound
class youll probably grow a little
more i believe you are an athlete and
have a good chance indeed to make
yourself a boxer you are only started
you must learn a defense first of all
and get experience in amateur fights
get yourself a good trainer and you
should be set

dear mr de forest

  i am a sport fan and play a lot of football
and other sports i think i am too fat my
father says im hard i can run fifty yards
in eight seconds i am eleven years old 
feet in height weigh  my measurements

are-ankle  inches calf  inches thigh 
inches hips  inches chest normal j
expanded 

  will you please tell me in the next maga-
zine where im too big and what i should
do to make things normal do you advise
my losing weight

  well johnny your letter gives me a
lot of pleasure i like to see a boy take
an interest in his condition and in sports
i dont think youve got anything to
worry about your measurements are
fine although youre a little heavy around
the waistline the waistline should be
around  to be about perfect for a boy
your age i should say youre a husky
youngster in good health but if you
want to cut down on the waist a little
you can try the floor exercise lie down
on your back and raise each foot five
times but you must be very careful
not to do any more than that at
eleven you can injure your kidneys
very easily by any over-strain youre
too young to put any strain on your
heart and you mustnt do the exercise
any more than once in the morning and
once at night if you dont feel tired
when youre getting ready for bed you
can also try a deep breathing exercise
for your chest morning and night

  s t farrell jr richmond va

i	think you ought to be a heavyweight
in three or four years judging from
your build at the present time exercise
the left hand punch the bag with it
and use it that is the way to develop it
arent you a little young to join the
navy you might inquire at a recruit-
ing station

  johnny murphy kankakee 
you can develop your punch by using
the heavy bag your measurements
are o k but your legs seem a bit thin
road work will develop them

         this is how fight stories sees it reflections
         opinions predictions-based on a close contact with
         the ring game and a front-row view of fighters in action

at the garden
one night not
long ago i was
talking with a boxer

when i use the word
boxer i do so with-
out fear of contradic-
tion his name is jack
britton this is his
ring name forty-five
years ago he was
christened william j

breslin almost half a century and
jack is still decisioning lads who could
be his own sons

  twenty-five years of glove-slinging
and ducking and still able to give box-
ing lessons to ambitious youths who
were probably unborn when he made
his first ring appearance he has boxed
in practically every town in the country
and he has met them all

  jack is really a marvel a couple of
curls in his ears but not another mark
to show for the hundreds of gloves that
have been fired at him by such warriors
as ted kid lewis benny leonard
jimmy duffy leach cross mike
odowd packey mcfarland mike
glover kid broad willie ritchie not
forgetting the rough tough lad who de-
throned him back in -mickey
w alker

  strange as it may seem we were not
talking about fouls i was trying to
get jack to talk about himself but
he is a hard nut to crack jack be-
lieves in talking with his wits and his
gloves inside the ropes i did how-
ever get him to unload a chestful of
wisdom that a lot of ringsters might
well inhale the talk naturally reached
the present crop of welters jimmy mc-
larnin especially

     mclarnin is one of the old
  school said britton theres a
  boy who will be a champ one o

these days watch
him hes one of the
few in the ring to-
day that knows how
to feint most of
them are just slam-
bang kids that dont
know what a left
hand is for

   jack should know

he can still plaster
plenty of them he
says it is simply be-
cause the average
fighter of today
thinks that all he
has to do is get in there and whale
away until he either drops his foe
with a lucky punch or gets dropped
himself they dont stop to study
boxing or the game they are entering

   he calls it a trade and he is right

   in any other field of endeavor de-
clares britton a fellow goes through
a long preparatory course he studies
the groundwork of the business hes en-
tering in mechanical fields he has to
serve a long tiresome apprenticeship
if you want to be a plumber or an elec-
trician or a machinist youve got to
be an apprentice first

  half of these boys britton says
dont understand the first thing about
footwork they dont know that they
have a left hand to pave the way for
the right very few of them know how
to hook and even fewer know how to
follow the left jab with their right
glove

     britton points to himself in proof
   of this statement he is not and
   never was a knockerout but at forty-
   five he can jab his way to victory
   over many a boy who packs more
   punch than britton ever had the
   experience gained in twenty-five
   years of glove-duelling has of course
   brought jack to a point where prac-
   tically his every move inside the
   ropes is almost subconscious in-
   stinctive possibly mechanical but it
   all came from study of his trade
   as he calls it

  jimmy mclarnin whom jack is
watching with keen interest is going


	fight

about his quest of the crown britton
wore in much the same manner as did
jack years ago jimmy is a student of
his trade fans who claim that mc-
larnin is lucky and gets all the breaks
overlook this feature of the coast irish-
mans fighting equipment he is a
scholar of sockology look back over
his record to date

  what does it show that proves jimmy
is a student of his trade it smacks
you right on the chin with the indis-
putable black-and-white he studies
liis opponent marks his every weak-
ness and his greatest strength then
he goes back for his second meeting
armed with a mental notebook that
shows him the holes in his foes arma-
ment as neatly as if he had a chart tacked
on his corner post

  this instinct of mclarnins coupled
with his natural punching power is
bound to end with the welter crown
firmly perched on jimmys head pro-
vided of course he does not continue
to grow

     in a return bout with young jack
   thompson i am inclined to pick
   mclarnin simply on this basis
   when he fought the negro in new
   york i was among the few who be-
   lieved thompson should have had
   the decision but when one con-
   siders that jimmy went the distance
   against a classy fighting machine
   like thompson and did it with only
   one hand it is to be expected that
   with two good fists the baby-faced
   irishman will likely page thompson
   before they go far along the route

   at this time the strongest opposition
facing mclarnin is not young jack
thompson neither is it jackie fields
the former champion or young cor-
bett the coast southpaw corbett
being a left-hander can offer plenty of
trouble for any of the orthodox top-
notchers but it is the boston bean-eater
johnny indrisano who may furnish the
fireworks in mclarnins title parade

  indrisano who was once a beantown
caddy and today can hold his own on
the links with a lot of birdie-shooters
is a natural welter if it conies to a

stories

match between mclarnin and indrisano

the fans are going to see more gloves
whizzing than they have seen in many
a day

  boston johnny is a sharpshooter and
he lias the proverbial lightning slowed
down to a walk he cant hit like mc-
larnin but he can spear points faster
than anything in his weight since brit-
tons time

    mclarnin proved that he was a
  student of the ring when he de-
  veloped his natural punching power

  he was quick to realize that the
  fans want to see knockouts pri-
  marily a clever two-handed boxer
  jimmy began immediately to put
  the crusher into his blows it was
  this studious combination of clever-
  ness and knockdown punching that
  has brought him to the forefront of
  the welters today as jack britton
  says watch his left hand open up
  his man for the right and watch
  him feint his foe into a lead that
  will put him in a position where
  jimmys right can measure him

  he outsmarts them says the old
former champion

  and thats just what baby-face does
if he cant whip them the first time out
he catalogues his man for the next time

  you wont find jimmy mclarnin
says britton walking on his heels ten
years from now he wont be looking
around for a hand-out and neither
am i its a trade just like engineering
or brick-laying you study it from the
ground up and learn all the tricks and
short-cuts you dont hear me talkin
to myself do you  thats what hap-
pens to the boys that just bust into the
ring with a pair of gloves and a lot of
heart they want to be champs and
get rich but they dont know what its
all about

  nobody can deny the truth of brit-
tons remarks and jack is certainly not
punch-drunk by any stretch of the
imagination what he told me and
what i am repeating to you is all too
true a few more ringmen like jimmy
mclarnin who study their trade and
we wouldnt have to read pages of argu-
ments about fouls bill cook

  the neutral corner is tho meeting place for all

strange how history repeats itself a battle is fought a great event
happens a great man is born and dies that seems to be the end of it but
nothing is as simple as it seems in the workshop of human destiny nothing
is lost nothing disappears forever a generation or two later-or maybe a couple
of hundred years or a thousand or so-the same sequence turns up a similar
battle is fought similar events occur a great man is born with form and fea-
tures similar to those of a forerunner and more remarkable still as his career
unrolls it is seen to resemble detail by detail the life of his predecessor who lived
fifty or a hundred or a thousand years ago

  historians tell us that our own
george washington was a dead ringer
for cincinnatus the general of old
rome who lived long before the chris-
tian era they say that the busts of
the roman and statues of our own first
president are so much alike that they
could not be told apart if it were not
for the difference in costume cin-
cinnatus like washington liberated his
land from a foreign foe he fought his
battles of trenton and yorktown and
like washington refused to be made
king by a grateful people and returned
to end his life as a country gentleman

  and so it goes in the great world
the little world of the ring however is
just as full of repetitions and coincid-
ences new champions appear who are
the image of battlers departed scores of
years ago dozens of sport writers pro-
claimed the scowling black-browed
dempsey another john l sullivan
now it is schmeling who is another

dempsey tunney was called a second
corbett and corbett himself was said
by english ring authorities to be a
ringer for gentleman john jackson who
plied his trade in the bare-knuckle days
a hundred years back

  all of which reminiscing histor-
ical and otherwise was started by a let-
ter received from mr william m
brainard of louisville kentucky rela-
tive to a feat performed by ruby robert
fitzsimmons

  evidently mr brainard is one of the
dyed-in-the-wool fitzsimmons fans so
are a lot more of us after telling about
the greatness of fitz describing his
devastating wallop and his matchless
workmanship in landing that wallop
mr brainard states that if fitz had
possessed solider hands he would have
been champion of the world -for life
of course this is covering a lot of terri-
tory but here is what mr brainard
has to say




fight stories

  fitz was the greatest puncher and the great-
est thinker of any age in the prize ring even
with a pair of busted mitts he nearly mur-
dered big jim jeffries the toughest heavy-
weight of all time after his second fight
with ruby robert big jim was the worst-
punished boxer who ever stood in a ring
his right eye was cut completely around by
fitzs terrible left and his left eye was gashed
top and bottom and swollen shut his nose
was beaten down level and it took more than
eighty stitches to make even a partial job of
repair

  old bobs hands gave way in the second
round but he kept right on hitting with them
anyway he could feel the bones rattling
around in his fists like ice in a water pitcher
but he kept on jamming in the punches never-
the less

  in the sixth he had big jeff dazed and
staggering fitz often said he felt sure that
if he could have had either hand whole and
solid for thirty seconds at that time he would
have emerged champion of the world after
the fight jeff the winner looked as though
he had been run through a sausage machine
while there wasnt a mark on fitz aside from
his mitts which were done up in splints

  then take his fight with george gardiner
this was the greatest feat of gameness a
fighting man ever pulled off gardiner was
a big strong tough clever fellow he could
have licked nine-tenths of the heavyweights
of today fitz was about forty-five years
old when he took him on and his hands were
always like chinaware after his fight with
jeffries in the very first round he slammed
his terrible left for the body and shoved it
into gardiners elbow pop  went a couple
of bones still the freckled marvel fought
on and was making a chopping block of
gardiner when along toward the middle of
the fight he thought he had him feinted into
just the proper position for a knockout the
old right mitt whizzed through the air for
gardiners jaw by a frantic wiggle the bos-
ton fighter just managed to pull down his
head enough so that the punch landed on the
top of his dome instead of his chin down
went gardiner just the same if his concrete
work hadnt been a foot thick and well re-
inforced he would have been out cold as it
was he managed to scramble to his feet
before the count of ten and gradually his
strength came back

  with fitz the case was different that
mighty wallop had busted his one good hand
which made it rather awkward for bob to
be left in the ring with a husky young near-
champion without a solid bone in either mitt

  fitz was nothing if not a man of courage
and resource however he didnt tell any-
body how badly his hands were hurt all
through the rest of the fight he kept aiming
terrific punches at gardiner which just barely
missed their mark george had sampled those
punches and he had no desire to run into
any more of them so by dint of swinging
and missing and occasionally poking in a
punch on some soft spot fitz carried on to
the end of the battle gaining the referees

decision by a piece of bluffing unmatched in
ring history

  so much for mr brainard which
brings us back to our beginning as to
history repeating itself that was a
great battle fitz fought against george
gardiner and a great feat of cunning
and gameness it wasnt so long ago
however that something very similar
was pulled and in a championship battle
the hero of the incident was bat bat-
talino and the occasion was his feather-
weight championship contest with an-
dre routis early in the battle bat
smashed his left hand his best mitt on
the frenchmans head which left him
handicapped he had landed a couple
of healthy lefts on the frenchman how-
ever and implanted a mighty respect in
the others brain for that wing so all
through the rest of the fight he kept on
swinging with it just as fitz had done
before him taking care to miss by a
fractional margin each time by the
aid of this maneuvre and a lot of healthy
activity with the right he got away with
the battle

  and that is not all it was necessary
to operate to straighten out the bones
of the hand and the wound become in-
fected bats hand was a terrible sight
before winning the title he had signed
up to fight lew massey in philadelphia
and bat is one of those fighters who
makes it his boast never to break an
engagement in spite of the terrible
condition of his mitt he went over to
the city of brotherly love where he
put up a hurricane battle against mas-
sey after the bout he fainted and
when they looked at the condition of
his hand they knew why

  the chairman of the pennsylvania
athletic committee censured the physi-
cian who had pronounced bat fit to
fight be that as it may bat had made
his fight and won under the same con-
ditions and under the same handicap
that hampered ruby robert fitzsim-
mons twenty-five years before and his-
tory had pulled another of its famous
repeats

bare-knuckle days

an odd figure in the annals of the
ring of the old bare-knuckle days
was tom cannon the great gun of
windsor heavyweight champion of
england from  to  beside
being a first-class man with his fists
tom had other accomplishments which
lent color to his character he was
one of the best foot-racers in england
and claimed the sprinting championship

e

tom cannon the great gun of wind-
sor pugilist sprinter wrestler
billiard player

of the british isles he was also a pro-
fessional wrestler a billiard player of
no mean ability and sang a mean tenor
in the barber-shop quartettes of his day

   not the least of the unusual features
in toms history is the fact that he won
his championship at an age when most
men are has-beens he was born at
eton england in  and won his
way to the top of the heavyweight heap
in  at which time he was thirty-
five years old losing it three years later
at the age of thirty-eight

  like many other champions of the
british prize ring cannon worked as a
waterman or bargee in his early
days he rowed a punt on the river
thames for hire graduating from this
occupation to the ring he was about
five feet ten inches tall weighed about
a hundred and eighty pounds and was
unusually active and versatile

  alter spending the best years of his
youth fighting second-raters without
attaining to any particular emminence
tom was matched at the age of thirty-
five to fight josh hudson celebrated as
the great john bull fighter josh
was regarded as by all odds the leading
candidate for the heavyweight cham-
pionship in taking on cannon he ex-
pected to get only an exercise bout he
got the exercise-and how

  after seventeen rounds of desperate
fighting josh took the final count
cannon was proclaimed the champion
and was immediately challenged by josh
for a return match which was fought
with the same result

  after two and a half years at the top
of the heap the great gun lost his
title to jem ward in a terrific ten-round
battle

he knew the old boys

editor fight stories

  as i am an enthusiastic reader of your
magazine i take great interest in reading
about the battles had by the old-time fight-
ers i myself am an old man now john l
sullivan was one year my senior i know
john l and jake kilrain well i felt a
little sorry for jake when he fought john
l yet i was glad sullivan won as i had my
last peso bet on him as i said i am one
of a past age i remember such old boys
as john c heenan bill poole joe coburn
mike mccoole paddy ryan john mor-
rissey joe goss tom king tom sayers
charley smith peter jackson and others of
the old style london prize ring fighters
these old-timers were square-shooters very
seldom would they resort to fouling an op-
ponent when they saw the other man was
too good for them

  there is one name which i presume is for-
gotten-that of dan donnelly who fought
cooper the champion of england at kildare
ireland in the year  this was one of
the hardest contested fights ever held in great
britain eleven rounds donnelly knocked


fight stories

cooper down nine times and broke his jaw-
bone now should you have a record of
this battle i should like to see it also of
sayers and heenan

these old battles were fast and furious
i know from experience how it felt when
one received a jolt on the proboscis delivered
by a man who weighed  or  pounds
with bare knuckles and when the gong did
not ring every three minutes at that time
the saying was common til put a tin ear
on you and it usually was put on

a word from joe choynski

editor fight stories

being an old-timer myself i read with
great interest the articles of old timer as
they appear in your magazine

the greatest fight card that was ever ar-
ranged i think was the beef trust show
that appeared in the old garden a few years
back when jess willard met luther mc-
carty this was the fastest heavyweight
bout i ever witnessed and i would like it if
you would touch upon it some time

            william h trantham

                        washington d c

perhaps he could

dear sir

i have been reading fight stories magazine
for a long time and find that it is the best
reading bar none  only wish you would
issue two copies per month

i agree with mr jack murphy of van-
cover wash that the bat nelson and jack
dempsey the nonpareil life stories were
knock-outs but i disagree with him when
he says the dempsey of today could not whip
bob fitzsimmons when both were in their
prime

questions and answers

editor fight stories 

congratulations on your magazine i have
read almost all the issues tell kid bevan
that i think he is a poor judge of fighters

t surely enjoyed the life story of mickey
walker why not have something about
jim maloney and johnny risko

can you answer a question for me do
you think dempsey could lick schmeling
hope you will print this letter

                 warren richardson
                       hillsboro n it

just at present most fans-and most
fistic experts-would pick dempsey to
beat the german dempsey is a harder

hitter and faster though his legs cer-
tainly are not the legs of the old
dempsey however it is difficult to
predict how a fighter may develop and
schmeling is strong rugged and a
puncher his heart is also in the right
place and the faster the going the bet-
ter he seems to like it he is big
enough and tough enough to give any-
body a fight and has plenty of dynamite
in either hand

  it is a little too early to say what his
place will be in the annals of the ring
when the records are finally closed and
the last votes are counted maybe he
will be rated as a world-beater or may-
be he will go down in annals as a dub
just at present he is more or less of
an enigma his next couple of fights
will tell the tale

editor neutral corner

  what was john c heenans real name and
why was he called the benecia boy was
he ever champion of the world what was
kid williams real name and was he an
american citizen

frederick g best

st paul minn

  john c heenan was the real name of
one of americas early heroes of the
bare-knuckle school of boxing heenan
never had a ring title and never wrent
by any other name except his own he
was born in new york state but at
an early age moved to california where
his family settled in benecia-hence
his title of benecia boy

  heenan entered the employ of the
pacific mail steamship company at
benecia as a boiler-maker and machin-
ist he was a man more than six feet
two inches tall weighed over two hun-
dred pounds and was famous for his
speed and agility he forged rapidly
to the front when he took up bare-
knuckle fighting cleaned up in cali-
fornia and then came east for more
worlds to conquer

he was never a champion of the
world though he fought tom sayers
the neutral corner



champion of england for that title in
a desperate battle which was pro-
nounced a draw heenans friends
claimed that he was robbed

  kid williams real name was john
gutenko he was born in copenhagen
denmark but his parents came to this
country when the kid was very young
and williams grew up here the kid
automatically became a citizen of this
country when his father was natur-
alized

neutral corner

  i would like to know who among the fol-
lowing was the best heavyweight champion
-dempsey fitzsimmons jeffries or tun-
ney was corbett ever champion of the
world 

  which of the lot of the champions above
was most popular with the fans

                        clopton west
                        houston texas

  questions like this never can be set-
tled with any degree of finality in any
gathering of fans you would find plenty
of rooters for each of your candidates
probably most of the present-day fans
would vote in favor of dempsey as the
best of the lot but plenty of the old-
timers would uphold the claims of fitz
and jeffries tunney also would find
plenty of supporters on the grounds of
his strength ring generalship and box-
ing skill far be it from us to pro-
nounce final judgment on such a matter

  yes jim corbett was champion of
the world he won his championship
from john l sullivan in their fight in
new orleans and later nailed it down
by beating charley mitchell the
champion of england

  your question as to which of those
fighters was most popular with the fans
is another that is difficult to answer
each champion who wins and holds his
title with decisive victories is invested
with great popularity as a rule a
champion in his day is acclaimed the
greatest of all champions and is the
most popular of all fighters but just
which one of the lot was really the most
popular is a matter of pure speculation

 three weeks after i met ann wo were engaged it was
 when we began talking about rents and furniture and such
 things that i woke up

when he speaks they jiimp

command and did you see how quickly
it was obeyed you dont have to ask why

waist get the swiit ready poise of those legs-the
quick vibrant power of those wrists heres a man you

a human dynamo health strength speed clear think-
ing are his hes a leader in everything he does

in just  months he did it

  he wasnt born with that superb body only  short
months ago he was about as pitiful a specimen of man-
hood as ever walked the earth he couldnt lift a
feather and at the end of the day he was almost too
tired to drag himself home the men in his office used
to laugh at his poor attempts to keep pace with them
but he learned the secret of scientific muscle-building
-of gaining tremendous strength in a hurry-and look
at him now hes just one of the  men i have
rebuilt in the last  years

you can be like him

  folks call me the muscle-builder for years ive
been taking weak worn-out men from all over the
world and making them into forceful aggressive leaders

dred thousand of them have been turned out of my
muscle factory with new health and strength to fight

is minutes a day is all i ask

  my system is simple and easy but it certainly gets
results just is minutes with me each day and youll
begin to notice the difference in a week and in just
 days i guarantee to put one whole inch of real
muscle on each ol your arms and two full inches across
your chest remember i guarantee it not just promise
it if you follow directions that muscle is bound to
be there

  but that isnt all i do in  days your neck will
begin to broaden-your legs grow shapely and strong
inside and out youll feel and act like a new mn
your eyes will regain that sparkle a healthy happy
boy has youll find it easier to think and think clearly
