   m runic hero h was just an ordinary worker
   i for a time when things were slack i even
 thought that we might have to li t him bo
   then gradually i noticed an improvement in
 his work me seemed to really
 understand what lie was doing
   one day he came into my office
 anil salil lie hail worked out a new
 arm for the automatic feeder i
 was a little skeptical at first but
 when he started explaining to me
 j could see that he had really dis-
 covered somethin and when i
 started questioning him  was
 amazed he certainly did know
 what he was talking about
   so we sat down and talked for
 over an hour finally i asked him
 where he had learned so much
 about his work he smiled and
 took a little book from his pocket
    theres no secret about it ho
 said the answers right here
 four months ago i saw one of
 those advertisements of the inter-
 national correspondence schools
  hail been seeing them for years

 i ever made-i knew it the minute  started my

the coming of the light
the first of the pew meteors landed
on the earth in november 
it was discovered by a farmer in his
field near brookline massachusetts short-
ly after daybreak on the morning of the
nth astronomically the event was re-
corded by the observatory at harvard as
the sudden appearance of what apparently
was a new star increasing in the short space
 a		
 of a few hours from invisibility to a power
 beyond that of the first magnitude and
 then as rapidly fading again to invisibility
 this star was recorded by two of the other
 great north american observatories and
 by one in the argentine republic that
 it was comparatively small in mass and
 exceedingly close to the earth even when
 first discovered was obvious all observ-
 ers agreed that it was a heavenly body of
 an entirely new order
   the observatory at harvard supplement-

argosy-allstory weekly
ed its account by recording the falling just
before dawn of the nth of an extraordi-
narily brilliant meteor thatflamed with a
curious red and green light as it entered the
earths atmosphere this meteor did not
burn itself out but fell still retaining its
luminosity from a point near the zenith to
the horizon
  what the farmer saw was a huge fire
burning near the center of his field it
was circular in form and about thirty feet
in diameter he was astonished to see it
there but what surprised him more was its
peculiar aspect
  it was still the twilight of dawn when
he reached the field he beheld the fire
first from a point several hundred yards
away as he explained it the light-for
it was more aptly described as a light than
a fire-extended in parallel rays from the
ground directly upward into the sky he
could see no line of demarkation where it
ended at the top it seemed to extend into
the sky an infinite distance it was in
fact as though an enormous searchlight
were buried in his field casting its beam of
light directly upward
  but more than all this the farmer was
struck by the extraordinary color of the
light at the base it was a deep solid
green this green color extended upward
for perhaps fifty feet then it shaded into
red the farmer noticed too that the fire
did not leap and dance with flames but
seemed rather to glow-a steady light like
the burning of colored powder in the
morning half-light it threw a weird un-
earthly reddish-green glow over the field
  the farmer approached to within twenty
feet of the light he looked to see what was
burning but could not determine for the
greenish base extended directly down into
the ground he noticed also that it gave
out extraordinarily little heat the morn-
ing was not exceptionally cold yet he stood
within twenty feet of the fire without dis-
comfort
   i was on the staff of the boston observer
at this time i reached brookline about
noon of the nth of november and went
directly to the field where the fire was
burning nearly a thousand people were
there watching
   by daylight the fire still held its green
and red color although its light was much
less intense it held its characteristic shape
though clearly definable under the rays of
the sun it became quite transparent look-
ing through it i could see plainly the crowd
of people on the farther side of the field
the effect was similar to looking through
a faintly tinted glass except that now i
noticed that the light had a sort of crawl-
ing motion like the particles of a heavy
fog the fire came from a hole in the
ground by daylight now the hole could be
seen plainly
  for some moments i stood silent awe-
struck by this extraordinary spectacle
then a man standing beside me remarked
that there was no smoke i had not thought
of that before but it was true-indeed the
fire appeared phosphorescent
    lets get up closer said the man be-
side me
  together we walked to within ten feet
of the outer edge of the fire we could
feel its heat now although it was not un-
comfortable except when it beat directly
on our faces standing so close we could
see down into the hole from which the light
emanated
   lying at the bottom of the hole perhaps
ten feet below the surface i saw the jagged
top of an enormous gray sphere burned
and pitted this was the meteor-nearly
thirty feet in diameter-that in its fall
had buried itself deep in the loam of the
field
  as we stood there looking down into the
hole some one across from us tossed in a
ball of paper it seemed to hang poised
a moment then it shriveled up turned
black and floated slowly down until it
rested on top of the sphere
  some one else threw a block of wood
about a foot long into the hole i could
see it as it struck the top of the sphere
it lay there an instant then it too turned
black and charred but it did not burst into
flame
  the man beside me plucked at my sleeve
 why dont it burn he asked
   i shook myself loose
   how should i know i answered im-
patiently
the fire people

  i found myself trembling all over with
an unreasoning fear for there was some-
thing uncanny about the whole affair i
went back to brookline soon after that to
send in the story and do some telephoning
when i got back to the field i saw a man
in front of me carrying a pail of water i
fell into step beside him
   what do you suppose it  do he
asked as we walked along
   god knows i answered  try it
  but when we got down into the field we
found the police authorities in charge the
crowd was held back now in a circle a
hundred yards away from the light after
some argument we got past the officials
and followed by two camera men and a
motion-picture man who bobbed up from
nowhere walked out across the cleared
space toward the light we stopped about
six or eight feet from the edge of the hole
the heat was uncomfortably intense
    ill make a dash for it said the man
with the pail
   he ran forward a few steps splashed the
water into the light and hastily retreated
as the water struck the edge of the light
there came a roar like steam escaping un-
der tremendous pressure a great cloud of
vapor rolled back over us and dissolved
when the air cleared i saw that the light
or the fire of this mysterious agency was
unchanged the water dashed against it
had had absolutely no effect
   it was just after this incident that the
first real tragedy happened one of the
many auadruplanes that had been circling
over the fielduring the afternoon passed
directly over the light at an altitude of per-
haps three thousand feet we saw it sail
away erratically as though its pilot no
longer had it under control then it sud-
denly burst into flame and came quiver-
ing down in a long lengthening spiral of
smoke
  that night the second of the meteors
landed on the earth it fell near juneau
alaska and was accompanied by the same
phenomena as the one we were watching
the reports showed it to be slightly smaller
in size than the brookline meteor it
burned brightly during the day of novem-
ber  on the morning of the th wire-
less reports from alaska stated that it had
burned out during the previous night
  meanwhile the light at brookline was
under constant surveillance it remained
unchanged in all respects
  the next night it rained-a heavy pelt-
ing downpour for a mile or more around
the field the hissing of steam could be heard
as the rain struck the light the next morn-
ing was clear and still we saw no change in
the light
   then a week later came the cold spell
of  surpassing in severity the winters
of  and  it broke all existing rec-
ords of the weather bureau the tem-
perature during the night of november 
at brookline fell to thirty degrees below
zero during this night the fire was seen
to dwindle gradually in size and by morning
it was entirely extinguished
  no other meteors fell that winter and
as their significance remained unexplained
public interest in them soon died out the
observatories at harvard flagstaff cordo-
ba and the newer one on table mountain
near cape town all reported the appear-
ance of several new stars flaring into promi-
nence for a few hours and visible just
after sunset and before dawn on several
nights during november but these pub-
lished statements were casually received
and aroused only slight general comment
  then in february  came the publi-
cation of professor newlands famous the-
ory of the mercutian light-as the fire was
afterward known professor newland was
at this time the foremost astronomer in
america and his extraordinary theory and
the predictions he made coming from so
authoritative a source amazed and startled
the world
   his paper couched in the language of sci-
ence was rewritten to the public under-
standing and published in the newspapers of
nearly every country it was an exhaustive
scientific deduction explaining in theory
the origin of the two meteors that had fallen
to earth two months before
  in effect professor newland declared that
the curious astronomical phenomena of the
previous november-the new  stars  ob-
served the two meteors that had fallen with
their red and green light-fire-were all evi-

argosy-allstory weekly
dence of the existence of intelligent life on
the planet mercury
 i give you here only the more important
parts of the paper as it was rewritten for the
public prints
    i am therefore strongly inclined to
 accept the theory advanced by schiaparelli in
  in which he concluded that mercury
 rotates on its axis once in eighty-eight days
 now since the sidereal revolution of mer-
 cury t e its complete revolution around the
 sun occupies only slightly under eighty-eight
 days the planet always presents the same face
 to the sun on that side reigns perpetual
 day on the other-the side presented to the
 earth as mercury passes us-perpetual night
   the existence of an atmospheric envelope
 on mercury to temper the extremes of heat
 and cold that would otherwise exist on its
 light and dark hemispheres seems fairly cer-
 tain if there were no atmosphere on the
 planet temperatures on that face toward the
 sun would be extraordinarily high-many hun-
 dred degrees hotter than the boiling point of
 water
   quite the other extreme would be the con-
 ditions on the dark side for without the shel-
 tering blanket of an atmosphere this surface
 must be exposed to the intense cold of inter-
 planetary space
   i have reason to believe however par-
 ticularly from my deductions made in con-
 nection with the photographs taken during the
 transit of mercury over the face of the sun
 on november  last that there does exist an
 atmosphere on this planet-an atmosphere
 that appears to be denser and more cloudy
 than our own i am led to this conclusion
 by other evidence that has long been fairly
 generally accepted as fact the terminating
 edge of the phases of mercury is not sharp
 but diffuse and shaded-there is here an at-
 mospheric penumbra the spectroscope also
 shows lines of absorption which proves that
 mercury has a gaseous envelope thicker than
 ours
   this atmosphere whatever may be its
 nature i do not assume tempers the heat and
 cold on mercury to a degree comparable to
 the earth but i do believe that it makes the
 planet-on its dark face particularly-capable
 of supporting intelligent life of some form
    mercury was in transit over the face of the
 sun on november  of last year within a
 few hours of the time the first meteor fell to
 earth the planet was therefore at one of her
 closest points to the earth and-this is signifi-
 cant-was presenting her dark face toward us
   at this time several new stars were re-
 ported flashing into brilliancy and then fad-
 ing again into obscurity all were observed
 in the vicinity of mercury none appeared
 elsewhere i believe these so-called stars
 to be some form of interplanetary vehicle-
 probably navigated in space by beings from
 mercury and from them were launched the
 two meteors that struck our planet how
 many others were dispatched that may have
 missed their mark we have no means of de-
 termining
    the days around november  last owing
  to the proximity of mercury to the earth were
  most favorable for such a bombardment a
  similar time is now once more almost upon
  us
    because of the difference in the velocities
  of mercury and the earth in their revolutions
  around the sun one synodic revolution of
  mercury i e from one inferior conjunction
  to the next requires nearly one hundred and
  sixteen days in eighty-eight days mercury
  has completed her sidereal revolution but dur-
  ing that time the earth has moved ahead a
  distance requiring twenty-eight days more be-
  fore she can be overtaken
    after the first week in march of this year
  therefore mercury will again be approaching
  inferior conjunction and again will pass at
  her closest point to the earth
    we may expect at this time another bom-
  bardment of a severity that may cause tre-
  mendous destruction or destroy entirely life
  on this planet
chapter ii
the unknown enemy
when in february  professor
james nevvland issued this remark-
able statement my paper sent me
at once to interview him he was at this
time at the head of the harvard observatory
staff he lived with his son and daughter
in cambridge his wife was dead i had
been acquainted with the professor and his
family for some time i first met his son
alan during our university days at har-
vard we liked each other at once and be-
came firm friends-possibly because we
were such opposite physical types as some-
times happens
 alan was tall lean and muscular-an
inch or so over six feet-with the perfect
build of an athlete i am dark alan was
blond with short curly hair and blue eyes
his features were strong and regular he
was in fact one of the handsomest men i
have ever seen and yet he acted as though
he didnt know it-or if he did as though
he considered it a handicap i think what
the fire people

saved him was his ingenious ready smile
and his retiring unassuming-almost diffi-
dent-manner
  at the time of the events i am describing
alan was twenty-two-about two years
younger than i it was his first year out
of college he had taken a scientific course
and intended to join his fathers staff
  beth and alan were twins i was tre-
mendously interested in beth even then
she seemed one of the most worth-while
girls i had ever met she was a little wisp
of femininity slender and delicate hardly
more than five feet one or two she had
beautiful golden hair and an animated pret-
ty face with a pert little snub nose she
was a graduate of vassar and planned to
take up chemistry as a profession for she
had the same scientific bent as her father
and brother
  i called upon professor newland the eve-
ning of the day his statement was pub-
lished and found all three discussing it
   you want me to talk for publication
dont you bob trevor the professor
asked suddenly after we had exchanged a
few pleasantries
  he was a wiry little man about sixty
smooth-shaven with sparse gray hair a
rugged face of strong character and a rest-
less air of energy about him he was an
indefatigable worker indeed i am confi-
dent that for any single continuous period
of work without sleep he could have run
alan and me into the ground and still have
been comparatively fresh
   you want an exclusive follow-up story
from me to-night dont you he repeated
i admitted that i did
   what youll get wont be just what
you expect look at this
  he pulled one of the evening papers to-
ward him vigorously  they think it is
humorous there-read that
  the item to which he pointed was a
sprightly account of the weird beings that
might shortly arrive from mercury
   they think its a joke-some of them
theres another-read that
  the attitude of the press was distinctly
an inclination to treat the affair from the
humorous side i had seen indications of
that during the day at the office
   look here bob -the professor swept
all the papers aside with his hand  you
put it to them this way make them see
this is not a prediction of the end of the
world weve had those before-nobody
pays any attention to them and rightly so
but this mercutian light is more than a
theory-its a fact we fought it last no-
vember and well have to fight it again
next month thats what i want to make
them realize
   theyll think it is worth being serious
about alan put in  if one of those lights
drop into boston or new york-especially
if it happens to play in a horizontal direc-
tion instead of vertical
  we went into the whole subject thor-
oughly and the professor gave me a second
signed statement in which he called upon
the nations of the world to prepare for the
coming peril
  the actual characteristics of the mercu-
tian light we had discussed before several
times a good deal had been printed about
it during the previous december-without
as i have said attracting much public at-
tention the two meteors had been ex-
amined they were found to be of a min-
eral that could have originated on mercury
they were burned and pitted like other me-
teorites by their passage through the earths
atmosphere
  of the light itself professor newland had
already given his opinion it was he said
some unknown form of etheric vibration
it radiated heat very slightly but it had
the peculiarity of generating intense heat in
anything it touched directly
   youd better explain that father said
beth when we reached this point in our
summary that evening
   heat is the vibration of molecules of
matter the professor began
  i nodded
   make it clear when you write it up
bob alan put in  its like this all
molecules are in motion-the faster the mo-
tion the hotter the substance and vice
versa
   and this mercutian light beth add-
ed  has the power of enormously increas-
ing the molecular vibration of anything it
comes in contact with-

argosy-allstory weekly
   but it doesnt radiate much heat itself
alan finished
  professor newland smiled  the old
man doesnt have much of a show does
he
  alan sat down somewhat abashed but
beth remained standing beside her father
listening intently to everything he said
   this light i conceive to be the chief
weapon of warfare of the mercutians the
professor went on  there has been some
talk of those two meteors being signals
thats all nonsense they were not sig-
nals-they were missiles it was an act of
aggression
  i tried to get him to give some idea of
what the inhabitants of mercury might be
like for that was what my editor chiefly
desired
  at first he would say nothing along those
lines
   that is pure speculation he explained
 and very easy speculation too any one
can allow his imagination to run wild and
picture strange beings of another world i
dont predict they will actually land on the
earth-and i have no idea what they will
look like if they do land as a matter of
fact they will probably look very much like
ourselves i see no reason to doubt it
   like us i ejaculated
   why not said alan  conditions on
mercury are not fundamentally different
from here we dont have to conceive any
very extraordinary sort of being to fill
them
   heres what you can tell your paper
said the professor abruptly  take it
down
  i took out my notebook and he dictated
briskly
   regarding the possible characteristics
of inhabitants of mercury it is my concep-
tion that intelligent life-let us say human
life-wherever it exists in our universe does
not greatly differ in character from that of
our own planet mars venus mercury
even neptune are relatively close i be-
lieve the creator has constructed all human
life on the same general plan
   i believe that being neighbors-if i
may be permitted the expression-it is in-
tended that intercourse between the planets
should take place that we have been iso-
lated up to the present time is only because
of our ignorance-our inability to bridge the
gap i believe that migration friendship
commerce even war between the inhab-
itants of different planets of our solar sys-
tem was intended by almighty god-and
in good time will come to pass
   this is not science and yet science
does not contradict it in my opinion hu-
man life on mercury venus or mars may
need bodies taller shorter heavier lighter
more fragile or more solid than ours the
organs will differ from ours perhaps but
not materially so the senses will be the
same
   in a word i believe that nearly all the
range of diversity of human life existing on
any of the planets exists now on this earth
or has existed in the past or will exist in
the future through our own development
or at most the differences would not be
greater than a descent into our animal king-
dom would give us
   mercutians may have the sense of smell
developed to the point of a dog the instinct
of direction of the homing pigeon the eyes
of a cat in the dark or an owl in the light
but i cannot conceive of them being so
different that similar illustrations would not
apply
   i believe the creator intends inter-
course of some kind friendly or unfriendly
to take place between the worlds as china
was for centuries so for eons we of this
earth have been isolated that time is past
the first act was one of aggression let
us wait for the next calmly but soberly
with full realization of the danger for
we may be-indeed i think we are-ap-
proaching the time of greatest peril that
human life on this earth has ever had to
face
chapter iii
the landing of the invaders
march   was the date at which
mercury was again to be in inferior
conjunction-at her closest point to
the earth since her transit over the face of
the sun on november n of the previous
the fire people

year during february-after professor
newlands statements-the subject received
a tremendous amount of publicity some
scientific men rallied to professor new-
lands support others scouted the idea as
absurd
  officially the governments of the world
ignored the matter entirely in general
the press editorially wrote in a humorous
vein conjuring up many ridiculous possi-
bilities of what was about to happen the
public followed this lead it was amused
interested to a degree but as a mass
neither apprehensive nor serious-only cu-
rious
  in some parts of the earth-among the
smaller latin nations particularly-some
apprehension was felt but even so no one
knew what to do about it-where to go to
avoid the danger-for the attack if it came
at all was as likely to strike one country as
another
  the first week in march arrived with
public interest steadily increasing mer-
cury always difficult of observation pre-
sented no spectacle for the public gaze and
imagination to feed upon but all over the
world there were probably more eyes
turned toward the setting and rising sun
during that week than ever had been turned
there before
  professor newland issued no more state-
ments after that evening i have described
he was taken with a severe cold in the
latter part of february and as beth was
in delicate health and did not stand the
northern winters well the whole family left
for a few months stay at their bungalow
home in florida they were quite close
to the little village of bay head on the
gulf coast i kept in communication with
them there
  the th of march came and passed with-
out a report from any part of the earth
of the falling of the mercutian meteors
satirical comment in the press doubled
there was indeed no scientific report of
any unusual astronomical phenomena ex-
cept from the harvard observatory the fol-
lowing morning there professor new-
lands assistant professor brighton stated
he had again observed a new  star -an
interplanetary vehicle as professor new-
land described it only a single one had
been observed this time it was seen just
before dawn of the th
  then about  pm atlantic time on the
afternoon of the th the world was electri-
fied by the report of the landing of in-
vaders in the united states the news
came by wireless from billings montana
an interplanetary vehicle of huge size had
landed on the desert in the shoshone river
district of northern wyoming west of the
big horn mountains
  this strange visitor-it was described as
a gleaming silvery object perhaps a hun-
dred feet in diameter-had landed near the
little mormon settlement of byron the
hope that its mission might be friendly was
dispelled even in the first report from bil-
lings the characteristic red and green
light-fire had swept the country near by-
a horizontal beam this time-and the town
of byron was reported destroyed and in all
likelihood with the loss of its entire popula-
tion
  the boston observer sent me to billings
almost immediately by quadruplane i ar-
rived there about eight oclock on the eve-
ning of the th the city was in a tur-
moil ranchers from the neighboring cat-
tle country thronged its streets a perfect
exodus of people-mormons and oil men
from shoshone country almost the entire
populations of cody powell garland and
other towns near the threatened section the
indians from the crow reservation at
frannie-all were streaming through bil-
lings
  the wyoming state airplane patrol
gathered in a squadron by orders from
cheyenne occasionally passed overhead
flashing huge white searchlights i went
immediately to the office of the billings
dispatch it was so crowded i could not
get in from what i could pick up among
the excited frightened people of billings
and the various bulletins that the dispatch
had sent out during the day the devel-
opments of the first twenty-four hours of
mercutian invasion were these
  only a single  vehicle -we called it
that for want of a better name-had land-
ed airplane observation placed its exact
position on the west bank of the shoshone

argosy-allstory weekly
river about four miles southwest of byron
and the same distance southeast of gar-
land the country here is typically that of
the wyoming desert-sand and sagebrush
-slightly rolling in some places with occa-
sional hills and buttes
  the chicago burlington and quincy
railroad runs down its spur from the
northern pacific near billings passes
through the towns of frannie-near the
border of montana and wyoming-and
garland and terminates at cody this
line running special trains throughout the
day had brought up a large number of
people during the afternoon a bomb of
some kind-it was vaguely described as a
variation of the red and green light-rays-
had destroyed one of the trains near gar-
land the road was now open only down
to frannie
  the town of byron i learned was com-
pletely annihilated it had been swept by
the mercutian light and destroyed by fire
garland was as yet unharmed there was
broken country between it and the mer-
cutian invaders and the rays of the single
light which they were using could not reach
it directly
   such briefly was the situation as i found
it that evening of the ioth in billings we
were sixty-five miles north of the mercu-
tian landing place what power for attack
and destruction the enemy had we had
no means of determining how many of
them there were how they could travel
over the country what the effective radius
of their light-fire was the nature of the
 bomb  that had destroyed the train on
the c b and q near the town of gar-
land-all those were questions that no one
could answer
  billings was during those next few days
principally a gathering place and point of
departure for refugees yet so curiously
is the human mind constituted underneath
all this turmoil the affairs of billings went
on as before the stores did not close the
billings dispatch sent out its reports the
northern pacific trains from east and west
daily brought their quota of reporters pic-
ture men and curiosity seekers and took
away all who had sense enough to go the
c b and q continued running trains to
frannie-which was about fifteen miles
from the mercutian landing place-and
many of the newspaper men most of those
in fact who did not have airplanes went
there
  that first evening in billings rolland
mercer-a chap about my own age who
had brought me from the east in one of the
boston observers planes-and i decided
on a short flight about the neighboring
country to look the situation over we
started about midnight a crisp cloudless
night with no moon we had been warned
against venturing into the danger zone sev-
eral of the wyoming patrol and numbers of
private planes had been seen to fall in
flames when the light struck them
  we had no idea what the danger zone
was-how close we dared go-but decided
to chance it to fly sufficiently high for
safety directly over the merqatians ap-
peared difficult since the light-fire already
had proven effective at a distance of several
miles at least we decided not to attempt
that but merely to follow the course of
the c b and q southwest to cody then
to circle around to the east and thence back
north to billings passing well to the east of
the mercutians
  we started as i have said about mid-
night rising from the rolling prairie back
of billings we climbed five hundred feet
and with our searchlight playing upon the
ground beneath started directly for fran-
nie we passed over frannie at about
eight hundred feet and continued on the
c b and q line toward garland we
had decided to pass to a considerable extent
to the west of garland to be farther away
from the danger and then to strike down to
cody
  we were flying now at a speed close to a
hundred and forty miles an hour off to
the left i could see the red and green beam
of the single light of the mercutians it
was pointing vertically up into the air mo-
tionless something-i do not know what
-made me decide to turn off our search-
light
  i looked behind us some miles away
and considerably nearer the mercutians
than we were i saw the light of another
plane i was watching it when suddenly
the fire people

the red and green beam swung toward it
and a moment later picked it up i
caught a fleeting glimpse of what i took
to be a little biplane it remained for an
instant illuminated by the weird red and
green flare then the mercutian light
swung back to its vertical position a sec-
ond later the biplane burst into flames and
fell
  the thing left me shuddering i turned
our searchlight permanently off and sat
staring down at the shadowy country scur-
rying away beneath us
  mercer had evidently not seen this trag-
edy he did not look at me but kept facing
the front we were now somewhat to the
west of garland with it between us and the
mercutians the few lights of the town
could be seen plainly the country be-
neath us seemed fairly level to the west
half a mile away perhaps i could make
out a sheer perpendicular wall of rock we
seemed to be flying parallel with it and
about level with its top
  we were rising a little i think when
suddenly our-engines stopped i remember
it flashed through my mind to wonder how
mercer would dare shut them off when we
were flying so low the sudden silence
confused me a little i started to ask him
if he had seen the biplane fall when he
swung back abruptly and gripped me by the
arm
   turn on the light-you fool-weve got
to land
  i fumbled with the searchlight then
just as i turned the switch i saw rising
from a point near the base of the mercu-
tian light what appeared to be a sky-
rocket
  it rose in a long graceful arc reached
the top of its ascent and came down still
flaming i remember deciding it would fall
in or near garland
  it seemed to go out just before it landed
-at least i did not follow it all the way
down then there came a flash as though
a huge quantity of red and green smoke-
less powder had gone off in a puff a brief
instant of darkness and then flames rose
from a hundred points in the little town
the next second our wheels ground in the
sand
  i heard a splintering crash something
struck me violently on the shoulder then-
blackness
chapter iv
the meeting
professor newland and his fam-
ily were living in seclusion in their
florida home at the time the mer-
cutian invaders landed in wyoming the
curious events in florida which connected
them so directly with the invasion and
caused alan later to play so vital a part in
it are so important that i am impelled to
relate them chronologically rather than as
they were told me afterward by alan and
beth
  when on march  the news that the
mercutians had landed in wyoming reached
professor newland he immediately estab-
lished telegraphic communication with har-
vard thus he was kept fully informed on
the situation-indeed he saw it as a whole
far better than i did
  on march  three days after the land-
ing orders from washington were given
out regulating all passenger transportation
in the direction of the danger zone one
hundred miles was the limit set state
troops were placed on all trains state roads
were likewise guarded and the state air-
plane patrols united in a vigilant effort to
keep outside planes from getting it on
the th the president of the united states
issued an appeal to all persons living within
the hundred-mile limit asking them to
leave
  on march  the canadian government
offered its assistance in any way possible-
its saskatchewan airplane patrol was al-
ready helping montana maintain the hun-
dred-mile limit similar offers were imme-
diately made by nearly every government
in the world
  such were the first main steps taken to
safeguard the people
  by march  the actual conditions of af-
fairs in the threatened section of wyoming
was fairly well known the town of gar-
land was destroyed by fire on the night of
the th and the towns of mantua and

argosy-allstory weekly
powell-north and south of garland respec-
tively-the following morning on the eve-
ning of the nth a government plane flying
without lights sacrificed itself in an attempt
to drop a bomb into the mercutian camp
it was caught by the light when almost
directly over the mercutians and was seen
to fall in flames
  it was estimated that the single light
was controlling an area with a radius of
about ten miles to the south and west
there was practically nothing but desert to
the west garland mantua and powell were
burned to the north deaver and crowley
-on another branch of the c b and q
about ten miles from the mercutians-were
as yet unharmed they were however
entirely deserted by the th
  during these days the mercutians did
not move from their first landing place
newspaper speculation regarding their ca-
pabilities for offensive action ran rife per-
haps they could not move they appeared
to possess but one ray of light-fire this had
an effective radius of ten miles the only
other offensive weapon shown was the rock-
et or bomb that had destroyed the c
b and q train near garland and the town
itself reports differed as to what had set
fire to the town of powell
  all these points were less than ten miles
away from the mercutian base obvious-
ly then the danger was grossly exagger-
ated the unknown invaders could safely
and easily be shelled by artillery from a
much greater distance mercury had passed
inferior conjunction no other mercutian
vehicles had been reported as landing any-
where on the earth a few days and the
danger would be over thus the news-
papers of the country settled the affair
  on march th it was announced that
general price would conduct the military
operations against the mercutians press
dispatches simultaneously announced that
troops machine guns and artillery were
being rushed to billings this provoked a
caustic comment from the preparedness
league of america to the effect that no
military operations of any offensive value
could be conducted by the united states
against anybody or anything
  this statement was to some extent true
during the twenty years that had elapsed
since the world war armament of all kinds
had fallen into disuse few improvements
in offensive weapons had been made the
military organization and equipment of the
united states and indeed that of many
of the other great powers was admittedly
inadequate to cope with any very powerful
enemy
  professor newland telegraphed to the
war department at washington on the
th stating that in his opinion new sci-
entific measures would have to be devised
to deal with this enemy and that what-
ever scientific knowledge he had on the
subject was at their disposal at their re-
quest to this telegram the government
never replied
  it was a day or two after that-on the
morning of the th to be exact-that
the next most important development in
this strange affair took place alan new-
land rose that morning at dawn and took
his launch for a trip up one of the neigh-
boring bayous he was alone and intended
to fish for an hour or so and return home in
time for breakfast
  he went perhaps three miles up the
winding little stream then just after sun-
rise he shut off the motor and drifted si-
lently along the bayou split into two
streams here coming together again a
quarter of a mile farther on and thus form-
ing a little island it was just past the
point of this island that alan shut off his
motor
  he had been sitting quiet several min-
utes preparing his tackle when his eye
caught something moving behind the dark
green of the magnolia trees hanging over
the low banks of the island it seemed to
be a flicker of red and white some five feet
above the ground instinctively he reached
for the little rifle he had brought with him
to shoot at it thinking it might be a bird
although he had never seen one before of
such a color
  a moment later in the silence he heard
a rustling of the palmettos near the bank
of the bayou he waited quiet with the
rifle across his knees his launch was still
moving forward slowly from the impetus of
the motor and then quite suddenly he
the fire people

came into sight of the figure of a girl stand-
ing motionless beside a tree on the island
a few feet back from the water and evident-
ly watching him
  alan was startled he knew there was
no one living on the island there were
in fact few people at all in the vicinity-
only an occasional negro shack or the sim-
ilar shack of the  poor white trash and
a turpentine camp several miles back in the
pines
  but it was not the presence of the girl
here on the island at daybreak that sur-
prised him most but the appearance of the
girl herself he sat staring at her dumbly
wondering if he were awake or dreaming
for the girl-who otherwise might have
appeared nothing more than an extraordi-
narily beautiful young female of this earth
somewhat fantastically dressed-the girl
had wings
  he rubbed his eyes and looked again
there was no doubt about it-they were
huge deep-red feathered wings reaching
from her shoulder blades nearly to the
ground she took a step away from the
tree and flapped them once or twice idly
alan could see they would measure nearly
ten feet from tip to tip when outstretched
his launch had lost its forward motion now
and for the moment was lying motionless
in the sluggish bayou hardly fifty feet
separated him from the girl
  her eyes stared into his for a time-a
quiet curious stare with no hint of fear
in it then she smiled her lips moved
but the soft words that reached him across
the water were in a language he could not
understand but he comprehended her
gesture it distinctly bade him come ashore
alan took a new grip on himself gathered
his scattered wits and tried to think con-
nectedly
  he laid his rifle in the bottom of the
launch then just as he was reaching for
an oar he saw back among the tall cab-
bage palms on the island in an open space
a glowing silvery object like a house paint-
ed silver and shining under the rays of a
brilliant sun
  then the whole thing came to him he
remembered the press descriptions from
wyoming of the mercutian vehicle he
saw this white rectangle on the little flor-
ida island as a miniature of that which
had brought the invaders of wyoming from
space and then this girl-
  fear for an instant supplanted amaze-
ment in alan newlands heart he looked
around he could see back into the trees
plainly almost across the island he stood
up in the boat there seemed no one else
in sight
  alan sat down and taking up the oar
sculled the launch toward the spot where
the girl was standing his mind still re-
fused to think clearly the vague thought
came to him that he might be struck dead
by some unknown power the instant he
landed then as he again met the girls
eyes-a clear direct honest gaze with
something of a compelling dignity in it-
his fear suddenly left him
  a moment later the bow of the launch
pushed its way through the wire grass and
touched the bank alan laid aside his oar
tied the boat to a half-submerged log and
stepped ashore
chapter v
captured
when i recovered consciousness i
found myself lying in the sand with
mercer sitting beside me it was
still night the tangled wreckage of our
airplane lay near by evidently mercer had
carried me out of it
 i sat up
   im all right i said  what hap-
pened
  he grinned at me with relief
   the damned engine stopped i dont
know what was the matter you had the
light off i couldnt see anything when we
got down close
  he waved his hand toward the wrecked
plane
   its done for he added  but im not
hurt much are you
   no i said  im all right
  i climbed to my feet unsteadily my
head seemed about to split open
   garlands burning he added
over the desert some two or three miles

argosy-allstory weekly
away the burning town could be seen
plainly
   what are we going to do mercer
asked after a moment
  i was pretty weak and badly bruised all
over mercer seemed to have fared better
than i we talked over our situation at
length finally we decided to rest where
we were until daybreak i would feel bet-
ter then and we could start back on foot
for mantua and frannie
  i lay down again-my head was going
round like a top-and mercer sat beside
me it was pretty cold but we were warm-
ly dressed and not uncomfortable the
fact that we were so close to the mercu-
tians-not much over seven or eight miles-
worried us a little but we reasoned that
we were in no great danger we could still
see their light-ray standing vertically in the
air
  occasionally it would swing slowly to one
side or the other once it swung toward
us but as its base was in a hollow it was
cut off by the higher ground between as it
swung down and we knew it could not
reach us from that position
  after a while i fell asleep when mercer
woke me up it was dawn
   lets get started he said  im hun-
gry as the devil
  i felt much better now i was hungry
myself and stiff and chilled
   youll feel better walking he added
 come on it  take us a deuce of a while
over this sand
  we decided to strike for the railroad at
its closest point to us the state auto-
mobile road to cody ran along near the
railroad and we planned to follow that up
to mantua
  after a last look at our plane which was
hopelessly demolished we started off head-
ing north of garland we had been walk-
ing along a few minutes when mercer sud-
denly gripped me by the arm i followed
the direction of his glance another rock-
et was rising from the mercutian base it
was still dark enough for us to see its flare
as it rose and curved in a long graceful arc
we stopped stock still and stood watching
the rocket arched over to the north as
it came down we lost sight of it
   that went into mantua said mercer
in a horrified whisper
  a moment later we saw in the direction
of mantua that brief silent smokeless red
and green flash then the sky lighted up
a lurid red and we knew mantua was burn
ing
  we stood looking at each other for a
time too frightened and horrified for words
the thing was not like modern warfare
it was uncanny in its silent deadliness and
there seemed a surety about it that was
appalling
   were cut off said mercer finally
  his face was white and his voice trem-
bled
  we were both pretty much unnerved but
after a moment we got ourselves together
and talked calmly about what was best for
us to do
  we concluded finally to go ahead to the
road we calculated we were not over two
miles from the nearest part of it we would
strike it about halfway between garland
and mantua and we thought it just possi-
ble we would find passing along it some
refugees from the two towns i couldnt
quite see how meeting them could help
us any unless we encountered some vehicle
that would give us a lift however the
walking would be easier and when we got
to the road we could decide which way to
go-north to frannie or south around gar-
land to powell
  the sun was just rising when we started
again it took us nearly an hour to reach
the road as far as we could see it was
deserted we stopped here and held an-
other consultation
   its easily twelve miles up to frannie
i said  and i dont believe more than
eight to powell lets go that way we
can get down to cody from there i guess
there are still people left in powell
  we started down the road toward gar-
land it seemed the sensible thing to do
we were both famished by now and thirsty
also i had an idea that since the fires
in garland were about burned out there
might be an isolated house unharmed where
we could find food and water
  i sometimes wonder now at our temerity
in venturing so calmly to face this unknown
                    the fire
                    
danger we were in the enemys country
-an enemy whose methods of attacking us
might at any moment prove a hundred
times more efficacious than they had so
far but we did not consider that then
  there was indeed nothing else we could
have done advantageously this road we
were on was the only one within twenty or
thirty miles to have struck west from
our wrecked plane-away from the mercu-
tians-would have brought us to face a
hundred miles or more of desert over to the
yellowstone
  it was now broad daylight-and almost
cloudless as is usual in this locality half
an hour of walking brought us nearly to
the outskirts of garland there was less
smoke all the time we judged the fire
must be pretty well burned out by now
behind us the smoke of mantua a much
larger town than garland rose in a great
rolling cloud
  we were walking along wondering what
we should find ahead when suddenly behind
garland and off to the right we saw an-
other huge cloud of smoke rising
   powell ejaculated mercer coming to
a dead stop in the road  good god
theyve got powell too
  there was no doubt about it-the town
of powell was also in flames we sat down
together then at the side of the road we
didnt quite know what else to do we
were both faint our situation seemed
every moment to be getting worse we ap-
peared further from even comparative safe-
ty now than when we left our plane at
dawn
  there seemed nothing else to do now
but go ahead into garland a distance of
only half a mile there we might find food
and water and thus refreshed we could
start back north to cover the fifteen miles
to frannie
  garland a few days before was a town
of about five hundred inhabitants but i
do not suppose that at the time of its
destruction there were more than a score or
two of people remaining in it
  we started off again and within twenty
minutes were among the smoldering houses
of the town it consisted practically of
only one street-the road we were on-with
people	
the houses strung along it the houses had
been most of them small frame structures
they were nothing now but smoldering
heaps of ashes with the chimneys left stand-
ing like gaunt silent sentinels as we
passed on down the road we saw several
twisted forms that we took for the remains
of human beings it is unnecessary for me
to describe them we hurried on shud-
dering
  our objective was the lower end of the
town for there perhaps a quarter of a mile
off to one side with a branch road leading
to it we saw a single house and out-
buildings left standing we turned down
this road and approached the house it
was a rather good-looking building of the
bungalow type with a wide-spreading porch
beside it stood a long low rectangular
building we took to be a garage there
was an automobile standing in the door-
way and behind it we caught the white
gleam of an airplane wing
   were all right now cried mercer
 theres a car and theres a plane inside
one of them ought to run
  at this unexpected good fortune we were
jubilant we could get back to billings
now in short order
  we climbed up the porch steps and en-
tered the house we did not call out for
it seemed obvious that no one would be
there after what had occurred in garland
so near by
   there must be something to eat here
i said  lets find out-and then get back
to billings
  the big living room was empty but there
was no sign of disorder a closed door stood
near at hand
   that might be the way to the kitchen
i suggested  come on
  i pushed open the door and entered with
mercer close behind me it was a bed-
room the bed stood over by a window
i stopped in horror for on the bed hunched
forward in a sitting position was the body
of a man
  with the first sudden shock of surprise
over we stopped to note details the mans
hand lying on the blanket clutched a re-
volver a mirror directly across from him
was shattered as though by a bullet a

argosy-allstory weekly
small bedroom chair was overturned near
the center of the room
   he-he isnt burned mercer spoke
the words hardly above a whisper  some-
thing else killed him-theres been a fight
they-
  he stopped
  a sudden panic seized me i wanted to
run-to do something - anything - that
would get me away from the nameless
silent terror that seemed all about
   come on i whispered back  god
lets get out of here
  as we got out into the living room we
heard slow dragging footsteps on the porch
outside we stopped again shrinking back
against the wall
   they-they-its- mercers whis-
pered words died away we were both ter-
rified beyond the power of reasoning the
dragging footsteps came closer-a sound
that had in it nothing of human tread
then we heard soft voices-words that were
unintelligible
   its the mercutians i found voice to
whisper  they-
  a figure appeared in the porch doorway
outlined against the light behind-the figure
of a short squat man he seemed to have
on some sort of white furry garment he
was bareheaded with hair falling to his
shoulders
  at the sight of him my terror suddenly
left me here was an enemy i could cope
with the dread fear of supernatural beings
that had possessed me evaporated
  with a shout to mercer i dashed for-
ward directly at the doorway i think the
mercutian had not yet seen us he stood
quite still his body blocking the full width
of the doorway
  i let fly with my fist as i came up and
hit him full in the face at the same in-
stant my body struck his he toppled back-
ward and i went through the doorway i
tripped over him on the porch outside and
fell sprawling before i could rise three
other mercutians fell upon me and pinned
me down
  mercer was right behind me in the door-
way i saw him pause an instant to see
what was happening there seemed to be
live mercutians altogether the one i had
hit lay quite still three others were hold-
ing me
  the fifth stood to one side watching
mercer but apparently inactive
  i saw mercer hesitate an expression of
surprise came over his face his body
swayed he took a single step forward half
turned and then fell in a crumpled heap
chapter vi
miela
the girl stood quiet beside the tree
watching alan as he tied up his boat
she continued smiling alan stood
up and faced her he wondered what he
should say-whether she could understand
him any better than he could her
   you speak english he began hesi-
tantly
  the girl did not answer at once she
seemed to be trying to divine his mean-
ing then she waved her hand-a curious
movement which he took to be a gesture
of negation-her broadening smile disclos-
ing teeth that were small even and very
white
  at this closer view alan could see she
was apparently about twenty years old as
time is reckoned on earth her body was
very slender gracefully rounded yet with
an appearance of extreme fragility her
slenderness and the long sleek wings be-
hind made her appear taller than she really
was actually she was about the height of
a normal woman of our own race
  her legs were covered by a pair of trou-
sers of some silky fabric grayish blue in
color her bare feet were incased in san-
dals the golden cords of which crossed
her insteps and wound about her ankles
fastening down the lower hems of the trou-
sers a silken gray-blue scarf was wound
about her waist crossing in front it passed
up over her breast and shoulders crossing
again between the wings behind and de-
scending to the waist
  her hair was a smooth glossy black it
was parted in the middle covered her ears
and came forward over each shoulder the
plaits were bound tightly around with silk-
en cords each was fastened to her body
the fire people

in two places at the waist and where the
plait ended the outside of the trouser leg
just above the knee
  her skin was cream colored smooth in
texture and with a delicate flush of red
beneath the surface her eyes were black
her face small and oval with a delicately
pointed chin there was nothing remark-
able about her features except that they
were extraordinarily beautiful but-and
this point alan noticed at once-there was
in her expression in the delicacy of her
face a spiritual look that he had never seen
in a woman before it made him trust
her and-even then i think-love her
too
  such was the strange girl as alan saw
her that morning standing beside the tree
on the bank of the little florida bayou
   i cant talk your language said alan
he realized it was a silly thing to say but
his smile answered hers and he went for-
ward until he was standing close beside her
she did not appear so tall now for he
towered over her the strength and bigness
of his frame making hers seem all the frailer
by contrast
  he held out his hand the girl looked at
it puzzled
   wont you shake hands he said and
then he realized that too was a silly re-
mark
  she wrinkled up her forehead in thought
then with a sudden comprehension she
laughed-a soft little ripple of laughter-
and placed her hand awkwardly in his
  as he released her hand she reached hers
forward and brushed it lightly against his
cheek alan understood that was her form
of greeting then she spread her wings and
curtsied low-making as charming a pic-
ture he thought as he had ever seen in his
life
  as she straightened up her eyes laughed
into his and again she spoke a few soft
words - wholly unintelligible then she
pointed toward the sun which was still
low over the horizon and then to the silver
object lying back near the center of the
island
   i know said alan  mercury
  the girl repeated his last word imme-
diately enunciating it almost perfectly
then she laid her hand upon her breast
saying
   miela
   alan he answered indicating himself
  the girl laughed delightedly repeating
the word several times then she took him
by the hand and made him understand
that she wished to lead him back into the
island
  they started off and then alan noticed
a curious thing she walked as though
weighted to the ground by some invisible
load she did not raise her feet normally
but dragged them like a diver who walks
on land in his heavily weighted iron shoes
after a few steps she spread her wings and
flapping them slowly was able to get along
better although it was obvious that she
could not lift her body off the ground to
fly
  for a moment alan was puzzled then
he understood the force of gravity on
earth was too great for the power of her
muscles which were developed only to meet
the pull of mercury-a very much smaller
planet
  the girl was so exceedingly frail alan
judged she did not weigh here on earth
much over a hundred pounds but even
that he could see was too much for her
she could not fly and it was only by the
aid of her wings that she was able to walk
with anything like his own freedom of move-
ment
  he made her understand somehow that
he comprehended her plight then after a
time he put his left arm about her waist
she spread the great red wings out behind
him the right one passing over his shoul-
der and in this fashion they went forward
more easily
  the girl kept constantly talking and ges-
turing she seemed remarkably intelligent
and even then at the very beginning of
their acquaintanceship she made alan un-
derstand that she intended to learn his
language indeed she seemed concerned
about little else and she went about her
task systematically and with an ability that
amazed him
  as they walked forward she kept con-
tinually stooping to touch objects on the
ground-a stick a handful of sand a

argosy-allstory weekly
woodland flower or a palmetto leaf or
again she would indicate articles of his
clothing or his features in each case alan
gave her the english word and in each case
she repeated it after him
  once she stopped stock still and with as-
tonishing rapidity and accuracy rattled off
the whole list-some fifteen or twenty words
altogether-pointing out each object as she
enunciated the word
  alan understood then-and he found out
afterward it was the case-that the girls
memory was extraordinarily retentive far
more retentive than is the case with any
normal earth person he discovered also
a little later that her intuitive sense was
highly developed she seemed in many in-
stances to divine his meaning quite apart
from his words or the gestures-which often
were unintelligible to her-with which he
accompanied them -
  after a time they reached the mercu-
tian vehicle it was a cubical box with a
pyramid-shaped top some thirty feet square
at the base and evidently constructed of
metal a gleaming white nearer like silver
than anything else alan could think of he
saw that it had a door on the side facing
him and several little slitlike windows cov-
ered by a thick transparent substance
which might have been glass
  as they got up close to it alan expected
the girls companions to come out his
heart beat faster suddenly he raised his
voice and shouted
   hello inside
  the girl looked startled then she
smiled and made the negative gesture with
her hand
  alan understood then that she was alone
they went inside the vehicle it was dark
in there alan could make out little but
after a moment his eyes grew accustomed to
the darkness
  he noticed first that the thing was very
solidly constructed he expected to see
some complicated mechanism but there was
little or nothing of the kind so far as he
could make out in the darkness in this first
hurried inspection
  fastened to one wall was an apparatus
which he judged was for the making of
oxygen he looked around for batteries
and for electric lights but could see nothing
of the kind
  all this time alans mind had been busily
trying to puzzle out the mystery of the girls
presence here alone evidently she came in
the most friendly spirit and thus quite
evidently her mission whatever it was
must be very different from that of the
invaders who had landed almost simulta-
neously in wyoming
  whatever it was that had brought her-
whatever her purpose-he realized it must
be important the girl even now seemed
making no effort to show or explain any-
thing to him but continued plying him with
questions that gave her the english words
of everything about them that she could
readily indicate
  alan knew then that she must have some-
thing important to communicate-some-
thing that she wanted to say as quickly as
possible and he knew that she realized
the only way was for her to learn his lan-
guage which she was doing with the least
possible loss of time and with an utter
disregard of everything else that might have
obtruded
  alan decided then to take the girl back
home with him-indeed it had never been
in his mind to do anything else-and let
beth care for her meanwhile he would do
everything he could to help her get the
knowledge necessary to make known what
it was that had brought her from mercury
that she had some direct connection with
the wyoming invaders he did not doubt
  alan had just reached this decision when
the girl made him realize that she had the
same thought in mind she pointed around
the room and then to herself and he knew
that she was insisting upon a general word
to include all her surroundings
  finally alan answered  house
  after pointing to him she- waved her
hand vaguely toward the country outside
the open doorway and he understood she
was asking where his house was
  alans decision was given promptly
 well go there he said
  he put his arm about her and started
out by the way she immediately respond-
ed he knew she understood and that it was
what she wished to do
                   	a
the fire people

  they got back to alans launch in a few
moments he seated her in the stern of the
boat where she half reclined with her wings
spread out a little behind her so assid-
uous was she-and so facile-in her task of
learning english that before she would let
him start the motor she had learned the
names of many of the new objects in sight
and several verbs connected with his actions
of the moment
   there was a large tarpaulin in the launch
and this alan wrapped about the girls
shoulders he did not want her vivid red
wings to be seen by any one as they passed
down the bayou
   finally they started off
  professor newlands home was some
three miles from the village of bay head
on the shore of a large bay which opened
into the gulf of mexico the bayou down
which they were heading flowed into this
bay near where the house stood their
home was quite isolated alan thought with
satisfaction there was no other habita-
tion nearer than bay head except a few
negro shacks with the girls wings cov-
ered he could take her home and keep her
there in absolute conclusion without caus-
ing any comment that might complicate
things
  on the way down the bayou the girl
showed extreme interest in everything about
her she seemed to have no fear trusting
alan implicitly in his guidance and protec-
tion of her in this strange world she con-
tinued her questions she laughed frequent-
ly with almost a childlike freedom from
care only once or twice he noticed as
some thought occurred to her the laughter
died away her face suddenly sobered and
a far-away misty look came into her beau-
tiful eyes
  alan sat close beside her in the stern
steering the launch and occasionally pulling
the tarpaulin back onto her shoulders when
it threatened to slip off because of her im-
petuous gestures
  they saw only a few negroes as they
passed down the bayou and these paid no
particular attention to them within an
hour alan had the girl safely inside the
bungalow and was introducing her with
excited explanations to his astonished fa-
   	a 
ther and sister who were just at that
moment sitting down to breakfast
chapter vii
the mercutian camp
as i saw mercer fall to the floor of the
l porch a sudden rage swept over me
i struggled violently with the three
men pinning me down they appeared
very much weaker than i but even though
i could break their holds the three of them
were more than a match for me
  the man who was standing inactive and
who i realized had struck down mercer in
some unknown deadly way appeared to be
the leader once as one of my assailants
made some move the import of which the
leader evidently understood but which i
did not i heard him give a sharp com-
mand it occurred to me then that if i
offered too much resistance-if it seemed
i was likely to get away from them-i
might possibly be struck as swiftly as mer-
cer had been so i gave up abruptly and
lay still
  they must have understood my motive-
or perhaps they felt that i was not worth
the trouble of taking alive-for immediate-
ly i stopped struggling they unhanded me
and rose to their feet
  i stood up also deciding to appear quite
docile for the time being at any rate
until i could comprehend better with what
i had to contend
  the man who appeared to be their leader
issued another command one of the men
with whom i had been struggling imme-
diately stepped a few feet away out of my
reach i knew he had been told to guard
one he kept just that distance away there-
after following my movements closely and
seeming never to take his eyes off me for a
moment
  i had opportunity now to inspect these
strange enemies more closely the leader
was the tallest he was about five and a
half feet in height i judged and fairly
stocky the others were all considerably
shorter-not much over five feet perhaps
all were broad-framed although not stout
to any degree approaching fatness

argosy-allstory weekly
  from their appearance they might all
have been fairly powerful men the leader
especially but even the short struggle
i had had with them showed me they were
not their bodies too had seemed under
my grip to have a flimsy quality a lack of
firmness of solidity entirely belied by their
appearance
  they were all dressed in a single rude
garment of short white fur made all in one
piece trousers and shirt and leaving only
their arms bare their feet were incased
in buskins that seemed to be made of leath-
er their hair was a reddish-brown color
and fell scraggling a little below the shoul-
der line
  their skin was a curious dead white-
like the pallor of a man long in prison
their faces which had no sign of hair on
them were broad with broad flat noses
and with abnormally large eyes that seemed
to blink stolidly with an owl-like stare
  their leader was of somewhat different
type he was as i have said nearly six
inches taller than the others and leaner and
more powerful looking his hair was black
and his skin was not so dead white his
eyes were not so abnormally large as those
of his companions his nose was straight
with a high bridge his face was hairless
it was a strong face with an expression of
dignity about it a consciousness of power
and a certain sense of cruelty expressed in
the firmness of his lips and the set of his
chin
  none of them was armed-or at least
their weapons were not visible to me
  i was much concerned about mercer he
and the man i had hit were both lying mo-
tionless where they had fallen i stooped
over mercer no one offered to stop me
although when i moved i saw my guard
make a swift movement with his hand to
his belt my heart leaped to my throat
but nothing happened to me and i made
a hasty examination of mercer
  quite evidently he was dead
  meanwhile the mercutians were examin-
ing their fallen comrade he also was dead
i judged from their actions they left him
where he was lying and their leader impa-
tiently signed me toward the steps that led
down from the porch to the roadway we
started off my guard keeping close behind
me i noticed then how curiously ham-
pered the mercutians seemed to be in their
movements
  i have explained how alan observed the
effect of our earths gravity on miela it
was even more marked with the mercutians
here for she had the assistance of wings
while they did not the realization of this
encouraged me tremendously i knew now
that physically these enemies were no match
for me that i could break away from them
whenever i wished
  but the way in which mercer had been
killed-that i could not understand it
was that i had to guard against i was
afraid to do anything that would expose me
to this unknown attack
  i tried to guess over how great a dis-
tance this weapon whatever it was would
prove effective i assumed only a limited
number of feet although my only reason
for thinking so was my guards evident de-
termination to keep close to me
  all this flashed through my mind while
we were descending the steps to the road-
way when we reached the ground we
turned back toward the garage and with
slow plodding steps the leader of the mer-
cutians preceded me to its entrance his
companions following close behind me
they had evidently been here before i
could tell from their actions i realized
that probably they had all been inside the
garage when mercer and i first approached
the house
  it was quite apparent now that the mer-
cutians did not understand the use of either
automobiles or airplanes they poked
around these as though they were some
strange silent animals inside the garage
i was ordered to stand quiet with my guard
near by while the rest of them continued
what appeared to be a search about the
building
  we passed by the house and i realized
that we were starting for the mercutian
base some four miles away i remembered
then that i was extremely hungry and
thirsty i stopped suddenly and endeav-
ored to explain my wants indicating the
house as a place where i could get food
  the leader smiled his name was tao
the fire people

 i had learned from hearing his men address
 him i do not know why that smile reas-
 sured me but it did it seemed somehow
 to make these enemies less inhuman-less
 supernatural-in my mind indeed i was
 fast losing my first fear of them although
 i still had a great respect for the way in
 which they had killed mercer
   tao told his men to wait and motioned
 me toward the house the bodies of mer-
 cer and the man i had struck down were
 still lying where they had fallen on the
 porch we found food and water in the
 kitchen and i sat down and made a meal
 while tao stood watching me when i
 had finished i put several slices of bread
 and meat in my coat he signified that it
 was unnecessary but i insisted and he
 smiled again and let me have my way
   again we started off this walk of four
 miles of desert that lay between garland
 and the point on the shoshone river where
 the invaders were established was about all
 i could manage for i was almost exhaust-
 ed i realized then how great an exertion
 the mercutians were put to for they seemed
 nearly as tired as i we stopped frequent-
 ly to rest and it was well after noon when
 we approached the hollow through which
 the shoshone river ran
   several times i noticed where the mer-
 cutian light had burned off the scrubby
 desert vegetation as we got closer i could
 see it now in the sunlight standing verti-
 cally up in the air motionless there were
 signs all about now where the light had
 burned we were passing along a little
 gully-the country here was somewhat
 rough and broken up-when something
 came abruptly from behind a rock its ex-
 traordinary appearance startled me so i
 stared at it in amazement and fear it
 came closer and i saw it was one of the
 mercutians
   he was completely incased in a suit of
 dull black cloth or rubber or something of
 the kind on his head was a helmet of the
 same material with a mask over his face
 having two huge circular openings covered
 with a flexible transparent substance on
 his back was a sort of tank with a pipe
 leading to his mouth he looked indeed
something like a man in a diving suit and
still more like the pictures i had seen of
soldiers in the world war with gas masks
on he pulled off his helmet as he came
up to us and i saw he avas similar in ap-
pearance to the red-haired mercutians who
had captured me
  after a short conversation with tao he
went back to his station by the rock and
we proceeded onward down the gully to
the river bank i saw a number of mercu-
tians dressed this way during the afternoon
they seemed to be guarding the approaches
to the camp and i decided later this cos-
tume was for protection against the effects
of the light-ray
  the shoshone river was at this point
about two hundred feet wide and -at this
season of the year a swift-moving icy
stream some two or three feet deep there
were small trees at intervals along its banks
all about me now i could see where they
had been burned by the action of the light
  the vehicle in which the invaders had
arrived lay on the near side of the river
some five hundred feet below where we
came out of the gully it was similar in
appearance to the one alan had found in
florida only many times larger it lay
there now with its pyramid-shaped top
pointing up into the air close beside the
river and gleaming a dazzling white under
the rays of the afternoon sun
  there were perhaps a hundred mercu-
tians in sight altogether most of them
were down by the vehicle all of them were
on this side of the river in fact as i soon
realized it would have been difficult if not
impossible for them to have crossed the
desert on the opposite side of the shoshone
was level and unbroken it was swept clear
of everything apparently by the light-ray
  we turned down the river bank and soon
were close to the shining vehicle that had
brought these strange invaders from space
what would i see in this camp of the first
beings to reach earth from another planet
what fate awaited me there these ques-
tions hammered at my brain as we ap-
proached the point where so much death
and destruction had been dealt out to the
surrounding country

 in the grounds of a villa outside algiers
 in the year  two men were sitting
 on a low stone garden seat beneath an
 orange tree
  a horses head said patrick spence
 and frowned  with no inscription
  it needs none
 dr shaw peered at the bronze coin in
 his hand brushing the fresh earth from it
 lovingly
 as his spade and the dirt on his strong
 brown forearms testified spence had been
 at work in the garden when the coin turned
 up he drew at his pipe with the quiet
 satisfaction of one who has labored hard

 he had the piercing far-seeing eyes of a
 sailor
 dr shaw had walked from the city he
 wore a camel-hair burnoose which kept the
 intense sunlight from his lean spare frame
 he was a tall man erect and muscular one
 sensed something sweet and kindly in his
 smile as he regarded the coin
   this horses head is inscription enough
  patrick he mused  it shows the coin
  to be of punic times i have not a few of
  them you will recall the lines
   locus in urbe fuit media laetissimus umbra
  quo primum jactati undis-
 the younger man broke in upon the -
 norously rolling lines with a laugh
  no no doctor the little latin i
 ever knew was forgot in the vortex of navi
down the coast of barbary

gation you oxford men always seem
ready to spout greek and latinity-but we
havent time for much of that in america
and youd better take off that burnoose or
youll sweat to death before you know it
absent-mindedly dr shaw loosened his
garment his eyes lifted to the sea
   a sweet spot patrick 
  the american nodded well outside the
tottering walls of algiers along the pleas-
ant northern hill-slopes the white blaze of
sunlight was here broken by gardens and
villas bordering a winding road the scent
of orange-fiowers clustered thickly the
flashing red of pomegranates glimmered
among the greenery here were groves and
fountains flowers and running brooks in
sharp contrast to the squalid heat and
crowded city streets
   something like this had virgilius in
mind observed shaw  when he spoke of
the old corycian gardener and his won-
drous fruit by the way -he glanced at
his burnoose- this garment is most in-
teresting patrick
   it must have been shaped after the
cloak of the little god telesphorus straight
about the neck with a hippocratess sleeve
for cowl it answers i take it to the pal-
lium or the cucullus of the gauls men-
tioned by martial or to the cloaks wherein
the israelites folded up their kneading
troughs as do the moors to this day-
the younger man leaped to his feet
hello he cried sharply shaw
somethings happened heres one of the
consulate negroes on the run
  a man became visible running along the
road he was a black man his nearly
naked skin glistened with sweat panting
he turned in at the gate and came lo them
with a hasty salutation he addressed
shaav in a chatter of arabic
   bless my soul
  the good doctor turned he acted as
interpreter chaplain and general factotum
to the english consulate
   they want me at once-i know not
what has happened patrick remain here
if you will i am most anxious to have
those specimen roots from egypt laid under
the soil before the sun withers them if it
be not imposing on your-
   its the least i can do said patrick
spence  ill be glad to keep busy dont
forget the tobacco you promised to bring
me be sure to get virginia leaf from that
shop next the consulate all the others
sell only turkish and i like not the stuff
  the rev thomas shaw dd f r s
fellow of queens college oxford strode
away hastily with the negro he turned
to wave his hand then vanished from sight
  patrick spence knocked out his pipe and
leisurely refilled it he strolled down to
the open gates where the bale of egyptian
roots had been left by a muleteer and
smiled to himself at thought of his friend
   a rare man enough he mused  ex-
cept when the classics fasten on his tongue
he has no more of the parson about him
than i have lord knows thats little
enough at present
  he stood between the open gates and
looked out at the sea in sight over the
winding road a wistful hunger grew in
his eyes at sight of a speck of white far
out
   id like to be aboard her and heading
for boston town but here i am penniless
and dependent upon a consuls charity-
hello we have strangers among us it
seems
  coming toward him along the road were
two riders and the gray eyes of spence
dwelt curiously upon them he knew that
these must be new arrivals in algiers at-
tracted first by their remarkable costumes
it was their faces which finally drew the
keen interest of the american
  the man was robed in a burnoose of
snowy white against this about his neck
hung a most amazing thing-the glorious
collar of the golden fleece a jewel worn
by kings alone the woman beside him
wore a silken dress of apricot hue a huge
sun-hat shaded her head
  the mans face was or had been ex-
tremely handsome once it had been full
and rotund now it was thin and gaunt
lined with folds of empty skin half hidden
by a mustache and goatee of grayish black
suffering lay in that face and strange in-
ward pain
  the black eyes that blazed like jewels
held weird fires in their depths they fas-

cinated spence repelled him no common
man this who wore that collar of the
fleece a prince at the least
  the woman - well once she too had
been handsome her face was tired her
eyes weary in her gaze spence read
things that moved him to pity yet he knew
that he liked her
   following this pair well in the rear ap-
peared a company of horsemen in the gay
robes of moroccan moors spence did not
care to be spat upon as a christian and
was about to withdraw when he saw the
lady rein in her horse smiling at him
   he saluted sailor fashion and the horse-
man inclined his head slight as was that
gesture it was filled with a high courtesy
   good morning sir said the man in
english  you certainly have a superb
view here
   few compare with it was the quiet
reply of spence  only one can surpass
it-the view of ones own home shores
  the lady turned her face away as
though the words had burned her the
man looked at spence from those remark-
able eyes that flamed like living gems
  ah he said you are an english-
man
  i am from boston in america and
spence smiled  since i was born there
i take some pride in calling myself an
american
  the other plucked at his goatee a thin
smile in his jaded features
    i congratulate you sir who have found
for yourself a new country it argues well
for your capabilities i have made the ef-
fort more than once without success yet
men are accustomed to speak well of my
mental quality
   that could not remain in doubt said
spence  after a moment of converse with
you
  at this compliment the lady smiled
leaned over in her saddle and spoke under
her breath the horseman smiled again
yet in his eyes lay an indefinable torment
   i do not easily forget so kindly a
speech from so courteous a gentleman he
said  if you ever come into morocco
setior american pray consider me your
friend and debtor
  he inclined his head again and passed
on after them spurred the moors
  two or three officers of the algerian
garrison flung spence a word of greeting
so then that strange couple had come from
morocco a spaniard doubtless he had
said  sehor
  spence remained at the gate smoking
musing forgetting the bale of herbs in a
whole month no english ship had come to
set him on his way home again his own
stout boston ship had been crippled by
tunisian corsairs smashed by hurricanes
sunk
  his ship and all he owned were gone-
the savings of ten years swept away his
men were gone alone he had been picked
up by an english frigate and landed here
at algiers at thirty he was facing life
anew empty handed it galled him sorely
to depend on charity
  thanks to shaw and good edward hold-
en the consul patrick spence found al-
giers friendly for englishmen were highly
favored here yet how to get on home
again
  as he stood thus musing he was aware
of a man walking toward him he recog-
nized a moor who occupied the adjoining
villa which belonged to the dey of algiers
who he was spence had not the least idea
he was tall athletic of severely ascetic
features thinly bearded his eyes were
deep and somber
  as he came his gaze was fastened on
spence in one hand he carried a box of
leather a foot long six inches wide and
deep fastened with strips of brass
   i seek you he said abruptly  you
are el c a pit an spence
  from the mans face voice bearing
spence instantly knew that this was no
common man
   i am setior he answered in spanish
 may i offer you hospitality-
   there is no time the moor flung
a quick glance around then his eyes fast-
ened upon spence again  know you who
i am
   no setior
   i am mulai ali the idrisi-like your-
self a fugitive know you a man named
ripperda
down the coast of barbary

  spence shook his head a sardonic smile
touched the bearded lips of the moor
   then you are better off than i now
i know your story and i bring you a mes-
sage from the astrologer of arzew
   a message-for me spence did not
hide his astonishment
   aye i know what manner of man
you are from the stars i know that your
fate is twined with mine you are to be
trusted do you believe in the stars
   when they guide my ship yes said
spence  as arbiters of destiny-decided-
ly no
   but i do said the other  senor
the stars have linked us together do you
wish to make money-large sums
  spence eyed him shrewdly
   not enough to deny my religion
  the moor broke into a laugh
   ah i have no love for renegades now
listen i need a friend at once-one whom
i can trust if this box remains in my hands
an hour longer it spells my death
   when i was last at oran the astrologer
of arzew told me about you your fate
lies with mine you are the one man i can
trust if you will give me your help and
friendship i offer you three things of
money as much as you desire of power
more than you dream and for a wife the
most wonderful woman in the world
patrick spence thought he was dreaming
yet he would have been a poor seaman had
he not been able to think swiftly this
blunt speech this haste showed a crisis
he seized it
   i do not sell my friendship he an-
swered  either for money or power as
for a wife i desire none
  the moor stared at him
   you refuse my offer
   yes if my help will avail you i give
it freely-but i will not sell it
   by allah you are a man  the dark
eyes flashed suddenly  will you go to
morocco with me think well the stars
have promised me success perhaps your
friend dr shaw will go also yet death
may lie ahead will you go
  spence shrugged
   yes i will go
   good take this oox and guard it
and here is the message from the astrolo-
ger beware of a man who wears a black
burnoose adiosp
  mulai ali hastily thrust into spences
hands the box and a folded paper then
he turned abruptly and strode away at a
rapid pace unusual in a moor spence
stared after his figure in bewildered amaze-
ment then knocked out his pipe and pock-
eted it
   what the devil  he exclaimed whim-
sically  a man wearing the golden
fleece offers me hospitality in morocco
then comes this chap who seems to know
all about me and offers me a job and
whos this astrologer person
  he opened the paper and started eng-
lish characters met his eye
  to captain- spexce of boston
    mulai ali has told me of you as have
  others you may trust him absolutely i
  have persuaded him that you can help him-
  because i need your help i am a slave
     if he makes promises he can fulfill them
   teil the consul at algiers that i have woven
   a net to catch ripperda if you be the true
   man i think you then come with mulai ali
   and help me
  this note was unsigned
   ripperda who is the fellow mused
patrick spence frowning  and i am to
beware of a man who wears a black bur-
noose-plague take it all am i mad or
dreaming
  he filled his pipe again he had been
long enough in algiers to know that the
place was a hotbed of intrigue spanish
armies were holding oran against the moors
and the land was in turmoil it was not so
strange that he a christian should have
been picked on as trustworthy
  yet oddly enough he found his thoughts
dwelling not so much upon this astrologer
who was a slave nor upon the moor who
was a fugitive as upon that man who wore
the golden fleece he was surely some
great man-yet he craved a kind word a
compliment as a hungry dog craves a bone
who was he
  the sun went westering later came
thomas shaw to the villa again and with
him to spend the night the consul edward
holden

argosy-allstory weekly
  and they brought an explanation to pat-
rick spence-an amazing explanation
chapter ii
    hardy he was and wys to undertake
  with many a tempest hadde his berd ben
     shake
the three men after hearing spences
story sat drinking coffee and discuss-
ing it
   arzew said the divineis the ancient
arsenaria twenty miles east of oran since
the spanish siege the moorish provincial
government is located at arzew under a
proper turkish rascal named hassan bey
of this astrologer i never heard eh ned
holden shook his head
   zounds i wish i knew what net is
spread for that cursed ripperda
   but who is my man of the golden
fleece demanded patrick spence
   we come to that said dr shaw
 most men are mad upon some point you
upon ships i upon old ruins mulai ali
like many moors upon the stars this
mulai ali is of the idrisi blood moroccos
royal line his cousin is the sherif he
has been in hiding here-
   but my man of the golden fleece-
 ah that man patrick is more than
a little mad he landed this morning and
departs to-night because of his coming i
was so hastily summoned-all the consu-
lates are in turmoil unless he goes the
way of all flesh soon that man will set the
world by the ears-
 but who is he cried spence testily
   the politest man in europe born a
roman catholic baron of holland he be-
came a protestant in order to go to madrid
as ambassador at madrid he again shifted
religions and his allegiance likewise he
became a spaniard he destroyed alberoni
became a duke a minister then absolute
ruler of spain it was he the most astute
politician since richelieu who handled the
vienna treaty but regard the maggot of
madness in his brain patrick
    in a moment of reverse this man lost
his head he deserted his family fled with
a castilian girl and finally came to morocco
a fugitive again he changed his faith he
was made a pasha then prime minister of
morocco-and now rules that country as he
ruled spain his errand here is to form a
coalition of the barbary states against
christendom his name is william lewis de
ripperda
  spence started  ripperda what con-
nection has he with mulai ali then
  both men shook their heads
   we know not captain spence said
the consul  we do know that unless we
destroy ripperda this ripperda will de-
stroy spain and christendom his
ability-
  there was a knock at the door a slave
entered gave holden a low message
  holden looking astonished nodded into
the room came a cloaked and hooded figure
the man stood silent until the door had
closed then uncovered his face he was
mulai ali
   senores i must speak swiftly he
lifted a warning hand  you know rip-
perda is here
  the consul nodded in puzzled silence
the moor spoke with harsh driving energy
    captain spence has told you of the box
i gave him a month ago ripperda sent
me that box in it were things he obtained
through his agents in spain-documents re-
lating to the old moorish kings of seville
and granada certain of their relics and
copies of treaties which spain has made with
other nations
   knowing that i was of the idrisi blood
ripperda proposed to set me on the throne
of morocco by aid of these relics and my
own power and then to publish the spanish
treaties their publication would make
spain isolated hated by her neighbors dis-
trusted ripperda hopes to unite the bar-
bary states and egypt means to conquer
spain again for the moors-
    this is madness  exclaimed the consul
   the madness of a great man and a great
traitor now finding himself more secure
in morocco than he had thought the dog
has betrayed me i must flee or be slain
ripperda commands the moslem armies be-
fore oran the dey dare not offend him
do you wish to destroy this man rip-
perda
down the coast of barbary

  the consul frowned but dr shaw dis-
regarded the frown and spoke curtly
   yes
   then go to morocco with me by way of
tlemcen and the caravan route
  mulai ali spoke rapidly excitedly
   the dey will provide an escort i must
go to arzew in disguise and shall meet you
there hassan bey who commands at
arzew is my friend
   you are christians i can trust you
once at udjde over the moroccan frontier
i am safe the governor of udjde is my
kinsman and supports me all morocco
will rise for me the sherif abdallah is much
hated speak quickly will you go or
not
   i will go for one spoke up spence
eagerly  why do you wish our com-
pany
   because you are true men and through
you i can make treaties with england also
i need your advice and help if i win rip-
perda is overthrown 
   i will go said dr shaw quietly
   good to-morrow the dey will give
you safe conduct and an escort of spahis
i meet you at arzew if allah wills and
bring the casket and beware of a black
burnoose
  with a brief salute he turned and was
gone in haste
  the three men regarded one another in
silence spence was smiling the consul
frowned gravely dr shaw was lost in ab-
stracted thought
   zounds  said holden suddenly  this
is madness why do you go gentle-
men
   because i want to see the ruins and
roman remains in the west said dr shaw
 i shall find much of interest we must
carefully compare ptolemy and abulfeda as
we journey patrick besides we go the
errands of christendom if you want a bet-
ter reason
   and i said spence with a shrug  be-
cause my fortune drifts that way mr hol-
den i am curious about that astrologer of
arzew and i like this moor he is a real
man
  the consul laughed shortly  have your
own way pray heaven you bear luck with
you-this ripperda will menace all europe
if he be not pulled down 
  spence remembering that dark and tor-
mented man could well agree with such an
assertion
  the situation seethed with intrigue rip-
perda was the actual ruler of morocco
the dey of algiers now allied with him
was furtively helping mulai ali the dey
was a sly fox the spaniards were tightly
besieged in oran at sea the moorish
fleet was supreme under admiral perez
this renegade carthusian ripperdas one
actual friend in the world was a great
seaman
  it was typical of ripperda that he should
first intrigue to put mulai ali on the throne
then should turn against his puppet such
madness had already ruined ripperda in
two countries
  with morning the three men went into the
city holden and shaw set off to interview
the dey patrick spence and a consulate
guard went to the market to buy native
garments
  not far from the slave mart spence halted
before an open-fronted shop where an old
moor sat smoking a water pipe down
the narrow street surged natives soldiers
arrogant spahis and janissaries horses and
camel shouting and disputing the clamor
was deafening spence let the negro bar-
gain for the clothes he wanted
  suddenly he became aware of a man in a
black burnoose watching him remember-
ing the warning of mulai ali he turned
but the man was gone spence had a
memory of a twisted face that was marked
by a purplish birthmark about the right
eye
   devil take it muttered spence  ill
suspect every black burnoose unless i get
myself in hand that fellow was only
staring at a christian
  upon returning to the consulate he had
come within a few hundred feet of his des-
tination he was passing a low-arched door-
way carved with the hand which spells the
name of allah from the shadowed depths
two figures darted out plunged bodily upon
him spence fell backward the two men on
top of him as he fell he glimpsed that
twisted face with the birthmark

argosy-allstory weekly
  he crashed down a knife clashed on
the stone beside his ear but already his long
arms were busy he jerked one man over
his head heaved twisted himself he
pulled clear rolled over and leaped to his
feet in time to meet the rush of the man in
the black burnoose spence drove his fist
into the misshapen features and the man
reeled away
   at this instant the consulate negro dashed
 up scimitar bared a dozen other men con-
 verged on the scene the two assassins
 paused not but took to their heels with a
 crowd streaming after them two minutes
 later patrick spence was safe in the con-
 sulate
   he told dr shaw of the incident but the
 worthy divine related it to holden in the
 light of an attempted robbery shaw feared
 lest the consul forbid the journey as too
 dangerous and was taking no chances so
 the matter was passed off without great com-
 ment
   that night the safe conduct having been
provided dr shaw and patrick spence
packed up the consul provided them with
letters of credit upon a jew of mequinez
while shaw lingered lovingly over his rapier
maps and instruments-particularly the
latter
    this brass quadrant he discoursed  i
 had from mr professor bradley at wan-
 stead it is so well graduated that i can
 even distinguish the division upon the limb
 to at least one-twelfth part of a degree
 and this compass hati the needle well
 touched-
   the good divine seemed quite oblivious
to the fact that he was entering an almost
unknown land measuring wits against the
most unscrupulous man of the age yet
dr shaw as spence knew well was a
shrewd comrade reliable to the full and
quite able to use his sword as effectively as
his instruments
   at dawn spence wakened to the shrill
cries of muezzins lifting into the gray morn-
ing calling the faithful to prayer from
all around they came from the grand
mosque el khebir from the mosque of
hassan from the zaouia from the palace
mosque and others
   and in the courtyard the escort of twenty
spahis knelt at prayer their gorgeous uni-
forms glittering in the new sunlight
chapter iii
     he cheats the stare and they him and
   both cheat fools  tis all one to me
spence with the leather box sewn in
canvas and lashed at his saddle rode
westward with his friend and their es-
cort he was agreeably amazed by the
ease and comfort of their journey which
followed the chelif valley road to arzew
  under the auspices of the swaggering
spahis the guest house in each town was
commandeered in order to avoid the war
zone about oran- the route lay from arzew
to tlemcen thence to fez by the ancient
route of caravans and armies
  on the morning of the day they neared
arzew mulai ali joined them he rode
toward their party superbly mounted oo a
white arab bearing the cirde-bar brand of
the beni rashid tribe he was dressed in
the richest of pale green and pink silks
from the gold-twisted fillet at his brow to
the red moroccan boots he looked the chief-
tain he was alone
    well met seiiores
  he greeted spcnce and dr shaw in
spanish
    all is safe
    all is safe said spence knowing that
the query referred to the leather box
    you ride like a king said the divine
perplexed  yet we thought to find you in
danger and disguised what means it
mulai ali
  a good omen the moor laughed
 ripperda has not yet rejoined the army
before oran hassan bey has made me wel-
come at arzew before ripperda learns i
am there i shall be gone after leaving
arzew we must push hard for the south
   then said dr shaw  you aim to
enter morocco by the back door and seize
the throne while ripperda and the army lie
before oran
   exactly mulai ali lifted his hand
and pointed  here comes hassan bey to
meet you
arzew opened before them with its ex-
down the coast of barbary

tensive groves its rocky precipices its ruins
a dust cloud upon the road resolved itself
into a hundred horsemen headed by hassan
bey-a hard-fighting old turk whose wine-
frosted nose showed small regard for re-
ligious precepts
  with a great firing of guns and clamor
the parties met escorted by this guard of
honor spence and dr shaw entered the
town the bey had made ready quarters
for them in the kasbah or citadel and
received them with an entertainment that
was lavish the feast lasted far into the
night
  in the morning spence wakened to find
mulai ali present the moor and dr
shaw were engaged in a discussion of re-
ligious points which ended when the worthy
divine sallied forth to inspect the ruins and
make notes mulai ali remained while
spence broke his fast
   well asked the moor  and did you
see the man in the black burnoose
  spence looked up sharply and described
the attempted murder  who is the man
then
   his name is gholam mahmoud he
was once a janissary he is now one of rip-
perdas bodyguard of renegades we shall
probably find him ahead of us on the road
 h-m you seem little concerned said
spence with a shrewd glance
   the event is in the hands of god the
compassionate i saw the astrologer last
night and go this morning to receive my
horoscope 
   good this astrologer is a slave eh
an old man and english
  mulai ali smiled in a singular fashion
   yes captured by hassan from an eng-
lish ship and kept here secretly hassan
is afraid of the astrologer yet refuses to
sell the slave to me i have need of the
stars to guide me and should like to have
the slave in our company if possible
oh spence studied the other man
and chuckled  you will aid him to escape
then
   after i have eaten the salt of hassan
the moor gestured in dissent  i could
not do this of course a christian has no
scruples and might manage it
  spence broke into a laugh
   certainly i have no scruples let us
be frank mulai ali you want me to steal
this astrologer for you
   let us ask the stars about it said the
other evasively
  clearly the moor would not speak frank-
ly yet eagerness struggled against gloom in
his eyes the man was strongly tempted
thus to split hairs with his religious scruples
   i will attend to it said spence curtly
 when can we see the astrologer
   now a curious smile stole into the
bearded features you are ready
spence nodded rose and followed
  they descended to the kasbah courtyard
where their spahis and the garrison janis-
saries were fraternizing hence mulai ali
passed into the gardens adjoining the
guards saluting him respectfully they
came to a square commodious tower of
stone centered in a small grove of pome-
granates
  before the doorway of this tower squatted
a huge black eunueh half asleep across his
knees the glistening blade of a broad scimi-
tar sighting them he sprang up and sa-
luted mulai ali then loosened the bar of
the door and stood aside plainly mulai
ali had unquestioned access to hassans
astrologer
   after you senor said the moor
  spence found himself in a well-lighted
room hung with gorgeous stuffs upon a
stone stairway to the right appeared an old
hag who addressed them in spanish
   it is too early seitores-
   say that mulai ali the idrisi is here
spoke up the moor curtly  and with him
a christian who seeks guidance from the
stars hasten slave
  mumbling imprecations the hag scuttled
up the stairs in a moment she was back
again and beckoning them to follow
  they entered a chamber which had evi-
dently been long occupied by gentry of the
same profession a stuffed crocodile moth-
eaten and musty hung on wires from the
ceiling about the room were skulls stuffed
birds instruments inherited from the moors
of elder years
  above a curtained doorway hung a hand-
some pentacle of brass beside it was the
arabic nine-squared diagram the haraz al

mabarak-a very ornate piece of work in
wood the ciphers inlaid with silver
  the astrologer appeared suddenly before
them
  if he had stared before now spence
stared with twofold amazement no dod-
dering old man was this astrologer-no man
at all-but a woman wearing a white bur-
noose as he stared at her so she stared
at him her eyes wide dark eyes set in a
face that was suddenly white her hands
gripped the curtain beside her in a tense
grasp
   we are here senorita said mulai ali
courteously  i have told my friend cap-
tain spence that you are the most wonder-
ful woman in the world if my horoscope
is finished the fact will soon be proved to
his satisfaction
  the astrologer trembled slightly then
forced herself to speak
   i have it here-if you will be seated-
spence controlled himself to silence
bowed and seated himself
  upon him was dumb amazement as the
woman came forward woman nay but
a girl and no moor either but english
despite the suspense the emotion that had
gripped her she was now completely mis-
tress of herself and she was beautiful
spence realized not with the coldly perfect
lines of classic beauty but with character
that made for personality dark eyes dark
hair a sweetly girlish face-and an astrolo-
ger withal here was a marvel
   i have written it in castilian she was
saying giving mulai ali a scroll which
evidently held the horoscope  you may
study it at leisure-and it may be unpleas-
ant
   allah controls all said the moor im-
passively  will my enterprise succeed
 it may you are ruled by taurus
which augurs well though mars and scor-
pio have a strong influence tell me se-
nor if you abandon this enterprise you
will live long and happily a man of wealth
but holding no position or rank will you
abandon it
  a flash lighted the eyes of the moor
   and if i hold to it
   then you will not live long-ten years
at a venture they will be crowded with
great events wars conquests triumphs
your fortune will increase to the end you
will sit upon a throne but the end-ah
i know not the customs of your country
but it is cruel
  a harsh laugh broke from mulai ali
   but i know them well then-i have
to choose between a long life of obscurity
or a short life of greatness at the end of
which i shall be sawn asunder or burned
to death by the spaniards is that it
the girl inclined her head gravely
   that is it
   by allah ten years is enough for any
man i have chosen now senorita this
is the captain spence of whom we have
spoken speak quickly lest hassan sus-
pect that we remain overlong with you
the girl turned to spence her eyes
alight  you will help me she said
 i am english i was traveling to venice
with my father a student of astronomy
when the pirates captured me him they
killed-since then i have struggled against
disaster-
   madam i am wholly at your serv-
ice said spence quietly  your name
 elizabeth parks
   then mistress betty have no more
fear spence laughed with assumed light-
ness  you shall go with us into morocco
if that be possible can you trust any
here
   none she said her lips atremble
 there was talk of the beys harem-but
i knew enough of the stars to make him
fear me it was my only chance i man-
aged to avert danger-
   fear not said spcnce  we must
depart now but you shall hear from us
i take the responsibility on my own shoul-
ders mulai ali you agree
   very well
  the moor made a gesture
   you trust us seiiorila
  the girl smiled suddenly  have i not
read of you in the stars
  spence brought her fingers to his lips
and with smiling assurance departed her
eyes haunting him he followed mulai
ali to the garden then at a word walked
off among the trees and left the moor talk-
ing with the black eunuch
down the coast of barbary

  this amazing and unexpected meeting
had overwhelmed him he could realize
how this quick-witted and desperate girl
had seized one slim hope of escaping the
harem how she had worked upon the be-
sotted and superstitious hassan bey until
he feared her more than he desired her
   by heavens what a woman thought
spence
  he turned as the moor came toward
him
   well seiior what think you of the
bride i promised
    i do not steal brides mulai ali i help
her because she is a woman i desire no
wife however
   you might do worse said the other
 i have arranged with that eunuch her
sole guard he will leave her with us and
accompany us into morocco
   can you trust him
  the moor smiled
   he would rather be chief eunuch of a
sultans harem than a slave in arzew
  spence studied the moor
   you seem confident my friend yet
you have no army ripperdas assassins are
seeking you-
    allah rules all things who would dis-
pute the ways of god if a thing is or-
dained it will come to pass
   besides added mulai ali dryly  i
am not without friends do you fear to
accompany me who go alone to seek a
throne
   fear spence laughed and put out
his hand  luck be with you and my
aid
   good you and the astrologer must
leave here to-night and ride ahead we
follow in the morning-you must warn dr
shaw to be ready come and give your
orders
  he led the way to the courtyard sum-
moned two of the spahis and ordered them
to do as spence commanded the ameri-
can issued curt orders which the moor af-
firmed with a nod
   if the spahis were surprised they made
no comment their obedience to mulai ali
was implicit spence fancied that they
too looked forward to high commands in
el magrib when mulai ali won his venture
   if youll instruct that black eunuch
what to do said spence to the moor  you
may then leave all to me and dismiss the
affair as settled i know no arabic and i
fancy the eunuch has no spanish
  mulai ali nodded his assent and de-
parted
   spence returned to his quarters and wait-
ed until dr shaw returned then he in-
formed the divine as to their divided jour-
ney he said nothing about mistress bet-
ty not that he doubted the hearty co-
operation of his friend but shaw rather
fancied his character of envoy and would
be spared by ignorance a good deal of
worry
   you can leave early in the morning
doctor he concluded
   certainly i have carefully copied the
inscription on the hypogaeum and there is
little else to tempt me why are you thus
going ahead patrick i like it not
  spence chuckled  private affairs he
said cheerfully  hassan is giving a feast
to-night kindly make no remark upon my
disappearance but get off early in the
morning with mulai ali ride swiftly to
tlemcen well meet there believe me
it is better that you know nothing of my
errand just yet
   very well very well assented shaw
not without a sigh  but patrick if there
is anything forward that smacks of fight-
ing i pray you not to let my cloth prevent
me from having some share i am an ex-
cellent hand with the rapier as you
know-
  spence clapped him on the shoulder
   cheer up shaw i promise that youll
have fighting in plenty before you ever see
algiers again and now give me a spare
flint or two for my pistols and ill ask no
more

paid small heed to islamic prohibition

argosy-allstory weekly
further there vvei  entertainments by com-
panies of dancing women both of the town
and desert and by magicians of the aissoua
tribe an hour before midnight the scene
waxed riotous for hassan bey and his cap-
tains were roaring drunk
  it was then that patrick spence quietly
departed
  at his quarters he secured his few be-
longings cloaked himself in a dark bur-
noose and left the kasbah he entered the
gardens found the guards in drunken slum-
ber and encountered no one until he came
near the square tower of the astrologer
then a dark shape arose before him the
starlight glittered on a naked blade and he
recognized the distorted shape of yimnah
the eunuch
  spence threw back the cowl of his bur-
noose and the eunuch gestured toward the
tower a voice reached him
   captain spence thank heaven i
was afraid you could not get away-
   let us go at once mistress betty
may i have your hand
  he bowed over her hand guided her to
the waiting eunuch and led the way from
the gardens near the entrance he spoke
again to the girl quietly
   we must ride to tlemcem at once and
there meet mulai ali and our party do
you speak any arabic
   enough to get along with said the
girl quietly
  outside the kasbah in the shadow of its
high turreted walls the starlight shone on
the waiting spahis and horses from the
girl came a deep sigh of relaxation
 it seems a dream she murmured
 to leave thus unhindered unquestioned
 let us assign the honor to providence
and make the most of it said spence
 now mount quickly we must be far
from here when the muezzin mounts again
to the minaret
  the spahis brought up the horses
spence aided the girl into the high saddle
lashed behind her the small bundle she had
fetched adjusted her burnoose and sprang
to his own beast yimnah was already
mounted
  all five walked their horses from the
shadow of the citadel put the beasts at a
canter and swept away from the un walled
city to the southwest no common steeds
were these but blooded barbs the finest in
hassans stables calmly appropriated by
the spahis
   hour after hour through the night they
rode past the long sandy salt pits and the
lake of sibka through silent and dark vil-
lages along lonely wastes spence talked
with the girl as they rode telling his own
story and touching upon their errand
    it is a mad errand he concluded  yet
mulai ali is a kingly man and may suc-
ceed
    his horoscope truly reads him into a
throne said mistress betty  do not
laugh at me this business is not all char-
latanry although i have shamed the as-
tronomers art with my wiles i knew of
your presence in algiers through gossip
and set out to effect my rescue was that
selfish perhaps and yet-
    no not selfish it was wholly admir-
able exclaimed spence  we ride south
you are free mulai ali goes to friends and
a throne shaw goes to pull down ripperda
-and all by a womans wit i am humble
before you
   so they rode until the stars were paling
into the false dawn then one of the
spahis called softly in his own tongue
mistress betty heard the words and trans-
lated
    he says that some one is riding hard
on the road behind us
   spence drew rein
   forward no protest dear lady-for-
ward all of you
  the party swept on disappeared along
the dim road spence waited presently
he caught the hard beat of hoofs and sight-
ed a vague figure with a hail he sent his
beast out into the center of the road the
onsweeping rider uttered a sharp harsh
cry then a musket roared out and spence
heard the bullet as it whined past his
head
   his ready pistol made instant reply the
other horse plunged the rider fell headlong
and lay motionless spence dismounted
and fell to searching the man
  he was rewarded by a folded paper in
the knotted pouch-end of the worsted gir-
down the coast of barbary

die finding nothing more spence bound
the moor and left him
  he struck into a gallop after his own
party and within twenty minutes had come
up with them then not pausing he
pushed them on at all speed for time was
precious in the extreme
   when the true dawn glimmered into day-
light they halted beside a rivulet to water
and refresh the horses here spence in-
spected the paper he had captured it was
a note written in arabic and neither the
girl nor yimnah could read it so he called
in the spahis from their reading mis-
tress betty translated the note it was un-
signed and was addressed simply to gho-
lam mahmoud it read
    the hawk is at arzew and rides south
   catch him this side tjdjde or his talons will
   be plunged into el magrib slay him lay
   the snare at the cisterns with allahs help
   ah exclaimed mistress betty eager
ly  by  the hawk  is meant mulai ali-
this must be from a spy they know he is
coming the cisterns is a place west of
tlemcen on the highway
   and gholam mahmoud he of the
twisted face is ahead said spence
 well forewarned is forearmed how far
have we come
    nearly halfway she pointed ahead
 there is the mai la river beyond the
sharf el graab or raven crag-that high
pinnacle of rock at the river i shall show
you a famous place
   thankful that she seemed cheerful even
gay spence called to horse they rode on
   within ten minutes they halted at the
river ford here the high banks were gul-
lied to a depth of fifteen feet a dense
growth of trees concealednhe river and op-
posite bank the girl turned to spence
with a glow in her eyes pointing to the
sandy beach and ford
    i used to read in an old french book
she said  how when the spaniards were
catching the great pirate barbarossa they
pursued him to a river where he scattered
all his treasure hoping in that way to delay
them
 i even remember the words   lais-
soit couler de terns en tems de vor et de
vargent par le chetmrt this is the very
place where we are standing it was here
that he strewed his gold and silver-
  the words died suddenly on her lips
the spahis also had been speaking of bar-
barossa for this place was famous in le-
gend they were now silent staring
spence looked up swiftly
  a rough boisterous voice had risen ahead
-a voice that sang in reckless gayety a
spanish voice twanging out the vowels with
peasant whine some one was approaching
from the other side of the ford spence
looked at the spahis made a swift gesture
they wheeled their horses and vanished
among the trees
  the voice of the singer came closer the
eunuch yimnah baring his scimitar
slipped from fhe saddle and glided forward
to the masking trees then he was back
his thick lips chattering words of fear his
limbs trembling
   he says it is the ghost of barbarossa
said mistress betty
  spence chuckled
   wait here then
  his musket ready he urged the horse
forward into the gully here he waited
motionless looking at the man splashing
and singing as he made his way across the
shallows
  a big and burly man he was the ruf-
fianly face bore a spade beard and two
enormous mustaches all of flaming red
matching his long hair not until the horse
plunged at the bank did the man see spence
sitting there above him he clapped hand
to sword-a long blade at his hip spence
threw back his cowl and the man cried out
in surprise
  ha a christian
   no blustering setior said spence
sternly  your name and errand
  the glittering eyes drove to right and
left as the bushes crackled he saw that
he was ambushed and a sudden laugh burst
from his lips no moor this but a span-
iard
   well met caballero he cried jovially
 my name is lazaro de polan though in
some parts i am known as barbarroja i
am a soldier by trade can teach you tricks
with saber or espadon scimitar or brack-

argosy-allstory weekly
mard italian blade or rapier of toledo-
near which holy city is polan my birth-
place my errand is to seek employment
wherever it may be found
   you are a renegade queried spence
the glittering eyes flamed at him then
laughed
   ha i was captured by the moors
caballero saved my head by a less essen-
tial sacrifice became an officer in their
army and made enough money to pur-
chase my freedom i am now seeking serv-
ice as a guard or guide for i know all the
roads hire me caballero all the army
knows me and i can be of much service
to you
  spence regarded the man there were
many renegades and this barbarroja was
more than a mere braggart or he would not
be traveling alone in christian garb the
fellow could be useful in a dozen capacities
particularly if he were well known among
the moors
   done i am captain spence with safe
conduct from the dey of algiers journey
with us to tlemcen if you are no liar i
shall talk wages with you there is that
agreeable
  perfectly senor capitan barbarroja
gestured grandly in assent
   and i do not care to answer questions
   nor i to ask caballero
  with a shrug the renegade turned his
horse to the ford again
  spence called up his party on the far-
ther bank barbarroja waited his glittering
eyes scrutinizing them then he waved his
wide hat and set out in the van spence
sent the two spahis to bear the fellow com-
pany and rode beside mistress betty tell-
ing her how he had engaged the man to
his surprise the girl frowned thoughtfully
   there are evil men on the roads she
said  i misdoubt me that this rene-
gade-
  you fear him said spence then
i shall dismiss the fellow at once
   no no she said hastily  it would
be silly for there was no reason behind
my words doubtless he is as honest as an-
other and may be useful for he seems a
stout fellow
  so patrick spence thinking more of the
girl beside him than of the red-bearded
ruffian ahead rode on to the south and felt
well pleased with fate
chapter v
     wert theu the devil and worst it on thy
   hom it should be challenged
after nightfall the party rode into
tlemcen a great circuit cf ruins in-
closing a small walled space perched
disconsolately amid remnants of forgotten
kingdoms barbarroja undertook to lead
them to a quiet tavern where they would
meet no unpleasant questioning
  a cunning rogue was this and evidendy
known to the city guards whom he passed
with a friendly hail he led them through
filthy narrow streets and near the ruinous
mosque of el haloui knocked at a small
doorway a cautious wicket opened and
presently the door was swung ajar by a
greasy fellow whom spence took for a
levantine renegade
  the place proved decent enough for
mistress betty was secured in an upstairs
chamber a room opening from this with a
balcony overlooking the street served
spence and yimnah a third room sufficed
barbarroja and the spahis returning from
his inspection spence joined the party be-
low
  leaving the three men to unsaddle he
led the girl and yimnah up the narrow
stairs that ascended from the courtyard
the host waited at the head of the stairs to
light them
  as they came to the upper gallery en-
circling the courtyard mistress betty stum-
bled she caught the arm of spence to
save herself but the cowl of her burnoose
was jerked away revealing in the lantern-
light her features and in the shadows be-
hind their host spence caught sight of an-
other face turned upon them-a ghastly
face twisted awry with a purple birthmark
like a patch over the right eye
  a startled oath broke from spence he
dashed the greasy host aside and leaped for-
ward adroitly the levantine tripped him
as he fell he saw that face fade into the
darkness
                         	a
down the coast of barbary

  regaining his feet he hurled himself into
the obscurity from ahead he heard run-
ning feet then the slam of a door realiz-
ing that his pursuit was folly spence re-
turned to the levantine took the man by
the throat and shook him savagely
   lead me to that man gholam mah-
moudi he cried hoarse with anger
quickly
  the levantine blurted out that he knew
nothing of such a man there were many
in the tavern how should he know which
was meant he knew no such name mis-
tress betty who had caught up the fallen
lantern interposed
   we are in no position to seek trouble
captain spence i pray you let this matter
drop at least until our friends arrive
   spence released the host
  you are right he said yet that
man was watching us and saw your face
when you stumbled however let it be
   disposing the girl in her quarters spence
joined yimnah in the outer chamber and
wearily flung himself on his pallet
  he could swear that he had seen the face
of gholam mahmoud the confidential agent
of ripperda the man against whom mulai
ali had warned him spence knew he had
not erred as he thought of how those
distorted coldly lustful features had peered
at the face of mistress betty those preda-
tory and malignant features the american
gripped his nails into his palms with im-
potent rage but finally he slept
  in the thin grayness of morning spence
wakened to lie drowsily eyes half closed
the drone of yimnahs snores filled the
room through this drone pierced a thin
nasal cry from the minaret of the near-by
mosque  come ye to prayer come ye
to salvation devotion is better than
sleep-
   here am i at thy call oh god mut-
tered the eunuch and stirred to his prayers
  spence rose slipped on his shoes he
went to the balcony that overhung the
street opened the lattice and stepped out-
side for a breath of the morning air tipped
with mountain frost
  as he stood thus drinking deeply into
his lungs the keen air he heard the creak of
the tavern door from below he glanced
     a
idly downward wondering who was astir
at this hour of prayer he sighted a figure
-and started suddenly a black burnoose
as though drawn by the slight movement
above the figure looked upward from
spence broke a savage cry
  ha devil
  he was only ten feet above the street
level and unhesitatingly bestrode the bal-
cony the rotten wood crashed away be-
neath him yet he alighted on his feet and
flung himself at gholam mahmoud the
latter however had already taken warning
and was gone
  darting back into the doorway the man
slipped through and slammed the door in
the face of spence the american burst
it open ere it could be bolted and dashed
into the courtyard he saw the renegade
ahead of him leaping for the staircase
   sure of his prey spence gave no heed to
the men around but drove after gholam
mahmoud the latter reached the stairs
slightly in the lead took them two at a
leap near the top he hurled a pistol
under his arm the heavy weapon struck
spence in the breast and threw him out of
his stride for an instant
   aided by this respite the renegade gained
the gallery and took to his heels pursuer
and pursued were silent for death lay be-
tween them three strides in the lead
gholam mahmoud sprang into a doorway
slammed the door shot the bolt home
  with a curse spence gathered momentum
and hurled himself bodily at the wood
the door splintered visibly drawing back
he flung forward again with a rending
crash the door was carried off its hinges
and spence went staggering into the room
beyond he found it empty
  ahead spence descried another door
through which the renegade must have gone
he did not pause but flung himself bodily
at it and struck the door with all his weight
in the blow where he had expected re-
sistance he found none
   the door drove open lightly and freely
this unlooked-for give threw spence off bal-
ance sent him reeling into the room beyond
something struck him a crashing blow be-
hind the ear and he fell in a limp heap-
unaware even who had struck him

argosy-allstory weekly
  neatly taken on the wing barbar-
roja stepped forward viewed the senseless
figure complacently and twirled his im-
mense mustache  there was a proper
blow hold not so fast-
   he whirled suddenly caught the arm of
gholam mahmoud stayed the dagger thrust
meant for the unconscious spence
   the two men glared into each others eyes
for an instant
  he is mine snarled gholam mah-
moud
    not at all retorted barbarroja coolly
 he is mine and i am entirely ready to
enforce the claim with three inches of steel
in your ribs caballero i do not want the
fool killed just yet suit yourself whether
we are to talk profitably or to fight
   the other calmed himself by an effort
barbarroja released him
   now let us bind and gag him wrap
his head in a cloth and throw him in the
next room then we may talk in peace
   he is a devil snapped gholam mah-
moud
  the other twirled his mustache and
laughed
    i am something of a devil myself as
my master the sherif abdallah is aware
you and your master pasha ripperda are
devils twain but there are many ranks of
devils no less than of angels so look to
it now let us attend to him and then
have our talk
   spence disposed of barbarroja whirled
jauntily upon the sulky gholam mahmoud
   you have desired to see me i am
here my master the sherif is in fez
your master pasha ripperda is somewhere
up north like a lion on the prowl let us
talk and make history
  gholam mahmoud scowled stripped of
his black burnoose this white man with
the persian name showed himself to be a
bony man of huge strength his naked
arms were in full sight to an intelligent
eye one of those arms betrayed a terrible
and significant thing
   upon the right arm was boldly tattooed
the figure of a dolphin
   in that design showed the whole history
of the man-his birth education achieve-
ments his past and present to all the
moslem world this symbol spoke louder
than letters of gold
  it told that this man was bom a chris-
tian made captive in youth and educated in
the schools of the janissaries that so great
was his ability as to win place in thethirty-
first orta or cohort stationed around the
sultan this entire body were the picked
men of islam and upon the right arm of
each man was tattooed the insignia of their
cohort-the proudest token of the sultans
army the dolphin crest
  this man stood and scowled at barbar-
roja his twisted features malignant
   we might work together he said
 we have heard of each other i am on
business of my master ripperda you are
on business of the sherif does our business
lie with the same man
   it does affirmed barbarroja  your
ripperda has burned his fingers with mulai
ali eh and perhaps your master wants
to regain a certain little box of leather
at this gholam mahmoud started
   ah does the sherif know about that
casket
  barbarroja grinned
   no but i do what use informing the
sherif of everything i shall take the casket
to him-
   what you have it
   no no but i have it under my thumb
come let us be frank will your ripperda
pasha pay well for the casket caballero
i need money come speak frankly let
us join forces
   good said gholam mahmoud  my
orders are to kill mulai ali before he
reaches udjde and to regain the box of
leather ripperda will destroy mulai ali
utterly
   having changed his mind -barbarro-
ja chuckled- our affairs coincide cabal-
lero my master the sherif is particular
about keeping his seat on the throne so
then you wish to kill mulai ali because
ripperda has changed his mind i wish to
kill mulai ali because the sherif has not
changed his mind is that plain
   plain as your beard the other smiled
sourly  this captain spence-
   is my affair leave him to me bar-
barroja yawned  he will join mulai ali
down the coast of barbary

later perhaps to-night now shall we work
togetheror not
   yes said gholam mahmoud curtly
   and what gain we by this mutual good
will how bums your end of the candle
speak up
  gholam mahmoud smiled evilly  i
need no money i will take the woman in
your party
   oh dios de mi alma but i understand
now you wish her
   exactly who is she
   devil take me if i know since she is
not the wife of spence she must be the
daughter of shaw the english envoy well
take her if you like but where do i come
in by this door of good luck
   milk ripperda said gholam mah-
moud brusquely  kill mulai ali and the
others take the woman and the box let
my master ripperda ransom the box eh
money to you woman to me
   por dios it is agreed thundered bar-
barroja grandly  upon the word of a ca-
ballero how to do the work i have
the sherifs seal and no lack of men to obey
me do you set the trap and i will lead
the partridges into it
  thej- conferred together
  an hour later barbarrojastroed into the
other room humming a gay air he af-
fected to be seeking some lost article mut-
tering about it between snatches of his song
and cursing the moors for thieves he
stumbled over a prostrate form in the cor-
ner and swore
   here is another of the drunken dogs-
by the saints if these are not the boots of
the captain spence-holy mother the
valiant captain trussed and gagged like a
goose-
  witiua monstrous show ofsurprise he cut
spence loose his amazement was so un-
bounded that spence broke into a harsh
laugh as he rose
   did you never see a bound man before
fool listen have you seen a man here-
a man with a twisted face marked at birth
over the right eye
  aye redbeard scratched his nose
 i saw such a one half an hour ago-he was
just leaving the inn mounted on a good
horse too-
  spence swore perceiving that black bur-
noose had escaped him he hastened back
to the rooms he had quitted rubbing his
sore wrists and feeling anything but joyful
he found the canvas-covered box intact with
his saddlery
  it would not have pleased him to know
how barbarroja was laughing at the mo-
ment this redbeard much enjoyed his
little joke and fancied himself a fellow of
infinite wit a fancy which was destined to
work him some ill before long
chapter vi
    it will toast cheese and it will endure
   cold as another mans sword will
spence at once sent barbarroja and a
spahi on the back trail to meet dr
shaw he himself spent most of the
day resting or talking with mistress betty
he could not restrain his admiration for the
way in which she had controlled her fate
   her father had taught her to draw a horo-
scope with some skill when he spoke of
getting his own drawn however she laughed
and looked at him for a moment
 are you serious my dear captain
   middling so acknowledged spence
whimsically  if the future can be read-
 your future sir can better be read in
your face than in the stars-a future of
much calm strength of firmness of self-
mastery but tell me how long do we
remain here
   until we get word from shaw and mulai
ali we shall meet them outside town
we dare not linger here in tlemcen lest
messengers from hassan bey raise the pur-
suit after us and i have found that
gholam mahmoud has indeed been here
he said nothing of his misadventure lest
he alarm her but recounted what barbar-
roja had said about seeing the former janis-
sary the girl frowned over this
    we are in a strange vortex of intrigue
she mused  mulai ali if he reaches mo-
rocco can gain the throne the present
sherif is hated by the whole land for he is
a mere tool in the hand of ripperda this
renegade grandee of spain must be a snaky
sort of man

argosy-allstory weekly
    he has qualities admitted spence and
told of his meeting with the famous ripper-
da  from the note we captured we can
guess that this gholam mahmoud means to
assassinate mulai ali if possible i find
that from here we must go to udjde passing
the cisterns on the way we may have
trouble there but we shall have to see what
mulai ali decides
  it was afternoon when the messengers
returned barbarroja bowed grandly to the
girl twirled his mustache and delivered
himself of his report mulai ali and his
party were waiting outside the city for
spence the american turned to the girl
   how soon can you leave
   now smiling she reached for her
white burnoose
   then ill have the horses saddled at
once
  fifteen minutes later they rode out of
tlemcen by the north gate unquestioned
   for an hour they cantered easily through
a fertile champaign more than once meeting
parties of soldiery wild uncouth moun-
taineers of the west who exchanged a sulky
marhaba with barbarroja and passed on
at length they came to their companions
who were camped in a grove of trees beside
a rivulet
  dr shaw came forth to meet them anx-
iety and delight in his countenance laugh-
ing spence swung from the saddle and
then presented his astonished friend to mis-
tress betty
   dr shaw is entirely unaware of your
story he concluded so i shall leave him
with you for explanations while i speak
with our leader
  he swung off to join mulai ali look-
ing back he saw the divine helping mis-
tress betty to dismount and chuckled at
the expression on his friends face
  mulai ali was sucking at a water pipe
that bubbled and hissed like a lading camel
under a wide tree spence made a brief
report of their journey and handed over
the note which he had captured
  the somber eyes of mulai ali glowed
hotly at hearing of gholam mahmoud and
burned again as they read the note spence
lighted his pipe from the perfumed bowl
of the chibouk
   great is god and infinite god god
and god the compassionate exclaimed
mulai ali after a little silence  he or-
dereth all things the waysof men are plain
before him
   true enough said spence  i sup
pose you left arzew before our flight was
discovered
  mulai ali nodded
   although as allah knows i had noth-
ing to do with the escape of his astrologer
hassan will suspect and send after us we
must ride on we cannot avoid the cis-
terns if we are to reach udjde since we
cannot go back we must go forward
  the moor was silent again evidently
pondering some plan at length mulai ali
smiled
   here is the situation this accursed
gholam mahmoud will ambush me at the
cisterns being charged with my death
let him do it and allah upon him where
ripperda is no man knows he is like a
flea-he may be in tlemcen to-morrow
but the danger is directed against me you
and the others have nothing to fear the
ambush will not be set against you
    therefore all of you ride forward tak-
ing barbarroja and two of the spahis
ride to udjde the governor is my kins-
man and i will give you a letter to him
tell him that i shall remain at the cis-
terns awaiting help from him the spahis
will go with me following you slowly
there are ancient ruins at the cisterns and
we can easily defend ourselves there until
help comes from udjde you understand
spence nodded this plan assured mis-
tress betty a modicum of risk and suited
him well
    the leather box is safe
   yes will you not take and keep it
yourself now-
  l no the relics of the moorish kings
in that box will swing every chieftain in
morocco behind me the copies of secret
spanish treaties areinvaluable the casket
is safer with you the stars declare that
your fate and that of the astrologer are
bound up with mine it is evident that
allah who alone knoweth all things has so
ordained the matter
   very well spence nodded  write
down the coast of barbary

your letter and ill tell the others of the later he noted that barbarroja had lost
plan
  he rejoined dr shaw and the maid
wiiom he found seated beneath a tree in
earnest discussion they listened in si-
lence to mulai alis plan and shaw nodded
quick assent
    a good plan patrick it assures little
 risk to any of us we shall start at
 once
    then i shall go and thank mulai ali
for his kindness said the girl and rising
departed
  spence met the eyes of dr shaw and
smiled
    i suppose youre going to rake me over
the coals for my imprudence doctor
  tut tut patrick you did exactly
right my boy do you know she is a most
amazing young woman i was just ex-
pounding to her my theory in regard to
the enroclydon of saint pauls history as
opposed to the vulgate reading as you
know saint luke was present-
    my dear doctor intervened spence
 you must give me your views on that
point later at present you had best gird
up your loins and get ready our business
makes us set out at once and ride hard to
udjde suppose you get mulai alis let-
ter while i rouse the men
dr shaw sighed and obeyed placidly
   spence found barbarroja relating with
huge gusto horrible tales of the beni
snouss and other desert tribes through
whose country they must pass later the
credulous spahis listened agape swallowing
all his fancies spence angrily ordered him
to saddle up
    we are to ride ahead of the others
you will guide us two of the spahis go
also hasten 
   he turned to saddle his own horse and
did not observe that barbarroja gazed after
him with fallen jaw as though completely
taken aback by this information
  within twenty minutes the start was
made-spence and barbarroja leading
shaw and mistress betty following the two
spahis bringing up the rear with yimnah
the party would reach the cisterns some
time that night
   spence had no talk with dr shaw until
 his bold and jaunty air seemed silent and
 uneasy and often pawed his huge beard as
 though in deep thought nor did the man
 respond to conversation spence thought
 little of it
   at the halt for sunset prayer in which
 all save the three christians joined dr
 shaw drew his horse alongside that of
 spence
    patrick i am told by mistress eliza-
 beth that when you engaged this ruffianly
 red-beard you told him you would discuss
 wages with him at tlemcen what agree-
 ment reached you
    eh why none i forgot it
   shaw shook his head
    that looks bad my son if the man
 were what he seemed-well well let be
 i gather that we reach the cisterns to-night
 and halt until morning
    no halts said spence curtly  we
 must save mulai alis neck and that means
 hard riding its only fifty miles to udjde
 our horses are in good condition and we
 must push on
    but stop a few moments at the cis-
 terns pleaded the doctor anxiously  i
 have heard of notable inscriptions there
 on a pillar near the wells the moon will
 be at the full to-night and i can copy it in
 a few moments
   smiling spence agreed so small a boon
 which meant so much to shaw could not be
 denied
   after the prayer and a brief repast they
 went on again at a brisk pace an hour
 after nightfall the moon rose full and glo-
 rious lightening all the cold countryside
 with silver brilliance muffled against the
 cold the party pressed their horses vigor-
 ously
   it lacked an hour of midnight when they
 approached el joube or the cisterns
   there was no native village here only a
 bleak hillside covered with ancient ruins
 where two brackish wells supplied water for
 travelers the moon was at her zenith
 the place with its white marbles and
 broken columns and jackals howling afar
 was the very epitome of desolation spence
 sighed in relief when he saw that the camp-
 ing ground was empty evidently they

argosy-allstory weekly
were ahead of any ambush mulai ali
might have come with them after all
   no unsaddling ordered spence
 we stop for food and water then on
again may i spread cloaks on the ground
for you mistress betty
  shaw forgetting all else was already
scrambling away amid the ruins
   spence laid out his burnoose for the girl
fed his horse and joined her with dates
and couscous presently he lighted his
pipe and was getting it to draw when he
heard the voice of shaw from the tumbled
ruins excitement in its tone
   patrick come here at once and see
what i have found
  laughing spence essayed to find the
divine this was no small matter but
after circling a huge cistern and stumbling
over heaps of ruins he came upon shaw
the latter was seated before a broken pil-
lar notebook in one hand sword in other
with the rapier he was scratching lichens
from an inscription-the use to which he
most often put the weapon dr shaw
looked up excitedly
   patrick let me read you this re-
markable inscription
 q pompeio cn f qvirit clementi
pa-diiyr ex testamento
q pompeio f qvir rogati fratris sui
pompeia a p mabra posvit
   does that suggest nothing to you pat-
rick does it betray no significance
spence laughed  only that somebody
wasted a lot of time whats the big find
doctor
   man man do you not realize that
this broken inscription refers to the grand-
son and great-grandson of pompey him-
self finding them buried here beneath
us what a force and beauty are lent to the
sublime epigram of martial think of
them being entombed here
   im cold said the practical spence
 im thinking a lot more of ourselves than
of pompeys family if youve finished
copying those letters suppose we move on
    i forgot
  the other rose
   patrick i saw some men watching me
rom behind those stones-i said nothing
of it lest they interrupt before i had copied
the words
   spence stifled a curse
    come along then weve done enough
talking-hello whos this
   a swaggering figure approached them at
this instant it was barbarroja one hand
at his hilt the other twirling his mustaches
beyond spence saw that mistress betty
and the others were already mounting
yimnah was lying down drinking from the
well
    a word with you senores exclaimed
barbarroja  i have an offer to make
you
  confound you snapped spence
 what are you talking about
   why truce terms capitulation
armistice in a word peace or war
  are you mad demanded dr shaw
peering at the renegade barbarroja
chuckled
   not quite senor listen there is a
company of men hidden here at a call
from me they will attack now let us
speak together-terms my friend who
captains those hidden men desires the per-
son of the lady yonder now how much
is she worth to you a word and i can
get you away from here without molesta-
tion
   villain cried dr shaw and hurled
himself forward
   so unexpected was his attack that bar-
barroja was taken unawares the amazed
spence saw his companion tw ine both hands
in the flaming beard and jerk the ruffian
forward a wild howl of pain broke from
the renegade to be quenched in a groan as
the lusty divine kicked him amidships and
stretched him senseless on the stones
   thats the way to deal with such
gentry  panted shaw  now to horse
patrick
   from the spahis broke a shout of warn-
ing a spattering of musket fire leaped
from the hillside men shouted a ring of
dark figures appeared closing on the party
spence and dr shaw ran forward trying
to gain the horses
    ride shaw shouted spence  ride
with mistress betty and send aid theyve
got us
down the coast of barbary

  the ring of figures closed in upon them
steel flashed in the moonlight
chapter vii
     an honest fellow enough and one that
  loves quails
the shots set the blooded sensitive
horses to plunging madly one of
the spahis caught the bridle of mis-
tress betty and spurred away with her the
other his horse slain leaped into the empty
saddle of barbarroja and galloped after his
comrade
  shaw was mounted but two men were
stabbing at him a third had gripped his
bridle rein yimnah was caught afoot
spence missed his horse which shied away
the two beasts were careering madly around
headed from the road and finding no out-
let from the ruins
  spence cut down the first man who
sprang at him and shouted again at the
divine
   spur for it shaw after her spur
   he who takes the sword quoth the
doctor neatly putting his rapier through
one of his assailants  shall even perish by
the same and the thin blade split the
throat of the man at his rein  farewell
patrick woe is me that i must leave
you
  his voice was lost as he thundered away
  spence conjectured that a score of men
must have fallen upon them he himself
was ringed in against a block of marble
which secured his back he pistoled two
of the men before him seized his sword
again and they recoiled momentarily from
his attack
  a wide blade flamed in the moonlight
the hoarse inarticulate rage scream of
yimnah rent the night like a pasan of hor-
ror the monstrous figure of the eunuch
streaming blood from a dozen wounds
rushed through the assailants striking to
right and left in blind fury they opened
before him fell back from spence shrieked
that this was no man but some jinni of
the mountains yimnah leaped on them
struck and struck again screaming
    fools  cracked out a voice in spanish
  a musket flashed near the voice there
died yimnah the wide blade sweeping out
from his hand and clashing on the stones
  at this instant spence leaped out sud-
denly as one of the horses plunged past he
caught the beast in mid-career dragged
himself into the high saddle that harsh
crackling voice electrified him it was the
voice of gholam mahmoud now he per-
ceived the mans figure off to one side and
directed the plunging horse toward it
  assassin he shouted this time
you shall not escape
  another musket shot rang out spence
felt a shock-and darkness came upon him
he bowed forward his body supported by
the huge moorish saddle his fingers twined
into the mane of the horse the frantic
beast dashed away into the night with
whirlwind hoofs
  gholam mahmoud leaped forward rav-
ing like a maniac to insure against dis-
covery of the ambush his horses had been
left a quarter mile distant pursuit was im-
possible while gholam mahmoud cursed
barbarroja came groaning to the scene
holding his hurt stomach
   ha thou bitch wolfs fool cried the
furious red-beard  why did you not
await the signal
   you were too cursed long in giving it
snarled gholam mahmoud  now the
woman is gone
   a murrain on you and your woman
shouted barbarroja  now spence is es-
caped and mulai ali not come pot-head
that you are-only one eunuch bagged and
half our men down
   devil take you get the horses and after
them 
   after them yourself growled barbar-
roja  i stay here to kill mulai ali when
he comes
  ten minutes later gholam mahmoud
rode away toward udjde-alone
  when patrick spence came to his senses
his horse was following a cattle track in a
long and narrow valley where he was
spence had not the least idea he was com-
pletely lost he had caught his own horse
and behind the saddle were provisions
water-skin and the covered box belonging
to mulai ali

argosy-allstory weekly
   for a space he rode confusedly until a
 twinge of pain recalled him to memory
 he drew rein found himself bareheaded
 and discovered a slight wound along the
 scalp above his left ear he made shift to
 wash the wound with water from his bottle
   the devil he exclaimed suddenly
 realization smote him full force left him
 appalled and bewildered why barbar-
 roja must have been in league with gholam
 mahmoud all the time he must have ex-
 pected to lead mulai ali into that ambush
 and too must have had some share in
 gholam mahmouds work in tlemcen
    and i never suspected when he found
 me trussed up and appeared so amazed
 thought spence dumfounded  well
 master red-beard just wait a bit ill
 have a wrord with you in time
   presumably shaw and the girl had es-
 caped with the spahis they would reach
 udjde and send help to mulai ali thus
 the assassins had gained nothing and
 spence considered his own case as he rode
 onward again
   he was lost sure enough so far as he
 could tell he was among a series of long
 barren hills the valley stretched intermin-
 ably and seemed uninhabited yet he
 knew that this cattle track must lead some-
 where he let the horse take its head
   the hours dragged until the moonlight
 was gone still spence perceived no sign
 of life among the bare hills with dark-
 ness he halted hobbled the horse and lay
 down to sleep until dawn hopeless of wan-
 dering on through the obscurity
   with dawn he found the horse muzzling
 him for food stiffly he gained his saddle
 and sent the arab onward as the sun
 rose to warm them spence noticed that the
 beast quickened its pace ten minutes later
 he made out a low group of trees and the
 dull walls of a mud-thatched building in an
 elbow of the valley
   renewing the priming of his musket he
 rode forward not until he drew near the
 trees and shouted did he discern any sign
 of life then a misshapen old man came
 forth from the hut and peered at him chat-
 tering arabic volubly
    do you speak spanish demanded
 spence  or english
  the hunchback started and drew back
 be you an englishman sir he quav-
ered
   eh spence started  youre not
 god love ye sir god love ye broke
out the ancient  out o the stirrup and
welcome to ye its two year and more
since ive had a bit of english speech a
bonny bit o flesh under ye sir god love
ye what a bonny creature it is
   youre english said the astonished
spence as he dismounted  i need feed
for the horse more than for myself
   god love ye an honest man thinks for
his beastie first come in and lead the horse
after ye sir tis like entertaining a prince
to have a horse o that blood under my
roof true njed quarter strain ill war-
rant come in sir and welcome
  feeling as though in a dream spence
entered the hut a clean place where the
old man dwelt alone a queer chap this
hunchback with his wisps of gray hair his
tattered garb his bleary old eyes and pal-
sied hands
  his name the man would not tell but
he chattered out his story indeed his
thought was all for the horse rather than
for spence a cutpurse in bristol he had
been jailed taken into the navy with other
criminals and was aboard a sloop captured
by algerines for thirty years he had been
a slave a natural liking for horses had
made him the manager of an oudying herd
of the animals which were bred hereabouts
    fifteen hands and full o the haunches
he mumbled lovingly stroking the arabs
coat  god love ye didst ever see a finer
slope o the shoulder than this and sad-
dle-backed just the touch o wiry springs
no weakness what a head it is now what
a taper down from the brows god love ye
sir this beastie could drink from a pint pot
and to spare and the legs twisted wi
sinew but clean as a whistle and the ear
like a thorn-god love ye this beastie must
be out o the beys stables at arzew not
the dey himself has a horse o njed strain
but hassan had two o them ye baint a
slave on the escape sir
  spence laughed
   no youre right about the horse
granther its from the beys stable 
down the coast of barbary

   he told briefly that he had been attacked
by robbers at the cisterns and was lost
the ancient mumbled in amazement but
answered spences queries as to his road to
udjde
   the cisterns god love ye its far
away from here follow the vale and twill
bring ye out on the river a few mile ahead
there yell find the river road from udjde
to the sea coast turn south to udjde or
north to adjerud a tiny bit of a port that
the moors use
    for a fine gentleman like you tis no
journey at all sunset will see ye safe with
lackeys and servants and sojers too belike
god love ye sir tis no ride at all now
wait ye here till i get some fresh tomatoes
from the garden-
   the ancient shuffled away
  within an hour spence had breakfasted
and mounted again spence forced money
on the old man and with a final  god
love ye ringing in his ears he rode away
down the valley
   a grotesque blessing yet why not
he reflected  ive met worse hospitality
in christian lands god rest you old man
renegade or not
  he saw no living creature on his way
though mile after mile slipped past udjde
he knew was fifty miles from the coast
the  river road  was doubtless one that
ran north to the port of adjerud for the
maritime moors were not fond of being cut
off from the sea
   shortly after noon spence found that the
valley was insensibly disappearing and
presently saw a river line of trees in the dis-
tance in no long while he came to a wide
but shallow stream crossed it easily and
on the farther side found himself actually
upon the road of which the old hunchback
had told him
  he noted too a cloud of dust coming
toward him from the north betokening
other riders on the road to udjde since
he had a straight story to tell and naught to
fear he waited meaning to join them and
ask protection as feu as udjde he per-
ceived that no caravan was approaching
but a group of horsemen perhaps a detach-
ment going to join the army
  then as he watched the curiosity of
 spence changed to incredulous amazement
 here were a score of horsemen brilliantly
 garbed and amid the foremost rode one
 clad in a plain white burnoose against
 this white burnoose at the throat was a
 glitter-there could be only one man in all
 the world with the effrontery to display the
 collar of the golden fleece against the garb
 of a renegade
   it was ripperda beyond question rip-
 perda and with him his bodyguard of rene-
 gades-and riding to udjde
 chapter viii
    ill learn to conjure and raise devils but
    ill see some issue of my spiteful execrations
 i voctor shaw did not regain control
 i  of his terrified horse until he pounded
 up alongside the two spahis who held
 between them the reins of mistress betty
   vainly had she ordered them to return
 and fight vainly threatened them vainly
 entreating them all but swearing at them in
 an agony of supplication they dour
 bearded turks shrugged their shoulders and
 pricked westward so when shaw came up
 with the three and the girl saw that he was
 alone she turned upon him fiercely
    where is captain spence
    when i left he was still fitting
   the divine gave no explanation of his de-
 sertion
  oh cried the girl oh-coward
that you are to leave him shame upon
you
   the spahis grinned in the moonlight
 they did not understand the words but
 had no need to shaw who still carried his
 naked rapier in his hand wiped and
 sheathed it
     my dear madam he said the cool stiff-
 ness of his voice giving no hint of the tears
 that were upon his cheeks  patrick spence
 is very dear to me but it is i who bear
 the letter to the governor of udjde it is i
 who am charged with a commission involv-
 ing the fate of empires and of religions-
    and you save your craven neck for
 that reason burst forth the girl bitterly
     even so and it pleases you rejoined
 shaws emotional voice  unless i reach

argosy-allstory weekly
udjde our friend mulai ali falls into a trap
back yonder and receives no aid in this
event pasha ripperda remains sole ruler of
morocco in such case the barbary states
combine against spain who will be alienated
from her allies and the moors will begin a
holy war for the reconquest of the peninsula
it is very logical that-
  a murrain on your logic snapped
mistress betty  patrick spence is worth
more than all your tine plans and schemes 
 so speaks the woman mulier saeva
reflected dr shaw  the cruel woman
who recks empire less than the little finger
of a man truly sa-s clemens alexan-
drinus that-
  his voice ended however in a choked
silence and a gulp here perhaps mistress
betty perceived that in him was a greater
tenderness than appeared and guessed that
his desertion of spence might have other
reason than cowardice or logic for after
this she rode on in silence
  they rode into uujjfe in the morning with
a great and haughty shouting on the part of
the spahis and demands to see the amel
immediately udjde amid its wide orchards
and olive groves the most fertile oasis in
ali the xagad steppe opened itself to them
by way of the bab el khemis
  amid a continually growing concourse of
horsemen curious townfolk and men of the
famed barbary tribes they rode to the kas-
in the south quarter of the town
rty minutes later a hundred men of the
ancient lamta tribe were spurring madly
eastward along the caravan road to the
cisterns
  dr shaw found himself and mistress
betty given commodious quarters in the
citadel and hospitably entertained by the
amel or governor-an old hoary moor who
had managed to live long by dint of guile
and not too high ambitions
  during most of the day the worthy doc-
tor rested toward evening he was sum-
moned to dine with the governor with word
that news of mulai ali was expected at any
time mistress betty being a woman was
forced to remain in her own apartment with
the female slaves allotted her
  garbed in clean linen shaw was con-
ducted to the private quarters of the gov-
ernor whom he found alone while a
bountiful repast was served the two fell to
discussing affairs in morocco the governor
was certain that once mulai ali could get
into the country his star would quickly blaze
above that of his cousin abdallah
   all men turn to the new master he
said sagely stroking his white beard with
his left hand while his right plunged into
the food  el magrib is ripe for revolt-
but abdallah is strong and stronger yet is
ripperda in whose hands is the power
   if mulai ali comes will you declare for
him asked shaw
   yes and my warriors will ride to fez
with him know you who that renegade
was-him with the red beard whom you
called barbarroja
  shaw shook his head the old governor
chuckled as at a good jest
   he serves the sherif abdallah and car-
ries with him the royal signet and the
other of whom you told me this morning
the man in the black burnoose gholam
mahmoud is the agent of pasha ripperda
he he xo wonder those twain laid in
ambush for mulai ali 
  before shaw could reply to this disclosure
-indeed for a moment he sat agape at
hearing the truth about barbarroja-a slave
hurriedly entered and knelt in his hands
was a pigeon which he presented to his
master knowing that the force sent to the
cisterns had taken carrier pigeons the
quicker to inform the governor of what took
place there shaw leaned forward anxiously
as a tiny roll was taken from beneath the
birds wring
  the old moor opened it read a scrawl
of arabic and turned pale
   god god and god the compassionate
the merciful he ejaculated this is
from a friend in adjerud it warns me that
pasha ripperda is on his way here with his
bodyguard of renegades he should arrive
to-morrow
  shaw gave a start
   ripperda-with his bodyguard xo
troops
  the old moor shook his head he was
extremely agitated the very fact of rip-
perdas coming had thrown him into con-
sternation
down the coast of barbary

  at this instant a second slave dashed in
and presented a second bird with trem-
bling fingers the governor detached the mis-
sive he read it then crumpled the thin
paper in his hand and sat staring before
him like a man who sees utter disaster
ahead in reality his fertile old brain was
scheming and planning but shaw did not
know this
   what is it demanded the divine eager-
ly  news from mulai ali
  for a long moment the moor made no re-
sponse he stared straight before him as
though the question had been unheard
shaw unable to bear the suspense reached
out for the paper but the moor hastily tore
it across
   catch ripperda when he comes ex-
claimed dr shaw swiftly  you see your
chance catch him at the city gates cap-
ture him raise the flag of mulai ali-
   the old moor turned lifted his head re-
garded shaw- steadily
   ali he said slowly  is dead the
red-beard has done his work the troops
reached the place too late-ali had been
stricken by a bullet
  shaw quivered under the blow then
silently he resumed his seat and folded his
hands on the table mulai ali dead
everything was lost he did not observe
that while speaking the eyelids of the moor
had fluttered slightly-an involuntary low-
ering of the lids which is natures signal of
a lie issuing from the lips
  swiftly the governor clapped his hands
a slave brought writing materials and the
old moor dashed off several notes which he
sealed and dispatched then the captain
of the troops a splendid berber of the hills
strode in and received rapid orders
   the pasha ripperda arrives to-morrow
prepare rooms in the citadel for his use in
the name of allah greet him as one who is
the right hand of our lord the sherif
  again the two men were alone the old
governor turned to shaw with a quiet ges-
ture
   you have eaten my salt i cannot pro-
tect you against ripperda what wish you
to do
  dr shaw had gathered his wits by this
time and his brain was working shrewdly
   my friend spence was not mentioned in
that message then let us hope that he is
alive i shall remain here ripperda will
not harm us for i have a nominal errand
to the sherif-regardless of his name and
i must await news of my friend also we
shall remain here
  the moor nodded his eyes were nar-
rowed in calculation anxiety sat beneath
the lids
   may allah further your undertakings
i have my own head to look after
  dr shaw took the hint rose and de-
parted to tell mistress betty his news
  in another portion of this town was a
house outwardly inconspicuous inwardly
a mass of sumptuous furnishings many
slaves were here white and black the
harem was large
  in a small room sat the master of this
house upon a thick rug before a writing
table such as scribes use a tiny shaded
lamp burned before him his face was in-
visible only his sinewy arms showing in the
circle of light he clapped his hands and
a slave entered
   when a man comes showing the signet
of the sherif bring him to me at once
alone again the man went on writing
as his right arm moved in the light one
could see a design upon the skin-the figure
of a dolphin tattooed there this man was
gholam mahmoud
  suddenly almost without a sound the
door opened a man clad in a dark bur-
noose came into the room he threw back
the hood and disclosed the flaming beard of
barbarroja a weary oath broke from him
as he sank down on the rug
   diantre get me some wine i had
to shout for half an hour before they would
open the city gates-even the signet of the
sherif barely satisfied the dogs allah upon
them i rode my horse to death and walked
the last two miles of the way here
  a slave brought wine barbarroja twice
drained a goblet then sighed contentedly
   you should have stayed with me he
grinned at his host  you lost money ca-
ballero that is what comes of running
after women as it is the reward is mine
 reward gholam mahmoud started
 then-mulai ali-

argosy-allstory weekly
  is dead
 barbarroja twirled his mustache grandly
  i do not say it was well done nor am
 i proud of the matter however allah
 knows i need the money his spahis
 fought off my men and while they fought
 i gained place in the rear-and put a bullet
 in his back
    where is his head then sneered the
 other
    bah the event will prove my words
 any news of the man spence
    none he is lost the others reached
 here safely why are you interested in
 him
    because said barbarroja coolly  i
 have just learned that spence carries the
 leather box behind his saddle that makes
 you jump eh well it is the truth rip-
 perdas casket 
   gholam mahmoud snapped out an oath
 then  have you any scheme any way to
 find him
   barbarroja chuckled
    spence cannot go far alone and dare
 not go back to tlemcen so he must come
 west in that event he will be picked up
 somewhere in this district we have only
 to wait until he is brought to the governor
 when he comes we take the casket-and
 you negotiate its sale to your master rip-
 perda you comprehend it is simple
 gholam mahmoud smiled his twisted
 smile
    and suppose pasha ripperda comes
 here
    let him come barbarroja shrugged
 but his eye was startled  do you expect
 him
    perhaps to-night certainly to-morrow
    dios very well
   the spaniard made a grandiloquent ges-
 ture
    i am a generous man i shall allow you
 to share the credit of killing mulai ali
 tell the pasha we did it together the
 sheriffs reward goes to me however this
 will rehabilitate your credit with ripperda
 who will then gladly pay a big sum for the
 casket you understand
   gholam mahmoud regarded him sneer-
 ingly for a moment
    i understand that in all this there is
 no mention of the woman whom i desire
 if we are to work together let the condi-
 tions be fulfilled-or i shall obtain the wo-
 man for myself if you want the money
 turn over the woman to me and do it quick-
 ly she is here now
   barbarroja pawed at his great beard and
considered this demand
   agreed he said and yawned  you
shall have her to-morrow give me a place
to sleep caballero and allah will bring all
things to pass
  gholam mahmoud himself conducted his
guest to a room on the upper floor
  once alone barbarroja did not sleep
though he was worn and haggard instead
he sat for a while staring into the lantern
and plucking at his huge beard he was
sore put to it
   they will all be warned against me
now since that old goat of a governor
knows me all too well he reflected  and
the governor will avenge the death of mulai
ali on me if he catches me how then
shall i get the woman for yonder lecherous
viper get her i must
  if that devil of a spence returns-ha
old shaw is the one to work upon and i
owe him a turn for the sorry trick he played
me at the cisterns shaw is the one-and
it must be done speedily before ripperda
comes before that devil spence turns up
to-morrow early
   he sat for a while longer then blew out
the lantern presently his chuckles died
away into a droning snore
chapter ix
     sword is an oath and oaths must have
   their course
an hour after sunrise dr shaw hastily
 sought the presence of the governor
 sleep is a trusty adviser he
said  i have changed my mind over-
night and have decided to leave here at
once before ripperda shall arrive
   god knoweth all things the old
moor blinked  consider me at your
command what wish you
    nothing said shaw  i will take the
two spahis who brought me here and go on
down the coast of barbary

to fez i have obtained a guide give
me a spare horse food and water-skins
the old moor blinked again he smelled
something amiss since this was not the
proper state for an envoy but he was
mightily glad to be rid of shaw who might
interfere with his own artistic lies to rip-
perda and refused to inquire too close into
shaws purpose
  nor did he fail to note the inward agi-
tation of shaw putting one thing with
another he shrewdly guessed that this agi-
tation was connected with the missing
spence all his solicitude was for his own
hoary head however so he sped his guests
right courteously
  half an hour later dr shaw and mis-
tress betty attended by the two spahis
rode toward the western gate of the city
with shaw in front was a rascally one-
eyed moor he was not only the guide
but the cause of their precipitate departure
   you are certain you know the place
said dr shaw to the moor
   aye infidel growled the guide  it
is the tomb of osman half a mile from the
city gates-a deserted spot since the tomb
has fallen into ruin
  shaw drew back beside the girl who
watched him with anxious eyes
   i think it is all right he said  at
least it tallies with spences note and we
must trust the rascal let me study that
note again mistress
  the girl handed him a paper which he
read over as he rode it was a note in
english signed by spence telling shaw to
meet him outside the western gate at the
tomb of osman and to make no delay
spence stated that he was slightly wound-
ed had no horse and dared not enter the
city that mulai ali was dead and all their
hopes gone all this tallied only too well
with what shaw himself knew
  as they neared the western gate there
came to them a distant sound of gunfire
and a faint clamor of shouts shaw gave
the girl a whimsical smile this noise was
the welcome to ripperda who was at that
moment entering the city by the northern
gate
  the gate behind them the party rode to-
ward the orchards and groves beyond the
city the spahis were ahead the guide
between them shaw and mistress betty
followed with the lead horse in this order
they entered the rich champaign and saw
the city walls vanish
the timeliness of this departure and the
expected meeting with spence put dr
shaw into high good humor his anxieties
disappeared and he discussed with the girl
whether they should strike on for fez or
return to algiers in the midst of this
cogitation the guide called back to inform
him that the tomb of osman lay ahead
this was the ruined tomb of some an-
cient marabout as the domed building tes-
tified a desolate garden surrounded the
place which was in ruinous disrepair
there was no sign of spence to be seen and
shaw strove to dissipate the uneasiness of
his companion
   he may be sleeping somewhere near
by he said reassuringly  at least we
can wait
   they drew near and passed beneath the
western wall of the old tomb where there
was shade from the morning sunlight
shaw dismounted and gave his hand to the
girl to help her from the saddle
   at this instant the trap was sprung
   the guide with one lightning movement
plunged his long knife into the side of the
nearest spahi then put spurs to his horse
the second spahi whipped out his scimitar
and from the near-by trees came a ragged
blast of muskets pierced by two bullets
the spahi fell beside his dying comrade
   three men came running from the trees
joining the treacherous guide
   so swiftly had all this taken place that
both shaw and the girl stood motionless
paralyzed by the rapid horror then as
the assassins ran forward a cry broke from
shaw
    barbarroja
   red-beard it was brandishing his sword
who led the other ruffians he came to a
halt and grinned widely at shaw while his
men seized the horses and plundered the
dead spahis
    sehor i greet you behold am i not
a pretty writer of notes it is not spence
 scoundrel cried the doctor in a stran-
gled voice  you have deceived us

argosy-allstory weekly
   decoyed you into a pretty trap-ex-
actly barbarroja flourished his sword
 but there is no credit in decoying a weak
partridge like you little man
  one glance around showed dr shaw
that he was lost he instantly became
calm and cold
   what is the reason for this treachery
he demanded hand on sword
   it is twofold was the cool response
 the pretty senorita would be reason
enough for most men but honor comes
first with me i owe you a debt for what
you did to me at the cisterns and i shall
settle the debt
  barbarroja advanced glaring at shaw
behind the latter stood mistress betty mo-
tionless watching and listening in utter
despair
  oh traitorous rascal groaned shaw
 it is all your doing that-
   my doing indeed barbarroja strut-
ted with huge gusto  poor little chicken
of a man was not i lazaro de polan
sent to kill mulai ali well he is dead
as yonder marabout and you are in my
power and my friend gholam mahmoud
will take the leather box when spence shows
up as he must soon do
  he laughed at the despair of shaw it
was a proud moment for barbarroja whose
vanity was the greatest part of him he
stood there and laughed while that great
flaming beard of his curled and matted over
his chest already barbarroja was a little
drunk with the prowess of his arm and his
wits his three ruffians watched him in
proper awe
   now to our debt little man he went
on  you insulted me both in christian
and moslem fashion you kicked me for
which the ancestry of lazaro de polan de-
mands recompense and you tweaked my
beard for which the ancestry of barbar-
roja demands vengeance to what end
have i a great caballero entered the por-
tals of islam if i am not to enjoy the rights
of that faith so as a caballero of to-
ledo and a devout moslem i demand sat-
isfaction
  shaw uttered a hollow laugh
   you would murder me you scurvy
rogue
   not at all said barbarroja grandly
 i lazaro de polan am no slaughterer of
poor fools in my capacity as a good mos-
lem i should at once put steel into you
but in my capacity as a good caballero i
do not desire to sully my sword look at
this sword little man look at the spring
of it a true toledo blade out of the
sherifs treasury
  he seized the long blade bent it double
let it spring back again passion seized
upon shaw-the angry passion of one to
whom all hope is lost
  vile renegade he spat out bitterly
 if you have the courage to face me do
so dog that you are i suppose you will
have your bandits pistol me in the back
a look of astonished fury swept into
barbarrojas face he stared at shaw
then swung and faced his men at an or-
der from him they retired he turned
again to shaw
  for those words i kill you he
threw away his hat bowed mockingly
 in my capacity as a caballero of toledo
i salute you to you is the honor of
crossing blades with lazaro
  shaw swift as light lunged forward
the rapiers touched clashed hung sus-
pended they ground against each other
steel against steel wrist against wrist with
his free hand barbarroja carelessly twirled
his mustache shaw disengaged and hinged
again once more the steel slithered and
twined and hung futile against the sky
  not bad englishman observed bar-
barroja patronizingly  not bad come
thrust the point into this red beard of mine
-thrust in the point i recall a french-
man who had learned the italian blade and
who fancied himself greatly back at
ceuta
  shaw attacked furiously a silent dead-
liness in his manner barbarroja parried
the attack laughing and continued his
careless speech
   he was a clever frenchman he had
a thrust not unlike yours a stiff and up-
right godliness in his wrist when i
warned him against this red beard he
laughed and had die audacity to thrust
straight into it and what then why-
a curse fell from shaws lips not even
down the coast of barbary

a doctor of divinity but is human and for
one flickering instant the point of barbar-
roja had licked at his throat he parried
lunged again pressed the attack with a
colder skill a more supple wrist barbar-
roja escaped only by a backward leap dis-
engaging shaw was upon him instantly
again the thin blades met and twined and
hung suspended with life wavering in the
balance
   we were speaking of that frenchman
pursued barbarroja again twirling his red
mustache  he thought i jested even as
you think little senor and the point in
my red beard-dios have a care with
that riposte-the point was tangled in my
beard senor and my own point pricked
him very neatly in the throat-thus-
  barbarroja laughed very heartily and
midway of the laugh lunged like a demon
  in and out flickered his blade a very
tongue of death and his eyes glared in
sudden hot ferocity for blood shaw evad-
ed that licking tongue by a hair it reached
around him baffled him bore him desper-
ately backward
  he fought only by inspiration his eyes
upon the blazing stare of barbarroja his
blade fending off the slithering death by
sheer intuition this could not last long
and shaw knew it
  he was driven back and back while ever
those blood-hot eyes glared upon him and
the toledo slid ever with more deadly lust
now he was growing weary
  abruptly shaw gathered himself to-
gether so abruptly that in the very midst
of his retreat he plunged forward the
two blades went upward locked at the
hilts then shaw thrust back and forward
again leaped away stood on guard it
was all in a flash
  barbarroja moved not he stared at
shaw with an expression of dismayed con-
sternation then unexpectedly the to-
ledo dropped from his hand across his
breast surged a sudden wide flare of crim-
son his knees crumpled he plunged for-
ward on his face and lay quiet
   whether he died from the point mur-
mured shaw panting  or from sheer
amazement that i pinked him-tis all one
the result logically enough
  from the three ruffians came a wild
hoarse yell-a shout of mingled rage de-
spair and fright they broke and ran for
the horses with a rush a scramble a
flood of hot oaths they mounted and took
to flight dr shaw gazed after them
wide-eyed then he felt the hand of mis-
tress betty seize his arm-heard her voice
crying out at him
   look look-it is he-spence
  shaw whirled about there upon the
road he beheld a cloud of dust and far
ahead of the dust three riders already
drawing close-the foremost of them
spence
  an instant later spence was reining up
beside them while his men whirled on in
pursuit of the three escaping rogues
   good cried spence exultantly shak-
ing hands  the old governor scented
something amiss in your departure - he
said i might catch up with you so i came
along shaw whats been going on here
why did you leave town mistress betty
there was a moment of hurried explana-
tions as all spoke at once then the girl
seized upon the story and spence heard
of what had taken place soberly he nod-
ded at mention of mulai alis death
   aye we heard of his death-ripperda
was carried off his feet with delight he is
a gracious scoundrel that ripperda hel-
lo shaw what are you up to
  they turned dr shaw was muttering
over the toledo which he had picked up
now he lifted his face to them his eyes
gleaming with delight
  look he cried the rascal told
the truth this graving says that the
blade was made at toledo in the year 
of the moslem calendar by special order
of the great almansur of cordova to
think of such a sweet tool-a historic relic
-eight hundred years of age
   thrust it into your scabbard and let
us be gone-with congratulations on your
victory doctor a noble fight but rip-
perda is awaiting you and so keep your
wits about you
shaw stared with fallen jaw ripperda
then look to yourself patrick he
cried suddenly  this barbarroja told me
that it is known you carry the casket be-

argosy-allstory weekly
hind your saddle gholam mahmoud
knows it
  spence broke into another hearty laugh
 xay let him search  he cried gayly
 when i met with ripperda yesterday
i threw the box into the river the box is
gone mulai ali is dead-there is an end
to all intrigue here come three horsemen
who rode with me
  the horsemen among whom were some
of ripperdas bodyguard were returning
at the saddle of the three foremost were
three bloody heads steel says the prov-
erb is swifter than judgment
  thus the three reunited rode back into
udjde if patrick spence thought that he
was done with intrigue however he was far
wrong for mulai ali though wounded and
hidden away by the old governor was not
dead at all
chapter x
     he will spend his mouth and promise like
   brabbler the hound but when he performs
   astronomers foretell it i
pasha ripperda sat in the justice
hall of the kasbah and enjoyed his
triumph with the death of mulai
ali the one external danger that menaced
him was gone this thin man with the
haunted eye was the supreme ruler of west-
ern africa the combined barbary armies
and fleets obeyed his orders-egypt was in
alliance with him
  inwardly gout rioted in his blood as
he sat and gave orders and heard reports
agony twisted him around him were his
famous renegades bitter cruel men de-
voted to him and they could not save him
from the devils that dwelt in his blood
  messengers were dispatched to the sherif
with news of mulai alis death-though
the body had not been found-and rip-
perda ordered a litter made ready that
night for he was returning swiftly to the
army
  dr shaw patrick spence and mistress
betty entered the hall
  though the effort made his face livid
ripperda arose and tendered the girl the
pitiful ghost of that bow whose courtly
grace had once been famous from vienna
to madrid then he staggered and fell
back among the cushions
  in the eyes of the girl lay pity dr
shaw after one cold bow stood gazing at
the man with no evidence of feeling the
shrewd doctor was sensible that he faced
an enemy
  ripperda began to speak in english and
suddenly the inner man shone forth that
tongue of ripperdas had done incredible
feats and had not lost its cunning he ig-
nored shaw for the moment and addressed
the girl whose story he had learned from
spence on the road
   you have naught to fear under my pro-
tection mistress he concluded with that
wan and haunted smile of bis i shall take
you to the coast and place you aboard
the first christian ship available i have
promised the same to captain spence and
lady i have heard much regarding your
skill with the stars i would talk with
you later in the day regarding these augurs
of destiny this gentleman i take it is the
famous dr shaw of algiers
  shaw bowed again assenting dryly rip-
perda eyed him smiled assumed a blunt
frankness
   what say you-shall we consign the
past to oblivion sir i know in whose
company you have journeyed but as our
spanish proverb says  the dead have no
friends how say you
  shaw chuckled
     it is also said that a living dog is better
than a dead lion i pay you my compli-
ments for your generosity admit my culpa-
bility and pray your grace
  ripperda generous enough in victory ut-
tered a frank laugh
   greatness knows how to punish and
how to forgive i pardon you and welcome
you for your erudition is famed i pray
that you will join me for the noon meal
meantime your late quarters are again at
your disposal
  with a brief bow shaw accepted the dis-
missal the three were conducted to the
quarters so recently vacated and there with
the girls permission the two men lighted
pipes and talked spence told what had
happened to him and how he had flung the
                         	a
down the coast of barbary	
leather box into the river and joined rip-
perda
    ripperda was friendly enough he con-
cluded  he knew all about our friendship
with mulai ali bore no grudge and wel-
comed me a most amazing man
   very  said shaw dryly  before
ceuta he had two spanish spies impaled
on the same stake one day which amazed
even the moors mistake not patrick we
play with fire
   spence shrugged
    mistress betty he said  your predic-
 tions to mulai ali scarce jibe with the fate
 that had befallen him how explain you
 this discrepancy
    i explain nothing mr spence she
said  i am more interested in knowing
what is to become of us will ripperda
keep his promises think you
    he takes us to the coast to-night an-
 swered spence  yes it-it-
   as he spoke he had glanced through the
window which overlooked the courtyard
his voice died away suddenly he turned
darted to the door flung it open in the
doorway stood one of ripperdas body-
guard pistol on arm the man a french-
man did not budge
    no one is permitted to leave he said
and grinned  by order of the pasha
spence slammed the door again  down
there-gholam mahmoud talking with the
soldiers the presence of that man bodes
us ill
   dr shaw started
   the man in black-ripperdas confi-
dential agent h-m i see it all now he
has heard of barbarrojas death he is
down there questioning the renegades look-
ing for that leather box-ha patrick did
ripperdas men see you throw the box in the
river
    aye most likely spence stood at the
window watching the ominous figure below
 they said naught of it however per-
chance they saw it done
   a hammering at the door spence opened
to admit a hulking dutchman the leader
of ripperdas bodyguard he made a
smirking bow
    the pasha wishes to see the lady and
talk about the stars
    	a
   mistress betty rose calm and self-con-
tained she looked at spence and smiled
    do not fear for me friends for  think
that ripperda will keep his promise and
i may be able to help you farewell for
the present
  she left the room the two men looking
after her helpless of those twain one
was destined to see her no more in life
   mistress betty entered the hall of justice
but was detained at the door a tall figure
in black passed her and strode rapidly to
the side of ripperda to whom he spoke
low-voiced
    spence tried to destroy it but i can
recover it in a day or two if i succeed
will you give me this english girl for my
harem
  ripperdas face was overspread with a
mortal pallor from the anguish in his veins
    her and a dozen more like her he said
hoarsely  a million curses on that spence
go and fail me not i shall await your
report at adjerud the girl belongs to
you
  gholam mahmoud circled the seat and
vanished through a hidden door mistress
betty was brought forward curtsied and
waited ripperda forced a mechanical smile
to his lips
   mistress plead not for your compan-
ions he said gently they have de-
ceived me basely-
    they are my friends said the girl  i
cannot but ask your clemency for mr
spence and-
  ripperda made a hasty maddened ges-
ture his eyes flamed savagely
    very well very well spence shall live
i will carry him to adjerud and sell him as
a slave but shaw-say no word of him
i warn you oh how that man smiled at
me and in his heart he knew the box was
gone that i was defeated unable to keep
my promises-
  a spasm of rage came upon him he
writhed among his cushions then with an
effort got himself in hand
   my horoscope he exclaimed  cast
it fear not gentle lady you are under my
protection and shall go safe to england
you have the word of ripperda so while
we journey north do you cast my horo-

argosy-allstory weekly
scope for i think you will tell the truth
about things
  so the man lied mistress betty sens-
ing the lie from his very protests went a
shade whiter there was no fear in her
answer however
   my lord i am no wizard to diagram
the stars aright cannot be done in an hour
or a day i have no books to help me give
me certain information and in a week it
shall be done
  a week repeated ripperda well
have your way i shall have two women
slaves given you and new quarters here
we leave an hour before the sunset prayer
i shall send a scribe to you at once let
him write down what information you desire
for the horoscope and i will send it to you
in an hour until night rest for we must
travel fast
  so mistress betty went to her prison and
saw her friends no more
  an hour before sunset ripperda and his
cavalcade departed in the courtyard was
riding and mounting a horse litter was
read- for ripperda another for mistress
betty spence and dr shaw disarmed
and bound were dragged forth beside rip-
perdas litter from his curtained cushions
ripperda glared out like some venomous
reptile at shaw
   smile on fool said ripperda acidly
 when the stake has pierced into your
vitals and death is red before your eyes
remember ripperda ho there amel
  the old governor came forward obsequi-
ously ripperda pointed to dr shaw
   when the muezzin cries for morning
prayer set this man upon a stake at the
western gate when he is dead send his
head to me in salt that i may see whether
he still smiled in death place the other
man on a horse-forward in the name of
allah
  spence was tied into a high saddle to
him pierced the voice of shaw
   farewell patrick god watch over
you
   and you returned spence in a choked
voice he looked back once but shaw
had already been dragged away
  through the dty street to the north gate
and then out in the sweet sunset through
  the olive groves and the fields of green al-
falfa passed the cavalcade and on to the
winding road that led north over the hori-
zon to the sea the sea how the thought
of it pierced spence at this moment
   himself tightly bound destined to slav-
ery poor shaw impaled at the gate of
udjde mistress betty clenched in the grip
of ripperda and trusting to his treacherous
word and all these in the turn of a single
day
   a long score gholam mahmoud mut-
tered spence thickly  this is your doing
somehow-a long score to settle-
   so the sun sank from sight and the day
was done
chapter xl
    fortuna-transmutat incertos honores
tie little town of adjerud at the
mouth of the tafna river was enjoy-
ing a brief heyday of prosperin
upon an eminence behind the village was
camped the great pasha ripperda with his
personal troops he kept the roads busy
with messengers to the camps at oran in
the east and ceuta in the west he had
been here a week and illness held him fast
   below the village and by the deposition
of fate camped between ripperda and the
shore were a thousand wild berber horse-
men come from morocco to join the armies
ripperda was holding them here uncertain
as yet where they were most needed
   in the tiny port lay two ships one was
a small brigantine of tetuan ripperdas
personal ship manned by renegades like
himself on this ship said rumor were
kept great treasures fasha ripperda never
knew when he was to be sent a-wandering
once more the other ship was a battered
hulk brought in by a salee rover to be re-
paired great crowds thronged the beach
to watch her she had come from a far
country and under her stern were the
strange words  boston lass
   aboard her were a score or more infidel
captives hard at work each night they
were brought ashore and kept guarded in a
fishing shed on the beach among them
was patrick spence turned over to the
down the coast of barbary

fate of a slave working under the lash with
his fellow american seamen
   in a separate tent adjoining that of rip-
perda remained mistress betty and her two
slave women she was closely guarded
for her own sake when she left the tent it
was usually at night from her women
she knew of spences fate and knew that
her own would be no better
  upon the evening of friday  the day
of the congregation she was summoned to
the tent of ripperda he sat propped
among pillows his swathed feet upon two
stools his harried features bore such a
blaze of exultation that she knew instantly
some great thing had happened messen-
gers had come from oran by land and from
ceuta by sea
   good evening lady said ripperda
courteously  is not the horoscope fin-
ished
    at this time to-morrow night i will pre-
sent it to you responded the girl quietly
    ah and does it tell of success or fail-
ure
    only one failure have i seen so far my
lord and that is death but there are evil
influences in the south and i fear to-mor-
row may tell another story
   know you what has chanced to-day
ripperda gave a vibrant laugh  hear
then the fleet and army of algiers have
joined my forces before oran a victory
has been won at ceuta the sultan of
egypt has joined me and last-read this
which just came from oran from the hand
of admiral perez himself
   he extended a paper a letter in spanish
the girl read
     i write you hastily during battle the
   enemy attacked us and are trapped before
   me are the heads of the governor general
   marquis de santa cruz the marquis de yal-
   decagnas colonel pineland a hundred offi-
   cers of the walloon and other regiments in
   the name of allah who gives victory
                      thy friend
                                       perez
   now cried ripperda proudly  let us
see if your horoscope forecasts what must
happen the spaniard driven from africa
-and what then finish your labors fair
lady
    to-morrow night they shall be finished
my lord and forget not your promise to
me
   i renew the promise-you shall have
one of the captured spanish ships at orant
to go whither you will
   the girl left the tent trembling for she
feared the man and his purposes for a
space she stood gazing over the camp-crowd-
ed shore below and the little bay where
the ship lights glimmered sadness was
upon her the load of despair grew more
hopeless each hour all her hopes had
crashed down
  now she was aware that a dark-clad
moor approached the man who guarded her
they talked softly there was the chink of
money then the moor came forward and
addressed her in spanish
   senorita i come from udjde i have
a letter for you another for captain
spence
   mistress betty started violently she took
the paper extended to her
   he is among the slaves yonder she
said despairing  you cannot reach him
the moor laughed quietly
    aye we knew that ere i left my mas-
ter the governor has word daily by pigeon
i am told to bid you hope and despair
not adios 
  crushing the note in her hand the girl
turned to her own tent in a fever of eager-
ness she dismissed her slaves and bent
above the lamp she opened the paper and
read
     if this reaches you know that mulai ali
   is alive and weh and will be proclaimed sherif
   ere this reaches you make what use of the
   news you can-he is already marching on fez
   but we keep it secret the bearer will rescue
   you and spence if possible and bears full
   powers from mulai ali to act for him god
   keep you sweet mistress
                            thos shaw
    tears brimmed the girls eyes rcscuel
   good dr shaw alive and well mulai ali
   alive
    whether she could be plucked from rip-
  per das hand was a large query spence
  was another matter she felt sure that mulai
  alis emissary would rescue him that
  moor must have many friends men of alis

party enemies of the pasha was shaw
preparing some deadly blow against rip-
perda here in this place undoubtedly
   exultation burned in the girls eyes as she
turned to the horoscope
  mulai all wins she murmured her
eyes wide in rapt thought  though rip-
perda slay me for it i shall drive home
one blow to his face-such a blow as he
shall rue bitterly the man means to play
me false break his promise i read it in
his eyes well then here is a weapon that
shall strike home to him 
   she seized quill and ink horn and fell to
work
  the following day was quiet ripperda
looked hourly for fresh dispatches from
oran but none came his gout was worse
in her tent mistress betty could hear the
deep groans from his quarters only his
renegades were encamped here on the hill
for he would trust no others
   late in the afternoon from her tent the
girl saw the arrival of a dozen horsemen
from the south their leader wore a black
burnoose and at sight of him the girl
shrank gholam mahmoud what new
evil did his presence foretell had the man
come to warn ripperda
  the girls fears might have been both
lightened and increased had she followed
gholam mahmoud into ripperdas tent
he swaggered in saluted ripperda and
laid down a bundle
    you have it there ripperda started
up eagerly
   aye said gholam mahmoud  as i
thought captain spence flung it into the
river well here it is being sewn in can-
vas it has probably suffered little damage
it is unopened
   ripperda seized on the bundle with trem-
bling fingers ripped away the canvas took
a knife and cut the stiffened leather around
the lock opening the box he found a num-
ber of small packages wrapped in oiled silk
a long breath of relief came from him and
he relaxed amid his cushions gholam
mahmoud regarded him with sardonic
gaze
   and my reward
    ah ripperda started  wait until
to-night the girl is casting my horoscope
remain hear the reading of it-and take
her are you content
 it is well master i shall go and rest
until night
  the heel of the afternoon passed into sun-
set as the daylight waned the sail of a
fast little sloop was seen speeding up the
harbor toward the village
  it was now that ripperda sent for mis-
tress betty
  starry-eyed she entered the tent holding
against the bosom of her white robe the
scroll which was to foretell the doom of
pasha ripperda he sat among the cush-
ions smiling that weary smile of his to
one side sat gholam mahmoud puffing at
a water pipe save for them and the guard
at the door the pavilion was empty
   the labor is done ripperdas tone
was silky  and did you obey my re-
quest
   i did said the girl  my lord your
entire fate is written here
 then read it read it ripperdas in-
terest quickened  tell first of the things
i	most want to know-the issue of my un-
dertakings  can study the whole horo-
scope later does everything go well
   not so my lord
  the girls tone was grave the gaze that
she bent upon ripperda was steady
 if you desire flattery i might give it
but what i have written here is the truth
  ripperda leaned back a dry smile upon
his lips
 let us know the worst mistress when
shall the infidel be driven from africa
   never mistress betty unrolled the
paper and read  your star has waned
my lord the war against spain is doomed
to failure-nay has already failed mulai
ali is alive and has been proclaimed sherit
you yourself have not a fortnight longer to
enjoy life-
  an oath ripped from pashas lips he sat
upright fun- in his eves
  	what madness is this he cried out
why this-		 
  a cry from the door into the pavilion
rushed a panting man waving a paper the
guard at the door called in to ripperda
  u a boat from oran lord this message
has just come from the admiral
down the coast of barbary

  ripperda seized the paper tore at the
seals within he found only a few hasty
lines
     allah has turned victory into defeat the
  algerine fleet is crushed on the rocks our
  camp is taken our army is shattered pasha
  ali is dead flee to tetuan i meet you there
   all is lost
                                      perez
from ripperda burst a hollow groan
his features became ghastly and for a mo-
ment he sat as though paralyzed the
paper fell from his nerveless fingers
gholam mahmoud leaning forward read
the message in silcnce
  in this dread silence came another cry
  from the guard at the door
     a courier from the south with urgent
  news 
     admit him said ripperda in a dead
  voice
     in the name of god cried the dust-
  white man flinging himself on his face at
  the entrance  mulai ali is not dead but
  alive has been proclaimed sherif is march-
  ing on fez with all the zenete tribes behind
  him also an hour ago i met two spahis
  from the army at ceuta who told me that
  the infidels have raised the siege there and
  that a great fleet of spanish ships has passed
  on the way to oran-
    from ripperda broke one choking cry
  he rose swayed his face purpled with a
  rush of blood guards rushed into the
  tent caught him in their arms he could
  utter only one terrible word-
   tetuan he gasped and again
   tetuan
     he fell forward in their arms well they
  knew that it was the signal to flee with him
  to his one refuge-tetuan on the coast
  the captain of the bodyguard came running
  in hastily
     there is mad tumult in the camp-by
  allah what has happened here
     disaster said gholam mahmoud cool-
  ly  the armies at oran and ceuta de-
  stroyed mulai ali alive and proclaimed
  sherif the master says to flee to tetuan
  at once take the ship
    listen shouted a renegade from the
  doorway  listen 
from the camp below came rising a great
chorus of voices while muskets banged
 ras ripperda clamored a shrill deadly
yell and the name of mulai ali rose high
   theyll have his head sure enough
gholam mahmoud gestured toward the un-
conscious ripperda  get him away
you are cut off from the ship you cant
gain it now to horse
    by allah that is the truth cried the
 captain of the guard  we cannot reack
 the shore bring him out comrades-to
 horse to horse
  a rush of excited men the tent emp-
tied save for the girl shrinking to one side
-and gholam mahmoud the latter
brought a whistle to his lips blew a shrill
blast the next moment a dozen men-
his own men-were crowding into the pa-
vilion a mad tumult was rolling up from
the camp
  loot everything cried gholam mah-
moud  get aboard ripperdas ship-
take her and her treasures for ourselves
quickly scatter and meet at the shore
he turned upon mistress betty one
cry broke from her but too late a shawl
was about her head and he lifted her in his
arms
  a moment afterward the rush of mad-
dened berbers yelling the name of mulai
ali and shrieking for the head of ripperda
burst over the group of tents these were
empty only a hard-riding group of horse-
men under the starlight showed that some
few men had been faithful to the fallen
pasha-faithful enough to flee with him
chapter xii
     now from the bow came a noise of hum-
   ming and the crafty odysseus sailed as he
   heard it
when that fateful evening cast its
shadows over the bay spence and
his score of fellow slaves were
herded into their fish-shed ironed as usual
by wtist and ankle but to-night they did
not cast themselves down in hopeless de-
spair on the piles of filthy nets instead
there was a low murmur of talk in the shed
spence eyed his companions eagerly

argosy-allstory weekly
three of them were from newfoundland
the others were boston men two over the
score lay to one side sorely wounded all
the officers of the boston lass had been
calm at her taking and now it was to
spence that these men looked for leader-
ship nor did he fail them
   fear not lads he said quietly
 that moor was no liar he and a dozen
more men stand ready to aid us and he
bears an order from mulai ali to free us
once escaped we are safe enough
    and the lady master spoke up lanky
cyrus roberts whom spence had appoint-
ed to be his chief mate  be yon moor
a going to get her aboard the ship
    so he promised me answered spence
	hark something has happened in the
camp
   they fell silent listening tensely some-
thing indeed had happened the shallop
had come to shore bearing news of the dis-
aster at oran now as the news spread
through the camp there arose a great tu-
mult of cursing and shouting amid this
clamor a dozen men stole into the shed and
their leader came to the side of spence
   make haste capitdn he cried in
spanish  disaster has befallen our army
at oran and already my emissaries are
spreading news of mulai ali presently
the tribesmen will be crying for the head
of ripperda-here are robes and swords
the moor and his men were already un-
locking the irons of the seamen from
somewhere close at hand boomed a musket
followed by a shrill yell  ras ripperda
 i must go exclaimed the moor  i
shall see to the schorita and meet you at
the boats take your time and move care-
fully lest you be recognized these men
of mine will obey you order them in cas-
tilian-farewell 
   he was gone running out into the clamor
that now made an inferno of the camp
   spence freed of his irons rose and took
charge there was no further need of cau-
tion for the berber camp was now in tu-
multuous confusion guns flashing and
torches flaring on every hand spences
voice commanded the seamen sharply as
he stood beside the pile of robes and arms
which had been brought by the moors
   every man file past me and get a bur-
noose mr roberts take charge of
these scimitars and deal them out while i
show the men how to get into the robes
  aye aye sir responded roberts
promptly
  for any in the fever-hot camp to know
that the christian slaves were escaping
would provoke instant massacre and
spence took no chances he garbed each
man in a burnoose while roberts handed
out the swords and a few pistols which had
been provided deep were the oaths of
satisfaction which sounded as the men
gripped the hilts and felt themselves once
more free and about to strike a blow
   nigh enough like cutlasses lads sang
out roberts  to make em swing well
all ready here sir be they moors goin
with us
  spence addressed the moors found that
they were to help him capture the brigan-
tine and ordered them to lead the way a
last word to his men
   not a word until we get under her
side lads or we may lose everything she
is ripperdas own ship and if he gets
aboard her we may have stiff work of it
but shes our only chance of getting home
again-look alive follow the moors
  it was the hope of spence that he might
not only capture the brigantine but take
ripperda prisoner for it was deemed cer-
tain that ripperda would flee to his ship
even spence perceived when he emerged
from the shed that this was an impossi-
bility from every side the berbers were
surrounding the little eminence on which
stood ripperdas camp and the pasha was
quite cut off from shore
   unless he gets away by land hes done
for thought spence listening to the fren-
zied yells of the mob
  meantime with his men he was ap-
proaching the shore where the fisher boats
lay drawn up here everything was dark-
ness and confusion several boats were
creeping over the water between the shore
and the anchored ships and the moors
who were leading the party of white men
came to a halt counseling a wait for their
leader
  spence controlled the eagerness of his
down the coast of barbary

men anxiously awaiting news of mistress
betty suddenly a growl broke from
roberts
   master spence theyve doused the
lights on the brigantine-if theyre not a
hauling of her out then sink me for a
dutchman aye-can hear the clink o
the pawls-kedging her they are
  true enough spence hearing that
sound imagining that he could see the
vague shape of the brigantine already mov-
ing across the water caught his breath
sharply he breathed a prayer as he stood
there in agonized suspense freedom-
slipping away in the darkness without
that brigantine they were lost he knew it
the others knew it and they waited for
a girl
  around him he could feel the tense
straining and quivering of the seamen-
their panting breaths their awful agony
of fear in that moment from one bronzed
throat came a stifled groan then silence
again at length one man spoke up in
terrorized accents
   master spence tis too much to bide
here doing naught waiting for a lady
somebody smote the man there was the
thud of a blow then desperate silence
spence felt a thrill as he sensed the quality
of these seamen sacrificing their hopes
jeopardizing their chances of escape for a
girl they had never seen he knew how
bitterhard was that self-control
   ready at the boats men he said
quietly  lay the wounded men aboard
and stand by to launch
  a rustle of movement a scrape of feet
as they obeyed all the while from the
camp and the hill there was a flittering of
torches and a continual outcry from the
berbers the hapless servants of ripperda
were being slaughtered there
  then a burst of running feet and three
men came hurtling out of the tumult the
foremost was the moorish leader who had
freed spence and from him came a sharp
terrible burst of words
 she is gone gholam mahmoud has
seized her taken her aboard ripperdas
ship-he and his men have seized the ship
 launch like the snap of a taut ca-
ble came the word from spence  run
em out lads-the lady is board the brig-
antine-after her
  a growl of excited oaths a heaving cf
bodies and the cumbersome fisher boats
were scraped over the shingle the men
tumbled aboard seamen and moors inter-
mixed and there was a moment of confu-
sion
  spence with six seamen only in his
craft and the moorish leader were the first
to get away the oars dipped and tugged
the boat drew out from shore
   what of ripperda murmured spence
the moor whispered an oath
   escaped may allah blast him his
bodyguard rode away with him gholam
mahmoud had a dozen men there they
seized the lady and ripperdas treasures
and got aboard his ship i was detained
 how many of them aboard her
    thirty at least all corsairs
  satisfied that the other boats were fol-
lowing spence drove ahead the brigan-
tine was moving along in tow of boats she
would catch the land breeze soon already
sheaves were squeaking and canvas was
slapping a moment afterward it was evi-
dent that gholam mahmoud no longer
feared those ashore lanterns flashed on
the deck and hoarse shouts echoed in the
bows of the brigantine a cresset broke out
its smoky flare three boats towed her
   at her lads snapped spence
   he steered for hanging lines in the ships
waist and the men gave way for a space
it seemed that they would lay her board
unchallenged then from her poop cracked
out a voice-the voice of gholam mah-
moud it was followed by the crack of a
pistol
   off with the robes lads all up-
boarders away
  the boat surged forward-the oars fell
spence caught a line the agile moor an-
other and they were over the rail from
the poop and bulwarks came a rush of men
the moor emptied a pistol into them then
leaped forward with his curved blade swing-
ing spence cooler of head stood by the
rail and his steel dropped the first man to
reach him
  now his men begem coming over the side
sword in teeth with a shout to them

argosy-allstory weekly
spence threw himself forward to the rescue
of the moor embroiled amid a crowd
   hurray
  the seamen streamed after him a pis-
tol cracked and another the yankee rush
burst the crowd asunder the yell rose
more shrill as spences other boats came
up and for a moment he thought they
would take the ship at a blow only for
a moment now from stem and stern came
a rush of figures steel flamed in the lan-
tern light the confusion and whirl of
blades made an inextricable turmoil across
the deck from all this stood forth one
terrible vision which was burned into
spences memory
  himself engaged with a swarthy corsair
he saw gholam mahmoud cross blades with
one of the newfoundland men a lantern
lit them distinctly he saw gholam lean
forward in a curious manner-saw his
blade sweep out then down and up-and
with a scream the seaman died ripped from
abdomen to chin it was the famous ma-
meluke stroke the deadly and unavoidable
cut which made the mameluke swordsmen
invincible throughout the east
  allah yelled the corsairs and the
moors who fought for spence responded
in kind spence clove his way to the poop
and found the rail ahead of him the
waist was cleared to bow and stern his
men were driving the defenders then a
rush changed the whole aspect the sea-
men became bunched in the waist fired on
from poop and bow
  aft lads shouted spence his voice
rising over the din  aft to the poop
  he leaped up the ladder gained the
poop and found himself assailed by a cor-
sair the rats of the ship spence fended
his head with his blade and the steel shiv-
ered he reeled saw the swarthy face
whirl in upon him and leaped barehanded
he jerked up the bearded head caught the
naked torso threw all his power into the
terrific wrench the corsair shrieked once
then went limp as his neck twisted
  up with you men shouted spence
but they were already coming
  from the deck spence caught up a sword
and led the rush behind from the bow
the corsairs were pursuing but the seamen
gained the poop and began to clear it
now amid the turmoil spence caught a
glimpse of a white figure by the starboard
rail dragging a lantern from its place he
stared incredulous at the face of mistress
betty-then a streak of fire and a roar
leaped forth from her hand a little swivel
gun mounted there at the rail had been
emptied into the crowded ranks of the cor-
sairs
  in the flames of that discharge darted
forward the face of gholam mahmoud
contorted and infernal in its rage spence
saw the flash of a weapon heard the girl
cry out hurled forward of what passed
around him he saw nothing-now he had
gholam mahmoud before him and he
heard the voice of mistress betty in his
ears and was fighting like a madman
  it was fortunate that spence had seen
and noted that dreaded mameluke stroke
for now he saw gholam mahmoud lean for-
ward again in that same curious manner
spence leaped back and the blade hurtled
up-a miss gholam snarled as spence
pressed in again no words passed the
two men fought back toward the stem-
back and back quartering the deck with
blow after blow
  once again came that mameluke stroke
this time so close that the steel point drew
blood from spences chest as the blow
missed almost before it had missed spence
was in and struck fiercely with all his
strength
  he felt the blade go home-heard the
sword of gholam mahmoud clatter down
on the deck then in a flash the man
leaped up to the rail-gained it he stood
there an instant getting his balance for a
spring to the water in this instant came
something like a streak of light that took
him squarely between the shoulders
  a knife it was-a long curved knife
from the hand of a moor
  gholam mahmoud threw out his arms
the knife haft standing from his back then
convulsively the body leaped from be-
low came a splash-no more
  spence leaned on his sword panting out
of breath things swimming before his eyes
nor could he move even when mistress
betty came to him her voice seemed dis-
down the coast of barbary

tant and far then he was dimly aware of
roberts exultantly addressing him
    shes ours master spence four of
our lads killed all a bit hurt-but shes
ours 
    make sail muttered spence  all
hands-make sail

    a randy dandy dandy-o
   a whet of ale and brandy-o
   with a rumbelow and a westward-ho
   heave my mariners all-o
tetuan was passed and the narrow
way of gib-al-taric and off tangier
the brigantine spoke a small galley
which had come from the port to meet her
the two craft lay side by side for the sea
was like glass
   here spence said farewell to the moor
who had freed him and to the six men who
remained of the moors following
   from the lazaret of the brigantine was
lilted a chest one of several in which was
laid away ripperdas ill-gotten gold this
chest with certain other plunder was
swung aboard the galley as mulai alis
share then spence confided to the moor
that same water-stained leather box which
held in its care ripperdas great schemes
   to mulai ali this is worth more than
the gold he said  take it to him with
our thanks and good-will
   so the moor passed to his own ship and
the galley departed spence called the
crew into the waist and with mistress
betty beside him laid a choice before them
   say now iads which way we steer
whether to the northand england or out
across the atlantic to home again many
of you are wounded we are short-handed
the
our charts are poor our instruments worse
yet we have food and drink to spare set-
tle the matter by vote and let us get out
of these waters
   now the men grinning looked one at
another roberts was urged forth as
spokesman he touched his forelock to
the girl and regarded spence with a wide
smile
    why sir as to instruments and charts
and such that be your business but that
there gold down below - be there much
left
   spence laughed  enough to make us
all rich men lads and ripperda pays the
shot so speak out freely
    well sir we would be fools to steer
for any english port wi that gold below
said roberts  the less any one knows
of our business say we the better if it
please you master spence we vote to make
boston town and if the royal governor
hears naught o that there gold twill be
good luck for us
    very well said spence  master
roberts lay the course for the azores and
well try our fortune for home
   a cheer echocd up from the crew spence
turned to the girl-met her grave regard
    well mistress betty will you be
saddened in heart to see the hills of bos-
ton over our bow instead of the chalk cliffs
of dover
   a smile lightened in the eyes of the girl
as her hand crept into his
    dear patrick hast never read your
bible then dost not remember what
ruth said to the man in whose hand her
own lay-even as mine lies in yours
   and patrick spence laughed out as he
looked with her to the west and the ship
swung about to the wind

delhi and took the peacock throne and
the kohinoor and everything else of value
back to persia but he didnt get the ruby
for the vizier of the king of delhi stole it
then alam the eunuch stole it from the
vizier its possession was desirable not
only because of its great value as a jewel
but because it held in its satanic glitter an
unearthly power either of preservation to
its holder or malignant evil against his
enemies
  at any rate sewlal sent for hunsa the
night of the ordeal and explained to him
somewhat casually that a jewel merchant
passing through mahrattaland had in his
collection a ruby of no great value but a
stone that he would like to become pos-
sessed of because a ruby was his lucky gem
the dewan intimated that hunsa would
get a nice private reward for this particular
gem if by chance he could quite secretly
procure it for him
  next day was a busy one in the bagree
camp
  having followed the profession of decoits
and thugs for generations it was with them
a fine art unlimited pains were taken over
every detail as it had been decided that
they would go as a party of mendicants and
bearers of family bones to mother ganges
there were many things to provide to carry
out the masquerade-stage properties as
it were-red bags for the bones of females
and white bags for those of the males
  in two days one of the spies came with
word that ragganath the merchant had
started on his journey riding in a covered
cart drawn by two of the slim silk-skinned
trotting bullocks and was accompanied by
six men servants and guards on the sec-
ond night he would encamp at sarorra so
a start was made the-next morning
  sookdee ajeet singh and hunsa ac-
companied by twenty men and gulab be-
gum took the road the gulab traveling in
an enclosed cart as befitted the favorite of
a rajah and with her rode the wife of sook-
dee as her maid
  ajeet rode a marwari stallion a black
roach-crested brute with bad hocks and an
evil eye ajeet sat his horse a convincing
figure a rajput rajah
  beneath a rich purple coat gleamed like
silver tracery his steel shirt of mail
through his sash of red silk was thrust a
straight-bladed sword and from the top of
his turban of blue and gold thread peeped
a red cap with dangling tassel of gold
  in the afternoon of the second day the
bagrees came to the village of sarorra
   we will camp here the leader com-
manded  close to the mango tope through
which we have just passed then we will
summon the headman and if he is as such
accursed officials are the holy one the yogi
will cast upon him and his people a curse
also i will threaten him with the loss of his
ears
   the one who is to be destroyed has not
yet come hunsa declared  for here is
what these dogs of villagers call a place of
rest though it is but an open field
  ajeet turned upon the jamadar the
one who is to be destroyed say you hunsa
wtio spoke in council that the merchant
was to be killed we are men of decoily-
we rob these fat pirates who rob the poor
but we take life only when it is necessary
to save our own
   and when a robbed one who has power
such as rich merchants have make com-
plaint and give names the powers take
from us our profit and cast us into jail
hunsa retorted
   and forget not ajeet that we are here
among the mahrattas far from our own
forests that we can escape into if there is
outcry sookdee interjected  if the
voices are hushed and the bodies buried
beneath where we cook our food there will
be only silence till we are safe back in
karowlee the dewan will not protect us
if there is an outcry-he will deny that he
has promised protection
  the bagrees were already busy prepar-
ing the camp the camp of a supposed party
of men on a sacred mission
  it was like the locating of a circus the
tents they had brought stood gaudily in the
hot sun some white and some of cotton
cloth dyed in brilliant colors red and blue
and yellow in front of ajeets tent a bam-
boo pole was planted from the top of which
floated a red flag carrying a figure of the
monkey-god hanuman embroidered in
green and yellow

argosy-allstory weekly
  the red and white bags carrying bones
which were supposed to be the bones of de-
funct relatives were suspended from tri-
pods of bamboo to preserve them from the
pollution of the soil
  and presently three big drums nakaras
were ranged in front of the yogis tent and
were being beaten by strong-armed drum-
mers while a conch-shell blared forth a
discordant note that was supposed to be
pleasing to the gods
  some of the bagrees issued from their
tents having suddenly become canonized
metamorphosed from highwaymen to de-
vout yogis their bodies looking curiously
lean and ascetic now clothed largely in
ashes and paint
   go you hunsa ajeet commanded
 into this depraved village and summon
the patil to come forth and pay to the
sainted yogi the usual gift of one rupee four
annas and make his salaams also he is
to provide fowl and fruits for us who are
on this sacred mission he may be a son
of swine such as the lord of a village is so
speak jamadar of the swords the rajahs
guards carry say nothing as to the ex-
pected one but let your eyes do all the
questioning
  hunsa departed on his mission and even
then the villagers could be seen assembled
between the bagrees and the mud huts
watching curiously the encampment
   sookdee ajeet said  if we can rouse
the anger of the patil-
  the jamadar laughed  if you insist
upon the payment of silver you will ac-
complish that ajeet
  ajeet touched his slim fingers to sook-
dees arm  do not forget jamadar-call
me rajah but as to the village if we anger
them they will not entertain the merchant
-they will not let him rest in the village
and also if they are of an evil temper we
will warn the merchant that they are
thieves who will cut his throat and rob him
we will give him the protection of our num-
bers
  if the merchant is fat-and when they
attain wealth they always become fat-he
mill be happy with us rajah thinking per-
haps that he will escape a gift of money
the patil would exact
   yes ajeet singh answered  we will
ask him for nothing when he departs
after a time hunsa was seen approach-
ing and with him the gray-whiskered patil
  the latter was a commoner he sug-
gested a black-faced gray-whiskered mon-
key of the jungles indeed the pair were an
anthropoid couple hunsa the gorilla and
the headman an ape behind them strag-
gled a dozen villagers men armed with long
ironwood sticks of combat
  the headman salaamed the yogi and
ajeet saying  this is but a poor place
for holy men and the rajah to rest for the
water is bad and famine is upon us
   a liar and the son of a wild ass de-
clared ajeet prompty  give to this saint
the gift of silver lest he put the anger of
kali upon you and call upon her of the
fiery furnace in the sacred hills to destroy
your houses also send fowl and grain and
think yourself favored of kali that you
make offering to such a holy one and to a
raiah who is in favor with sindhia
  but the villager had no intention of part-
ing with worldly goods if he could get out
of it he expostulated enlarged upon his
poverty rubbed dust upon his forehead
and called upon the gods to destroy him if
he had a breakfast in the whole village for
himself and people declaring solemnly
 by my junwa-though he wore no sa-
cred thread- there is no food for man or
horse in the village then he waxed
angry asking indignantly who were these
stragglers upon the road that they should
come to him an official of the peshwa to
demand tribute he would have them de-
stroyed beyond not two kos away were
a thousand soldiers-which was a gorgeous
lie-who if he but sent a messenger would
come and behead the lot would cast the
sacred bones in the gaudy bags upon the
dunghill of the village bullocks
   to-morrow monkey man the gift will
be doubled ajeet answered calmly  for
that is the law and you know it
  but the patil thinking there would be
little fight in the party of pilgrims and
mendicants called to his stickmen to bring
help and they would beat these insolent
ones and drive them on their way
   take the yogi hunsa ajeet said
caste

 and the men that have the fire powder
and throw it upon the thatched roof of a
hut in the way of a visitation from the gods
because this ape will not leave us in peace
for our mission until he is subdued
  in obedience as hunsa and the yogi
moved toward the village the patil cried
 where go you
   we go with a message from the gods
to you who offer insult to a holy one the
yogi replied
   the villagers armed with sticks retreated
slowly before the yogi dreading to offer
harm to the sainted one muttering his
curses his iron tongs clanking at every step
the yogi strode to the first mudwall huts
and there raising his voice cried aloud
 maha kali consume the houses of these
men of an evil heart who would deny
the offering to thee
   then at a wave of his skeleton arm the
two men threw upon the thatched roof of a
hut a gray preparation of gunpowder which
was but a pyrotechnical trick and imme-
diately the thatch burst into flames
   there accursed ones unbelievers
kali has spoken the yogi declared sol-
emnly and turning on his heels went back
to the camp
  the headman and his men with howls
of dismay rushed back to stop the confla-
gration and just then the jewel mer-
chant arrived in his cart the curtains of
the canopy were thrown back and the fat
hindu sat blinking his owl eyes in con-
sternation at sight of ajeet he descended
salaamed and asked
   has there been a decoity in the village
is it war and bloodshed
  ajeet assumed the haughty condescend-
ing manner of a rajput princc and ex-
plained with a fair scope of imagination
that the patil was a man of ungovernable
temper who gave protection to thieves and
outlaws that the village itself was a nest
for them that two of his servants having
gone into the village to purchase food had
been set upon beaten and robbed that the
conflagration had been caused by the fire
from a gun that one of the debased villagers
had poked through a hole in the roof to
shoot his servants
    as my name is ragganath it is a visi-
tation upon these scoundrels the mer-
chant declared
 it is indeed sethjee
ajeet had diplomatically used the  seth-
jee which was a friendly rendering of the
name  seth meaning  a merchant and
the wily hindu not to be outdone in cour-
tesy promoted ajeet
 such an outrage maharaja on the part
of these low-caste people in the presence of
the sainted one and the pilgrims upon such
a sacred mission to mother gunga has
brought upon them the wrath of the gods
may the village be destroyed and the
patil when he dies come back to earth a
snake to crawl upon his belly
 the headman even refused to give the
holy one the gift of silver tendering in-
stead threats ajeet added
  the merchant spat his contempt when he
heard this
  wretches he declared debased as-
sociates of skinners of dead animals and
scrapers of skulls bah and he spat
again  and to think but for the presence
having arrived here first i most assuredly
would have gone into this village and per-
haps have been slain for my-
  he stopped and rolled his eyes appre-
hensively he had been on the point of
mentioning his jewels but though he was
among saints and kings he suddenly re-
membered the danger
   we would not have camped here
ajeet declared  had we not been a strong
party because this village has an evil repu-
tation you have been favored by the gods
in finding honest men in the way of pro-
tection and no doubt it is because you
are one who makes offerings to the deity
   and if the maharaja will suffer the
presence of a poor merchant who is but a
shopkeeper i will rest here in his protec-
tion
   ajeet singh graciously consented to this
and the merchant commanded his men to
erect his small tent beneath the limbs of
the deep green mango trees
  the decoits watched closely the trans-
port of the merchants effects from the cart
to the tent when a strong iron box that
was an evident weight for its two carriers
was borne first their eyes glistened there-

 in was the wealth of jewels the flying horse-
 man of the night had whispered to the yogi
 about
chapter viii
the art of the strangler
when the merchants tent had been
erected and he had gone to its
shelter the jamadars sitting well
beyong the reach of his ears held a council
of war ajeet was opposed to the killing
of ragganath and his men but hunsa
pointed out that it was the only way they
were either decoits or they were men of toil
men of peace dead men were not given
to carrying tales and if no stir were made
about the decoitv until they were safely
back in karowlee they could enjoy the
fruits of their spoil which would be un-
doubtedly great by the use of the stran-
gling cloth there would be no outcry no
din of batde they of the village would
think that the camp was one of sleep then
when the bodies had been buried in a pit
the earth tramped down flat and solid and
cooking fires buqt over it to obliterate all
traces of a grave they would strike camp
and go back the way they had come
   ajeet was forced to admit that it was the
 one thorough way but he persisted that
 they were decoits and not thugs
   at this sookdee laughed  jamadar
he said  what matters to a dead man the
manner of his killing indeed it is a merci-
ful way such as bhowanee herself decreed
-in a second it is over but with the
spear or the sword-ah i have seen men
writhe in agony and die ten times before it
was an end
     but a caste is a caste ajeet objected
  and the manner of the caste we are de-
 coits and we only slay when there is no
 other way
   hunsa tipped his gorilla body forward
from where it rested on his heels as he sat
and his lowering eyes were sullen with im-
patience
    chief ajeet he snarled  think you
that we can rob the seth of his treasure
without an outcry-and if there is an out-
cry that he will not go back to those of
his caste in poona and when trouble is
made think you that the dewan will thank
us for the bungling of this and as to the
matter of a thug or a decoit half our men
have been taught the art of the strangler
with these -and extending his massive
arms he closed his coarse hands in a
gnarled grip- with these i would with
one sharp in-turn on the roomal crack the
neck of the merchant and he would be
dead in the taking of a breath and ajeet
if this is the manner of men that causes
you fear-
   hunsa -and ajeets voice was con-
strained in its deadliness- that asss voice
of thine will yet bring you to grief
  but sookdee interposed
   let is not quarrel he said  ajeet
no doubt has in his mind bootea as i have
meena and it would be well if the two
were sent on the road in the cart and
when our work is completed we will follow
indeed they may know nothing but that
there is some jewel such as women love to
be given them
   look you cried hunsa thrusting his
coarse hand out toward the road  even
bhowanee is in favor see vou not the
jackal
   turning their eyes in the direction hunsa
indicated a jackal was seen slinking across
the road from right to left
   indeed it is an omen sookdee corro-
borated  if on our journeys to commit a
decoitv that is always a good omen
   and there is the voice hunsa ex-
claimed as the tremulous lowing of a cow
issued from the village
  he waved a beckoning hand to guru
lai for they had brought with them their
tribal priest as an interpreter of omens
chiefly  is not the voice of the cow heard
at sunset a good omen guru he de-
manded
    indeed it- is the priest affirmed  if
the voice of a cow is heard issuing at twi-
light from a village at which decoits are to
profit it is surely a promise from bhowanee
that a large store of silver will be obtained
 take thee to thy prayers guru ajeet
commanded  for we have matters to set-
tle he turned to sookdee  your omens
rill avail little if there is prosecution over
caste

the disappearance of the merchant i am
supposed to be in command the leader but
i am the led i will not withdraw and
it is not the place of the chief to handle
the roomal we will eat our food and
after the evening prayers will sit about the
fire and amuse this merchant with stories
such as honest men and holy ones con-
verse in that he may be at peace in his
mind as sookdee says the women will be
sent to the grove of trees we came through
on the road
   we will gather about the fire of the
merchant sookdee declared  for it is in
the mango grove and hidden from the sight
of the villagers also a guard will be placed
between here and the village and one upon
the roadway
   and while we hold the merchant in
amusement hunsadded  men will dig
the pits here two of them each within a
tent so that they will not be seen at work
 yes ajeet sookdee said with a sus-
picion of a sneer  we will give the mer-
chant the consideration of a decent burial
and not leave him to be eaten by jackals
and hyenas as were the two soldiers you
finished with your sword when we robbed
the camel transport that carried the british
gold in oudh
    if it is to be cease to chatter like jays
ajeet answered crossly
  in keeping with their assumed characters
the evening meal was ushered in with a
peace-shattcring clamor from the drums
and a raucous blare from conch-shell horns
then the devout murderers offered up
prayers of fervency to the great god be-
seeching their more immediate branch of
the deity bhovanee to protect them
  and at the same time just within the
mud walls of sarorra its people were plac-
ing flowers and coconuts and sweetmeats
upon the shrine of the god of their village
  just without the village gate the ele-
phant-nosed ganesh sat looking in whim-
sical good nature across his huge paunch
toward the place of crime the deep shadow
that lay beneath the green-leafed mango
trees
  in the hearts of the bagrees there was
unholy joy an eager anticipation a glad-
some feeling toward bhowanee who had
certainly guided this rapacious merchant
with his iron box full of jewels to their
camp indeed they would sacrifice a buf-
falo at her temple of kajuria for that was
the habit of their clan when the booty was
great the taking of life was but an inci-
dent in hindustan humans came up like
flies returning over and over to again en-
cumber the crowded earth in the vicissi-
tudes of life before long the merchant
would pass for a reincarnation of his soul
and probably because of his sins as an op-
pressor of the poor come back as a turtle
or a jackass certainly not as a revered
cow-he was too unholy in the gradation
of humans he was but a merchant of the
caste of the third dimension in the great
quartet of castes it would not be like
killing a brahmin a sin in the sight of the
great god
  this philosophy was as subtle as the per-
fume of a rose unspoken even at the mo-
ment a floaty thought like their small
hands and their erect air of free men-the
rajput atmosphere-it had grown into
their created being like the hunting in-
stinct of a rampore hound
  the merchant smoking his hookah hav-
ing eaten observed with keen satisfaction
the evening devotions of the supposed
mendicants as it grew dark their guru
was offering up a prayer to the holy cow
for she was to be worshiped at night the
merchants appreciation was largely a
worldly one a business sense of insurance
-safety for his jewels and nothing to pay
for security-men so devout would have
the gods in their mind and not robbery
when the jamadars and some of the
bagrees who were good story tellers and
one a singer did him the honor of coming
to sit at his camp fire he was pleased
   sit you here at my right he said to
hunsa for he conceived him to be captain
of the rajahs guard
  sookdee and the others without appar-
ent motive contrived it so that a bagree
or two sat between each of the merchants
men engaging them in pleasant speech
tendering tobacco and as if in modesty
some of the bagrees sat behind the retain-
ers
   this is indeed a courtesy the mer-

argosy-allstory weekly
chant assured hunsa  a poor trader feels
honored by a visit from so brave a soldier
as the captain of the rajahs guard
  he noticed too with inward satisfac-
tion that the jamadars had left their weap-
ons behind which they had done in a way
of not arousing their victims fears
   would not it be deemed a courtesy
the merchant asked  if one like myself
who is a poor trader should go to pay his
respects to the rajah ere he retires for of
course it would be beneath his dignity to
come to his servant
   no indeed declared hunsa quickly
thinking of the graves that were even then
being dug  he is a man of a haughty
temper and when he is in the society of the
beautiful dancing girl who is with him he
cares not to be disturbed even now he is
about to escort her in the cart down the
road to where there is a shrine that women
of that caste make offering to
  it had been arranged that ajeet would
escort bootea with two bagrees as attend-
ants to the grove of trees half a mile down
the road he had insisted on this in the
way of a negative support to the murder
as there would be no fighting this did not
reflect on his courage as a leader and as
to complicity hunsa knew that as the
leader of the party ajeet would be held
the chief culprit it was always the leader
of a gang of decoits who was beheaded
when captured the others perhaps escaping
with years of jail and hunsa himself even
sookdee would be safe for they were in
league with the dewan
  there was an hour of social talk many
times hunsa fingered the roomal that was
about his waist the yellow and white stran-
gling cloth with which bhowanee had com-
manded her disciples the thugs to kill their
victims in one comer of it was tied a sil-
ver rupee for luck the natural ferocity of
his mind threw him into an eager anticipa-
tion he took pride in his proficiency as a
strangler his coarse heavy hands like
those of a punjabi wrestler were suited to
the task grasping the cloth at the base of
a victims skull tight to the throat a side-
twist inward and the trick was done the
spine snapped like a pipe stem and he
had been somewhat out of practice-he re-
gretted that he was fearful of losing the
art the knack
  around the fat paunch of the merchant
was a silver-studded belt hunsa eyed this
speculatively beyond doubt in its neigh-
borhood would be the key to the iron box
and when its owner lay on his back his
bulbous eyes glaring upward to where the
moon trickled through the thick foliage of
the mango tree beneath which they sat he
would seize the keys and be the first to
dabble his grimy fingers in the glittering
gems
  beyond the village had hushed the stri-
dent call of voices had ceased somewhere
a woman was pounding grain in a wooden
mortar-a dull monotonous thud thud
swish thud carrying on the dead air night-
jars were circling above the trees their
plaintive call  chy-eece chy-e-ece filter-
ing downward like the weird cry of spirits
once the deep sonorous bugling note of the
saums like the bass pipe of an organ smote
the stillness as the giant crane winged its
way up the river that lay beyond a mighty
ribbon of silver in the moonlight a jackal
from the far side of the village in the fields
raised a tremulous moan
  sookdee looked into the eyes of hunsa
and he understood it was the tibao the
happiest augury of success for it came
over the right shoulder of the victim
  hunsa feeling that the moment to strike
had come rose carelessly saying  give
me tobacco
  that was a universal signal among thugs
the command to strike
  even as he uttered the words hunsa had
slipped behind the merchant and his towel
was about the victims neck each man
who had been assigned as a strangler had
pounced upon his individual victim while
sookdee stood erect a knife in his hand
ready to plunge it into the heart of any
one who was likely to overcome his assail-
ant
  hunsa had thrown the helpless merchant
upon his face and with one knee between
his shoulder blades had broken the neck
no sound beyond the gurgling breath of
strangulation had passed the hindus lips-
there had been no clamor no outer
nothing but a few smothered words gasps
                         	a
caste

the scuffle of feet upon the earth it was
like a horrible nightmare a fantastic orgy
of murderous fiends the flame of the
camp fire flickered sneers drawn torture
red and green shadows in the staring faces
of the men who lay upon the ground and
the figures of the stranglers glowed red in
its light like devils who danced in hell
  hunsa had turned the merchant upon
his back and his evil gorilla face was thrust
into the face of his victim no breath
passed the thick protruding lips upon
which was the froth of death
  as the jamadar tore the keys from the
waist band snapping a silver chain that
was about the body he said  sookdee
be quick have the bodies carried to the
pits do not forget to drive a spear through
each belly lest they swell up and burst
open the earth
   you have the keys to the chest
hunsa sookdee said with suspicion in
his voice
   yes jamadar i will open it we will
empty it and place the iron box on top of
the bodies in a pit for it is too heavy to
carry and if we are stopped it might be
observed
   take the dead sookdee commanded
the bagrees  lay them out take down the
tents that are over the pits and by that
time i will be there to count these dead
things in the way of surety that not one
has escaped with the tale
   come he said to hunsa  together
we will go to the iron box and open it
then there can be no suspicion that the men
of alwar have been defrauded
  hunsa turned malignant eyes upon sook-
dee but keys in hand strode tow-ard the
tent
  sookdee thrusting in the fire a torch
made from the feathery bark of the kujoor
tree followed
  hunsa kneeling before the iron box was
fitting the keys into the double locks then
he threw the lid backward and the two
gasped at a glitter of precious stones that
lay beneath a black velvet cloth hunsa
stripped from the gems
  sookdee cried out in wonderment and
hunsa slobbering gutturals of avarice pat-
ted the gems with his gorilla paws he
 a
lifted a large square emerald entwined in
a tracery of gold delicate as the crisscross
of a spiders web and held it to his thick
lips
   a bribe for a princess  he gloated
 take you this sookdee and hide it as
you would your life for as gift to the son
of the peshwa who methinks is behind the
dewan in this we will be men of honor
and this -a gleaming diamond in a cir-
clet of gold- for sirdar baptiste and
he rolled it in his loin cloth  and this 
-a string of pearls that as he laid it on
the black velvet was like the tears of
angels- this for the fat pig of a dewan
to set his four wives at each others throats
let not the others know of these sookdee
of these that we have taken for the ac-
count
  suddenly there was a clamor of voices
cries the clang of swords the sharp crash
of a shot and the two jamadars startled
eyes staring stood with ears cocked toward
the tumult
   soldiers  sookdee gasped his hand
brushed hunsas bare arm as he thrust it
into the chest and brought it forth clasp-
ing jewels which he tied in a knot of his
waistcloth  take you something hunsa
and lock the box till we see he said dart-
ing from the tent
  hunsa filled a pocket of his brocaded
jacket but he was looking for the akbar
lamp the ruby he lifted out a tray and
ran his grimy hands through the maze of
gold- and silver-wrought ornaments below
his fingers touched at the very bottom a
bag of leather he tore it open and a
blaze of blood-red light glinted at him
evilly where a ruby caught the flame of the
torch that sookdee had thrown to the earth
floor as he fled
  with a snarl of gloating he rolled the
ruby in a fold of his turban locked the
box and darted after sookdee
   he all but fell over the seven dead bodies
of the merchant and his men as he raced
to where a group was standing beyond
and there three more bodies lay upon the
ground and beside them held were two
horses
    it is ajeet singh sookdee said point-
ing to where the chief lay with his head in

argosy-allstory weekly
the lap of a decoit  these two native sol-
diers of the english came riding in with
swiftness for behind them raced ajeet
who must have seen them pass
	 and here another added  as the
riders checked at sight of the dead ajeet
pulled one from his horse and killed him
but the other with a pistol shot ajeet and
he is dead
   the chief is not dead said the one
who held his head in his lap he is but
shot in the shoulder and  have stopped
the blood with my hand
    and we have killed the other soldier
another said for having seen the bodies
we could not let him live
  from sookdees hand dangled a coat of
one of the dead
    this that is a leather purse he said
 contains letters the red thing on them i
have looked upon before-it is the seal of
the englay it was here in the coat of
that one who is a sergeant-the other be-
ing a soldier
   he put the leather case within the bosom
of his shirt adding  this may even be of
value to the dewan beyond that there
was little of loot upon these dogs of the
englay-eight rupees the coats and the
turbans we will burn
  hunsa stooped down and slipped the
sandals from the feet of the one sookdee
had pointed out as the officer
    the footwear is of little value but we
will take the brass cooking pots of the mer-
chant sookdee said eying this perform-
ance there was suspicion in his eyes lighted
from the flare of their camp fires
   sookdee hunsa said  you have the
englay leather packet but they do not
send sowars through the land of the mah-
ratta with the real message written on the
back of the messenger in quiet i will rip
apart the soles of this footwear do you
that with the saddles therein is often hid-
den the true writing in the slaying of
these two we have acquired a powerful
enemy the english and the message if
there be one might be traded for our lives
here are the keys to the box for it is
heavy
  into hunsas mind had flashed the
thought that the gods had opened the way
for he had plotted to do this thing-the
destruction of ajeet
   have all the bodies thrown into the
pit sookdee he advised  make perfect
the covering of the fire and ash and while
you prepare for flight i will go and bring
booteas cart to carry ajeet
  then hunsa was swallowed up in the
gloom of the night melting like a shadow
into the white haze of the road as he raced
like a gray wolf toward the gulab who
now had certainly been delivered into his
hands
  soon his heart pumped and the choke of
exertion slowed him to a fast walk the
sandals bulky with their turned-up toes
worried him he drew a knife from his
sash and slit the tops off muttering  if
it is here the message of value it will be
between the two skins of the soles
  now they lay flat and snug in his hand
as he quickened his pace
chapter ix
spawn of a she-leopard
the gulab heard the shot at the ba-
gree camp and hunsa found her
trembling from apprehension
   what has happened jamadar she
cried  ajeet heard the beat of iron-shod
hoofs upon the road and seeing in the
moonlight the two riders knew from the
manner they sat the saddles that they were
of the englay service when he called to
them they heeded him not then ajeet fol-
lowed the two why was the shot hunsa
   they have killed ajeet hunsa de-
clared  but also they are dead and i have
the leaders leather sandals for a purpose
the shot has roused the village and even
now our people are preparing for flight get
you into the cart that i may take you to
safety he took the ruby from his tur-
ban saying  and here is the most beau-
tiful ruby in hind the fat pig of a dewan
wants it but i have taken it for you
  but bootea pushed his hand away  i
take no present from you hunsa
   hunsa put the jewel back in his turban
and commanded the two men who stood
waiting  make fast the bullocks to the
caste

cart quickly lest we be captured because
other soldiers are coming behind
  the two bagrees turned to where the
slim pink-and-gray coated trotting bullocks
were tethered by their short horns to a tree
and leading them to the cart made fast the
bamboo yoke across their necks
   get into the cart bootea hunsa com-
manded for the girl had not moved
  i will not she declared im going
back to ajeet he is not dead-it is a
trick
   he is dead hunsa snarled seizing her
by the arm
  the gulab screamed words of denuncia-
tion  take your hands off me son of a
pig accursed man of low caste ajeet will
kiu you for this dog
  at this the wife of sookdee fled racing
back toward the camp one of the men
darted forward to follow but hunsa stayed
him saying let her go-it is better
i war not upon sookdee
  he had the gulab now in the grasp of
both his huge paws and holding her tight
said rapidly  be still you she-devil ac-
cursed fool you are going to a palace to
be a queen the son of the peshwa de-
sires you true i also have desire but
fear not for by bhowanee it is a life of
glory of jewels and rich attire that i take
you to so get into the cart
  but bootea wrenched free an arm and
struck hunsa full upon his ugly face
screaming her rebellion
 to be struck by a woman hunsa
blared  not a woman but the spawn
of a she-leopard why should not i beat
your beautiful face into ugliness with one
of these sandals of a dead pig
  he lifted her bodily calling to the man
upon the ground the other having mounted
behind the bullocks  put back the leather
wall of the cart that i may hurl this out-
cast widow of a dead hindu within
  bootea clawed at bis face she kicked
and fought her voice screaming a call to
ajeet
  there was a heavy rolling thump of
hoofs upon the roadway unheard by hunsa
because of the vociferous struggle then
from the shimmer of moonlight thrust the
white form of a big turkoman horse that
was thrown almost to his haunches his
breast striking the back of the decoit
  the bullocks nervous little brutes
startled by the huge white animal swerved
and before the man who sat astraddle of
the one shaft gathered tight the cord to
their nostrils whisked the cart to the road-
side where it toppled over the bank for a
fall of fifteen feet into a ravine carrying
bullocks and driver with it
  the moonlight fell full upon the face of
the horseman its light making still whiter
the face of captain barlow
  and bootea recognized him it was the
face that had been in her vision night and
day since the nautch
   save me sahib she cried  these
men are thieves save me sahib
  the hunting crop in barlows hand
crashed upon the thick head of hunsa in
ready answer to the appeal and as the
sahib threw himsef from the saddle the
jamadar with a snarl like a wounded tiger
dropped the girl and whirling grappled
with the englishman
  barlow was strong few men in the force
certainly none in the officers mess could
put him on his back and he was lithe
supple as a leopard and in combat cool his
mind working like the mind of a chess
player but he realized that the arms about
him were the arms of a gorilla the chest
against which he was being crushed was the
chest of a trained wrestler a smaller man
would have heard his bones cracking in that
clutch
  he raised a knee and drove it into the
groin of the jamadar then in the slight
slackening of the holding arms as the ba-
gree shrunk from the blow he struck at the
bearded chin it was the clean trained
short-arm jab of a boxer
  but even as the gorilla wavered stagger-
ingly under the blow a soft something
slipped about barlows throat and tightened
like the coils of a python and behind
something was pressing him to his death
the other bagree springing to the assist-
ance of hunsa had looped his roomal about
the sahibs throat with the deft art of a
thug
  barlows senses were going his brain
swam in his fancy he had been shot from a

argosy-allstory weekly
cliff and was hurtling through space in
which there was no air-his lungs had
closed in his brain a hammer was beating
him into unconsciousness
  then suddenly the pressure on his throat
ceased it fell away tfie air rushed to the
parched lungs with a wrench his brain
cleared and he went down-but now with
power in his arms the arms that still clung
about the dazed hunsa and he was on top
  scarce aware of the action out of a fight-
ing instinct he dragged from its holster
his heavy pistol and beat with its butt the
ugly head beneath beat it till it was still
then he staggered to his feet and looked
wonderingly at the form of the b agree be-
hind who lay sprawled on the road a great
red splash across his breast
  in the gulabs hand was still clutched
the dagger she had drawn from her girdle
and driven home to save the sahib who had
sat like a god in her heart with the other
hand she held out from contact with her
limbs the muslin sari that was crimsoned
where the blood of the bagree had foun-
tained when she drew forth her knife
  barlow darted forward as bootea reeled
and caught her with an arm close the
face fair as that of a memsahib in the
pallor of fright and the paling moonlight
sweet of finer mold more spiritual than
the mona lisas puritanically simple the
mass of black hair drawn straight back
from the low broad brow-for the rich
turban had fallen in her fight for freedom
-woke memory in the sahib and as the
blood ebbed back through the girls veins
the pale cheeks flushed with rose her eye-
lids quivered and drew back their shutters
from eyes that were like those of an ante-
lope
   you-you gulab the giver of the red
rose the singer of the love song barlow
gasped
   yes captain sahib you who are like
a god- bootea checked herself- her head
drooped
  but barlow putting his fingers under
her chin and gently lifting the face asked
 and what-what
   you came like one in a dream also
sahib i am but one who danced before vou
and you have saved me
 and little girl you saved my life
he felt a shudder run through the girls
form and then she pushed him from her
crying  sahib-hunsa quick
  for the jamadar recovering his senses
had risen to his knees fumbling at his belt
groggily for his knife
  barlow swung the pistol from its holster
and rushed toward hunsa but the latter
at sight of the dreaded weapon fled pur-
sued for a few paces by the captain
  the girl saw the sandal soles lying upon
the ground where hunsa had dropped them
in the struggle and slipped them beneath
her breast-belt a quick thought coming to
her that if the captain saw them he might
recognize them as the footwear of the sol-
diers also hunsa had said they were for a
purpose
  barlow followed the fleeing shadow for a
dozen strides then his pistol barked and
swinging on his heel he came back saying
with a little laugh that was just to
frighten the beggar so he wouldnt come
back
  but booteas eyes went wide now with a
new fear the sound of the shot would
travel faster even than the fleeing hunsa
and if the decoits came-for already they
would be making ready for the road-this
beautiful god with eyes like stars and a
voice of music would be killed would be
no more than the bagree lying on the road
who was but carrion in her heart was a
new thing the struggle with hunsa the
fright even the horribleness of the blood
upon her knife was washed away by a hot
surging flood of exquisite happiness the
hindu name for love- a pain in the
heart -was veritably hers in its intensity
the sahibs arm about her when she had
closed her eyes had caused her to feel as
if she were being lifted to heaven
  she laid a hand on barlows arm and her
eyes were lifted pleadingly to his  you
must go sahib-mount your horse and go
because-
   because of what
   there are many and you will be killed
hunsa will bring others
   others-who are they
  but the gulab had turned from him and
was listening her eyes turned to the road
caste

up wucn floated from beyond upon the
hushed silence that was about them-that
seemed deeper because of the dead man
lying in the moonlight-the beat of hunsas
feet on the road once there was the whin-
ing note of wheels that claimed a protest
from a dry axle once there was a clang as
if steel had struck steel and on the dron-
ing through the night hush was a rasping
hum as if voices clamored in the distance
this was the beehive stirring of the startled
village
   what is it bootea barlow asked
the deep full eyes raised to his face
were full of fright a pleading fright
 sahib she answered  do not ask-just
go because-
   yes girl why
   that this is dead -and her hand
gestured toward the slain bagree- and
that others are dead is but you-will you
mount the horse and go back the way you
came sahib
  her small fingers clutched the sleeve of
the coat he wore-it was of hunting cloth
red and green  others are dead yonder
and evil is in the hearts of those that live
go sahib-please go
  barlows mind was racing fast in more
materialistic grooves than the gulabs
there was something about it he didnt un-
derstand something the girl did not want
to tell him some horrible thing that she
was afraid of-her face was full of sup-
pressed dread
  suddenly through no sequence of reason-
ing-in fact there was no data to go upon-
nothing except that a girl-the gulab was
just that-stood there afraid-through him
she had just escaped from a man who was
little more than an ape-stood quivering in
the moonlight alone except for himself
so suddenly he acted as if energized by
logic as if mental deduction made plain
the way
   you are right he said  we must go
he laid a hand upon the bridle rein of
the gray that had stood there in submission
saying  come bootea
  foot m stirrup he swung to the saddle
and as the gray turned he reached down
both hands saying  come ill take you
wherever you want to go
  but the girl drew back and shook her
beautifully modeled head-the delicate
head with the black hair smoothed back to
simplicity-and her voice was half sob
 it cant be sahib i am but- she
checked to speak of the decoits even
might lead to talk that would cause the
sahib to go to their camp and he would be
killed and she would be a witness to testify
against her own people the slayers of the
sepoys
  barlow laughed  because you are a
girl who dances you are not to be saved
eh he said  but listen-the sahibs do
not leave women at the mercy of villains
you must come and his strong sun-
browned hands were held out
  bootea wonderingly as if some god had
called to her put her hands in barlows
and with a twist of his strong arms she was
swung across his knees
   put your arms about my waist gulab
he said as the gray to the tickle of a spur
turned to the road  dont lean away
from me he said presently  because we
have a long way to go and that tires
thats better girl as her warm breast
pressed against his body
  the big gray with a deep breath and a
sniffle of satisfaction scenting that his
head was turned homeward paced along
the ghost strip of roadway in long free
strides even when a jackal or it might
have been a honey badger slipped across
the road in front a drifting shadow the
turkoman only rattled the snafflebit in his
teeth cocked his ears and then blew a
breath of disdain from his big nostrils
  in the easy swinging cradle of the
horses stride the minds of both barlow
and the gulab relaxed into restfulness her
arms about the strong body bootea felt as
if she clung to a tower of strength-that
she was part of a magnetic power and
the nightmare that had been so short a
time since had floated into a dream of con-
tent of glorious peace
  barlow was troubling over the problem
of the gorilla-faced man and thinking how
close he had been to death-all but gone
out except for that figure in his arms that
was so like a lotus and the death would
have meant not just the forfeit of his life

argosy -allstory weekly
but that his duty the mission he was upon
for his own people the british government
had been jeopardized by his participation
in some native affair of strife something he
had nothing to do with he had ridden
along that road hoping to overtake the two
riders that now lay dead in the pit with
the other victims of the thugs-of which he
knew nothing they were bearing to him
a secret message from his government and
he had ridden to manabad there to take it
from them lest in approaching the city of
the peshwa full of seditious spies and cut-
throats the paper might be stolen but at
manabad he had learned that the two had
passed had ridden on and then perhaps
because of converging different roads he
had missed them
   but most extraordinarily just one of the
 curious tangented ways of fate the writ-
 ten order lay against his chest sewn be-
 tween the double sole of a sandal once or
 twice the hard leather caused him to turn
 slightly the girls body and he thought it
 some case in which she carried jewels
chapter x
the sweet pain in the heart
they had gone perhaps an eighth of
a mile when the road they followed
joined another joined in an arrow-
head the gray turned to the left to the
west the homing instinct telling him that
that way lay his stall in the city of the
peshwa
    this was the way of my journey
bootea barlow said  i rode from yon-
der and he nodded back toward the high-
way into which the two roads wedged  it
was here that i heard your call the call of
a woman in dread also it might have been
a business that interested me if it had been
a matter of waylaying travelers did you
see two riders of large horses such as arabs
or of the breed i ride men who rode as do
sowars
    no sahib i did not see them
   this was not a lie for it was ajeet who
had seen them and because of the sahibs
interest she knew the two men must have
been of his command and if she spoke of
them undoubtedly the sahib would go back
and be killed
   were they servants of yours sahib-
these men who rode
  barlow gave off but a little sliver of
truth  no he answered  but at man-
abad men spoke of them passing this way
journeying to poona and if they were
strangers to this district it might be that
they had taken the wrong road at the fork
but if you did not see them they will be
ahead
   and meaning sahib it would not be
right if they saw you bearing on your horse
one who is not a mem sahib
   as to that gulab what might be
thought by men of low rank is of no conse-
quence
   but if the sahib wishes to overtake
them my burden upon the horse will be an
evil and he will be sorry that bootea had
not shame sufficient to refuse his help
  she felt the strong arm press her body
closer and heard him laugh but still he
did not answer did not say why he was
interested in the two horsemen if it
were vital-and she believed it was-for
him to know that they lay dead at the
bagree camp it was wrong for her not
to tell him this he who was a preserver
but to tell him would send him to his
death she knew as all the people of
that land knew that the sahibs went
where their rajah told them was their mis-
sion and laughed at death and the face of
this one spoke of strength and the eyes of
placid fearlessness so she said nothing
  the sandal soles that pinched her soft
flesh she felt were a reproach-they had
something to do with the thing that was
between the sahib and the dead soldiers
there were tears in her eyes and she shiv-
ered
   barlow feeling this said  youre cold
gulab the night wind that comes up
from the black muck of the cotton fields
and across the river is raw hang on for
a minute he added as he slipped his arm
from about her shoulders and fumbled at
the back of his saddle a couple of buckles
were unclasped and he swung loose a warm
military cloak and wrapped it about her
his cheek brushing hers as he did so
caste

  then she was like a bird lying against his
chest closed in from everything but just
this sahib who was like a god
  a faint perfume lingered in barlows
nostrils from the contact it was the per-
fume of attar of the true oil of rose such
as only princes use because of its costliness
and he wondered a little
  she saw his eyes looking down into hers
and asked  what is it sahib-what dis-
turbs you if it is a question ask me
  his white teeth gleamed in the moon-
light  just nothing that a man should
bother over-that he should ask a woman
about
  but almost involuntarily he brushed his
face across her black hair and said  just
that gulab-that its like burying ones
nose in a rose
   the attar sahib i love it because its
gentle
   ah thats why you wore the rose that
i came by at the tiautch
   yes sahib though i am bootea be-
cause of a passion for the rose i am called
gulab
   lovely-the rose thats just what
you are gulab but the attar is so costly
are you a princess in disguise
   xo sahib but one brought me many
bottles of it the slim long bottles like a
finger and a drop of it lasts for a moon
   ah i see and barlow smiled  you
have for lover a rajah the one who brought
the attar
  the figure in the cloak shivered again
but the girl said nothing and barlow
rather to hear her voice for it was sweet
like flute music chaffed what is he
like-the one that you love a swagger-
ing tall black-whiskered rajput no doubt
with a purple vest embroidered in gold
clanking with tulwar and a voice like a
brahmini bull-full of demand
  the slim arms about his waist tightened
a little-that was all
   confess gulab it will pass the time
a love story is sweet and brahm who cre-
ates all things creates flowers beautiful
and sweet to stir love and he shook the
small body reassuringly
  sahib when a girl dances before the
great ones to please it is permitted that she
may play at being a princess to win the
favor of a rajah and sing the love song to
the music of the sitar guitar but it is a
matter of shame to speak it alone to the
presence
   tell me gulab his strong fingers
swept the smooth black hair
  the girl unclasped her arms from about
barlows waist and led his fingers to a
harsh iron bracelet upon her arm
  at the touch of the cold metal iron em-
blem of a child marriage a shackle never
to be removed he knew that she was a
widow accounted by brahminical caste an
offense to the gods an outcast because if
the husband still lived she would be in a
zcnanna of gloomy walls and not one who
danced as she had at xana sahibs
   and the man to whom you were bound
by your parents died he asked
   i am a widow sahib as the iron brace-
let testifies with cold bitterness it is the
badge of one who is outcast of one who has
not become sati has not sat on the wood to
find death in its devouring flame
  barlow knew all the false logic the meta-
physical machiavellians the brahmins ad-
vanced to thin out the undesirable females
-women considered at all times in that
land of overpopulation of less value than
men-by the simple expedient of self-de-
struction he knew the brahmins thesis
culled from their word of god the vedas
or the puranas calculated to make the
widow a voluntary willing suicide they
would tell bootea that owing to having
been evil in former incarnations her sins
had been visited upon her husband had
caused his death that in a former life she
had been a snake or a rat
  the dead husbands mother had bootea
come to an age to live with him though
yet but a child of twelve years would on
the slightest provocation beat her-even
brand her with a hot iron he had known
of it having been done she would be
given but one meal a day-rice and chillis
even if she had not yet left her fathers
house he would look upon her as a shame-
ful thing an undesirable member of the
family one not to be rid of again in the
way of marriage for if a hindu married
her it would break his caste-he would be

argosy-allstory weekly
a veritable pariah no servant would
serve him no man would sell him any-
thing if he kept a shop no one would buy
of him no one would sit and speak with
him-he would be ostracized
  the only life possible for the girl would
be that of a prostitute she might be mar-
ried by the temple priests to the god khan-
doka as thousands of widows had been
and thus become a nun of the temple a
prostitute to the celibate priests know-
ing all this and that bootea was what she
was her face and eyes holding all that
sweetness and cleanness that she lived in
the guardianship of ajeet singh very much
a man barlow admired her the more in
that she had escaped moral destruction
her face was the face of one of high caste
she was not like the ordinary nautch girl of
the fourth caste everything about bootea
suggested breeding quality the iron
bracelet indicated why she had socially
passed down the scale-there was no doubt
about it
   i understand gulab he said the
sahibs all understand and know that
widowhood is not a reproach
   but the sahib questioned of love-and
how can one such know of love the heart
starves and does not grow for it feeds upon
love-what we of hind call the sweet pain
in the heart
   but have none been kind gulab
pleased by your flower face-has no one
warmed your heart
  the slim arms that gripped barlow in a
new tightening trembled the face that fled
from the betraying moonlight was buried
against his tunic and the warm body quiv-
ered from sobs
  barlow turned her face up and the
moonlight showed vagrant pearls that lay
against the olive cheeks now tinted like
the petals of a rose then from a service
point of view and as a matter of caste
barlow went ghazi he drooped his head
and let his lips linger against the girls eyes
and uttered a superb commonplace
 dont cry little girl he said  i am
seven kinds of a brute to bother you
  and bootea thought it would have been
better if he had driven a knife into her
heart and sobbed with increased bitter-
ness once her fingers wandered up search-
ingly and touched his throat
  barlow casting about for the wherefore
of his madness discovered the moonlight
and heard the soft night air whispering
through the harp chords of trees that threw
a tracery of black lines across the white
road and from a grove of mango trees
came the gentle scent of their blossoms
and he remembered that statistics had it
that there was but one mcmsahib to so
many square miles in that land of expatria-
tion and he knew that he was young and
full of the joy of life that a british sol-
dier was not like a man of hind who looked
upon women as cattle
  there did not obtrude into hts mental
retrospect as an accusation against this un-
warrantable tenderness the vision of the
residents daughter-almost his fiancee
indeed elizabeth was the antithesis in
physical appeal of the gentle gulab the
drawing room perhaps repartee of damas-
cus steel fineness tutored polish class
cold integrity-these things associated ad-
mirably with the unsensuous elizabeth
thoughts of her remembrances had no
place in the glamorous perfumed moon-
light
  so he set his teeth and admonished the
gray turkoman called him the decrepit son
of a donkey being without speed and to
punish him stroked his neck gently even
this forced diversion bringing him closer
to the torturing sweetness of the girl
  but now he was aware of a throbbing on
the night wind and a faint shrill note
that lay deep in the shadows beyond it
was a curious rumbling noise as though
ghosts of the hills on the night were play-
ing bowles with rounded rocks and the
shrilling skirl grew louder as if men
marched behind bagpipes
  the gulab heard it too and her body
stiffened her head thrust from the envelop-
ing cloak and her eyes showed like dark-
ened sapphires
   carts carrying cotton perhaps- he
said but presently he knew that small
cotton carts but rattled the volume of
rumbling was as if an army moved
  from up the road floated the stacatto
note of a staff beating its surface and the
caste

clanking tinkle of an iron ring against the
wooden staff
    a mail carrier barlow said
  and then to the monotonous pat-pat-pat
of trotting feet the mail carrier emerged
from the gray wall of night
   here you what comes the captain
queried checking the gray
   the postie stopped in terror at the eng-
lish voice
    salaam bahadur sahib it is war
   thou art a tree owl and barlow
laughed  a war does not spring up like
a drift of driven dust is it some rajahs
elephants and carts with his harem going
to a durbar
    sahib it is as i have said war the
big brass cannon that is called  the humbler
of cities goes forth to speak its order and
with it are sepoys to feed it the food of
destruction beyond that i know not
sahib for i am a man of peace being but
a runner of the post
  then he salaamed and sifted into the
night gloom like a thrown handful of white
sand echoing back the clamp-clamp-
clamp of his staffs iron ring which was a
signal to all cobras to move from the path
of him who ran slip their chilied folds from
the warm dust of the road
   and on in front what had been sounds of
mystery was now a turmoil of noises the
hissing screech the wails were the expos-
tulations of tortured axles the rumbling
boom was unexplainable but the jungle of
the hillside was possessed of screaming
devils black-faced white-whiskered mon-
keys roused by the din screamed cries of
hate and alarm as they scurried in volplan-
ing leaps from tree to tree and peacocks
awakened when they should have slept
called with their harsh voices from lofty
perches
   a party of villagers hurried by shifting
their cheap turbans to hide faces as they
hurried along
  the gulab was trembling perhaps the
decoits led by hunsa had come by a
shorter way for they were like beasts of
the jungle in this art of silent swift travel
   sahib she pleaded  go from the
oad
   why bootea
   the one with the staff spoke of sol-
diers
  he laughed and patted her shoulder
 dont fear little lady he said  an
army doesnt make war upon one even if
they are soldiers it will be but a wedding
party who now takes the wife to the village
of her husband
   xot at night and a sahib who carries
a woman upon his saddle will hear words
of offense
  though barlow laughed he was troubled
what if the smoldering fire of sedition had
flared up and that even now men of sind-
hias were slipping on a night march toward
some massing of rebels the resonant
heavy moaning of massive wheels was like
the rumble of a gun carriage and too
there was the drumming of many hoofs
upon the road barlows ear told him it
was the rhythmic beat of cavalry horses
not the erratic rat-a-tat rat-a-tat of native
ponies
  with a pressure upon the rein he edged
the gray from the white road to a fringe of
bamboo and date palms saying  if you
will wait here gulab ill see what this is
all about
   he slipped from the saddle and lifted her
gently to the ground saying  dont
move of a certainty it is nothing but the
passing of some rajah but if by any
chance i dont return wait until all is still
until all have gone and then some well-
disposed driver of a bullock cart will take
you on your way putting his hand in
his pocket and drawing it forth he added
 here is the compeller of friendship-sil-
ver for a bribe even an enemy will be-
come a friend
  but the gulab with her slim fingers
closed his hand over the rupees and pressed
the back of it against her lips saying  if
i die it is nothing but stay here sahib
they may be-
  she stopped and he asked  may be
whom gulab
   men who will harm thee
   but barlow lifting to the saddle passed
to the road and bootea crumpled down in
a little desolate heap of misery her fingers
thrust within her bodice pleading with an
amulet for protection for the sahib she

argosy-allstory weekly
prayed to her own village god to breathe
mercy into the hearts of those who marched
in war and if it were the bagrees that
bhowanee would vouchsafe them an omen
that to harm the one on a white horse
would bring her wrath upon their families
and iheir villages
  captain barlow reined in the gray on the
 roadside for these that marched were dose
 now he could see two abreast horses that
 carried cavalrymen ten couples of the
 troop rode by with low-voiced exchanges
 oi words among themselves a petty offi-
 cer rode at their heels and behind him on
 a bay arab whose sweated skin glistened
 like red wine in the moonlight came a
 risid-ir the commander of the troop a
 little down the read barlow could see an
 undulating swaying huge ribbon of white-
 and-pink bullocks twenty-four yoke of the
 tall lean-flanked powerful omrit mchcl
 the breed that hyder ali long ago had
 brought on his conquering way to the land
 of the mahrattas and beyond the ghost-
 like line of white creatures was some huge
 thing that they drew
   the commander reined his arab to a
 stand beside barlow and saluted saying
  salaam major sahib-you ride alone
   barlow said  my salaams risaladcr
 and i am but a captain i ride at night be-
 cause the days are hot my two men have
 gone before me because my horse dropped
 a shoe which had to be replaced did the
 tisucdar see my two servants that were
 mounted
    i met none such the commander
  answered  perhaps in some village they
  have rested for a drink of liquor they of
  the army are given to such practices when
  their capiains eye is not upon them i go
  with this- and he waved a gauntleted
  hand back toward the thing that loomed
  beyond the bullocks that had now come to
  a halt  it is the brass cannon the like
  of which there is no other we go to the
  ramp of the am who commands the sind-
  hia troops takhjg him the brass cannon
  that it may compel a musselman zemindar
  to pay the tax that is long past due why
  the barbarian should not pay i know not
  for a tav of one-fourth is not much for a
  foreigner a debased follower of mahomet
to render unto the ruler of this land that is
the garden of the world he has shut him-
self and men up in his mud fort but when
this brass mother of destruction spits into
his stronghold a ball or two that is not
opium he will come forth or we will enter
by the gate the cannon has made
   then there will be bloodshed riiila-
dcr barlow declared
    true captain sahib but that is after
a manner the method of collecting jnst
dues in this land where those who till the
soil now were but a generation or two
since men of the sword-they cant forget
the traditions in the land of the british
rajah six inches of a pper with the big seal
duly affixed would do the business that
i know for i hve traveled far sahib as
to the bloodshed worse wil be the tram-
pling of crops for in the district of this
worshiper of mahomet the wheat grows
like wild scrub in the jungle taller than up
to the belly of my horse that is the whv-
fore of the cannon in a way of speaking
because from a hill we can send to this man
a slaying message and leave the wheat
standing to fill the bellies of those who are
in his hands as a tyrant sirdar baptiste
was for sending a thousand sepcys to put
the fear of destruction in the debtor but
the dewan with his eye on revenue from
crops hit upon this plan of the loud-voiced
one of brass
  then the commander ordered the ad-
vance and saluting said  salam cap-
tain sahib and if i meet your servants ih
tell them that you desire their presence
when the huge cannon had rumbled by
and behind it had passed a company of
sepoys on foot barlow turned his horse
into the jungle for gulab
chapter xi
somewhat of a fool-
booteas eyes glistened like stars
when lowering a hand barlow said
 put a foot upon mine gulab and
 swing you up
  when they were on the road she said
 i saw them it is as the runner said war
-is it so sahib
caste

 the captain says that he goes to col-
lect revenue but it may be that he spoke
a lie cor it is said that a man of the land
of the five rivers which is the punjab
has five ways of telling a tale and but one
of them is the truth and comes last
   the girl pondered over this for a little
 and then asked  does the sahib think
 perhaps it is war against his people
   that was just what was in barlows mind
 since he had seen the big gun going forth
 at night that perhaps the plot that was
 just a whisper fainter than the hum of a
 humming birds wing was moving with
 swift silent velocity
    why do you ask that question have
 you heard from lips-perhaps loosened by
 wine or desire-aught of this
   when she remained without answer bar-
 low tapped his fingers lightly upon her
 shoulder saying  tell me girl
    i have heard nothing of war she said
  there was a something though that men
 whispered in the dark
    what was it
    it was of the chief of the pindaris
   she felt the quivering start that ran
 through barlows body but he said quietly
  with the pindaris there is always trouble
 something of robbery-of a raid was it
  i will listen again to those that whis-
 per in the dark she answered  and per-
 haps if it concerns you for your protec-
 tion i will tell
    i hope those men didnt fall in with my
 two chaps barlow said rather voicing his
 thoughts than in the way of speaking to the
 girl
    the two who rode-they were the cap-
 tain sahibs servants
   barlow started  yes they were i
 suppose i can trust you
    and the sahib is troubled perhaps it
 was a message for the sahib that they car-
 ried
    i dont know he answered evasively
  i was thinking that perhaps they might
 be messengers for our sepoys are not sta-
 tioned here and come but on such errands
  and if they were killed and the mes-
 sage stolen it would cause trouble
   she felt him tremble as he looked down
 into her eyes
   i dont know but the messages of a
raj are not for the ears of men to whom
they have not been sent
  barlow had an intuition that the girls
words were not prompted by idle curiosity
he was possessed of a sudden gloomy im-
pression that she knew something of the
two men who rode and it was strange
that they had not been seen upon either of
the roads the officer spoke of them frank-
ly and not as a man hiding something
  suddenly he took a firm resolve perhaps
a dangerous one not dangerous though if
his men had really gone through
   gulab he said and with his hand he
turned her face up by the chin till their
eyes were closer together  if the two bore
a message for me and it was stolen i
would be like that one you loved and lost
the beautiful face swung from his palm
and he could hear her gasping
   you know something he said and he
caressed the smooth black tresses
   i did not see them sahib
  they rode in silence for half a mile and
then she said  perhaps sahib bootea
can help you-if the message is lost
    and you will girl
    i will sahib even if i die for doing it
i	will
  his arm tightened about her with a
shrub of assuring thankfulness and she
knew that this man trusted her and was
not sorry of her burden little child dreams
floated through her mind that the silver-
faced moon would hang there above and
light the world forever-for the moon wras
the soul of the god purusha whose sacri-
ficed body had created the world-and that
she would ride forever in the arms of this
fair-faced god and that they were both of
one caste the caste that had as mark the
sweet pain in the heart
  and barlow was sometimes dropping the
troubled thought of the missing order and
the turmoil that would be in the council of
the governor general when it became
known to mutter inwardly  by jove if
the chaps get wind of this that i carried
the gulab throughout a moonlit night
therell be nothing for me but to send in
my papers ill be drawn-my legll be
pulled and he reflected bitterly that

argosy-allstory weekly
nothing on earth no protestation no swear-
ing by the gods would make it believed as
being what it was he chuckled once pic-
turing the iace of the immaculate eliza-
beth while she thrust into him a bodkin of
moral autopsy should she come to know
of it
  bootea thought he had sighed and lay-
ing her slim fingers against his neck said
 	 the sahib is troubled
  i dont care a damn barlow ex-
claimed in english his mind still on the
personal trail
   seeing that she not understanding had
taken the sharp tone as a rebuke he said
 if i had been alone gulab i d have been
troubled sorely but perhaps the gods have
sent you to help out
    ah yes god pulled our paths together
 and if bootea is but a sacrifice that will be
 a favor she is happy
   if the girl had been of a white race in
her abandon of love she would have laid her
lips against his but the women of hind
do not kiss
   the big plate of burnished silver slid as
 if pushed by celestial fingers across the
 azure dome toward the gloomed walls of
 the ghats that it would cross to dip into
 the sea the indian ocean and mile upon
 mile was picked from the front and laid
 behind by the gray as he strode with untir-
 ing swing toward his bed that waited on
 the high plateau of poona
  the two riders felt rather sleepy-the
gulab warm and happy cuddled in the pro-
tecting cloak and barlow grim oppressed
by fatigue and the mental strain of feared
disaster now the muscles of the horse
rippled in heavier toil and his hoofs beat
the earth in shorter stride the way was
rising from the plain as it approached the
plateau that was like an immense shelf let
into the wall of the world above the low-
land a shelf that held jewels topaz and
diamonds that glinted their red and yellow
lights and upon which rested giant pearls
the moonlight silvering the domes and min-
arets of white palaces and mosques of
poona the dark hill upon which rested
the temple of parvati threw its black out-
line against the sky and like a burnished
helmet glowed gie golden dome beneath
which sat the alabaster goddess at their
feet strung out between forbidding hanfcy
of clay and sand ran a molten stream of
silver the sleepy waters of the muta
  v by jove and barlow suddenly cog-
nizant that he had practically arrived at
the end of his ride that the windmill of
don quixote stood yonder on the hill real-
ized that in a sense so far as bootea was
concerned he had just drifted now he
asked im afraid little girl your sahib
is somewhat of a fool for i have not asked
where you want me to take you
   yonder sahib and her eyes were

trepidation
  booteas hand touched his arm and she
turned her face inward to hide the hot flush
that lay upon it  xo sahib not because
of bootea one does not sleep in the lap
of a god
    all right girl he answered i- sony
  as the gray plodded tiredlv down the
avenue of trees a smooth road bordered
by a hedge of cactus and lanten barlow
turned him to the right up a drive of broken
stone and dropping to the ground at the
veranda of a white-walled bungalow lifted
the girl down saying  within it can be
arranged for a rest place for you

    oh the mech he blamed the pilot
     and the pilot blamed the ship
   but the reason for that crack-up
   wasnt water on the hip-
warbled royce grainger beating
time with much energy and some
rhythm on the agitated shoulder
of bill mcclellan  chorus bill xip
stunt slip crash a-a-a-ambulance
 shut up commanded bill emphatical-
ly  your sneaking insinuation is as un-
just as it is unmusical
  flip devans royces mechanic had
been tinkering with the motor of a stunted
scout plane on the line a hundred feet from
the hangar when the first note of the song
assailed his ears he pushed an anxious
and breathless countenance into the build-
ing where the two friends were standing
just in time to encounter the red eyes of
bill
   somebody crash royce asked him
blandly
    i guess not flip retorted after look-
ing over his superior with great care he
removed himself with some deliberation
from the fiery gaze of bill
   my motor has made me deaf often
enough but this is the first time it has made
me hear strange things royce said pulling
off his helmet and presenting an attentive
ear to the younger man  if you arent-
er-hipped rave through it again will
you
    its infernally serious bill declared
transferring his glare from the place where
flip had been to a bit of rubber hose on
the oily floor he kicked it across the shed
and watched it bounce to rest before pro-
ceeding  what a woman wants she gels
well im it this girl is a nice little girl-
fine family lots of money and so forth-
but she has taken a few things i said too
seriously ill be engaged in a week im
afraid it will be a deuced short engagement
too do you think id ask your help if i
wasnt desperate
  royce blinked


argosy-allstory weekly
    i have a reason an important reason
 for climbing out of this affair now mc-
 clellan continued  if-
   go on royce urged  i heard all
 this before but i want to see if i hear it
 again
    this girl wants me because she thinks
 aviators are heroes she doesnt like me
 because i have blue eyes an ear for jazz
 a charming personality an admiration for
 stevenson a fairly decent job or anything
 like that no she likes me because im a
 hero ugh imagine being a hero before
 breakfast-or after dinner imagine being
 heroic three hundred and sixtv-five days a
 year besides i have an important-
 well if i can get her over thinking im a
 hero its all off
   you want to reveal to her your real
 self royce asked sympathetically
    i desire to delude her into the belief
 that i am a coward and a braggart bill
 said at last with some repression
    and you need help the pilot inquired
 allowing a generous amount of incredulity
 to tinge his tone
   i do retorted mcclellan fiercely
  and im liable to prove the first part right
 now by manhandling such an insignificant
 rabbit-faced symptom of a neurasthenic
 kiwi as yourself
     which part royce said with an ap-
 preciative grin  throttle down bill i
 was just probing to discover just how bad-
 ly off you think you are
    mcclellan subsided although his feet
 continued to harass small objects on the
 floor
  i shall be pleased to cooperate with you
 for the ladys sake-i think royce re-
 sumed blandly  is the subject in ques-
 tion familiar with your war record and sub-
 sequent aeronautical career
    mcclellan made vague explanatory mo-
  tions with hands while his face assumed a
  brickish hue
     shes a good listener he muttered
  after a pause  i may have permitted
  something of it to leak out
     like gasoline out of a cheesecloth
  tank royce deduced  ah well i when
  i was young two or three years ago i too
  experienced difficulty in keeping beautiful
ladies in the dark concerning my remark-
able ability and thrilling exploits
   the hue on bills face deepened to pur-
ple as sunset fades into night he opened
his mouth then shut it again took out his
handkerchief and mopped his forehead
royce watched him attentively as one
studies a bug but relented sufficiently to
inquire
   well how are we going to show you
up
     bring her out here to the field
mcclellan burst out eagerly restoring his
handkerchief with unnecessary violence
 you take us up in that tour-sealed flam-
ingo well sit in the front cockpit you
alone in the back then start stunting a
few loops nose dive spin-anything you
think the old crate will stand ill be nor-
mal enough until you cut loose the works
then  become terrified-scream shout
hang onto the sides and beg you to stop
stunting you stop and come down in-
sult me as i scramble with quivering legs
to the ground make it strong youre
safe then take the girl aside and tell her
that although i was in the air service i
had to be grounded for cowardice shell
never speak to me again
    suppose she faints or something when
the stunts start royce objected  you
never know how a girl is going to take that
sort of thing
    shes been up and through it all i
know bill answered
     	take the matter under advisement
royce decided weightily
    youll do more than that bill mc-
clellan declared confidendy  ill bring
her down thursday and royce watch
your step the lady is apt to mistake you
for a hero too after my demise in that ca-
pacity
    it wouldnt be a mistake bill royce
answered modestly
    there was a conscience-a fairly well-
oiled conscience-inside the vigorous frame
of royce grainger this undesirable in-
strument pricked him occasionally as he
thought of the scheme bill mcclellan he
knew was a bit of a lothario and a fickle
lothario at that nevertheless he was an
old squadron mate and ties formed in the
royce assists

air are not easily disregarded on the ground
besides if some man-hunting female had
entrapped the susceptible bill it was clear-
ly his duty to stand by his sex and haul
his fellow man out of the deadfall
  that was as far as royce got with the
affair a test pilot on a busy field has little
time for indulging in moral conflict and
royce was then engaged in the dangerous
task of trying out a scout plane that flew
at the heavenly rate of one hundred and
eighty miles an hour but could only be
landed at the hellish rate of eighty-five
  thursday arrived despite his absorption
royce scrambling for words found him-
self being introduced by bill to an alto-
gether indescribable young lady her very
handclasp and smile wanned his heart de-
spite his efforts to gaze upon her icily as
a mere object which was to be stunted vig-
orously and fooled outrageously
  while he fought to conceal from her by
words the fact that he liked her from the
top of her pretty little turban to the small
soles of her shoes resentment against bill
mcclellan surged upward within him so
this blue-eyed angel-faced little girl was
the unscrupulous vampire bill claimed had
entrapped him and here was bill himself
beside her belying his words by holding her
arm by smiling down upon her with a most
offensive air of proprietorship and in other
delicate but obvious ways assuring her that
all he desired in life was that she would be
his how else could any girl interpret his
manner
  with mounting indignation royce dis-
carded the nefarious scheme of bill mc-
clellan he would do nothing that would
hurt to the heart this gentle pretty stran-
ger with the soft voice in fact-royce
threw a murderous glance at the monstrous
bill-he would be her ally if she wanted
so worthless a thing as bill mcclellan for a
husband she should have him here his
thought was halted by the voice of the
plotter
   i think we had better look over the ship
together royce bill the ingrate said
making horrible faces and stealthy gestures
royce interpreted as a desire for a secret
talk  do you mind our leaving you for
just a moment millicent
    ive tried out the controls royce an-
swered gazing coldly at the frantic signals
you take a look at the guys go ahead
see if theyd stand a little more tighten-
ing
  bill went somewhat puzzled and even
more sulky millicent with a look in her
eye that renewed royces anger watched
him walk to the machine in the hangar
    hes a good flier too isnt he the
girl asked softly
    he is royce answered violently and
treacherously
   oh said the girl smiling gratefully
but briefly up at him
   the pup said royce grimly to him-
self  shes too good for him
   he waited silently wrinkling the comers
of his eyes over the problem of delivering
into her hands the scapegrace person of bill
mcclellan
  bill came back in an incredibly short
time
   everything o k he reported and
they w-aited while mechanics trundled the
big machine out of its shed
  royce looked on morosely as bill with
great care got the girl into a leather coat
and even went so far as to fasten the leather
thong of her helmet under her chin a thing
royce had contemplated doing himself
  the conceited pup he muttered
 thinks she wants him so hes trying to
wriggle away is he ill fix him but
how
  bill made an attempt to talk to royce
behind the girls back but the pilot ignored
him royce explained at great length to
millicent the excellencies of the flamingo
he showed her everything including the
rear cockpit in which he was to sit alone
    how would you like to ride back here
he said to the girl  the machine has a
dual control system so that either of the
two seated in the rear cockpit can take con-
trol ill let you hold the stick when were
up high enough
    no i think our original plan is better
bill interfered hastily  and royce
dont stunt i mean it
   royce snorted indignantly at this last
bit of acting millicent was handed care-
fully to the front cockpit by bill royce

argosy-allstory weekly
looked over his passengers safety belts and
then clambered into one of the two seats in
the rear cockpit flip devans came to the
propeller and waited for the  switch off
of the pilot
   wait a minute said royce suddenly
and clambered out of the cockpit his two
passengers looked after him the girl curi-
ously and bill suspiciously royce trotted
to the hangar slung his own clear glass
goggles on a shelf and picked up a pair
with lenses tinted amber he put them on
and looked at his eyes in a broken mirror
then he half closed his lids and looked
again after this cryptic performance he
chuckled venting a noise like a rusty saw
biting into a box
   this is altruism he assured the
broken mirror solemnly  but she wants
him
  he hurried back to the plane wearing
the tinted goggles and vaulted into his
place without comment
   dont stunt royce bill said again
   huh said royce  switch off
contact
  the flamingo waddled forward like a
duck-a duck who was masticating dyna-
mite-quickened its pace and leaped across
the field like a grayhound and rose into the
air like an eagle the motor biting sav-
agely into its hearty meal of high-test gaso-
line and purring like a contented dinosaur
swung them ten thousand feet into the air
in twenty minutes in the front cockpit
bill pointed and shouted in unmannerly
fashion as he showed millicent the sound
the ocean the skyscrapers of manhattan
outlined against a leaden horizon and the
other sights of the great bowl in which they
were suspended occasionally one or the
other would glance back at the pilot but
all they could see was a resolute chin slit-
ted mouth and a lean nose which attended
strictly to the business of supporting the
amber-tinted goggles
  royce was flying in great circles of
which the irregular patch of green aero-
drome was the center royce continued
the upward climbing turn of the machine
far beyond the lowest height at which
stunting was reasonably safe bill mc-
clellan turned and looked at him intently
shaking his head violently and framing
words with his mouth but the pilot made
no answering sign
  only once during the long upward climb
did royces tightly closed mouth relax into
a grin that was after a final inspection
of the altimeter and a glance over the side
   wants her to think hes a coward does
he royce confided to the eighty-mile air
current that was buffeting his head  ill
show him and her too
  his left hand suddenly snapped out to
the instrument board and switched off
the motor while his right hand pushed the
control stick forward instantly the plane
headed earthward in a dangerously steep
glide at the moment the flamingo nosed
downward royce collapsed with his head
and shoulders over the side of the cockpit
his left hand dangled outside the body
while his right equally motionless remained
inside the cockpit hidden from bill and
the girl in front his right hand firmly
gripped the stick and his feet also in-
visible remained as firmly planted on the
rudder bar
   as the roar of the motor suddenly ceased
and the hum of the taut wires between the
wings rose to take its place bill and the
girl turned backward they saw the pilot
limp and half out of the plane and even
as their horrified eyes saw the hum of the
wires became a low whistle which ran
steadily up the scale as the speed of the
rush toward earth increased
  through half-closed eyes screened from
view by the amber lenses royce saw the
fright on the two faces peering backward
and upward at him then he saw bills
mouth snap shut and his shoulders heave
as he undid his safety belt bill shouted a
word of encouragement to the girl then
he pulled himself to his feet and paused for
a moment looking with a very white face
upward at the other cockpit wherein was
the inert pilot and the controls which alone
could save all three from death
  it was a scant four feet away but the
fuselage between was smooth and without
hand-holds the pitch was steep and the
plane was liable at any moment to change
its glide to an erratic fluttering fall and
below the unpiloted machine was two miles
                         	a
royce assists

of dear space that was the way the brain
behind the white face analyzed the situa-
tion royce knew
  the pause was a slight one after a
quick glance over the side at the field bill
started with clutching arms and legs up the
steep slope as he did royce his eyes
somewhat anxiously on his friend pulled
the stick back a little making the climb
less steep through the amber glasses he
watched inch by inch arms and knees
and feet gripping the broad curving frame
bill edged his way halfway and then
one of his arms shot out and gripped the
edge of the rear cockpit with a pull and
a wriggle he pulled himself head first into
the cockpit and writhed into place like
a lunging snake his feet and hand shot to
their places on the duplicate controls
   then his eyes suddenly fell on the strong
right hand of royce gripping the other
stick
  why you- bill shrieked but the
words were swept instantly away from the
diving plane
   royce shoved his stick sidewise to make
the plane bank and fling his relaxed head
and shoulders back into the cockpit as
soon as he had collapsed-artistically-out
of sight of the girl he turned grinned ami-
ably upward at his angry friend and relin-
quished control of the plane
   bill mcclellan splitting his attention
three ways among reassuring nods to the
girl animated remarks to royce and
steady control of the flamingo spiraled
gently downward royce carefully keep-
ing under cover lit a cigarette took a few
puffs and then pulled a pencil and an en-
velope from the pocket of his coat
    if you tell her its faked ill say youre
concealing your heroism he scrawled
 im pro-girl you tarantula
  he held this composition up to bill and
then restored it to his pocket bill sur-
veyed it fiercely and then turned his whole
attention to the plane now coming in over
the hangars he set the flamingos stout
wheels and tailskid on the greensward with
unnecessary emphasis while royce prompt-
ly resumed unconsciousness- the pilot was
still in a large inanimate heap when the
plane trundled to the hangar and stopped
    	a
   oh bill millicent said in the sudden
stillness the tone in which she said it
caused an irrepressible quiver to run
through the stubbornly unconscious frame
of royce grainger bill with much un-
necessary violence and some assistance
from the mystified flip hauled the pilot
out of the rear cockpit and let him trickle
to the ground royce decided that it was
time to come to
   where am i he murmured opening
one eye cautiously
  the poor man said millicent bend-
ing over him with so much tenderness that
royce felt well rewarded for his duplicity
 i-i must have fainted royce said
sitting up feebly and looking around flip
devans after a single glance made a queer
sound and disappeared into the darker re-
cesses of the hangar
   you did said bill mcclellan sullenly
 in the air asked royce with horror
in his voice
   in the air bill corroborated savagely
 bicl you saved my life-you must have
saved my life i mean royce declared
solemnly and weakly holding out his hand
 and he saved yours too he added as
if by afterthought turning to the girl
 hes the bravest man i ever met and the
most modest
   i think so too the girl said softly
  a bad fit of coughing came to royce at
that moment and feebly excusing himself
he staggered away but as he tottered he
muttered  now lets see you break away
bill you philanderer youre as good as
married now
  after watching bill and the girl drive
away flip devans scratched his right ear
for ten minutes with negligible results
  that night at i am in the little cottage
near the field where royce spent his sleep-
ing hours the telephone jangled with that
imperative jangle reserved for the small
hours royce sleepily endeavoring to re-
call some of the new words bill mcclellan
had shouted at him in the rear cockpit an-
swered it
   royce old scout i want to thank
you the man on the other end of the wire
exclaimed excitedly
   what for royce asked suspicioustyj

argosy-allstory weekly
when he had identified the voice as that of
bill himself
   for fainting even if you did frighten
her you did it shes accepted me bill
raved happily  just a few hours ago i
had to tell you right away
   what are you thanking me for royce
said crossly  werent you trying to climb
out of it
   climb out of it with millicent no
you iguana shes the reason why i want-
ed to get rid of the other one
   what other one asked royce un-
gluing an eye in somnolent semi-surprise
   the one that was on my trail that
one eloped with a submarine lieutenant on
tuesday she thought he was so heroic
the vamp i tried to tell you this was the
other girl but you wouldnt give me a
chance
 what other girl royce persisted
 sleepily
 the girl bill answered promptly
 then - but - what - why-bill you
call me up again some time or send me a
diagram i congratulate you anyhow and
commiserate the lady d-night
royce stood for a moment looking at the
silenced telephone as his faculties dimly
wrestled with the news then he chuckled
venting a noise like a rusty saw biting into
a box
  it was altruism all right he assured
 the telephone sighed an inexplicable sigh
 after the manner of bachelors on such oc-
 casions and went back to bed
  to-day
 j have such flowers of truth for you
   dear one as you like best
 and memorys patient fingers keep
   for me-the withered-rest
 i sort my words as vendors do
   their blossoms bright and dull
 that when you come within my room
  life shall be colorful
 for you-gay speech my dreams of gold
  when skies have opened blue-
 but memory holds some faded hours
  i will not give to you
 you come-you go-i wear your kiss
  you smiled at loves demands
 oh memory why not throw away
  those dead things in your hands

the meeting
 endriks entered his cabin and
 faced fane wu
  well hendriks said  let us
 lay our cards on the table
 fang wu smiled
  ah of them captain hendriks that
 will hardly be necessary-for me i shall
 merely expose a few none of which shall
 be properly speaking a trump
  where have you got miss mactav-
 em
 fang wu smiled again shrugged and
 laughed a little
  ah you americans i might even say
 all you white men you are so naive so
 patently ingenuous
 he grinned fatuously  she is very near
 you your children i believe play a game
 in which one of them is blindfolded and
 gropes about for the object of his search
 as the object is approached the others cry
 you are getting warm captain you are
warm very warm but in this game it is not
you the searcher who will be blindfolded
but miss mactavern the searched if -
his voice snapped to a thin metallic twang
- if you raise one finger against me if
you make one step in any direction other
than that which i shall dictate to you that
girl will be blinded for life
   hendriks stood irresolute
  fang wu continued
   think of my power what i have done
aboard your ship from the time when that
girl managed to evade my vigilance for a
single moment and managed to get that
note on deck working with absolute
smoothness and precision i and my agents
have disorganized your ship demoralized
thit atory began in thm argosy-austory weekly for october

your crew sent out such wireless messages
as we desired and i am sure you will agree
with me effectively arranged matters so
that you were unable to send out any in
turn it was such a pity to break up the
set it was such a pretty set but then
there is after all a certain subtle pleasure
sensation-atavistic if you wish-in de-
stroying beautiful things dont you think
   hendriks glared on in silence fang wu
 smiled
    you are so typical of your race cap-
 tain you refuse to be led away from the
 point at issue led away into pleasant by-
 paths of conjecture i have a passion for
 bypaths they always appeal to me as be-
 ing so pertinent let me see where were
 we signals ah yes-that green flare
 lovely color and that black flag with the
 yellow crosses both were in the nature of
 successful feathers for our bonnet
    and such a simple matter to remove the
 fuses so that we might work in darkness
 and to later cut the circuits you will par-
 don my splitting the infinitive it is one of
 my little vices and it would have been
 such a simple matter to have prevented us
 -if as i have said your crew were not de-
 moralized
    as to that trifling dash of poison in the
 food i really have mr rutledge to thank
 for the prevention of what might have
 turned out to be a rather fatal blow to us
 i refer to the fact that some of that food
 was offered to miss mactavern i was
 really in rather of a quiver as to the out-
 come i shall arrange a suitable offering
 of joss for the soul of that cat when i shall
 arrive in china i have made a note of it
 the food was of course intended for the
 rest of you it seemed expedient that-well
 that you should not be so many especially
 as miss mactavern was then under your
 guardianship now that the delight of her
 society has again been bestowed upon us
 the poison is a non-essential there are-
 other things
    finally my dear captain hendriks it
 pleases me to inform you that we are en-
 trenched in various strategic points about
 the boat from which your men will be shot
 down like rats if they attempt to dislodge
 us and from which we shall issue forth
when i so desire to do the things i shall
desire to do
  you are the master of this vessel
fang wu laughed softly derisively  you
have no more authority on board here than
one of your wipers in the engine room
he drew himself up to his full height  i
am master here
  the taunt was too much for human en-
durance certainly too much for a ships
masters endurance and that on his own
ship hendriks leaped for him fang wu
drew in his breath with a sharp hiss and
dexterously stepped to one side
   from the adjoining cabin came a scream
of terror a scream that stopped hendriks
dead in his tracks just as he gathered him-
self for another spring
    you see fang wu smiled pleasantly
    i see
   hendriks sank dejectedly into a chair
 well what is it you want me to do
   that is better fang wu also sat
down  now we shall be able to talk
harris burst dramatically in through the
doorway hero-being bent an alluring vi-
sion following instantly upon the scream
had flashed upon him a vision in which
he gallantly bore the heiress to many many
millions off to safety and to undying glory
for himself-the whole affair being pleas-
antly gilded by a haunting tinkle of future
wedding bells
   just how or where he was going to bear
her failed to take definite shape in his vi-
sion no matter duty had called shrieked
in fact and duty would not find him lack-
ing having brought his cyclonic entrance
to a teetering stop he looked for the heir-
ess nary an heiress could those devil-
ish celestials guzzling nectar up olympus-
way be mocking him again
  i heard a scream
   harris had just caught himself in time
from shouting  wheres the heiress
   stop mr harris dont come in
return to your post please there has
been no sign yet from the other vessel
ye gods his post the other vessel be
damned as for himself might he harris
be stricken irrevocably pink
   no sir none as yet mr macdonald
is watching
dirty weather

 he will let me know
  yes sir immediately
  thank you that will be all mr
 harris
 harris went bilked again he was
 never so near becoming an agnostic as he
 was at that moment
  what is this sign you speak about
 captain
 fang wu flickered his eyes at hendriks
  sign no sign-just any sign of mr
 rutledges return
  do not expect that sign captain hen-
 driks mr rudedge will not return
  you dont know rutledge
  but i know-other things
  then that boat is the one you sent
 that message to i
  perhaps
  you would have me believe so anyway
 its to your advantage to have me believe
 so
  my dear captain if there were a friend-
 ly armada around you still what could you
 do he pointed significantly toward the
 adjacent cabin hendriks sat silent  you
 white men are so shall we say heroic ro-
 mantically heroic when it is a question of
 a woman you go to such never-ending
 lengths of sacrifice a dangerous trait in
 any race a trait detrimental to the per-
 fect advancement of any race
  a trait i thank god for im proud of
 -a trait any man of us would die for sir 
  that is one direction in which i can-
 not possibly prevent you from following
 your inclinations kindly call your other
 two officers in here with you
 they shall not leave their posts
  do as i say or- fang wu shrugged
  blindness dear captain is only one of the
 lesser terrors i have up my sleeve
 hendriks crossed to the door and called
 below
  mr harris come up here please
 a much resigned and gloomy harris
 came into the cabin macdonald burst in
 -n his heels
 hes given the sign sir macdonald
 shouted  they arent armed were to
 resist at all costs 
 fang wu stood beside an open porthole
 smiling at them he took the white hand-
 kerchief from the breast pocket of his coat
 and fluttered it three times outside the
 port
    i	wouldnt advise moving gentlemen
hang a u said quietly  not so much as
an inch look behind you

the great adventure
sparks after rutledge had mounted
to the bridge of the yung swei and
the three chinamen had left him
alone to his own devices took a careful
and minute survey of his surroundings-
very much a la ernest montague de beau-
prix in  for his countrys honor his
royal blue funk of the night before had
completely departed with daylight leaving
him cool calm and collected which was
the perpetual state of the aforementioned
ernest m de b
  to get to the wireless shack technically
dubbed his objective he would have to
walk aft through one of the passageways
amidships and would then undoubtedly
find a ladder leading up to the deck on
which the shack was situated or he could
gain that deck by mounting to the main
deck standing on its railing and hoisting
himself up onto the deck above-provid-
ing no one were looking
  this latter alternative would further give
him the advantage an advantage heavily
underlined by ernest of surprise the wire-
less operator of the yung swei being the
proposed recipient of the surprise for if the
operator happened to be in the shack he
would not be looking for anyone to ap-
proach it from the rear any other method
of procedure would be treason to ernest
so he decided to take the chance the chance
of not being seen
  he adopted a highly degage air and pro-
ceeded to stroll carelessly about the well
deck as no pry mg eyes seemed to be
peering out at him from any corner he
took his degagt air by the hand and led it
gently up the ladder to the main deck
where he promptly dropped it like a hot
coal and scrambled nimbly via the railing
onto the deck above

argosy-allstory weekly
   for the rolling hills of fair lorraine a
background for the grim chateau that
towered et cetera he substituted as his
terrain the flat deck of the yung swei and
the iron ventilators fastened onto it all
was serene he loped on all fours aft to
the shack ernest would not have been
flattered he edged toward a porthole in
it and permitted one eye to peer within
the stack of the yung swei concealed him
from any observing eyes forward
  he ruthlessly discarded ernest for the
nonce and in a most professional manner
sized up the arrangement of the wireless set
the transmitter was an american marconi
	k w the tuner a simple one of the 
type so far at least his path was strewn
with roses
  it was a relief to him not to find some
unusual chinese mechanism that he would
have to puzzle out furthermore the
storage batteries were in the shack itself
and the fact that there was no emergency
spark induction coil clearly indicated that
the main set itself could be and probably
was accustomed to being operated from
the storage batteries direct such being the
case they could not cut off his power
  he resurrected ernest and they examined
the operator himself he was a small ema-
ciated chinaman the phones on his ears
sitting by the operating desk listening in
   sparks smiled before drawing his sword
mentally and stalking the villain he con-
sidered the possibilities for defending the
shack against attack there were two
doors one opened into the bunk room
and the other one in the after end of the
shack opened on deck
  there were four ports they were of
the usual thick glass and would resist
breaking for a moment a moment that
might-must-last long enough to get off
that tremendous message on which every-
thing the very existence of the whole world
as it seemed to him depended after that
it didnt matter nothing mattered he
had a revolver and a pocketful of cartridges
the bulkheads of the shack were of steel
he could hold it against the whole crew-
he and ernest
  he went around the shack in his very
best stalking manner and paused in the
open doorway it was over in an instant
before the operator of the yung swei could
strangle out a single startled yelp the head-
piece and phones had been snatched by
invisible hands from his head and depos-
ited on the desk an arm had encircled his
throat and was doing its best to put a
permanent wave in his windpipe
  he then found himself being uncere-
moniously dragged into the bunk room
where a wild-eyed young white maniac
menaced him with a purposeful looking re-
volver and securely bound him hand and
foot with rubber covered wire
  the maniac next gagged him with one
of his own bath towels and slung him face
downward on his own bunk all to the tune
of various hissed fragmentary sentences
such as  aha gr-r-r zee surprise marse-
wer zee sacre-take zat and that you
yellow puttied- and so forth
  this trifle completed sparks closed and
bolted all the ports in the bunk room the
only door leading from it was the one into
the operating room he pursued the same
tactics in there bolting all the ports and
locking the door leading onto the deck as
a final precaution he locked the connecting
door between the two rooms
  the stage was set
  he put the headpiece on and tested the
sensitivity of the crystal detector with the
buzzer except for a few atmospherics
everything was quiet he threw the switch
on the charging panel to  discharge  and
closing the switches to the  d c and
 a c circuits pressed the button that
operated the automatic starter when the
generator had attained normal speed he
threw the  changeover  switch into the
sending position and pressed the transmit-
ting key
  the aerial ammeter registered a radia-
tion of over fourteen amperes enough-it
still being early morning scarcely past
daybreak-to radiate a distance of about a
thousand miles finally he placed the
loaded revolver on the desk near the key
and started to send
  there were only two things they could
do now to stop him one was to shoot him
dead the other was to cut the aerial leads
or lower the aerial to the deck he doubted
dirty weather

whether any one would risk doing that
while he continued to send the risk of
death from the shock of the radiated volt-
age was too great also there was the psy-
chological fear of the layman for electricity
  he decided however not to stop just to
keep on sending until the first of the two
possibilities should come to pass ah er-

flight
avery potent sense of menace in the
voice of fang wu as he said  look
behind you checked the three of
them from leaping upon him in an aveng-
ing mass and snuffing him out on the spot
  hendriks harris and macdonald turned
about each one of them was prepared
for a bad shock had steeled himself for
a new and disastrous danger-some trap
there was absolutely nothing there
  the blank bulkhead stared them harm-
lessy in the face they heard a scurry the
click of a latch the turning of a key in the
door and fang wu was gone they were
securely locked up in the captains quarters
   a mocking voice from the other side of
the closed door said to them quite dis-
tinctly as you break down the door
gentlemen or attempt any exit in an un-
dignified fashion from the portholes you
will be shot down like dogs i preferred
having it done that way than while i was
personally in the cabin with you it is so
much safer-for me
  it is also so very much more conven-
ient to have all the officers imprisoned to-
gether than at the head of their men where
they belong oh and captain hendriks
i am sure that miss mactavern will be
highly amused when she learns that you
mistook the voice of one of your former
mess boys as he screamed so excellently
through one of the open ports in your
sleeping quarters for her own rather charm-
ing certainly more charming voice
    i bid you good-by gentlemen perhaps
we hall meet again the infinite is so in-
definite i hope you will be well accli-
mated by the time when i shall arrive to
join you there
   the voice trailed off into silence
    god strike you pink said macdonald
to harris who was staring at the closed
door with what appeared to be a perma-
nently opened mouth
   mess boy mess boy harris mum-
bled feebly
  he became an apostate on the spot-a
veritable hierophant of heresiarchs to say
the very least
  then they attacked the door for har-
ris it was a symbollic rampage of icono-
clasm it was a stout door a good oaken
door and their efforts made little impression
upon it they flung themselves repeatedly
against it it gave a little each time-but
not enough
  no one mentioned the advisableness of
exiting via one of the ports there was
something rather magnificent about burst-
ing through a door in full war cry and a
brandishing of weapons even if one were
shot down for it but to be popped at
when sliding out of a porthole in the man-
ner with which it was necessary to slide out
of a porthole no even heroism has its
limits
  fang wu rapidly descended to the deck
there was no one about the men clutch-
ing their fire axes and slice bars were all
patiently huddled together in the starboard
alleyway harris had left them there with
rigid instructions not to budge a nose until
he returned to them he had been so
definite as to what not to do and so vague
as to what would happen to them if they
did it that he had rooted the lot of them
to the spot
  fang wu gained the boat deck aft he
made a sign to a yellow face that peered up
at him from number three hatch
  a moment or two later miss mactavern
and the seven remaining members of the
stewards department stood on the boat
deck beside him placing miss mactavern
in one of the lifeboats they lowered it
with much expedition and efficiency over
the side and slid down the tackles into it
as it struck the water they cast off
shipped the oars and were well away and
heading for the yung swei as hendriks
harris and macdonald burst out on deck
  fang wu waved politely at them
  macdonald grabbed the captains rifle
with which he had made such a brilliant
shot at that bird of prey in his aerie in the
crows nest and leveled it at fang wu
  fang wu grew rigid petrified this
dirty weather

move on the part of that white devil wasnt
in the game at all for a shocking second
he saw the writing on the wall it read in
chinese  finis at that instant mac-
donald pulled the trigger
  there was no report no sound mac-
donald had forgotten to reload the rifle
  fang wu mentally and fervently prom-
ised an oblation of one thumping tou of
joss sticks to his favorite deity and made
a grab for miss mactavern
  by the time macdonald had the rifle
reloaded his target was little more than a
head grinning amicably at him from be-
hind a highly indignant and uselessly wrig-
gling heiress he flung the rifle down onto
the deck
  fang wu murmured soothingly to his
squirming bundle  these delightful white
men so crass so savage in their lives and
yet so exquisitely idealistic in this one re-
spect-their attitude toward women
  not that he would have it otherwise for
worlds for any number of worlds it was
so convenient however it might be just
as well to give them something to think
about-a little antepast of the great deal
that was to come
  he fluttered his handkerchief twice to
captain tsin who was standing on the
bridge deck of the yung swei watching
him the disappearing guns of the yung
swei rose slowly above her bulwarks
crashed a single round and disappeared
from view
  both from an artistic and a dramatic
point of view it was quite a success-a
blinding success the effect was tremen-
dous fang wu from his box seat in the
stem of the lifeboat delightedly took in
the immediate confusion that prevailed
upon the china queen
  one shell had struck just forward of her
stack a mass of splinters fume smoke-
jetted for a flash with flame-rose high into
the air trembled into a ball and floated
away on the breeze the other three shells
had passed harmlessly over her superstruc-
ture and after a ricochet had plunged into
the sea
  harriss cohorts had decided en masse
to budge their respective noses and had
come tumbling out on deck in fine confu-
sion and with a brave brandishing of fire
axes and slice bars
  by the time the smoke and fumes from
the discharge of the four guns had cleared
away from the deck of the yung swei
fang wu and miss mactavern were
aboard her and had gained the bridge deck
captain tsin hurried toward them as
they met a highly excited sailor blood
streaming from a gun wound in his cheek
dashed up to them and omitting all cere-
monials announced in chinese that a white
devil with fire shooting from his nose eyes
and mouth had barricaded himself in the
wireless room and was sending out mes-
sages at the rate of one a minute-having
first indubitably eaten alive the operator of
the yung swei who was nowhere to be
found
  fang wu was the first to be struck with
the full importance of this lurid and highly
colored announcement he stripped it of
its oriental embellishments and came to
the disturbing conclusion that that young
squirt from the china queen had managed
to put a crimp in his bonnet was technic-
ally speaking foiling him-not alone him
but a good slice of the population of china
as well
   lower the aeriel to the deck
  the sailor having again witnessed the
miracle of a calorific mouth clattered off
fang wu dropping the role of pyrotech-
nist turned to tsin
   that is the most serious check we have
encountered yet flight immediate flight
at full speed is our only hope we can
waste no time amusing ourselves with the
china queen sink her and order full
speed ahead
   the men in the boats they are al-
ready lowering them over the side
   sink her the boats are of no conse-
quence
  tsin gave a rapid order to the gun crews
below three furious rounds crashed the
china queen vaguely seen through the
drifts and eddies of the smoke shuddered
her stack crashed forward she began to
settle swiftly at her bow
  tsin rang the yung swei full speed
ahead very distinctly and very pleas-
antly through the choking haze fang wu

argosy-allstory weekly
spoke to tsin-as though he were relating
the most amusing anecdote in the world
 one neednt worry about the men in
the lifeboats captain i personally poisoned
the water in them myself i doubt whether
any message sent out from here could bring
aid within ten hours or so surely long
enough for them to have grown pleasantly
thirsty
  he paused bit his under lip the dis-
turbing thought had come to him that he
had forgotten to remove the signal rockets
from the lifeboats it was a small matter
a detail still- then quite incomprehen-
sibly to tsin he added  it is a most un-
fortunate fact that the only things in life
of true importance are the stupendous cli-
maxes that are sometimes achieved by
trifles
  when the smoke had cleared from the
final round the yung swei was forging full
speed ahead great sheets of spray surged
and broke athwart her bow
  all eyes were riveted on the china
queen whose stem was high in the air her
forward end entirely submerged clearly set-
tling for her final plunge slowly then
with increasing rapidity she slipped be-
neath the waves a muffled concussion fol-
lowed by a surface disturbance indicated
that her boilers had blown up
  at some distance away from her three
white specks bobbed upon the water they
were her lifeboats with their cargo of hu-
man lives who would soon be thirsty and
would want to drink-
  fang wu hugged the image to himself
he would give much cash many taels to
view the ravages of that thirst quenching
he debated pleasurably the comparative
values between the first expressions of hor-
ror that would come into the faces of the
drinkers when they realized that the water
had been poisoned and the later expres-
sions of despair tragedy pain--
    we will now he said to tsin  attend
to our guests-miss mactavern the inter-
esting mr rutledge and that gentleman
in the wireless room
  but the guests were not there to be at-
tended to miss mactavern had been left
standing near the head of the ladder lead-
ing down to the well deck the sailor who
had been detailed to guard her was now
lying flat on his back with an eye already
puffing up and pigmented with arioib
beautiful if un-oriental shades of color
rutledge too was a minus quantity the
mess boy who had comprised his body-
guard was standing staring stupidly ai his
own empty hands out of which the revolver
had been snatched
  fang wu shrugged
  i am afraid they have been learning a
few little tricks from me well let us look
for them it will be a pleasing divmise-
ment to while away the monotonous mo-
ments on board come captainl

dlrixg the confusion following the
arrival of fang wu the firing of the
yung sweis battery with its attend-
ant veil of smoke rutledge had not been
diddling his thumbs in spite of the tragic
qualities of the situation he was filled with
an irrepressible sense of happiness at hav-
ing his ginger-headed piece in sight again
  -as he would probably be killed anyway
what more glorious death could there be
than to offer his lifp in one supreme effort
for her sake ah diilce et decorum est pro
rujusa morif renouncing her dimmed
into a childish pastime in comparison with
that
  he pointedly winked and screwed his
face into an expression intended to denote
reassurance at her through a rift in the
smoke eddies from the first round he was
both relieved and shocked when h- delib-
erately winked back there was nothing
amateurish about that wink
  rutledge decided that the thing of im-
mediate importance was to get her away
at once to some place in which they could
barricade themselves and where he would
be able to defend her
  at first he had thought of grabbing her
and leaping over the side then towing her
if necessary back to the lifeboats of the
china queen he had discarded the plan
as unfeasible they would pursue them
possibly they would shoot at them at least
dirty weather

at him there would be nothing spectacu-
lar about his death
  after all he only had one death to spend
and he desired to spend it magnificently in
some glorious outburst of fighting of
smashings of uproarings glutted with
shrieks from his dying victims a scene
that would linger live in her eyes-when
he would be gone he remembered sparkss
statements about the impregnability of the
wireless shack if he could only get her
back there
  the second round had just been fired
adding its fog of smoke and fumes to that
of the first rutledge glanced cautiously
at the hazy figures of his captors fang
wu and tsin were peering engrossed at
the ravaging of the china queen miss
mactavern and her guard were almost
blotted out the vaguest of shapes that
gun-snitching almond-eyed mess boy
standing somewhere in the general locale of
his backbone was the only serious block in
his path
  very discreetly he started to turn
around every muscle in him fully prepared
to assist his hands in grabbing that colt
thirty-eight and his foot in planting an
energetic kick in the pit of that interfering
young persons stomach it was no time
to bother about the niceties set forth by the
marquis of queensburv rutledge com-
pleted the turn looked at his guardian and
gasped well he might
  the mess boy had a finger plugged in
each ear and his eyelids screwed tight to-
gether the revolver was trembling sky-
ward at a rakish angle of about forty-five
degrees	x
  rutledge snatched his revolver and
shoving the mess boy head over heels back-
ward into the passage hastened to his god-
desss side
  the mess boy later recounting the epi-
sode to such sundry sympathizers whom he
could inveigle into listening to him claimed
that one of the gunners had deflected his
aim the scandalous part of an arc and that
the shell from the gun had singed the very
buttons from his jacket
  rutledge stalked the young husky whose
business it was to sit tight upon the cap-
nces of miss mactavern plainly and can-
didly from the rear there would be time
enough for heroics later he drew the line
however at hitting the man from behind
apart from the ethical issue at stake it
wouldnt have done any good so he
gripped him by the shoulder and spun him
about
  before the sailor had even begun to re-
cover from the wonderment of why he was
thus suddenly experiencing the sensations
of a top rutledge had planted a blow
squarely on his right eye for purposes of
embellishment and one on the point of the
jaw for purposes of inducing sound if un-
sweet slumber he mumbled something in
his celestial ones ear and clutching her by
the hand fled aft through the splendid ob-
scurity of the swirling smokes from the
third and last round
  a few moments later rutledge miss
mactavern and sparks were together in
the wireless shack the occupant the legal
occupant of the bunk room had been
ousted onto the deck
  a hasty and tense council of war en-
sued it resulted in two of the ports being
opened one forward and one aft and rut-
ledge and sparks taking up a position at
each with loaded revolvers firmly clutched
in their hands rutledge at the after end
could command the ladder leading to the
deck below and well to both sides sparks
from his position could cover the deck as
far forward as the stack
  they wondered at the complete silence
that had fallen after the firing of the third
round they heard nothing but the vibra-
tions of the yung swei as she quivered
beneath the racing impulse of her engines
and the hiss and surge of the water streak-
ing by they stood at their posts with
nerves braced for the struggle that was
bound to come
   believe you me peter its goin to be
some jamboree sparks threw over his
shoulder
  rutledge grunted this inactivity both-
ered him worried him then there was that
ginger-headed piece constantly in his mind
that wonderful young nuisance whom he
knew was sitting tensely on the edge of a
chair and gazing bodkin-eyed at the exact
center of the back of his head

argosy-allstory weekly
   what did you mean by getting wrapped
up in a coffin and come popping- he
stopped the outburst had been absolutely
unintentional
    i didnt mean to
  rutledge blushed a healthy deep brick
red
 excuse me i was thinking aloud
he refused to turn around and discover
whether that quickly suppressed sound he
had heard had been the checking of a sob
fa distinct and extremely musical giggle
    you have no idea mr rutledge miss
mactavern said evenly  the nice things
that man with the scar said about white
men while we were in the rowboat-
    lifeboat
    the lifeboat
   and i suppose youre being sarcastic
his language must have been frightful cer-
tainly not fit for a very young girl like you
to hear
  she sailed smoothly past the quite un-
veiled dig
    xot at all he said you were so ideal-
istic
  rutledge gave her one squeezed-up look
intended to be a perfect blend between
sneer mess and viciousness and returned to
a minute observing of his prospective field
of fire he heard that noise again that
noise that was something between a sob
and a giggle this timt the giggle part of
it was quite unmistakable he wheeled on
her sharply her face was perfectly ex-
pressionless although from the rapid lower-
ing of her eyes they had undoubtedly been
focused upon the back of his head
    if you think this is a joke-
    i dont indeed i dont mr rutledge
those eyes were full upon him now he
glared into them
    say sparks broke in  if you two
birds dont cut out this chinnin and you
pete settle down to brass tacks theres
goin to be trouble come out of them
there clouds pete and look a few cold
hard facts in the face
  -	what facts rutledge demanded
frigidly
    the fact that theres the cutest little
bunch of slip-foot wild cats you ever want
to see in your life outside of a zoo holdin
a parleyvoo somewheres on this here vagoa
as to the neatest way they can get us out o
 this here fortress n skin us alive
    is that a fact
  it say its a fact- spat his pis-
 tol cut the stillness of the cabin  and
 	say that there little pellet of lead what
 just took a walk from the mouth of this
 here gats another fact-a good cold hard
 fact
    get him
   he ducked
    it struck rutledge that his ginger-headed
 piece hadnt screamed he glanced covertly
 at her her face was a bit drawn not
 much color left in it but her eyes were
 bright-two disturbingly shining interest-
 ing things
    who was it sparks
    just a chink back of the suck now
 i guess from now on you and me play
 sister annes pete he turned obligingly
 to miss mactavern  shes the dame in
 a yam called  blue beard who looks for
 dust on a road from a castle-tower turret
 window
    oh yes miss mactavern firmly
 suppressed any further  noises  i think
 ive read the story
     its a kids -ara a guy what must have
 been nuts sent it aboard with the ships li-
 brary i never piped it was a kids layout
 until i comes across another yam in the
 same book dealin with fairies-some skirt
 labeled titania like a cunard liner and
 oh boy was i mad say you couldnt see
 that there book travelin into the drink for
 dust
    rutledge fired
 fact number three pete you get
 him
  only parted his hair rutledge
 growled  he stuck his head up over the
 tap of the ladder guess its best to wait
 kid until they show more beef to shoot at 
 they waited
 nothing happened-all through the rest
 of that endless interminable day there
 were long periods of silence long periods of
 rambling talk ram hies during which rut-
 ledge unwittingly opened up his heart he
 told his story it was similar to the stoty of
 every man who goes to sea in its openness
dirty weather

 and simplicity its small affairs each magni-
 fied to adventure to romance and under-
 neath it all as deep and broad and tragic as
 the sea itself a restless current of great
 loneliness the empty longing of the heart
 of a boy for a home and for the mother
 vearning in it a longing guarded behind
 thick walls of scoffing reserve and only ad-
 mitted at odd moments on some long still
 watch at night beneath the friendly sym-
 pathy of understanding stars-kind godly
 eyes that would not mock this one love that
 was sacred
  miss mactavern slept a little and later
insisted on relieving the other two watchers
in turn while they snatched some much-
needed rest the sun pursued its leisurely
passage across the heavens and sank in the
western sky the darkness greedily began
to blot out the light
after an unusually lengthy silence miss
mactavern suddenly stated  im thirsty
rutledge and sparks were thirsty too-
had been so for hours uncomfortable hours
of parching dryness
   i wonder if there isnt some water in
this place miss mactavern pursued the
subject hopefully
  rutledge shook his head he had al-
ready looked for water in the container
above the basin in the bunk room it was
quite empty he said nothing about the
bucketfuls of water that had been splashed
up on their deck by unseen hands from the
deck below deliberate wasteful bucketfuls
suggestive agents sent to augment and to
force to the breaking point the scorch in
their throats finally he answered her
   i guess thats what theyre sort of fig-
uring on doing mary its cheaper for
them that way
  both of them momentarily forgot their
thirst under the electrifying thought that he
had called her mary then his full mean-
ing struck her starvation or thirst would
ultimately drive them out from their shel-
ter and into the open where they would
either be shot down or captured she dis-
tinctly did not want rutledge to be either
shot down or captured she wanted to at-
tend to the capturing part of it herself
  for a long moment rutledge looked at
her he could hardly see her night was
falling so swiftly there was no sense in
renouncing her again-for the third time
what was the use he was going to die
 for her
   see here he said  mary were all
thinking about the same thing-no chuck
no water-mary suppose that message
sparks sent out was picked up it may
be days before they find us well-mary
-so far as i can see our only hope is to
keep alive for those days theres no
chance of their getting us while we stick
in here we could shoot them down one by
one sparks and i both have a pocketful
of bullets-mary its this way theres
sure no hope for sparks or me if they get
us but they wouldnt dare touch us so
long as they were safe themselves but
dont you see if some blessed gunboat
should happen to pick up that message
and should come alongside to capture the
pack of them why they i guess theyd just
kill you too-mary so-so youve got to
stay in here where its safe and one of us
two has got to stay alive to keep you alive
and one of us two has got to go outside and
get chuck to keep all of us alive-mary
see
  nothing but the lack of breath stopped
him it was an enormous an unheard of
speech for rutledge sparks later referred
to it as his  mary  speech
   i do see peter- oh im not worth
it-i-
   cut that you mary shut up
  yes peter
   as i say weve got to get chuck and
water itll be black as pitch in ten min-
utes i figure they wont expect us to break
out so soon certainly not to-night theyll
be expecting us to wait until were driven
to it say to-morrow night he paused a
minute  im going out
  sparks firmly but politely snorted
   theyd be watchin the door pete
theyd see you open it
   got to take that chance kid
   i got a better idea
   shoot
  im skinny and small
   you are
   well medium anyway theres that

argosy-allstory weekly
 side when shes dark enough i bet no
 oned see me slide out of there
    nothing doing sparks this is my
 job
     say see here pete this aint no al-
 fonse-gastong party we need chuck
 theres a fat chance of that hull of yours
 pullin any ghostly flits about this here
 ship night or no night while me with my
 slender figure thats a different yarn
     now listen and get me straight i may
 	come back here considerable quicker than
 what i went in which case there wont be
 no time for no fancy swan dives through
 no portholes so be on the lookout the
 quimy-vtvvy-get me and if you hear
 any mad sweet rush and a healthy pound-
 ing on that there door for the love of mike
 open her up
    a quarter of an hour later sparks slipped
 through the porthole in the starboard end
 of the bunk room the shade of ernest
 montague de beauprix went with him
   there were no means of gauging how
 long they waited it seemed hours
    hell be back soon now mary rut-
 ledge whispered
     yes peter
   she was standing very near to him in
 the darkness
     dont be afraid mary
     im glad you are here peter
   so am i-hist loves blooming
 dream received a sharp nip in the bud
  listen-hear that
   it sounded like the patter of running
 feet like a gasp some one pounded on
 the door
    rutledge jumped for the door and flung
 it open the beam from an electric torch
 flashed into his eyes blinding him a sharp
 blow from a stick sent the revolver clatter-
 ing from his hand
 he smashed the flashlight to the deck in
 turn and leaped backward for the spot
 where he had left his mary he found her
 grabbed her and bundled her with a shove
 into the bunk room then he wheeled to
 give battle in the dark the battle he had
 dreamed of visioned
 the wine of supreme sacrifice coursed in
 turn firing him thrilling him to superemo-
 tions to superstrengths he was an ani-
 mal-a splendid gorgeous animal-roar-
 ing defiance at a mess of jackals who
 were seething crushing in through the
 entrance to his lair his love might not be
 able to see him swinging on to death-for
 he admitted now he loved her loved her
 deeply truly loved her measurelessly with
 all the wonder of that magic intoxication
 singing passionately in his heart-the mem-
 ory of this ending might not linger live in
 her memory when he would be gone but
 the sound of it would linger would ring
 forever in her ears he promised himself
 that and then he set to work
    every man every inch of flesh opposing
  him would be his enemy there would be
  no necessity for picking and choosing so
  he waded in what matter the odds the
  greater the more targets there would be to
  hit in this darkness and the fewer the
  blank spaces
    it was an orgy a bacchanal of squnches
  thumpings smacking blows of squeals
  and grunts and mighty bellowings-a su-
  perb windmill run amuck with flaying arms
  that struck in piston crashes against a
  smother of milling crushing bundles chat-
  tering in high falsetto shrieks
    and some one switched on the lights
   rutledge magnificently alone a car-
  nage of mauled figures glaring at him his
  mary standing bravely in the doorway be-
  hind him stood looking into a pair of eyes
  that glittered derisively in the gently
  smiling and quite unblemished face of
  fang wu

 pursuit
streaking through the waters at a
nerve-jarring speed of thirty knots per
hour the u s s western state darted
like an avenging arrow toward the theoreti-
cal spot on the oceans broad expanse des-
ignated as thirty-nine forty-six north one
seventy sixteen east
  in the living room of the captains quar-
ters clinton mactavern gripped the arms
of the chair in which he was doing his best
to sit and stared across at captain mcgee
 both were elderly men-mcgee wiry
dirty weather

straight in carriage mactavern slightly
shorter and stouter in build both were
stamped with the unmistakable seal of
leaders of men
   how many more hours did you say
  -	ten at the most its been three hours
since we picked up their message
   the things that may have happened
during those three hours mactavern
muttered  the things that may be hap-
pening now
  	we will know shortly
  - if we ever know 
  mcgee nodded he admired mactav-
ern admired him as a man who had
achieved success it hurt him to see him
breaking under the strain he had held up
so splendidly during the past days he
tried to divert him with talk
   at any rate mcgee said  cairn was
right you were wise to turn the case over
to the secret service
   it is political in its nature as much as
tivfl
   quite so and cairn is the best man
theyve got
   he was the first one to suggest the only
logical way of solving the riddle-to turn
against them the very weapon they hoped
to get possession of
   your wealth and the power it would
give them
   and the power thank god it gave me
it took exactly five hundred thousand dol-
lars mcgee and a binding promise of ab-
solute safety and immunity to buy just one
of the men higher up to get the one illu-
minating ray of light on the mystery that
we have been able to obtain-the fact that
my daughter had in some manner been
smuggled aboard a boat on the west coast
even he the man we bought knew no
more there is no doubt about that but
it was something
   it gave us a definite start to work on
made it possible for me to arrange in wash-
ington for naval assistance for having this
vessel placed at my disposal best of all
it gave me the satisfaction of being able to
do something definite you-you have
never seen my little girl mcgee i-
   i understand mactavern quite under-
stand little tot of my own at home
    really
    yes indeed cunning little vixen-
  three hundred odd miles to westward
three lifeboats connected by lines drifted
aimlessly upon the gentle swells the
blank glare of the morning sun beat down
upon them
   it is perfectly possible that no one of the
occupants in any one of the three boats
could state exactly what had taken place
after that first deafening round and the
bursting of that shell just forward of the
stack everything had been a bedlam of
confusion a mad scramble pierced by
several clear-cut and steady-voiced orders
   these orders had been instantly if sub-
consciously carried out they had low-
ered the boats so much was certain and
had got away just before the three final
rounds from the yung swei had dealt their
death blow to the china queen
   they had been too nerve-tired to specu-
late to wonder at the yung swei sheering
off and leaving them without first sending
their boats and themselves to the bottom
too tired for anything but sleep and a
blind feeling of relief in the thought that
it was all over
   their responsibility was at an end all
that faced them was the possibility that
their stock of provisions and their water
supply might give out before they were
picked up the very futurity of that pos-
sibility robbed it of any immediate terrors
   for three solid hours they slept to a man
   hendriks was the first to wake up his
first glance was to westward there was
no trace of the yung swei his eye slowly
traveled the whole circle of the horizon it
was unbroken by sign or smoke of any ship
he observed the sky he yawned
   then he realized that he was thirsty
    yes sir mcgee continued  regular
little towhead
   my girls hair is red mactavern
broke in  brick red she calls it titan
flame color the young imp he chuckled
 shes a regular wildcat when she wants
to be i remember margaret-my wife
sir died four years ago the sweetest
woman that ever lived she used to say

argosy-allstory weekly
that mary had my disposition was like me
to a dot
    its the same way with ellen thats my
little girls name of course shes much
younger than yours-only six be seven
the third of next january by gad but
they do grow up not by inches when
theyre that age but by feet why shell
be in long dresses before i know it i
   yes they do grow up not only up but
into us each year each day they become
more firmly woven into us marys heart
is my heart mcgee and her suffering is
my suffering im going to tell you some-
thing mactavern leaned well forward in
his chair  there are moments when i
feel that margaret is watching over her
its the one thought superstition call it
what you like that keeps me from going in-
sane moments when i feel she is with both
of us has come back to us in some inex-
plicable way i believe mcgee that the
bond that binds a mother to her child is
strong enough and great enough to sur-
vive even death
   there was a cask of water right alongside
of hendriks he reached out and took the
cork from the bunghole he wondered
when the cask had been filled last the
water would be stale he tried to remem-
ber when the casks had been filled staring
meanwhile at the cork there was a whit-
ish streak on the cork and just below it
a ring of discoloration he rubbed his
finger across the streak a whitish powder
came off on his finger he touched it to
the top of his tongue and felt a sharp
burning sensation
   he spat
  what a fool he was to have forgotten
he tipped the cask over the edge of the
boat and let its contents run out into the
sea then careful not to wake the still
sleeping men he jettisoned all rations and
water from the boat drawing the other
two boats alongside by means of the con-
necting lines he did the same in them then
he resumed his post sitting haggard and
careworn his eyes carelessly roving back-
ward and forward around the horizons
rim
   ten hours later-ten torturous bitterly
long hours later-a smudge of smoke was
sighted to eastward followed shortly by
masts stack and bridge of a ship bearing
to pass them about three miles to north-
ward
  twenty minutes later three sheaves of
signal rockets shot skyward from the life-
boats even in the broad daylight they
were distinctly discernible
  hard astarbd called the navigating
officer on duty aboard the u s s western
state
  a quarter of an hour later hendriks was
seated with mactavern and captain mc-
gee in the latters room
  immediately after hendrikss arrival a
radio had been broadcasted giving a com-
plete and accurate description obtained
from him of the yung swei and asking for
any information as to her whereabouts at
twenty-minute intervals the same radio
was repeated
  below in one of the junior messes har-
ris and macdonald formed the nucleus of
a group of star-eyed youngsters who list-
ened fascinated to the impassioned tale
that was being embroidered by harris
  harris was completely utterly happy
he had found his spotlight at last mac-
donald also listened also was fascinated
but from different reason principally as-
tonishment he could scarcely credit his
ears had there ever such a yarn as this one
been spun in the history of man as this
one that was now being spun by harris
eloquently colorfully glowing with wordy
fires of silks and satins blood and jewels
and lovely faces at last surfeited with
glorious sketchings-sketchings through
which there had run a modest if emphatic
kit motif of everlasting  is -harris
called a truce upon bedazzlements
   and so you see fellows he concluded
 therell be no more sea for mine-no sir
its ho for a home in each one of the capi-
tals of the world-paris vienna brussels
new york buenos aires why that man
mactavern will scatter riches-salvage
he laughed exultantly drunkenly  whats
the pile of shekels you get for salvaging a
ship in comparison with the piles and piles
of shekels youll get for salvaging an
heiress
                          	a
dirty weather

  to macdonald the amazing part of the
whole thing was that several weeks later
it all came true-all of harriss extraor-
dinary ravings came truetin a splendid
shower of gold that mactavern freely lav-
ished upon all of them
  at nine oclock that night a message was
received from the american freighter wal-
ter goodman stating that a boat answer-
ing to the description called for had been
sighted just before dusk in approximately
latitude thirty-eight twelve north and lon-
gitude one-sixty-seven west
   well gentlemen -captain mcgee
smiled grimly upon mactavern and hen-
driks- the chase is on we will be up
with them before dawn
chapter xxv
the final card
one thought stood paramount in rut-
ledges mind as he stared into the
eyes of fang wu-they would know
the worst  what have you done with
sparks he asked
   you shall see both of you shall see
i might add that the same temporary fate
is waiting for both of you you will oblige
me i am sure -fang wu glanced mean-
ingly at the revolver with which he was
covering rutledge- by leaving these quar-
ters i wish to use our radio set or i should
not dream of inconveniencing you
  these two were his mice and he enjoyed
playing with them he led them forward
along the dark deck through dimly lighted
passageways where groups of men stared
menacingly at them eying them with
smoldering brutish eyes
  a few moments later they were alone
with sparks fang wu had shoved them
into a cabin-forward-closed the heavy
door which was its only means of exit and
had locked it from the outside rutledge
wondered at the reprieve he had ex-
pected to find sparks either in the throes
of torture or dead
   what happened to you sparks
there was more than a trace of  ill
say your slender figure proved a washout
in rutledges manner
     a
   they jumped me before id gone ten
feet waitin for me just forrd of the stack
didnt give me no time to cry out didnt
give me nuthin but a bent neck that guy
with the scarred mitt was wised up to the
whole frame-had a stool crouched down
to the port listenin to everything we said
must have crawled there after dark
courtesy prevented sparks from adding
 while you were chinnin with that there
mary jane however he did his best to
imply as much in one mean meaning look
the look registered
  the door was unlocked then opened
fang wu came in he was followed by
a boy carrying a tray on which was food
and a carafe of water the boy placed the
tray on a table then left the cabin
  fang wu began to play with his mice
   doubt anxiety the fear inspired by
anticipation all of us know its subtle its
delicately torturing values i can imagine
miss mactavern the horrors that your es-
timable father has been and must still be
experiencing i assure you -he smiled
at her- they are mere trifles mere petals
of plum blossoms fluttering on idle breezes
in comparison with -he laughed out-
right- what the dear gentleman is about
to endure
  fang wrus hand shot from behind his
back where he had been holding it since
he had come into the cabin and he leveled
a revolver at rutledge who had shown
signs of a blinding desire to devour him on
the spot
   yes fang wtu continued  than what
he is about to endure this little game of
chess we have been playing is drawing to
a close it will result in a stalemate that
will be most amusing to me i shall out-
line for you my final move my coup de
grace so that its delicious spice may agree-
ably savor your coming repast fang
wu waved his hand graciously in the direc-
tion of the dishes
   your father dear lady is at this mo-
ment speeding toward you at the rate i
should judge of approximately thirty knots
an hour aboard the united states de-
stroyer western state he paused an in-
stant to permit the emotion of relief to
surge fully into the faces of his three ad-

argosy -alls tory weekly
mirably performing mice  but-let u
consider the details of the situation-linger
for delightful moments over each nuance
   how are the chess men set upon the
board first your father he possesses
the knowledge of our approximate position
and the means to reach us when he does
so he further possesses the means to cap-
ture us to sink us if he so desires to sub-
mit us to trial to capital punishment to
what you will-if he so desires and i
against this formidable array a few
little guns a boat of indifferent speed a
few men and my dear you
    of lesser value but still of account i
 have mr rutledge and also mr sparks
 they are of little account in comparison
 with you whom i consider as my queen
 but then i have known a single pawn to
 have been the deciding factor in a game
 of chess you marvel at the manner
 in which i know these things these fact
 about the movements of your father the
 east is full of things that are strange my
 dear of things that are occult
  bosh snorted sparks flubdub
   the interruption shattered for fang
wu what had been a rather exquisite little
dramatic moment it disturbed him into
a frown which he ruffled upon sparks
    i beg your pardon
    i said bosh-bosh and flubdub
    and why -fang wu grew icily polite
- might i inquire do you remark  bosh 
and  flubdub  i regret that my knowledge
of your language is so halting that i am
unacquainted with the precise meaning of
the two-the two-er-gems
     say listen here bo stop try in to pull
 this snake charmin act on this little trio
 because were wise wise hombres sparks
 pointed an emphatic finger at fang wu
  the only occult thing about the business
 is how that there ham op of yours managed
 to revive enough after the d ts i handed
 him this momin to cop the dope about
 this dames old man after you got pete n
 her out of the wireless shack and he could
 listen in again
   fang wu having recovered from the first
 chilly shock to his art grinned-orientally
 what an astonishing little game-cock this
 disrupter of illusions seemed to be
   ah well fang wu sighed - if you
insist-yes youth youth what can be
more refreshing more romantically cnid
yes dear boy that is the gassy truth which
i had enveloped so beautifully within the
iridescence of my little bubble mr ah
low whom you so deliciously refer to as
my  ham op did iust succeed in inter-
cepting a flight of most interesting mes-
sages that were being tossed between the
western state and a freighter by name of
walter goodman it appears that the
walter goodman caught sight of us around
dusk and that she has betrayed our op-
proximate location to our pursuers per-
haps there are some other little bubbles
that you might care to prick
   there is-several
   i am at your serv ice fang wu bowed
elaborately it amused him to be com-
plaisant-to an extent
   aint it a fact tht the time when our
steward hong wing and them two mess
boys were found knocked out cold on the
deck of the pantry and he claimed that
theyd been handed the fadeout by some
prune who first switched the lights out on
them and yet them lights was on when
we found the three of them lying there
that hong wing pulled the stunt himself
so as to make us think the stewards de-
partment wasnt in on the little game
aint it a fact
   and aint it a fact that the time when
the saloon mess boy got into the old man s
cabin where i was sittin after decodin
that there message you sent and the lights
were put out that what he wanted was to
get that message and that the reason why
he didnt knife me was because he wanted
to find out where i had the message hid-
den and that sudden-like hong wing
moseying around outside learns that pete
and this here dame is headin our way and
so he pounded on the door to make the
mess boy open it up so as he could turn me
off before pete got there to help me aint
it a fact
    alas it is 
   and aint it a fact that your hangout
that time we made the search of the ship
for you was in one of the hawse pipes
aint it a fact
dirty weather

   it-aint fang wu chortled  let
me set you right my abode hangout if
you wish at that particular moment was
in the packing case you see there were
two compartments-one for the coffin and
one beneath it for me possibly you re-
member the rather unnecessarily large di-
mensions of the case and now shall we
proceed to the next bubble
  no sparks answered defensively i
never saw that case
   a fact for which i am very glad
fang wu stated emphatically and sin-
cerely  shall we now return to our little
game of chess we had i believe arrayed
the pieces and the next move was to be
mine what could i do i will tell you
to attempt flight would be impractical
quite hopeless the western state would
pursue us at twice our speed we would
be reported by every ship that crossed our
path eventually they would come up with
us therefore why struggle against the
inevitable
   i shall permit assist even the west-
ern state to find us when she comes
alongside of us i shall then make my move
this my dear miss mactavern is it
fang wu handed a typed message blank
to miss mactavern  it is a copy of the
message i shall send to your father aboard
the western state when she shall come
alongside us sometime before dawn you
will wonder why i do not radio it to him
now why i wait until they find us you
may think that to do so is a bit of bravado
foolhardiness perhaps i can explain
   it is a psychological truth that what
the eye sees for itself is more convincing
than the written word your father will
undoubtedly be standing at some vantage
point aboard the western state presum-
ably with field glasses with which he will
be searching our decks for you by that
time he will have just read this message
possibly the written word might not con-
vince him therefore you and i with
mr rutledge and mr sparks in the role
of minor characters perhaps shall stage a
little performance for your fathers benefit
upon our deck
   he shall be able to witness it quite
clearly through his glasses do you find it
difficult to believe me my dear miss mac-
tavern when i tell you that our little per-
formance will be quite quite convincing
fang wu pointed to the message blank in
miss mactaverns hand  i might add
that that message is my final card a pleas-
ant supper
  fang wu bowed slightly and left the
cabin they heard the key turn in the
lock miss mactavern read the message
her face paled
   may i see it rutledge asked
  she handed it to him sparks and he
read it together

   whether there is or not rutledge an-

swered  im going to bust her open and
see
   hold on a minute pete you got a
hairpin miss
  miss mactavern produced a hairpin
sparks took it and picked up a large sheet
of blotting paper from the desk he had
all the manners of a houdini about to
transform a peanut into a flock of pigeons
  rutledge and miss mactavern watched
him apathetically neither was in the mood
for a display of magic sparks slipped the
sheet of blotting paper through the crack at
the bottom of the door then worked the
hairpin about in the lock after a minute
of intense and concentrated jabbing he
gave a grunt of satisfaction and very care-
fully drew the blotting paper back through
the crack the key to the door lay where
it had fallen upon it
   kid where in hell did you learn how
to do that
  sparks had the grace to blush
   i had a shore job once he added
trippingly  the seas more healthy well
now that weve got this here key what are
we goin to do about it
   open that door and get out
   sure-promenade the deck i suppose
until they lead us tenderlike by the mitt
back again nit say pete if you got
anything above your neck but your head
now is the time to use it
   you two come with me
  rutledge took the key and carefully
opened the door inch by inch it opened
as they knew directly upon a passage the
passage was dark they passed out into it
rutledge closed the door and locked it
again
   well take the key with us he whis-
pered  theyll look around for it first
thinking some other one of them has it it
may give us just the extra time we need
   say time for what sparks hissed
   shut up kid-come
  they stole along the passage it ended
in an open doorway leading out onto the
forward deck great gusts of cool wind
swept into it
  outside it was still dark they moved
along on all fours until they had reached
the forepeak just forward of the anchor
windlass the dim form of a sailor on look-
out could be seen
   rutledge went forward alone he crept
upon the sailor he waited until the sailor
came abreast the windlass in his patrolling
with a quick lunge rutledge grappled him
about the knees and hurled him sidewise
before he could cry out the sailors fore-
head came up against the niggerhead of
the windlass with a sharp crack then he
lay very limp upon the deck rutledge
lowered him over the side and returned to
the two who were waiting
    sparks he whispered  you remem-
ber saying to harris when he searched the
china queen that if you were the fugitive
youd hide by riding one of the flukes of the
anchor well thats what were going to
do now are you game mary
    yes peter
    good stuff-now listen ill lower
sparks down first when hes set ill
lower you mary and hell get you settled
then he can help me down after
  somehow it was done the three of
them were seated on the broad flukes of the
starboard anchor holding on with tense
fingers holding on to keep from falling into
that seething spumous swirl that surged
one instant within a few inches of their
feet then shot downward with a suck and
gurgle as the bow of the yung swei
reached high into the air shot ever down-
ward until the fore foot showed and then
came rushing screaming hurtling upward
to tear them from their refuge and drag
them down beneath the sea
   far to eastward a slender streak of em-
 erald struggled to make way in the dark-
 ened sky for dawn
   clinton mactavern stood with captain
mcgee on the bridge of the western state
astern the sky was filling with the clear
cool tones of daybreak it was already
quite light it would shortly be sunrise
he swept the horizon with a pair of binocu-
lars
    smoke off the port bow sir came the
 voice of the lookout clear from above
  at last they had caught her they
would soon be alongside pumping good
solid lead into her
dirty weather

  they overhauled her with amazing speed
  -	i believe shes slowed down mcgee
stated  its her all right-answers the
description to a dot
  ten minutes later mcgee ordered half
speed then slow ahead they were along-
side the yung swei not more than three
hundred yards of water separated them
water that was now glittering in the sun
  at thar moment a seaman handed mac-
tavem the message from fang wu
  mcgee was speaking into the phone
 yes first one shot across her bows then
train the port batteries directly on her
make ready to lower the boats you can
fire when-
   stop-mcgee stop dont fire-dont
-i-here read that
  mcgee read the message
   well he said mactavern its up
to you
   we will do -the words came from
mactavern like so much bitter dust-
 exactly as he says hes got me mcgee
-because hes got my little girl
   three people floating astern the yung
siiei the voice from the lookout called
sharply  two men and a girl-making
signals to us sir
  mactavern grabbed the binoculars
   its mary shes saved-saved i tell
you put out a boat to-
  the words froze on his lips
  he clutched mcgees arm and pointed
to the stern of the yung swei
  a solitary figure stood there well braced
 against the rolling of the vessel he held a
 rifle and was sighting it with infinite care
 and precision upon the head of the girl
 floating now several hundred yards astern
  in a single leap mcgee reached the
bridge telephone
  eight streaks of fire a deafening stu-
pendous roaring crash the port batteries
of the western state had spoken
  great bellowing waves of smoke rolled
slowly away curving fantastically off to
southward across the waves-waves that
were unbroken save for the floating wreck-
age of the thing that had once been the
yung swei-save for the three heads still
bobbing safely now far astern and the
well-manned skiff from the western state
that was pulling for them
  for one frightened moment after the
western state had fired miss mactavern
had clung to rutledge then she had re-
sumed her easy floating at his side
   do you know something peter she
said
   what i wish you wouldnt make me
talk the water gets in my mouth
   you are saving my life
   what of it
   im glad you admit it this time and im
going to give you something for it
  he looked at her her face was within
six inches of his own ribbons of wet hair
streamed all over it

  she moved her face a precise six inches
and kissed him full upon the mouth

at sparks who scandalized had dived to
the privacy of another wave
  then he gave it back

the tragic death of mrs chester
railing wife of the famous physi-
cian had a most profound effect in
the city of wayne stepping suddenly
from behind a street car she was the victim
of a drunken automobile driver who dis-
regarded all traffic regulations witnesses
afterward testified that he was going at least
thirty miles an hour when the accident oc-
curred
  she died shortly after never regaining
consciousness attending physicians said
there was a fracture of the skull as well as
internal injuries
  the untimely death of his wife was a
terrible blow to the doctor he was deeply
in love with her and her passing away
seemed to utterly crush him dr railing
was a specialist in mental diseases and
during his twenty years practice had be-
come famous as soon as the news of his
wifes death was flashed over the wires
messages of condolence began to pour in
from all over the country several cable-
grams came from abroad many of these
messages however were never opened by
the grief-stricken physician
  as is generally the case following the
funeral of mrs railing the city began to
turn its attention to other matters in
due time the affair was but part of waynes
busy life
  dr railing however changed from the
day his wife was killed he immediately
lost interest in everything including his
practice which heretofore had occupied
practically every minute of his time ur-
gent calls were ignored and on several
occasions he refused to take note of cases
that would have paid handsome fees the
association of which he was president held
several meetings to discuss the matter
committees appointed to wait on him and
bring him out of the spell of morbidness

the test

acknowledged complete failure finally
after repeated efforts they gave up his
personal friends were likewise baffled and
agreed among themselves that mrs rai-
lingss death had completely wrecked her
husband
  three months later dr railings visited
the state penitentiary he had been there
on numerous occasions called to examine
inmates suspected of having mental disor-
ders he was intimately acquainted with
mcdermott the warden and was given a
hearty welcome by the latter
  why dr railing he exclaimed
 welcome wed about given up the hope
of having a visit from you again
  the doctor smiled faintly
   it has been a long time mac he re-
turned  however im here on a matter
of business id like to see a man named
lankford-amos lankford-who is to be
electrocuted friday
   certainly doctor returned the war-
den  just a moment
  he pressed a button on the desk and a
moment later instructed the guard that dr
railing be conducted to the death chamber
the doctor followed the guide down the
long corridor and shortly heard the bolt
shoot in the lock leaving him alone with
the doomed man
  the prisoner did not look up as dr
railing entered he sat on the narrow cot
staring sullenly at the blank wall
   im not here to do you any harm my
friend said dr railing walking over and
placing his hand on the others shoulder
 im here to do just the opposite
  the man raised his head and fixed his
gaze steadily on the doctors face
   yes repeated dr railing  i came
here to cheat the chair
  still lankford did not speak he con-
tinued to scrutinize the other man waiting
for him to continue he had heard so many
things since the supreme court had affirmed
the death sentence that the doctors words
seemed to have no effect whatever dr
railing sat down by the prisoner placing
his hands on lankfords shoulders and look-
ing him straight in the eyes he continued
 i know you are doomed to die friday
but as i said a moment ago i came here
for no other purpose than to cheat the
chair i am dr chester railing proba-
bly youve heard of me i am going to
speak frankly and make you a proposition
when im through you can decide are
you ready to listen
  lankford nodded
   im ready to listen to anything he
said dully  go ahead
  dr railing cleared his throat
   about three months ago my wife was
killed he began  she was run down by
an automobile at the intersection of fifth
street and twenty-third avenue she died
shortly after the accident occurred
   speaking truthfully and from the bot-
tom of my heart lankford i am an infidel
or rather i was until a few nights ago
i doubted the existence of a supreme being
i scoffed at such a thing as religion i did
not believe in a hereafter i laughed at all
forms of worship atheism was my doc-
trine i had no patience with any other
creed
   and it was this very fact that caused
my wife the only unhappiness of which i
knew i loved her with all my heart she
was life itself to me i would have cut
off my right arm for her i would have
been dipped in molten lead for her sake
but to profess belief in religious matters
was something i could not do not even for
her at least the way in which she want-
ed she tried to show me the way for
years but something in me wouldnt agree
i was honest enough to tell her the truth
i simply didnt believe the beast in me i
guess
  he laughed mirthlessly and continued
 now it is possible i was wrong im not
sure now i was at any rate i always
spoke what was in my heart i said that
i was an infidel until a few nights ago i
dont know what i am now the very night
i underwent this change i read in the eve-
ning paper that your last appeal had failed
and that you were to die friday then i
thought of an idea thats why i came to
see you
  mopping his forehead with a hand that
trembled slightly he continued  i was
visited by my wife the other night
  lankford looked at him suspiciously

argosy-allstory weekly
   visited by your wife he exclaimed
 what are you talking about are you
crazy
  dr railing shook his head
   indeed im not crazy i insist that i
was visited by my wife-spiritually i
mean
  he was silent a moment gazing steadily
at the floor suddenly he turned to the
prisoner
   she came to me while i was asleep
he continued his voice filled with emotion
 seemed to come in a sort of mist laid
her hands on my face and smiled i can
almost feel her touching me now he
rose and strode up and down the cell ner-
vously
  a moment later he seemed to steady him
self and resumed his seat  it was so nat-
ural that i can see it now he continued
 it seemed that i was looking at a great
black cloud which opened suddenly a
dazzling light came through and i saw her
standing there
   she came closer and closer and finally
touched me she spoke to me  i hope
youll believe after this dear was all she
said then i awoke you can never im-
agine how i felt i was shaking like a leaf
my very being seemed stirred to its foun-
dation i cant understand what has come
over me ordinarily i would have laughed
at such a thing as a mere dream taking hold
of me like that
   since that night it has preyed on my
mind constantly i have tried to forget
i cant the picture of my wife before me
seems to haunt me ive got to do some-
thing i must thats why i am here
   i cant understand dr railing said
lankford a trace of bitter sarcasm in his
tone  why you should select me to hear
all this what good can i do i have
something like four days to my credit
what do you mean by coming to me
what did you mean by saying you would
cheat the chair
   i said i was going to speak frankly
answered the doctor  and i have now
i want to make you the proposition he
rose and strode to the door peeping up and
down the hall making sure that no one
was near he returned to lankford  its
probably a brutal offer he said  how-
ever it should appeal to you as your last
chance is gone which would youprefer-
to go to the chair and be electrocuted by
the state or die as a result of heart fail-
ure
   lankford drew his breath with a rasping
sound and looked at dr railing quickly
good lord man he faltered what
do you mean
    ill explain briefly returned the doc-
tor  i dont know exactly how to put it
as i told you im a self-confessed infidel
now i want to try and prove that i am
wrong in the first place youll agree that
its better than to go through the tortures of
the chair
  lankford nodded
    then ill enable you to die like that
said dr railing  on condition that you
will come back and communicate with me
in some manner i dont care how you do
it-just so you are able to let me know
there is something after this life
   reaching into a pocket he produced a
small phial containing a greenish liquid
 this is a secret preparation he said
 one of a number ive discovered it pro-
duces two kinds of sleep first natural sleep
then the sleep that knows no awakening if
you accept my offer  give you this bottle
simply drink it in a few minutes youll
feel drowsy thats all there is to it the
poison will be completely absorbed by your
system so that the most rigid investigation
will reveal nothing
   a strained silence followed as the doctor
ceased lankford stared straight ahead
breathing heavily his hands were tightly
clinched showing white along the knuckles
he swallowed frequently dr railings
hand shook like palsy as he returned the
phial to his pocket his face was pale s
he looked at lankford for an answer
  good god quavered the latter sud-
denly bursting into a hysterical laugh which
caused a shiver to run over the doctor
    not so loud cautioned dr railing
 you might attract attention im sup-
posed to be here to examine you in the
interest of my profession nothing else
what is your answer
   give it to me whispered lankford
the
test

hoarsely a wild look in his eyes  ill do
anything that will keep me out of the
chair
   you promise that after death if pos-
sible in any way youll come back and
communicate with me asked dr railing
as he handed the phial over
  lankford nodded affirmatively
   ill admit that i am a coward said
the doctor  but i am anxious to bring
this thing to a test i want to know if ive
been wrong all these years possibly i have
done enough already to merit eternal pun-
ishment i dont know im still doubt-
ful by giving you this poison im really
doing a good deed the state will get its
pound of flesh it ought not to object
   why are you doing all this-why are
you so anxious to know if there is a here-
after asked lankford huskily
   if ive been wrong life wont be worth
a row of pins to me stated the doctor
calmly  my wife was everything to me
nothing else matters if i believed now
that she is somewhere waiting for me i
would take my own life to-day but i
am afraid i want to make sure thats
the wthole thing it is your duty to let me
know
   let me suggest that you wait a little
while-at least a day or so the doctor said
as he rose to go  it might look suspicious if
your death occurs too soon after my visit
  lankford did not answer he sat with
his face cupped in his hands staring at the
floor as the door closed behind the doctor
   perfectly rational said dr railing to
the warden as they shook hands  but in
a highly nervous state as a natural result
of what he has gone through
  the thursday afternoon paper contained
a vivid account of lankfords death in the
state penitentiary dr railing read the
item eagerly a shaded light which threw
its rays straight down and cast a dim glow
about the room illuminated the study
    death was due ran the account  to
heart failure according to the investigation
held this morning the prisoner was per-
fectly normal when seen about nine oclock
last night a careful examination of the
body showed that death was caused by
nothing other than natural causes lank-
ford was to be electrocuted friday morning
having been convicted of murder in the first
degree at the last term of court
   dr railing laid the paper aside si-
lence reigned save for the ticking of a small
clock on the mantel occasionally the cut-
out of an automobile sounded from the
street or the distant wail of a locomotive
was faintly audible
   suddenly a knock sounded at the door
dr railing started and sat upright
    come in he called
  the door opened slowly before him
stood amos lankford even in the dim
light dr railing recognized him instantly
he tried to cry out-the words stuck in his
throat
    lankford he gasped
   the form in the doorway seemed to nod
slightly
   the answer seemed to paralyze the doctor
for a moment then with a quick motion
he reached into his pocket and brought
forth a small phial similar to the one given
lankford the liquid in this container
however was of a brown color placing it
to his lips he swallowed quickly a mo-
ment later he slumped forward in the chair
    thats just how it happened he con-
cluded to the officer  when i opened the
door he looked at me like i was a ghost
he said something and then jerked the bot-
tle out of his pocket and drank what was
in it must have been terrible he was
dead when i got to him my name lank-
ford is my name-adrian lankford i un-
derstand dr railing visited my brother at
the penitentiary a couple of days before he
died

by john schoolcraft
  author of let the wedding wait etc
           chapter xiv
                the frame-up
    kitty came back from her ride earlier
    than usual she watered daisy at the
    trough washed the bits rubbed the
    mare down with a wisp of straw cleaned
    the stirrups and leather went through all
    the ritual which her father had taught her
    from start to finish and still did not go up
    to the house instead she tiptoed through
    the barn and stopped in the yard behind it
    listening intently for some sound from the
    tin house where she knew springtime was
    at work
       kitty reckoned that in her long life of
     twenty-one years she had seen almost every
     kind of male there was the kind that sat
     on porches and played ukeleles the kind
                  this story began in the argosy-allstory
                                                    
 that always wanted to hold hands the first
 day of meeting the serious ones who
 planned to be of service to the community-
 young lawyers mostly with their eyes on a
 village office-even lads from distant me-
 tropolises who came to spend a week in
 napoleon and upon seeing her decided to
 make it a month
   clerks farmers young merchants col-
 legians-they had all passed under her
 rather scornful eye and left her so un-
 touched that she had begun to fed that per-
 haps she was to go through life without ever
 feeling the delicious pain of love and in
 spite of the fact that she was perfectly cer-
 tain that there was something about spring-
 time which she had never before seen in a
 human being-something enthralling mys-
 terious she still did not know that the queer
 weekly for september 
the bird of passage

hammering of her heart which his presence
caused was due to any other reason than
that he was  different
  it was the first time in her life that she
had tried to make an occasion for seeing
any male human being she switched her
riding boots for a minute or two then
walked to the door of the tin shed and
lifted the sliver out of the hasp she con-
sidered it gravely for a moment then saw
what relation it bore to her fathers scheme
and giggled she swung open the door and
looked in but springtime was so intent on
his wrongs that he did not see her
  the sight of the big man glaring at the
harmless beans on the floor was funny to
kitty but at the same time something
caught her by the throat and choked her
laughter for she knew how strong was the
pull of the open road even if she had never
been on it her sharpened intuition told
her that this true traveler felt cribbed and
confined in a shed full of beans and as
she stepped over the threshold her sympathy
struggled for utterance but the best she
could do was
   is my old dad here
  springtime saw the open door first and
getting up took three long strides toward
it that brought him face to face with
kitty and he stared into her face suddenly
remembering the whole episode of the porch
which had gone so completely out of his
mind that he had forgotten all about kitty
and her queer poems he looked at her and
smiled for kitty in brown boots tan linen
riding habit and small brown hat was as
pleasant to look at as she had been in
the gold-colored sweater and sport skirt
  he looked quickly past her however to
the door and said  dont close the door
it has a latch on it that snaps shut your
dad forgot when he went out and locked
it it gives a guy a terrible feeling to be
locked up in a place like this
  kitty nodded and said  know it
must be terrible
  springtime ran his hands through his
hair and breathed deeply of the breeze that
swept in through the opened door
   was it locked asked kitty
  it sure was
  at the serious harassed expression on his
  face kitty felt nothing but sympathy-a
sympathy so deep and keen that instinctive-
ly she fought against it it was something
new and puzzling and the only thing to do
was to find a defense in the bantering boy-
ish manner with which she habitually met
her father
   how did you know she asked with the
same glint in her eye that springtime had
often seen in her fathers  did you try
to run away
   i did try the door a couple of times
it wouldnt open
   i wonder what he can be up to now
she said looking down at her boot tip  i
wonder what he has up his sleeve and at
her words springtime was instantly alert for
even hobo instinct in him sensed danger
   who he asked casually  your
father
   yes it seems queer that he should
lock you in here there was a piece of
wood through the staple of the door so
that it could not be opened except from the
outside that was queer
   it was a part of springtimes instinct to
run when danger threatened just as it is a
part of the ostrichs instinct to put his head
in the sand at sight of a copper run
when the word jail is even thought of run
unless you happen to be the kind of a stiff
who likes to spend the winter in a good
county jail he moved toward the door
without even saying good-by but kitty
laid her crop on his forearm and he stopped
dead and looked down at her she was
flushed but her eyes and lips and chin were
steady
    i couldnt possibly let you escape she
said  if dad wanted you locked in here
it certainly wouldnt be right for me to let
you out
  springtime glanced at the slender bam-
boo stick touching his arm looked out
through the bam to where freedom lay and
back into her face
    thats right isnt it said kitty  i
would have to scream or hit you with a brick
or something if you started to run wouldnt
i
  springtime feeling as though he were
hobbled by a thread as thin as cobweb and
as strong as steel shook his head helplessly

argosy-allstory weekly
   dont you like this work
   like it oh my good gosh
  kitty laughed-a warm sympathetic
laugh and applying a bit of pressure to
the riding crop moved her captive back
inch by inch until he was standing near his
old place by the peck measures something
was disturbing the wild goose on the lawn
for he was cackling and hissing and making
a row that would have driven tom osborne
to murder springtime waved his hand
helplessly and said  thats me he wants
to get out and so do i
    dont you think it said kitty with an-
other laugh in which there was no sym-
pathy  hell never leave as long as the
commeal holds out his wanting to be up
in the cold sky is all bluff
   what does your dad want to do with
me anyway asked springtime cautiously
 what is he up to why does he lock me
up in this tin shed with all these damed
beans he did something for me took me
to a bonesetter and had my back fixed and
gave me a place to sleep and hes been
white about a lot of other things and im
willing to do something for him to pay it
back-that is something within reason i
told him so and he brings me down here to
work on beans i cant stick it
   why not asked kitty
  well i cant thats all i have other
things to do
   what other things im asking because
i might be able to help
  well it doesnt matter blustered
springtime  i wont stay any longer than
i want to stay just as soon as i feel like
drifting i drift thats all if he had given
me something decent to do i would have
done it but im damed if i dont think all
bets are off when he puts me on a job like
this one when i get ready i go 
  there was something in kittys look that
made his words seem hollow even to himself
-as though there were an echo somewhere
that had the laugh on him and was mocking
him he was whistling to keep his courage
up something fatal and prophetic whis-
pered that there was trouble ahead and if it
had not been for that slim riding crop he
would have been out and away
    i wouldnt be too sure about that said
kitty quietly  dad has more tricks than
one up his sleeve something is in the air-
	dont know what it is but im guessing
that its about the bullet holes in the top
of the machine i know he had a long talk
with mr mccabe the chief asked him
a lot of questions and he answered some of
them youre probably under observation
  cold wave after cold wave went up
springtimes back and the sweat stood out
on his forehead his start toward the door
was a pure reflex action as unconscious
as would have been the winking of his eye
if kitty had thrust her riding crop at it
again she laid the bamboo across his arm
and he stopped dead
   you cant escape while i am here
she said firmly  after im gone you can
do anything you can but not now
  under observation gasped spring-
time  slim mccabe oh my lord
   yes said kitty as quietly as before
 dad told me all about the affair and
while you must believe that i dont for one
second think you had the slightest connec-
tion with it you will have to admit that
there would be some justice in-well in
suspecting you you saw my father go to
the bank and get some securities and you
rode with him to hanover and there you
looked into a window just in time to see him
putting thirty-eight hundred dollars in his
pocket when dad comes home it is dark
and you have had plenty of time between
seeing those notes and dark to spread the
glad news that tom osborne was driving
home loaded with bank notes
   dream on
   im not dreaming im telling you how
it would look there never was a squarer
man than my dad and there never was a
man who would be slower to suspect any-
body falsely or quicker to help any one
he thought was being falsely accused but
he is sure bad medicine on law-breakers
and hell move heaven and earth to get
that holdup man you can be sure hell
investigate everything and everybody
now ill tell you how the rest of it could
look he starts back home and there is
a barricade where never a barricade grew
before and that makes him slow down
there is the road agent and when dad
the bird of passage

pulls his own gun you lean across him
and shout  hes got a gun see warn-
ing the holdup man
  thats what he thinks breathed
springtime horror struck  i was telling
your dad that the crook had a gun 
  kitty nodded
   oh i dont believe for a second that
you were warning the holdup man im just
telling you how it would all sound to an
officer as i said you shout that and lean
across dad and turn out the lights in the
road so that he cant see your pal there in
the road and you knock the gun from his
hand the other man fires and the only
thing that saves dad is the fact that there
is a little downhill slope there so that when
he steps on the car hes doing fifty within a
hundred yards
  springtime rolled his eyes as though he
had been struck on the head with a black-
jack he sat down weakly and said  you
dont believe all that
   of course i dont
   but does he
 i dont know just how much he does
believe lied kitty  he hasnt told me
as the next figure in the drama sprang
into his vision springtime wet his lips and
got to his feet again
   does mccabe
   nobody knows i heard just a little
of what dad said and i know he didnt tell
him everything just as i have told it to
you
  springtime sat down again dazzled by
the perfection of the frame-up it unfolded
itself in flashes-one bursting rocket after
the other each one perfect in itself and
each one helping to make the whole scheme
perfect if the cleverest man in the world
had deliberately sat down to concoct a
scheme which was to incriminate him he
could not possibly have created as good a
one
  as the mental sky cleared after the last
rocket burst springtime got up and said
firmly  theres just one thing for me to
do and that is to beat it im sorry but
there has been more than one man sent up
the river on slighter evidence than that
kitty shook her head womanlike she
was enjoying the game and enjoying the
perfection of the net the more that while
it was so perfect it was harmless
   you arent guilty she said  i know
it and my dad knows it-away down in his
heart you couldnt be guilty-after the
way that little boy looked at you as though
you had pulled him out of a river or some-
thing if you stay right here everydiing
will come out all right but if you go mc-
cabe will broadcast the country with pic-
tures of you -a quotation from the talk of
her father- and youd be hunted if you
slipped away now dad would spend every
cent he has to get you back just as a mat-
ter of principle and mr mccabe is terribly
efficient a few years ago this town was
infested with tramps-you couldnt walk a
block without having some one stop you and
beg for money but he cured all that
   yes said springtime  ive heard
about him
  he turned away from her forlorn scared
yet perfectly aware that he was caught as
neatly as any fly in any web his future lay
in the palm of tom osbornes hand-he was
not especially angry with him for it because
it was only human nature in the world in
which he had lived for one man to take ad-
vantage of a hold he might have over an-
other
   i wouldnt worry said kitty gently
 i dont see why you should think that life
here would be so hard-for a while ive
known my dad now for twenty years man
and boy and ive never known him to do a
mean thing he either likes people a lot or
doesnt like them at all and unless i dont
know the signs he took a great fancy to
you right off the bat if he has it in his
head that you ought to stay here id stay
and believe me above all things i wouldnt
drift without saying something to him about
it that would be bad news for everybody
why do you have to go anyway
   i have to-thats all said springtime
   why
   i dont know-i do and theres noth-
ing else to it i get fed up with places-
and when i get fed up i simply have to
shift
  nonsense said kitty everybody
feels that way once in a while there isnt a
man in the world who doesnt want to leave

argosy-allstory weekly
his office or his farm or his job in a factory
what would happen if everybody moved
when things didnt go quite right and they
wanted a change i feel that way hundreds
of times-seems as though this little town
were choking the life out of me but its
ray job to stay here and help entertain my
dad and i do it it wouldnt be so hard
added kitty lowering her eyes  if youd
stay and help
  springtime looked hard at her and his
heart thumped
   would you like to have me stay
  kitty met his eyes bravely
   yes-i would we need another man
around the place i do the best i can to
help dad but try as i will i cant like prize
fights if he had you here to go with and
talk about right hooks hed be happy as a
clam
   but these said springtime indicating
the beans  ill go plumb crazy if i have to
do another bean
   theyre nothing answered kitty as
she flicked them about the floor with her
riding crop  all they take is patience
   dont say that again your dad told
me the same thing and if anybody else says
it to me ill slam him thats all you try
it and see if you think its so easy
  kitty sank to the floor scraped up several
double handfuls of loose beans peered into
the two measures to see which was to hold
the good and which the bad and spent a
few minutes getting each into the condition
which it was intended to have when every-
thing was shipshape about her she took up
a handful of the unculled ones and opening
her palm flat looked at them for a split sec-
ond then-snick the white fingers flew
and a pair of dark ones hopped into the
measure meant for their reception while the
handful of good ones went to their reward
fascinated springtime watched as the white
hands flew and the patter of beans sounded
like the fall of rain when she had worked
five minutes she spread out her hands and
said  see how easy it is
  dont stop he begged i havent
done any to-day and when your father
comes in hell give me one bad time just
go right along-you dont know how well
you look doing it
   all right said kitty  im glad to
help but you tell me about johnny im
eaten up with curiosity to know about him
where did he ever come from
   i wish i knew said springtime with
feeling  the little devil wont tell me
   he wont
   no hes cagey and he doesnt want to
go home he used to belong to an old acro-
bat named bender and bender got so sick
he knew he would never get well that
boys a gold mine-hed make a wonderful
pickpocket and he can sing and do a shuffle
and a thousand things bender wanted him
to go back home and grow up like a regular
boy and he asked me to take him i said
i would but i lost track of him and a
couple of stiffs got away with him i got
him back and now the little rascal wont
tell me where he lives so that i can take
him home i cant beat it out of him
  kittys fingers had stopped working
and she was staring out of wide eyes into
his face
   and that big brute she said slowly
 who was wrestling-and that wicked old
man who made him play two checker games
at once they were the ones that stole him
away from you and you were fighting to
get him back i knew it-that big animal
was fighting to kill and that was why i
saw about a minute of it and i couldnt
stand any more oh my goodness and
her unswerving eyes began to overflow
  the big tears trickled down her cheeks
and splashed on her outstretched palm
while springtime feeling spellbound could
only stand still and stammer  there
everythings all right
  after an indefinite period kitty wiped
her eyes on her sleeve as a boy might have
done and began to flick the beans out of her
palm
  oh my gosh dont do that said
springtime in a hollow voice
   what whispered kitty
   those damned things leave them
alone
   i dont mind she answered in a
stronger voice  and i think i ought to be
a shining example it really isnt hard
ill show you how to do it if you want
me to
the bird of passage

   springtim got down on the floor and
 as his proximity to kitty increased so the
 warmth and radiance of the billow that sur-
 rounded them increased the color had
 come back into her face now-a deep rosy
 flush that reminded him of johnny he
 watched her fingers fly and then filled his
 own hand and tried it but hopping beans
 instantly surrounded him and he threw up
 his hands
     there he said between laughter and
 rage  see how they act for me
   kitty did not laugh but demonstrated
 patiendy
    you take too many at a time if you
 fill your hand right up then when you open
 it some fall out and when you have so many
 you are bound to knock out some good
 ones
   springtime tried again and found that
 when he did as she advised he had much
 better luck the beans that skipped about
 him could be numbered by the dozens in-
 stead of by scores kitty watched him
 and gave him another pointer
    spread your hand out flat-as flat as
 you can
   springtime obeyed and found that it was
 still easier after a few minutes of careful
 concentration he found that he could actu-
 ally take a handful of unculled beans and
 - get them into their proper measures without
 losing one when he had got that far
 kitty dusted her hands and got up from the
 floor
    ouch she said  it does make your
 shoulders ache
    dont go pleaded springtime as he
 saw the deep golden haze beginning to pale
 just as it had on the porch  i wont do a
 lick more unless i have you here to cheer
 me on kitty shook her head and went
 to the door
    you have your start now you won t
 try to escape-if i leave the door un-
 locked
    i reckon not said springtime  im
 caught
    thats wise said kitty  you trust
 to dad and everything will be all right but
 if you try to double-cross him- she drew
 ber finger across her throat and made a
 sound suggestive of cutting throats
    about this johnny she said  we cer-
tainly ought not to let a lad like that stop
us how much do you know about where
he lives
   it s a white house with an iron dog in
the front yard and its in ohio state some-
where and the town has a ball team
thats all i know
   h-m that ought to be enough how
about letting the old sleuth take a whirl at
getting him home the old sleuth being
me
  fine said springtime fine fly
to it- give you ray blessing
   well there ought to be some way
said kitty  women are all natural bom
detectives wait until i put mother on this
case-shell get it out of him some way or
another 
   id hate to have her after me said
springtime who had never been able to get
over a cold chill whenever he was in mrs
osbornes presence  how much does she
know about-everything
   just enough said kitty with a confi-
dential nod  dad told her a wonderful
tale and she took to johnny as though he
had been the long lost dauphin you wait
-there will be important developments in
this case before long good-by
  she flourished the riding crop and disap-
peared and springtime sat for a long time
watching the doorway out of which she had
gone all of a sudden it seemed to be a
good doorway an excellent doorway a king
among portals he turned back to his beans
with a long sigh-nonplused by the multi-
tude of new things that had come into his
life after a time he gave it up-it was
becoming altogether too complicated he
sat down and began to pick over the beans
slowly painfully but with his palm
stretched out flat as kitty had advised
suddenly he heard a snicker and looked up
to see johnny standing in the doorway
who was doubled up with laughter
   look at him said johnny   look at
the hard guy oh boy
  springtime was after him like a flash and
caught him as he was going into the bam
he dragged him back into the shed and shut
the door johnny was almost helpless from
laughter and even though springtime shook

argosy-allstory weekly
him until his teeth clicked he could not keep
down the giggles that would come that
laughter brought home to springtime just
where he stood and the knowledge made
him almost crazy
    lay off that kid he hissed  or ill
skin you alive
johnny did stop and springtime let him
go-
 now he said grimly   give you
iust ten seconds to tell me where you live
ve got to leave this damn town and i cant
intil i know where to take you this time
you kick in as sure as god made apples 
johnny cast a furtive glance at the door
 one said springtime taking such a
handful of the boys coat that there was no
chance of his escape  two three four-
 cheese it said johnny earnestly
 springtime ive got some big news for
you
   five six seven-
   honest to god whispered johnny
looking around  some real big stuff you
dont want to pick beans do you well
youve got to if the old man says the word
now i can get you out of this if youll
just lay off the rough stuff theres one
thing the old man wants done and you can
do it for him i aint wise to everything
yet but im getting wise
   eight said springtime and stopped
he glared into the upturned face of the
boy
 this is straight he said  if i find
youve been fooling me i sure will tan you 
 straight as hell said johnny solemn-
ly  and there might be a little jack in
it for somebody if it was worked right
    spill it-what is it
    didnt i tell you i couldnt tell just
now-to-morrow maybe or the next day
when i get more dope now just lay off
me i dont blame you for being sore at
this job but thats no reason why you
should pick on a poor kid about a third
your size
  springtime let go and johnny backed
away and smoothed himself down he still
had the dark blue knickerbocker suit which
the professor had bought him for the
checker match and he was taking great
care of his appearance now that he was
living in good society he nodded mysteri-
ously and went to the door
 its good stuff he said  good stuff
chapter xv
the encyclopedia of all knowledge
springtime worked for almost a
straight hour the next morning but at
the end of that time he simply had to
get up and look out of the window and
once out of his chair the effort of getting
back to it was beyond him the schoolboy
dragging himself to school with reluctant
feet was a race horse compared to spring-
time and when he did pull himself back to
his work it was with the painful exertion of
the runner dragging himself over the last
ten yards to the tape once down he
worked in spasmodic bursts and finally got
up in such a rage that he kicked over a
measure of beans
   why the hell i do this i dont know
pulling the chair up against the bin he
sat down to sulk at noon he was still in
the chair tipped against the bin osborne
made no adverse comment on seeing him
but ran his hands through what beans he
had done and said  thats better youre
developing a fielding eye when he had
gone johnny slipped in and stood inside the
door so that he could watch the pathway
leading to the shed
   ive got the dope springtime the real
doughnuts now if you can get away with
this the old guy  give you a house and
lot and youll never have to pick another
bean as long as you live
  johnny peered out again
   can you pitch he asked
   no
   thats bad thats bad i had an idea
you could but maybe we can work it some
other way do you reckon you could get a
good pitcher somewhere
   look here kid spill it youre just
flapping in the wind now
   this guy osborne said johnny  hes
a magnate-baseball magnate hes got a
team here and hes got his mouth all set for
beating another team at that burg of han-
over you know how these little towns are
                          a
the bird of passage

springtime they just naturally tear each
other to pieces over a baseball champion-
ship this last series they played this slim-
mer came out a tie but each one claimed
it was all wrong because each had got a
decision that was bad and lost a game on it
well the old boy told me that they decided
to play one post season game to settle it
and right at the last minute the old boys
pitcher walks away and doesnt come back
hes darn near crazy now and i have a
hunch that the man who got him a pitcher
could have the world and half this town-
ship
   i sat down in a store while he was chin-
ning about it and i got the whole layout-
years ago they didnt have nothing but
home talent and sure it must have been a
scream to see these hicks playing at being
ball players then about five years ago ac-
cording to the old mans story a stranger
appears on this hanover team and that
year hanover won hands down but the
next year old osborne had a stranger of
his own and since then i guess its been a
case of who could buy the most players
just between you and me i think theres
been some dirty work at the crossroads and
that that hanover gang has bought up that
pitcher
   but heres the point old-timer you and
me go out and get a pitcher that  win and
that guy  let you off on the bean picking
give us a gold watch apiece and probably
ask you to marry the jane theres hun-
dreds of good ball players hitting the road
this time of year-guys thats been playing
with factory teams all summer and now the
seasons over theyve been let out its a
pipe
  springtime whistled
   son youre a walrus just leave this to
me ill catch the old boy after lunch
osborne smoked a pipe at the stable after
each and every meal and when he had set-
tled down to it springtime said lightly
sure id like to see a ball game
a spurt of blue smoke told him he had
registered but osborne gave no other sign
for five minutes then he took his pipe
from his mouth and said  do you play
 no-that is not much
  another silence broken at length by os-
   	a
bornes saying  id give my front teeth to
find a good pitcher
  springtime yawned
   maybe i could find you one
   ah-huh where
   oh along the road ive seen every-
thing in the jungles-doctors lawyers col-
lege boys painters crooks and ive seen
some of em playing ball around the yards
there are a lot of drifters that play ball with
factory teams they get a good job while
the season lasts with nothing to do but sign
the pay roll and play ball once a week
then when the seasons over they drift i
bet i could pick up a good one in a week or
so
   im darned if i see said osborne slow-
ly  why  set so much store by one
picayune ball game but i feel that if han-
over walked away with that pennant i could
never look my family in the face again
im a small-towner and i reckon every
small-towner figures his place is about
heaven and new york combined plus a
dash of the garden of eden that hanover
bunch ought to be trimmed and id give
my right arm to see them get it
   well i might be able to get a pitcher
whod do it if its going to be a pitchers
battle of course you cant tell it prob-
ably wouldnt be worth the trouble
   the hell it wouldnt how much would
a guy like that want
   oh fifty and expenses would get the
best in the world
  osborne opened a wallet and peeled off
a couple of bills laid them on the window
sill and got up
   see what you can do he said as he
walked away  only be sure to bring him
back here-thats all
  sure said springtime trying in vain
to keep the delight out of his voice  you
dont need a band do you i could pick up
a good band and they would come for their
expenses you might have to find instru-
ments for them
   no said osborne shaking his head  i
have a band
   or an umpire asked the wanderer
putting the bills away in his pocket  i
could probably get a first-class umpire
   you get a pitcher and youll have done

argosy-allstory weekly
your share said osborne  and be sure
you bring him back here
  springtime felt the threat under the last
words-the threat of what would happen to
him if once on the road he let his feet run
away from him but if he were successful
in getting a pitcher for the old man it must
mean that he would take him out of the
bean house for good springtimes mind
simply would not think of how long it would
take to do forty bushels of beans at the rate
he had been going life simply wasnt long
enough osborne got up and knocked the
ashes out of the pipe and springtime rose
with him his spirits going up like a hot air
balloon
    i take it the boy  stay here said
osborne  i had a chin with the missis
about him this morning she says weve
all been on the wrong track with him by try-
ing to force him to tell where he used to live
she reckons the universe is run by love and
shes going to get it out of him thataway
xows as good a time as any when you aint
around to throw out the currents
  springtime laughed and threw his arms up
above his head
   you hang onto him then he answered
 ill sneak it out without letting him see
me go its a dirty trick to play on a poor
unsuspecting boy but it aint half of what
hes done to me so-long
   excuse me but just when will you be
back
   when i get a pitcher
   one week from to-day
   right you are chief
  springtime stepped out into the alley
gingerly-as though his good luck were so
fragile that he did not dare to test it but
as the certainty grew in him that he was
free he began to run-to run as though the
bean shed had taken legs and was pursuing
him
  for three glorious days he roamed sense-
lessly and magnificently drunk on the sense
of freedom in his pocket he carried a base-
ball and at even jungle or hangout he
took it out and began to toss it in the air
or bounce it against the side of a building
that was sure to bring out somebody- who
wanted to play catch and it did not take
springtime long to see whether or not the
man on the other end had anything on the
ball the weather was golden october the
brakemen were so kind that they almost
helped him on and off trains he had money
and he slept and fed like the king of the
road realm that he was now that the tide
was released springtime felt how strong it
had been and under what pressure he had
been while a prisoner in the galvanized iron
shed
  he found one man with speed and an-
other with curves but one was a shallow-
headed lad and the other a middle-aged man
with unmistakable signs of dipsomania upon
him on the third day he came to a good-
sized town and while looking for a fair
hotel he passed a small park on the edge of
which an orator on a soap box was talking
violently the american flag covered the
railing on which his grimy hand lay but
from his vehement manner springtime
judged that what he was saying was thinly
veiled americanism
  there is no place in the world where
political opinions are more violent than in
hoboland and springtime had heard and
seen good arguments on the subject of prop-
erty from men who never owned more than
a dollars worth of anything at any one time
in their lives he stopped to listen and as
he turned away he saw that an opposition
orator had opened-a tall thin man who
stood on his box and looked fixedly under
his hand at some mysterious point in the
sky about him were a half dozen loungers
also peering at the sky and as the contagion
of curiosity increased people began to drift
over from the vehement orator to the star-
gazer
  springtime was among them springtime
smothering laughter that would not be
smothered for the new orator was durkin
whatever his graft might be it was bound
to be worth watching and springtime
pushed himself forward until he was under
the tall mans nose when durkin with-
drew his eye suddenly from that mysterious
point in the sky the first man his gaze fell
upon was his old friend springtime the
second man be saw was the constable who
was on hand to see that nothing was said or
done that iolated a dtyr ordinance know-
ing that there must be some sort of dty rule
the bird of passage

against begging or taking up collections for
personal purposes springtime wondered
what durkin could have to say that con-
stable had not been able to make anything
out of the political economy jabber of the
other orator and he was roaming with hos-
tile eye
    friends said durkin suddenly bring-
ing his hand out in a graceful sweep  im
here to answer any and all questions that
you may have to offer any question on
any subject and i will give you an answer-
a correct answer politics science religion
languages history-anything now who
wants to ask the first question he leaned
forward and said in a sort of jail whisper
without moving his lips  start em off
springtime and ask me how far it is from
the earth to the sun
    sure said the other in the same sort
of voice and asked aloud  how far is it
from the earth to the sun
   ninety-two million eight hundred and
thirty thousand miles said durkin rolling
out the numbers as though he were calling
a list of stations on a railroad  ninety-
two njuion eight hundred and thirty thou-
sand whats next
   since the crowd while interested had not
yet shown any inclination to take part in the
yame springtime asked another question
 how big is it
    the sun said durkin  has a diame-
ter of eight hundred and sixty-four thou-
sand miles
    how big is the earth asked a voice
and durkin answered with the same unctu-
ous rolling out of big figures  the earth
upon which we live is eight thousand and
odd miles in diameter
   how big around
   twenty-four thousand you can figure
that for yourself friend for the circum-
ference of any circle is two pi times the
radius next question
  whats socialism asked a voice and
the laugh that followed told that most of
durkins audience had come from the neigh-
iwring congregation
   socialism said durkin without a
pause  can best be defined by a story
two irishmen were talking politics and one
ud to the other  pat whats socialism
c socialism said pat  means that if i have
two million dollars i give you one million
	well said the other  does that mean that
if you have two pigs you give me one of
them  go long wid yes said pat you
know i have two pigs next question
come along friends shake it up here
ill give you a few facts does anybody
here know what the national debt of czecho-
slovakia is no it is fifty million seven
hundred and thirty-eight thousand eight
hundred and sixty-two kronen figuring ex-
change at normal didnt know that did
you what is the proportion of suicides in
the sexes dont know three times as
many men kill themselves as women-
theres a reason somewhere
   hey said a small bald-headed man in
an office coat  whats the weight of wire
in the brooklyn bridge
   eight thousand and odd tons said
durkin smoothly  and the odd is four hun-
dred and thirty-two and a fraction
  the questions came thick and fast now-
durkin could not answer them all but he
picked them here and there and gave a
quick and clean reply neither did he ig-
nore any question that was persistently
asked
   whats the tallest building how tall
is it how high is the woolworth build-
ing how high is it whats the worlds
biggest city the biggest passenger ship
wrhich of these two men shall i vote for
   at the last question durkin took the lith-
ographed poster out of the hand of a man
who had been waving it under his nose and
held it up so that the crowd could see it
  it showed pictures of opposition can-
didates for city treasurer springtime
thought that durkin must be stumped by
that but there was no alarm in the mans
face and he did not hesitate a moment
   what the office needs is a man not
afraid to do his duty-a man familiar with
figures-a man not to be influenced by
favor interest or fortune one might say
that in some respects henry was a better
man than glasgow but that does not nec-
essarily mean that a man in voting for
glasgow would throw his ballot away
glasgow is a good man as men go we
mustnt ask for perfection in these clays

argosy -allstory weekly
for the reason that we wont get it per-
sonally i favor the right-hand one but
cast your ballot for the man according to
your conscience either that or toss for
it
  he passed the lithograph back quickly
and clapped his hands together
   next question
  they came thick as hail and springtime
almost doubled with laughter listened to
durkin who for a quarter of an hour kept
up a stream of answers some of them ac-
curate all of than crisp and when he was
fairly pinned he managed to wriggle out
under cover of a joke of some son by
this time the earnest gen deman on the op-
position box had no audience at all for
they all had crowded to durkin and when
he saw them at the height of their numbers
and good nature he put out his hand and
said
    is there anybody here who would like
to contribute to the cause
   what cause asked a voice in the
silence that followed
  li oht any cause said durkin without
moving a muscle of his face i am tak-
ing contributions for the cause-that is my
assistant is taking them
   easy cautioned springtime the
bulls onto you
  the constable as the meeting approached
a stage where he would be justified in sus-
pecting the speaker of being a plain beg-
gar had crowded forward until he stood
almost at durkins feet
   this gentleman here said durkin
pointing to springtime  will pass among
you with his hat off and while it is against
the law of this city for me to take a col-
lection he will try to catch any money
that seems to be floating in the air in his
hat you may be sure that that money
will go to the cause
  springtime with a look at the nonplused
constable took off his hat and holding it
out began to circulate through the crowd
which had seen the joke and was responding
nobly wherever he walked a ripple of
laughter followed him and almost even one
gave something-from a penny up-for the
quarter of an hour of amusement which
durkin had afforded them springtime
came back to durkin with his cap bulgin
with small change and the tall man with
a nod of thanks to the few who lingered
poured the money into his pockets arte
got down and walked away through the
park with an affable nod to the coosuble
springtime walked with him with an oc-
casional side glance of wondering admira-
tion this exquisite half hour came as 
beautiful climax to his three wonderful days
of wandering
  at a restaurant door durkin stopped
slipped his arm through that o his com-
panion and led him in he took off his
hat and ran his hand over the brow that
sheltered so many mysteries and sighed
    steak eggs coffee hot cakes pie he
said  you eat boy
    durk said springtime after the wait-
ress had gone to the kitchen  how do you
do it i thought i had a nerve but you-
    it wasnt so bad was it said durkin
  i was hungry son and hunger is the
mother of invention i spent about four
hours in the public reading room going
through the big almanac and then came
out primed the hicks asked iust about
what i thouafct they would althou they
almost had me stopped a couple of times
you know ever since roller left me ive
been more or less put to it
   ah said springtime  i thought he
wouldnt stand for that walloping
   springtime said durkin  have you
no faith in human nature have you no
ideals it wasnt the walloping that did
it-it was my example in quitting ive
never done anything that roller didnt try
to do but he always sticks to it and puts
it across my going home started him to
think about it and im darned if one morn-
ing he didnt up and leave me saving he
was going back to his home town which
i believe he called snakewood he went
and i havent seen or heard of him since
and i dont imagine that i shall see or hear
of him hell stick ive had to think
pretty fast now and then about getting
things to eat what kind of a graft are you
on but wait dont answer now for 
dont think i can give you the undivided
attention you deserve while all this food is
in front of me
the bird of passage

  there was silence for a time while dur-
kin ate then at the end when he had sent
to the cashiers desk for a package of ciga-
rettes and had one of them between his
lips he waved his hand to his companion
and springtime said  im looking for a
baseball pitcher
  so said durkin what kind of a
pitcher
   good one minor league stuff
  he outlined the situation that existed at
napoleon gave him a brief description of
napoleon but omitted kitty and the beans
durkin listened thoughtfully and at the
end was silent until they had left the res-
taurant and found a seat near the cannon
in the park then durkin upon whom
springtimes narrative seemed to have made
a profound effect asked  how much is
there in that pitching job
   fifty and keep the game comes off
in a week or so
   fifty and keep said the other medi-
tatively and after a long thoughtful pause
spread his hands out before springtime
   see those hands
   sure i do and if i were a bull i would
say that they had never done any hard
work
   no but those two broken fingers came
from baseball
   from baseball exclaimed springtime
 durk i always figured you for an eng-
lishman-a duke or something without a
belfry to ring in
   ive lived there off and on said dur-
kin  but boy im a blowed-in-the-glass
yank and once upon a time i was the cap-
tain of a team
   where
  durkin politely ignored that question
but said  it was a pretty good team too
ive gone south with the robins in spring
but i never came back north
  when all this information had pene-
trated and springtime saw its implications
he was acutely embarrassed he was bound
to durkin by class loyalty and a sincere
admiration for the great mans qualities
hobo might be against hobo but hoboes
together against die world and he felt that
durkin would be justified in expecting him
to turn over the pitching graft to himself
whether he could win or not at the same
time he felt doubts as to durkins ability
to stick and this job needed some one who
could pitch and who would stick for even
if he did not owe an unmixed loyalty to
osborne he was more or less afraid of dou-
ble-crossing the old man
   gee durk he said  would you
stick
  durkin said not a word or made a move-
ment to indicate that he had heard after
they had chatted about other things for an
hour he got up and said  well be drift-
ing son you may have to cover a lot of
ground before you find that pitcher
  springtime had thought those three days
preceding his meeting with durkin as be-
ing a glimpse of paradise but they were
nothing to the three that came after when
with the weather still kind the brakeman
even more courteous and money still in
his pocket he found all his former pleasure
doubled by the presence of durkin
  the tall man had an instant apprecia-
tion of everything humorous or interesting
that ran along with his own in addition
he was the pink of courtesy and kindness
in all the little amenities which make hobo
life as well as drawing-room life possible
he was thoughtful unselfish polite almost
to exaggeration and springtime understood
howr it was that roller had stood for his laz-
iness for so many years it was worth sup-
porting durkin just to be with him he paid
not with the sweat of his brow but the
finer coin of his gentility deep in his
heart springtime began to feel that he had
found his pal-the man with whom he
could spend the rest of his days wandering
from bangor to melbourne
  at the end of the third day he had found
no one and he began to be a bit worried
when he had left osborne it had seemed
the simplest thing in the world to go out
and lay his hand on a better pitcher than
any that had ever hurled for napoleon
but he found that for some mysterious rea-
son or other baseball players were extreme-
ly scarce in the jungles he found every-
thing else from dry point etchers to invent-
ors of wave machines but no ball players
worthy of the name durkin saw his
worry and at the end of an unsuccessful

   ad xu doct remember	
scr  mrs osborne was saying  -
a churth
   i kidw i ve v m  school at 
church said johnny  but i cant re-
member anything about what they losk
like ive just gx a feeling of having beei
tbere-thats ali	
  of course said mrs oshxtse am
smoothed a kick of hair away fito tbe
boys brow  ad you deal rraesic
what your town looks like i rrxr-
whether or not h bas a kx of streets or jes
a few and what the principal buildings a--e
like
the bird of passage

  johnny put his hand on his forehead and
thought hard
   no maam not a thing i just re-
member  town if you know what i mean
but i dont remember anything about the
town
   of course i know just what you do
mean dear boy but how about any play-
mates-dont you remember any jacks or
toms or harrys that you used to play
with
   lets see said the lad  lets see
jack-no tom harry no maam
its all gone clean out of my head
   but you said that there was a ball
team there and my husband told me that
he knew it was a white house and that
there was an iron dog in the front yard
 is that so i dont remember the
house and the dog but i do remember the
ball park sure i do i got hit on the
head out there-gee it was a peach of a
clout it was a big day-fourth of july
or decoration day and there was such a
crowd that the field was crowded and the
stands full i was standing right behind
the third base line and a low foul got me
right smack on the napper
  ah said mrs osborne and spring-
time and osborne could see her stiffen
 you were struck on the head
   was i gee i was cold most of the
day and when i did come to i didnt know
what had happened to me i carried a
goose egg under my hat for a week
  mrs osborne held johnny off at arms
length and ran her hand over his head she
was bristling with interest and pity
   my poor poor boy 
  osborne at this juncture coughed and got
into motion his wife immediately flew to
him and dragged him and springtime off
out of range of johnnys ears
  he cant remember she whispered
 i knew there was something strange about
that boy the moment i laid eyes on him
hes not normal-his head is asymmetrical
from a blow he received in childhood
what he needs is medical attention instead
of a lot of bullying from two men an
operation to relieve the pressure on his
brain no wonder the poor lamb does not
know where he lives
  springtime drew away to conceal his
emotions and johnny slapped him in the
middle of the back
   springtime you snitcher what do
you mean by running away without me
gee i had my face all set for a spell on the
rods and then you drift and leave me be-
hind it aint been so bad though said
johnny with an impish grin  gosh this
house is easy a guy could get away with
murder wipe up the blood bury his own
dead and never get caught but whats
the dope did vou get a pitcher
   sure i did durk
  durk yelled johnny good old
durk sure id like to see that guy hes
a great gun springtime hes a card and
no mistake lead me to him
   lead yourself you double-barreled lit-
tle liar i heard the stuff you were spilling
to the missis durks at the railroad
house
chapter xvi
big six
what the state house massacre is
in the history of boston what the
ringing of the liberty bell is in
philadelphia that post-season game is in
the chronicles of napoleon
  the day dawned bright and clear as only
october days can be the crowd that filled
the ball park contained every able-bodied
man woman and child from all but the
key industries of the two cities tom os-
borne had secretly engaged a band from a
larger neighboring city which with a slight
alteration on caps collars and bass drum
became the napoleon premier band
  springtimes fears for durkin had be-
come somewhat softened as he had watched
the pitcher working out on the diamond
that he was a good ball player there could
be no doubt-and that first sense of appre-
hension had slowly vanished as the days
went by and he saw no signs of any un-
steadiness in his protege he and durkin
stood at the entrance to the dressing room
watching the crowd drift in and in the tall
mans eye there was just a glint of con-
tempt as he received and returned the

argosy-allstory weekly
greetings of the many friends he had enter-
tamed on the porch of the railroad house
  -	springtime he said speaking oat of
the corner of his mouth and in such a
guarded tone teat be could not be heard
five feet away  bringing me to this town
was the best thing you ever did few me
   -	so
   yes what are you going to do after
this game is over 
   darned if i know durk- what are
yon
  -	drift my boy-drift west caliior-
nia is a slick pace for the cold months im
wintering there better come along boy
   	i wish i could yearned springtime as
the vzenderiusi began to well up in him
 i wish i could
   well why cant you asked durkin
with a keen look springtime i have an
idea about you and boy im going to
save you i have an idea that jane is after
you and thar youre falling for it its all
wrong son all wrong any guy that can
hoid down a train the way you can hasnt
any business taking on family worries
now well have a stake when i get through
here-a good one understand me a good
stake something that will keep us both for
most of the winter provided we dont waste
our patrimony understand a good fat
stake
   springtime looked at him and his heart
seemed to turn over in his breast there
was the faintest sort of flutter to durkins
left eyelid and springtime seeing it felt
ail his old apprehensions returning
    oh my good gosh durk what are you
talking about
    easy dont spill it to the world these
hicks are just dripping with coin and it
would be criminal to let on have it when
its dying out bitterly to get into the right
hands well have our share of it when the
games over
   springtime grasped durkin by the fore-
arm and looked him in the eye durkin
returned the look and nodded
    its thjgj way springtime the lord
made money for the people that know how
to use it- you and i do and just between
us well make a raid on some of this boob
coin well stick the hicks springtime
iust the way they would stick us if they had
the chance
  	durk said springtime in a whisper
 you arent throwing the game 
   keep your eye peeled and your mouth
shut and youll see some good ball played
said durkin  and after the game open
your mouth and  fill it thats all
springtime looked at his cool companion
in a fever of apprehension he could un-
derstand the pitchers position thoroughly
could see how any real hobo would feel
more or less justified in skinning  scissor
bills yet for him there were so many com-
plicating factors unless the game were
thrown so cleverly that no possible suspicion
could be entertained the burden would fall
upon him and at the thought of the hoid
which osborne had on him and what he
could do with it the cold sweat broke out
upon his forehead in addition there was
kitty who had shown almost as much in-
terest in the game as her father
  t dont do it pleaded springtime
 dont do it durk you couldnt get
away with it in a thousand years and if
anything goes wrong i get hell thats a
just plain hell im asking you as pal to pal
dont do it
  durkin laughed and shook his head
   springtime i tell you youve gone to
hell since you saw that jane in the old
days you would have slapped me on the
back and cheered me on she has you
stopped boy your morale is all shot and i
reckon its up to me to do a little missionary
work and drag you out of here gee
springtime this is the first i ever beard of
your being scared by scissor bills buck up
old son and let the little fixer take care oi
you
  some one hailed durkin from the dress-
ing room and before springtime could get
another word to him the pitcher had slipped
away under the stands he stood for a
moment panic-stricken wondering what he
could do then ran after durkin but his
find was already out on the field pitching
slow balls to a batter who lofted them for
fielding practice he went back and found
a place alongside osborne wondering how
he could get himself out of this scrape ii
there was a scrape there was some com-
the bird of passage

fort in the thought that if durkin did throw
the game he would probably do it so clever-
ly that it could not be detected
  hanover opened proceedings with a band
of its own-not uniformed but it had a
colored conductor dressed like a minstrel
man all the uniforms that should have
gone to the players had evidently been con-
centrated on the drum majors tall figure
and when he stood up in front of the bleach-
ers to conduct that band flitting dancing
and singing in a mellow voice there was a
ripple of appreciation even from napoleon
  but a group of grave napoleon business
men-bankers merchants manufacturers-
had spent a quarter of an hour under the
tutelage of the episcopal rector a man who
had in addition to his degree of divinity a
secular degree from a large eastern univer-
sity he had taught them one of the foot-
ball songs of his alma mater-a song that
began with a long melancholy wail such as
one hears at darky funerals when this
wail had been held for a full minute the
band of sober men of business broke into
the following melancholy prophecy
   more work for the undertaker
  nother little job for the casket-maker
  in the local cemetery they are very very busy
      on a brand new gra-a-ve-
  no hope for hanover
  that was a crusher for the opposition
which had nothing to give in reply but a few
feeble cries of  this is a ball game not a
concert  give that calf more rope
somehow or other the thing took and the
napoleon bleachers caught it where it rose
from first one comer then another and pil-
lars of churches slapped one another on the
back with delight
  when the team trotted out on the field
for warming up practice no one noticed
durkin-for two or three minutes then
some sharp-eyed lad in the hanover section
began to point and passed the word to an-
other and so on until every one in the
enemys stands was pointing to the stranger
who after fielding a few bunts wrapped
himself up in a sweater and began to warm
up his pitching arm springtime could see
that durkin even in practice was making
an impression upon the opposite side from
his own backers came encouraging cries
 atta boy durk the old shine ball
  from hanover came a feeble cry of
 ringer and at the word tom osborne
groaned as if in agony
   that from them
  the presence of the new pitcher put the
tin hat on an occasion already popping like
the warm near-beer that was being peddled
when durkin wound up and pitched his
first slow ball there was a dead silence that
silence became funereal as one hanover
batter after another fanned the ambient air
and retired to the bench
  when the half inning ended and durkin
trotted in to the bench he was the only
unmoved being among the hundreds present
napoleon was slapping itself on the back
and trying in vain to keep its seat and learn
all the words to the new song hanover
rallied to the support of its own pitcher
who went to the mound
  as osborne had said his team was strong
on offense and with its defense tightened
by the pitching of durkin it really looked
as though victory would perch where it was
used to perch in the ages gone by-on the
banner of napoleon
  in three innings neither side scored but
when durkin was in the box the sound of
bat connecting with ball was rare and then
there were only pop-up flies to the infield
on the other hand it was only by playing
a desperate defense that hanover kept the
champing enemy from racing across the
plate one had the feeling that there was a
leak in the dike and that there was only a
very small boy with a small thumb to keep
the tide back and that boy was rapidly
weakening
  the funeral song rose more and more
often in the napoleon stands kitty more
and more often punched her father on the
shoulder with her closed fist and asked
 are you happy old-timer
  springtime sat with his hands tightly
clenched wondering when the catastrophe
was to occur it was a great day for john-
ny who was fielding bats for the home team
and carrying on a spirited line of repartee
with a stray hanover fan who had somehow
got into a seat just above the players bench
  in the fifth the dam broke beginning with

argosy-allstory weekly
a low two-bagger that sailed just over the
third basemans head and fell just short of
the outfielders durkin was on the other
end of the stick and springtime seeing him
hesitate before getting into motion sang
out  beat it durk the bull for of
all the interested spectators of the game
slim mccabe was the most interested he
lounged at the end of an aisle with his tall
raw-boned figure looming supernaturallv
against the glare of the field
   that cry was instinctive but even if dur-
 kin heard it he paid no attention his hit
 seemed to surprise him so much that it took
 some time for him to get his long legs in
 motion and when he did run it was only the
 frantic yells of the coacher that drove him
 on to second there he perched safe with
 the hardest hitting man on the team at bat
 the net result was two runs in that inning
 for the home team while the score board
 showed a blank for the visitors spring-
 time breathed a big sigh of relief
   but in the seventh things began to hap-
pen-the dark and fatal seventh the un-
dertaker song proved to be a boomerang
it was easy to learn and when without a
reason apparent to any one but springtime
durkin walked two men the long wail arose
on the other side
    oh my good gosn said springtime
 this is it
    thats the trouble with you bums said
 osbome in a panicky whisper  you dont
 last
  with two on bases and the hanover
stands howling for blood a low liner went
straight to durkin he fielded it easily and
then dropped it and after hunting a long
time in the dust recovered it and threw
to first it was a wild throw a high one
that no one could have got without a butter-
fly net by the time the ball was back
in his hands three men had raced over the
plate the catcher walked slowly out for
a conference tom osborne was white and
kittys pounding on his shoulder had
changed to a patting of his hand
   springtime looked about him with a
guilty feeling and pulled his cap over his
eyes for he wanted to hide from the world
the man who had introduced this viper into
its trusting midst durkin was as cool as
any cucumber that ever came out of an
ice box he took his place on the bench
and wrapped a sweater about himself with-
out a quiver and answered the questions
and advice of his teammates with the great-
est coolness johnny was reduced to more
or less mechanical remarks which he uttered
in a shrill voice that could have been heard
a quarter of a mile
  attaboy attaboy killem eat
em alive
  springtime seeing mccabes tall figure
shifting from one foot to the other as a
standing horse does had a flash of inspira-
tion as far as he could remember dur-
kin had never seen the great constable nor
did he know that this was the town through
which true travelers traveled in the middle
of the night with their virility numbed no
matter how great their number he got up
and made his way to a place just above
durkin where by leaning over die rail he
could just reach down and touch the
pitchers shoulder
  durkin got up and springtime said in a
whisper  say durk did you know that
this was slim mccabes town
   no said durkin and even his thin
hard-muscled face blanched a little
   sure it is whispered springtime  and
hes got his heart set on winning this game
durkin wiped his face with his sleeve and
said  thanks
  when amid the jeers of the hanoverians
he went up to bat he lammed out a daisy
clipper and when springtime took his place
beside tom osborne the strained expression
on his hosts face had vanished durkin
was on third by that time but did not get
home before the inning ended
  the damage was done heartened by their
success the hanover infield held like a stone
wall until in the last of the eighth durkin
hit a ball that seemed to take wings to itself
it rose and rose and when it came to earth
it lay outside the fence and durkin bad
clicked across the plate in the ninth he
wound up like a clock spring and pitched a
ball that no one could see and held his own
gains
  springtime detached himself from the
jubilee meeting outside and went into the
dressing room under the stands durkin
the bird of passage

was receiving the congratulations of his fel-
low players and of such magnates as had
enough pull to force their way in as a king
would-calmly as though it were only to
be expected that he would do great things
springtime and he glanced at one another
and in that glance was the history of the
things that had happened
   good work said springtime
  and durkin  thanks wait for me
will you old chap i may need some help
they lingered until all the players had
departed and the tramping of feet above
them had ceased and then they left through
the small gate durkin looked about him
and after a survey began to walk rapidly
forward toward the mass of moving vehicles
behind which he might find concealment
but a tall man who looked like a respectable
business man intercepted him and glaring
at him said  snitcher
  durkin drew himself up and turned to
springtime
   an attempt was made he said  to
bribe me in the interests of clean sport i
thought it best to lead the emissary on
just to see how far he would go if there
is any attempt at violence i want you to be
a witness and to report the true course of
events some money changed hands if
tainted money can be cleansed by being em-
ployed in good work this will be for it is to
be an anonymous contribution to the star
of life mission and if you say another
word ill clout you
  he swung up that mighty fist which had
brought victory out of defeat and the man
who had accosted him fell back with mut-
tered threats durkin did not wait for
more he stepped out briskly with spring-
time in his wake and said in a clear voice
 you wouldnt believe it old chap but
there are people who think that a mans
soul could be bought and sold just like so
much soap
  as always when he was with durkin
springtime was on the verge of the most
satisfying laughter he had ever known but
that which came to his lips died
  they were approaching a road with a car
track crossing it and beside the car track
directing the traffic stood slim mccabe
tall gaunt raw-boned with just the same
sort of small glass-green eye as gahagans
under the flannel shirt his shoulders looked
to be a yard wide and in a big fist dangled
a length of hickory stick hard as iron with
just enough elasticity in it to give it the
punishing power of a blackjack
  springtime plucked durkin by the sleeve
to draw him another way so that they
would not pass under the tigers eye but
durkin shook his head and held to his
course people leaned from machines to
shout congratulations and for each he had
a nod an apt word or a witticism they
stopped at the edge of the roadway to let a
string of cars pass and durkin said  well
springtime are you satisfied
   sure i am durk gosh i was sure
windy for a while you dont know how it
is with me
   its that girl said durkin  youre in
a bad way springtime after we get the
coin we drift you and me
   sure id like to yearned springtime
 but i cant
   why not
   well i cant thats all said spring-
time slightly ashamed at revealing the net
which osborne the hick had spun about
him  in a little while i can but not now
you beat it and ill meet you later
   never  said durkin  with me its
all right to stick a rube but to desert a
friend-nix im staying with you son un-
til the last whistle blows i know its that
jane-i knew it the minute i saw you look-
ing at her and her looking at you you were
perched up on the bleachers there one night
at practise and i saw i had a little rescue
work cut out for me i can find enough
to amuse me in this town and ill stand
by and save you from her and your own
hellish inclinations
  mccabes whistle blew and the traffic
stopped he swung his stick and spring-
time and durkin started to cross the road
and as they passed the officer the pitcher
nodded
                            good evening constable he said
                        mccabes granite eye softened and the
                        hard eye relaxed
                              hello big six said he
to be continued next week
by earl c mccain
  yk casual visitor arriving in salt
  lake city on the morning of june
    	 and unacquainted with the an-
niversary endurance race would have
been amazed at the scene in front of utahs
great capital building across the wide
street before the state house were lined up
twenty-six horses and riders awaiting the
signal that would start them on the six-hun-
dred-mile run to cheyenne
  the race was to be the longest and great-
est endurance contest ever held and never
had the west-in fact the entire country-
shown such interest it marked the anni-
versary of the discovery of the great salt
lake by captain ridger and so far as pos-
sible the horses would follow the same
route taken by the valiant explorer as he
returned to the east
  there were reasons for the unusual in-
terest as well as for the great number of
entries in the race the true westerner has
two great loves peculiar to the section in
which he lives first for the history of the
country with its dangers and hardships
and secondly a natural love for the horse
the creature that next to man was respon-
sible for the winning of the west
  another reason was the large prize of-
fered when the race had first been pro-
posed the two cities at the ends of the route
had each agreed to pay twenty-five thou-
sand dollars to form a purse but at that
time the idea was in its infancy since
then additional prizes by raring associa-
tions newspapers and cities along the route
had been added to the original purse until
it totaled more than had ever been offered
on any single race
  while die horses with more or less shift-
ing about stood ready to start the gover-
nor of utah passed from one to another
handing to each rider a small envelope in
addition to the state seal each envelope
bore the same address  to the governor
of the state of wyoming to the rider
who in front of the capital at cheyenne
should first deliver the envelope entrusted
to his care would go the greatest honor that
both states had ever bestowed upon a
horseman
  to the governor as well as the thousands
the great and the small

who lined the streets to see the start of the
historic event the vast difference in the ap-
pearance of those twenty-six horses must
have been the outstanding feature at the
right of the line a sorrel thoroughbred-
with a turf record envied by many racing
stables-stood nose to nose with a slim-
necked arabian mare from lower califor-
nia but it was to the left that most eyes
were directed
  at that end of the line the governor
paused to look admiringly at a great glis-
tening black stallion that stood a full hand
higher than any animal in the row the
horses eyes big in proportion to his mag-
nificent head and powerful body were
bright and fearless yet of all the horses in
that line he stood the quietest and the
eyes of john dillon his owner and rider
smiling down at the governor as he received
the envelope hinted of the same underlying
courage and strength
  the horse was sagamore who a few
months before had come out of the west
unheralded except for the fact that he was
a full brother to prince royal the seasons
turf sensation the two horses had met on
the track for the first time in the kentucky
derby sagamore had lost that race but
only because his rider-the same man who
rode him now-had sacrificed the honor of
winning for the greater honor of saving a
jockeys life after his horse had overcome
a two-lengths lead and fought his way to
a neck and neck finish	
  sagamore was kentucky bred-sired by
the great royal monarch-but while-still
a suckling colt had been shipped with his
mother to the dillon ranch in colorado
there in the foothills of the rockies and
with the freedom of a wild mustang the
colt had developed into a magnificent
horse combining the whirlwind speed of
his illustrous sire with the marvelous power
and endurance that came from his life on
the open range
  in stature the horse was a giant yet his
size was not the kind to interfere with
speed his chest was wide and deep but
the muscles rippled like rubber bands be-
neath his satin skin and he had the long
graceful lines of the thoroughbred runner
  the contrast in size was especially notice-
able because of the horse that stood at his
left almost in the shadow of the huge stal-
lion the little horse was typical of the
western range of the color known as
 strawberry roan and his shoulder bore
the seared mark of a branding iron any
cow-puncher would have termed him  an
ordinary bronc yet any man who knew
horses would have recognized certain points
about him that meant he had the staying
power
  between the riders there was little differ-
ence in appearance both were small and
wiry and both had the tough enduring
strength that comes from life in the open
the very manner in which they sat in their
saddles was proof that they were trained
riders and about the eyes of each were nu-
merous fine wrinkles caused by looking
over open country beneath a scorching sun
laramie jones worlds champion relay
rider rode the little roan and he smiled
good-naturedly as he addressed dillon
   if size counted for anything in a horse
race im guessin the governor would feel
like rulin me and patsy out
  dillon answered the smile first he was
a quiet man with a friendliness about him
for any man who met him halfway
   i take that to mean you dont figure
the size of a horse cuts any ice
   not in this kind of a race jones said
decisively  gameness ought to win this
race and i guess thats patsys long suit
 he looks like a pretty good little cay-
use dillon replied studying the little
horse  but you know what they say about
a good big man being better than a good
little one
   that dont apply to runnin jones
countered  besides ive seen some little
men with sand enough to offset any weight
handicap
  jones had rolled a cigarette and he
leaned farther toward the big horse to shield
himself from sight while he caught a few
whiffs a moment later the governor
stepped back into the street and all the
riders straightened in their saddles the
official starter stretched a starting rubber
from a steel trolley-pole across the street
in front of the horses as the governor held
up his hand for silence

argosy-allstory weekly
   i suppose all of you men are familiar
with the conditions of the contest he be-
gan  so i hah only make a final appeal
for fair play while you are permitted to
ride any way you like and as far as you
like each day remember that it is your
horse after all that must win the race
whether you are able to conserve your
mounts strength and not kill one of gods
noblest animals in your efforts to win will
depend upon your judgment as a man and
your sense of fair sportsmanship with
that nndprlanding - may the best horse
and rider win
  a deafening cheer sounded as the gov-
ernor concluded his brief address and
walked to the curb then after a glance
at his watch he signaled the starter and
the rubber snapped across the street
  most of the horses had felt the tension
while standing in the street and leaped for-
ward at the start sagamore while stand-
ing quietly before knew that the swish of
the rubber meant a race and his great body
shot forward at the signal but a word
from dillon instantly checked him
  from the capital building state street
extends mile after mile toward the east
and dillon knew full well what that long
stretch of hot pavement would do to a
horses hoofs he slowed sagamore to an
easy gallop and as the horse settled to a
steady gait noticed that the majority of 
the riders had done the same
  xot all of them did however at the
start the sorrel racer and the arabian mare
had started side by side and now perhaps
because each rider was too stubborn to yield
first place to the other were making a race
of it down the street dillon was wonder-
ing at the foolishness of this when the little
roan horse dipped up beside him
    thats a fine way to start them horses
-and the governor watch in after makin
that talk jones remarked
   i suppose its partly the fault of the
horses dillon replied  both of them are
thoroughbreds and pretty high-strung i
think that neither one has any business in
a race of this kind
   youre ridin a thoroughbred yourself
aint you
   yes but my horse is trained to mind
i believe thats the most important thing
in training a horse and ive been mighty
careful of him theres never been another
man on his back
    why isnt he safe
   dillons quiet smile might have answered
that still he added
    hes as gentle as a collie dog but its
one oi my pet theories that you can do more
with a horse that knows only one master
somehow you seem to reach a better un-
derstanding of one another that means a
lot more than pulling the bridle reins
    youre sure right about that jenes
agreed and after that they lapsed into si-
lence as they galloped toward the city out-
skirts
  the highway extends almost due east
from salt lake city to the foothills of the
wasatch mountains a distance of perhaps
twenty miles then it begins a wide-sweep-
ing gentle swing to the left in order to pass
through immigrant gap the first break in
the mighty barrier that stands like a pro-
tecting wall to the wonderful farming coun-
try about the shores of the great sak lake
   until the road swings to the northeast
the elevation is slight so dillon allowed
the big horse to hold a steady gait jones
rode at his side with the ease of a man
long accustomed to the saddle rolling nu-
merous cigarettes occasionally they car-
ried on bits oi conversation though both
had settled to the grind of hard all-dav
riding
   the majority of the other riders had
started out at a moderate speed bu the
longer stride oi the stallion caused him to
gradually draw away from most of these
when thej- reached the first turn and sag-
amore eased up at the beginning of the as-
cent there were only five other riders in
sight- but one of these was laramie jones
and dillon noticing that the little cow pony
was apparently as iresh as sagamore felt 
growing admiration for the shaggy little
beast
   the race had started at seven oclock
and noon found dillon and jones well up
toward the gap the grade had become
steeper and steeper however so both horses
had slowed to an ordinary walk
   the conditions of the race required that
the great and the small

each rider must care for his own mount
and could eat or drink only when conditions
permitted his horse to do so accordingly
when they stopped at a ranch house for
lunch the horses were allowed to drink
sparingly from the watering trough then
led to the stable and fed thirty minutes
had been decided upon as sufficient time to
rest the horses and at the end of that time
sagamore and patsy were back on the road
  a few miles from the ranch they over-
hauled the sorrel runner that had made
such a brilliant start limping painfully from
a sprained tendon in the foreleg it was
understood that no rider could expect any
great amount of help from another but
both jones and dillon dismounted to ex-
amine the horses leg it -was clear that
the animal could not go on and accepting
the advice in the spirit in which it was
given the sorrels rider turned back toward
the ranch house
  with each succeeding mile the road
climbed higher and higher winding in and
out along the sides of the mountains yet
always upward ahead of the riders was the
great cleft known as immigrant gap since
the first mormon wagon trains had found
that opening for their ox teams the two
horses forged steadily toward it
  it was late afternoon when they reached
the top of the range and passed between the
towering cliffs that stand at either side of
the gap for a mile or more the road
twisted back and forth over the crest of the
divide then emerged on the eastern side of
the mountains and began the steep descent
toward sound city
  travel down a steep grade is as difficult
for a horse as hard climbing so both riders
held back their animals on this kind of
going the little horse had a distinct advan-
tage over sagamore yet the big stallion
easily kept his footing
  according to their guide books the dis-
tance from salt lake city was slightly more
than fifty miles yet the setting sun was
tintin- the deeper canons with purple shad-
ows when two tired horses a great black
and a small roan plodded into sound city
  wyoming is one state in which the ga-
rage has not entirely replaced the livery
stable and dillon and jones first gave their
attention to finding suitable quarters for
their horses a two-story frame bore the
sign  hotel and an inquiry here brought
the information that a stable two blocks
away had made special arrangements to
care for the horses taking part in the race
  the arabian mare and another horse en-
tered in the contest-this latter a lean
rangy bay were already in the stable the
arabian was already bedded down but
there was a wheeze in the mares breathing
that jones noticed as soon as they entered
the building
   shes all in he said indicating the
arabians stall  shell be lucky if shes
even able to get to her feet by morning
   sounds as if she may be wind-broken
dillon replied  i suppose her rider crowd-
ed her all the way up from salt lake and
she went to pieces in the mountains this
big bay seems to be all right
   he always is at the start of a race
jones made answrer  thats charley
montauks pathfinder and hed be a great
horse if he could only keep the pace he sets
at the start i rode him two stretches in
a cross-country relay once and he led the
bunch the first day out when i caught
him again on the way back he played out
after five miles and i like to never got to
the next change station he isnt exactly a
quitter but he just cant stay
   he shouldnt give us much trouble
then
   no not him but there are some others
in the race that may before we reach
cheyenne i counted five horses before we
left the lake that ought to be pretty strong
contenders
  after making sure that both horses had
been properly cared for dillon and jones
started to the hotel as they crossed the
street toward the building a man called to
jones from a low-slung roadster drawn up
at the hotel porch
   thats buckley the owner of patsy
jones said to dillon as he checked his step
 come over and meet him if you want to
 i thought patsy was your own horse
 no but he will be if i win this race
ive been tryin to get that little horse for
two years but buckley wouldnt sell i
hate to see buckley own him because he

argosy-allstory weekly
has no more sympathy for a horse than a
car i got his name on a contract to sell
me patsy for three thousand dollars before
i agreed to ride for him but i wont have
the money to pay for him unless i get the
winning riders purse
   thinking that buckley might wish to dis-
cuss the race with his rider alone dillon
entered the hotel and engaged his room
he had finished eating when jones and
buckley came in and took a table and call-
ing for a second cup of coffee dillon lin-
gered to study the owner of the little roan
  buckley was a man of the big-boned
muscular type even from a distance it
was evident that he possessed a dominant
personality he wore high laced boots and
his shirt was open at the throat exposing
a thick neck that indicated bull strength
dillon knew men as well as horses and his
impression was that buckley was a brute
with plenty of power to back his brutality
   there had been a sort of unwritten un-
derstanding that the horses were to travel
from sunup and sundown provided they
were able after another visit to the stable
in which he found sagamore peacefully
munching hay dillon left a call for five
oclock and went to his room he smoked
a last cigar then turned in for the night
   dillons first move the next morning was
to order his own breakfast prepared while
he went to the stable to feed his horse
sagamore greeted him with a snort and
stood rubbing his velvety nose against dil-
lons shoulders as the man examined his
hoofs and legs as he left the stable dillon
glanced into the stall occupied by patsy
and discovered that the little horse had al-
ready left
   he was wondering at joness judgment in
starting so early as he went in for break-
fast but a note given him by the night
clerk explained it read
      sorry we cant ride together but its like
    i thought buckley has staked all he owns
    on this race so hes making me hit the trail
    at three oclock its tough on patsy but hes
    a game little devil ill see you in cheyenne
    anyway
                                       jones
   by the time dillon was ready to leave
sound city all the horses except the arabian
had left the stable jones had been right
in his prediction and a veterinary had been
called to care for the mare if the grueling
climb of the day before had injured saga-
more it was not apparent from the spirit he
displayed as they started
   for the first few miles the highway drops
steeply down toward the plains of wyoming
dillon was forced to ride carefully by nine
oclock he was clear of the foothills and
following a road that resembled a city boule-
vard sagamore wanted to run but dillon
held him at a steady gallop in time they
passed several other horses and the utah-
wyoming state line marked by stone ruin
that had once been a cavalry post it still
lacked an hour of noon when sagamores
hoof-beats sounded on the main thorough-
fare of elliston
  even though dillon learned there were
seven riders ahead most of whom had only
stopped in the town to feed and water their
horses he lingered an hour the rest en-
abled sagamore to start the long fifty-mile
run to fort custer with renewed strength
once out of the town dillon let the big
horse show a bit more speed
  twenty miles from elliston sagamore
overtook a little gray mare that had pushed
on through sound city the night before and
spent the night at a ranch the mare was
running easily apparently in good condition
to finish the race but her pace was hardly
as fast as sagamores and the big black
gradually drew away from her
  it was still daylight when dillon rode
into fort custer yet he turned in at the
towns most inviting livery stable the pro-
prietor a chunky little man who seemed
rather unwilling to leave his chair at the
door to accommodate a patron appeared
surprised that dillon intended to stop for
the night
   theres six riders ahead o you he
stated  theyre all pushin on to flag-
lers ranch fer the night its only bout
eighteen miles and this horse o youm looks
like he could make it fore night
   he probably could but i dont want
to crowd him too fast hes traveling fast
enough to win the way hes going and i
want him to have plenty of strength left
when we reach laramie
                         	a
the great and the small

   half reluctantly the man arose and
 showed dillon to a stall while arranging
 it for his horse the rider asked
     what horse was leading when they came
 through here
     four of em was together a big bay
 they call pathfinder a cavalry runner from
 fort lincoln an iron-gray mare from some-
 where in itah and laramie jones on a little
 roan
     so jones is up with the leaders dillon
 remarked his tone showing that he was
 pleased  hows the little horse holding
 out
     fine i figured him bout the freshest
 o the lot when i looked em over laramie
 sure knows how to handle a horse
    dillon agreed to that readily enough then
 inquired the best place to stop for the night
 a restaurant up the street kept a few fur-
 nished rooms upstairs and after glancing
 over the place dillon decided to remain
 there overnight
    fort custer is one of the most historic
 spots in wyoming and when he had eaten a
 hearty meal in the restaurant dillon took
 a walk through the little town the people
 for the most part are true westerners in
 their manners and dress typical of the cattle
 country in which they live dillon found
 most of them keenly interested in the great
 race 
    the proprietor of a cigar store pointed
 out the ruins of the barracks that had once
 sheltered troopers when they were not en-
 gaged in waging w ar against the hostile utes
 and cheyennes by the time dillon had
 looked the ruins over it was growing dark
    riding all day on horseback even with a
 horse that rides easily is tiresome dillon
 had no difficulty in falling asleep almost as
 soon as he touched the bed he awoke
 at four oclock and by the time the sun
 rose was on his way two other horses
 had reached the fort during the night but
 neither animal had rested sufficiently to
 start early that morning
 dillon walked sagamore for the first mile
on the chance that his leg muscles might
have become stiffened a bit from the hard
ride of the day before the horse seemed
livelier than usual pulling at the bit to be
allowed to gallop so once satisfied of hi
   	a
    condition dillon let him run the long
    stride of the stallion even when held back
    a trifle clipped off the miles before reach-
    ing stranger the big horse passed the cav-
    alry runner a fine well-trained animal and
    later caught up with the iron-gray mare
    the two riders stabled their horses at the
  same place and went to a hotel together
  for lunch at the hotel they learned that
  pathfinder and the little roan still holding
  their fast pace had passed through the town
  two hours earlier
       pathfinders showing better than i ex-
  pected the other rider said to dillon  i
  had heard that he wasnt good for more
  than one days running at fast speed but
  he must be gamer than i thought
     how about joness horse
     game to the core was the quick re-
  ply  endurance isnt so remarkable in a
  good mustang because most of them have
  it but that little devil has speed and staying
  power too ive seen him race before so i
  know what he can do
    the gray mare had shown plenty of speed
  while coming into stranger so dillon made
  no objection to taking the road with her
  after lunch he could have got more speed
  from sagamore had he wished to push the
  big horse but the mare stuck to the pace
  so gamely that he realized that both horses
  could easily reach rock cliffs before night
    in the late afternoon they rode into white
  river stopping only to allow their horses to
  drink it was twilight when they reached
  rock cliffs where they intended to remain
  overnight they learned that the two
  horses ahead of them had pushed on toward
  red bluffs twenty-five miles farther east
    the rider of the gray by one of those
  tricks of fate was the victim of a bad at-
  tack of indigestion during the night though
  dillon did not learn of this until the next
  morning a physician had already been
  called so after wishing his late companion
  a sjeedy recovery dillon saddled saga-
  more and began the days ride he knew
  that for the remainder of the race every mile
  and minute might count because it was half
  over
   it was stil early morning when he
 reached the little town of red bluffs and
 learned that patsy and pathfinder had

argosy-allstory weekly
started before daylight from this point
the highway follows the railroad for some
distance passing through little towns every
eight or ten miles
  in most of these towns the few inhabi-
tants turned out to glimpse the great black
horse that if be stopped at all seemed to
barely wet his muzzle at a watering trough
  at table top where dillon stopped for
lunch the only talk of the race seemed to
concern  that litde roan horse the men-
tion of only one horse puzzled him but he
found the answer to that later in the after-
noon an hour after leaving table top
he overtook pathfinder and after talking a
few minutes with the other rider forged
on ahead pathfinder true to form had
finally weakened from the terrific pace set
by jones and his litde mustang
  it was almost twilight and both horse
and rider were growing tired when they
reached the town of wanderer yet dillon
resolved to push a bit farther crested
ridge w-as only twelve miles away but dark-
ness had settled over the country when
sagamore trotted into the place and dillon
learned the same disappointing news
laramie jones had passed through thirty
minutes before without stopping dillon
had hoped to overtake jones at that place
vet the news increased his admiration for
the litde roan horse
  dillon was back in the saddle by sunup
the next morning galloping on toward raw-
lins which he reached slighdy before noon
after a brief stop he swung back to the
road two hours later he rode through
fort settler and sent sagamore pounding
across the long bridge that spans the platte
river ahead of him loomed the medicine
bow range and the road began to ascend a
short distance from the river in spite of
the grade he allowed sagamore to travel as
fast as he wished reasoning that for the re-
mainder of the trip the horse could be de-
pended upon to do his utmost
  it was dark before he rounded a turn in
the mountains and struck the comparatively
smooth road that swings southward toward
the town of elk mountain the sandy
highway glistening like a wide white ribbon
before him was a temptation for more
speed yet when sagamore voluntarily eased
down a bit dillon did not crowd him he
knew that in spite of the horses splendid
heart and strength the five days race was
beginning to show its effects
  a stead- gallop enables a horse to cover
much ground however and sagamore loped
steadily just as dillon caught his first
glimpse of the lights of elk mountain he
heard the rat-a-tat of hoofs on the road
ahead and sagamore quickened his stride
a mile slipped by before the stallion over-
took the other horse and a wave of gladness
swept over dillon as he recognized tones
and patsy
   you running son of a gun he greeted
in the manner that jones liked best  i
had begun to doubt that i was ever going
to catch you how the deuce do you man-
age to hold that little hoze up
  both horses as if understanding the
friendship of their riders had slowed to a
walk and neither man urged them faster
   it s patsy thats boldin me up jones
laughed  i told you he was dead ame
but im leery about startin him as early as
buckley wants me to each morning a horse
is only capable of doing so much but buck-
ley is the kind of owner that every rider
hates all hes thinkin about is the money
hes got bet on this race
   what became of him after we left
sound city
   hes trailin along in that big car of
his and expectin this horse to make the
same time hell be waitin for us in elk
mountain and i ran imagine his feelins
when he sees that youve finally caught up
with me
  that prediction was true and buckley
appeared at the livery stable while both men
were unsaddling
   whats the matter be demanded of
jones - they tell me you walked your
horse into town just now
   i did dillon here overtook me a few
miles out and we let our horses take their
own time cornin in
   thats a damn fine way to run a horse
race buckley snapped favoring dillon
with a glare in the light of the stable lan-
terns  you  do better to ride alone i m
thinking
   im thinkin the same thing jones re-
the great and the small

 plied evidently striving to control his tem-
 per  im gettin all the speed out of that
 horse he has but you cant expect him to
 keep up with a car
    no but i do expect him to get into
 cheyenne first and hes not going to do
 that and walk
   jones did not bother to reply and a mo-
 ment later buckley left the stable
   they had arrived in elk mountain about
 eight oclock so in spite of the fact that
 the race was nearing its close dillon rea-
 soned that he dared not start sagamore
 earlier than four the next morning it still
 lacked a few minutes of that time when he
 came to the stall and made a discovery
 that left him dumfounded the night be-
 fore he had carefully measured sagamores
 feed because a racing horse must be care-
 fully fed yet the feed box in the stall was
 more than half filled with oats and a sack
 of grain lay near the manger
   dillon leaped into the stall suddenly
 maddened because of the trick that had been
 worked on him he aroused sagamore
 and the horse after a moment got to his
 feet the animal had eaten his fill but
 luckily had not foundered
   dillon hurried to the office stable and
 aroused the night man who directed him to
 the home of the nearest veterinary when
 the man arrived at the stable dillon had
 led the stallion outside and was walking
 him in the street
    well he doesnt seem to be in any dan-
 ger the veterinary said after an examina-
 tion  but he must have a stomach of iron
 you cant ride him faster than a walk be-
 fore noon but hell be all right then
    dillon handed the veterinary a bill then
 turned to the stableman  who was in
 that stable after i left it last night
     nobody until two oclock this morning
 when they started that little roan after
 the horse left that big man who owns him
 came back to the stall for something they
 had left and i heard his car start as soon
 as he went outside
dillon said nothing it wasnt necessary
though he received some satisfaction from
knowing that jones had not been guilty of
the trick he paid the stableman to walk
sagamore while he went to a near-by res-
taurant for a cup of coffee then rode slowly
out of town in his heart was a great bit-
terness against buckley for his attempt to
put a rival horse out of the race by such
foul means
   it was probable that it would cost saga-
more the race because patsy was two hours
ahead while the big horse-with speed and
endurance to win the race by hours-was
forced to walk still dillon valued the great
stallion more than the purse and the honor
of winning so in spite of his feelings he
obeyed the veterinarys orders
   by noon the horse had traveled only
thirty miles but he was gradually recover-
ing from the effects of his feast dillon
gave him a try at galloping then and when
he seemed all right kept him at it though
he was careful not to let him get too warm
after a time he reached a small stream
where he allowed the horse to drink sparing-
ly then continued on his way
   during the long afternoon when he real-
ized the horse was out of danger dillon
turned sagamore loose enjoying the thrill
that comes from hearing the wind sing past
his ears it almost seemed that sagamore
was aware of his blunder and was making
every effort to recover lost time yet they
were still thirty miles from laramie when
dillon stopped at a roadside ranch for the
night
   sagamore greeted his master with a snort
the next morning which meant that he was
ready and willing to start
 its a darned good thing you do feel
good old top dillon said to the horse
stroking the shiny mane as he fed him
 weve got some job ahead of us to ever
catch that little horse
he had traveled a mile when the sun be-
gan tinting the eastern sky that morning
and the horse was running with ease at
twenty minutes after nine he galloped into
laramie joness home town and paused
only long enough for water for himself and
horse
hundreds of persons were watching the
results of the race and a great crowd gath-
ered about the horse when he stopped
some one handed dillon a morning paper
and he was again in the saddle before he
noticed the headlines it read  the little

argosy-allstory weekly
horse wins then followed a statement in
smaller type that jones had passed laramie
thirty miles ahead of his nearest competitor
and would reach cheyenne that afternoon
  dillon tossed the paper away without
reading the story and gave his attention to
riding
   ten minutes was all that dillon took for
lunch feeding sagamore beside a watering
trough while he munched a sandwich he
let the horse drink rather freely then swung
back into the saddle somewhat elated at
the news that jones was less than an hour
ahead cheyenne was less than thirty miles
away yet dillon was doubtful of overtak-
ing the little horse still he reasoned that
sagamore was probably traveling twice as
fast as patsy and he urged the animal for-
ward at racing speed
   twenty miles from the wyoming capital
dillons heart leaped as he sighted a horse
and rider on the road ahead when saga-
more overtook them it proved to be a cow-
boy on his way into town
   perhaps an hour later he met an auto and
 the driver shouted that the leading horse
 was just ahead as mile after mile flitted
 by without him seeing anything of jones
 he began to wonder if the driver could have
 been mistaken then just as he sighted the
 smoke of cheyenne he recognized the little
 roan just topping a slight hill
   patsy was running though it seemed to
dillon that it took a long long time for him
to cross the hill jones was miles ahead
however and dillon leaned over the big
stallions neck talking to him as he sent him
forward at whirlwind speed wondering if
he could hold that pace after such a heart-
breaking endurance test sagamore did
and the sight that cheyenne witnessed will
never be forgotten by those who saw it
   the news that the racers were coming
had long since been telephoned ahead and
the streets were lined with people the gov-
ernor of wyoming a good sportsman him-
self stood in the rear seat of his car and
cheered when patsy game to the last but
overtaxed from lack of rest staggered into
the long street that leads to the capital
   the little roan went to his knees then
regained his feet and came forward the
cheers that greeted the little beast must have
warmed any red-blooded mans heart yet
they suddenly stilled then broke out anew
over the hill at the outskirts of the city
charged a great black horse running with
the speed of his thoroughbred sire as his
flaring mane whipped the face of his rider
  the little cow-horse was six blocks from
the capital when the racing stallion flashed
past jones looked up and smiled and
somehow that smile hurt dillon
   dillon had delivered his letter and was re-
ceiving the congratulations of the governor
when a shout down the street drew his at-
tention instantly he whirled sagamore
and raced down the street he had recog-
nized a low-slung roadster in the street and
a big man who had literally jerked jones
from the saddle of his horse
  whether buckley struck the man or not
dillon wasnt sure but he did see something
that was even worse jones had been flung
to the ground and as buckley caught the
bridle reins of the little horse he swung a
vicious kick to the animals stomach
  ordinarily dillon was inclined to reason
things out but he didnt then as saga-
more answered the tug at the reins dillon
leaped from the saddle onto buckleys
shoulders smashing his right fist into the big
mans face as he landed on his feet buck-
ley staggered back and dillon closed in
sending two blows to the stomach that
dropped the brutal owner to the pavement
  hats were thrown into the air and hun-
dreds cheered themselves hoarse yet dillon
scarcely heard all that he stepped back
and assisted jones to his feet then on sud-
den impulse jerked a folded check book
from his shirt pocket and leaned against
sagamore as he wrote the check was for
three thousand dollars payable to bearer
and dillon showed it to jones before he
turned to buckley
   thats what jones was to pay you for
patsy-and youve just sold him that
horse dillon said quietly buckley hesi-
tated an instant then climbed to his feet
and walked groggily to his car as he drove
away from the jeering crowd dillon turned
to jones-and even the governor joined in
the cheering as they walked down the street
leading their horses-a great black stallion

 without realizing what she was doing she
 found herself at one of the front windows
 on the watch the white figure trotted by
 alongside the park wall and diantha ex-
 perienced the same little shock she had
 approved of randals well-fitting clothes
 how unexpectedly beautiful he was without
 them
   the next day it rained and they did not
 go riding as the afternoon wore on a great
 restlessness took possession of diantha she
 would not examine her thoughts very close-
 ly she was principally annoyed with the
 weather toward nightfall it stopped rain-
 ing and her heart rose strangely still she
 would not ask herself what difference a little
 rain made
   she started to dress for dinner fifteen
 minutes earlier than usual to the great an-
 noyance of her maid that young persons
 dilatoriness exasperated diantha in the
 end she sent her away and finished herself
 in a hurry she had a whole half hour to
 spare dressing for dinner was a ritual
 with the colonel and he was safely out of
 the way for the time being diantha let
 herself down in the elevator with hot cheeks
 a little voice inside her was asking aghast
  what are you going to do what are you
 going to do to which the only possible
 answer was  i dont care im going to
 do it
   there was a footman on duty in the hall
 diantha blushing at her own depravity
 sent him down to the basement on a mythi-
 cal errand then darted into the coat room
 some of their heavier outdoor wraps were
 kept here she got a long plain coat that
 covered her completely and pulled rubbers
 over her satin slippers she slipped out of
 the house leaving the door off the latch so
 that she could get in again without sum-
 moning anybody
   she felt horribly guilty for it was the first
time she had ever deceived the colonel he
had ordered her to break off all relations
with guyon but she could not help her-
self
   it was about forty feet to the comer the
homeward flow of pedestrians up the avenue
had slackened but the street was well filled
with shiny motor cars earning fashionable
folk up and down toward their dinners she
crossed to the park side where it was com-
paratively shadowy under the naked trees
and there were few walkers she went a
block or two uptown at a smart pace listen-
ing breathlessly for the pad of running
feet behind her then turned and came back
more slowly she had almost reached her
own comer again when she saw him coming
along by the wall her heart beat like a
little pneumatic riveter
   she had planned to be greatly surprised
upon meeting him but she was not a first-
class dissimulator she only said oh
rather flatly and stopped she was thank-
ful for the darkness which swallowed her
blushes
   randal stopped dead in his tracks with
his arms hanging you he said he
forgot everything in his hunger for her his
deep-set eyes were like those of a famine
sufferer
   under this terrible gaze diantha became
completely confused  what-what are
you doing she stammered
    running he said solemnly
   the absurdity of both question and an-
swer struck her and she laughed suddenly
his strained face softened wonderfully at
the delicious sound he laughed too the
tension was relieved
   but you mustnt stop said diantha
in distress  youll catch cold
    im going he said but remained glued
to the spot his hungry eyes fixed on her
   an alarming silence descended between
them diantha lost her wits in her con-
fusion she said exactly the wrong thing
 its such a long time since ive seen you
   randal smiled ruefully
a new girl in town

   thats not my fault he said	moment of perfect happiness but almost the
   perhaps i was too hasty murmured	first word destroyed it
diantha	 you said you were sorry you turned me
   oh do you mean that he cried all his	away he said eagerly
 heart in his voice
   you mustnt stop she said al-
 ready you are beginning to shiver
    im not it wont do me any harm
    i must go she said with a sort of
 bustle of preparation but not making any
 actual move
    dont go he implored
   it was sweet to her  but its too ab-
 surd-like this-people are staring at us-
 youll catch cold-
     ill never get another chance to speak
 to you he said desperately
    i know what we can do she said sud-
 denly  the colonel has coats hanging in
 the coat room ill get you one
   oh will you he cried beaming with
 happiness
    run up and down till i get back she
 flung over her shoulder she darted across
 the road
   to her dismay the footman was in the
 hall again she had forgotten about him
 he was greatly astonished to see her enter
   oh mathews she said instantly
 without thought  theres a poor man out-
 side on the corner shivering with the cold
 im going to give him one of the colonels
 old coats
   she ran into the coat room  good
 heavens what a glib liar i am she
 thought
   when she came out with the coat
 mathews said  shall i take it to him
 miss
    no i want the pleasure of handing it
 to him myself
    hadnt i better go with you
    nonsense there are plenty of people
 in the street im perfectly safe you
 stay here
 he could not go counter to her direct
 command but it was with a very disapprov-
 ing air that he let her out
 diantha raced back to the comer ran-
 dal met her on the other side and she helped
 him into the fleecy coat they leaned
 against the park wall and looked at each
 other disconcerted and smiling it was a
   she nodded
     then you have thought over what i told
 you
   diantha drew away from him no
 no no she said you were wrong
 every new day proves to me how wrong
 you were
   he looked away from her sullenly a
 wretched feeling of constraint divided them
   oh dear wailed diantha  why
 must we begin to quarrel as soon as we open
 our mouths
     you wont face things  he muttered
     why should we face things that force us
 to quarrel here we are such a fantastic
 sort of meeting we ought to carry it off
 fantastically not bother with reality
 think what a clever scene it would be in a
 play
   it was impossible for him to hold anger
 against her he loved her so
    but im not clever he said with his
 crooked smile
     well neither am i said diantha
    they laughed and felt better
    why do you run every night she
 asked
    you have seen me before
     yes three nights now
     you think im a fool to do it
  oh no i think its fine it changes
 my whole opinion of you id like- she
 stopped blushing
   he could not speak for pleasure but
 his eyes were eloquent
    i have a confession to make diantha
 said impulsively  i came out on purpose
 to meet you-i wanted to tell you-that i
 felt differently
 his eyes shone with joy  did you
 did you he said breathlessly  how
 wonderful of you 
 his joy confused her afresh
  you havent told me why you do it
 she said hastily
 the light died out of his face  dont
 you know why he muttered  cant you
 guess
 she shook her head

argosy-allstory weekly
   well-i have a sort of confession to
  make to you too i saw you that morn-
  ing-by the little lake in the park
  diantha shuddered
   i wish i could forget that
  tell me how did you happen to be
 there he begged  it torments me
    wanted to stop the fight she mur-
  mured
   he had told you where it was going to
  be
  she nodded
    shouldnt have told you he said
  it was his only word against his rival
  after a while he said  so now you see
  why im doing this to wipe that out
   i understand she said but she did
  not understand she thought he meant
  merely to wipe out an ugly recollection
  there was another and a longer silence
  but this not an unhappy one leaning
  against the park wall they pressed a little
  together each filled with a bliss neither
  dared to acknowledge each supposing that
  the other was unconscious of that intoxicat-
  ing contact
     i dont see why we cant be friends
  diantha murmured at last
     can i come to the house he asked
 eagerly
    well-no stammered poor diantha
  not just at present
    he hates me randal muttered
 gloomily
    thats ridiculous she said
      oh no it isnt i know the reason
     what is it
      i cant tell you if you have not already
  guessed it
    the situation was becoming strained
 again  now youre talking in riddles
 said diantha frowning  tell me plainly
 what you mean
     useless as long as you think im rabid
  on the subject he said dejectedly
      well you are said diantha crossly
  naturally it made him cross and he said
  the thing he had been admonishing himself
  not to say ever since she had come  i
  saw you a few days ago driving with my-
  with mrs cheeseman
    dianthas heart sunk she thought
  oh dear now hell begin on her
    how did you become acquainted with
 her randal asked cautiously
   diantha could not take him into her con-
 fidence of course
    we have become friends she said
 coolly  shes the only woman friend i
 have
   this was gall and wormwood to randal
    shes no fit friend for you he blurted
 out
   nothing could have kept him from say-
 ing it
   he went on to particularize diantha
 listened with a sore heart it was all true
 of course but she could not admit it to
 him she was thinking  the colonel was
 right i dare not be friends with this man
 i have to drive him away from me-or show
 him my hand serves me right for dis-
 obeying 
   she cried aloud with a fine show of
 spirit
    what gets into you that every time i
 make a friend you must slander so hate-
 fully you are one of the kind who be-
 lieves evil of everybody the evil must
 be in yourself
    you shouldnt go by what i say ran-
 dal insisted unhappy and dogged
    i dont i dont she cried  i dont
 pay the least attention to your slanders on
 my friends i forget about it as quickly
 as possible
    but you owe it to yourself to investi-
 gate he persisted  go to anybody you
 can trust and ask for a plain unvarnished
 account of myra folletts career youll
 get it from anybody
   hurt and confused as she was dianthas
 appearance of anger soon merged into the
 real thing she had to get rid of him very
 well best make a complete job of it
    i shant i shant she cried  its
 none of your busines your slanders are
 contemptible im sorry i ever spoke to
 you i shant make the same mistake
 again 
   as she started to run he said  wait
 youre forgetting the overcoat
   she had to wait her face strained away
 from him wriggling out of the coat he
 hung it over her arm she flew across the
 road there was a bit of the fatalist in
a new girl in town

 randal that stood him in bad part at this
 crisis dogged and despairing he watched
 her go
    as she approached diantha saw the col-
 onel bareheaded on his doorstep looking
 toward her with an extraordinary expression
 of anxiety
   diantha he cried thank god
 here you are
   how her sore heart warmed to him how
 it reproached her for deceiving him
   his eyes were upon the overcoat she
 had to account for it somehow she began
 to rattle off the same tale she had told the
 footman
      not a beggar a poor shiver-
 ing man who hadnt any overcoat but
 when i came back with it he was gone i
 looked everywhere i hope you dont mind
 my taking your coat
   oh the coat thats nothing he
 was looking at her with a peculiar sadness
    diantha had an uneasy feeling that her
 story had not made good  the house was
 so hot  she went on lamely  i just w-an-
 dered out for a mouthful of fresh air before
 dinner
     diantha he said softly  i was look-
 ing out of the front window
    oh she cried instantly crushed with
 shame  forgive me for deceiving you i
 soon repented of it indeed i did i did
 i have sent him away
    diantha he said gravely  i have
 never told you the name of the lady we are
 working to save
    this sounded so oddly irrelevant she lift-
 ed her shamed head to stare at him
     it is randal guyons mother
   oh heaven breathed diantha
 aghast  oh now i understand
chapter xix
maneuvers
 myra became daily more enamored of
 her role of dianthas tender wise
 humorous mentor and she played it
 to perfection what a treat it would have
 been to one of myras cynical male friends
 to have heard her with the girl all the time
 in her purring way she was seeking to be-
 cloud the crystal clarity of dianthas mind
 with her own sensuous laissez-jaire phil-
 osophy but if dianthas mind was clear it
 was as hard as crystal also only the col-
 onel could have appreciated how well the
 girl played her part when she was alone with
 myra
 during all their talks diantha never
 ceased trying to find out whether myra had
 some particular object or was just bent on
 mischief generally myra was very chary
 of introducing kirwan sutliffes name but it
 had to come up in the end and then with all
 myras cleverness diantha perceived that
 the older woman was acting as a sort of
 emissary for the man diantha told the col-
 onel and they had a good laugh over this
 odd development in their favor
  help her out help her out he said
 one day diantha asked myra with an in-
 nocent air  what do you think of kirwan
 sutliffe really
  oh my dear drawled myra  i only
 know him as one of hundreds a tall blond
 youth isnt he
  not a youth said diantha demurely
  very much of a man very handsome in
 a masterful sort of way
 myra concealed a smile
  i place him now hawk nose thinks
 pretty well of himself
  well thats better than humility in a
 man said diantha
 after that sutliffe was continually the
 subject of their talk diantha probed myra
 for information she did not get much
 diantha had no doubt in the world but
 that these talks were all duly reported to
 sutliffe and it amused her not a little to
 shape the talk in the way that she desired
 him to get it
  wouldnt you call sutliffe a very pas-
 sionate man she asked myra one day
 myra laughed at her seeming naivete
  why do you think so
  he makes furious love to me
  i thought the most passionate men were
 generally dumb
  i dare say it isnt what he says but
 the way he looks at you scorching it
 bothers me a lot
  why should it
  im not treating him right i cant

argosy-allstory weekly
give in to him yet i dont want to send
him away either
   dont you like the scorching asked
myra
   yes i do said diantha  rather-if i
could stop there
   but why not give in
   i dont know something prevents me
 suppose its because im not sure if its the
real tiling-for me i mean
   how can you find out except by letting
yourself go
   but if i should let myself go said
diantha wide-eyed  and if i found i had
made a mistake how could i ever get my-
self back again
   you dear innocent said myra with a
kindly laugh  thats just girlish non-
sense youre not going to forever lose
your grip on yourself just because you let a
man kiss you once and kiss him back again
to see what its like
   he did once said diantha  and i
didnt like it
  go to it laughed myra it im-
proves girls think-or rather they used to
think-youre a holdover from a more
proper age-that in the first moment of sur-
render some extraordinary change is going
to take place in them nothing in it di
youll find yourself exactly the same wo-
man afterward that you were before
   i would be-er-sweeter to him if i
could without danger
   in a way of speaking you ought to be
nice to him shouldnt you
    yes said diantha  its hard to have
to hurt him so
  nevertheless she frowned
   what is it asked myra
   hes not my ideal my ideal man
would be terribly passionate too but there
would be something else-tenderness i
couldnt let myself go unless i felt jriends
with him
   youve got to take men as you find
them not as you imagine them said myra
sententiously  besides according to you
youve been tormenting the poor devil no
wonder he acts like a bear tenderness
would come out later
   maybe it would murmured diantha
making herself look particularly innocent
 hes never asked me to marry him i
suppose that would follow
  myra smiled to herself
   but i dont want to marry anybody
diantha went on  im quite sure on that
point not for years i dont suppose hed
be content with a long engagement under
the circumstances it would be scarcely hon-
est would it to-even for a moment-
   now youre harking back to 
again said myra  women have been
enfranchised why bother about marriage
until youre ready women have just as
much right now to sample life as men have
thats a thrilling thought said di-
antha demurely
  she went home sorely tempted by the
idea of  sampling life like all warm-
blooded young people she had a mighty
curiosity about life surely she would be
safe in letting herself go just a little she
told herself was it not all in the best of
causes how could she learn about things
as the colonel wished her to learn unless
she tried things out
  when sutliffe came that night she looked
him over speculatively in a purely physi-
cal way he was uncommonly good looking
moreover the passion of the man the sud-
den trembling of his muscular hands the
huskiness of his voice thrilled her but
however much she may have wished to let
herself go something stronger than herself
still forced her to keep him at arm s length
they quarreled sutliffe went home in a
rage
  on the following day he called on myra
full of his grievances she listened to the
recital smoking contemptuously and blow-
ing smoke rings upward
   you fool she said with her customary
frankness  if i was a man id have won
the girl long ago	 i
   thats all very well muttered sutliffe
 youre in her confidence you know
where you stand
    well i repeat it all to you dont i  
   i dont know if you do or not he
muttered
  myra ignored this
   she was here yesterday she said calm-
ly  we discussed you thoroughly 
   what about it
a new girl in town

    shes ready to be crazy about you
 drawled myra blowing a ring
   he jumped up excitedly
    i always though so then its all
 right 
   to tease him myra added casually  she
 also mentioned that you hadnt said any-
 thing about marriage yet
   marriage cried sutliffe with a loud
 laugh  what does she think i am
    she thinks youre a passionate devil
 shes thrilled to pieces
    well thats all right thats all i
 want to-night i wont let her stall me
 off ill-
   youll probably get your face
 scratched drawled myra
   what do you mean he demanded
 scowling  if shes crazy about me-
    my dear friend that caveman stuff only
 gets over on the stage remember there
 were cavewomen too
    well what do you want me to do
    use your wits this girl is as ready to
 drop from the tree as a mellow peach only
 needs a little shake shes full of curiosity
 about you shes thrilled whenever you
 come near her but its your roughness
 puts her off you scowl at her like a pirate
 what youve got to do is to beguile her
 make love to her third act stuff in a gar-
 den with a blue spot go down on your
 marrow bones if necessary make your
 voice flutelike pull out the tremolo stop
 act romeo lord what fools women are
 never can get enough of it and men
 worse fools not to see it
    theres something in what you say
 sutliffe muttered frowning
   myra went off into a peal of derisive
 laughter
   one evening the colonel said to diantha
  i hope you wont be troubled with that
 young blackguard much longer
   diantha looked up in surprise
    when we do get rid of him well begin
 really to enjoy ourselves-palm beach
 cuba europe next summer what would
 you say to a yacht
 somehow the idea of leaving new york
 aroused no enthusiasm in dianthas breast
  but i like something to do she ob-
 jected she presently went on frowning
 a little  do you mean to say you are
 going to catch sutliffe without my help
 she had sacrificed a lot in this game and
 it was galling to think she wasnt even neces-
 sary to its success
    i have to have all sorts of lines out
my dear said the colonel  at the mo-
ment it looks as if one of them was going
to hook the fish but ill need your help
in landing him
   diantha was silent she waited for fur-
ther information
   the colonel proceeded  i have learned
that sutliffe keeps the letters we are after
in the adams trust companys safe deposit
vaults he has a small box there the sort
that rents for ten dollars a year one day
we relieved sutliffe of the keys for an hour
or two without his knowledge and had du-
plicates made then an agent of mine hired
another box in the vault and commenced
visiting it regularly in the course of time
he became friendly with one of the attend-
ants here we had a stroke of luck for
these fellows are mostly incorruptible but
my agent was able to work on the attend-
ants feelings by telling him without men-
tioning names that sutliffe was blackmail-
ing a woman by means of certain letters
which he kept in his box there my agent
has finally brought the attendant to a point
where the man is willing to help him rob
sutliffes box of the letters provided nothing
else is touched
   how would you need me asked di-
antha
   ill tell you the attendant doesnt
want to lose his job naturally and he
makes it a condition that we keep sutliffe
occupied outside while the trick is being
turned thats your job it must be done
some day between two and three oclock
for at that hour the other attendant is out
to lunch and our man is alone in the vault
except for a negro maid she attends to
the booths where the customers clip their
coupons if she did see the attendant hand
sutliffes box to my man she wouldnt know
the difference
    wtiat day asked diantha
   any day you set my dear but give
me sufficient warning

argosy-allstory weekly
  diantha told myra the colonel was be-
coming jealous
   i suppose its natural she murmured
 quite natural said myra dryly
i what are you going to do
   nothing said diantha with a sigh  i
couldnt risk making him really angry
   you can meet sutliffe here if you like
myra suggested casually
  diantha shook her head she could not
appear too eager bad enough to lie on
my own account she said  i wont drag
you into it besides i couldnt let sutliffe
think that i had got you to do it for me
it would undermine my defenses
   i thought you wanted them under-
mined
   i dont want him to know they are
  myra laughed
   suppose i give a party naturally i
would ask you both you meet here by
accident
  diantha shook her head  its very diffi-
cult for me to get away in the evening
    at the dansant then four till seven
   we ride every afternoon said diantha
 indeed the only time i could get off this
week would be some day when he stays
down town to lunch
   what day asked myra
   well thursday i know hes not going
to be home
   ill give a dejeuner dansant said
myra  it will be something new
chapter xx
the dejeuner dansant
the principal room in myras apart-
ment was forty feet long ample in size
for the select party that she planned
it was a gold room the rounded patterned
ceiling was lavishly incrusted with gold leaf
the walls shimmered in various tones of gold
and brown the furniture was upholstered
in gold thread brocades it made a gor-
geous background for myra in black
  for the party she had chosen to appear
as night in a wonderful abbreviated fash-
ioning of black lace there was no touch
of color about her except her violently
rouged cheeks her only ornament was an
astonishing crescent of diamonds bound to
her brow by a black velvet ribbon
  the glass doors into the parrot room were
thrown open and the orchestra a dozen
sleek darkies in miraculously fitting evening
clothes was installed in there beyond the
parrot room was the purple boudoir this
was filled with palms and ferns to make a
conservatory for the occasion a few twin-
kling colored lights amid the greenery cre-
ated a romantic twilight the curtains of
all the rooms were closely drawn daylight
would have spoiled the scene
  it was a buffet lunch and the guests
moved around at will george bricklym and
oliver judd rambert were there as unat-
tached males who never allowed business to
interfere with their engagements they were
in demand at such functions in the day-
time dansant s at the best produce rather a
scratch lot of men sutliffe was like a king
among them another man was hoeber
dimmick who still went by the tide of
 myras manager though she had retired
from the stage he was rather a decayed
looking youth of forty odd whose manner
became ever more boyish as the hair thinned
on his pate the rest of the men were pro-
fessional tea dancers young comely beauti-
fully dressed all with alert and guarded
eyes they were all equally ready to dance
to talk to listen to make love in either the
worshipful or the masterful style
  the ladies included myras  most inti-
mate friends  of the moment i e those
sufficiently in the know for her to wish to be
seen with them a couple of screen stars the
latest emotional actress a society woman or
two who had achieved notoriety through
marital exploits there were also several
ladies  asked out of kindness my dear
who nervously effaced themselves and acted
as admiring chorus to the glittering prin-
cipals there are always some of these at
such a gathering
  after the party had started to myras
great annoyance henry cheeseman turned
up that morning myra had suggested the
propriety of his staying away
   nobody will be here that you care
about and he had appeared to agree
    thats all right my dear i have to run
over to philadelphia
a new girl in town

  vet here he was in a braided cutaway
with a carnation in his buttonhole the
fact was that henry a captain of finance
down town and a worm at home was learn-
ing to use the underground tactics of the
worm
   he was careful to approach his wife for
the first time at a moment when there were
others around her her glance upon him
was not friendly
    i thought you were in philadelphia
henry smiled painfully  i was fortu-
nately able to close the deal by telephone
my dear somehow his wall street man-
ner never seemed to go down at home
    how nice for all of us said myra cut-
tingly  now that youre here look after
the orchestra will you give them a drink
once in a while to jazz them up but not
enough to make them fresh
  as he walked unhappily away myra said
languidly to the man she was with quite
loud enough for henry to hear  husbands
are so naif poor dears 
  during most of the afternoon henry
stood about in the corners of his own rooms
piteously inviting somebody to take notice
of him like a waiter on a commision basis
when business is poor but they rarely
did when his load of self-consciousness
became too great to be borne he went to
another comer and took a fresh pose
   once he screwed up his courage sufficient-
ly to ask myra to dance he was turned
down his eyes followed her around fur-
tively and wistfully she affected to take no
notice of it but it made her furious she
got him alone finally
    do you think youre adding to the suc-
cess of my party by standing round look-
ing like a fool she demanded  either
act as if you belonged or go to your own
room and play solitaire
   henry in desperation attached himself
to mrs pryor one of the faded anxious
ladies who was earning her tea by the fer-
vent admiration of everybody present she
was delighted to be noticed by a millionaire
and the rest of the time they sat on a sofa
in the gold room making believe to have a
perfectly delicious time
  diantha timed her arrival for a moment
after the party had got under way myra
prepared the minds of the other ladies for
her
  my dear ive got a novelty to spring
 later
  whats that myra
  a little girl from the country the real
 thing baby blue eyes peachy complexion
 innocent and frolicsome as a heifer calf
  go on myra where did you pick her
 up
  its diantha lore colonel flower-
 days ward  ward  was always spoken
 and received with a snigger
  you dont say im crazy to meet her
 he keeps her pretty close she cant really
 be as virginal as all that
  you shall see for yourself directly
  its a good pose though its about
 due positively everybody has become so
 cynical you simply cant go any farther in
 that direction
  i thought it would be a good joke said
 myra  if we all played up to her this
 afternoon you know cut out the vamping
 while shes here and the jazzy conversa-
 tion
  great
  of course if shes going round with us
 regularly we couldnt keep it up but lets
 break her in gradually
  you can depend upon me dear ill
 be as demure as a quaker
 with the men diantha took a slightly
 different tone  ive got a treat for you
 boys this afternoon a real old-fashioned
 girl
  whats the gag myra
  on the level this little girl has never
 seen life and you mustnt make her cry
 its diantha lore
 the gentleman laughed here
  hasnt the colonel showed her life
  no shes reformed him
  well she can reform me too if she
 wants
  thats up to her meanwhile youve
 got to behave if you try anything on her
 ill turn you all out as long as shes here
 the eighteenth amendment is goihg to be
 enforced bars closed till after she runs
 home to poppa
 all this talk created for diantha what
 actors call a good entrance when she a-
argosy-allstory weekly
 ptared in tbe doorway to the gcm room
 myra signaled to tbe oidicsln to step
 every pair of eyes in tbe room turned to tbe
 newcomer full of curiosity
   diantha was wearing ar ejc-fashioned
 cress of lettuce-green taffeta crisp as iettuee
 leaves tbe prim tight-fitting bodice came
 tc a point in front and was finished with
 two little tabs behind under it billowed a
 full plain skirt she wore no jewels tbe
 square of csh revealed at her neck was of
 a still mace delicious texture than tke
 taffeta tbe pale green silk cast a delicate
 opalescence upon it thrrmgh which vbe hue
 of health gleamed faintly
   tbe comical little dress and that air of
 piaaihas of an eager child pausing at tbe
 threshold established tbe character that
 myra had already given her excepting tbe
 two who knew diantha there was net a
 soul in tbe room but who believed that bar
 girlish and unaffected air was  carefully
 contrived effect
   myra swam toward her and the guests
 followed in myras train diantba was a
 little alarmed a having the whole party stop
 at her entrance to have every oce crowd-
 ing around clamoring tor an introduction
 confused her it was the first time she had
 been tbe star attraction at a party tbe
 glittering ladies were even more cordial than
 tbe men but diantba perceived the sneer
 in their artificially brightened eyes
   tbe men did not sneer their eyes how-
 ever bleary  lighted up at tbe sight of her
 tbey contended for dances diantha road
 to dance to that perfect music chose the
 likeliest partner and flung promises to tbe
 others over her shoulder she lose herself
   sutliffe disdaining to make oce of a
 crowd of suitors beid off for tbe time being
 diantha merely making sure that be was
 present affected not to notice bim tbe
 general and miscellaneous admiration she
 was receiving made sutliffe a little annoyed
 it introduced a new element into tbe situa-
 tion-an element that would scarcely work
 to bis advantage suppose diantbas head
 got turned by it he began to doubt tbe
 wisdom of this party
   sutliffe in his masterful way presently
 broke in on diantha and ber partner in
 the double game they were playing each
bad to make believe to be surprised at find-
ing the other there dianthas partner
only  dancing man a hard glance from
sutliffes blue eves quelled him he yielded
up bis treasure without question diantba
nestled comfortably within sutliffes arm
a changed quality in ber smile admitted
him to a different footing from any of e
others sutliffe felt better
   he bethought himself of myras advice
    what a surprise to find you here be
murmured in ber ear  i was looking for-
ward to an afternoon of unmitigated bore-
dom
   diantha would not lie unless she had to
so she merely said teasindy - what d
you come for then
    just to oblige myra men are hard to
collect for these affairs
   myra she said  do you know ber
as well as that
  he hastened to repair tbe mistake
 xo its a rotten habit one gets into you
were right to call me down where did you
meet mrs cheeseman
    cant talk murmured diantha  this
is too heavenly
  later he whispered  how lovely you
are this afternoon
  there was mockery in her smile up at
him but pleasure too
    you make all these other women seem
ike painted dohsi be went on
    they do put it on pretty thick dont
tbey i suppose its the custom very like-
ly  come to it
  xo xo be said you are my
dream of goodness and purity dont de-
prive me of that
   she held herself a little away from him
and looked into bis face with surprise and
merriment
    why kirwan dont you fee well 
    dont tease im in earnest
   diantha was pleased by this change of
mood she could handle him better she
lost no time in playing up to it  you
never showed me this side of you she mur-
mured
   i suppose you thought i was a kind
of animal he said bitterly
    xot fcat exactly kirwan but--veil
practical
a new girl ix town

  i m sorry for the way i acted lots of sutliffe was by the door  oh she just
 times you swept me off my feet ill try gave the order to a florist  he said
to do better hereafter
  her fingers curled warmly around the
hand that held hers  kirwan youre verv
  
nice this way she murmured
   he drew her closer to him she did not
resist his heart beat heavily and he felt
the pressure of his blood in his neck veins
  easy easy he warned himself
youll have to keep up the mushy line for a
while yet
   when other men tried to break sutliffe
calmly swept diantha out of their reach
  when the music stopped they strolled
into the temporary conservatory myra
whose apparently indifferent eyes missed
nothing saw them go and sent her hus-
band to tell the musicians they might take
fifteen minutes intermission
   in the conservatory was a door leading
into a little room-a dressing room ordi-
narily-which had for the afternoon been
converted into titanias bower myra had
shown it to sutliffe in the interim the
door being closed none of the other dancers
had discovered it sutliffe now opened the
door and lifted a light curtain that hung
within
   how lovely exclaimed diantha  a
dolls fairyland
    just for us  murmured sutliffe
   how did you know about it she
asked
   saw a couple come out a while ago
he answered glibly  i closed the door so
nobody else would find it until we were
through dancing
  the walls were hung all round with a
dark blue material simulating night high
up in one comer was a baby spotlight i e
the moon casting down its beams on a
thread of water which rose from a tiny foun-
tain in the middle of the bower the in-
tended effect wa of a comer of an old for-
mal garden a hedge of growing boxwood
was ranged about and facing the fountain
was a curiously wrought bench heaped with
cushions
   diantha sank on the cushions taking it
all in
   what a lot of trouble for myra to
take
     he closed the door and the curtain of
 blue stuff fell in place
      leave it open diantha said quickly
      it spoils everything he grumbled
      please kirwan
      cant you trust me
    diantha got up its not that in
 somebody elses house like this oh dont
 you see
     people will be breaking in on us he
 said sullenly
 she stamped her foot in a little burst of
 irritation
  foolish man its you who spoil
 everything dont you see that i can be
 lots nicer to you if the doors open
 he opened the door with an ill grace
 as he came and sat beside her diantha
 touched his hand  dont be cross she
 pleaded  show me that nice self of
 yours
 it was a difficult role for him to play
 but he had seen how like a charm it worked
 he struggled with himself  i thought
 he muttered  after that dance together-
  but how could we-here asked di-
 antha with seeming frankness  well have
 to go bacft in a minute or two i cant put
 on a mask like these new york women
 i d give everything away in my face
  its always some other place some other
 time he complained  when can i see
 you im not asked to the house any more
  i know said diantha  the colonel-
  it drives me wild muttered sutliffe
  to think of you there-with him
 diantha opened her eyes  but why
 kirwan thought  lord does she in-
 sist on keeping up that pretense he
 adroitly changed his line  and all these
 men here privileged to put their arms
 around you
  silly you know i love dancing but
 there isnt a man here id look twice at
 the old ones-are old the young ones-
 dont seem quite real dancing manikins
  i hate to see a mans hand profane
 you he murmured  youre so sweet so
 wonderful 
 a dimple came in dianthas cheek she
 looked down at her fingers

  sutliffe caught one of her hands and
pressed it to his lips
   i adore you he murmured
   oh kinvan- the situation was de-
veloping too fast for diantha she had to
keep it going for more than half an hour
yet  tell me something about yourself
she said quickly  do you know i know
nothing about you what do you do
   nothing useful he said carelessly
 my dad left me too much money
  diantha smiled to herself sudiffes
father had been a bookkeeper in a chicago
bank
    but since ive known you ive become
disgusted with my idle life he went on
   then why not change it
   dont know how to begin by myself
if i had an inspiration like you in my life
i	could do things inwardly he was full
of sardonic laughter  this is the stuff
they fall for he thought
    this is your better self said diantha
softly  why do you make believe to be
scornful and self-satisfied
    i shant with you he said humbly
   and so the game went on
   but she was too lovely too appealing
he could not hold himself in for long his
arm crept around her waist she put it
away from her  he put it back
    what time is it kirwan she asked
nervously
  he laughed  you funny child what
difference does it make
   no but i want to know
   he indulgently drew out his watch an ex-
pensive repeater when he pressed a spring
a delicate little bell tinkled inside two
strokes a pause then three more  two
forty-five he said
    fifteen minutes thought diantha
meanwhile the arm was ever drawing her
closer and his hot breath was in her neck
 diantha kiss me he whispered
    kirwan please lets talk about your
plans
   -	not now-kiss me diantha 
  she jumped up  will you force me to
leave the room
   by way of answer he glided to the door
and closed it and put his back against it
he stood glowering at her  how long do
you think youre going to keep this up-
playing with me ive had enough were
going to have a showdown right now
  diantha was least afraid of him when
he was in a rage her chin went up
    all right she said  lets-have a show-
down do you think you can ever force roe
to do something i dont choose to do
   there was a silent battle between their
eyes diantha won because he was terrified
of losing her and she had nothing to lose
when she saw his eyes waver and fall she
made her voice kind again
    come and sit down you neednt open
the door
   thus a crisis was passed diantha knew
that her victory could be but a momentary
one passion overcame the man in suc-
cessive waves each a little higher than the
last
   for a while they talked about sutliffes
mythical business plans he had a hard
time keeping his mind fixed on it his eyes
were glazed and irresponsible
   if you would take me you could do
what you wanted with me he murmured
   diantha snatched at any chance to pro-
long the discussion  are you asking me
to mam- you she murmured demurely
   it took him sharply aback he looked at
her with an extraordinary expression half
a snarl
    would you if i did he muttered
    i dont know you havent she said
   by god youre a hardy woman
   you have called me pretty nearly every-
thing by now laughed diantha
    do you consider yourself fit to marry
me he snarled
   it did not anger her time was passing
 how- can i say she countered  i don t
know how bad you are
    bad enough to love you to distraction
   his arm went around her again
    be careful
   he took the cajoling line
    diantha be a little sweet to me  i
want you so let me put my cheek against
yours see im not going to bite you
turn your head a little sweetheart jusi
two inches and our lips will meet-
    what time is it asked diantha
  he dropped her with an oath damn
                           	a
a new girl in town

   diantha swallowed her laughter  let
me hear that dear little bell ring again
  he sullenly obeyed her the watch
struck three times and stopped three
oclock dianthas breast was flooded with

relief she could go now
   he sought to pick up the tender note just
 where it had been dropped the arm again
  diantha your lips
   she stood up  ive got to go now
   he jumped up scowling at her he did
not think she meant it but she walked
coolly to the door and opened it he was
after her with a bound but by that time
she was outside there were others in the
purple room and he could make no demon-
stration there diantha walked coolly
across the room and down the corridor with
the scowling sutiiffe at her shoulder when
she disappeared into the ladies dressing
room he was obliged to wait outside the
door
   diana asked myras maid for her coat
 is there another way out of this room
she inquired
   this maid was not the smiling fanny but
 an experienced gallic damsel who took life
 as it came  oui mademoiselle through
 the bathroom and down the service passage
 to the maids rooms
    and can i get out of the building with-
 out being seen
    certainement the service elevator
if mademoiselle will condescend-
   the transfer of a bill from diantha to
lizette facilitated the formers escape
   sutliffe was still waiting outside the other
 door
   diantha found the colonel already at
home  the letters she asked eagerly
 have we got them
   he shrugged good-humoredly  a com-
plete fizzle my dear
   oh-h  said diantha what hap-
pened
   have you ever been in a safety deposit
vault
   she shook her head
    well its lined all around with hun-
dreds of little steel safes each of these
afes requires two keys to open it a master
key which is in the hands of the attendant
  	a
and the individual key which the customer
holds inside the safe is a lofcked steel box
to which the customer holds the only key
well when the outer safe was locked and
the box pulled out it was discovered that
sutliffe had had the wit to seal it with wax
the vault attendant would not allow my
man to break the seal it would have cost
him his job you see so were just where
we started
   dianthas heart sunk she had had about
enough of sutliffe now her curiosity was
amply satisfied
    youre home early said the colonel
   oh the party was beginning to get
rough said diantha carelessly
    anything unpleasant occur he asked
with a shade of anxiety
    no indeed 
 sutliffe not getting beyond you
diantha lied stoutiy  on the contrary
im learning better how to handle him
good said colonel flowerday
 then well start a new line
chapter xxi
kittson
randal was not very sucessful in for-
getting diantha it caused nancy
guyon the sharpest pain to see the
light go out of her boys eyes and the old
sunken dogged look return she guessed of
course that something had happened to de-
stroy his faith in diantha but had no means
of knowing what it was randal whose de-
termination to thrash sutliffe had not
abated still kept up his training only he
never ran past the colonels house any more
he set his course in the other direction
halfway round the park and back
   soon he and nancy resumed their after-
noon walks though not in the same comfort-
able intimacy as heretofore his terror
iat she might reopen the subject of di-
antha was so obvious that nancy leaned
over backward in her desire to avoid it
gradually randal became more at ease with
his mother though he was still pricked by
the feeling that after all he had told her
in the beginning he owed her some sort of
explanation now

argosy-allstory weekly
   finally it came out one afternoon very
 hurriedly and lamely  nancy the reason 
 never talk about-what we used to talk
 about is because im cured-absolutely
 cured
    yes dear she said lowering her head
 to hide the springing tears it was so ob-
 vious that he was not cured she could
 not forbear one question  is it because
 you found you were mistaken in her ran
  no no he said violently but
my hands are tied
   though he had given up all hope he
 brooded on diantha constantly such un-
 selfish brooding gives one in time a cer-
 tain clairvoyance in respect to the object
 randal guessed that it was sutliffe who had
 set myra upon diantha in pursuit of this
 idea he looked up some mutual acquaint-
 ances and made cautious inquiries george
 bricklym told him of the party at myras
 the fact of the party confirmed randals
 suspicions he smelled a conspiracy it
 maddened him he felt so powerless to act
   one day he was on his way to oddies
 rooms when he met sutliffe coming out of
 the house the two young men passed
 without any sign of recognition getting
 out of the elevator randal yielded to an
 impulse instead of going to oddies door
 he rang sutliffes bell across the landing
   kittson opened the door the waxen
 impassive face broke up in pleasure at the
 sight of randal
    mr randal you this is a surprise
 but you dont look real well sir will you
 come in
   randal shook his head  i want to talk
 to you kittson but not here will you
 come across to mr oddies flat for a min-
 ute
     yes sir certainlv sir
     wtieres sutliffe
    gone for the afternoon sir
   kittson followed randal across the land-
 ing randal had a key to oddies apart-
 ment oddie was away randal led the
 way into the little book-lined den where a
 faint pleasant reek of tobacco still hung
 on the air face to face with kittson re-
 spectfully awaiting his communication ran-
 dals tongue clave to the roof of his mouth
 and words deserted him honest fellow
 though kittson was it seemed impossible to
 open so intimate a matter to a servant
  kittson seeing his distress helped him
 out
   mr oddie is a reader i see he re-
 marked glancing around at the books
  randal was grateful for the respite
  yes how are hydrostatics getting along
kittson
   slowly sir its an abstruse subject
 excellent training for the mind
   what are you going to do with it
    scarcely know sir the great thing
 is the mental training you didnt read
 that book i gave you sir
   no said randal contritely  could
 not put my mind to it in the excitement i
 left it behind
   you would find it an excellent sedative
 sir
   just what i need eh
   will you try it again if i send it to
 you sir
   yes and thank you kittson once
 randals mind was taken off the subject
 which oppressed it the words began to come
 of their own accord  kittson i havent
 forgotten what you and i said to each other
 the night i left
   thank you sir there isnt a day but
 what i have thought of it too and wished
 there was something i could do to help
 you
   what made you think i needed help
 the queasy randal demanded
   i could see something was troubling
 you sir
 well-ive come to you for help now
kittson
  kittsons old face worked with emotion
 and pleasure
   oh mr randal anything any-
 thing
  randal blurted out  the real cause of
 the quarrel between sutliffe and me was a
 young lady
   yes sir
   how did you know that cried randal
 sharply  did you overhear anything
   no sir but it always is isnt it
 young men-
   but this is quite different kittson
 randal said eagerly i want you to be
a new girl in town

 sure to get it right this is a good girl-
 a lady very young
    i knew it was a serious matter sir
 shes in bad hands cried randal
 quite forgetting himself at last  thats
 what drives me wild to think of her name
 is diantha lore did you ever hear that
 name mentioned
    not that i can recall sir
    i want you to remember it
    i shall never forget it now sir
    and i dont want you to get any idea
 into your head that this is a case of jealousy
 between sutliffe and me whatever may
 happen theres nothing in it for me the
 young lady doesnt care for me never
 will i believe sutliffe is plotting to do
 her harm have you ever seen anything
 or heard anything in there that would bear
 that out think hard
   kittson slowly shook his head
    i believe theres a mrs cheeseman
 mixed up in it too randal went on
 has she ever been to sutliffes flat
   not while i was there sir sometimes
 he sends me out when hes expecting a visi-
 tor
    does he talk to her over the tele-
 phone
    i dont know sir dont always hear
 the names of the parties he talks to
    her given name is myra said randal
 kittsons face lighted up  oh yes sir
 he often talks to a lady called myra
    what do they say to each other de-
 manded randal eagerly  have you ever
 heard anything that would suggest a plot-
 harm to another woman
    no sir hes very guarded on his talk
 over the phone the boys downstairs listen
 you see this myra called him up just
 before he went out to-day
    what did you hear
   kittson shook his head  nothing of
 any account sir the other party did most
 of the talking all i could gather was that
 something they were bothered about was all
 right he was in a rare good humor when
 he went out
 -	that means everything is all wrong for
 us said randal bitterly
  i took it that he went up to her place
 to talk things over said kittson  ill
watch and listen more careful in the future
   sir
    yes said randal  thats what i
  wanted to ask of you under other circum-
  stances id never think of asking you to go
  against your boss but this is serious and
  im not asking anything for myself only
  for her where the safety of a young girl
  is concerned were justified in doing any-
  thing
     dont you worry about that sir said
 kittson grimly  i earn my wages good-
 with what and all i have to put up with
 apart from that i owe him nothing ill
 go through his letters
   no cried randal in horror i
couldnt have you do that there wouldnt
be anything in writing anyhow i forbid
you to touch his letters 
     very well sir said kittson with a de-
 mure air that suggested he would use his
 own discretion in obeying
chapter xxii
the counterplot
myra was not a little bothered by di-
anthas abrupt departure from her
party sutliffe disappeared at about
the same time and she had no opportunity
of obtaining an explanation from him she
did not call diantha up on the telephone
on the whole it seemed safest to call for
diantha at the usual hour next morning
just as if nothing had happened
  naturally diantha whatever her private
feelings had to receive her with undimin-
ished friendliness myra was secretly re-
lieved it appeared from dianthas ex-
planations that sutliffe had been a little
too ardent the day before but no serious
harm had been done diantha was pre-
pared to receive myras excuses for the
enamored young man with an indulgent
air
   the whole miserable party was a fias-
co said myra self-accusingly i was
almost afraid to come here this morning
   how silly said diantha  it wasnt
your fault
   im afraid youll never be willing to
come to my house again hinted myra

argosy-allstory weekly
    why of course i will said diantha
    you dear said myra  but no more
 parties one cant control a party when
 the men bring their own- will you come to
 dinner at my house some night just you
 and sutliffe henry and i
    love to said diantha  some night
 when the colonels dining out
    set your own time my dear and ill
 arrange it
    ill let you know said diantha
   that afternoon myra summoned sutliffe
 to her apartment and gave him a piece of
 her mind  do you want to spoil every-
 thing
   but sutliffe was sullen  you may have
 been right in the beginning he said  but
 its gone too far now this girl is prepared
 to string me along indefinitely im going
 to show her now ive had enough of her
 high and mighty attitude i mean to break
 it down just give me the chance thats all
 its ridiculous to pay court to old man
 flowerdays mistress as if she were a virtu-
 ous woman only iwells her head 
    she may not be his mistress mur-
 mured myra
    ah tell that to the marines
   myra loved intrigue for its own sake and
 had any amount of patience in weaving her
 plots but she saw that in sutliffe she had
 a recalcitrant weapon she must use him as
 she could
    all right she said with a shrug  ill
 give you your chance the rest is up to
 you
    when he asked eagerly
    the night she comes here to dinner
    here
   xo you fool what do you think i
 am afterward in your own place
 sutliffes eyes glittered
   xext time she saw diantha myra casual-
 ly referred to the dinner again  we might
 go to the theater afterward and sutliffe
 is crazy to have us come around and see his
 rooms i suppose it would be all right so
 long as you have an old married woman like
 me along
   surely said diantha id love to
 see his place if only the colonel stays out
 long enough
   oh well lets wait until some night
when we know hes going to be safely out of
the way
   at luncheon diantha remarked to the col-
onel  myra and sutliffe are now planning
to entice me to sutliffes rooms some night
quite like a melodrama isnt it
  ha cried the colonel with interest
 we could turn that to our advantage
you wouldnt be afraid to go would you
provided i took ample measures for your
safety
    certainly not said diantha stoutly
    what night he asked
   thats for you to say its supposed
to be the first night when youre going to
be out
   good that will give me time to pre-
pare let me see the woman will be hor-
ribly in the way-
   oh i fancy well lose myra some-
where said diantha dryly i the whole
thing smells of a conspiracy
    of course  said the colonel  let me
think i ought to have at least a week
xext friday night-that is a week from
to-morrow theres a banquet of the latin-
america association at the madagascar
tell them im going to that tell them it
will be an all-night affair
   diantha nodded  but you said the let-
ters werent in sutliffes rooms
  ill have them there that night my
dear
   colonel flowerday now desired to talk to
mrs guyon again for obvious reasons he
could not write to her and to call her upon
the telephone was no less dangerous since
mrs guyon talked through a switchboard
in the guyon house and servants were
bound to listen in the colonel looked up
the society column in the times and found
his opportunity in a ball of the knicker-
bocker society to be given at the plaza that
night mrs guyon was named among the
patronesses she would certainly be present
   for several years colonel flowerday had
not cared to move in the exquisite circle that
mrs guyon adorned but he had friends
and connections-not always acknowledged
-in every circle and it was not at all diffi-
cult for him to obtain an invitation to even
so exclusive an affair as the knickerbocker
a new girl in town

  dance as diantha was going to bed that
  night he set off for it magnificent as ever
  in his evening dress
    he was not much impressed by the  bril-
  liance  of the occasion an old story to
  him after all less exclusive parties were
  more amusing there were plenty of gay
  young people present but there was also
  a line of hang-overs from the previous gen-
  eration who constituted themselves censors
  and only succeeded in being wet blankets
    having satisfied himself that mrs guyon
  was present and letting her see him the
  colonel quietly bided his time sutliffe was
  present and it would hardly have been safe
  for him to ask nancy to dance or to be
  seen talking with her apart
    his chance came when he saw her danc-
 ing with forbes bostwick a much-run-after
 man in that set the colonel picked up a
 neglected former beauty a mrs carmody
 and sat out with her meanwhile covertly
 following the other couple with his eyes
 the colonel never danced when he saw
 nancy and her partner turn into the long
 corridor at the rear of the ballroom he sug-
 gested to mrs carmody that they take a
 stroll
    the two couples came face to face in a
 verdant alley all four were acquainted
 and they fell into light talk other couples
 passed them continually nancy was ex-
 quisite in white messaline and silver lace
 she saw in the colonels eye that this was
 no accidental meeting and helped him out
 mrs carmody too charmed to have an op-
 portunity of talking to forbes bostwick
 helped him out too unwittingly in a mo-
 ment or two the quartet had divided into
 two couples in another moment or two
 a yard or so separated them
  since mrs carmody had lowered her
voice it was perfectly natural for the colonel
to do so too
    nancy he murmured out of a smiling
maskjike face  i want you to enter into ne-
gotiations with sutliffes lawyer to buy those
letters
  she too had on her politely smiling
mask  but you know i have tried that
crispin he asks a preposterous price
     know i dont want you to buy them
but only to negotiate ask him to make an
   offer then make a counter offer spin it
   along for a few days next thursday-
   mark this well-write and accept whatever
   his latest offer may be and appoint satur-
   day morning for a meeting
       i understand she said laughing deli-
   cately as at a jest
      listen hard you must stipulate that
   sutliffe personally is to hand over the let-
   ters to you and receive securities in return
   and you must appoint the hour of eight
   thirty on saturday morning for the meeting
   give any reason you like for this hour
     she nodded gayly
     i- it doesnt make any difference where
   you appoint the meeting to take place for i
   dont want you to go there nor unless my
   plans miscarry will sutliffe be there either
   you understand
       perfectly
       thats all then very enjoyoble affair
   isnt it
     mrs guyon stole a lightning glance at
   the other couple the flirtatious mrs car-
   mody still held bostwick deep in whispered
   converse
      oh crispin she murmured  i do so
   want to have a real talk with you i sup-
   pose it isnt safe
   he shook his head
    sutliffe is here doubtless watching
   you we mustnt start him thinking
    i wanted to ask you about this girl
   diantha lore
    what have you heard about her he
   asked sharply
    oh-what every one hears is she-is
   she like the last one you had working for
   you
    good god no he said startled  i
 never thought youd believe such talk shes
 a girl in a thousand nancy a girl after
 your own heart 
   they say-they say she murmured
  breathlessly  that you have become very
  much attached to her
    ah that much is true anyway said
 the colonel beaming  though not perhaps
 in the way they think i adore her nancy
 she has changed the whole color of my
 life
  mrs guyon lowered her lashes her
 smile was unchanged a dull grinding pain

 gripped her breast my poor randal
 she thought  i cannot help you
   the music started again
    heres the next dance cried mrs car-
 mody vivaciously  do take me back col-
 onel i have it with the most fascinating
 creature
   a day or two later diantha called up
 myra she said  oh myra dear ive
 just learned that the colonel is going to at-
 tend the latin-america banquet on friday
 night
    fine darling did you ask him what
 time he would be home
   said he was going to make a night
 of it
    splendid
    are you sure friday night will suit
 you myra
    absolutely love ill call up sutliffe
 at once
   she did and in a quarter of an hour he
 was in her apartment they congratulated
 each other
    like the direct interposition of provi-
 dence said myra
    or the devil suggested sutliffe in a
 high good humor
   for an hour in the parrot room they had
 their heads together better than anything
 else in the world myra loved plotting her
 situations in advance so clever was she
 and so heedless most other people that she
 was generally successful in bringing things
 around the way she wanted she now went
 into the minutest detail what she was to
 say what sutliffe was to say how they
 were to act in every contingency sutliffe
 with a mans impatience chafed at these
 elaborate arrangements but with myra it
 had to be all or nothing either he had to
 submit to her in every particular or she
 washed her hands of the whole affair
   as sutliffe rose to go he said  ill get
 the theater tickets
  if you want more time pick out a
 stupid show and well leave in the middle
 said myra
 on friday evening when diantha was
 dressed ready to start for myras the col-
 onel came and gave her final instructions
   nervous dear he asked
   not at all  said diantha quickly not
for worlds would she have confessed how
her breast was fluttering
  he took a small automatic from his
pocket
   you ought to carry this how can you
conceal it he asked with an anxious glance
at her tight bodice
   i prepared for it said diantha coolly
 slit a seam in the back of my skirt and
put in a pocket
   just where a man carries his said the
colonel smiling
   it  be darned uncomfortable if i hap-
pen to sit on it said diantha
   ever fire a pistol he asked
  she shook her head  better unload it
anyway she said  i wouldnt want to
shoot him really it will be enough just
to produce it you will be near anyway
the colonel nodded and emptied the
shells into his hand diantha slipped the
weapon into her pocket
   everything has gone all right so far
said the colonel  mrs guyon made an
appointment with sutliffe for eight thirty-
to-morrow morning consequently he had
to get the letters out before closing time this
afternoon to-night when you visit him
they will either be upon his person or con-
cealed somewhere in the apartment your
job of course is to find out where the let-
ters are and if possible to get your hands
on them
   sutliffes apartment has a whole line of
windows opening on the side street he
went on  i and some of my men will be
watching those windows from across the
street if you need help you are to throw
up one of the windows a forcible entry
by us would make a lot of unpleasant pub-
licity of course but you mustnt take any
unnecessary- risks if you cant get the win-
dow up break the glass
  diantha asked  has mrs guyon ever
described the letters
   yes there are ten letters they are
all written on the same heavy roughish
papers robins egg blue in color prob-
ably somewhat yellowed by age when the
sheets are folded once across they are al-
most square cant say whether they are
a new girl ix town

still in their original envelopes if so the
envelopes are addressed to mr boardman
ware at the chronos club
   where would a man carry letters on his
person
  the colonel illustrated the inside breast
pocket
   i think i have everything straight now
said diantha
   one thing i have not mentioned be-
fore said the colonel  ive arranged to
have a man trail your party all evening
if theres any departure from the original
plan proposed by myra ill quickly be in-
formed of it
  myra welcomed diantha with many apol-
ogies for the absence of henry  the poor
fellow had a dinner and conference at his
club that he couldnt possibly get out of
he was brokenhearted i asked dimmock
to fill in hes pleasantly harmless
  diantha was not at all surprised at the
suppression of henry henry might be
feeble but he would not stand for such
work as had been planned for this night
  diantha and sutliffe had no moment
alone before dinner that was part of
myras arrangements
  	mustnt risk a premature climax she
had said to sutliffe l wait till the stage
is all set
   the dinner was not a very brilliant affair
all of them had the sense of something im-
pending that didnt feaze myra at all
but it was never part of myras role to
exert herself to be entertaining she lan-
guidly left that to others sutliffe was ner-
vous over-trained for the affair maybe
and diantha was oppressed by all sorts of
feelings the major part of the talk thus
fell to dimmock who kept up an agree-
able noise without saying anything in par-
ticular the passe youth was neither hand-
some nor clever but he had one inestimable
virtue like the chameleon he instantly took
the color of his surroundings and his only
aim was to please myra found him very
useful he would take anything from her
  they had no time to linger over the coffee
cups the green landaulet carried them to
the theater myra and diantha sat on the
back seat the two men sitting forward
  sutliffe proved to have been not unsuc-
cessful in his search for a stupid play it
was the drama of a hot-headed juvenile-
middle-aged-who quarreled with his papa
-obviously younger than he-and went out
west to buck bronchos or something the
first act in which this highly original scheme
was laid out was endless and the second
act in which the high-born heroine sacri-
ficed her pride and went after him to be a
cowgirl threatened to be drearier still the
young man of course was discovered in a
compromising situation with a near-spanish
lady et cetera et cetera the most depress-
ing thing about the performance was the
serious way in which the audience sat and
took it all in
  diantha could get fun out of almost any-
thing once or twice in the beginning a
chuckle escaped her but it rang strangely
in the still theater and she was abashed
thereafter she suffered keenly they dis-
cussed the play among themselves in sarcas-
tic whispers and sutliffe was probably ob-
jurgated for having inflicted it on them
myra become more and more impatient
finally in the middle of the second act she
stood up saying
   im not going to stand it another min-
ute
  they filed out the rest of the audience
looked at them in virtuous disapproval au-
diences are much too polite if they more
frequently exercised their privilege of walk-
ing out theyd get better plays
  outside the chauffeur was instructed to
take them to the little apartment house al-
most opposite the cathedral
  as myra diantha and dimmock entered
the elevator sutliffe hung behind for a mo-
ment to the boy at the telephone he said
in an undertone
li if anybody calls to-night im not in
i dont want to be bothered by the tele-
phone either
   yes sir
   therell be a waiter later let him up
of course but nobody else you under-
stand
   yes sir
  upstairs the bland and waxen kittson
admitted them to the apartment he pre-
ceded them into the living room to turn on

argosy-allstory weekly
the lights kittson did not know who the
guests were until he heard sutliffe say
    nothing gorgeous here like your place
 myra
   kittson sized up that lady in a sharp
veiled glance
   myra said
   oh diantha see these funny little
china monkeys 
   kittson got a shock upon hearing that
name his startled eyes dwelt on the girl
compassionately nobody was looking at
kittson of course his brain began to
work fast
   sutliffe followed the servant out of the
room
    kittson he said  i want you to tele-
 phone gareties to send in a supper for two
 in-say half an hour
    for two sir
   for two i said let me see-iced
bouillon squab en aspic asparagus ices
petits fours get arm and the head waiter
on the phone and tell him who its for
arm and knows
    yes sir
    dont forget this the waiter is to ring
 three times so ih know who it is
    three times sir
    get the coffee machine ready to start
and put a couple of bottles of my  cham-
pagne to ice after you have done that you
can take the night off
    the night off sir
    yes yes said sutliffe impatiently
 dont want to see you again until noon
to-morrow heres a twenty for you
    yes sir thank you sir stammered
kittson
   sutliffe returned to the living room wear-
 ing a picturesque maroon velvet smoking
 jacket he made some light apology about
  wanting to be comfortable the bizarre
 garment was decidedly becoming
  diantha wondered what had become of
the dress coat it had set so smoothly on
his broad chest during dinner she did not
see how any packet of letters could be con-
cealed in the pocket but she wanted to
make sure
   she expressed a desire to see the apart-
 ment and tbey all set off on a tour of in-
 spection in sutliffes bedroom the room
nearest the front door she say the coat
thrown over the back of a chair she man-
aged to brush against it so that it fell to the
floor picking it up and folding it neatly
inside out she laid it back the breast
pocket was empty
   next to sutliffes room was the lining
room then the living room which occupied
the comer of the building the bedroom
once occupied by randal guyon opened off
the living room with a window on the ave-
nue while kitchen pantry servants room
et cetera were on the inside of the building
across the hall that ran from front door to
living room
   back in the living room again diantha
spotted a handsome mahogany cabinet that
served no ostensible purpose
    is this a camouflaged phonograph she
asked lightly  lets have a tune
    thats my strong box said sutliffe
    doesnt look very strong
    wait till you see the inside he took
a little key from the top drawer of his desk
alongside
    is that where you keep the key how
considerate laughed diantha
    oh this key doesnt count
   he opened the wooden door of the cab-
inet and inside was revealed a sphere of
steel sufficient to intimidate the most enter-
prising of burglars into its round face a
door was let in with the usual handle and
combination dial
   there was a spot of color in dianthas
either cheek and her heart was beating fast
could she charm him into opening it
    i saw a play once she said  in which
a crook was supposed to open a safe like
that by turning the knob and listening do
you suppose thats possible
    just a playwrights dream i guess
laughed dimmock
    but how would you get it open if you
lost the combination asked diantha
    you couldnt lose it said sutliffe
   its etched inside your skull like your
own name
   what is a combination anyhow
laughed diantha  its something you re
always hearing about but i dont know
    ill show you said sutliffe dropping
to one knee in front of the safe
a new girl in town

  diantha glanced fearfully at myra
surely myra must see how excited she was
but myra was merely bored and indifferent
dimmock was a foolish light-minded sort of
person he didnt count
  sutliffe twirled the knob of the dial rap-
idly from right to left and back again slow-
ing up between to bring the indicator to a
certain number diantha knew very well
what a combination was the colonel had
instructed her and now quick as sutliffes
movements were her eyes followed them
he started at ten on the dial made two
complete turns to the left and stopped at
thirty three turns to the right stopping at
seventy and a half turn back to twenty
the handle of the safe turned in his hand
he opened the door part-way and swung it
back not so quick though but diantha
had a glimpse of a packet of yellowish-blue
letters on a shelf inside
  sutliffe locked the safe gave the dial a
twirl locked the outer door they talked
gayly of other things but now the com-
bination was etched inside dianthas skull
too
to be concluded next week

the conqueror
cee there he comes
      oh the gay pride of him
youth in the stride of him
      trumpets and drums
        all the street stares
turning to glance at him
soft eyes askance at him
        little he cares
      never a pause
      taking as due to him
      what may accrue to him
       love and applause
      careless and proud-
that is their part of him
       but the deep heart of him
       hid from the crowd
      simple and frank
      traitors be wise of him
       are not the eyes of him
       pledge of his rank
      vigor and tan-
look at the strength of him
oh the good length of him

whex andrew lorimer came back
from town he stood for a moment
in the doorway of the room where
for more years than he cared to count he
had lived with his dreams and memories of
-the past the walk up the hill from the
village station had tired him and he was
breathing a trifle heavily but it was not a
purely physical weariness that caused an-
drew to lean against the door frame his
was a fatigue of the spirit all his life an-
drew had been trying to reconcile thmgs-
as-they-were with what he thought they
ought to be he had fought the nearly al-
ways losing battle of the idealist given his
youth and mature years to the production
of verse and tuneful song he had dared
to be a poet-composer and pledged himself
and his beloved to suspense and poverty
now-andrew lorimers dreamy eyes were
dim his hair was white his beloved had
gone onward he was alone with-success
there is a bitterness to continual failure
in reward of unremitting endeavor but how
measure the heartache of the victor when
the laurels of triumph come-too late
  as he moved away from the door an-
drews mouth quivered there was a stifled
sobbing quaver in his sigh he looked aim-
lessly about the dusty untidy room here
in work he had found solace from lonesome-
ness
  he glanced over the table littered with
sheets of paper there he had spun words
to charm and give hope to others he had
found distraction some measure of com-
fort in shaping vital thoughts to simple
phrase over by the window was the old-
fashioned grand piano where he had sat
late o nights seeking the melody to carry
the joyous lilt or poignant sadness of his
songs now-there was no further incen-
tive to labor andrew lorimer had-ar-
rived each month when he went up to
town his publishers handed him a check of
overwhelming value but although he went
to the bank and turned those checks into
legal tender not a cent of those royal-
 
a
his for a soxg

ties had he spent or brought back with him
to his country home
   a lonely man usually lives frugally and
 the habit of making ends meet on the pro-
 ceeds of some of his earlier songs clung to
 andrew besides this and greater than
 material considerations was his deep per-
 sonal feeling toward the song which had
 brought him such great monetary reward
 and so much secret fame
   he went over to the piano on the rack
was a sheet of music it did not bear the
name andrew lorimer but all the same
those touching words and wooing haunting
melody were his the title of the song was
 gal o mine andrew the lonely singer
might pass away and be forgotten but his
song would never die
   yes-he had put his heart into that song
 and there was a subtle balm in knowing that
 it was being played and sung all over the
 world for the rest all the ease the lux-
 uries the fast-accumulating royalties would
 buy andrew had no desire for him the
 call was to another plane
   his hands fell gently on the keys and while
 he softly played he gazed out over the dark-
 ening hills in inarticulate unuttered
 phrase he was praying hoping that his
 work here was done that he would soon-
 soon be free to go beyond to where he knew
 his beloved was waiting for him
   then-such is the oddness of mans mind
-the practical the material pierced his
spiritual absorption there was all that
money what should he do with it how
dispose of it he had no relatives no
near and dear friends he had outlived
them all yet something must should be
done
   with a sudden movement of decision an-
drew got up he lighted his lamp and
there was a smile on his tired face as he took
the sheet of  gal o mine  from the piano
and sat down at his table the smile grew
to a suggestion of boyish mischief as he
wrote a few lines across the inner page of
the song and when he signed his name
he chuckled with satisfaction
   when the ink had dried he folded the
song and leaned back thoughtfully what
should he do with it where place it for
safe-keeping it was a small matter for
 consideration but it bothered the old man
 he could come to no decision then his
 thoughts drifted erratically from one sub-
 ject to another he thought of making
 himself a cup of tea-presently of getting
 something to eat-presently and-pres-
 ently a languor stole over andrew and all
 urge to thought or movement receded from
 him
ii
   i see old lorimer come in on the seven
twenty wonder what he goes up to town
for regular every month since last de-
cember hes been going up
  this remark proffered by the proprietor
of the village store and lounging club for
gossips of the male order was prompted
by idle curiosity no one in the village
could be expected to take much interest in
an old man who wasted his time playing
the piano and wasnt neighborly enough to
take his place among men and spit and
chew and talk politics and nonsense in the
ring around the store stove of a winter
evening or on the steps of the post office in
the summer all the same the storekeepers
observation brought immediate response
    i dont give a dang what the old cranks
doing in town or out of it he aint nothing
to me but theres one thing i aint going to
stand for and thats his cow coming over
into my place stead of gallivanting around
like he does ole lorimer better stay home
and mind his business and im the one to
tell him so too im going up there to-
night ill make him mend that fence and
pay damages see if i dont
   in emphasis of this statement fred trus-
com wrinkled his sandy eyebrows into a
knot showed a broken yellow fang as he
stuffed a wad of tobacco into his cavernous
mouth and shambled to the door
   the offspring of jealousy is spite here
then was the reason for fred truscoms
outburst over the mere mention of an-
drew lorimers name in some obscure
way he sensed the superiority of the white-
haired old man over himself he despised
lorimer for his gentle ways he hated him
because the children ran to him whenever
they saw him on the street he sneered
whenever he heard others speak with pity-

argosy-allstory weekly
ing respect of the old man who played the
piano
   also there was another reason for trus-
 coms story about the cow the pockets of
 his shabby creased clothes were empty of
 the thing he craved but disliked to work
 for he had no money therefore this
 was an excellent opportunity to go up to
 lorimers house start a wordy complaint
 and make himself a pest and nuisance until
 he got-damages
  grumbling and muttering to himself
 truscom left the village it was a night
 to lure even the callous-hearted to gentler
 mood but not so with truscom it is
 doubtful if he ever deigned to give a pass-
 ing glance at the star-patterned sky cer-
 tain that to him the mystery of the night
 was expressed in the phrase  plaguey
 dark there are blind people with more
 vision than some who have eyes to see with
 arrived at lorimers house truscom went
 in without knocking by way of announc-
 ing his entry and asserting his status as a
 brother and equal he clumped heavily as
 he went along the hall to the room where
 the light was
    ive come to collect for the damage
 your cow done he began and when lori-
 mer did not look up from his chair he re-
 peated his plaint in louder angrier tone
    sleepin muttered truscom in dis-
 gust when he found he was not favored
 with the slightest sign it riled him that
 the old man should not instantly awake
 to the call of his harsh voice he thumped
 across the room it was his intention to
 shake lorimer rudely but-he did not
   when the spirit leaves the body of those
 who have lived the good life the inanimate
 clay takes on an aloof majesty that even
 a vandal may hesitate to intrude upon be-
 sides-fred truscom was badly scared
 when he caught sight of the unmistakable
 pallor of the old mans down-bent face he
 retreated backed against the piano he
 stood there mechanically moistening his lips
 and wondering what he should do should
 he rush off spread the news and enjoy
 being the center of attraction would
 there not be food and drink and tobacco
 and a welcome in a dozen places for one
 who could tell the story of the passing of
andrew lorimer undoubtedly there would
be but-
   while he was grasping at these possibili-
ties of profit truscoms eyes shifted about
the room he felt a vague sense of peevish
resentment that he could see nothing of
value that he could-acquire his con-
temptuous glance took in the heavy furni-
ture the few pictures the bronze clock and
ornaments on the mantelpiece over the open
fireplace but to the ignorant eye only the
tawdry and glittering has any appeal
 junk he muttered and framed the
thought  wonder if hes got any money
hid away
  before he made any move to find a di-
rect answer to this question truscom
backed out of the room and out of the
house he went as far as the lane and
circled around in order to assure himself
that there was no one about it was a
needless precaution-a refinement of craft
brought about by the evilness of his in-
tentions-but his prowling satisfied his
sense of cunning he went back to the
room and lowered the lamp then he start-
ed his search he rummaged in drawers
looked in closets went into the old mans
bedroom and felt under the mattress and
he found nothing but disappointment
   nothing but an old pauper he
thought and returning to the front room
crept nearer to the old man he saw lying
under the lax hand the folded song he
read the title then bending closer he
slipped his dirty ghoulish hand into a pock-
et he found a stub of pencil and some
scraps of paper covered with writing next
-some letters these he replaced then
he found a worn leather wallet he could
feel there were coins in it a quick glance
showed him that there were also some bills
  after that truscom flitted he went
home by a circuitous route in the shuttered
secrecy of his sordid room he counted the
prize of his petty mean thievery he had
robbed andrew lorimer of twelve dollars
and ninety-eight cents
m
  until late the next day fred truscom
did not venture out it was nearly ten
his for a soxg

when he went to the store it surprised
him to find that the place was still open
and what was more it was crowded there
were at least a dozen people there they
were grouped in front of the counter they
all stopped talking and turned when trus-
com entered
  say exclaimed the storekeeper
  werent you up to lorimers place last
 night
 truscom shook his head  didnt go
 near it
  but you said you was going didnt
 you say you was going to get damages out
 of him for the damage his cow done
  changed my mind there aint no law
 against that is there
  no-but i reckon youll want to kick
 yourself for all the rest of your days that
 you didnt go as you said you was going
 to
 fred truscoms eyes shifted furtively
 from face to face it puzzled him to see
 that they were all regarding him with
 amusement rather than suspicion
  what is it youre getting at he de-
 manded
  old lorimers dead
 truscom simulated as best he could a
 look of surprise
  too bad he mumbled  but i dont
 see what ive got to be so upset about i
 wont get paid for that fence and all that
 but-
  you know that old lorimer wrote
 songs
  ive heard he did- said truscom cau-
 tiously
  ever hear of  gal o mine 
  sure
  he wrote it
 truscoms jaw sagged his yellow fang
 protruded  he wrote that
  wrote the words and the music its
 been selling like hot cakes all over he
 died worth moren a hundred thousand dol-
 lars in cash and theres more to come
  did-did he have it in the house
  not he kept it all in a safe-deposit
 vault in town
 truscom leaned against the counter he
 caught the storekeeper winking at one of the
 silent group
   whats the game he snapped
 what are you all gawping at
    well its like this explained the store-
keeper if youd gone up as you said
you was going to last night youd have been
worth a pile of money doctor said the
old man had been dead twelve or fourteen
hours when they found him this morning
so i guess he was gone by the time you
said you was to be there you shouldnt
have changed-
   but how would i have got anything
demanded truscom
   because youd have been the first one to
discover his body he must have felt he
was getting near the end he wrote his will
just before he died left every cent to the
one who found him only condition is that
hes to be buried next his wife thats all
if youd gone up there youd have come
into all his money as it is its the parsons
little clara wholl get it she went up with
some new laid eggs this morning she
found the old man sitting in his chair his
will was right there on his knee
   on his knee repeated truscom in a
dry whisper
   yes theyve been telegraphing and
phoning all day but there aint no one to
claim his money clara  get it all right
 but you say the will was on his knee-
 thats what im telling you ive seen
it it was written on that song he made
such a hit with
  fred truscom swayed slightly he
stared vacantly then his face distorted
with venom as he saw the smiles what
would the fools think of him if they knew
that he had been within a few inches of
that strange will what wouldnt their
laughter be if they could know that he
pledged his chance of a fortune for-twelve
dollars and ninety-eight cents he croaked
an oath-swung round and lurched out of
the store
  across the street lighted windows shone
through the trees a party was in progress
a sweetly singing voice trembled on a high
note then swung into a haunting refrain
the song was  gal o mine
  the sword of mockery turned in the gap-
ing wound of truscoms thwarted greed
he stumbled off into- the darkness
izzy kaplans kolumn
received via w  mcgeehan
the gate receipts
    tot since the time when izzy kaplan had been mistaken for an umpire by
     v an enthusiastic fan with a pop bottle had mcgeehan seen his partner so
    upset as when one night when the telegraph instrument had just clicked
    up the story of a fight izzy came stamping into the newspaper office
         his eyes blazed fire his teeth gleamed hungrily his hands clawed the air
        it was not that izzy had picked the wrong man to win izzy is too much of
    an expert to let details bother him what made izzy froth was that as he
    approached the carden a small dark stranger had darted from one of the pillars
    grabbed him by the buttonhole and tried to sell him izzy kaplan a ticket to the
    fight
        for twenty minutes mcgeehan abandoned his role of silent partner to assure
    izzy that he did not look like the kind of person who pays to get into anything
    at the end of that time izzy was sufficiently coherent to give to the world his views
    on the gate receipts-the editor
 eller writing into me is esking me who i would consider the
 biggest feller which ever was in sports i am sorry that i couldnt
 mention the name on account i dont know it but the feller
 in my opinion which he done it the biggest thing for sports
 was the feller which inwentioned gate reseats gate reseats
 is what the customers pay to see the show and if there wasnt
 no gate reseats the sporting business would be practically nothing
 at all
    i was esking benneh leonard which me and him is chust
 like that if he would be in the box fighting business if there
 was no gate reseats and he answered me pretty quick  izzv
 i am surprised that you should think i was such a rotten busi-
 ness man- and so it is with all of them sporting fellers like
 chack dempsey and baby ruthstein if there was no gate reseats them fellers would
 be all joining a trade so they could get it a chob somewhere
      it is the same way with texas rickardstein the great box fighting promoter
 i esked him only the other day what it was which attractioned him into the box
 fighting game when he had a nice salooning business in nevada  izzy he told me
  this is confidential between me and you and you shouldnt told nobody it was the
 gate reseats that attractioned me

izzy kaplans kollmn

      texas rickards tein should know something about gate reseats on account the
  gate reseats of the chack dempsey-george carpetstein right alone was worth over a
  million and a haiuf dollars it would almost make a feller cry now to read how chim
  corbett and choe choynski had it a box fighting on a secremento river ranal boat
  with no box reseats at all choe choynski s old man which he was a business man
  from russia like myseluf never forgave choe for the foolishness but it wasnt choes
  fault on account gate reseats hadnt been inwentioned yet
      i could remember back to the days when abie attefl was a champeen box fighter
  there was a business man before he would go into the ring he would alwavs esk
  the feller which was promotioning the show how much is the gate reseats and
  abie wouldnt take the fellers word for it neither abie was too smart before he
would hit the other feller a smesh on the chin he would awaxs count the house him-
sduf while the box fighting was going on
     besides being a wery smart business man abie also was a wery smart box ii ah ter
the other feller would be trying to hit him a poke in the eye but abie could duck
his head and keep cm counting he never would let anybody give him a blue eye on
account that would interfere with counting the house and getting the riggers exact
    wunst i heard him talking to a feller who was giving him a calling down and
saying come on and fight abie and abie said right beck to him  i aint
finished counting the geflery yet but when i do i will hit you a good smesh on the
chin
    and sure enough i beard abie talking to himseluf and saying - there is one
thousand and eighty-two dollars in that geliery and the promotioner told me it wouldnt
bold more than seven hundred dollars he is a swindler and i will have his life
i got to hum- up the fight because i am not giving him eight rounds of box fighting
for two rounds of gate reseats
    then abie reached out the right hand and hit the other bos tighter on the chin
he didnt even stop to hear the reverie counting him out on account he wanted to meet
the promotioner outside and have him count the house over i think that abie attefl
as the smartest business man that they ever had in the box fighting business maybe
he was too smart it is sometimes so that a feller could be too smart for his own good
i	am so smart myseluf that sometimes it really gets me worried
     it is too bad nobody knows who is the fellers that inwentioned the gate reseats
wo
argosy-allstory weekly
   v did they would have a mature oi him in every kwhaling fectoiy and box
   fighting areno in the country or ii they wouldnt they oughter you could get a
   stature done pretty cheap by any of those eyetaiian fellers which only the other dav
    one of them offered to sell me three for a dollar but they wasnt statures of anybodv
    which i knew
        you could pitcher for yourseiuf the scene how it was when the -ate reseats was
   first inwentioned a lot of fellers is in a field box fighting and basebailing and the
   customers is watching them for nothing then this smart feller comes akng and he
   gives a look and he sees all the customers and nobod -	  
        of course he must have been a feller from russia because that is where all the
   good business ideers like letting an oitermobile hit you and then suir somebody
   comes from he is standing there thinking with the brains that is under his derby hei
   finally he gets a option on a lot of lumber and he builds it a fence around the field
   where is the basebailing and the box fighting and he sends his brother moe out to
   collection from the customers at the gate
        at foist the customers puts up a holler customers would always holler a little
   until thev get used to it- after a while they wouldnt holler at all they would walk
   right up to the gate and get sore if you wouldnt take their money why yon could
   even read about fellers suing a tbeayter for not taking their money
        that is really how sports got to be a business and why they developed such
   smart box fighters like renneh leonard and chack dempsey and basebailing telers
   like chon mcgraw and baby ruthsiein if it wasnt for the gate reseats there
   wouldnt be no sports at all in this country- everybody would be an amachure and
   a customer would have nothing at all to do with his money
        gate reseats for efervthins is getting bigger and bigger every year ou couktat
    see the end of them yet because they havent really begun to commence starting ou
    could set sate reseats for anything if you only sot the brains i am bettirg mat i
    could promotion a cootie race in the yale bowl and sell out the house
        that wbv i am sorrv that i couldnt told you the name ot the idler who inwen-
    tioned sate reseats all i know is that he was a feller from my own people also i
    could sav that if he hadnt got the ideer when he dm i oet  would nave got it myselut
    on account you know i am ail the time thinking up ideers myseluf

a car that is trusted
the whole world over
 motor cars pour forth from
 europe to all the world
 they pour forth from
 america to every land
 where buyers are to be
 found
 if any car holds a special
 preference among these
 hundreds-even thousands
 -it is the hupmobije
 the foreign motor car
 buyer-in europe or else-
 where-has the worlds
 best to compare with and
 choose from
 yet his demand for the
 hupmobile gives us an ex-
 port volume out of all pro-
 portion to our total output
 -a volume which would be
 vastly larger if our home
 demand could be satisfied
 with fewer cars
 europe began to know the
 nupmobije almost as soon
 as america our first ex-
 ports were made in 
except in russia and some
of the balkan states the
hupmobile is represented
today in all the countries
of the world
in such out-of-the-way
quarters as the straits set-
pbetocraefe by ttndrrwued  undeiwl w t
canton china - the famom
fbexr pagoda
tlements it is known and
trusted the way it is known
and trusted here in america
india thinks as highly of it
as do the british isles
 in the fiji islands the
 philippines australia
 new zealand and south
 america-in lands where
 anything less sturdy than
 hupmobile construction
 means a short car-life-the
 name hupmobile stands
 for faithful endurance
 the qualities which give
 the hupmobile the high
 place it holds abroad are
 the qualities which make it
 so well thought of at home
 in america and abroad
the hupmobile is liked and
trusted for the sterling vir-
tues which keep it out of
the repair shop and which
enable it to do continually
things that seem impossible
for any car
