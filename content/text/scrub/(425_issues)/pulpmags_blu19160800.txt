author of the right of way the seats of the mighty
the money master blood will tell etc

i hem mcmahons yr anner
theyll be the death of some
one before theyre done with
it the way they carry on
look at him-look at him now ragin
up the street with them harses and he
drunk too and no constable annywhere



theres no good in them fellas not a
hapurth

it was patsy kemaghan who spoke
he was standing outside the office of
the young doctor to whom he ad-
dressed his complaint

the young doctor was just getting


the blue book magazine

into his buggy for a long drive across
the prairie on a visit to a patient in
silence for a moment he watched the
galloping horses and the swaying
wagon with the driver erect his out-
stretched hands holding the reins above
his head as he shouted wild encourage-
ment to the excited pair presently
with a sorrowful shake of the head the
young doctor replied

  its the best of them too its phil
mcmahon the cut of his jib isnt the
same as the other two it isnt a bad
face and hes open in his ways the
others go blanketed as the indians
say

  it doesnt do em much good anny-
how remarked patsy everyones
got onto them theyre horse-thieves
and thatll come out all right some
day

  the young doctor was in his buggy
now getting the reins into his hands
patsy he said reprovingly dont
give your toneue so much mouth its
dangerous calling a man a thief even
when its true for myself i dont
believe phil mcmahon would steal
horses-or anything else

  patsy scratched his head well
yr anner he said id take your
word about a man quicker than i would
annyone elses all i can say is hes
aither a damned hippycrit with his
laughin face and roarin voice or hes
iust a scamp with the devil in him but
how could he be straight and open and
his blood-brothers what they are

  patsy youd be keeping roe here all
day if id let you though you know
theres the sick waiting me remarked
the young doctor preparing to start
and yet looking at the other with a
benevolent eve for the little irishman
had not an ill streak in him theres
this to be said for him youll admit-
that he has only joined his brothers
within the last month and he maynt
know what they are

  shure thats true for you doctor
dear answered patsy quickly thats
as likely as annything else hes been
in tdaho in the states yonder for years
past rut i know what tom and matt
mcmahon was in ireland twenty years
airo-hegare i do ive hard tell
like boy like man sez the man that

told me theyre no credit to ireland
them two though yourself too only
come from inniskillcn that i never
hard army good of yr anner

  the young doctor smiled quizzically
and laid his whip on patsys shoulders
i left inniskillen because id have
starved to death as a doctor the place
being so healthy and so little for me
to do the lord loveth inniskillen
patsy goodness is health and the
place was iiealthy because it sent the
bad men straight away to hell or
kerry and liell had the preference
with them

  patsy flushed for he was a kerry
man ami loved it and he was ready to
burst forth in protest but he caught
the look in the others eye and he only
smiled helplessly as the young doctor
continued

  never mind patsy they tell me
kerrys better the last fifteen years-
since you left so no one can say you
havent done some good in the world

  get along my lads he added to the
fretful pair of horses which instantly
tightened the traces and bravely trotted
away

  patsy watched the young doctor out
of sight admiringly if be asked me
to hand me liver out for a dogs break-
fast id do it he said with decision
and then swung round to watch phil
mcmahon tearing down the street
again his voice breaking into snatches
of ribald song

dhil was having what he called a

	hoot he had had only one hoot
since coming to askatoon and the place
had got on his nerves somehow down
in montana and idaho and wisconsin
and wyoming he had had the time of
his life as he called it and it was only
homesickness to see his two elder
brothers-so much older than himself-
which had brought him to askatoon

  he had been warmly welcomed by
tom and matt who forthwith deter-
mined to make him settle down on the
ranch and ultimately join their gang of
horse-thieves operating on the border
they had skillfully organized it but
they needed one who had phils popular
gifts his daring and resource his in-
genuity and brains to carry through
the youngest of the mcmahons



their boldest proposals successfully
neither of them had phils gifts or
looks though in one sense tom mc-
mahon was a handsome man with a
strong blue eye and well-molded head
a fine full beard while in stature he far
exceeded phil yet he did not inspire
confidence and matt was little better

  phil however had made friends ever
since his coming to askatoon particu-
larly among the casual population and
non-church-members he was the es-
sence of querulous good-nature if such
a contradiction may exist he was free
with his money and full of good stories
and an attraction to every saloon and
hotel in the place though the young
doctor and patsy kernaghan had
frowned upon his reckless driving in
the streets the people who looked out
of the doors of the saloons at the tear-
ing onset of man horses and wagon said
merely that he was showing off and
they yelled rude remarks at him

  the town constable however moved
thereto by the complaints of certain
citizens intent to repress riotous con-
duct and the sale and use of strong
drink went out and stood in the middle
of the street holding both hands up
against the thundering pair of horses
and their driver as for phil he took
no notice and the constable would have
been run down had he not jumped
aside just in time

  it was lucky that the street was fairly
empty of people and conveyances this
was chiefly by accident for it was mar-
ket-day and market-time and most
traffickers were in the market-square
there were enough people left how-
ever to furnish tragedy for phils
escapade and priscilla meekin who
had a preoccupation of mind and a self-
will which working together might
make dark mischief for herself and
others nearly made it a fact

driscilla was of an age from
which the tassels of hope do not
hang in any numbers and her life had
been a series of disappointments it
did seem absurd that a girl should have
an income of seven hundred dollars a
year and yet should not have been able
to abandon the title of spinster and set
up a home for two was she not thrifty

and careful would she not be a de-
voted wife to a real man-not the men
she talked to in the mirror when alone
in her room yet no one really worth
while in all her thirty-three years had
ever asked her to marry him and she
had not been successful in her own way
of asking which of course was not
asking outright still rigby the drug-
gist when finding it difficult to carry on
his business for lack of increased capi-
tal heard opportune hints from pris-
cillas gentle lips and several young
ministers of religion had been carefully
waylaid in seasons and circumstances
when the young mans fancy lightly
turns to thoughts of love indeed in
desperation she had even starved her-
self ill so that the young doctor might
be called in to attend her all to no
purpose it was not easy to face the
future with the straw-colored faded
priscilla whose eyebrows were like
strips of dandelion-white whose lips
were so thin that they seemed a mere
line of faintish pink whose body was
so deprecating and pliant that it almost
wriggled whose voice had a coaxing
affected tone which only the most tone-
less ear could endure-and rigby sang
in the methodist choir and the young
ministers to their credit married for
love rather than money as for the
young doctor he soon showed himself
very unsympathetic a perfect butcher
and brute priscilla had called him in
her pique after his expensive treat-
ment-for the young doctor deter-
mined to teach her a lesson-though
he had only cut up her feelings and not
her body indeed there was so little
of that to cut away that he had ordered
for her much starchy food to stiffen
her pliant back and make impossible
her ingratiating wriggle

  it was the anemic priscilla with the
watery blue eyes who brought phil
mcmahons career as a charioteer to
an end for the moment by throwing
herself at great peril into his tempestu-
ous path it was all pure accident
which however might easily have
ended in her being driven decorously
and somberly to the churchyard on the
hill near by to askatoon

  it was like priscilla to bungle her
accident as she had bungled everything


the blue book magazine

else in her life save in the hard bargain
she had driven for led and hoard with
the wife of her cousin jonas billings
she had lived with them free of charge
for months after her fathers death
and then had so worked upon the feel-
ings of lonas wife who was a devout
methodist by becoming converted
that when the bargain was struck she
got her living far below market price
much to her husbands disgust for he
was no methodist he hated cant he
did not like priscilla and he felt more
at home when she was not there he
was a spectator of her accident now

  priscilla had had some words with a
smirking clerk in a dry-goods store
because of certain advice he had given
her as to the color and size of some
stockings and with angry eyes and an
unbecoming flush to her mottled cheeks
she flung out of the shop and proceeded
to cross the street she was even talk-
ing to herself-for the stockings urged
upon her by the officious clerk were
much too large and why should he
recommend a gold-yellow to match
her own coloring as he had said

che was oblivious of all sounds save
the loud noises in her anemic brain
when she stepped from the sidewalk
into the street suddenly some one
called out to her it was jonas billings
he saw her danger from the oncoming
horses and wagon and he shouted at
her

   priscilla-say look out he called
look out-you damn fool he added
under his breath for unless she hurried
she would be run down

  jonas familiar voice roused her out
of her distempered abstraction and she
looked up startled she saw phil mc-
mahon erect in the wagon shouting
the reins held high above his head and
panic seized her she was fully three-
fourths of the way across and could
have made the remaining distance
easily but with frantic excitement she
jerked round and started back

  hell-dont-go on  called out
jonas in anxiety and alarm she was
too dumfounded to grasp what he said
in her minds disorder there was a
vague sense that it was safer to return
than to make for the farther shore on

which stood repellent rigby the drug-
gist back she went scrambling like a
lame hen toward the store where she
had been insulted as she afterwards
declared to a sympathetic listener-a
spinster older than herself who re-
peated the insult wherever it would be
effective

  people stood on the sidewalk trans-
fixed with alarm for nothing could be
done to save her everything depended
on herself and on a drunken fellow in
the juggernaut thing bearing down on
her she herself had terrible sensations
of black clouds smothering her and
through the clouds huge monsters
flinging themselves on her there was
no wifi no control of the disordered
senses she was far more drunken
in a way than phil mcmahon that
was proved presently when he in a
sudden and sobering realization of her
danger dexterously gathered in the
loose reins and wrenched at the mad-
dened horses mouths it was a great
tribute to liis strength his skill and
his presence of mind that he saved
priscilla from death and himself from
a charge of manslaughter the horses
did not quite clear her however as
they swept by the shoulder of one
struck her slightly and threw her on
the ground free of hoofs and wheels
but only by inches

  she lay moveless where she had
fallen

tonas billings was the first to
j reach her and rigby racing across
came next followed by several fussy
folk much excitcd asking if she were
dead rigby soon set all doubts at rest
about that he had her taken over the
way to his store and in its half-mysteri-
ous atmosphere with its suggestive and
magical odors she was presently re-
stored to consciousness

  her awakening was not unhappy
she at once realized how soothing it
was to be an object of interest-a thing
dear to a certain type of woman this
first satisfaction was darkened how-
ever by the fact that she was in the
arms of her cynical cousin jonas bill-
ings who would waste no sentiment on
her even at the last gasp she had
hardly struck the balance between the
the youngest of the mcmahons



advantages and the disadvantages of
her situation when phil mcmahon
entered the store a little noisily he
made straight for where she lay looking
round in a languishing way supported
by jonas billings knee

   say missus im sick and sorry and
silly over this business he said to
priscilla one hand waving and pulling
off his hat with the other i must ha
been well soaked but it sobered me
all right when i saw your trouble i
felt like a boy when lie watches castor-
oil coming to him in a spoon it
knocked me it-he turned to the
other people in the store-well i
dont hesitate to say that i got as
skeered as if i was hittin my own
mother in the face

  some one in the store giggled he
had called priscilla missus and lie
had indirectly placed her on the list of
the elderly ones truth is with her
attempt to make the most of the situa-
tion priscilla had lengthened her face
and she looked so piously piteous that
it increased her years very noticeably
she forgot that only vivacity-even her
assumed and affected vivacity-could
keep her looks in line with her years
she certainly was throwing away her
profits out of this transaction

  these profits were squandered en-
tirely a moment later when indignant
and chagrined at phils manner of ad-
dressing her and seeing the cffect of it
upon the lookers-on she heard him say
missus-say missus i hope youll
forget it alls right that comes right
but of course it dont wipe the blame
off me i might ha robbed a happy
home of its pride and beauty i hope
youll take it kindly and say philip i
forgive you-philip being my bap-
tismal name but called phil by every-
body youve seen enough of young
people in your time to forgive em i
was always young for my age and i
was feelin partickler young to-day it
bein my birthday-thirty-sweet and
simple thirty thats why i let myself

fsay missus let bygones be

bygones and i hope youll accept this
here fifteen dollars the last i got in
my pocket and take em home to the
little ones-a gift from a repentant
sinner

he held out three five-dollar bills
toward her with an ingratiating
manner and added i bet your hus-
bandll be so glad you escaped that
hell forget all about me and the chil-
dren wont mind- why jeerusalem
the last exclamation was caused by
priscillas knocking his hand aside with
spirit not to say temper

  by words he certainly had wiped out
much of the profit in the incident which
might have been hers she could see
people sniggering at the reference to
her little ones and her husband
and there was rigby the druggist with
his hand over his mouth-rigby whom
she had once tried to capture rigby
happily married now also there was
her cousin jonas who would gibe at
her forever after it was a humiliation
not to be borne

  she sat up and with finger out-
stretched to the constable said

  take him to jail ill never be well
again ive got internal injuries put
him in handcuffs he tried to kill me
he dont care who he rolls in the dust

i	was as near death-take him to jail
at once

  the constable was precise in his
reply he was a man of few words
he would probably have tried to
marry priscilla long ago if she had not
talked so much for her seven hundred
dollars a year was quite worth while
but he could not stand people who
babbled he was notoriously hard on
brawlers and loud-talking drunken
men and lenient with the silent and
morose disturbers of the peace

  i cant put him in jail he said in
response it aint the law but you
can summons him-and i can summons
him and thats what im goin to do
hes got to see that this town aint in
idaho hes got to realize he must
stop when i hold up my hand i done
that and he kept on and here you
are ill have him up all right miss
get home and dont worry

  what a fuss-and i was ready to
square it said phil in cheerful dis-
appointment as he put the money in
his pocket again well im sorry
you cant forgive me missus

  she aint married said rigby the
druggist with friendly intent


the blue book magazine

  it was too much for priscilla how-
ever she scrambled weakly to her

feet

  hell have to pay for this she said
almost hysterically for rigbys com-
ment had touched her in a tender

corner

  say id have offered you more if
id known you was a single woman-
honest  would remarked phil hold-
ing out a friendly hand to her as she
passed him making for the door

  no one knew why phil said that
perhaps it was his native chivalry
towards women

the net result of phil mcmahons
dangerous escapade was a sum-
mons it was followed by a
trial of short duration because the
law-breaker was not willing to put up
a defense he pleaded not guilty but
that was merely to give his lawyer a
chance of making a plea for an easy
sentence during the trial phil was
carefully and almost amusingly sym-
pathetic in the thrilling dramatic
moment to priscilla when she gave evi-
dence his eye was limpid with magnan-
imous regard he beamed upon her
that was his way scamp as he was
be had regard and respect for the oppo-
site sex anyone that wore a dress-
if that dress was clean and its wearer
had a clean name also-commanded his
homage in other words he liked em
clean and damn the looks though if
they had the looks it was better fun
he was an incorrigible adonis and yet
with no evil toward women in him

  phils trial gave askatoon a great
day not so much because of the misde-
meanant as because of priscilla whose
incursion into the realms of legitimate
drama with a smack of comedy was
a relish to every meal eaten by the
people of askatoon for several days
they all admitted that priscilla had
come into her own in a way sensa-
tion in which she should be a living
breathing central figure had always
been the desire of her heart and here
it was phil had opened up for her
doors to a red sky of sensation

  in the witness-box she was so moved
by the central position she occupied that
she seemed oblivious of the biting sug-
gestive and subtly insolent questions of
augustus burlingame the lawyer-who
none too secretly disreputable had even
borrowed money of her in the past
and because she had babbled of his un-
aid loans he did not scruple to make
er modest goodness appear naked as-
surance when he had her now under
cross-examination he did not however
carry his ruthless game far because
phil mcmahon intervened saying
give it the hush let the girl be
its me thats done the harm and all i
can say is im proud to see her alive
the wind being taken out of bur-
lingames sails the trial soon ended a
fine of fifty dollars or a month in jail
being imposed the month in jail was
a heavy punishment but when he an-
nounced it the magistrate assumed that
phil would naturally elect to pay the
fine his experience had been that
men would rather pay five hundred dol-
lars than be in jail for three days

  after a judicious and reproving little
speech from the bench phil stood up
but he did not put his hand in his
pocket he seemed to be waiting pa-
tiently for something

  pay the fine-fifty it is whispered
burlingame to him

  ill not pay a cent of any fine re-
turned phil loudly ive spent all i
mean to spend on the fun i had a
blamed good drunk it was but its over
i paid in cash all it was worth
moneys no punishment to me w hen
i have it anybody can have it it bums
my pocket money cant pay for
breakin the law not with me ive
broke the law and ill see it through
on principle im a friend of the law
and prisons a good place for them
thats broke it and are weary of ill-
doin so take me where ill be eatin
bread that i wont have to pay for
everyone laughed except the magis-
trate priscilla and the chief constable
priscilla did not laugh because now
that the thing was over the reaction
had come the way phil had looked
at her during the trial had fluttered her
in spite of herself she had taken the
attitude of an avenging goddess and
the youngest of the mcmahons



she had got out of it all there was to
get somehow punishment was not so
sweet as it looked	

  being what she was an epitome of
the weaknesses of her sex she sud-
denly gave way to one of them which
was to punish and then to pity be-
sides phi mcmahons voice was a
thing to remember it had a coaxing
element which had been loo much for
women of more character than herself
and when in leaving the courtroom he
turned and with deviltry in his eye and
kindness on his tongue he said to her
priscilla oh priscilla tis for you i
go to jail she felt a shiver of emotion
go through her so powerful was it
that she even failed to notice how
everybodys attention was fixed on phil
while she remained unnoticed save by
a few of her own sex who gave to
their congratulations a tone of assassi-
nation

dhil went to jail cheerfully it was

	not the first time he had been there
it had no terrors for him particularly
in summer-time when he could be nice
and warm and sleep to his hearts con-
tent also he liked doing the unex-
pected thing and certainly his going to
jail was not expected as he said it
flabbergasted the old rooster on the
bench

  when the door of the cell closed on
him he remarked to the warder well
theres a lot of people cant bother me
for a while blessed be jonathan and
john

  for some days what with sleeping
and reading things like the story of
the jumping frog from the jail
library he got along quite well but
presently he became the bored victim
of a conspiracy which even the jail
walls could not shut out

  for priscilla troubled in spirit be-
came a conspirator no sooner had
phil gone to jail than she repented hav-
ing sent him there his playful re-
proachful words to her as he left the
court kept ringing in her ears she
took them seriously and by the time
forty-eight hours had gone round she
flung herself into the storm of another
of her romances her mind kept turn-
ing to the jail and despite the disparag-

ing remarks of jonas billings-who
heard of her intentions through his
wife-she conceived the noble idea of
converting phil

  with the consent of the sheriff who
had a sense of humor and saw no moral
breach of the rules in doing the thing
she sent phil tracts books of travel
the life of john wesley the ad-
ventures of a missionary in uganda
and so forth also at last she se-
cured permission to send him good
things to eat including a frosted cake
on which in beautiful pink sugar she
inscribed the words

           pull for the shore sailor

          pull for the shore

  to the cake she attached a paper
giving the whole of the words of the
hymn

  she was indifferent to the fact that
askatoon made sport of her she was
bent on a high enterprise or such was
her make-believe as for phil he
really had a taste for reading and
though the tracts startled him he be-
came engrossed in the adventures of
the missionary of uganda and even
the life of john wesley had its interest
for him especially that part where the
great man was persecuted for his con-
victions indeed he talked quite sym-
pathetically about wesley to the
warders

as for the food sent him by priscilla
it was very palatable and his
native tact and common sense made
him share it with his greedy and grate-
ful warders however in spite of the
uganda missionary john wesley and
the jelly-cake he became intensely
bored at the end of a fortnight in
which he made up his mind that pris-
cillas attentions were not wholly virtue
pursuing vice for vices good but
woman stalking man for sentiments
sake

  yet when he was informed by the
sheriff that priscilla wished to visit him
in prison and to read to him in the
presence of the warder he recklessly
consented he was really pleased
when she did come and still more so
when the warder stood outside the ceil
not within hearing though able to see


the blue book magazine

what was going on inside at any in-
stant

  phil made short work of the read-
ing of the tracts and presently en-
gaged priscilla in such conversation as
she had never known in the thirty odd
years of her harmless life nothing he
said however might not have been
published in a sunday-school paper-
or a comic journal yet despite the
blameless speech priscillas hot eyes
slightly trembling lips and nervous
fingers all of which told a tale of emo-
tion conveyed to phil that it was her
will to put him in greater danger than
she had been from iris wild horses and
the murderous wheels of his wagon
suddenly he felt as a man would who
must fight an armed enemy with his
naked hand he had no courage at all
with women if they were straight as
he called it

  your time in jail will be up in an-
other week priscilla said at last i
wont be a bit happy till youre free
again

  aw a week or so is nothin re-
marked phil carelessly theres plenty
to do here theres the physical exer-
cises and the eatin exercises and-
raising his voice-theres the fatiguin
exercise of watchin them fools of
warders stick their noses in where
theyre not wanted

  he said this at the moment when his
warder had stepped forward to the
barred opening in the door to warn
priscilla that her time was up so
taken aback was the warder at the tone
of phils voice and the humorously
malicious character of the remark that
he fell back with a grim smile

  i pray for you every night said
priscilla with curious little undulations
of her body and an embarrassing misty
look in her eyes

  think of that phil returned
just think of that now about what
time every night is this holy action per-
formed for the man that put the life
of a pious paramount woman in dan-
ger

  he had to indulge in extravagance to
cover his actual helplessness he was
free from entanglement with any
woman alive but he would have run
till he dropped if he were on the trail

and priscilla pursued him his bones
became ropes at the thought of what

might happen

  at nine oclock every night she
answered fluttered and i feel it in me
that my prayer will be answered

dhil was like one trying to beguile

	a lunatic he had the stark pre-
monition that what she prayed for was
a walk up the aisle of the church with
a man about his size carrying a gold
ring in the right-hand pocket of his
waistcoat while another man with a
big book in his hand and a white tie
under his chin would wind up an em-
barrassing business with the words
let no man put asunder

  now think of that i he repeated
ive often wondered what was the
right time to say prayers and whether
they ought to be said standin up like
the presbyterians or sittin down like
the quakers or gettin on the knees
like all the holy people of the metho-
dists and baptists are you a metho-
dist or a baptist he added in a tone
that was like the interest which one of
the apostles might have felt in the sad-
ducees

  priscilla undulated modestly oh
im a methodist she answered i
found grace five years ago

  phil brightened something familiar
had struck his ear it gave him a
chance of getting away from her
smothering sentimentality

  oh well were both in the same box
then he remarked five years ago
it was down in montana i went huntin
grace and i found her too dang it
but she was a prize-packet she
wasnt unmarried like you she was
married but her boy got smashed in
the ranges and she went huntin him
and got lost well the way bill sparks
nick godalming and myself went hunt-
in her hell-to-leather was a caution
and twas me that found her five
years ago you found grace and five
years ago  found grace well well
it shows doesnt it he did not how-
ever say what it showed

  there was something devilishly inno-
cent and childlike in his face his
natural sense of humor had suddenly
given him courage
the youngest of the mcmahons 

  times up said the warder per-
emptorily through the barred opening
and then he straightway swung the
door wide open

  phil turned on him with mock in-
dignation is there no sense of con-
venience in a jail is there no man-
ners in a warder we were finding
grace he said and youve put your
ugly face between

  pie reached out a hand it swal-
lowed priscillas as a hippopotamus
might swallow a fly nine oclocks
the time to be remembered he added
in a voice at once malicious and mock-
ingly tender

  he could not help it he was bom
that way and the woman was going-
that was the great thing and in sheer
gratitude he would say to her anything
that came to his mind

  i hear theyre to let you out of
prison before the full time is up she
said at the door youll let me know
when youre leaving wont you-the
very minute youre leaving please dear
friend

  id die before id forget answered
phil and she did not see the double
meaning in his words

  a minute afterward he sat down limp
and helpless

  shell not be waitin for me at the
door of the jail when i go he said
huskily no by jiminy-jo-ill go in
the middle of the night

  then he asked the warder for a
dipper of water he had never been
so thirsty in his life

  phew coppers all hot he said
as he gulped the water down

ill

the day after phil left jail with
the regrets of the sheriff and the
warders following him-for he
had made himself popular in that stern
circle-he plunged into the mild dissi-
pation of a logging-bee at the house of
old rrick tannahill his brothers tom
and matt with six of their ranchmen
were also present it was the mc-
mahons cue to make themselves neigh-
borly and also for some time tom had
been looking toward eileen tanna-

hills daughter looking toward has
more than one meaning in the west
you look toward with a glass in your
hand and you look toward a woman
who has your admiration the sturdy
ranchman had made up his mind that
he would add eileen to his household
if it were possible though he had not
yet conveyed his purpose to eileen he
had been on his good behavior to her
on the few occasions they had met and
he had won her gratitude by organizing
the bee for the building of the new
house and rounding up over sixty help-
ers who were trained in the work of
building log-houses

  brick tannahill was by no means a
prepossessing man in appearance for
his nose had been broken in his youth
and he had had an injury to one eye
which somewhat disfigured him but
he was a whimsical old fellow and he
had a kindly disposition there was
no doubt however about the comeli-
ness of eileen she was alone and
separate in her good beauty with her
soft blue eyes and their long lashes
her wavy black hair her dimpled cheek
and ci i and a figure of sweet supple-
ness srie would have been the pride
of better places than askatoon but she
had no preferential position because
she was only the daughter of old brick
tannahill who had been little better
than an ordinary laborer till he had
been left two thousand dollars by a
relative in ireland and had taken up
a government grant of land

  the girl however had none of the
characteristics of a laborers daughter
she had mental gifts above the aver-
age and she was ambitious and deter-
mined she had secretly been sorely
hurt by the petty uppishness of those
who arranged the social tests of aska-
toon  and she had determined that she
would yet be recognized for had there
not been a canon of the church in h- r
family by which it will be seen that
eileen was not perfect though her im-
perfections were no crime in one of her
sex it remained that she was bright
and cheerful simple and unaffected
and she easily captured the good will
of all the men that came to the logging-
bee among them phil mcmahon who
had never seen her before


the blue book magazine

the subjection of phil was instant
for the first time he was ashamed
of having been a jail-bird but he
worked like a trojan at the bee and
was the life of the crowd meeting chaff
and gibe by chaff and gibe putting one
man against another in the competitive
work of the day completely usurping
his brother toms leadership-not
wholly to his regret unselfish though he
was for there was eileen

  eileen was conscious of what the
glance of his eye meant and it brought
a flutter to her pulse-a little to her
chagrin for phil had done no good to
himself by having gone to jail and
people had said dark things about him
and his drunken exploits yet to her
in spite of all there was something
compelling in his devil-may-care ways
and laughing impudent face also he
had great physical strength and athletic
grace so it was that when their eyes
met or their hands touched as he
helped her to place the pails of coffee
and cold meats on the tables she had a
thrill of interest and excitement she
could not help coquetting with him
shyly it was done carefully though
spontaneously yet it attracted the at-
tention of two or three rough spirits
who were secretly envious of the mc-
mahon gang and as the day wore
on a spirit of provocation began to
show itself once after eileen had
had a few friendly words with phil
sam shorthorn of the shorthorn lot
as the men from his ranch were called
said to eileen did you know miss
the new name for a jail

  eileen recognized a malicious pur-
pose but she shook her head and
poured shorthorn out another cup of
coffec

  its the courtin-house was the sar-
castic reply from the courthouse to
the courtin-house-thats the game
its a regular system now the things
that go on in the courthouse aint nothin
to what goes on in the courtin-house

  ill have to take your word for it
ive never been in either answered
eileen i suppose its funny she
added as the shorthorn lot laughed
loudly but i dont see it and i cant
laugh

  priscilla saw it all right short-

horn said and laughed loudly  pull
for the shore sailor pull for the
shore says priscilla and the sailor
pulled his weight he knew a lot
about pullin before priscilla pulled
him into court and that was a way-up
maritime display hip hip hooray
for priscilla and the sailor hip hip
hooray

   thought no one was to drink liquor
till the bee was over remarked eileen
sarcastically and there was a flush to
her cheek

  he hasnt been drinking liquor here
miss said phil mcmahon softly he
come here drunk-what was left from
yesterday and the day before and last
week-and so way back

dhil was getting angry several
 had chaffcd him rudely all morn-
ing about priscilla and he had met the
gibes good-humoredly but when there
were insinuations of a vulgar kind
about the spinster who had drawn upon
herself the comment of the community
he grew steadily resentful and an-
swered his tormentors brusquely as
a rule he was very quick to anger but
there was in him a real sense of
delicacy where women were concerned
and he did not want a row here at
eileen tannahills home nor did he
want further gossip about priscilla
he saw now that he had been a fool in
permitting priscilla to send him things
and visit him in jail and he thought
the less said or done on his part the
soonest mended

  for some hours there was a lull in
the coarse chaffing and sidelong re-
marks but toward evening sam short-
horn who through jealousy was evi-
dently determined to punish phil as
much as possible began to torment him
he initiated his attack none too strate-
gically and at last he ventured a re-
mark of an offensive nature about pris-
cilla within hearing of eileen on the
instant phil touched in his most chival-
rous corncr and hot with accumulated
anger flung the pail of coffee he was
carrying for eileen in shorthorns face

  long in the tooth but good sport
for them that dont pick and choose-
and watch the census boys was the
remark made by shorthorn
the youngest of the mcmahons



  he never made another of that kind
in his life for the coffee was in his
face and a moment later phil and he
were locked in each others arms
shorthorn tried to draw his knife but
to no purpose phils blood was up
and all the resources of a lifetime were
called into play while his brothers
stood watching the crowd lest there
should be a movement on the part
of shorthorns friends there was
however no necessity for the vigilance
for the one unpardonable thing in the
western mens eyes had been done-
a woman had been slandered-and
sympathy was with phil

  moreover it was over too soon for
any faction fight phil had suddenly
got the grip for which he had been
working since they closed and he flung
die stalwart shorthorn over his shoul-
der like a bag shorthorn came down
with a thud his head striking the
splintered bole of a small tree which
had been cut down he did not move
for half a minute the crowd waited
then some one rushed forward knelt
down beside him and felt his heart

   it was still

  phil looked at the body in a dazed
way for a moment then put on his coat
and turned to go two of the short-
horn lot moved forward as though to
prevent him

  im goin to the sheriff to give my-
self up he said it was an accident
but ill take what i get without squeal-
ing

  then he marched away his brothers
following and eileen watched them go
with horror in her eyes

iv

in jail again on a charge of man-
slaughter phil awaited his trial with
indifference in the town of aska-
toon priscilla awaited it with an im-
mense emotion-one much too big for
either her mind or her body a man
was to be tried for killing another man
who had defamed her she was the
center of a tragic situation she had
been the object of a supreme act of
devotion a man had been killed for
her sake and the slayer was in jail

  it was a bigger thing by a thousand
times than priscilla had ever expected
to happen in her life it transcended
the most brilliant dream of her imagi-
nation people who load never been
very nice to her now treated her with
respect she had a share in the heroic
in spite of her watery blue eyes her
faded cheeks her straw-colored eye-
brows and hair even jonas billings
disparaging and sarcastic remarks could
not lower her temperature her chance
had come at last she was sure now
that phil was in love with her

  she insisted on being called for the
defense when the trial came on bur-
lingame with useful intuition saw the
danger of such a course for it was
supremely necessary that his client
should not suffer ridicule that he be
kept in an atmosphere of heroism and
chivalry before the court and so he
told phil who was greatly alarmed at
the idea of priscillas appearing at the
trial at all he could face judge and
jury but he wilted at the thought of
facing the woman who would lay her
life at his feet

  at last phil devised a scheme that he
believed would temper her transports
he asked the sheriff to allow her to
visit the jail and he arranged that she
should be admitted at the very time
when he expected the new unmarried
minister of the baptist church to visit
him

  at the appointed time priscilla en-
tered the door of his cell with an in-
tolerable romance in her eyes and the
flush of a hectic sentiment on her cheek
phil had braced himself to the ordeal
but he was hardly prepared for the
trembling passionate figure who came
toward him with hands outstretched
he suddenly felt weak for he seemed
to feel her arms around his neck he
caught her hands however in time to
counter that danger

  o my defender-my dear dear de-
fender-at last she said with a smile
sick with sentimentality

  heaven is our helper returned
phil with a veiled grimace

  oh yes-how sweet it is to owe our
debt to heaven she replied but
you were heavens handmaid she
added gushingly


the blue book magazine

in her excitement she did not notice
what is called in the west her

break phil as a handmaid was
truly an illusion

maid-of-all-work added phil
drvly salary no object-workin for

heaven its own reward

  she did not realize yet the silly mis-
take in grammar she had made nor that
phil was taking a rise out of her
she was so agitated that her eyes were
glazed by the tire of her emotions

  oh dear friend i felt sure you
would find peace if you had time she
said with simpering solemnity those
tracts anil loks i sent you-in the soli-
tude of your cell they ojened up the
gates of understanding they brought
conviction and a sense of sin they-
im likely to have conviction twice
in a month remarked phil and as
for a sense of sin i guess ive had that
ever since i stole paps tobacco and
mas pies outen the pantry when i was
a youngster senses was always a
strong point with me

  but your stay here has brought you
to the mercy seat hasnt it asked
priscilla

  if you call a jury of twelve men
from sokash county the mercy seat i
expect im here but im not mashed
on mercy-leastways i was mashed on
mercy once-mercy maggs she was
but not the mercy you mean

  the palpitating priscilla began to
doubt her own hopes i know its
only your manner of speaking but you
should not trifle with such things she
remarked ruefully im sure its only
because you feel deeply and dont want
your real feelings to be seen

  well its plain i succeed in it
rejoined phil maliciously if you-
she interrupted him with a hysterical
little simper oh you neednt say it-
i know it all-philip you killed a
man for my sake and i can never to
my dying day never-oh i thank the
lord morning and night that i have
helped to snatch a brand from the burn-
ing that there was something which
roused in you-

  phil could stand it no longer say
he said i only done for you what id
have done for any woman on earth
when a man spoke of her as shorthorn

done and youd been kind to me-
that cake and currant loaf and pump-
kin pie and the books they clinched it
but if it had been old sary ginnis the
washerwoman id have done it just
the same he riled me a lot that
shorthorn and i wasnt talcin any
more from him i itched to lay him
out the minute i set eyes on him at
the bee a skunk he was but i wasnt
aimin at killin him not for no woman
on earth i got to face a judge and
jury too for it and-

  she almost threw herself in his arms
oh my brave one you-

  dont talk that way he interrupted
irritably thats no way to talk to a
man thats to be tried for manslaughter
i aint fit company for you-not for one
frozen minute i put shorthorn out of
action forever and i got to pay im
sorry i killed him there aint no wom-
an thats worth a life like that-and
im tired of jail already

  you shall not be here long-you
shall go free ill go into the witness-
box and say why you did it thatll
clear you i told mr burlingame so

  im not sure i wouldnt rather go to
jail for ten years than see you in the
witness-box remarked phil with
meaning but not a meaning that she
apprehended i wouldnt want to be
in that position i couldnt stand it
im tough but id break down if i saw
that

ttiis time he spoke with an apparent

	purpose the first words were full
of sarcasm not understood by her
but the last two sentences were spoken
with mock feeling and tenderness he
was determined to bring things to an
issue at once and he anticipated accur-
ately what she would do

  she stood gazing at him for one in-
stant  then in spite of the fact that one
of the warders was looking in the open-
ing of the door she almost threw her-
self upon him her hands caught at
his arms her lips trembled

  you shall not suffer alone-you
shall not philip she said ecstatically

  he loosened the storm on her with-
out warning

  i wouldnt suffer alone-thats the
trouble he said coolly bracing himself
the youngest of the mcmahons



for the lie he was to tell i wouldnt
-thats the trouble theres my wife
and children-my dear little ones two
lovely little girls down in idaho

   she started back with face abashed
her body seemed to shrink she be-
came suddenly wilted and forlorn all
in a second her wonderful romance was
shattered by a lie as big as it was use-
ful on hearing it the warder fell back
from the door in a fit of laughter phil
regarded his visitor mournfully

    its for them i feel you see he
said theyre all ive got i need to
be braced thats why the new baptist
minister is cornin to-day have you
met him he added

  she shook her head mournfully
hes only just come to askatoon
she murmured

  hes young and good-looking-
about thirty-two and i like his talk
phil continued hes not too religious
he puts things without licking his
chops-dye see

  she nodded sorrowfully for she had
been sorely hit yet she was interested
the new baptist minister had only been
in askatoon a very short time when
he learned that phil had said he was
a baptist when asked his religion by the
sheriff he had gone at once to the jail
and he was again waiting now outside
the cell

  he wont have much of a living in
askatoon phil remarked with careful
sympathy in his voice and priscilla
raised her head a little for now a faint
spirit of fresh adventure came into her
eye a new good-looking baptist min-
ister-and poor one romance had
just been slain but as though provi-
dence had stooped to bring comfort to
her here was the faint vision of an-
other

  hed be better if he was married
reflected phil he could do more
good hes coming to pray with me
hes waitin outside now i expect
time said the warder at the door
to priscilla

  bring in the sky-pilot warder
said phil

yv moment later the reverend
enoch milton was in the cell a
lean affectionate soulful-looking man

who looked a fit companion for pris-
cilla meekin phil introduced them

  one of our heiresses of askatoon
mr milton he said shes done me
real good i got to say it shes always
thinkin of others

  he gave a swift and unnecessary de-
scription of the incident of running her
down in the street of his going to jail
and of her subsequent holy work
as he called it

  doin good-always doin good he
added im a baptist if im any-
thing but it didnt make no difference
to her shed have spent her fortune
on me and now since i killed short-
horn the man that insulted her-of
course youve heard he added

  i have heard-indeed i have heard
unctuously remarked the reverend
enoch milton

  time said the warder peremp-
torily

  shake hands you two people who
go about doin good said phil

  this was done with real and prim-
itive eloquence the reverend enoch
milton was thinking of what acquaint-
ance with an heiress might mean and
as for priscilla when she fluttered from
the cell there was the light of a new
romance in her eyes she even gave
the warder a dollar-which showed
how much she was moved

  shes a wonder that girl-a prize
and so holy phil watched her go
with benevolent satisfaction

  a true handmaid of the lord
answered the reverend enoch milton

v

the country around askatoon was
particularly fertile this was
due so said some drv-as-dust
scientific men to the fact that the river
at askatoon had in the past overflowed
its banks and like the nile had de-
posited good nourishing deposits of the
hills from which it came the scien-
tists further added that there had been
recent deposits and that the river
would probably overflow its banks
again such statements made very
little impression upon askatoon be-
cause in the first place the scientists


the blue book magazine

did not look like practical knowledg-
able men and secondly because not in
the memory of the oldest indian had
there been a great flooding of the
river though the indians had legends
of flights of the tribe from the
sudden overflow of the banks of
the mattalan

  there was only one person in the
town who took both the scientists and
the indian legend seriously and that
was the young doctor he was abso-
lutely certain that the river had over-
flowed within the memory of the living
indians were migratory and the tribe
now in the reservation at askatoon
might very likely have been five hun-
dred or a thousand miles away when
the last flood occurred he spoke his
mind about it in the early days of the
place and urged building the town on
the rise above the lowest level of the
prairie without avail

  nothing had happened to justify his
fear nevertheless the flood came
like a thief in the night

  there had been two days rain and
the river had risen then there had
been sunshine again but the river
remained still within a dozen inches ot
the bank yet one morning before
daybreak there was loud crying in
askatoon and people scrambled out of
their beds into their doorways to hear
the alarm rung by the bells of the
churches and the shouts of people in
trouble the mattalan had over-
flowed its banks according to the
prophecy of the scientists

yorning broke upon a town
 almost deserted as most of the
population had stampeded to the up-
land taking little with them in one
of the driest places of the west every
individual and separate house was now
an island streets were canals women
and children were crying from upper
windows boats-and there were very
few-were passing here and there res-
cuing and bringing food and clothes to
the refugees a tew people who lived
on the opposite side of the river from
askatoon were safe as there the bank
was several feet higher than on the
askatoon side it was on the farther
side that tannahill and his daughter

eileen lived they were safe at least
they could see the cattle carried away
by the flood-also barns and outhouses
which had had no foundations

  askatoon never showed to belter ad-
vantage than in this first crisis of its
existence men like jonas ijillings
were tireless in their efforts to save
people and were full of resource
cheering and comforting they slaved
without ceasing and only two lives
were lost-those of little children it
was a time of mutual help of bravery
and of good organization which was
practically controlled by the young
doctor the mayor being absent from
the town

  yet in spite of organization one spot
was forgotten nobody thought of the
jail it was not on the lowest ground
of the town it stood somewhat apart
nearer to the channel of the river it
was naturally thought-if there was
any thought at all-that the officials of
the jail would look after their own par-
ticular population as it happened
however the sheriff was absent from
the place the deputy-sheriff in his ex-
citement in the early morning having
nothing to eat drank whisky and be-
came intoxicated and two of the ward-
ers forsook llieir posts to look after
their own families who were living in
the town

  in the great excitement phil mc-
mahon begged permission to assist in
the rescue work promising on his word
of honor to return and being refused
fell upon his warder laid him out
senseless abstracted his keys and es-
caped from jail taking to the water
with unerring instinct he swam toward
the farther shore in the direction of
tannahills farm having taken off his
boots and hung them around his neck

  as he made his way through the
 flood here and there able to walk
he felt pleased with himself this was
the kind of thing that added interest
to existence he passed a crowded
boat which hailed him and was told
that practically everybody was safe
the melancholy of the outlook all
around him did not overwhelm him
cattle were floating down the main cur-
rent of the river trees and brushwood
the youngest of the mcmahons



swept by the outhouses on which
small animals found refuge slowly
moved past overhead the sun was sinn-
ing brightly while all round the horizon
great piles of clouds were scattering
and breaking-the last fringes of the
storm in the mountains and the foot-
hills which had made the peaceful mat-
talan a savage destroyer of homes

  suddenly he heard a cry in the dis-
tance behind him he turned round
a man in a boat flourishing a rifle was
calling upon him to stay his course
by this time he had just come to the
main current of the river he paid no
attention to the summons which came
from the warder whom lie had over-
powered in his cell and now faithful
to his duty was trying to recapture his
prisoner a shot was fired but the
bullet went wide and then the warder
settled down to row making unskillful
use of the oars however in spite of
that he gained on phil and would have
overtaken him in due course had he
not by unshipping an oar through acci-
dent been caught by a flood-tree at
the same time striking some under-
water obstruction which overturned his
boat at the moment he was but a few
hundred feet from phil who seeing
the accident swam back caught by
the tree the warder who could not
swim was in imminent danger of
drowning

  ensued the interesting situation of a
prisoner saving his jailer from a watery
grave and with great difficulty keeping
him up while he endeavored to swim
to the opposite shore the current im-
peding him the chances were terribly
against his making it unless he aban-
doned the warder to his fate that
might have to be done since it was
better that one should drown than both
but phil was not the man to save him-
self so long as there was a chance of
saving anyone else

  he would not have been able to do
that however had it not been for
eileen tannahill from the opposite
shore she had seen phil take to the
water from the window of the sheriffs
office in the jail she had seen him mak-
ing for the shore where she was and
before the warders boat had over-
turned she had already seated herself

in a heavy indian canoe and struck out
from the bank instinct told her the
whole situation when she had seen the
shot fired by the warder and when phil
turned back to rescue his jailer a thrill
of admiration and pride possessed her
why should she be proud somehow
she had a feeling for phil not founded
on an understanding established be-
tween them on the fateful day when
sam shorthorn had been killed by the
man now struggling to save the life of
another

  hes a wonder hes a wonder-oh
dear why doesnt he let go the warder
she exclaimed as she paddled hard

  no one else would do it and thats
why-why-

  she broke off sharply something
was stirring her more than the excite-
ment of the rescue she was attempt-
ing

che reached the two only just in
time there was no chance of get-
ting either into the canoe with a word
of warning followed by a word of
greeting she laid her canoe alongside
phil whose chin was only just above
water

  the warning was not needed phil
had no intention of clutching at the
canoe and overturning it his hand
caught the stem of it he got it firmly
in his grip and with cheerful splutter-
ing bade eileen go ahead

  even now with the greatest diffi-
culty he supported the warder yet
phils indomitable optimism his refusal
to see the bad end to anything enabled
him even to make a joke as they moved
slowly toward the bank

pull for the shore sailor

pull for the shore-

he spluttered gayly to eileen

  and so at last the bank was reached
and old brick tannahill and a couple
of other men with the assistance of
pike-poles-the hooks catching in the
warders uniform-were able to land
the insensible official

  as for phil relieved of his burden
his strength came back and with an
effort at jauntiness he almost sprang
ashore his boots were still around
his neck


the blue book magazine

  id shake hands with you if i
wasnt so wet he said to eileen

  the tears started to eileens eyes
impulsively she caught both his hands

in hers

  they ought to give you a gold medal
and put up a statue lo you she said

  phil laughed theyll put a broad-
arrow on my clothes if they get a
chance he returned and theyll take
care of me at goverment expense for
ten years mebbe isnt that enough
well itll certainly be enough if  let
em but im off im off ive broke
jail and ill watch them catching me
again i dont think but theres my
friend the warder to he looked after
first he added and he turned to where
tannahill and the two men were work-
ing the warders arms up and down in
an effort to restore him to conscious-
ness

a fter a moment tannahill ex-
claimed excitedly hes cornin
back his eyes are open halleluyeh
his eyes are open aw hes breathin
aw here the fellas back again safe
and sound heres to ye mr warder
tis in the land of the livin yare
now where did ye think ye were with
that look in yer eyes yere in the
land of livin im tellin ye

  the warder looked round dazedly
then his eyes fixed upon phil i owe
it to you he said feebly but i fired
wide-honest i did he said

  phil nodded thats all right he
replied and-good day old locksman
say i got to go this aint no place
for me he turned to eileen well
ill be back with thanks to you by and
by he continued theres a horse
here thatll do the trick for me ill
see you get it back he added to tan-
nahill as he pointed lo a sturdy little
indian pony saddled and bridled
tethered near by

   why should ye be off demanded
tannahill indignantly havent ye
saved the warder here hasnt he said
so back he is in the land of the livin
and whos done it

  your daughters done it and shes
done it in style replied phil getting

into his boots if it hadnt been for

her-

  thats all very fine-i think we
know all about it remarked eileen
gently give yourself some credit
please you need it after whats hap-
pened take all you can get-and come
back some day youll be welcome

  come back exclaimed tannahill
vigorously how can they jail him
now  what sam shorthorn got he de-
served  what the warder heres got he
didnt deserve firing at a man in the
water-think of that sure wouldnt
the law make the balance between the
two

im not taking any chances i guess
i got to go answered phil decisively

  the law is the law said the warder
making a feeble effort to rise there
was warning in his voice it was as
though he meant to take phil into
charge yet it was plain also from his
face that he wished him to go it was
his duty to take phil back to jail but
he wanted to avoid it ive got to take
you back he persisted the laws
the law

  dont trouble to rise said phil
dryly rest when you can and bless
the lord for all his mercies but ill
be gettin on he nodded toward the
pony is it a go he asked tanna-
hill ill give you fifty dollars for it
if it doesnt get back

  tannahill nodded never mind
about the fifty take the cayuse

  i cant hold you said the warder
im too weak

  dont you try old boy remarked
phil ironically he caught the warders
hand for an instant theres no
strength in yr grip he said tell
the sheriff its up to him now ive
done my part by the jail then he
turned to eileen mebbe ill find you
here when i get back he added
smiling his eyes had a meaning look
and she understood and was glad

  youd better come back soon she
said

  i dont wish him no bad luck said
the warder warmly a moment after-
wards as phil cantered away on the
cayuse in the burning heat of noon

ee ejaculated euphemia
regan as the door of the
board-room closed behind the
last of the association mem-
bers gee theyre an elegant bunch 
will you tell me how theyre ever going
to make a gentlemens agreement

  miss regan wrinkled her nice nose
scornfully as she spoke and with a
vicious stab thrust the pencil that she
had just sharpened into a coil of her
plentiful golden hair her friend and
co-laborer sadie sanders nodded ac-
quiescence and stripping the foil from
a package of gum she tossed a stick to
the golden-haired one

  bite on that dearie and you wont
wear the edges off your teeth she
advised

  euphemia took the gum and the ad-
vice and then deftly inserting a sheet
of paper in her machine began to type



form-letter a at top speed miss
sanders busied herself in like manner
and for several minutes nothing was
heard but the clean staccato of the keys
under their nimble fingers then the
door of the inner room opened and let
out a burst of loud guffaws together
with willie the office-boy who was
grinning widely and doubling himself
with mirth as he came

  that was a peach gurgled willie
as soon as he had closed the door
want me to tell it to you girls

  you dare to and ill slap you
dizzy warned miss sanders with an
earnestness that evidently impressed the
youth gway you imp and get busy
or ill report you to mr wenlock
-aint the male sex the limit she con-
tinued appealing to euphemia even
an infant in arms like that

  they give me sharp darting pains in


the blue book magazine

the back of my neck agreed eu-
phemia they were four days in ses-
sion last quarterly four two-hour
days and the tiredest lot of business
men that ever sagged into a front-row
seat at a musical comedy talk about
reporting id like to report them to
their home towns-and their trusting
wives ugh

  maybe they havent all got trusting
wives suggested miss sadie

  well i wouldnt undertake to say
about the trusting part miss euphe-
raia conceded theyre all married
though

  how do you know dearie 
euphemia smiled a mona lisa
smile how long have you been sten-
ogging in this bustling little burg she
inquired if you cant pick em by
this time youd better get back to the
sheltered life

  theres riggs-the detroit man
sure he doesnt count though
he aint a human being and theres
whatshisname from keokuk i dont
count him either hes fairly decent
i heard some of them talking about his
engagement about time at that
how about the one they call dick-
luttrell  none of the earmarks about
him and you cant say hes fresh
miss sanders looked mischievously at
her friend who slipped another sheet
of paper into her machine and began
to write with an air of great concen-
tration she stopped at the first line
however

  ive got his number she mur-
mured-and then with an access of
energy theyve got on my nerves
the leering fat-headed old frauds id
like to- she bit her ruddy under-
lip and made another spirited attack
upon her machine miss sanders
watched her for a moment smiling and
then with a half-suppressed giggle
turned to her own work

t may have been horatio j joplin
the member from silsbury indiana
who had particularly got on euphemias
nerves the rest of them seemed in-
offensive enough even if they did take
notice of the extremely personable
stenographer it may be here men-
tioned that miss sanders herself was

as johnson of racine expressed it no
revolting spectacle but undoubtedly
miss regan was unusual

  the trouble with mr joplin of sils-
bury was that his face was too pink and
his eyes too little and slitty also his
neck overflowed his collar and his
waistcoat was grossly protuberant in its
lower region euphemia might have
pardoned that if he had not made a
point of stopping at her desk on his
way to and from the board-room and
trying to be conversational during
the last quarterly session he had com-
plained to her most pathetically of his
loneliness in the big city-particularly
in the evenings-and told her how
gratefully he would appreciate the char-
ity of bright youthful companionship
euphemia had looked at him with her
clear and candid irish blue eyes-eyes
of a glacial clearness and blueness and
a contemptuous candor-and remarked
that he should have brought his family
with him but you might hire one of
the bright young bell-hops at the hotel
to talk to you when you get too
lonesome she suggested and added
-if you paid him enough

  expense wouldnt be any object
mr joplin had said eut its a belle
i want not a bell-hop

  i wish you had one long enough to
ring off euphemia had replied

  that was a little discouraging but
mr joplin was not altogether discour-
aged for only two days after he had
come to the office rather late and laid
a two-pound box of candy on her desk
sweets to the sweet he had observed
originally with a greasy smile that al-
most obliterated his eyes then he had
passed on to the meeting in the inner
office five minutes later willie the
office boy had come into the board-
room bearing the opened box which
he passed around the big table begin-
ning with the president

  mr joplins treat willie had ex-
plained grinning and that little inci-
dent actually had discouraged mr jop-
lin for the remainder of the session
but he seemed to be beginning again

pleven-thirty there was a
stir in the board-room and then the
door opened and the members flocked
a hairbreadth scape for euphemia 

out some talking with the intense
seriousness demanded by questions of
business interest and some with the
boisterous jocularity of schoolboys
newly released from intellectual occu-
pation altogether they were a fine
representative lot of business men well
groomed well clad and with a few dys-
peptic exceptions well fed they all
made for the long hat-rack that flanked
the stenographers desks the lockers
were for the regular office force and
donning hats and coats straggled out
by twos and threes mr joplin settled
a glossy silk hat on his sleek pear-
shaped head but removed it with a
flourish as he paused by miss regans
desk

  and how are the young ladies stand-
ing the fatigue of the mornings la-
bors he inquired with a smirk

  he addressed himself to miss san-
ders but his little eyes shifted to eu-
phemia who was laboring without any
sign of fatigue whatsoever

  fainting for food miss sanders
responded with a long-drawn sigh
did you notice it were you going
to ask us-but no it cannot be

  it could be said mr joplin
anywhere you say and whatever you
like how about it miss regan he
looked at euphemia hopefully

  the clicking of euphemias machine
stopped abruptly as she arched her eye-
brows and smiled at the portly joplin
and any time we say she asked
the surest thing you know
euphemia turned to her friend
lets do sade she said and as mr
joplins smirk broadened she contin-
ued this is february twenty-fifth
spose we take mr joplin up and make
a date with him for the thirty-first
couldnt suit me better replied
miss sanders reely its the only
evening i aint spoke for

  same here said euphemia the
thirty-first of this month then mr
joplin well be duh-lighted

  joplins pink deepened and his smirk
stiffened until it became absolutely
rigid he bent over euphemias desk
and waggled a fat forefinger at her
naughty he whispered hoarsely
naughty	j

  you dont happen to have such a

thing as an egg about you do you
euphemia asked coldly

  she thinks you might be able to
beat it if you had miss sanders
explained

  just then mr richard luttrell of
birmingham alabama appeared at mr
joplins elbow one of the youngest
members of the association sir lut-
trell but arrived and still going strong
core-boy helper puddler molder fore-
man and finally independent founder
he had supplemented the industrious
work of his hands by remarkably judi-
cious headwork and his rise had been
rapid he was not quite so natty as
most of his associates and his big
sinewy hands and finger-nails clean an
well tended as they now were still
showed marks made by the pinch of
castings and grubbing for jaggers in
those early days of his apprenticeship
he was further distinguished from the
present quorum by an athletic build and
a complexion neither too florid nor
pasty his eyes were brown set well
apart and usually harboring a twinkle
although just then they were somber
enough as a general thing too he
smiled easily a quick illuminating smile
in pleasant contrast with his normally
grave expression but while his voice
sounded passably good-natured he did
not smile as he gripped mr joplins
arm

  going my way joplin he in-
quired briskly come along with
which he propelled mr joplin to the
door out into the corridor and into an
already crowded elevator that was just
closing its gates

  ill take the next down joppy he
called as the elevator descended but
he turned away almost as he spoke and
reentered the office miss sanders saw
him and smiled at him with friendly
approval euphemia saw him too and
gave him a rapid and very stony glance
upon which mr luttrell murmured
oh well-one might say sighed-
and went back to the elevator he saw
nothing of mr joplin in the lobby but
he hardly expected to

vtf hats eating you phemie in-
quired mis sanders as mr lut-
trells broad shoulders vanished


the blue boof magazine

 what do you meao demanded
euphemia crossly

 the gentmun from alabama i
thought you were strong for him but
he seems to have got in bad with you
somehow and hes all broke up about
it if you should ask me

  trying to kid somebody aint you
said euphemia

 oh i dont know replied her
friend did you get that look of dumb
anguish when you put him on long-
distance well i did and if sobbing
in office hours wasnt against the rules
id be soaking up my handkerchief with
salty tears right now

 chop it snapped euphemia

  oh vurry well but if you aint got
any further use for him im not too
proud to do my little best theres
many a heart is caught on the rebound
and ive got a fair catching average
mself

  you dont need to jump for a foul
said euphemia look here she
glanced around the office and then
opened the drawer of her desk and
fished out a folded sheet of note-paper
covered with writing in an angular
feminine hand miss sanders took it
and read as follows

  -forget little eddies shoes and be
  sure to get them at kinder  gartens
  and if you see a nice little silk szveater
  -garnet and eight-year-old she-for
  phsiebe i wish youd get it with the
  understanding that i can return it
  there isnt a thing in the shops here
  and the poor child will he so disap-
  pointed if you come back without it
  kinder  gartens remember mead-
  ows might have one but everything
  we have got at k  gs for the chil-
  dren has been so satisfactory dick
  boy it doesnt seem like home without-

 miss sanders handed the note back
aint that the limit she exclaimed
indignantly

  i guess hes within his rights said
euphemia indifferently being a mar-
ried man is no crime

 just a misfortune i suppose hed
say sneered miss sanders but
when they make out theyre carefree
bachelors and-

  mr luttrell never gave out that he
was single euphemia interrupted
hastily til say that for him and he
never acted like anything but a gentle-

man i hadnt got any reason to

think- she stopped and something
in her face made sadie hasten to change
the subject but she recurred to it

later being human

  where did you get that note she
asked maybe it belongs to some of
the ohers old wingates name is
richard

  i-i saw him drop it euphemia
answered -out of his pocket

  whynt you tell him he dropped
it

  well replied euphemia defiantly
how could i tell for certain it was his
without reading it it wasnt in an

envelope

wir richard luttrell found
va he needed some cigars and being
rather particular about the quality of
the tobacco that he smoked he took
plenty of time to make his selection at
the lobby cigar-stand incidentally he
entered into conversation with the pro-
prietor of the stand finding a starting
topic of interest in the dccline of the
pittsburgh stogie in spite of his in-
terest he kept the tail of his eye on the
elevators and did not fail to notice when
mesdemoiselles regan and sanders
came down although he did not look at
them openly

  well he observed to the cigar man
as the young women left the building-
and the remark may have been a mere
coincidence-well this wont buy the
baby shoes

  as soon as he was outside he
glanced up and down the street and
caught sight of euphemias black vel-
vet beaver-fur-trimmed toque bobbing
southward but alas sadies putty-
gray hatters-plush sailor was bobbing
companionably along beside it and he
decided that under the circumstances
he would ask miss regan for an ex-
planation on some other occasion but
he meant to have that explanation
when a girl has always shown herself
friendly to a man and when she
suddenly and without any earthly
reason becomes blankly oblivious of his
existence or at the best acknowledges
it grudgingly and with chilling disap-
proval-then certainly a man is entitled
to know the reason why
a hairbreadth scape for euphemia 

  iiut the moment for demanding that
reason was clearly inopportune and so
m  ivhard luttrell turned northward
a id then eastward to state street and
locating kinder  gartens bought the
baby shoes

out of the tail of her eye euphemia
had not failed to notice mr lut-
trell at the cigar-stand if she had
overlooked him sadies sharp pinch
would have properly directed her atten-
tion but euphemia expected that the
alabama man would be sticking around
and sadie was with her to render the
sticking futile it was against her
preference really that euphemia pres-
ently found herself lunching in stog-
gins cafeteria though sadie was a
daily habitue of stoggins

  and youll come again to-morrowr
wont you asked sadie

  not after that though sade eu-
phemia answered

  being as to-morrow is the last of
the session i spose

  i dont get you said euphemia
and it was an untruthful thing to say

  but the next mornings meeting was
to be the last of the special session and
that suggested another idea to miss
sanders with much giggling she
broached it when they got back to the
office and it is fair to say that eu-
phemia objected

  i thought you were aching to frame
up something on them sadie observed
scornfully you need a charcoal stove
for your feet

  you need something for your head
euphemia retorted

  listen phemie the other urged
nobodys going to know a thing about
it-ever the deenoomong is sprung
in their happy homes-see and the
next meeting theyll get together at
eight a m and adjourn sine die at six
with a sessions work done meantime
their wives will do a little chicago shop-
ping phemie youve gotta come in on
this youve gotta

  i dont see where i come in any-
way said euphemia relenting never-
theless

  if t had your yellow mop you
wouldnt have to but im brown-
haired and brown hair stands for

wifely devotion and  the domestic
virtues you havent read much if you
dont know that i bet you mrs joplin
has brown hair and a low gentle voice
oh fudge brown wouldnt be no-
ticed in the first place and it would be
all right if it was hubby would just
stall about the way she sheds it no
dearie yours is the real siren shade-
the genuine trouble-breeding vampire
hank

  much obliged but ill fool you just
the same you must think im easy
it wont hurt le me show you
mr wenlock had gone home and
they were practically alone in the ante-
room so sadie showed euphemia and
euphemia cried ouch

  i got hold of three at once ex-
plained sadie contritely now keep
still there that didnt hurt did it
not more than pulling a tooth eu-
phemia replied sarcastically but she
submitted and it was quite a sizable
hank that miss sanders locked in her
desk about five minutes later

tthere was no apparent necessity
for chaperonage that evening sa-
die boarded an ashland avenue car
euphemia lived with her aunt norah
in a small north avenue flat near wells
street and so they only walked together
for a couple of blocks it was a cold
wet evening with a threat of snow in
the flurries of rain and euphemia had
to struggle to keep her inadequate um-
brella at a protective angle she was
so occupied with this that mr joplin
had to cough two or three times and
finally take her by the arm before she
became aware of his presence

  she disengaged her arm with a auick
jerk when she saw who it was and the
look that he got ought to have been
enough for him but it was not he
only leered at her

  gd evenin liie bright-eyes said
he clipping his words curiously and
speaking with a certain huskiness
whither way he repossessed
himself of her arm and this time eu-
phemia knew that she was not going to
shake him off easily she saw that his
face was very red and he was close
enough to allow her to analyze his
breath this did not alarm her-to

speak of-but she was distinctly
annoyed

  til be obliged to you if you  let go
of me and chase yourself she said as
calmly as she was able deeming plain
language best	

  -anything in world tblige you
cepin that said joplin two
mbrels not nessry put yours down
and cmup close uiid mine no puj
mine down then and come close und
yours where you think you going to
kid   

  im going to my car euphemia
answered with rising indignation see
here mr joplin  know youre not
yourself so you might as well try to be
a gentleman if you dont let me go
im going to slap you and then have you
arrested right here

  bluff joplin chuckled hoarsely
and he was right about that euphe-
mia had a sharp tongue upon occasion
indeed she had found it indispensable
but in spite of that and her always
assured manner she was as modestly
pverse from a street scene as any
shrinking young highly-cultivated crea-
ture secluded in a ladies seminary at
that moment all her fortitude could not
keep the tears from her eyes

  bluff joplin repeated and
youve got it wrong about that car no
night fr young girlsh in stree-carsh
lile dinner comfly with y uncle dud-
ley attagirl tackshy home been
waiting all aft-

they were crossing the intersection
of an alley and joplin seemed to
stumble on its rough paving relinquish-
ing his clasp of her arm euphemia
instantly quickened her pace almost to
a run but at the same moment she cast
a frightened look backward and saw
to her astonishment there was no jop-
lin behind her he had vanished

  yet not altogether perhaps for she
had a fleeting glimpse of a figure that
might have been his it was hard to
tell though for another figure was im-
mediately behind it and the alley
quickly swallowed both in its gloom
nor did euphemia linger but made
what speed she might to her car corner
there however she was obliged to
wait there were a dozen others wait-

ing and when the second overflowing

car had passed euphemia recovering
from her natural agitation surveyed
them casually then she had a re-
lapse

  not mr joplin this time but mr
luttrell he was standing within ten
feet of her apparently as ignorant of
her proximity as she had been of his
he carried no umbrella but wore a
rain-coat and a cloth hat with its brim
well pulled down and looked quite equal
to resisting the elements one thing
euphemia noticed that his rain-coat-
a new and expensive-looking garment-
was torn a long strip of the cloth with
a button attached dangling from his
breast below the collar-fastening ob-
viously this was the result of a recent
accident euphemia  caught herself
wondering wrhy he had not pinned it
up what could he be doing here 

  another car came up and euphemia
was aboard of it before it had fairly
stopped making her way through the
rear-platform jam with an insinuating
skill due to long practice she secured a
strap just inside the door the next
moment luttrell swung to the step and
the car moved on

  they were at chicago avenue before
euphemia ventured another glance at
him he was on the platform now
standing half a head at least above the
rest and yet she almost persuaded her-
self that he had not seen her he
seemed unusually grave almost stem
just as he had looked when she first
noticed him at the comer several
times after that euphemia looked at
him-quickly and furtively at first but
soon with a more sustained regard yet
not once did she detect anything in his
expression to indicate that he was
aware of her his face was half
averted but only as he happened to be
standing-not purposely she was sure
but at north avenue he turned and
unhesitatingly jumped off the car and
when she struggled out to the step he
was waiting to help her to descend

m ow said luttrell coolly as they
  crossed the street now youre
going to tell me whats the matter let
me take that umbrella first

  i dont know what you mean mr
a hairbreadth scape for euphemia 

luttrell i euphemias heart was beat-
ing fast but her tone was as cool and
matter-of-fact as his own-and she al-
lowed him to take the umbrella it was
still blowing hard but he held it quite
easily against the wind

  yes you do he contradicted
bluntly whats the matter miss
regan 

  why are you following me this
way euphemia flared out

  to ask you that question you
havent given me any other chance
whats the matter miss regan 
nothings the matter euphemia
snapped now that ive answered
your question perhaps youll let me
take my umbrella and leave me alone
in a gentler tone she added i didnt
think this of you mr luttrell

  dont get me wrong said luttrell
earnestly i certainly wouldnt want
to pester you but i thought- we
seemed to be on friendly terms but
lately- if i have done anything to
offend you i havent meant to i know
that i want to be-friends miss
regan wont you tell me please-
how did you tear your coat  asked
euphemia

  luttrell looked down at the dangling
strip and was clearly surprised i
didnt know it was torn he said but
i reckon that hasnt anything to do with
the question

  again euphemia broke out angrily
why is it that you gentlemen think
that any girl who works for her liv-
ing- this is the second time this eve-
ning mr joplin-

  mr joplin wont bother you any
more i promise you that interrupted
luttrell grimly and im sorry to
have you even me with trash like him
miss regan did i ever act up like
him

  no euphemia admitted you
havent mr luttrell dont begin
now and let it go at that

they had reached the entrance to
the modest little flat-building where
euphemia lived and she ran quickly up
the steps and into the shelter of the
vestibule luttrell deliberately closed
her umbrella shook it and then fol-
lowed her give me a minute please

he said he smiled for the first time
and euphemia wished he wouldnt be-
cause when he smiled it was hard-oh
very hard-to feel what it was proper
to feel under the circumstances

  then if i havent done anything
were friends again

  why-yes euphemia faltered
she almost took his extended hand but
the proper feeling came on her with a
rush no she said with spirit were
not friends and were not going to be
what do you want with my friendship
why dont you amuse yourself with
girls of your own class oh i know 

  luttrell laughed honestly amused
my own class  he exclaimed why
girl theres no class to me thats the
trouble with me i guess im plain as
an old shoe-just home folks miss
regan

  euphemias eyes sparkled with anger
home folks she echoed with bitter
emphasis yes i know you are
well if you ask me i think youd better
go home-and stay there

  she almost whirled to the door
opened it and darted up the stairs the
door swung back and its latch clicked
viciously

  luttrell stood staring blankly for a
full minute and then reluctantly left the
building he almost slouched back to
clark street and it may also be said
that he looked the foiled villain to a
marvel

  didnt make much by that he
muttered

it was quite evident the next morning
 that euphemia had caught cold in
the rain her eyes showed it and so
did the swollen condition of her nice
little nose sadie was all sympathy and
immediately produced a menthol in-
haler for present relief and euphemia
was obligingly sniffing at it when the
members of the association began to
arrive then she took up her work
and at once proved that the unpleasant
malady had not affected her fingers
she was so intent upon what she was
doing that she noticed neither mr lut-
trells arrival nor mr joplins failure
to arrive sadie presently informed her
of the latter circumstance

  all here but him she said dole-


the blue book magazine

fully the curtain up and all set for
the play and no hamlet wouldnt
that jar your sensibilities but cheer
up she continued hopefully maybe
liell come in after a while staggering
under a load of hot-house flowers
still we wont wait for him

  she took something from her desk
and was starting for thecoat-rack when
euphemia called to her iay off that
sade she said sharply  wont stand
for it bring that hair
back here

  miss sanders stopped
and then seeing that
her friend was in
earnest stuck out her
tongue and began to
busy herself among the
coats

  oh well said eu-
phemia with a sort of
listless resignation she
went on with her work
but in a moment or two
she straightened up and
beckoned imperatively

sade

  as sadie refused to come she got
up and went to her dont put any in
mr luttrells coat anyway she re-
quested earnestly

  sadie gave her a queer look which
is his coat she asked and euphemia
pointed it out-a shaggy ulster

  just as you say sadie consented
and euphemia went back to her desk
and paid no further attention to the
matter sadie resented that euphe-
mia was not acting in a sportsmanlike
manner she considered leaving it all
to her nevertheless she went on with
it zestfully and she did it artistically-
not so that the long golden hairs would
be at once perceived but that from their
concealment beneath coat-collars in
sleeve-linings behind lapels and under
pocket-flaps they would in time work
out to the confusion of those who had
unknowingly harbored them and she
put an extra allowance in and about the
haggy ulster belonging to mr richard
luttrell

cm even-thirty arrived out
came the victims but they did not
as mcsdemoiselles sanders and regan

cxpected linger to exchange hand-
shakes and farewells that was the
usual thing at the end of a session but
now the members assumed their coats
and hats without any indication that
they were parting to meet no more until
the first monday in april and pres-
ently amid the babble arose the voice
of legette of marion

  you can make the six-thirty easy
enough peterson well be all through
here by four oclock
the young women
looked at one another in
consternation gee 
whispered sadie
theyre coming back
this afternoon

  it was only too true
willie the office-boy
confirmed it some little
measure was still to be
debated and voted upon
-little but important

  cant be helped
said sadie and maybe
it wont make any dif-
ference anyway well hope so

  but it did make a decided difference
for the afternoon debate had not begun
when riggs of detroit discovered a
long golden hair on mr luttrells
shoulder and gleefully proclaimed his
discover euphemia and sadie heard
the jovial uproar that ensued and
their faces blanched with apprehen-
sion presently the board-room door
opened and disclosed mr riggs who
held his closed finger and thumb
delicately before him he looked
narrowly at miss regan-at her
coiffure particularly-and a roseate
flood of color overspread miss regans
attractive young face whereupon
riggs grinned broadly and withdrew
closing the door carefully again
noisy laughter and above it luttrelfs
voice in sharp remonstrance com-
parative silence then but only for a
minute somebody uttered a yell of
delight and shouted heres one on
bristow too and another burst of
laughter greeted the announcement

  euphemia started up nearly over-
turning her chair and hurried to her
locker in record time she jammed
the beaver-trimmed toque down atop

of her shining tresses pinned it and
slipped into her coat her face was
still crimson and she dabbed quickly
at her eyes with her handkerchief
before she slammed the locker door-
at which instant sadie came up sadie
was thoroughly alarmed

  where are you going dearie

 im going home euphemia
answered with an effort to control her
emotion you can say that i am sick
-and you bet i am oh see what
youve done

  but dearie-

  euphemia broke from her detaining
hand and fled

in the parlor of mrs hennesseys
select boarding-house on ashland
avenue sadie sanders that evening
related the story of the following events
to mr art brenker who was lucky
enough to be her steady company

  i was sorry for the poor kid said
sadie but believe me i was some
twittered when i thought of what was
going to happen to little me mr wen-
lock our manager is easy dispositioned
most of the time but when he
gets sore he aint got no more chivalry
than a rabbit and i didnt lose time
getting to those coats to gather up the
circumstantial evidence but no i
hadnt picked half a dozen hairs when
out he comes and im caught in the
act he just looks at me like a wooden
injun for about an hour and three-
quarters-it might have been less but
thats my guess then he asks me where
is euphemia and i tell him shes gone
home with the lagrippe

   a very good place for her says
he and walks up to the coat-rack and
begins investigating what were you
doing here just now miss sanders

  picking em off says i it was
me put em on i says nobly

  oh did you indeed he says-
just like that did you indeed
willie come here and carry these coats
into the board-room he takes an
armful himself and willie takes the
rest when he comes back he fires me
in a few well-chosen words so here i
am

  i should worry  said art happily
kiddo how long is it going to take you

to get good and ready ill give you
till the day after to-morrow morning

  make it a week from now and
youre on was miss sadies blushing
response but art dear dont you
never think that two can live as cheap
as one this recklessness is going to
put an awful crimp in your pay-
envelope

  a little later sadie said i feel mean
about euphemia it aint the job so
much because she can get another
most anywhere but its that skate
luttrell i was telling you about art
the cold gray dawn will soon be break-
ing and this has been my busy day so
im going to let you go and treat mself
to-to-a n-nice little w-weep

puphemias cold was worse the
next morning her eyes her aunt
nora told her were like two burned
holes in a blanket and her nose a
sight to behold going to the office
was out of the question euphemia
agreed that it was out of the question
sadie having acquainted her by tele-
phone with what had transpired there
so she kept her room and submitted to
aunt noras ministrations it wras hard
to be obliged to lie and think and fight
against thinking and then think again
all through the day with no other dis-
traction than quinine capsules herb tea
and beef broth there was so much to
think of that hurt it was not as sadie
had said so much the loss of her posi-
tion yet that was to be considered
but that humiliation of the after-
noon before her body tingled with
the shameful recollection

  and she had laid herself open to it
sadie had proposed the mischief but
she euphemia had consented to it it
had even seemed quite justifiable to her
at the time aside from the joke of it
now the thing appeared in its true
light-an unmaidenly folly whose
consequences might have been serious
enough those men were not all jop-
lins some of them were decent so far
as she really knew that was a bitter
thought too and she had to think of
it

  but as sadie had said it wasnt so
much that as that skate luttrell and
the worst of it was euphemia had


the blue book magazine

come to the conclusion that he was not
a skate she had fancied admiration
in his eyes-or something more-
when it was nothing hut pure kindliness
and good nature thinking it over
it was not until she found that note and
basely read it that she had really
thought- and now oh why was he so
tail and strong and why did he smile
in that quick sunshiny way and let
that little twinkle come into his eyes
even when he seemed most grave  and
why did she so like to hear him laugh
or speak when-

  hard to be obliged to lie and think

  the day went somehow once dur-
ing aunt noras absence for neces-
sary marketing euphemia went to the
telephone and called up the office ed
rogers one of the clerks answered the
call and told her that mr wenlock was
out

  will you please tell him that im
not able to get down to the office and
that he had better please get some-
body in my place say im sorry
please mr rogers and-have they got
through with the session

  got through yesterday afternoon
miss regan rogers answered they
are all home by this time is there any-
thing i can do

  thank you very much said eu-
phemia -just the message to mr
wenlock thats all

  thats settled said euphemia to
herself i couldnt go back

mext morning euphemia decided

    she would start out on her search
for new employment but with the
morning came rain in torrents with the
usual late february admixture of sleet
and although her cold was much better
and her eyes and nose of nearly normal
appearance aunt nora sternly forbade
any out-of-doors nonsense so eu-
phemia contented herself with a care-
ful perusal of the advertisements in
the morning paper the paper ex-
hausted she tried a novel but there was
no thrill in the hook now and it hardly
carried her though the morning then
there was lunch and some little domes-
tic tasks that were better than none
shooed from the kitchen she discarded
her apron rearranged her hair and got

into a pretty little house-dress-which
was an inspired proceeding for she had
hardly made the change before the bell
rang and aunt nora at the speaking-
tube said yes shes in mr luttrell
is it well come right up

  euphemia flew to stop her but it was
too late there was nothing for it but
to open the door and admit him which
she reluctantly did mr luttrell load
been quite obviously exposed to the
weather and this circumstance removed
some of the awkwardness of the meet-
ing

  why youre wet through i ex-
claimed euphemia with real concern
havent you an umbrella

  yes but i didnt need it luttrell
answered with a smile im not wet
underneath my coat heres the um-
brella its yours i-er-thought id
bring it to you it was quite embar-
rassing to euphemia the way he looked
at her he had never stared before
but then hed never seen her in that
particular little dress and with her hair
in that particular style

  you should have worn your rain-
coat said euphemia when they were
seated couldnt you get it mended
she was still a little confused

  i suppose i could have but i didnt
think of it luttrell answered its
good to have you talking to me again
like this he continued with sudden
warmth like old times

  not very old times said euphe-
mia a little coldly

no he agreed in a regretful tone
but-were friends now arent we
why not euphemia thought yes
they could part friends-perhaps
but-

  perhaps you wouldnt want- she
began nervously and then  will you
excuse me for a minute please

  she left the room but returned al-
most immediately and handed him the
fatal note this is something of
yours she said very steadily  saw
you drop it but i picked it up and read
it do you think that you would want
to be friends with a girl that would do
such a thing as that

  luttrell who had given the note the
merest glance answered that he thought
he would
a hairbreadth scape for euphemia 

  and that-that-the day before yes-
terday-in the office- euphemia con-
tinued not quite so steadily i didnt
mean-at least i did mean to but it
was more on mr joplins account he
was so horrid and i thought it might
teach him a lesson and-and-

  and teach me a lesson too asked
luttrell looking gravely at the note in
his hand

  sadie didnt put any in your coat
did she euphemia exclaimed her
eyes widening with horror

   luttrell nodded

   truly i told her not to

  im glad she did anyway joplin
has had his lesson i took him away
from you the other night i dont think
you saw me then-took him into a
quiet alley and bumped it pretty
thoroughly into his understanding
luttrell spoke indifferently-absently
apparently he was reading the note
suddenly he looked up and his eyes
seemed to blaze with understanding as
they met euphemias

  lord he cried you thought i
was a married man 

  he laughed and crumpling the note
let it fall to the floor thats from my
sister bessie he explained she and
the kids came to me when her husband
died he got up and euphemia would
have got up too but all at once she felt
too weak for the effort-too weak to
resist when he took her hand and
turned her averted head toward him

  i believe theres a chance for me
phemie phemie is there

  he would have been very dull indeed
if he had had to ask the question
twice

rut presently euphemia pushed him
away in a panic of doubt and fear
you didnt really care until just
this minute she breathed its an im-
pulse you havent thought what it
means to you-and to me mr luttrell
-please

  listen said luttrell earnstly
ive been in love with you from the
first minute i fairly saw you and i
never gave a girl or woman a second
thought in that way in my life listen
to me phemie darling perhaps i was
therell be another story by kennett harris

 too busy with other things but its so
 and it didnt make me happy to be in
 love with you because it seemed to me
  was too rough and too homely and
 maybe too old for a girl like you to
 care for i was afraid of you-afraid
 to speak to you almost and when i
 did speak to you and you were nice to
 me-why i thought maybe if i was
 very careful went very slow perhaps-

 but it got too much for me i

 fixed up this special session because i
 couldnt wait any longer to see if i had
 a show i said ill ask her to marry
 me anyway but i held myself in pretty
 well didnt i dear and then you
 stopped me-short then i thought
 there was somebody else maybe and
 that you had guessed how i was feel-
 ing about you i thought that even
 when i came into this room just now-
 honest

   he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket
 i dont often buy jewelry but-this
 is something that belongs to you phe-
 mie but i wasnt going to return it to
 you look

   it was a massive locket gemmed
 outrageously that he showed her his
 big thumb pressed its spring and it
 opened behind the gold-edged circle
 of glass was more gold-a thick coiled
 strand every thread of which had made
 euphemia wince with pain as it was
 plucked from her head for the disrup-
 tion of possible happy homes

   its all there cried luttrell
 triumphantly i got it all and i
 meant to take it back with me any-
 way i can take all this back with me
 too cant i phemie-dear little phe-
 mie 

   he put his hand gently on her head
 and the locket fell to the floor with a
 thump entirely unregarded in fact
 it was aunt nora who picked it up-
 some little time later

   and what may this be she asked

   its a locket answered euphemia
 blushing

   luttrell showed some little em-
 barrassment too as he took the trinket
 but he leaned to euphemia and quoted
 hood

come with a ring

conversation changing to the current
pnce of coeoanuts she opened it and
came in with a cargo of fried chicken

  this description does not sound
particularly seductive yet the clients
of the fig tree tavern seemed to find
her so-very for one thing her skin
was uncommonly fine and clear for that
region and she was always immacu-

about jane a certain intense femininity
which made its appeal to the strongly
masculine natures of the men she came
in contact with she loved the atmos-

undismayed it is probable that she
could have trounced the average sailor
in a rough-and-tumble and would rather
have enjoyed the scuffle she loved a

zest of a fight and she had seen more

  the fig tree did not cater particu-

port of call for the local native sailor-
men and coasters-an old fashioned es-
tablishment which had its name from a
very large specimen of the genus ficus
which littered the untidy front garden
with decaying fruit nobody appearing
to relish fresh figs to this class of

abounding vigor and merry mischie-

their mirthful twinkle at the corners
seemed always roving in search of some

occurred only when emergency de-

vitality he drank only when ashore

  jane was secretly and passionately
in love with him he filled her eye
she loved to tease and torment him
inviting a good-natured scuffle for the
delight of feeling the strong contact of
his powerful strength you jane

had threatened and then at her tug on
his thick short chestnut curls he had

her halfway up the outdoor stairs which
led to the broad veranda encircling the

rolled her over his shoulder carried her
to terra firma kissed her thoroughly
and ducked her swing at his head as he
let her go returning with a broad grin
to encounter the vigorous protestations
of the old yellow mammy who officiated
as chaperon

  such encounters left jane breathless

  so jane cherished her secret passion
for capn billy though often her heart
sank at its hopelessness it seemed to
her that she had always been in love
with him since the days when as a
tempestuous little girl he had severed a
lock of her oakum hair with his keen-
edged sheath-knife and told her that he
wanted to calk a leak in his dinghy
sometimes he had hrought her little
presents demanding a kiss in return
which he was invariably obliged to col-
lect by force majcure usually getting
as cumshaw a cuff which made his ear
sing jane adoring him had infinite
faith in his goodness though she feared
that where light loves were concerned
he might not be a stable quantity-
which was the truth for capn billys
nfiours up and down the coast were

topics of conunon gossip in his set he
could hardly be blamed for this the
women had invariably forced the fight-
ing

you jane called capn billy
presently aint yall got amite o
pok or bacon or the like to go with this
yere shanghai 

  whats the matter with your nose
capn billy jane demanded resting
her hands on her broad hips and re-
garding him with her impudent
face cocked at an angle don yall
smell it a-cookin  she stepped around
to his elbow and before the wary mari-
ner had time to duck took a full hand-
ful of his chestnut curls in her strong
hand out that way capn said she
and gave his head a twist toward the
kitchen smell good and hard lis-
ten too and you can hear it a-sizzlin
a man with lugs like yours hadnt
ought to be deef in her other
hand she seized one of capn billys
auricular appendages and tugged it for-
ward hear it hissin she asked
jane found it difficult to keep her hands
off capn billy when he was about his
crisp curling hair particularly appealed
to her

  ouch tun loose my har gal
leggo mv ear what you-all take me
fo-a mule

  i sholy dont capn billy most
mules got some sense they know
when their grubs a-comiu she loosed
her hold and skipped arouud the comer
of the table with the agility of a rus-
sian dancer evading capn billys grab
at that part of her which was most ad-
jacent beave vorsef said she and
shook her finger at him for capn
billy with two juleps permeating his
central heating system was showing
signs of restiveness

  yall better bave yorsef he
growled with a smothered chuckle
you keep on pesterin me thataway
and something will shore happen to you
one o these days i shall certainly mal-
treat you gal prophetic words for
which jane affected huge contempt

  you aint man enough she
answered and cast her eye at the swing-
ing door

jane

can like me ill shore stow you in my
pouch and swaller you when i get

  yall would certainly choke jane
answered dont give me no sass or
i might see reason to take yore measure
on the flo go way from me man
heres yo pok and she fled through
the swinging door colliding violently
with aunt mandy which elderly
negress was growing bored at the per-
siflage and disgustedly fetching a mess
of acorn-fatted razor-back swimming
in a pepper sauce jane rescued the
dish before it fell scalding her arm
the pain of the burn gave her a pecul-
iar sensation of pleasure

  yeres you pok mister capn
billy bills said she shoving the dish
against his left elbow and trying to
stifle the cry which the boiling fat on
her bare arm was nearly driving out of
her

  capn billy disregarded his favorite
dish and his blue eyes fastened on
janes arm

  thar he said you done scalded
yoreself child run out quick and till
aunt mandy to put some cottonseed oil
on it go long honey we aint
pressed none that all is what comes
o triflin id ought tove known bet-
ter

   taint your fault said jane i
always was a flibberty-jibbet and
she fled to the kitchen

apn billy and his mate the
latter a serious-minded yankee of
yarmouth maine consumed their food
in the silent and serious manner be-
fitting sailor-men with shore appetites
and with aunt mandys excellent cook-
ing before them

  she needs marryin repeated the
mate pushing away his well-polished
plate

  well why dont she go and get
spliced then asked capn billy
earnestly

  i dont know answered the mate
but all the same she needs it why
dont you marry her captain he
absorbed a little more pork and gravy
from the large dish shes ornery-no

question about that look how she
rubbed them eggs into my har but
i got sort of an idea that shes a good
girl and might make a man a good wife
-him bein a good provider o course
she fancies you a lot and you fancy
her she aint no beauty-

  shet your ol fool mouth said
capn bill you better be gettin out

denser pipe is all adrift and needs some
tinkerin afore we start for george-
town im aimin to leave at sun-up
with the tide we got to get there this
day week if we want to load them
shingles for philadelphia

  when you cornin off aboard
asked the mate

  oh to-night some time don yall
go botherin about me ill come when
i get ready you might go round up
the hands they were headin out for
nicks place and theys always the
chance of onpleasantness on the eve of
mardi gras herd em out afore mid-
night if so you can she begins to boil
after eight bells

  so the mate departed and capn
billy lighted a twisted cheroot rich and
mild and contraband then leaning back
in his chair he gave himself up to the
pleasant exercise of a perfect digestion
he was agreeably intoxicated well fed
with a good smoke between his strong
white teeth later he had a tryst with
a certain pretty creole lady as the
short semitropic twilight faded capn
billy reflected its waning glow in face
and heart after all it was a pretty
good old world and a pleasant one to
live in

  then jane entered with a taper to
fire up the big brass lamp aunt
mandy had thrown a bandage around
her scalded arm and as she reached up-
ward capn billy observed her with
great approval through his enveloping
cloud of tobacco-smoke and thought
what a fine big girl she had grown to
be seeing her in some difficulty be-
cause of the burnt arm he gallantly
arose and performed the function him-
self slightly unsteady on his strong
legs but successful withal

  yore arm still hutin honey he
asked kindly

  oh nev mind about my arm capn

  capn billy drew her on his knee
jane resisted but not very much i

domineerin ways said she

pny waitin too anything for yo

  oh give me a stoup o that cane

answered the matanzas i fetched

jne rested her hands on her hips
and looked at him very hard her
face was white and her full lips pushed
out in front

  you don need no mo drink capn
billy said she what if i brew yall
some good hot tea

  thank you kindly capn billy
answered but i aint sufferin from
cold get me that rum gal like ah tol
you the blood surged into his face
capn billy was good-natured as a rule
but cross when his cups began to wear
themselves out of his system

  jane stared at him for a moment
then she turned her back and walked
toward the door on the threshold she
paused and looked back over her
shoulder

  don ask me to serve you capn
billy cause i wont said she y all
can go address yoself to aunt mandy
all this yere rovin and drinkin will
shorely be yore ruin some day capn
billy anri you such a strong man

shake

  tun me loose gal muttered capn
billy you keep on like that an i

  yes jane answered and i might
do you a heap o good capn billy
seized by an irresistible impulse she
flung her antis around his neck tilted
back his bead and kissed him passion-
ately on the lips i jes adore you
capn billy she said i reckon i al-
ways have loved you of cose  know
you don care nothin about me and
wouldnt marry me even if you did
but it just huts me through and
through to see you ruinin yoresef with
drink honey if only yall will leave
the nasty stuff alone ill do anything
yo ask me capn billy

  she stood for a moment looking
down at him with glowing eyes and
heaving bosom vitally feminine as
she was the ardor pulsating from her
smote on capn billys strong masculin-
ity with an overpowering appeal but
to his everlasting credit let it be said
that his kindliness and decency and all
of those other qualities of a strong man
the sum of which is his personal honor
still held like the straining spars of a
tempest-tossed gale-driven but stanch
and honest ship

  he sprang to his feet capsizing the
chair and his powerful grip fell on
janes uninjured wrist

  yo mean that gal he demanded
almost roughly and the tone of his
voice and the gleam of his blue eyes
terrified jane-yet fascinated her her
breathing was so violent as to interfere
with speech but her eyes meeting his
for an instant fell in acquiescence
capn billy drew her to him until her
bosom was crushed against his broad
chest put on yore bunnit and come
jane



with me jane lie muttered and kissed
her

  wh-wh-where capn billy qua-
vered jane

  uptown a mite-to ol mr jack-
son the baptist minister  figger to
marry you a heap lile gal and right

leave yo before it makes day

  but-but capn billy jane pro-
tested are yall sho-

  cose im sho come long sweet-
heart mine ill fix it up with aunt
mandy to look after things while youre
gone come quick honey

  he caught her to him again and so
strongly that for all of her resilient
strength she was left half suffocated
she swayed unsteadily as he loosed her
then looked up at him with stricken
unseeing eyes

   jes a minute capn billy darlin
she murmured ecstatically le me
get my breath dear ill come

it is a question if capn billy wos
altogether to blame for what
immediately followed in his sober
senses he would no more have thought
of marrying jane than he would have
thought of deliberately wrecking the
ivaccomaw nor could any passion
otherwise have so much as tempted him
to such a course as he had followed

  and jane when her bridegroom
left her a little after midnight her mind
rocked at the knowledge that she was
capn billys wedded wife it was too
supreme for her powers of imagina-
tion

  poor jane if she could have seen
her husband during these transports of
hers

  i shore gone and made a plum fool
o myself reflected capn billy as he
trudged down to the fish-house to go
aboard i aint built fer no marryin
man

  almost to the jetty he scented rum
and hung in the wind he might have
stood on again avoiding temptation
but for a tiny half-caste brat which flee-
ing from an irate mother fell almost

under his feet like most strong men
capn billy was possessed of great
tenderness for children and so he
picked up the baby and carried it into
the low restaurant-har whence it had
escaped

  yall don deserve to have no kids
said he severely to the mother a flam-
boyant mulattress whom he knew
-lettin em run loose and hut them-
selves the like o that

  i dont want em answered the
mother insolently

  capn billy set down the child and
then reached in his pocket for a dime

  yere-stop a-cryin and buy yore-
sef some candy lile sweetheart said
he then turning to the mother ill
ave a drop of cane rum mis millicent
if youll be so kind

  she served him and her hot eyes
glowed

  youre a nice man capn billy
said she too bad yall aint married
and you so fond of chillun

  oh i figger to one o these days
capn billy answered with a sinking
of the diaphragm and a little cough as
the raw matanzas went home to make
trouble thats a good sample miss
millicent lets ave another please
you

  she served him another long and
strong capn billy eyed it and then
took it at a gulp

  good night mis millicent said he
i reckon i better be genin out abod
and he lurched out into the street

  so capn billy stood across the fair-
way under a full pressure of steam all
day long he had been loading alcohol in
bulk and the violence of recent emo-
tions having now subsided the poison-
ous fumes began to assail all parts of
his fabric with overpowering force he
realized that his powers of resistance
were waning and with the usual fatuity
of a drunken man decided to take an-
other bracer to put him back where
he belonged then he decided that as
he was to sail with the tide it might be
just as well to look into nicks place
and see that none of the ivaccainazes
crew were still lingering there so he
put his helm over and bore away for
this treacherous haven of which
presently he sighted the lights of the
 

the blue book magazine

bar and breakwater and after that he
remembered nothing

apn billy awoke and was ill

   he went to sleep after this-then
reawakened feeling badly but in full
possession of his faculties though stdl
nauseated	

  but it was not his sickness which
bothered capn billy he was wonder-
ing where he was and why while
turning these problems in his mind he
spied a water-monkey swinging over an
empty bunk next his and reaching for
it he drained it in about three gulps
slightly refreshed he sat up a
poisoned sailor in a bunk under his
groaned and gazed up at him with the
eyes of a dying fish but capn billy was
not interested he had a low opinion
of drunkards

  his head presently clearing he
managed to get on deck steadily
enough to discover fort pickens dis-
solving in the haze astern and a tug
casting off from the sailing vessel which
he happened to be aboard some un-
steady persons up aloft were gyrating
about on the foot-ropes

  well ere you are at larst said a
querulous voice in capn billys ear
turn to and lend a and

  capn billy surveyed him with hos-
tile contempt he guessed him to be
the mate standing aft beside the
wheel was one whom he correctly sur-
mised to be the skipper both were
meager scrawny individuals and capn
billy could have taken one in either
hand and dashed their heads together

  ill lend nothin he growled how
dasted you-all to shanghai me-and me
a ships captain yall set me asho
and plum quick or by the tamal ill
tun mysef loose and tar things up
with his powerful body square jaw
and the fighting light beginning to kin-
dle in his fierce blue eyes capn billy
looked quite capable of taking charge
the two officers exchanged glances

  we never did shanghai you
snapped the mate we dont old with
no such practice this is a christian
ship my man with a god-fearin skip-
per and a righteous crew barrin only
the bosun maybe who at times takes
the lords name in vain you and your

mate came aboard of your own accords

-leastwise e did fetchin you along
e arsked if you might work your pas-
sages to plymouth and us bein under-
manned agreed so there you are if
you want to know any more op up
aloft and arsk im and the mate
jerked his head at the royal yard of
the little bark

  capn billy stared and then glanced
aloft something familiar in the squat
figure at work up there caught and held
his eye it turned and capn billy dis-
covered to his astonishment that it was
none other than one jake saunders a
smart young hand of his aboard the
waccama w

  yo jake he called come down
yere this minute

  the mate turned on him angrily git
aloft yourself if you got anythink to
sy said he camt ye see were
mykin sail

  yo shet yo fool mouth retorted
capn billy whose respect for the bark
and those aboard her had not been en-
hanced by the information imparted by
the mate as to her virtuous character
im capn william williams master
and half owner o the steamship wac-
camaw and im aimin to learn the
reason why befo  let mysef git toted
off thisaway

the mate shrugged his bony
shoulders and turned to the silent
skipper who stood frowning and biting
at his straggling mustache beside the
ancient mariner who was at the wheel

   eres a nice go matthews said
he bitterly a drunken and violent
he pronounced it wurlent party
comes aboard a caam and decent wes-
sel and starts in to tyke charge wot sy
you we eave to and lower and set im
back on the beach

   ave patience luke replied the
skipper let im see wot is pal as
got to sy

  capn billy regarded the pair whom
he rightly took to he brothers in wrath
and wonder then as jake swung
lightly down to the deck capn billy
stepped forward

  what all is the meanin of this
he demanded fiercely am i still
drunk or dreamin or what
jane



  the young man stared at him in
astonishment don yall remember
nothin about it capn billy

  i shore dont i don remember
nothin from the time i left millicents
place

   sakes alive capn billy yall was
steerin a straight cose enough when
yo come into nicks place yo eyes
was sure some bloodshot but yo acted
intelligent which was very far
from the truth

   seems to me i do reclcct goin into
nicks place capn billy answered
but i disremember if twas afternoon
or night

  it was nigh midnight and the mate
ad rounded up the boys and druv em
off abod i see im come in and hid
out feelin sort o frolicksome and
frisky and not wantin to tun in
straight off jes as well fo yo i did
capn billy and jakes face assumed
a drawn and tragic look

  why demanded capn billy
struggling against a sense of impend-
ing ill

  jake lowered his voice yall done
killed a man capn billv

  wha-whas that capn billy felt
his knees buckling under him me
killed a man what yall talkin abat
boy me killed a man-in nicks
place he struggled against a sudden
sense of faintness and nausea

  thats what yall done but not in
nicks place take affirmed mebbe i
done killed another i caint be sho
didnt wait fo to make certain when
yall went out o nicks i seed yo was
shore some blurred and tangled and i
was feelin het up a mite myself we
went down to sailor kittys-

  that low-flung stew cried capn
billy in horror

  thats wheah but we didnt stop
none jes looked in an you set down
and fished out a dough-ball and peeled
off a v and they-all yallow gals start
the music thish yeres my weddin
night and yere come the villagers says
you y all can heah the hawns on the
mountains and sich-like talk yo
was shore intoxicated a heap capn
billy well they was a gang o them
geeses and cubians offen their snapper
boals and they got lookin rusty a

whole lot when you done histed that
dough-ball and i didnt much fahncy
the cut o their jibs so i got yo out
and we laid a cose for the fish-house
we was amost to the landin and i
was a-figgerin to borrow a skiff and
tote us off abod when they come a
flash and blim yere was a knife
thrummin in the plankin it jist
slummed under yore arm twas at
the comer of the fish-house and they
was a couple of fish-foks lyin handy
so i whipped em up and handed you
one i give my man the butt but you
socked yores in like yo was pitchin
out groupers them tines sho went
their lenth he squalled like a bunt
cat and the others run so i drug you
down to the landin and woke up a
half-drunk negro and made him fetch
us out abod this one i knew she
was fixin to sail

capn billy lurched against the
 rail and drew his shirt-sleeve across
his dripping face

  killed em he groaned

  reckon so jake answered now
beginning rather to relish his narration
the pair of em seemed laid out pretty
stiff so fur as i cn reclect i got an
idee this ol fool of a skipper sus-
picioned us o some wrong doin but he
was shot-handed and wishful to sail
so he didnt interrogate me to no great
amount i tol him we was outward
boun and he let her go at that

  capn billy pulled himself together
with great effort the breeze was light
still off-shore but there had been a
strong souwester blowing for three or
four days previous and the chunky
little bark was pitching and rolling and
clashing her gear and slatting her sails
and shifting loose dunnage here and
there but all of this was the picture
of stability as compared with the rock-
ing of capn billys mind

  i reckon yall done the right thing
jake said he heavily after a few mo-
ments of bitter reflection its
true we was set on and defendin of
ourseves but all that crew would swar
we was the aggressors and us hevin
been on the loose so to speak makes
the business black we better lie low
a leetle whars she bound this un 
-



the blue book magazine

  to plymouth jake answered

  oh that aint so far mebbe it 
blow over a mite afore we git back

  its some trot capn billy jake
answered nigh onto four thousand
miles they tell me and this aint no
cracker-jack fer speed espeshul loaded
scuppers-under with turkentine and
pine

  lordy gasped capn billy hour
thousand miles vail aint talkin
about plymouth england boy

  thats whar she due to fetch up if
she keeps on driftin long enough
take answered stop an think capn
billy thish yeres a british ship

  capn billy stopped and thought
bitter oh bitter was the cud of his
reflections but they were brief he
turned and strode aft the mate had
been wearily occupying himself about
the decks his querulous voice exhort-
ing the lagging steps of the old men and
young boys who maimed her occa-
sionally his rheumy eyes had turned
with a sort of dreary curiosity on
capn billy and jake-the only two
strong men aboard

  capn billy tightened his belt went
to the scuttlebutt and took a swig of
water then he walked aft

  still insistin to be sot ashore
asked luke

  no capn billy answered tighten-
ing his lips tun me to mister mate
im strong and willin

it was a tedious wyage but eventually

	they arrived in its course the mate
was taken ill with some insidious
trouble which deprived him of his
scant forces the skipper proved to
be a cupboard drinker and was vague
and inefficient capn billy and jake
bore the brunt of such hard and difficult
work as became necessary now and
then

  during this long voyage across the
storm-set atlantic capn billy had
plenty of time to reflect upon his bad
conduct of one night which had
brought all of this misery to pass but
he did not to any great extent having
no recollection whatever of his picking
up a portuguese fisherman on the end
of a fish-fork and tossing him to one
side that carelcss act worried him not

in his moral sense but in his civic
responsibility at that time the civil
law of pensacola had been swejt by a
tidal wave of reform there had been
too many of these casual killings for
the city to support with due dignity
and examples had to be made the fete
of mardi gias had become so obnox-
ious in this respect that there was talk
of suppressing it entirely masque and
domino offered too many possibilities
for working off private grudges

  and jane capn billy tried his best
to put jane out of his thoughts and
failed absolutely janes image haunted
him continually but not with the
pleasant retrospective picture of so
many light loves the adoration in her
gray-green eyes cast unpleasant lights
against the carnal illumination of his
soul and he tried to banish them but
without success he well knew that
she was the only one who had ever
loved him with absolute unselfishness-
and his soul squirmed when he was
compelled to remember what he had
given her in return for that greatest
gift of all love without alloy the ele-
mental force

  soon after landing in england capn
billv wrote to a friend a young lawyer
of pensacola stating his case and ask-
ing for advice in due time he received
an answer and what was his amazement
and that of jake to learn that the
lawyer could discover nothing what-
ever in connection with the case-that
in his opinion the damage could not
have been very serious that capn
billy had been a fool to bolt off as he
did and that he ran no risk whatever
in returning whenever he felt like it

  capn billys intense relief at this
information was all that saved jake
from a mighty bad quarter-hour the
two men had stuck together and had
found work in a ship-yard though this
was not immediately necessary as the
night of his debauch capn billy had
in his pocket about three hundred dol-
lars with which he had intended to pay
a store bill the letter also told him
that his friends and jakes had been
sorely grieved and puzzled at their
disappearance and had finally come to
believe that while drunk they must have
met with foul play along the water
jane	

front and their bodies flung into the
harbor to be carried out by the tide
and then at the very end of the epistle
came a bit of news that aroused con-
tradictory emotion in capn billys
breast it read as follows

    i dropped in at the fig tree a few
  davs before receiving your letter and
  the old man told me that jane took on
  something terrible when about six
  weeks had passed with no news from
  you she wouldnt believe that you
  had been murdered said you were too
  well able to take care of yourself and
  that besides you had promised her not
  to drink any more that night she
  moped and pined and then one day
  somebody told her theyd seen you com-
  ing out of sailor kittys house along
  about one oclock in the morning she
  wouldnt believe it at first but there
  were three or four boys off the favorite
  that swore thed seen you and jake go
  in there earlier in the evening

    jane went sort of wild after that
  and began to behave so reckless that the
  old man told her he wouldnt permit
  such goings on by a female member of
  his household a little later there came
  along a flashy sort of patent-medicine
  faker and jane took up with him the
  old man had already put up with a lot
  so he lost his temper and just up and
  bundled her out and thats the last hes
  heard of her some of the boys saw
  her at the station getting on the train
  with this patent medicine fellow

papn billys first emotion on
 reading this was one of bitter re-
morse and self-reproach but it was
soon followed by a certain sense of in-
voluntary relief after all he reflected
jane had brought the trouble on her-
self he had not desired to marry her
and the mischief done he had firmly in-
tended to keep his promise to her
he had been drunk all the late after-
noon and she had known it and ought
to have shown some sense of caution
besides jane ought to have waited
longer in the hope of hearing from him
he might have been shanghaied he
was honestly grieved about tane and
blamed himself severely but the thing
was done and there you are

y few weeks later capn billy and
jake arrived in pensacola where
they received a warm welcome in their
own particular circles acting on the
advice of the lawyer friend nothing
was said about die incident which had

occurred in the lee of the fish-house
their story was simply that they had
been shanghaied aboard a british bark
while blind drunk and had made the
best of a bad business which they could
not help but admit had been due to their
own silly fault

  we had a nice sail said capn
billy when questioned as to the adven-
ture it didnt do us no harm and
maybe its done taught us some sense
cose we might a took charge and sot
ourselves aho but that might a
meant a killin and we was too sick
and so and hadnt the heart fo no sich
triflin we was jes two natral born
plum fools and we knowed it and
made the best of it but yall can have
my share o the drink yereafter
theres shore to be a devil in every
bottle

  about the first thing he did was to
go to the fig tree and make inquiry
for jane the old patron had no news
of her and showed not the slightest
desire for such tidings neither did he
appear particularly gratified at the
sight of capn billy though entirely
polite capn billy wondered how
much old desportes knew or suspected
and left the fig tree with his favorite
dish of pepper-pot half eaten and the
resolution to strike this venerable tav-
ern off his calendar as a port of call

cor nearly four years capn billy

	pursued an industrious and legiti-
mate trade and flourished thereat he
drank nothing stronger than beer or on
certain occasions w hen extremely
thirsty a brimming goblet of lime- or
lemon- or bitter-orange-juice with the
slight dash of gin required to relax the
tension of mind and muscle to be found
in a person of his force his acquaint-
ances found him less amusing-a little
dull at times-and they wondered why

the marryin kind said capn billy in
answer to certain anxious queries on
this vital subject

  a tidy little iron ship replaced the
wooden waccatuazv which was gutted
from stem to stern and her vital organs
scrapped-her empty shell being cor-
verted into a coal-barge the new
boat was rather smart as to speed and

earned a good living in the transport

northern markets - pines bananas
cocoamns oranges avocadoes and the
like capn billy was her master of
course and the faithful jake now mar-
ried and the paterfamilias of two small
squeakers his mate

  capn billy sometimes carried a pas-
senger or two at times even four or
five more for the pleasure of their
society than the profit of their pas-
sage-or to put it more accurately the
interest of their society this measure
was strictly illegal the ship having no
passenger ficense but the letter of the
tow was adjust-
able as childrens
block s-and no
harm was done un-
less some hypercon-
scientious fool in a
bureau felt disposed
to kick and slam
through patriotism
and the off chance
of getting a promo-
tion the passen-
gers were listed as
members of the ships crew henrico
valdez asst steward the chief
steward being an aged black who
understood terrapin as made from alli-
gator-tail and hard-boiled eggs del-
phine valdez stewardess said del-
phine being the friend of henrico and
going with him to help demonstrate the
real venezuela tango to club-footed
new yorkers-and the like all going
from pensacola to south street n y
or boston as the fruit market decrecd
for fifteen dollars per capita they
amused capn billy and often he got
very fond of some of them he liked
to talk to the more serious ones after
the less serious ones had been talking
to him

apn billy enjoyed such passen-
gers and iried his best to make
them comfortable-which they seldom
were after cutting the edge of the gulf
stream and plugging along on the me-
ridian until the water shoaled and the
sea flattened out all the same he liked
to have them aboard even as his unpay-
tng guests which often they were and

so when a short squat quartermaster
whose face had always puzzled capn
billy came and told him that a lady with
a little boy desired a passage from new
york to pensacola or some othor port
adjacent capn billy told the man to
tell mr ponsonby the black steward
and blacker than most to arrange her
a berth the little steamship was due
to sail in an hour aud it was three days
after christmas the winter had been
very mild but capn billy was not en-
tirely pleased with the softness of the
air for tliat season shes a-goin to
bust some time twixt ere and the dela-
ware he said to himself but it dont
matter much i
could wade in beind
the breakwater in
my boots

  off sandy hook
they ran into a bank
of fog and about
midnight as capn
billy had predicted
it began to blow
the new ivacca-
mmv was a steady
little ship of about
eighteen hundred tons and being fairly
deep with her cargo of miscellaneous
freight she pushed stubbornly along
through the smother without mak-
ing any fuss about it the weather
went rapidly from bad to worse
with the wind backing into the
southeast and the air filled with the
moist warm welter of the gulf stream
and as thick and heavy as porridge
capn billy was on the bridge most of
the night uneasy in his mind big iron
sailing ships flying northward under a
heavy press of canvas were what he
most feared and it was precisely one
of these which he encountered

  this happened in the gray dawn of
the third day out the weather having
remained practically unchanged it
was still blowing what sailormen would
call a fresh gale from the southeast
a fresh gale rates in between a stiff
breeze and a gale after which come a
hard gale and a hurricane in this
case it was merely a fresh gale and
judging from experience and the be-
havior of the barometer capn billy
opined that it would soon blow out

probably to be followed by an abrupt
hauling of the wind into the northwest
with clear and colder weather and great
relief from anxiety he had been liv-
ing on the bridge and in the little chart-
room wedged under it whither his
meals were brought him by mr pon-
sonby the very black steward

r ponsonby informed him that
the lady passenger was recovering
from acute seasickness her little boy
a baby of three had not been sick at all
and had spent most of his time with
mr ponsonby for whom he had con-
ceived a great affection fully recip-
rocated

  ah do declar capn billy dis lile
marsler am de mos ingratiatin chile
an eat his paw mus shorely hev
been a seafarin gentleman i done fix
him little messes o pok an beans an
brade an lasses an seems lak he caint
git full up

  dont yall go fo to kill that kid
with kindness mr ponsonby warned
capn billy it had always tickled his
fancy to call the old black by this high-
sounding name

  no fear capn billy yo got a
moment ob leisure sar id sho like
to make you quaint ob lile marster

  all right go fetch im said
capn billy who was feeling very
jaded from intense vigilance and lack
of sleep he trusted no mans sea eyes
as he did his own

  so mr ponsonby ci-devant second
mate of a new suffolk whaler dodged
heavy sprays to the ladder and going
below sought out his young friend and
parceling him snugly in an oiler tucked
him under his massive bony arm and
bore him to the chart-room where he
set him down for the inspection of
capn billy

  wish capn billy good day lile
marster said mr ponsonby solici-
tous for the etiquette of the occasion

  the baby a sturdy little chap though
ot thick-set regarded capn billy from
a pair of widely set and very luminous
blue eves there was a peculiar inten-
atiy about this contemplation strangely
disturbing to capn billy in one of
those swift flashes of recollection he
saw himself as a very little boy study-

ing himself in a cracked mirror and
wondering who he was and why his
heart smote his strong ribs as he exam-
ined that small earnest face then a
small hand like a star and with stubby
fingers freely spaced fell on his knee

  papa said lile marster and
squirmed against him

  mr ponsonby smote his thigh

  ya-ha-ha he chuckled he sho
has done took to you capn billy sar
jes lak i done know e boun to he
steadied lile marster against the sling
of the ship as she breasted a sea dar
honey-dat genman am capn billy
bills-dat who all he is

  papa repeated the baby staring
earnestly up into capn billys face

  mr ponsonby presuming on his
favor with the captain found it impos-
sible to restrain his senile mirth

  dar capn billy said he hit done
say in holy writ dat wise chillum know
dere papas-and dis yere lile marster
sweetie am sho a wise chile who
gwine know capn billy yo done
rove a heap in yo time

  shet you dam fool mouth
snapped capn billy and readied to
remove the babys hand it closed
around his finger-and at that moment
there came terrific tremendous up-
roars impossible to describe rending
crashes and cries hoarse and shrill-and
then the stanch little waccantaw reeled
and staggered and shrieked in pain
over she went  her beam ends the
lights went out and there was the rip
and tear and clash and clatter of utter
dissolution capn billy sitting on the
edge of the narrow bunk pitched for-
ward  but as he felt himself going he
snatched for the baby and rolled the
child in his arms

through all this horrid clamor
a capn billy did not for an instant
lose his head he irnew precisely what
had happened pie had not pictured
some such event in vain during those
long hours of anxious watchfulness
he could almost see the great spread-
ing spars raking him fore and aft
sweeping away masts and funnel and
boats and everything that was pos-
sibly detachable and he could feel the
massive iron forefoot of this great clip-

      struggled up still holding the
baby in his arms but the elderly afri-
can was even quicker and had fished a
match from his pocket and lighted the
lamp which was set in gimbals of
course and suffered only the loss of its
chimney capn billy was always a
firm believer in oil standing-lights at
s

  someting done hit us capn billy 
mumbled mr ponsonbjr an hit us
right hard

  take the kid said cap n billy
wait here and he dived out into
the murk	

  at first lie naturally could distinguish
nothing glancing aloft he saw that
masts and funnel were gone the ship
was heeled at about thirty degrees and
the sea beginning to fling over her as
she broached to capn billy jumped
up to the bridge there was nobody
the rail was gone the wheel was gone
the men were gone jake and the quar-
termaster then he looked aft and dis-
covered that the boats were gone the
superstructure of the little ivaccainaw
looked like the top of a raft then as
he stared wildly about there came ter-
rific noises from below and great
masses of steam seething up through
the aperture where the funnel had been
to be swirled away in the rush of
wind

  he searched the pale gloom to lee-
ward but there was nothing to be seen
undertoning the crash of the seas he
could hear gurgling sucking noises and
he realized that the ship was sinking
rapidly all of this in brief seconds of
time during which he realized that it
would take the tall ship which had rid-
den them down a good hour to shorten
sail and heave to and lower boats if
that were possible in the general havoc

which must have happened to herself in

the collision

  the game was up though capn
billy feeling the lurch and stagger un-
der his feet there was the kid and its
mother they must be floated off
somehow and such of the crew as re-
mained aboard would have to shift for
themselves and they were doing so
cries and shouts came from the stem
which was thrusting upward as the ship
settled forward there were no boats
so far as he could see but a couple of
life-rafts used sometimes for hogging
the ships sides were still secure

  clambering aft through the wreck
and litter he made his way to the
lamp-room where he lighted a lantern
and then made for the companionway
his passengers room was on the side
of the ship hove down and as capn
billy plunged into the cabin he heard
the womans muffled shrieks and a bat-
tering upon the door of her stateroom
which was jammed

  all right bawled capn billy
stand one side maam im a-going
to bust er in

  two blows with the heel of his heax-y
sea-boot splintered the door and drove
it clear capn billy raised his lantern
and looked within the woman clad
only in night-robe and wrapper was
leaning against the side of the bunk
and as the glare was reflected from her
pale face capn billys heart gave a tre-
mendous bound

  jane he cried yo jane

  yes jane she answered fiercely
what yall gone and done with yore
ol ship wheres my lile boy

  up in the chart-room with the stew-
ard he answered and held out his
hand come quick jane shes sulk-

new york boarding-houses
shelter from time to time
some extremely differing
types and it would be hard to
imagine two couples more different
than grandma and grandpa bunker
and colonel and mrs

jebberson who had
rooms on the same floor
at mrs wimmers jabez
bunker was as sweetly
innocent as a baby and
with his bald pink head
kindly eyes and little
nubbin of a nose he
looked like a baby fie
was round and cheerful
and guileless and his gold-rimmed
spectacles and little bunch of white
chin-whiskers only emphasized all this
he looked as he was an innocent mid-
west retired farmer and nothing but
his desire to do new yorkers as they
like to be done had induced him to
give up the comforts of his home at
oroduna iowa and come to the great
metropolis to enter the profession of
bunco-steerer and confidence man

  dear old grandma bunker-than
whom no gentler and sweeter old lady
ever lived-was right proud of the way
in which grandpa bunker has thus far
succeeded in buncoing new yorkers

  jabez she often said to him it
aint right becomin for your own wife
to praise ye but i must say that
im downright glad you aint loafin
around the grocery at oroduna
listenin to land knows what shameful
gossip a hundred times
a day i thank ray stars
youve got a nice clean
honest bunco-business to
keep you busy

 mr bunker agreed
with her not for all the
money in the world
would he have turned
his hand to anything dis-
honest but bunco-steer-
ing was an easy respectable calling it
kept mr bunker from gfttmg rusty
and as the cashier of the oroduna bank
had once told mr bunker its a favor
to take money from them new york-
ers when they aint being stung they
dont know theyre alive

  the jebbersons were a different
couple entirely colonel jebberson
was an elderly and distinguished-look-
ing gentleman but at the time mr and
mrs bunker first entered mrs wim-
mers boarding-house he seemed in evi-
dent hard luck it was understood
vaguely by mrs wimmer and her
hoarders that colonel jebberson had

the blue book magazine

some connection with wall street but
just what he had do with tliat money
lane no one seemed to know in any
event colonel jebberson was quite
evidently waiting for the hard times to
take a turn for the better lie was a
large and ruddy-faced man somewhat
southern in appearance and this he
emphasized by wearing a long black
frock coat a wide-brimmed soft hat
and a goatee

  airs jebberson was in a way a hold-
over she might have been called if
you chose a remnant of one of colonel
jebbersons jags of prosperity for she
still retained seemingly unending sup-
plies of once fashionable and expensive
gowns she had jewels too but these
faded from sight week after week as
the jcbbersons remained at mrs wira-
mer s

  in spite of his aristocratic southern
bearing there was something sporty
about colonel jebberson he did not
at all give the impression of a vir-
ginia gentleman who had come to new
york to wither peacefully among the
high-balls his wifes appearance in-
creased this effect her hair was a
mass of that yellow that comes
naturally from no place but the
peroxide-of-hydrogen bottle her com-
plexion quite evidently came in tubes
and boxes for all this mrs jebber-
son was as grandma bunker said a
real nice lady

  and so she was the colonels lady
could not help her looks during
one of his periods of prosperity the
colonel had snatched her from the
front row of the chorus of the giddy
widow burlesque troupe but mrs
jebberson was a kindly simple creature
at heart the weeks spent at mrs wim-
mers were intoxicating to her she
looked back on her many years of
champagne suppers quite as ordinary
mortals look back on mothers cooking
and the gay life of broadway was to
her what to me or you would be the old
life back on the farm she enjoyed
mrs wimmers boarding-house and
she loved mrs bunker they were
ereat friends one thing however
mrs jebberson never did she never
touched on the subject of colonel teb-
bersons past

vou may remember if you have a
 good memory that in  things
began to look better down wall street
way if you cant remember that far
back you can look it up in the news-
papers of that year and you will see
that bethlehem steel went to shocking
heights and an entire long list of stocks
tagged along brokers who had been
eating dry crackers and wishing they
had not used the cheese-rinds to bait
mousetraps seven years before began
once more to scold the waiters because
the pheasant was browned a bit too
much little bo peep the patron god-
dess of wall street was leading whole
droves of lambs back to be sheared
everybody was gathering wool

  by the beginning of  everyone
was feeling fine

  my dear said mrs jebberson to
grandma bunker early in january
im just as happy the colonel is in
business again and when the colonel
gets into business you can believe me
-things hum when it comes to this
stock-and-bond thing the colonel is 
slouch dont ask me anything about
it im a dead one when it comes to
business but the colonel says well be
rolling in wealth gee do you know
i kind of hate to have to leave here
ive been happy

  do you have to leave asked
grandma

  say honest you dont think the
colonel will stand for this hashery
when he has a million in his pocket do
you no she sighed it will be
riverside drive and a limousine and
champagne for me again gee but i
hate it it will be start the swedish
and begin the turkish baths and com-
mence the bant and do that eat and
be thin stuff all over again honest
you dont know how ive enjoyed
prunes and old clothes

  poor thing said grandma bun-
ker sympathetically

  whats your husband makin money
at asked jabez looking up from his
favorite book the complete conces-
sion of the king of grafters

   oh  stocks i guess said mrs jeb-
beron

  that evening when they were alone
together grandma spoke to jabez
t jebberson



   pa she said dont yoa think may-
be youd ought to speak to mis jebber-
sons husband seems like hes such a
nice well-meanin man and sellin
stocks dont seem it was honest aint it
kind of gamblin

  all depends said mr bunker as
he removed his shoes some stock-
sellin aint gamblin - its straight
bunco-business ma

  oh said mrs banker much re-
lieved then its all right maybe
the kind of stock-sellin mis jebber-
sons husband is doin is bunco-business
if it is i dont feel so bad jabez do
you reckon it is bunco stock-sellin he
is into

  shouldnt wonder ma said mr
bunker he sort of strikes me as the
kind of feller that would sell bunco
stocks

  yes said mrs bunker placidly
he is a nice man aint he

yjithin a day or two after this
 conversation newspapers in new
york and several other large ameri-
can cities blazed if black and white
can blaze with advertisements of the
timpantee oil wells company the
stock in this company was offered at
the shockingly generous price of ten
cents per share but as the company
was incorporated for  with
a par value of one dollar a share it
was easy to see that if all the stock was
sold the amount received would be ten
million dollars

  what particularly interested mr
bunker was the fact that the firm of
jebberson  hick was given as the
fiscal agents of the timpantee oil
wells company hardly a week later
another striking advertisement ap-
peared in the newspapers and this
time it was the podwolloger munitions
company and again jebberson 
hick were the fiscal agente the capi-
tal stock of the podwolloger munitions
company was  par value
one dollar per share and jebberson 
hick offered the stock at twenty cents
per share

   hie advertising of these two com-
panies was enticing but it was safe
the fiscal agents of the timpantee oil
wells company stated in bold head-

lines that hundreds of billions of dol-
lars had been made in oil wells and
that millions had been made out of
properties on either side of the tim-
pantee holdings but they did not prom-
ise anything for the timpantee they
avoided making any definite promise of
returns all they promised was to sell
stock to whomever wanted it

  the same was in a general way true
of the podwolloger munitions adver-
tising -bethlehem steel and dupont
powder were mentioned but pod-
wolloger munitions did not promise iri
cold type any such profits as those
companies had reaped it left that to
the imagination of the possible inves-
tor this was wise because time and
again fake companies that had seemed
veritable gold mines for their promoters
had jolted against the law by promis-
ing what they could not perform many
an eager fiscal agent and promoter has
had to drop a bonanza and fly into hid-
ing because he was so careless as to
promise some definite return on a
suckers investment such promises
were often made before it was learned
that no such bait was needed to catch
the sucker many a promoter has gone
out of sight forever because in a mo-
ment of enthusiasm he has written into
his prospectus we feel safe in promis-
ing-

  the week after jebberson  hick
began advertising podwolloger muni-
tions they advertised with equal pub-
licity camera king photoplay com-
pany capital stock 

  well said mrs jebberson to mrs
bunker the sunday morning the
camera king photoplay company
advertisement first appeared i guess
its pack the trunks for me

  goin to move asked mr bun-
ker

  oh yes sighed mrs jebberson
back to the champagne belt for me and
the colonel its perfectly awful the
colonel says how money is coming in
his partner mr hick is a wonder

  old hand at it i reckon suggested
mr bunker

  thats just what he aint said mrs
jebberson hes new and fresh at it
the colonel says thats why he is so
good he aint afraid to cut loose
 

the blue book magazine

  young man hey said mr bun-
ker

  twenty-eight said mrs jebber-

son but wise-wise as noah or who-
ever the feller was

  solomon suggested mrs bunker
seems like this fiscal agent ing was
a good business said mr bunker

  well ill tell you one thing said
mrs jebberson the office took in
forty-seven thousand dollars week be-
fore last from timpantee oil wells
alone and last week sixty-five thousand
from timpantee and podwolloger and
goodness knows what it will be this
week with this camera king added on
and the colonel is going west to-night
to pick up a couple of flivver copper
prospects so they can spring the rory
oboris copper company week after
next honest i feel all wined up al-
ready 

  colonel going to be gone long
asked mr bunker

  ten days said mrs jebberson
hes got to be back then to help
launch the ultra-oceanic mercantile
marine company

that evening mr bunker sat long
studying the advertisement of the
camera king photoplay company

  pa said mrs bunker aint you
ever goin to bed to-night

  in a minute ma in a minute said
grandpa im tryin to figger out what
kind o bunkin ill do this week

  oh said grandma i thought
maybe you was wastin your time read-
in the sunday paper if its business
pa you can set up as long as you like
well i guess i wont set up no
longer said jabez i guess i got a
kind of idea i can sort of work up
somehow

  the next morning mr bunker was
up bright and early he chuckled from
time to time as he drew on his socks
and laced his shoes and grandma
bunker as she dressed cast loving
glances at the bald top of his head for
she liked to see jabez happy in his
work after breakfast she gave him a
kiss and nestled his scarf neatly under
his overcoat collar

  well jabez she said i hope
you  have good luck dont do nothin

youll be ashamed of but if you have a
chance to bunk bunk gosjd and hard
a man liad ought to put his whole heart

in his work

 yes ma he answered  i
wouldnt feel honest if i slighted my

work

  once before mr bunker had had

occasion to do business with a small
printer in one of the side streets off
fifth avenue and now he went there
again the printer looked up as mr

bunker entered

 hello he said hows the
italian-american war supply com-
pany for that was the name mr
bunker had had printed on certain
stock-certificates at his former visit
come back to have a few more bales
of that stock printed

  why no i aint said mr bunker
as he unbuttoned his coat and removed
his scarf i reckon i wont bother
with no more of that stock i wonder
if you could print me up some nice
likely-lookin gold-mine stock

  sure  said the printer sure but
between you and me sir gold-mine
stock aint what folks are crazy for
now if you want to catch em now
you ought to have oil-well or copper
or motion-picture stock printed or
stick to this war-baby kind-munitions
or something like that look at how
this timpantee and podwolloger and
camera king is advertising

  seems like i did take notice of it
said mr bunker i guess maybe
youre right fashions change dont
they one time the easy marks dont
want nothin but gold mines and
another time copper mines and another
time the style runs to something else
but i dont know i been wearin the
same style of pants for goin on forty
years and i reckon i aint stylish any-
way i guess an old feller like me had
better stick to what hes used to in
my day gold-mine stock was what we
was buyin out to oroduna iowa and
i guess if its all the same to you ill
let you print me up a hunk of nice gold-
mine stock

 youre the boss said the
printer

  i sort of figgered on gold-mine
stock with some sort of name like
t jebberson



orobotoro gold mining company
something with say about five
hundred thousand dollars capital five
dollars par per share one hundred
thousand shares

  now listen said the printer
earnestly folks dont fall for five-
hundred-thousand-dollar-capital com-
panies any more you take my advice
and make it one hundred million or
something like that and-

  i kind o set my heart on havin it
one of them old-style conservative com-
panies said jabez so reluctantly that
the printer waved his hand

  have it your own way he said
hows this for the sample of the cer-
tificate 

  kind of nice aint it said mr
bunker as he examined the golden yel-
low engraved sheet i guess you can
print me up about a quire or two like

that

  and how do you spell this name
orobotoro or whatever it is

  spell it any way you want to said
mr bunker it dont make much
difference how its spelled i aint par-
ticlar

tvi atters being thus nicely
arranged mr bunker left the
affair in the hands of the printer and
when he returned later in the day the
printer had the stock-certificates ready
mr bunker took the package under
his arm and went home with it

  when mr bunker entered his room
he found mrs jebberson and grand-
ma bunker having tea together for the
last time before mrs jebbersons re-
moval to her superb apartments on
riverside drive

  well jabez asked his wife after
he had greeted her with a kiss and had
shaken mrs jebbersons hand have
you done good

  i got started ma he said cheer-
fully and he unwrapped the stock-cer-
tificates

  my them look real nice said mrs
bunker and mrs jebberson agreed

  they certainly ought to make the
heart of an easy mark happy she said
the colonel was saying to me that
the time for him to make money out
of this stock game was right now be-

cause everybody would jump into it as
soon as they saw what a lot of money
jebberson  hick were making if
this dont prove it i dont know what
does but i dont know who i would
rather see make money than your hus-
band mrs bunker only-

  only what asked mr bunker

  only i do think you hadnt ought to
have blown your cash for gold-mine
certificates gold mines are back num-
bers you might as well try to make
a broadway audience go crazy over a
black crook show as to get the easy
marks to buy gold-mine stock in this
day and age there was a time not so
long ago when the colonel went in for
gold-mine stocks but-never again
not until the style changes back to gold
mines anyway

 pshaw now said mr bunker
and grandma bunker looked glum for
just a moment until jabez winked at
her slyly then her faith renewed in
her husbands wisdom she was happy
again

  ma said mr bunker looking at
his thumb these here certificates aint
right dry yet and i dont want to fold
em up whilst theyre wet spose you
and mis jebberson help me spread
em out to dry

  mrs jebberson and grandma were
glad to be of assistance they spread
the certificates over the bed and over
the chairs until the room glowed with
yellow and then jabez seated himself
at the table and with a stub pencil be-
gan composing the document advertis-
ing the orobotoro gold mine stock
again and again he erased a word with
the greasy rubber in the end of the pen-
cil until at last he had the document
to his satisfaction then he set his
gold-rimmed spectacles firmly on his
nose and like a boy reading a school
composition of which he is proud he
read it aloud

 to dear old grandma bunker it
seemed a work of genius but when
jabez had completed the reading mrs
jebberson wrinkled her brow and
shook her head

  let me see it she said holding out
her hand i dont pretend to be up in
such things-if the colonel was here
he could tell you easily enough what is


the blue book magazine

wrong about it-but theres one tiling

i do know this is dangerous

  hey asked mr bunker dan-
gerous 

   this line here said mrs jebber-
son theres one thing the wife of a
man who has been selling stocks as long
as the colonel has gets to know in
spite of herself hick could tell you
hes a wise boy but i know enough to
know this is all wrong this line says
we guarantee enormous profits you
had better scratch that right out mr
bunker because that is where fraud
comes in and the post-office people
come right down on you

  mr bunker took the paper and held
the stubby pencil poised over it

  vou think thats enough to get me
into jail he asked

  oh absolutely said mrs jebber-
son and mr bunker ran his pencil
through the offending sentence

it was still early and mr bunker

	went out with the manuscript leav-
ing the ladies to their own devices
there was a small printer near at
hand for printing a circular was less
of a job than printing the stock-
certificatcs and mr bunker confided
the printing of the circular to him but
before he handed the manuscript to the
printer he added a line in which the
name of t jebberson appeared  and he
carefully rewrote the sentence we
guarantee enormous profits

  the printer noticed the offending
sentence the moment his eye fell on the
circular manuscript

  id leave this out he said indicat-
ing it maybe you know this game
but somebody told me once that that
was the sort of thing that gets all you
stock fellers into trouble

  leave it in said mr bunker
am right i suppose you know your
business said the printer but you
must have a jim-dandy of a mine if
you are willing to take a chance like
that you must have a mine that will
make good

  i guess maybe i have said mr
bunker

  and about how many of these do
you want printed  asked the printer

well now said mr bunker

beaming through his spectacles i
reckon one might get tom or some-
thing print up two of them 

  two

  yes two

  it wont cost any more to print a

hundred

  well i guess two will be about
plenty said mr bunker and he seated
himself cosily until the printer had set

up and struck off two copies of the
circular these mr bunker folded
carefully and placed in his pocket after
which he returned to his rooms

jrs jebberson had departed
ivi when mr bunker returned mrs
bunker was gathering up the orobo-
toro certificates which were now
thoroughly dry mr bunker wet one
of the printed circulars in the water
pitcher and hung it behind the gas-jet
after supper he and grandma spent a
pleasant evening folding the orobo-
toro stock-certificates

  the next day was tuesday and
opened with snow which turned to
slush as it fell by nine oclock one of
the pleasant new york drizzles had set
in but mr bunker did not care he
did not intend to go out until noon
all morning he sat at the table in his
room folding and refolding one of the
cirulars he had had printed until it
was limber at the creases and greasy
at the folds long before noon it
looked as if it had been carried in a
pocket many days and then mr bun-
ker placed it in his pocket from the
closet he dragged his empty oil-board
telescope valise and into this he threw
a few garments from the neat pile
of orobotoro gold mine shares he
selected enough to represent three
thousand dollars par value and these
he placed in the telescope valise on top
of the garments

  pa asked mrs bunker anxiously
be you goin to take a trip some-
wheres

  yes ma i be said mr bunker
his eyes twinkling us bunco men
dont ever know when we got to go
travelin

  are ye goin to be gone long ja-
bez asked his wife

  well i sort o figger on gettin back
t jebberson



in time for dinner to-night chuckled
mr bunker matter of fact ma i

from oroduna as you may say im an
old fool of an iowa farmer arrivin in
new york and gawkin up at the tall
buildings im a jay with straw dingin
to my heel and the stable smell not
quite wafted out o my clothes

  jabez said mrs bunker sharply

 well ma said mr bunker
seriously im goin down to wall
street to bunk folks there im goin
down to sell some o this orobotoro
gold mine stock before it gets fly-
specked dont you fret ma ill be
back in time for dinner

immediately after the light lunch

	mrs wimmer provided for such of
her boarders as did not take lunch else-
where mr bunker issued from the
boarding-house with his telescope
valise in his hand and walked to the
subway station here he boarded a
train for brooklyn bridge where he
changed cars to the brooklyn express
which as all the world must know
stops at wall street and other down-
town stations before it plunges under
the river at wall street mr bun-
ker left the train and climbed the
stairs to the street three boys one
newsboy and tw-o w u messengers
laughed at him the moment he reached
the street which is broadway

  unmindful of their mirth mr bun-
ker stood awhile looking up at the tall
buildings while the hurrying pedestrians
bumped into him and pushed him from
side to side he seemed confused and
lost when he next gave his attention to
the street and a policeman stepped up
to him

  well uncle he said to mr bun-
ker lost what are you looking

for

  mr bunker placed his telescope
valise on the walk and put a foot on
either side of it he searched his
pockets until he found a crumpled
clipping and unfolded it it was an
advertisement of the timpantee oil
wells company jebberson  hick
fiscal agents

  where kin i find them folks at
he asked

  the policeman grinned it was not
his duty to steer innocent country folk
away from jebberson  hick he took
mr bunker by the arm and pointed
down wall street

  you see that building down that
street  he said thats wall street
and thats the building youre looking
for you go into that building and
youll find a man there in uniform
hes the elevator starter you ask him
where to find jebberson  hick and
hell tell you dont be afraid to go
right into the elevator theyre safe
those elevators and when you get to
the floor where the elevator man tells
you to get out you just look around
and youll find the name on a door

  much obliged officer said mr
bunker and insisted on shaking the
officers hand he picked up his bur-
den and crossed broadway and entered
the gully called wall street as the
policeman had said he would find the
elevator starter so he found him and
in a few moments he was before the
entrance to jebberson  hicks offices
on the eighteenth floor of the building
he opened the door cautiously and
entered

	 here were some eighteen or
twenty clerks in the office and
many of them seemed to have nothing
to do but open mail and take out checks
and money-orders boys were carry-
ing heaps of these from desk to desk
and through an open door mr bun-
ker had a view of seeming dozen of
bookkeepers and other clerks there
was an unending rattle of typewriters
and jingling of telephones and call-
bells across the front of the office
shutting mr bunker off from this busy
enclosure was a mahogany railing with
a small gate and just inside the gate
sat a young woman alert saucy and
overdressed for her position as mr
bunker stood staring she turned her
head toward him and he walked up to
the gate

  hooja wanta see she asked

  mr bunker looked past her at the
clerks

  i dont see no sight of him in there


the blue book magazine

  he said maybe this aint where he

stays at	

  whatziz name asked the girl
well now said mr bunker i
reckon its febberson tall fine-lookin
feller with a sort of goatee and a
reddish face looks sort of like a con-
fedratc genral	

  its jebberson said the girl
sowta town

 pshaw now said mr bunker
regret fully jebberson hey yes
thats thename well i guess maybe
it dont matter i guess maybe you can
give me my money back

  the look the young woman gave mr
bunker indicated that in her opinion
he must be the prize easy mark of the
world money back who ever heard
of such a thing

  fyou gottany timpantee r pod-
wolloger you better hang onto it s
goinup she said briskly

  well now i dare say maybe youre
right said mr bunker but i aint got
any of them stocks ive got oroboto-
ro gold mine stock a whole hunk
of it and seein as mister jebberson
said when i bought it that it was goin
to make a lot of money and as it aint
made a dum cent i reckoned maybe
hed buy it back bill ransom hes
the county attorney out to oroduna
iowa and he says all i got to do is show
a post-office detective the letter i got
from mister jebberson and i can have
mister jebberson jailed but i dont
want to do nothin as mean as that less

i	have to but i guess i cant spend
no great time around new york im
figgerin on startin back to oroduna
to-morrow and i guess if mr jebber-
son aint in town ill go to the post
office and-

  staminute maybe mr ilick 
see you said the young lady and she
hurried into an office opening into the
main room mr hick came out not a
minute later he walked right up to
the gate and opened it and invited mr
blinker inside and led him into the pri-
vate office he waved mr bunker in-
to a chair and thrust a cigar at him

jr- mick was a brisk young man
with a face as hard ami keen as a
flint his eyes were like bits of metal

jebberson  llick were making money
so rapidly he was almost frightened

it was jouring in on fhem by every
mail and he saw new deluges of money
threatening as soon as the new ventures
were launched he was keen and he
had a high-priced attorney go over
every form letter and advertisement to
make sure jebberson  hick were well
within the law but the rapid growth of
the firms mail had attracted the atten-
tion of the post-office authorities and
he had no doubt his firm was being in-
vestigated it was evident that if the
golden flood was to continue for a
while jebberson  hick must bear a
decent reputation

  whats this miss miggs is telling
me he snapped did you buy some
stock from jebberson when where
what kind of stock

  out to oroduna iowa by mail
said mr bunker unstrapping his tele-
scope valise bout eight years ago
three thousand dollars orobotoro
gold mine

   never heard of it said mr hick
well there she is said mr bun-
ker slapping the pile of stock certifi-
cates on mr hicks desk never paid
me a cent and heres the letter mr jeb-
berson sent me it says right here we
guarantee enormous profits 

   the swelled-up old idiot said mr
hick angrily glaring at the crease-
worn circular that mr bunker had had
printed monday afternoon orobotoro
gobi a nice name thats what a
soft-brained fellow like jebberson does
when he tries it on his own hook eight
years ago 	

  well i reckon it was about eight
years ago said mr bunker twas
the year my red cow got into the tur-
nip-patch and-

  i dont want to hear about vouf
tumip-patch snapped mr hick
you say you paid three thousand dol-
lars for this stuff

   thats what it says on the certifi-
cates said mr bunker leaning for-
ward to take one of them

  oh tut cxclaimed mr hick
angrily you wait here - under-
stand 

  with the bundle of orobotoro shares
and the circular letter mr hick went
t jebberson



into another room he closed the door
in a chair in this room sat an elderly
man with an unusually large head al-
most as bald as mr bunkers head

  judge said mr hick heres a
nice business theres a jay in my
office who brought in this stock and this
circular some of jebbersons bril-
liant work read that circular

  the judge read it slowly shaking his
head as he read it

  penal offense hick he said

  yes and i had an inkling jebber-
son had been in some dusky games
said hick angrily he swore his
skirts were clear but i had a feeling
i tell you a young man shouldnt tie
up with a man as old as jebberson who
knows what will pop tip out of his past
well

  hick said the lawyer buy him
off buy his stock back you might
say wait until jebberson comes back
and let him buy his own dead horses
-but can you take the chance how
much are you and jebberson taking in
now ten thousand a day twelve
thousand you and jebberson are well
inside the law in these new deals
theyre making you a mint of money
you can afford to buy up all the old
dead horses jebberson has floating
around and you cant afford to have
any scandal strike this firm now buy
him off

  my idea exactly said hick and
being a man of action he walked back
into his own office

  you say you want three thousand
for this stock  he asked

  well i sort of thought- mr bun-
ker began

  ill buy it from you for three
thousand and not a cent more said
mr hick take it or leave it

  mr bunker sighed

  ill take it he said but i feel sort
of cheated the letter said enormous
profits was guaranteed

  and the price includes the circular
letter said mr hick

  well i guess you can have that if
you want it said jabez taint worth
nothin to me if you was to pay me in
cash i guess i can throw in the let-
ter

  mr hick pressed one of the numer-
ous buttons at the side of his desk

  brownlee he said to the man who
appeared in answer bring me three
thousand in bills and charge it to ad-
vertising expense

yyhen mr bunker had pocketed
 his three thousand dollars and re-
strapped his telescope valise and dis-
appeared down the elevator mr hick
entered the judges office

  a thing like that we cant afford to
have get out he said

  no said the judge who was still
scanning the circular you are right
hick a thing like that you cant
afford to have noised around why
hello

  he bent his head closer over the cir-
cular

  what is it asked hick

  look here said the judge see
this printers mark on the bottom of
this circular p murphy printer 
w  street new york hick there
wasnt any printer there eight years
ago there wasnt any printer there
five years ago there wasnt any
printer there two years ago i know
because i own that property two
years ago that was a vacant lot

  stung said hick worked for
easy marks by a jay

  yes stung buncoed said the
judge and hick thats another thing
a prosperous firm of fiscal agents cant
afford to have noised around

 when mr bunker returned home
grandma bunker was already in the
dining-room he took his seat at her
side and opening his napkin tucked
it in his collar and spread it across his
broad front

  well jabez said mrs bunker i
guess by the way you look you done
some business

  yes ma said mr bunker im
right proud of it too i stang the wall
street folks themselves to-day i sold
em them certificates you and me folded
last night

  well i dunno as theyd feel bad
about it said grandma bunker
most anybodyd be glad to own them
certificates-theyre so pretty

another jabez bunker story next month
tie woman rose wearily from
her battered chair by the un-
painted pine table and regu-
lated the air-valves of the
assaying furnace she had been beau-
tiful once-was still in a way despite
the pinch of poor nour-
ishment in her cheek and
the film of disappointed
hope and wrecked pride
in her eyes

   in the chalk-lined pot
of the furnace the fumes
from the roasting ore
bubbled up soggily an
atmosphere redolent
with arsenic added if
addition were possible
to the squalid discom-
fort of the little shacks single room
the gas spiced to a nauseating degree
with sulphur and antimony curled
about the ship-lap walls rose lazily
along the angle of the squat tar-papered
roof and found egress in a dozen poorly
patched leaks

  a rough bunk was built along one
side of the cabin near by a sheet-
iron stove discharged more smoke

  robert j casey is a

       new writer whose stories
   are sure to attract immediate
   attention novelty vivid
   color a sledge-hammer power
   -these qualities make them
   impressive indeed this is
   one of his best others will
   appear regularly in the
   blue book magazine

through its fuel door than through the
tin stovepipe picks pans and drills
ore-specimens and acid-carboys littered
the corners of the slab floor so far
the discomfort was merely that of the
pioneer the advance agent of civili-
zation

  the bedding was
cheap and worn the
clothing which hung to
nails behind the door
was of a style little
adapted to the needs of
the hills and ragged be-
yond hope of further
patches a five-pound
flour-jar a handful of
beans in a broken cup
and the remnants of a
slab of salt pork on a shelf over the
stove constituted the commissary the
handles of the mining implements had
been broken and often repaired with
rusty wire-and this was not the hard-
ship of the pioneer but poverty

  as the woman turned away from the
furnace she looked at her gown a
paris creation of black velvet and satin
and she laughed poverty has varied


the pay streak



manifestations she realized that she
could not afford the luxury of a calico
apron to cover the ruins of her former
grandeur

  her hair was blonde-ruddy in the
flickering light from the little crater
her fingers were more like those of a
pianist than the blunt calloused hands
of a mining camp drudge after a
while the fumes of sulphur and anti-
mony ceased to rise from the pot she
sank back in her chair laid her head in
her arms on the table and waited

a muffled step in the deep snow
before the door aroused her and
she was animation again as a stooped
figure in mackinaw sweater and high
boots shuffled in with the tails of the
blizzard still clinging to him

  the man threw a few packages onto
the table and dropped limply to a box
before the stove

  it was a bad day to-day nell he
said

  she smoothed her bodice rearranged
a rosette of black on her breast brushed
back a few strands of hair from her
forehead and smiled at him inscru-
tably

  its always a bad day isnt it
harry she asked

  he stared at the glowing door of the
tin stove as if he had not heard her

  dont you know harry i get so
tired of it all sometimes she went on
you and your bad days have ceased
to be interesting even as disappoint-
ments-

  he turned sharply the light of some
repressed emotion in his eyes but even
as he looked at her the fire died and
he drooped down again into a shape-
less bundle

  please dont talk that way nell he
pleaded therell be a strike some
day-well be rich

  rich she laughed look at the
queen of your house harry cascade
city would turn over backward if i
walked into town in this rig and im
wearing it because my body wasnt
brought up to stand cold and the last
of my rags are too thin to keep the chill
away rich its always been that

  always money was just ahead to-
day we could eat abominable salt pork

and such delicacies as might be turned
out of a pot to-morrow it would be
back to the champagne again your
td-morrows and your pay dirt are all
made of the same stuff we never
quite reach them

  nell he begged please dont i
cant have you talking that way
it-

  she interrupted him calmly and in-
sistently and dispassionately disregard-
ing his protest as though it never had
been made

  ive grown rather used to it con-
sidering my reputation as a voluptuary
ive kept my form fairly well in spite
of crazy beds and a mans work and
nothing to eat whats more remark-
able ive kept my mind-thats the
wonderful part of it-ive kept my
mind

  when we first moved up the canon
and into this shack i thought id go
insane just from the loneliness of it
at night when the wind would sing in
the pines i used to hear the great organ
in the cathedral childish wasnt it
it seemed as if the wind could play
nothing but dirges

  then when you built that little dam
and the board at the top got to rattling
i would imagine it was an automobile
engine it sounded just like that i
would lie awake and listen to it all
night and i could see myself going to
the opera with other women sitting in
the cafes living as it was intended i
should live

  but somehow i have managed to
keep sane she stretched her slim
hands out to the furnace again i am
sane enough to see the humor in your
bad days and to take your promises
with salt

there was quiet for a moment save
 for the whispering of the wind as
the blizzard sifted in through the chinks
in the wall and the snow-spray from the
leaky roof spattered on the stove

  i saw a man killed to-day the man
said abruptly he seemed suddenly to
have grown very old despite the youth-
ful evidences of his smooth cheeks and
black hair

  i saw a man killed to-day he was
expecting it-knew he was going to be


the blue book magazine

killed-told me so caught his arm in
a conveyor and was dragged onto the
sawsit was terrible nell

  you have no business in a place
like that commented the woman
without sympathy its making you
maudlin

  they pay a dollar and a half at the
mill he retorted i suppose if i stay
there ill go like john did he felt it
i feel it-but its a dollar and a half a
day

  she shrugged her shoulders

  did you bring back any lead she
asked the man hung his head again

  of course you didnt harry she
observed in mock solicitude oh well
its like you you poor dear we have
a good assaying furnace we can af-
ford to keep that but lead is much too
expensive-

  the man leaped up overturning the
box as he arose

  some strength of character buried
under the harrowing memories of a
none too remote past was reaching the
surface his body straightened his
shoulders grew broader the down-
curving ends of his weak mouth sud-
denly were transformed into a tight
straight determined line

  im tired of this nell he breathed
harshly as she drew her gown closer
and posed languidly and with auda-
cious unruffled vanity against the
table

  youre not getting anything that
isnt coming to you he went on you
arent suffering any more than i am
i took a job in the sawmill for the win-
ter just so that you might have a little
better food and maybe some decent
clothes i could have lived i could
have worked on what little we had
left

  there neednt he any of this stage
play about loyalty between us youve
stayed here bccause youve hoped that
the claim would show a pay-streak-
not because of any love for me you
married me for the same reason-the
pay-streak i had money position
prospects you werent making any
sacrifices marrying a combination like
that

  we went broke because you kept
two jumps ahead of the bank-account

it wasnt any expense of mine that
brought the smash youre here be-
cause you want to be youre poor
because youve made yourself poor
you have a chance to be rich some day
and you sneer at it-

  dont you think you are forgetting
yourself harry dear she asked dryly
i may have been a mercenary crea-
ture-maybe not-thats beside the
question i could have done better
im entitled to three meals a day and
enough clothes to keep me covered
theres this to my loyalty ive gone
through starvation with you ive
shared any hardships you may have
suffered ive had no reward except
your doubtful promises

  the last ttace of the mans self-
control vanished he smote the table
with a heavy fist until the furnace shook
and threatened to spill the metal out on
the floor

  loyalty i saw fred greaves last
letter to you he grated i read it
loyalty youd go to him to-morrow
only he wouldnt have you and couldnt
give you any better support than youre
getting now if he would youre no
better than a woman of the streets
they at least make no pretense regard-
ing their profession

  something in the womans attitude
bade him pause

  her face still was passionless her
eyes still coldly unconcerned but her
bosom was heaving and her hands had
clenched until her knuckles were white

  ill kill you for that she said
quietly

  he did not answer her

m ell rial marked the close of the
  incident with a toss of her shoul-
ders as her husband threw aside his
mackinaw and cap and helped himself
to a cupful of strange soup from a pot
that sizzled on the stove

  she took down a handful of car-
tridges from a belt that hung behind the
door extracted the bullets with mon-
key-wrench and pliers and granulated
the metal with a heavy file she
weighed the filings and then poured
them into the ore-pot to flux the
metal

  you might go out and get some
the pay streak



stove-wood if your spirited nature
would permit the effort she reminded
her husband 

  he arose mechanically and departed
as she stripped a package of nails of
its newspaper wrapping and settled her-
self in her chair to read the month-old
news

   no sooner had the door closed behind
him than she was alert her wedding
ring was off her finger in an instant
she laid it on the iron block that served
rial as an anvil and in another minute
had hacked it into six pieces with ham-
mer and cold-chisel

  five pieces she hid under the slab
floor the sixth she tossed into the
furnace she was back in her chair
with the paper before her again when
rial staggered in with an armful of
fuel

  presently the woman raised the pot
from the furnace and busied herself in
the preparation of cupels little conical
cups of pressed bone-ash for the final
step in the assay very carefully she
set them in the place where the pot had
been when the molten metal had
cooled she lifted the spongelike mass
from the vessel with a pair of tongs
and laid it on the anvil she broke
away the slag with a hammer disclos-
ing a bright ball of gold-silver-lead
alloy which she cut into several
pieces

  rial looked on in fascination he
could not make an assay himself he
never had been able to acquire the pa-
tience and accuracy it was like nell
to succeed in such things she was
painstaking in matters of detail what
she set out to do she did thoroughly

the woman distributed the metal
among the cupels she regulated
the flame again and sat down to wait
until the lead should be absorbed
when the fumes rose straight upward
she cut down the flame lest some of the
precious metal might be carried away
with the base if the currents failed to
rise at all she gave the blaze more air
as the buttons filmed over and the
dark mists circled about the little
cups in their ascension she remained
motionless

   rial peered forward in eager interest

each day this was the climax of his
search the recompense for his double
burden of labor usually the end was
disappointment the cupels cooled to
show a blackened center where the lead
had been and only enough gold to spur
him on in his search for more

  nells face was expressionless there
was neither haste nor interest in her
movements as she adjusted the fur-
nace it was always that way she
made an assay with the same precision
and disinterestedness that might have
been displayed by a fatigued physician
performing a routine autopsy the
work alone was her concern and then
only as a matter of established routine
timbuctoo might have been the sole
beneficiary in the result for all the visi-
ble impression it made upon her

  presently rial abandoned his effort
to remain in his corner by the stove
he arose kicked aside the box on which
he had been sitting and peered down
into the furnace he blinked unbeliev-
ingly and gasped

  tiny points of brilliance seemed to
float in the circling fumes at the center
of each cupel

  weve hit it girl he exulted
weve hit it that ore ought to run
five hundred dollars to the ton-five
hundred dollars

  then he fainted among the chisels
and pans beside the bunk nell paid
no attention to him she completed the
assay by extracting the gold-tinged
metal globules from the cones and drop-
ping them into a glass of nitric acid to
eat out the silver she smiled when
later she weighed the button of gold
and found it neither more nor less than
the piece of ring which she had dropped
into the pot

 ext morning rial walked down
the railroad track in the canon to
the mill drew his pay and resigned
he had to take a time-check-for the
mill company had difficulty meeting the
demands of the pay-roll even once a
month especially in winter from
there he went to cascade city where
a genial saloonkeeper cashed the check
at a ten-per-cent discount with the
forty dollars remaining he bought ten
dollars worth of flour five dollars
the blue book magazine

worth of salt pork and twenty-five dol-
lars worth of dynamite

  bill seymour saddle-maker under-
taker prospector and pistol-merchant
got the contract for the dynamite be-
ing a remnant of die old order he asked
no questions but took the twenty-five
dollars he arranged for the delivery
of the explosive via the logging rail-
road the next day

  having thus observed the etiquette
of the age he represented he was at
liberty to talk as much as he pleased-
which he proceeded to do no sooner
than his customer had stepped out the
front door

mothing spreads faster than the

	 rumor of a gold strike

  bill stepped across the street and
held converse with nate mcintosh a
banker who was strongly suspected of
having obtained his start in life by
robbing sluice-boxes whatever the
grounds for the charge it left nate
with a reputation as a mining expert
second to none in the black hills

  is there any gold up cascade creek
within ten miles of cascade asked
bill abruptly

  nate bit off a generous portion from
a black plug before replying such
matters could not be decided hastily

  i guess there is he replied at
length you could pan a couple of
dollars a day out of the creek right
here ill bet on it

  bill shook his head impatiently he
had heard it all before

  dont talk like the commercial
club he counseled im not askin
you this just to hear myself or you
im after stuff worth goin after-
a real high-grade free-milling prop-
osition

  there aint any judged nate but
i couldnt say that definite you can
find pretty near anything in the black
hills except banana-trees all the
good claims is taken anyway so whats
the use of worryin about it 

  thats die way i look at it ex-
actly agreed seymour i thought
i d taken a squint at everything be-
tween here and mystic but theres
been some funny doins up the creek
and ive been a-thinkin

  somehow the story circulated be-
fore rial strode out of town with the
first installment of his food purchase
strapped across his shoulders the side-
walks were filled with men who stared
at him queerly until the sweep of a new
snowstorm swallowed him up some
of these were argonauts of the pioneer
days more of them fleecers of the new
they hoped that the impossible had
happened that a gold-strike had been
made up the creek-not that any claims
worth while remained for the taking
but because a gold-strike meant a new
financial status in the community
more money to be spent and more as-
sistance needed in the spending

  close on rials trail as he left rapid
was bill seymour bill skirted the
back streets of the town to hangmans
hill and down the side of it unob-
served he carried a queer outfit-a
blanket a sack of provisions and a pair
of binoculars seymour went not as a
prospector but as-well as an ob-
server

  he grinned as he saw rial fighting
the wind and snow at the entrance of
the canon if a gold-strike had been
made he intended to be the first out-
sider to share in the results if the
signs proved false he would not have
taken up his task in vain-it meant
something to be able to take up the
insignia of a forgotten youth and live
once more the beloved eld days and
it was history in the hills that the rumor
of a gold-strike meant an inevitable sale
of coffins

  rial was too much absorbed in the
task of keeping his footing once the
narrow canon threw the blizzard in his
face to notice the older but more agile
man following the winding track behind
him

dtal dragged a few saplings to the
  head of his shaft and constructed a
rude snow-shield then he set about
rediscovering the lead whence had come
the wonderful specimen nell appeared
to have forgotten their recent encoun-
ter she encouraged him

  clad in an impromptu working-skirt
made of canvas a pair of her husbands
boots a discarded mackinaw and a fur
cap she appeared at die head of the
the pay streak



shaft and held the drill for him when
he commenced operations

  it was bitterly cold the pine-clad
mountain reared away on one side
blending with the gray of a winter sky
a red stone cliff towered on the other
the trees muffled by the heavy coating
of snow that made them look like sage-
brush were strangely silent the dirge
that nell hated had ceased to sound
instead the wind passed on with a
pulsation felt rather than heard adding
fear to infinite loneliness

   nell heated the point of a drill in the
rough forge near the head of the shaft
and beat out the point to an edge with
a hammer then she directed it as her
husband plied the sledge after each
smash she moved the implement a quar-
ter turn steadily it dug down into the
rock

  it was work that presupposed silence
both seemed to feel the influence of the
canon and to recognize the futility of
words the smash smash smash of
the sledge was thrown back from the
red-stone walls in a cannonade it
sounded sacrilegious to nell it was
like biting downward stroke by stroke
turn by turn through the marble floor
of a great gothic church-ever ad-
vancing to break through presently
into a musty crypt

v fter a while the hole in the rock
was partly filled with dust rial
paused perspiring despite the chill of
the gale and the beating snow and nell
scooped out the debris with a long-
handled spoon

  when enough of a hole had been
drilled the man tamped in a charge of
dynamite and inserted a fuse the ex-
plosion was another desecration the
roar of it through the pent-up gulch
left both of them deafened and sent
snow tumbling down the hillside in a
miniature avalanche

  then they shoveled away the wreck-
age and went back to the drill working
down a fraction of an inch at a time
toward the gold-veined heart of the
stone so it continued all during the
day and long after the early nightfall
had turned the half-light of the canon
to impenetrable gloom from a tiny
cave at die top of the opposite cliff bill

seymour watched the performance
through his field-glasses as long as the
light permitted he cooked his frugal
supper over a carefully shielded fire as
the smashing of the drill echoed up out
of the canon below and he wondered
what it all meant why was the woman
urging the man on so pitilessly

a piece of ore was roasting in the
 assaying furnace when rial arrived
at the shack nell who had left the
drill only when his unsteadiness at the
sledge imperiled her head had slipped
out of the canvas skirt and mackinaw
now she stood radiant in her black vel-
vet-a creature from another world a
debutante in a slum all this was a
long foreseen detail in her plans in
playing a game with a stacked deck of
cards she told herself it is customary
for the stacker to deal himself a good
hand

  the inevitable bean soup was cooking
on the tin stove the rest of his sup-
per nell informed her husband he
must prepare for himself

  only a little piece of the ring had
gone into the furnace this time nell
was methodical and had mapped out in
advance the complicated steps of what
promised to be a long campaign the
attainment of her object meant much to
her nothing could be considered a
sacrifice that contributed toward that
end

  it shows only about two dollars a
ton to-night she announced as she
weighed the button at the completion of
the assay think we could have
missed the vein

  we tested all that top ore he ob-
jected im sure last nights sample
was an outcropping from the cliff
well get it to-morrow girl well be
rich

  her only reply was a smile-a smile
in which the man saw nothing of evil
purpose

  rial spread out a blanket on the
floor rolled himself in it and fell asleep
almost as soon as he had stretched out
his legs

  nell changed her gown for her non-
descript working costume and lay down
on the bunk without undressing

  the next day the volume of the wind


the blue book magazine

and the chill of the blizzard increased
but behind the rough wall of saplings
the woman and her husband went on
with their drilling

  that night there was another assay
and another announced result of two
dollars a ton the woman aching in
everj bone fought with herself as
fatigue periled determination she
held her eyes open by a superhuman
effort until rial was snoring in ex-
haustion on the floor then she arose
and set the alarm-clock

at midnight bill seymour snug in
his cave with the embers of his fire
at his feet and the bliz-
zard warded off by a
jutting rock at the en-
trance to the hole was
aroused f rom sound
slumber by a dynamite
blast

  he crawled to the
edge of the cliff and
looked down in bewild-
erment there was a
light in rials shack a
fire was being scattered
in the grip of the gale
over the snow not far
from where he knew the
shaft to be

  then as he listened
came the amazing sound of sledge strik-
ing drill-the metallic note that rose
above the muffled noises of the storm

  they must have something down
there he puzzled himself either
theyve hit pay dirt or theyre mighty
close to it-or that woman is up to
something mighty queer

at the edge of the shaft the weary
woman mechanically turned the
drill sometimes her shrieking muscles
rebelled and her arm was unsteady at
such times she was in danger of losing
a hand under the descending hammer
iet whenever the man showed signs of
wearying she urged him on

 we cant stop now she pleaded

  we cant stop the gold is here we
must find it

  presently he got to repeating it as a
sort of refrain which he only half
understood

  must go on he chanted sleepily as
he swung the sledge gold then
nell knew she had won

eur days bill seymour looked on

	he was far from understanding the
activity at the rial shaft he would
have visited the claim and taken sam-
ples but he dared not there seemed
to be  regularity about the work of
the man and woman he watched all
day they worked and far into the
night-then at ten oclock midnight or
two oclock they began again

  their working days started at day-
break-or the morning twilight which
answered for dawn in
the canon they made
no stops for food

  bill could not make it
out gradually the mys-
tery of the affair gave
way in his mind before
the certainty that the
rials had won where all
the prospectors since
 had failed he
went back to town for
more supplies and con-
fided his theories in
nate before he was
well out of town on his
way back to his conning
tower cascade was pre-
paring for a new gold-boom

  after a week nell so worn-out physi-
cally and mentally that she feared ill-
timed illness might interrupt her plans
abandoned her place at the drill and
the downward movement into the rock
progressed less rapidly she slept all
the first day of her reprieve

  she was awake and had an excep-
tionally palatable supper on the table
when the man staggered into the shack
at nightfall he tell asleep in his chair
as soon as he had finished his meal
she dragged him to the bunk rolled
him comfortably in a blanket and
braved the storm to get stove-wood
that he mieht not be uncomfortable
she laughed at her inconsistency but
she realized that although her object
precluded sentiment its ghost might
prove acceptable for the success of
her experiment it was necessary that
the subject be in a receptive mood

  she did not go through the formula
of an assay a bit of the ring- melted
down to a button produced the result
without the labor

  at midnight she lighted the furnace
strewed crumbs of slag about the table
sprinkled nitric acid on the floor until
the fumes were thick through the room
and then awakened her husband

   its fifty dollars to-night she told
him excitedly see there is the
button

  he rolled out of his bunk in a daze
of fatigue and sleeplessness the gold-
lust was battling with exhaustion

  maybe wed better try to finance it
right away he suggested

  she shook her head

  you cant raise money on one button
of pay get the specimens get the ore
find the lead were close to it

  then the dullness of fatigue faded
from his face once more his eyes
brightened unnaturally and he reached
for his tools

   well get it girl he said well
get it the gold is there well find
it

  so he went out into the storm and
forced his aching body to its endless
task

  half an hour later bill seymour was
roused from his rest by another dyna-
mite explosion

  it has been said that pocket-mining-
the search for an elusive vein of high-
grade-is the most fascinating sport in
the world because the prize is always
just ahead if the miner sinks his shaft
a mile he cant quit there because the
vein or the pocket may be a mile and
one foot below the surface so he
keeps on until his strength or his
pocket-book or his mind gives out

the tenth day mr william seymour
grew inqmsitive he resolved
to make certirfn whether or not the
golden days had returned and he clam-
bered down from his cave at first
fortune favored him he saw rial
hunched up to ward off the ungentle
caress of the driving snow plodding
down the canon in the direction of
town

  seymour judged correctly that he
was on his way to bring in the rest of

the supplies he had ordered with the
dynamite the woman he believed to
be negligible

  the snow was swirling about the
shaft-head as he emerged from the pro-
tection of the cafion rocks and started
the climb toward rials claim up
above him the tumbling ledges so char-
acteristic of black hills topography
jutted out of the wall a layer of black
a layer of white-a funereal band he
reached the top of the cliff as he had
calculated near the mine he picked
up a few bits of rock at the ore-dump
and leisurely surveyed his surround-
ings there was no one in sight and
every chance seemed to favor the suc-
cess of his effort

  then a bullet sang by his ear and
the canon echoed the crack of a rifle
that convinced seymour he lay flat
on his stomach and slid precipitously
to a safer place among the brakes
then he too took the trail to town

ceymour knew every foot of the
gulch from his old expeditions as a
prospector and the land-bartering days
that succeeded the gold rush

  for years no assessment work had
been done on the little claim in the
brakes immediately adjoining rials
shaft therefore it had reverted to
the government and had remained
public property pending the arrival of
some adventurous soul unacquainted
with the fate of its previous holders
as a matter of precaution seymour
filed on it-much to the wonder and
amusement of the populace-and ar-
ranged for an investigating expedi-
tion

  rial was still in town when the
news of seymours unaccountable folly
spread over main street sundry at-
tempts to question him were unsuc-
cessful

  there is promise in the canon he
would observe after the tight-lipped
fashion of the two-gun days some
day im going to hit it rich and opin-
ion was divided over whether he -was a
prophet or merely insane

  rial shouldered a sack of flour and
started up the cafion again that after-
noon not knowing that the eyes of the
city were on him as he passed through


the blue book magazine

the gateway under hangmans hill
after him went seymour and with
seymour three armed men

  rial stumbled and fell half a dozen
times in the seven-mile walk back to
his claim seymour and his men would
have helped him but they feared to dis-
close their presence or their mission
they kept well behind wondering each
time the man stumbled whether he
would ever get up again

  the sixth time rial crumpled down
under the weight of the flour and mine
supplies he left a mark there was a
little pool of red in the snow when the
pursuers came to the spot a few min-
utes afterward

three tanned men in mackinaws

	selected for their ability to hit a
penny at a hundred yards and a some-
what picturesque attitude toward life
camped in the snow on the heights of
the canon covering both sides of the
rial shaft

  behind a rock on the floor of the
gulch seymour squatted expectantly
he was unarmed he meant no harm
in his attempt to learn the value of the
claim next that on which he had just
paid an entry-fee but he did not believe
in taking chances on being killed
hence the grim bodyguard

  rial went immediately to his task

  the smash smash smash of hammer
and drill grown weaker since seymour
first had listened to the sound was
echoing now from somewhere beneath
the surface the watcher in the brakes
judged that the shaft must have been
sunk several feet

  at times the men on the cliff-walls
saw a woman in black velvet her head
and shoulders wrapped in a fur scarf
picking her way with difficulty through
the drifts between the shaft and the
hut seymour watched her curiously
for there was that in her driving of her
husband that perplexed him

  once the man appeared he said
something to her and she laughed at
him he strode angrily past her into
the shack and emerged with a handful
of food which he devoured as he bur-
ned back to his drilling the woman
still smiling stared after him then
she went inside

  at seven oclock that night the watch-
ers clustered with seymour behind the
rock the sound of the drill ceased
the door of the shack obned the
woman her golden head uncovered ap-
peared in the doorway with a lantern
the light moved along quickly though
uncertainly toward the mine

  two minutes later there was an ex-
plosion that sent a shiver through the
rocky spine of the hills a shower of
pebbles beat down upon the watchers
and they were buried neck-deep in
snow they waited expectantly for a
resumption of the drilling but there
was no further sound coming from the
shaft

  i guess she got him that time re-
marked bill ominously and he began to
lead his men up the mountain-side

two forms lay still on the snow
 when the quartet stepped into the
ring of light thrown by the flickering
lantern the womans arms were about
rial who lay face downward a muck
of broken rock was scattered over them

  the womans hair fluffed out by the
wind was like a flame in the unsteady
light against the snow a trickle of red
ran down from a gash in her fore-
head

  i dont make it out observed bill
seymour uncomprehendingly she
must have pulled him out of it

  as he spoke rial loosened himself
from his wifes grasp and lurched to
his feet one of the armed three
forced a draught of whisky through his
white lips and steadied him in the wind
he did not seem to realize what had
happened

  i was too tired to climb out he
repeated to himself in a dazed mono-
tone too tired then she came-

  seymours men gave him no more
attention they carried the woman to
the hut and laid her on the cot un-
sentimental hands washed the wound in
her head with turpentine the pioneers
only antiseptic and in a few minutes
she too opened her eyes

  she stared about in horror caught
sight of rial smiled and dropped back
onto her pillow

  better luck to-morrow boy she
greeted him with a shaking voice for
the pay streak



answer he dropped to his knees beside
the cot drew her as close as his
withered strength would permit and
sobbed convulsively she tried to push
him away

  dont dont she moaned i can t

have you pitying mei tried to

kill you

  hush girl he interrupted
brokenly

  but she refused to be silenced
when you doubted me she persisted
i said id kill you i meant to i
tried to i starved you forced you
to work then-then i
couldnt go on with
it-

there was a mo-

	ment of tense si-
lence but rial didnt
rise from his knees or
loosen his embrace

bill seymour and the
armed three looked on
the scene in stark amaze-
ment

  better go get grub an a doctor
bill instructed one of the men for
once in his checkered existence he could
think of no other comment

  poor little girl mumbled rial
well hit the pay to-morrow ill sell
out and then well start all over
again

  bill had been toying with a piece of
ore he stopped suddenly and threw
himself into the tableau here was a
situation he could understand

  now youre talkin he observed
im goin to put sheep in here this
year ill give you a thousand dollars
for the claim

  the man blinked at him in aston-
ishment

  a thousand dollars he repeated
food and a home girl lets chuck
it

  nell rial raised herself on her elbow
and peered across the tattered blanket
at seymour

   the midas touch
  another of robert j
  caseys striking stories will
  appear in the september
  blue book magazine
  like the foregoing it is a tale
  of the black hills country
  and to an even more marked
  degree it shows the unique
  power of this new writer

  ask him what hes holding in his
hand harry she directed her hus-
band seymour did not indicate that
he understood the significance of her
command

  open your hand she pursued
put that piece of rock on the table

  bill followed her instructions with a
sheepish grin he knew better than to
back a pair of deuces against a royal
flush

  that she explained as the stones
clattered against the assaying furnace
is natural cemenl our claim is worth
perhaps forty thousand
dollars am i right
mr visitor

  bein a bidder for
the claim i aint talking
loud lady said the
miner unabashed but
bein the sole owner
manager an stockholder
of the claim just next
door im willin to ad-
mit it aint bad lookin
he grinned again

  the gypsum and shale are close to-
gether he drawled an its just so
good that you wouldnt had any hard
luck if youd knowed about it a month
ago

  the woman smiled strangely

  i did know about it a month ago
mr visitor she answered evenly
then she lay back on the cot and set-
tled her head comfortably in her
husbands arms

  bill and his cohorts stepped gingerly
out of the cabin

  knowed it a month ago he rumi-
nated as he faced the blizzard again
knowed it a month ago an starved
so she could croak a man because he
starved her all i gotta say is that
mines an women is about the same kind
o proposition yuh never can tell how
theyre goin to pan out

  and in the shack on the cliff another
man was thinking though not quite so
coherently the same thing
c sour infield

alnonblf

there is nothing in the world
just like big- eague baseball
every year when the worlds
series comes along and the
papers are full of the tremendous
receipts and baseball reporters who
have to have something to write about
fill their space with guesses as to how
the players mean to invest their gains
there is a lot of talk abodt the commer-
cialization of the sport some of it is
justified too there isnt any doubt that
a lot of men in baseball from club-
owners down to players think mostly
of the profit there is in the game for
them but if baseball has ceased to be
purely a sport it is certainly still a long
way from having become a matter of
business pure and simple

  and theres a good deal of sentiment
too if charley malone hadnt been
just the sentimental celt he was this
story couldnt he written charley was
manager of the eagles a few years ago
and he was one of the few really great
managers the game has produced the
public has a way of attributing great-
ness to any manager whose team wins
a pennant but baseball-players are

 more chary in their praise they want
 to know what sort of material a man
 had to handle before they grow
 enthusiastic

  many a manager who wears laurels
 in the eyes of the bleachers is almost
 unanimously rated a lucky stiff in the
 dressing-rooms of the big leagues but
 charley malone was not among them
 he had his enemies but friends and
 enemies alike admitted his quality

  alone understood always that
 he had to keep two objects in his
 mind he had to turn out as good a
 team as he could and he had to make
 money for the owners of the eagles
 nearly always of course the fulfill-
 ment of one of these objects takes care
 of the other too but that rule has its
 exceptions championship teams have
 had unprofitable seasons clubs that
 were out of the race by the fourth of
 july have been able to show a big
 balance on the right side of the ledger
 a mechanically perfect team is often

 civil war in a whirlwind infield takes
    the ginger out of a pennant-winning

 teama delightful story of big baseball

by the man who wrote quarter limit
a sour infield



unpopular while there will be some-
thing about a losing team that satisfies
the crowds the athletics playing
baseball so good that it could hardly
have been better never won the heart
of philadelphia the white sox could
never play badly enough even if they
finished last to alienate the affections
of chicago

  the eagles were a good deal more
like the white sox in that respect than
the athletics charley malone won his
fair share to put it mildly of pennants
but even in years when he was rebuild-
ing his team the home crowds remained
loyal malone himself was responsible
for this to a great extent his appear-
ance on the coaching-lines was always
the signal for a round of applause

  i knew malone pretty well because
for several years i traveled with the
eagles a baseball reporter who is
attached to a club gets to be pretty inti-
mate with it as a rule he learns all
sorts of things that never find their way
into print and when the players under-
stand that he will respect their confi-
dence mighty little is hidden from him
i broke in as a baseball reporter with
the eagles and in my first season
malone and some of the other old-
timers saved my job for me half a
dozen times apiece after that i went
south on the training-trip every spring
and made all the road trips with the
club traveling in the clubs private car
and staying at the hotels it favored
i saw the eagles win three pennants
and then in the season that saw charley
malones hope of breaking modem
league records by winning a fourth
consecutive flag shattered i was out of
baseball

  in that year i tried to get away from
newspaper work but the next spring
saw me back on the job and i went
south with the eagles again i dont
mind admitting that there was a lump
in my throat when old sam my par-
ticular hackman grabbed my suit-case
away from a lot of fresh young darkies
at the station and the lump got bigger
when i got my first glimpse of the
marvin house and saw old doc porger
just as fat as ever standing in his
shirt-sleeves in the door looking to see
what guests the train had brought him

harley was on the job of course
and a few of the regular battery
men had come down early but the
hotel was swarming with the rookies
the scouts had sent along for charley
to pass on and the veterans of the team
werent due for a week still there
were enough of the old timers around
to make me feel as if id stumbled into
an old home week celebration and
they acted as if they were just as glad
to see me as i was to be there again
by the time the poker-game broke up
along about midnight i felt as if id
never been away at all and then
charley and i sat up fanning until
it began to get light charley wasnt a
playing manager and so it didnt matter
what sort of hours he kept and it was
a sort of special occasion anyway

  i knew in a general way that the
whole club had fallen down the summer
before and that was why the panthers
had been able to slip in and win a
pennant that charley could have bor-
rowed money on from any man who
knew the league but i didnt know
the details because id been away and
hadnt seen the team in action and i
hadnt been around all winter to hear
the gossip either i supposed it was
just another version of the old story
the sudden collapse of a championship
team

  this has happened often enough
one summer the team will be invincible
and then during the winter something
happens there isnt much warning as
a rule the third basemans arm will
stiffen up a little perhaps so that his
throw will be delayed just long enough
to account for a lot of infield hits that
would have been outs the year before
the lead-off batter will slow up a step
going down to first and be out where
and when he used to be safe the star
base-runner will need a fifth of a second
more between first and second-there
will be half a dozen things that dont
amount to much in themselves but are
enough taken together to account for
fifteen games or so-and a pennant

  but when i suggested that explana-
tion to charley he shook his head
rather sadly

  its worse than that bill he said
im not saying pete megrue had quite


the blue book magazine

as much speed as he used to have but
hes been working  bis slow ball and
hes made up for any speed hes lost by
using his head more and its the same
way with the others after we began
to slump they looked bad part of the
time but theyre not youngsters vou
know and they didnt kill themselves
when they once saw the panthers were
going to cop anyhow they knew the
reason we went bad just as well as i
did flint and murphy got sour on
one another

yy ell that explained everything
 right away if the shortstop and
the second baseman of a team arent
working together playing out the
schedule is just a matter of form
theres about as much chance for the
team to do anything as there would be
for an automobile to run if the carbu-
retor and the transmission had a
quarrel

  for heavens sake-why i asked

  search me said charley they
never were bunkies or anything like
that but they got along all right and
you know how they played around that
bag ive seen as much baseball as any
man alive i guess and ive never seen
a pair like them i remember you
wrote a piece once about how they
seemed to have the same thoughts-
how each of them would always take a
chance on a blind throw if hed been
caught off his balance after a hard stop
and be sure the other would get the
throw and you sized them up right
too they seemed to know what the
other was thinking sort of by instinct
i never taught them the way to play-
they worked it out by themselves

  couldnt they do their scrapping off
the field 

  oh i guess they tried all right
theyre both hard-boiled eggs i dont
mean anything against em but they
both had sense enough and you know
it to remember that they couldnt keep
on playing ball all their lives and
theyve been salting away their money
ever since theyve been with us they
wanted to cut in on the big series sure
enough but shucks-if-youre sour
tv anianyu cant help showing it
 he first time flint made one of these

blind chucks of his and murphy wasnt
there in time to stop it flint bawled
him out so that everyone in the stands
could hear him and it got worse of
course by august flint straightened
up and waited till murph was on the
bag before hed throw-and so did
murph if either of them started a
double play in the last two months i
dont remember it m

  couldnt you shift them around 

  where to i suppose murph could
play the outfield-hes got the better
arm but what for would i break up
a good garden if it hadnt been for
the outfield wed have finished last
instead of second those two birds
had the whole infield up in the air after
a while neither of thems any good
except in his own position i tried to
make em see reason first-i slapped
fines enough on em to make them both
ready to quit but by the lime i saw it
was hopeless it was too late to do any-
thing im not handing bergman any
bouquets but if you give the panthers
a ten-game lead on the first of septem-
ber hell cop a pennant unless his club
gets into a railroad wreck

it sounded pretty bad i knew

	malones plans and i knew hed
counted on both flint and murphy t
be good for two or three more seasons
so that he probably didnt have any
coming star covered up to take the place
of either of them as a rule charley
could figure out a season or two ahead
of time when one of his regulars was
due to fade out and when the proper
moment came hed call in some kid that
had been getting seasoned in a minor
league and hash him so that managers
who didnt have his forethought would
talk about his luck in always drawing
a prize rookie when he needed him
generally speaking there was about as
much luck in charleys discoveries as
there is in the success of a man who has
won in business by working sixteen
hours a day while his rivals loaf

  how about this year i asked
him

  i dont know-yet he said im
going to play a hunch bill-we ought
to come back this season and show the
panthers up-not to speak of the rest
a sour infield



of the league but theres only one
chance for us to do it-and thats for
flint and murph to forget their fool-
ishness and play ball the way they can
if they want to do it

  you cant replace either of them
not this year ive got some young-
sters but it would spoil them to bring
them up too soon and im going to
need them later flint and murphy are
both too old to break in with a new side-
partner around second and theres
another thing youve got to keep this
dark-but therell be a new manager
for the eagles next year

  huh  i said whats this
charley

  straight goods he said ive been
saving my money for quite a while and
ive made some luck turns in real
estate between seasons the boss knew
about it and he made me a proposition
hes going to let me buy a big block of
stock and slip into his place hes got
a whole lot of things to attend to and
the clubs been taking too much of his
time im planning to break scotty in
as manager and spend most of my time
in the office im getting too old for
the road anyhow so-this is going to
be my last season although i suppose
ill butt in a good deal on scotty for a
while and id kind of like to finish
by copping one more pennant

  i know you i said when id got
used to the idea youd like to win
with the old team too wouldnt you 
well i would he admitted was
there ever a team like it ive had
pennant-winning teams before-but
never one like that will you ever
forget the year we came from away
back and caught the reds on the wire 
the year pete megrue was out for six
weeks and we played our big series
with the panthers with half the boys
more fit to be in hospital than in uni-
form ive seen teams and been on
them that knew more baseball perhaps
and could play better-but on none
gamer twouldnt be the same thing
at all to win another flag if my infields
broken up and so-

  im glad im here i told him and
meant it from the bottom of my heart
i take it ill see things

  and i take it youll keep them out

of your paper he said with a grin
be off to bed bill and let an old man
get his sleep

dy the time the regulars had been in
marvin for twenty-four hours i had
heard the story of the trouble between
flint and murphy from every veteran
on the club-except from the two prin-
cipals of course the thing had a lot of
aspects that would have seemed queer
to one who didnt know the eagles as
well as i did no one took sides for
one thing to any noticeable extent
each man had his particular friends of
course but the trouble hadnt spread as
it might well have done on another club
and the eagles considering that flint
and murphy by their inability to get
along together had cost even man on
the team between two and three thou-
sand dollars representing the individ-
ual shares of a worlds series gate
displayed mighty little resentment
they seemed to take the whole business
as a stroke of bad luck

  there were all sorts of stories about
the scrap it seemed to me that no two
accounts of how it had begun tallied
i judged for myself that the first cause
might have been trivial enough-that if
flint and murphy hadnt been under
the strain of a pennant-fight nothing
much would have come of it i liked
them both flint was a new eng-
lander-a bit taciturn and inclined to be
reserved without being at all uppish
he had been graduated into profes-
sional baseball after starring for a small
college team and had been studying law
for some years i think he expected to
spend one more year after he retired
from the game in law-school before
opening an office of his own

  murphy was as irish as his name-a
good-natured grinning chap who had
fought and smashed his way into the
big league after serving an appren-
ticeship on the sand-lots and in the
scrubbiest of minor leagues murph
i believe must have learned to play
baseball about as soon as he could walk
certainly i have never seen a man with
such a passion for the game most
ball-players like baseball well enough
but have a sort of feeling that they
ought to conceal their fondness for it-


the blue book magazine

that they ought to affect an indifference
that as a rule they do not feel but
if murphy ever had that feeling he
couldnt live up to it his enthusiasm
for the game bubbled up in him all the
time he was never so happy as when
he was on the field and he was just as
keen about winning the last game of the
season when everything was settled as
he was on the crucial games with a rival
pennant-contender

  i wondered a good deal in the week
that passed between my talk with
charley malone and the coming of the
regulars what he meant to do to save
his infield i was ready to back him
i knew charley well enough to be
certain that he had some trick up his
sleeve but the more i heard about the
trouble the harder his task seemed
likely to be i plagued him to tell me
what he was going to do but he
wouldnt and scotty who was down
on the club roster as sandy monteith
the veteran catcher who confined his
activity now chiefly to coaching young
pitchers and was to succeed charley as
manager though he didnt know it was
frankly skeptical

  not a chance bill he told me
not a chance charleys just foolish
enough about the old team to try to
straighten things out but he cant do it
say-heres a tip watch this kid
ramsay from bloomington he wasnt
supposed to come up till next year but
charley put in a hurry call for him just
before we started out this spring if
he hasnt got the makings of a real
infielder ill eat my shirt and look at
him in the batting practice course
theyre not feeding many curves but
hes got a way of walking into a ball
thats mighty comforting

  whats he play i asked

  short or second-its all one to
him said scotty if you wire any-
thing to your paper act like youd
thought it out for yourself but i guess
you wont go far wrong if you announce
that ramsays going to take a job away
from either flint or murph i guess
the bossll keep the one that shapes up
best and slip ramsay in in place of the
other one

  it would be a toss-up between them
wouldnt it i said

  it sure would  said scotty i
guess murph is the better fielder but
flint bats about fifteen points better
murph has more speed on the bases
but flints the best waiter weve got
toss-up is right

the more i saw of ramsay and the

	way charley nursed him along the
more likely it seemed to me that scotty
was right after the regulars got lim-
bered up a bit and the practice games
began ramsay alternated between
second and short on the second team
sometimes he switched from one side
of second after four or five innings
sometimes he played one position one
day and the other the next and he
was just as good as scotty had said
he had a beautiful pair of hands and
he went after everything he seemed
to judge ground-balls by instinct on
the marvin diamond which wouldnt
have won any medals in a convention of
ground-keepers no bounce seemed too
erratic for him to judge it was too
early to tell much about his hitting for
that matter you never can tell much
about a recruits batting until the league
pitchers have had a chance at him but
it looked as if he would be able to hit
well enough he didnt give promise
of being a slugger but i judged he
would probably bat about  and
thats enough for a really brilliant
infielder

  i tried to talk to both flint and
murphy about their quarrel flint
shied away from the subject at once
he wasnt really ugly about it but he
made it impossible for me to refer
to the matter again murphy just
laughed

  oh nothing much he said the
old boys touchy im ready to call it
off if lie is say bill-i suppose you
know we two hicks tossed off the flag
last year if id been charley id have
tied the can to the two of us

  maybe hes going to do it-to one of
you-this year instead i suggested
this ramsay kid looks pretty good
murph

  isnt he a bird said murphy at
once with the utmost and most genuine
enthusiasm say-you dont see em
break in like that any too often bill
a sour infield



if things were just right i guess i could
beat him out all right this year-but
next year thatd be different

  theres just as much chance for him
to heat flint as you i said hes no
better at second than he is at short
yeh-thats true enough  but-
well i guess charley would pass me up
if he cant keep us together

  -cant he i asked

  search me said murph i doubt
it though as i say im willing to
bury the old hatchet any time-on the
field anyhow flint and me-well we
never were such extra special pals but
we always got along all right i kinda
like the old boy at that but i guess
he thinks im pretty small potatoes i
dont believe well ever get working
right together again

i was pretty thoughtful after i left

	murphy theres a lot of truth in
the old saying that it takes two to make
a quarrel and it didnt seem to me that
murphy was doing his share now what-
ever had been the case the season
before i made a chance to tell
charley malone what murphy had said
and he just looked wise and wouldnt
say anything at all so i edged up to
flint a day or two later and walked
back to the hotel with him after the
afternoon practice

  you must want to see ramsay break
intr the infield-you and murph i
said cant you get together to hold
your jobs against the kid 

  i wish youd drop that sort of talk
he said rather unpleasantly im doing
the best i can to play short for malone
and the club if charley can get some
one who can work in better with
murphy than i can ive got no com-
plaint to make you know as well as i
do that this young fellow ramsay will
be better than i am next season

  next season isnt this i said

  it might as well be as far as im
concerned said flint im rather
sorry i reported at all this spring i
might as well have gone to work and
saved some time

  well i wasnt sure by any means
but after that i had a sort of hunch
that kept me from being very much
surprised with the way things finally

turned out and it certainly wasnt
any shock to me when a day or two
later charley did something that was
highly unusual-not to say unprece-
dented he called a bunch of us
together one night in the hotel includ-
ing me and one or two of the other old-
timers among the reporters because we
really did belong to the club in a way

  look here boys he said this is
a sort of family party and im going to
use the shorter and uglier words you
all know i was pretty well broken up
when we didnt cop last year after the
start we made even if i didnt say
much and you know im specially
anxious to have this old team win one
more flag before it begins to break up
as its sure to do after this season

  well it was a bit of foolishness that
beat us last year i hoped flint and
murph would cool off during the
winter and come down here showing
some signs of human intelligence but
they havent im not going to curse
them out or try to find out which of
them is right if you ask me i think
theyre both wrong-and i sort of hope
they both choke but its come down
to this one of them can stay-the
others got to go ramsay can fill in
for one of them and it doesnt seem to
make any difference to him which it is
im sorry i hoped i could keep the old
infield together but i cant so im
declaring it an open race between them
from now on im asking them both to
do the best they can and when we start
the season ill choose between them

  flint and you murph-id like to
keep you both maybe im stronger
for one of you than for the other and
maybe im not that wont cut any ice
anyhow its the one that can do most
for the team thats going to stay i
expect you to make it as easy as you
can for me maybe if you know it
wont be for long you can play together
something like the way you used to
and ive told you like this before the
rest of the boys because weve always
talked out in meeting on this dub and
the boys are in this too in a way

ljow that affected the practice

	games must be fairly easy to imag-
ine all of us watched that scrap


the blue book magazine

around second base of course if
another ty cobb had broken into the
outfield hed have had a hard time
getting any attention just at first
murphy and flint both cut loose with
all they had to try to prove which was
the better man that was human
nature they couldnt do anything else
but after the first day or two things
began to develop in a rather curious
fashion i had a good chance to study
the two of them because i umpired a
whole lot of the practice games and
standing around second base as i natu-
rally did a good deal of the time  could
hear a lot i didnt feel that it mattered
an awful lot you know if i booted a
few decisions i was a lot more inter-
ested in those two than i was in
whether a man was out or safe im
afraid i made some pretty raw deci-
sions and i heard a lot of plain truths
about my eyesight

  the first thing that made me hide a
grin was something murphy said about
three days after charleys little sermon
flint had gone away off to his left for
a hard grounder there was a man on
first and murphy streaked over to the
bag to take the throw in the old days
flint would have thrown at once even
if hed fallen and landed on his ear
making the stop but now he waited
to get set and make his throw sure and
they lost the play

  come on-come on said murphy
take a chance-ill get your throw
after a stop like that if its within ten
feet of me i

co the next time there was that sort
of play flint did make a crazy
toss the ball was low and murph
keeping one foot on the hag just did
make the pick-up-completing a singu-
larly brilliant play and a little later
flint returned the compliment that
wouldnt have been remarkable two
years before but it was the first time
they had done anything of the sort since
they had quarreled they hadnt made
up you know they still avoided all but
absolutely necessary speech but it was
easy enough to see what was happen-
ing each of them was so anxious to
give the other a square deal that they
both leaned backward murphy when

he saw that i understood condescended

to explain

   it s this way bill he said i
havent any more use for flint than
ive had for a long time but im not
going to have anyone saying i threw
him down or messed up plays just to
show him up and  guess he feels the
same way hes got while spots

   it was beautiful to see the way they
worked together now it was a revela-
tion of perfect team-work where team-
work is absolutely essential as for
choosing between them i didnt see
how it could be done they were both
so good that it was heartbreaking to
think that it couldnt last and that one
of them would have to go sometimes
that thought made me laugh and some-
times knowing what it would mean to
charley to have them play that way
through the season it made a sort of
lump come in my throat

   as i said i had a hunch that charley
was up to some trick but i couldnt
figure out just what it could lie i could
go just about so far of course any-
one could see this much he had
counted on the love of fair play in each
of them to get them to showing good
team-work again but what use would
that be if they werent reconciled
they wouldnt keep it up i did think
for a while that he meant to string
them along and get them into the regu-
lar season by pretending he couldnt
choose between them but they thought
of that themselves murphy did any-
how and i knew flint well enough to
be sure that hed think of it too

   charleys pretty foxy murphy told
me i guess hes figuring on making
us keep this sort of thing up but it
wont do its too much of a strain
im afraid of slipping up some time
hes got to make his pick and let one
of us out say bill-i used to think
id want to croak when i got through
but i guess im sort of getting used to
the idea i told you about that ranch i
had my eye on didnt t  i got a chance
to gel it cheap if i make a move pretty
quick

t-he time wore on and we started
north on the way home for the
opening stopping off of course to play
a sour infield



exhibition games and still charley kept
saying he couldnt make up his mind
between them and then one day
when we were playing baltimore i saw
murphy grin suddenly as he set him-
self for an easy roller-and the next
moment the ball went right through his
legs and on to the outfield he acted
pretty well-bent down and looked for
a pebble or a worm-cast or something-
the infielders regular alibi when he
makes an error and he kept on acting
you never saw such an exhibition of
fielding as he gave that day hed
made five errors on easy chances when
i lost count-and the reason i lost count
was that i got interested in flint

  he didnt pay much attention to that
first fumble  but when murph
dropped a pop fly in the next inning he
turned around and stared at him and
by the time murphy had done about
all the horrible things a good infielder
dreams of doing after hes been eating
welsh rarebit flint was crazy then
he started in to boot a few himself but
he wasnt as good an actor as murphy
and everyone could see he was doing it
on purpose

  of course the crowd was wild and
i cant blame them those two imbeciles
turned that game into a burlesque but
charley just sat and grinned when he
knew they couldnt see him he looked
like the original cheshire cat i dont
hang around the clubhouse as a rule
after a game but you couldnt have
kept me out of the dressing-room that
day with anything short of an army
corps i trotted across the field right
behind old charley and i was at his
elbow when he opened up on flint and
murphy

  youre a fine pair of misfits he
said i didnt tell you i wanted to get
rid of both of you did i  i said i
wanted to know which was the better
until you began to run wild flint i
thought i could tie the can to murph
on the showing he made to-da
now-

  flint turned on murphy suddenly

  you poor bonehead he shouted
did you think i didnt know what you
were doing trying to show yourself
up so id get the job eh whats the

matter do you think ill starve if i
get my release 

  aw shucks said murphy it
didnt matter to me jim id as soon
hit the trail for my ranch this year as
next

  rot said flint youd rather
play ball than eat you always were
that way it didnt matter to me if
id landed the job it would have both-
ered me to think about you reading the
box-scores when you got your paper a
day late

they stared at each other and sud-

	denly charley grabbed them both
each by a shoulder

  i ought to knock your thick heads
together he said youre sore as
blazes at one another arent you so
sore that youve been lying awake
nights wondering how you could fool
me into keeping the other one the two
of you do you know what youre
going to do youre going to stay and
play the way youve been doing until
to-day-the way you played before you
went bugs

  i couldnt help it i fell down on the
nearest bench and began to laugh and
as soon as i could speak i went at them
too

  you had a fine chance with charley
malone i told them hes had your
number from the start he knew just
about how serious that wonderful
quarrel of yours was what in time
was it about anyhow-now that its all
over and done with

  they looked at one another and
then they began to grin rather shame-
facedly it was murphy who stuck his
hand out first but flint didnt waste
any time in grabbing it and then flint
turned to me

  none of your business he said

  but i didnt mind he was still
grinning as he said it

  thats right said murphy you
said something jim these news-
paper guys are too nosy anyhow
gosh jim-to think you cared about
my losing my job i-

  charley and i started outside to-
gether it seemed to us that we werent
wanted there any more
francis theydon a novelist
stopping outside a new york theater
to wait for a taxi was much struck
by the beauty of a young woman
whose father was just putting her into a
limousine

  theydon overheard the man excusing him-
self to his daughter saying he had an
appointment at the union league club as
the novelist neared the innesmore apart-
ments where he lived however he hap-
pened to sec through the window this same
distinguished-looking gentleman striding
along in his own direction now the innes-
more is in a very different direction from the
union league and theydon-wondered

  theydon wondered still more when poking
his head out a window of number  his
own apartment he saw the deceiving parent
enter the innesmore a moment later a
step sounded on the stair and the visitor
rang and was admitted to number  the
apartment opposite theydons occupied by
an attractive widow named mrs lester

  next day however the novelist discovers
he has come in contact with tragedy rather
than intrigue for on returning from a day
spent at an aviation field he is met at the
station by his valet bates accompanied by
two detectives steingall and clancy and
they inform him that mrs lester the lady in
number  has been found strangled to
death that morning

  contenting themselves with a superficial
questioning the detectives allow theydon to
keep a dinner engagement upon his promise

a complete
resume of
the opening
installments

to meet them later at his apartment so the
novelist goes on to his appointment-and
recognizes in his host james creighton
forbes a millionaire and a fellow aviation-
enthusiast the man whose conduct had so
puzzled him the previous night

  returning to his apartment theydon meets
the detectives and they cross the hall to the
apartment where the murder was committed
as they talkjhe matter over he notes that
the odor of chinese joss-sticks clings about
the room from the detectives he learns
that mrs lester had written a letter at
eleven-thirty the night of her death
addressed to miss beale an aunt in connect-
icut and stating that a friend had just called
and given the writer information that had
influenced her to leave new york at once
theydon also learns that a curious carved
ivory skull was found in the bodice of the
dead woman the detectives leave-but not
until theydon in his desire to protect the
father of the girl he admires has cast sus-
picion on himself by his evasive statements

next day miss beale calls on theydon
he learns from her that mrs lester
had recently returned from a six-years resi-
dence in shanghai where her husband a
lawyer was employed-and where he had
suddenly died presumably of poison and
the added fact that mrs lesters income had
been paid her by the bank of which forbes
is the head again links the two together

  theydon telephones miss forbes  she
tells him her father has gone to the district
attorneys office-and that he has received by
mail a strange anonymous gift-a tiny
carved-ivory skull later forbes himself
comes to see theydon and asks his help to
obtain the key to the dead womans apart-
ment as they stand talking just inside the
door of number  forbes asks if any sign
was left by the murderer to indicate that
the crime was an act of vengeance before
theydon can answer a voice comes through
the half-open door are you thinking of a
small ivory skull mr forbes
chapter vii

mr forbes explains himself

even the boldest may flinch
when confronted with that
which is apparently a mani-
festation of the supernatural
theydon and forbes were standing in
a chamber of death to the best of
their belief they were alone in an other-
wise empty flat and those ominous
words coming from some one unknown
and unseen blanched their faces with
terror but theydon was a healthy
and athletic young american and
forbes was of the rare order which
combines a frame of exceptional phy-
sique with a mind accustomed to think
imperially two such men might be
trusted to display real grit if sur-
rounded by a horde of veritable
spooks

  the door was thrown wide as they
turned at the sound of the words and
theydon recognized in a strange little
figure-wearing a blue serge suit a
straw hat and brown boots-clancy the
man whom he had looked on as some-
what of a crank and visionary during
their talk of the previous night

  you he gasped and the note of
recognition was sharpened by a sudden
sense of dismay almost of alarm be-
cause of the overwhelming knowledge
that now all his scheming had collapsed
while the representatives of the bureau
would regard him as nothing more than
a poor sort of trickster

  but forbes was not in the habit of

yielding to any man no matter what
his status or howsoever awe-inspiring
might be the governmental department
he represented

  who the devil are you at any rate
he cried angrily and what right have
you to spy in this manner listening to
conversation and breaking in with a
cheap stage effect like this 

  clancy remained motionless his feet
set well apart and his hands thrust into
his trousers pockets the trim natty
figure the spruce and summerlike
attire the small wizened face with its
cynically humorous and wide-awake as-
pect-above all a certain jauntiness of
air and cocksure expression-certainly
did suggest a comedian fresh from
the boards his beady eyes sparkled
slightly at the taunt about stage ef-
fect but he seemingly gave heed only
to the millionaires caustic demand for
an explanation

  you tell he said to theydon

  this is mr clancy of the detective
bureau said the latter nervously he
imagined he could detect in clancys
glance a mixture of amusement and
contempt-amusement at the notion
that any amateur should harbor the
belief that the two best men in the
bureau could be so egregiously hood-
winked and contempt of one who so

ihts reserved
the blue book magazine



far forgot himself as even to dare at-
tempt such a tiling in relation to a
police inquiry into a murder

  i dont know and care less who
mr clancy of the detective bureau
may be went on forbes hotly i
resent his intrusion and wish to be re-
lieved of his presence

  why inquired clancy

  i have given my reasons to the dis-
trict attorney that mere statement
must suffice for you

  really  must ask you to be more
explicit

  i visited the district attorneys
office this morning and placed such evi-
dence in his hands that your depart-
ment will be requested to suspend all
further investigation into the death of
mrs lester

  do you mean that the district at-
torney has sanctioned the breaking-off
of this inquiry

  in the conditions

  because if that is what your words
imply mr forbes i may tell you at
once that i dont believe you it is
more than any official dare do and if
you harbor any lingering doubts on the
point go to mr theydons telephone
ring up the attorneys office and tell
the gentleman at the other end of the
wire exactly what i have said of
course you really dont mean anything
of the sort by virtue of some special
and inside knowledge of certain facts
communicated to the district attorney
you may have persuaded him to
promise that provided the ends of jus-
tice are not defeated thereby every pre-
caution will be taken to keep the main
lines of the inquiry secret until the
whole position can be laid before the
law officers of the state the dis-
trict attorney may have gone that far
mr forbes but not one inch further
and you know it

the two antagonists so singularly
disproportionate in size were yet
so perfectly matched in the vastly more
important qualities of brain and nerve
that the contest lost all sense of in-
equality theydon felt himself of no
account in this duel he was like an
urchin watching open-mouthed a com-
bat of gladiators

  forbes not without a perceptible
effort choked down his wrath and

recovered his poise

  you have gauged the state of affairs
accurately enough he said speaking
more calmly may i then recommend
you to consult your direct superiors be-
fore carrying your investigations any
further mr-

  clancy-charles francois clancy
just so mr charles francois
clancy

  i gave you my full name because
one of the peculiar features of this case
is the inability of some persons mixed
up in it to recall names or even the
most salient facts the detectives
glance dwelt for an instant on they-
don who again in his own estimation
shrank into the boots of a small boy
detected by a master in overt breach of
school rules

  but the little man was speaking im-
pressively and theydon compelled his
wandering wits to pay attention

  it will clear the air perhaps went
on clancy if i point out that if any-
one here is playing the spy-carrying
on some underhand game that is-it
is not i these apartments are in
charge of the police the manager of
the whole block of flats and the jani-
tor of this particular section have been
warned that no one can be allowed to
enter number seventeen on any pre-
text until our inquiry is closed now
mr forbes kindly explain how you
contrived to get possession of a key
an experienced man of the world
like forbes could hardly fail to see that
he was in a false position and that any
persistent attempt to browbeat the de-
tective would not only meet with utter
failure but might possibly compromise
him gravely

  that was a simple matter he said
mrs lesters servant left her keyin
mr theydons establishment bates
surprised both his master and me by
producing it when i expressed a wish
to examine the place

  but why adopt such a clandestine
method 

  forbes face usually so classic in
outline assumed a certain rigidity and
his firm chin grew markedly aggress-
ive
number 



  i dont answer questions put in that

wav he said

  clancy laughed sardonically

  you meet with greater respect in
wall street i have no doubt he
snapped there you stand on a pedes-
tal with one hand flourishing a check-
book and the other resting gracefully
on the neck of a golden calf here
you are simply an ordinary citizen be-
having in a suspicious manner if the
atrolman in the next block knew what
know of your recent movements he
would arrest you without ceremony
and charge you with being concerned in
the murder of mrs lester between
you and mr theydon the work of my
department has been hindered most
scandalously dont glare at me like
that i dont care a rap for your mil-
lions and your social position what i
do care about is the horrible risk you
and each member of your family are
incurring you know why and while
you are still alive i mean to force you
to speak tell me now why mrs les-
ter was killed tell me too why the
same hand which thrust a little ivory
skull into the dead womans under-
bodice caused a similar token to be
delivered to you by this mornings mail
ah that touches you does it now
my worthy financier and philanthropist
step down from your pedestal and be-
have like a being of flesh and blood 

irbes positively wilted under that
extraordinary attack his white
face grew wan and his eyes dilated
with surprise and terror the detect-
ives words seemed to have the effect
of a paralytic shock thenceforth he
was under-dog in the fight

  how do you know that i received an
ivory skull this morning he gasped
have you been to my house  did my
daughter tell you

  clancy chuckled

  youre ready to listen eh well
i dont mind telling you that ive not
stirred out of this flat since seen
oclock this morning and i question if
your letters were delivered in madison
avenue at that hour

  i give in said forbes curtly
need we remain here the smell of
that cursed joss-stick oppresses me

  then theydon found his tongue

  if mr clancy cares to abandon his
vigil my flat is entirely at your dis-
posal he said

  my vigil as you accurately de-
scribe it has ended for the time being
said clancy apparendy mollified by the
millionaires surrender i was sure
that if i remained here long enough i
would clear away some of the fog
attached to a case which promises to
be one of the most remarkable i have
ever investigated come gentlemen let
us be amiable to one another im sorry
if i lost my temper just now but i
regard myself as being the only detect-
ive in existence who uses other sec-
tions of his brain than those governed
by statutes made and provided and it
riles me when men of superior intelli-
gence like yourselves treat me as though
my mission in life were to direct the
traffic and keep a sharp eye on mis-
chievous small boysmr they-
don can that soldier-servant of yours
make coffee

  his wife can said theydon

  will you be good enough then to
set her to work thus far this morn-
ing ive had only an apple

  by this time theydon had thoroughly
revised his first estimate of the
diminutive detective indeed they-
don was beginning to look on him as a
very notewrorthy person indeed a man
whose mental equipment it was most
unwise to assess at any lower valuation
than the somewhat exalted one which
clancy himself had set forth with such
refreshing candor

a s for forbes the millionaire seemed
 to have sunk into a species of stu-
por since clancy spoke of the
ivory skull he uttered no word until
the three were seated in theydons
room and his expression was so woe-
begone that it stirred even the mer-
curial sleuth to pity

  i imagine a cup of coffee will do
you also a world of good he said
then whirling round on theydon he
stuck a question into him as if each
word were a stiletto

  where do you get your coffee
at the grocery store was the sur-
prised answer


the blue book magazine

  is that all you know about it

  yes m

  singular thing isnt it mused the
detective aloud how idiotic men and
women can be in their attitude to the
supreme things of life what is of
greater importance than the food we
eat and the liquids we drink through
them the body reconstitutes itself
hourly and daily providence gives us
a perfect engine yet we clog and choke
its shafts and cylinders by supplying it
haphazard with any sort of fuel and
lubricant no matter how unsuited
either may be to its purpose take
coffee for instance the physiological
action of coffee depends on the presence
of the alkaloid caffeine which varies
from six-tenths per cent in the
arabian berry to two per cent in that of
sierra leone again the aromatic oil
caffeone which is developed by roast-
ing increases in quantity the longer
the seeds are kept unfortunately
coffee beans lose weight during storage
so you have a clear commercial reason
why grocers should not sell the best
coffee unless under compulsion of an
enlightened public opinion you mr
fori ies would never dream of putting
your money into an investment without
full and careful inquiry into the history
and scope of the proposed undertaking
while our young friend here would
snort furiously at a split infinitive or
a false rhyme yet when i submit the
vital problem of the sort of coffee you
imbibe-the very essence and nutri-
ment of your brains and bodies-you
hear the kind of answer i receive

  all this of course was excellent
fooling intended tc dispel the brooding
horror which had suddenly descended
upon forbes since it was borne in on
him that the demoniac wrath wreaked
on mrs lester was now- directed with
jual ferocity against his family and
himself

  to an extent clancys scheme suc-
ceeded a gleam of interest shot from
the millionaires eyes they lost their
introspective look he even smiled
wistfully

   you are a man after my own heart
mr clancy he said i had no idea
that the new york detective bureau
employed philosophers of your caliber

i suppose it would be unkind to suggest
that you and i are about to swallow
coffee containing indeterminate per-
centages of the chief constituents you

named

  one does not look at gift coffee in
the cup grinned the little man ob-
viously well pleased with himself but
if ever you two gentlemen favor me
with a visit to my obscure dwelling and
partake of a meal you will have a
strict analysis with every bite and sup
there is a storekeeper in brooklyn
who used to tremble at sight of me
now he has learned wisdom and has
quadrupled his trade by publishing
learned disquisitions on the nature and
quality of each principal article he sells
you ought to read his treatise on but-
ter he is an authority on the dietetic
value of jam the nutritive proper-
ties of his cheese are ruining the local
butchers

lancys efforts were rewarded
when the really excellent beverage
provided by mrs bates was disposed
of forbes seemingly atoned for his
earlier secretiveness by placing every
fact in his possession fully and fairly
before his auditors

  nearly seven years ago he said
i made a very large sum of money by
amalgamating certain shipping interests
at a favorable moment thus as it
happened i had at command practically
unlimited resources when i was asked
to finance the cause of reform in china
the wretched lot of the chinese nation
had always appealed to my sympathies
some hundreds of millions of the most
industrious and peace-loving people in
the world have been exploited for cen-
turies by a predatory caste given a
chance to expand freed from the
shackles of the manchus the chinese
in my opinion contain the elements
which go to form a great race but
the manchus held them in bondage
body and soul and so powerful is self-
interest that there has never been an
emperor or statesman who strove to
elevate the masses who was not merci-
lessly assassinated as soon as he allowed
his intent to become known

 the only path to freedom lay
through revolution and i had reason to
number 



believe that the ruling faction could be
overthrown by a well-organized and
properly financed movement without
the appalling bloodshed which often ac-
companies such dynastic changes at
any rate i entered the conspiracy heart
and soul but i met with two diffi-
culties at the outset i could not exer-
cise efficient financial control from new
york and i could neither go and live
in the far east nor transact my busi-
ness through ordinary banking chan-
nels so i had to find a substitute and
my choice fell on a rising young lawyer
named arthur lester whom i had
known since he was a boy and who
had married the daughter of an old
friend

  lester had a taste for adventure
ard was alive to the magnificent career
which lay before one who helped
materially in the rebirth of china in
a word he went to shanghai as my
agent and the outcome of his work
there is the present chinese constitu-
tion of course as holds good of all
human affairs events did not follow the
precise track mapped out for them but
on the whole he and i were satisfied
china is awake at last the giant has
stirred and if his first uncertain steps
have deviated from the open road of
reform he will never again sink into
the torpor of the past centuries man-
chu arrogance and domination at any
rate are shadows of the past

  but unhappily the conquerors who
have  been so effectually thrust aside
have now embarked on a secret cam-
paign of vengeance and reaction a
society which calls itself the young
manchus is inspired by one principle
and one only and that is death to the
reformers i dont suppose you
gentlemen follow closely the trend of
affairs in china but you must have
read of the assassinations of prominent
men reported occasionally in the news-
papers

lancy clicked his tongue so loudly
that forbes stopped speaking and
looked at him-thinking apparently
that the little detective meant to say
something he did but it was they-
don whom he addressed

  id give a weeks wad if steingall

were here now and i could see those
big eyes of his bulging out of his head
he cackled

  theydon nodded he understood
perfectly then he caught forbes
inquiring glance and explained mat-
ters

  mr clancy hinted last night at
some such development as that which
your present statement conveys and
his colleague mr steingall pretended
to scout it he said

  pretended shrieked clancy in-
stantly in a rage

  that was how it struck me said
theydon coolly

  didnt i drag the chinese aspect of
the crime out of him with a pincers
came the indignant demand

  unquestionably i only remark
that your large-sized friend had it
tucked away all the time at the back
of his head

  clancy pounded the table so viciously
that the cups rattled

  of course he has a nose to smell
joss-sticks and eyes to see an ivory
skull but didnt he say i was talking
nonsense when i spoke about shang
ti scowling from a porcelain vase
he shrilled

  yes for all that i dont think he
missed the least hint of your mean-
ing

  clancy gazed at theydon fixedly

  sorry he said with an acid tone
that was almost malicious i imagined
you were so busy throwing dust in our
eyes that you wouldnt have noticed
such fine shades of perception on
steingalls part

dut theydon was now able to
measure this strange little man with
some degree of accuracy he only
smiled and said

  as a thrower of dust i was a most
abject failure

  clancy sniffed and then turned to
the millionaire

  pardon the interruption he said
like every artist i am pained when
my best efforts are scoffed at by heed-
less mediocrity you at least will
understand what a big thing it was to
deduce even the vaguest outline of the
truth from the facts at my command


the blue book magazine

  i certainly do agreed forbes
until this morning i was convinced
that mrs lesters death removed the
one person in america who knew of my
connection with the revolution in
china to revert to the young man-
chus-they have secured far more vic-
tims than the world at large is aware
of i am sure that they poisoned
arthur lester and his wife held the
same view they aim at nothing less
than the extinction of the democratic
cause by the murder of every prominent
man connected with it

  but they have never yet been able
to obtain a full and authentic list of
the reform leaders they suspected
poor lester of complicity in the move-
ment and killed him it was through
mrs lester that i first became aware
of their existence as an active organiza-
tion and i hoped that when she had
returned to america and was living
quietly in new york she would be lost
sight of-ignored in fact neverthe-
less both she and i thought it prudent
that our acquaintance should cease un-
til the turmoil in china has subsided
for that reason i never visited her
nor did i permit the growth of friend-
ship between her and my wife and
daughter a friendship which in hap-
pier conditions would have been
natural and inevitable

  but we were woefully mistaken
an oriental vendetta neither slackens
nor dies by some means wholly un-
known to me the young manchus must
have discovered or guessed that in
leaving lesters widow out of their
reckoning they had lost a promising
clue be that as it may they followed
her to new york and by a singular
fatality i was the first to know of it

  last monday while driving home
from wall street my car was held up
in madison square for a few seconds
looking idly out at the passing crowd
i saw a chinaman in european clothes
he was waiting to cross the road so
i was able to scrutinize him carefully
and owing to a scar on the left side of
his face i recognized him his name
is worig li fu a manchu of the man-
chus a mandarin of almost imperial
lineage some years ago he was a
young attache at the chinese embassy

in washington suddenly while on the
way to my house i recollected that cer-
tain members of the revolutionary
committee had spoken of this very man
as being one of the ablest and most un-
scrupulous adherents of the manchu
faction in pekin somehow his
presence in new york was disconcert-
ing and menacing who more likely
than he i argued to be a leading spirit
among the young manchus

  in any event new york was not
big enough to hold both mrs lester
and him and i decided to visit her that
very night tell her i had seen wong
li fu and advise her to go away into
the country leaving no record of her
whereabouts i happened to be taking
my daughter to dalys theater and
contrived to slip away on some pre-
text after the performance i found
mrs lester alone in her flat and she
fell in with my views at once because
she too had heard of this very man and
the mere sound of his name terrified
her i was half inclined to urge that
she should go to a hotel for the night
but the lateness of the hour and the
seeming fact that if danger threatened
she was safe at least till the morrow
prevented me ah me i obeyed the
one intuition why was i deaf to its
logical successor

lancy sitting on the edge of a
chair his head bent forward his
piercing black eyes intent as those of a
hawk a hand resting on each knee his
attitude curiously suggestive of a readi-
ness to spring forward at any instant
now leaned over and tapped the mil-
lionaire decisively on the shoulder

  you couldnt have saved her mr
forbes he said she was marked
down as the first warning didnt the
letter you received this morning tell you
something of the sort

  agitation gave place to utter aston-
ishment in forbes face

  in heavens name how do you
know anything of any letter he
cried

  ill tell you later but am i not
right 

  yes you are

  where is it may i see it
  forbes took a creased and folded
number 



document from a small flat cardboard
box which he carried in the breast
pocket of his coat but first he with-
drew from the box a little round ob-
ject and placed it on the table it
was an ivory skull and the very pres-
ence of such a sinister token brought
some hint of the charnel-house into a
cosy and sunlit room

  clancy a creature oddly constituted
either of all nerves or of no nerves dis-
regarded the skull he had eyes only
for the few words typed on a single
sheet of note-paper they ran

  james creighton forbes

    if you are willing to come to terms
  announce the fact by advertisement in
  thursdays times address your reply
  to y m and sign it j c f yield
  and you will hear further refuse and
  no other warning will be given

chapter viii

the first counter-stroke

clancy apparently made up his
mind with reference to the con-
tents of the somewhat enigmatic
message after one quick unerring
perusal

 the man who wrote that took a
great many things for granted he said
he assumed first that you knew of
mrs lesters death and understood its
significance secondly that you are
aware of the nature of the terms he
will offer thirdly that you may hesi-
tate between compliance and threatened
death y m of course can be read
as young manchus even there
the writer exhibits artistic reticence

frankly mr forbes i wish

you had come straight to the bureau
on monday evening instead of wast-
ing those precious hours at dalys
theater

  forbes was moved to energetic pro-
test

 how was i to deduce the true
nature of these hell-hounds mission
from a casual glance at one who may
or may not be their leader he cried

  yet you treated your discovery as
serious enough to warrant a prompt
visit to the woman with whom associa-
tion was dangerous

  yes i wanted to act secretly

  just so you were afraid the police
would bungle the job between you
and mr theydon you have exhibited
remarkable skill in heading us off the
scent fortunately we were able to
dispense with your assistance having
other matters to occupy our brains
you two were ripe nuts waiting to be
cracked and have the contents extracted
at leisure there were a few freshly
broken shells lying about which invited
immediate attention for instance
some four months ago a well-known
and reputable firm of pri vat e-inquiry
agents was instructed from canton to
secure all possible information about
mrs lester and you-yes you
mr forbes-your household friends
methods of living servants trades-
men-every sort of fact indeed which
might be useful to a thoroughgoing
and well-organized society of cut-
throats like the young manchus

  the inquiry-agents did their work
well and were handsomely paid for it
i havent the least doubt that wong li
fu knows what brand of cigars you
favor and what cereal you eat for
breakfast his informants sent us a
copy of their notes an hour after the
murder was announced in the news-
papers and kindly note the sequence
of dates mr lester is removed in
shanghai his widow comes home
the inquiry-agents receive instructions
they forward their report to canton
and wong li fu turns up in new
york the program is a tribute to the
excellence of the mail service between
america and the far east

yyhile the detective was speaking
vv forbes face already haggard
had grown desperate

  i care little for my own life he
said but i shall stop short of no
measures to protect my wife and
daughter

  i certainly recommend that an
armed guard be on duty day and night
in any house where you may happen to
be living at the moment replied clancy
airily i really think that if your
safety alone were at stake i would
do you a good turn by arresting you on
suspicion


the blue boor magazine

  on suspicion of what crime

  of killing mrs lester to be
stire

  i regard you as a clever man mr
clancy so may  remind you that this is
neither the time nor the place for a
display of gross humor

  theydon expected that clancy would
flare into anger at this well-deserved
rebuke but much to the novelists sur-
prise the detective treated the matter
argumentatively

  personally i have looked on you
from the outset as an innocent man
he said placidy but just to show how
circumstantial evidence may be twisted
into plausible error let me point out
that nearly all the known facts con-
spire against you have you consid-
ered how dexterously a prosecuting
counsel would treat your admission
that mrs lester was the one person in
america who knew of your connection
with the revolutionary party in china
and how would you set about convinc-
ing an average new york jury that you
were acting in the interests of law and
order in concealing your visit to num-
ber seventeen on the night of the mur-
der these fine-drawn speculations
however are a sheer waste of breath
suppose we concoct an advertisement
for the times

  do you mean that i am to parley
with these ruffians

  of course you are

  but the district attorney agreed
with me that no action should be taken
until the chinese legation had con-
sidered the matter

  and pray what can the legation
do

  they have their own sources of
information when all is said and
done orientals are best fitted to deal
with orientals

plancy laughed sarcastically

      if i remember rightly the way
in which the chinese embassy in lon-
don dealt with one of your pet reform-
ers some years ago did not win general

approvalno mr forbes we

     try and circumvent the wily
chinee by other methods than torture
and imprisonment of what avail will
it be if this fellow wong li fu is

laid by the heels isnt it more than
ccrtain that he has plenty of determined
helpers do you imagine he killed mrs
lester not a bit of it he will be
able to produce the clearest proof he
was miles away from the innesmore on

monday nightnow lets see

how we can get him to show his hand
a little more openly how would this
be y m terms can be arranged
-j c f the terms are of course
that the whole gang be electrocuted or
sent to sing sing

  one moment struck in theydon
 have something to say before you
decide on any definite action i need
hardly inflict on you mr clancy an
explanation of my silence hitherto i
dont even apologize for it faced by
a similar dilemma to-morrow i should
probably take the same line but to
adopt your own simile now that mr
forbes has come out of his shell and
admits his presence here on monday
night my self-imposed restrictions
cease in the first place then miss
beale came here this morning-

  excellent i wondered who the lady
was put in clancy

  and secondly the gray car which
pursued me on monday seems to have
been partly identified later a car
resembling it in every detail deposited
some one at the residence of some
chinese envoy in fifty-ninth street at
an hour which corresponds closely
with its presence here

  ah that is important i like that
i wasnt far wrong when i sensed you
as an absolute carrier of clue-germs in
this affair cried clancy

 the chinese envoy gasped
forbes what car and why should
any car pursue you  do you mean that
you were followed on leaving my
house 

  it was lamentable to watch the in-
road which each successive shock was
making on forbes physical resources
but theydon affected to ignore the new
fright in his eyes and told him
what had happened although he could
see that clancy was in a fever of im-
patience to learn the later news he
thought that forbes should know the
facts in view of the remarkable state-
ment that he himself had visited the
number 



chinese envoy that morning in one
respect the recital was a test of the
millionaires professed readiness to deal
candidly with the police theydon was
half inclined to believe that the other
was still wishful to conceal that part
of the days doings but he was mis-
taken when he had finished his own
story and given the taxi-mans version
of the gray cars appearance in fifty-
ninth street forbes threw out his
hands in a gesture of despair

   if the plenipotentiary is playing me
false i do not know whom to trust
he said brokenly i have just come
from him and he assures me that if
wong li fu and his gang are in new
york he is absolutely ignorant of the
fact

  pooh cried clancy snapping a
thumb and forefinger dont worry
about that put yourself in the posi-
tion of the chinese envoy he cant
even guess who may be the ruler of
china from one day to another yes-
terday it was an old woman to-day its
a dictator to-morrow it may be the
mob who can foretell what shape the
lava spouted from a volcano will take
bet you a new hat mr forbes that
the minute the envoy heard of mrs
lesters murder he put two and two
together and kept a sharp eye on these
mansions and on your house that
gray car is nothing more nor less than
a red herring accidently drawn across
the trail the murdered woman is the
wife of forbes agent in shanghai
now lets see what forbes is doing
and who visits him and perhaps well
learn something is it a bet

ttorbes could not help but recover

  some of his shattered nerve in view
of the detectives airy optimism still
he was shaken and dubious

  dont forget that the chinese plen-
ipotentiary has no knowledge whatso-
ever of my share in the revolution he
said he is here to arrange a big
international loan

  and dont forget that for ways
which are dark and tricks which are
vain the heathen chinee is peculiar
retorted clancy how can you be
sure that there is not in the envoys
house at this moment a full statement

of your payments to the reformers
funds as well as the list of conspirators
which our friend wong li fu is in
search of

   i think that such a thing is almost
impossible

   is there anything really impossible
we used to believe that once a man
was dead he could not be brought to
life again a frenchman has just
demonstrated that by a judicious appli-
cation of galvanism to the heart and
salt-water to the veins any average
corpse can be revived

  evidently clancy was enjoying him-
self he sat there absorbing new im-
pressions and irradiating scraps of
irrelevant knowledge in a way that
would have been full of significance to
steingall had he been present clancy
was never so mercurial never so ready
to jump from one subject to another as
when his subtle brain was working at
high pressure he actually reveled in
a crime which lay on the borderland of
the exotic and the grotesque like the
french philosopher in poes tales of
mystery and imagination the savant
who read his newspaper in a dingy
paris room and solved by sheer force
of intellect extraordinary criminal
problems which baffled the shrewdest
official minds clancy felt in relation to
this particular tragedy that he required
only to be brought in touch with cer-
tain contingent forces bound up with
it-forbes for instance and in a
minor degree theydon-and in due
course he would be able to go forth
and find the master wrong-doer

cuddenly the millionaire seemed
to cast off the cloak of despair
which clogged his energies and impaired
his brilliant intellect he rose to his
feet and involuntarily squared his
shoulders

  surely we are wasting valuable
hours which should be given to action
he cried i am going downtown and
shall arrange for a prolonged absence
from my office then ill hurry home
perfect my defenses and defy these
murderous curs my wife must come
to new york in a crisis like this i
must have my loved ones under my own
personal supervision i can still shoot


the blue book magazine

straight and quick and woe betide any
man white or yellow who enters my
house unbidden as for this infernal
symbol-

  he raised a clenched fist and would
have pounded into fragments the thin
fabric of the ivory skull still lying
where he had placed it on the table
had not clancy snatched it into safety

  no no protested the detective
i want that for purposes of compari-
son kindly give me that typed note
too mr forbes it may bear finger-
marks you never can tell the card-
board box in which it was posted also
thank you now a few more ques-
tions before you go how much money
did you provide for the revolution-
aries

  ten million dollars

  as a gift or a loan

  if they failed i lost every farthing
of course if they succeeded i was
to recoup myself by financing the new
government

  but i gather that they have neither
failed nor succeeded china has a con-
stitution but the presidential election
was conducted on lines suspiciously
akin to those recently adopted in
mexico

  nevertheless negotiations are now
on foot for a loan

  if you died what would become of
the ten millions

  they would be lost irretrievably
  clancy sat back in his chair

  that gives one furiously to think
he said the gray car comes back
into the picture

  what do you mean

  i dont know but ill tell you
what the man who first spoke of a
chinese puzzle as a metaphor for some-
thing downright bewildering knew what
he was talking about

  forbes put a hand to his forehead
in an unconscious gesture of hopeless-
ness

  my brain is reeling he muttered
good god to think that in the
new york of to-day we should live in
abject terror of a band of mongolian
ruffians why do you remain here
man you vaunt the prowess of your
department-why are you not scour-
ing every haunt of chinamen in the

bowery spread your net widely
enough and you will surely get hold of
some minor scoundrel who will talk
for fear or money bribe him to the
point where he cannot refuse to speak
wong li fu is the only man i fear
put him where he can accomplish no
mischief and the rest of his crew will
be powerless

  when you come to count up the
achievements of my friend steingall
and myself-in the face of stupid but
none the less disheartening obstacles
-we have not done so badly in two
days said clancy complacently

  can i drive you anywhere my car
is waiting

  no thanks the truth is mr
forbes i look on you as a disturbing
influence a man who can talk as
calmly as you about dropping ten mil-
lions on a crazy project to introduce
western methods into china is not
fitted for the phlegmatic and judicial
atmosphere of the bureau if i want
any money ill come to you if not
and all goes well in madison avenue
the next time ill trouble you will be
when you are asked to identify wong
li fu dead or alive

  forbes seemed hardly to be aware
of clancys words he went out
theydon accompanied him and as they
descended the stairs together the older
man said brokenly

  it is my wife and daughter for
whom i fear i can hardly control my
senses when i think of these yellow
fiends contemplating vengeance on me
through them theydon-do you be-
lieve in that detective he is
either a vain fool or a genius by
the way i forgot to ask him how he
found out that i had received the warn-
ing delivered by this mornings mail

  ill try and worm an explanation
out of him if he tells me ill phone
you later he is an extraordinary
creature but abnormally clever at his
work i am sure for my own part i
feel disposed to trust him implicitly i
wish you had met his colleague chief
inspector steingall he is the sort of
man whose mere presence inspires con-
fidence

  forbes halted on the steps of the
automobile and glanced at his watch
number 



   i shall be home in an hour he said
after that i shall not stir out all day
telephone me if you have any news
why not dine with us to-night

  theydons eyes sparkled he was
longing to meet evelyn forbes once
more but a wretched doubt diminished
the glow of gratification which the
prospect brought should he or should
he not tell the girls father of the rather
indiscreet admissions she had made
during their brief talk that morning

that minor worry however was
a banished suddenily and forever
clancy taking the three steps which led
from entrance hall to pavement with a
flying leap cannoned right into forbes
whom he grabbed with both hands
quite as much by way of emphasis as to
check the impetus of his diminutive
body

  in with you he piped tell your
chauffeur to obey my orders no matter
what they are

  action determination were as the
breath of the millionaires nostrils he
aroused himself instantly

  you hear downs he said to the
chauffeur

  downs was one of those strange
beings who have been evolved by the
age of gasoline an automaton com-
pounded seemingly of steel springs
and leather he had long ago lost the
art of speech having cultivated delicacy
of hearing and quickness of sight at
the expense of all other human facul-
ties the old-time coachman possessed
a certain fluent jargon which enabled
him to chide or encourage his horses
and exchange suitable comments with
the drivers of brewers wagons and
market-carts but the modem chauffeur
is all an ear for the rhythm of machin-
ery all an eye for the nice calculation
of the hazards of the road fifty yards
ahead

  at any rate downs mumbled some-
thing which resembled yes sir
forbes sprang in and slammed the
door clancy raced round the front of
the car and perched himself beside
downs and the heavy automobile was
almost into its normal stride before it
had traveled twice its own length

  theydon was left gaping on the pave-

ment he saw that the car turned up-
town and caught a glimpse of clancys
outstretched hand with forefinger
pointing like the barrel of a pistol

  fool he cried in bitter self-apos-
trophe why didnt i jump in after
forbes now i am out of the hunt
i wonder what the deuce clancy saw
or heard

  that concluding thought sent him
back to the flat two steps at a time

  bates he shouted has mr clan-
cy used the telephone or did anyone
ring

  no sir said bates coming hur-
riedly at that urgent call fust thing
i knew was he was tearin out an
runnin downstairs like mad

  oh double-distilled idiot that i
am growled theydon again wtiy
didnt i go with them

as though the gods heard his plaint
and meant to crush him with their
answer the telephone-bell sounded at
his elbow mechanically he lifted the
receiver off its hook and immediately
became aware of tomlinsons voice
with some element of flurry and dis-
tress in its unctuous accents

  that you mr theydon said the
butler

  yes

  any news of mr forbes sir
  yes he has just left me

  ah if only i had known and had
given you a call before ringing wall
street

  what is it can i do anything
  its miss evelyn sir

  yes what of her

  shes gone sir

  theydons heart apparently stopped
for a second and then raced madly into
tumultuous action again

  gone good lord man what do
you mean he almost groaned

  a telegram came from mrs forbes
at oyster bay saying she was ill and
wanted miss evelyn i tried all i knew
to persuade miss evelyn to wait until
she had spoken to her father but she
wouldnt listen-she just threw on a
hat and a wrap and took a taxi to the
long island depot

  some membrane or film of tissue
which might have served hitherto to


the blue boor magazine

shut off from frank theydons cheery
temperament any real knowledge of the
pitfalls which may beset the path of
the unwary seemed in that instant to
shrivel as though it had been devoured
by flame me knew how or why he
could never tell that the girl had been
drawn into the hellish plot which had
already claimed so many victims and
sought so many more all doubt
vanished he spoke and acted with the
swift certainty of a man tackling an
emergency for which he had prepared
during a long period of training and
expectation

  mr forbes may arrive at any
moment tomlinson he said tell his
office people to let you know if he goes
first to wall street when you hear
from or see him say that i have either
accompanied or followed miss evelyn
to oyster bay if i do not catch the
same train i shall take prompt meas-
ures in other respects got that

  yes sir

it was easy to distinguish the relief

	in tomlinsons utterance relief
mingled doubtless with astonishment
that a comparative stranger should dis-
play such an authoritative and prompt
interest in the familys affairs

  that is all write down my mes-
sage lest you forget any part of it

  theydon rang off

  come he said to bates who had
not retired to his den but was listen-
ing discreet yet rabbit-eared to these
queer proceedings followed by the
manservant he darted into the sitting-
room and did several things at once
he unlocked a drawer and took from it
a considerable sum of money which he
kept there for emergency journeys also
pocketing an automatic pistol pounc-
ing on a long island railway
folder he looked up the trains to
oyster bay a fast train left new
york at one-twenty-five p m it was
now five minutes past one

  meanwhile theydon was talking

   bates he said i promised miss
beale the lady who came here this
morning that my sister mrs paxton
would visit her this evening say about
six miss beale is staying at central
hotel madison square go to mrs

paxton and see her waiting at her
house if she happens to be out tell
her everything you know about mrs
lesters death and ask her to take care
of miss beale this evening she will
understand ill wire her at the cen-
tral before the dinner hour if possible
if anybody calls here i leave it to your
discretion and your wifes whether or
not they should be informed of my
movements mr forbes or the police
of course must be told everything
miss forbes is probably in the one-
twenty-five train for oyster bay and
i am going with her do you under-
stand 

  yes sir

  ill wire or phone you later
grabbing a straw hat and a bundle
of telegraph-forms theydon vanished
not even waiting to slam the outer
door bates who had seen service
knew that men in times of stress and
danger acted just like the detective and
his own employer

  by jing he muttered beginning
to assemble the empty coffee-cups on a
tray things is wakin up here an
no mistake

theydon was fortunate in finding

	a taxicab depositing a fare at a
neighboring block just before he
reached the vehicle a gentleman hur-
ried out of the building and fore-
stalled him theydon dashed up and
caught the other man by the arm

  my need is urgent he said let
me have this cab

  the stranger smiled good-humoredly
he was an englishman and had not the
least objection to being hustled by an
american indeed being new to the
country he appreciated this exhibition
oi haste as a novel experience

  im rather on a hair-trigger my-
self he said pleasantly i want to
reach the station for long island can
i give you a lift

  in with you cried theydon
now push her he cried to the
driver three dollars if you get us
to coney island depot inside of fifteen
minutes ill pay all fines

  then they were off and the trans-
atlantic cousins were banged against
each other in the sudden start
number 



  oh i say cried the briton this
reminds me of home ive been here a
week and i had a suspicion that the
american live wire was a bluff but
youre awake all right bet you a quid
youre after a girl

  i pay said theydon his eyes
glistening and such a girl

  dear dear is it like that go
right ahead augustus never mind
me take this old bus all the way to
chicago ill find the fares and hold
your hat but kindly shift that gun
into the opposite pocket youve dug it
into my thigh quite often enough if
you want first drop on the other fellow
shove it up your sleeve

chapter ix

sharp work

the englishmans easy-going
badinage provided the best sort
of tonic theydon laughed as
he transferred the pistol from one
pocket to the other

  my motto is defense not de-
fiance  he said i hope sincerely that
i shall not be called on to shoot or
even threaten anyone using fire-
arms although for self-protection is
a tough proposition in new york no
matter what you have bfcn told to the
contrary may i ask your name
mines theydon i live in those flats
we have just quitted

 and im george handyside
middlecombe-cum-ugglebarnby nor-
ton-in-cleveland when im at home
which is seldom

  when youre away do you ever re-
member where you live

  its an effort but long practice has
made perfect

  well mr handyside if ever i
come to england ill hire a guide and
give you a call

  tell you what mr theydon im
very glad to make your acquaintance
this great big country of yours is all
right but i do wish your people
wouldnt assume that no englishman
can see a joke great scott life isnt
worth living unless one has a real laugh
occasionally

tell me where i can find you in

new york later in the week and well
see if we cant find a smile some-
where

  the englishman scribbled the name
of a hotel on a card which theydon
disposed in his pocketbook at the same
time producing one of his own cards

  youll hear from me he said
now mr handyside pardon me dur-
ing the next few minutes i have to
write telegrams

  the first was to forbes addressed in
duplicate to wall street and madison
avenue it ran

    if this message is not qualified by
  another within a quarter of an hour i
  am in the  for oyster bay

  then to steingall

    young lady summoned to oyster bay
  by telegram stating that her mother is
  ill suspect the message as bogus and
  emanating from y m see clancy
  he will explain am hoping to travel
  by same train if disappointed will wire
  again immediately	theydon

  he read each slip carefully to make
sure that the phraseology was clear
the speed at which the cab was travel-
ing rendered his handwriting somewhat
illegible but he thought he saw a means
of circumventing that difficulty

  which way are you going he in-
quired of his unexpected companion
manhattan beach

  what time does your train leave 
  about one-thirty

  you have five more minutes at your
disposal than i have will you hand
in these three messages at the tele-
graph office ill read them to you in
case the counter clerk is doubtful about
any of the words

  certainly mr theydon youve
interested me i dont care a hang if
i drop out manhattan beach al-
together

  im greatly obliged but that is not
necessary youll have heaps of time
were across fourth avenue already
and our driver has a clear run to the
east side now listen 

  mr handyside did listen and
pricked his ears at the mention of the
detective bureau

  by jove he exclaimed this is
so 

the blue book magazine

better than a life-line cinema for the
love of mike let me in by the early
door now how does this notion hit
you you send those telegrams an
ill pay the cab and buy the tickets to
oyster bay for the pair of us i have
no pistol but i may be useful and ill
jab any fellow in the solar plexus at
call

theydon gazed at this self-avowed
 knight-errant in surprise handy-
side was a man of forty whose dark
hair was flecked with gray he was
quietly dressed a wide-brimmed flat-
crowned hat of finely plaited white
straw providing the sole note of
markedly british origin in his attire
the expression of his well-molded
features was shrewd but pleasing and
the poise of a spare but sinewy frame
gave evidence of active habit and
some considerable degree of physical
strength

   ton my honor said the ameri-
can im half inclined to take you at
your word except in the matter of ex-
penses-which of course i must bear
you see if my services are called
for and prove effective i may need
help

  just do as yoirlike said the other
calmly tell me as much or as little
as you like wheres this place oys-
ter bay

  on long island

  i thought it would be everything
of consequence in the neighborhood of
new york seems to be on long is-
land even the atlantic breeze stops
short there at this time of the year

  theydon grinned but the taxi was
crossing second avenue and the hour
was one-seventeen p m

  i cant give you any sort of an ex-
planation now mr handyside he
said later in the week perhaps i
may have a big story for your private
 can say at the moment is
ihis i have reason to believe that a
voung lady a daughter of mr lames
creighton forbes a well-known citi-
zen of new york is being decoyed to
oyster bay in the belief that her
mother is ill now i may be wholly
mistaken her mother way be ill if
that is so i am making this trip under

a delusion at any rate my notion is
to try and fall in with miss forbes acci-
dentally as it were and watch over
her until i am quite sure that she is
with her mother you follow me
seems to me said the english-
man imperturbably its the most
natural thing in the world that mr
theydon should want to show his
friend mr handyside of england
long islands most bracing and attract-
ive seaside resort if thats the right
way to describe oyster bay

  both the plan and the description
are admirable

  the plan sounds all right as for
the description ive been looking up
a selection of posters and those seven
words apply to every half-mile strip of
bcach along the coast when it comes
to a real showdown your poster artists
have got our real-estate men skinned a
mile you see im learning the
american language how much did
you promise the taxi-inan

  three dollars

  half a quid by jove if ever i
want a job ill start cabbing in new
york and the railway tickets-first

class of course

  there is none other

the cab stopped theydon sprang

	out and raced to the telegraph
office where as he anticipated there
was a slight delay handyside awaited
him at the correct barrier and together
they hurried through the train they-
don eagerly on the qui vive for evelyn
forbes thus not being a detective
but only a very anxious and perplexed
young man he had eyes only for such
indies as were already seated and failed
to note the immediate interest his
appearance aroused in a man apparently
buried in a newspaper but watching
unobtrusively everyone who passed
oddly enough after the first wonder-
ing glance this observer was more
closely taken up with handyside it
was as though he said to himself 
theydon i know but who in the
world is his companion and why are
they traveling by an oyster bay ex-
press to-day of all days 

  the train was well filled and there
were only a few seconds to spare when
number 



theydon came across evelyn forbes
in a section otherwise unoccupied

  recognition was mutual and they-
don flattered himself that he betrayed
just the right amount of pleasurable
astonishment

  miss forbes he cried raising his
hat well of all the unexpected meet-
ings dont say you are going to
oyster bay

  but i am she said and though she
smiled her eyes were heavy with un-
shed tears she was deeply attached to
her mother and the thought that the
loved one was too ill even to communi-
cate with her by telephone was dis-
tressing beyond measure

  well just imagine that went on
theydon determined to rush his fences
and travel with her unless openly for-
bidden im taking an english friend
there for the afternoon may we sit
here

  now although evelyn forbes had
been attracted to theydon during their
vivacious conversation overnight she
would vastly have preferred the com-
parative solitude of a journey with
strangers still she could hardly re-
fuse such a request and common sense
told her that a pleasant chat with a man
who could talk so well as theydon
offered a better means of whiling away
an hour than brooding over the nature
and extent of her mothers unknown
illness

  i shall be delighted she said

without further ado theydon
 introduced his companion who
promptly said the right thing

  i seem to have known what i was
doing when i forced mr theydon to
take me out of new york to-day he
said with a smile which left the girl
in no doubt as to the nature of the
implied compliment

  but it is hardly an hour since i
spoke to my father at mr theydons
flat she said were you there too
mr handyside

  no in the next block that was
the nearest i got to mr theydon before
we met and took a cab to the long
island station-sorry i mean depot

  theydon was pleased with his ally
no diplomat trained during long years

to conceal material facts could have
headed the girl off the track more
deftly while every word was literally
true

  ah she said glancing meaningly
at theydon we are all the sports of
fortune then how strange of
course mr theydon you dont know
why i am here i have had a telegram
from my mother or one sent in her
name she has been taken ill sud-
denly

  that is bad news was the sympa-
thetic answer if the message has not
come direct from mrs forbes may it
not be rather exaggerated in tone
some people can never write telegrams
the knowledge that ten words cost
twenty-five cents weighs on them like
a nightmare

  as he hoped and anticipated she pro-
duced the message itself from her
hand-bag

  this is what it says she said and
read mrs forbes ill and unable
communicate by telephone come at
once manager minnehaha hotel 
then she added with a suspicious break
in her voice that sounds serious
enough in all conscience

  is it addressed to you personally
said theydon racking his wits for some
means of lessening the girls foreboding
without tickling the ears of the other
passengers who might be listening by
suggesting that she could have been
brought from her home by some cruel
ruse of her fathers enemies

  yes

  but isnt that somewhat singular in
itself one would imagine that such a
significant message would have been
sent to your father

 why

  well men are better fitted to with-
stand these shocks for one thing it
was heartless or to say the least
thoughtless to give you such news with
the brutal frankness of a telegram

  i cannot understand it at all
mother wrote this morning telling me
that she was going to eaton point this
afternoon with a picnic party

  i am convinced said theydon
gravely that some one has blundered
it may be the act of some stupid for-
eigner i shall not be content now


the blue book magazine

miss forbes until i have gone with you
to the minnehaha and learned what
the extent of the trouble really is

then if mrs forbes needs your pres-
ence perhaps you will allow me to tele-
phone to your father as he will be
greatly disturbed when he returns home
and learns the cause of your journey

  but i cant think of allowing you
two to break up your afternoon on my
account im sure when we reach
oyster bay i shall see an array of golf-
dubs among your luggage

  no smiled theydon my friend
here refuses to play until he has seen
something of the country he knows
that the golfers vision is bounded by
the nearest bunker

  handyside took the cue

  thats the exact position miss
forbes he said i was warned by
the horrible experience of a friend of
mine he left newark new jersey
bound for a sight-seeing tour in eu-
rope but unfortunately took his clubs
with him now if you ask him what
he thought of westminster abbey or
the wye valley he tells you he hadnt
time to look em up but that the fifth
hole at sandwich is a corker while
the thirteenth at st andrews had been
known to restore the faculty of speech
to a dumb man you see some poor
mute had either to express his feelings
or bust

  evidently miss evelyn forbes would
not be allowed to mope during the run
to oyster bay

as between theydon and herself the
 situation was curiously mixed on
the one hand theydon had now a re-
markably close insight into the peril
which threatened forbes and each
member of his family the girl on the
other knew well that her father was
bound up in some way with the tragedy
at number seventeen the innesmore
nevertheless an open discussion was
out of the question and the two
accepted cheerfully the limitations im-
posed by circumstances so the other
passengers in the car little suspected
what grave issues lay behind an appar-
ently casual meeting between a pretty
girl and two men that summers after-
noon in the oyster bay express

  the englishman played his part ad-
mirably when not passing some caus-
tically humorous comment on american
ways and manners he was being even
more critical of his fellow countrymen

  thus the journey passed pleasantly
enough when they alighted on the
crowded platform at oyster bay the
girl reverted to the topic uppermost in
her mind

  you two will have to look after your
baggage she said im sure you will
forgive me if i hurry to the hotel if
you come there mr theydon ill take
care that i see you at once it is
exceedingly kind of you to bother your-
self with my affairs

  but theydon had a scheme ready
having foreseen this very difficulty

  mr handyside will attend to every-
thing he said glibly please let me
come with you i shant have a mo-
ments peace until assured that mrs
forbes is suffering from little more
than a slight indisposition

  evelyn looked puzzled but was will-
ing to agree to anything so long as she
reached her mother quickly handy-
side too made matters easy by lifting
his hat and walking off in the direction
cf the baggage-car

  well she said i really dont care
what happens if only i lose no time

cuiting the action to the word she
hurried toward the exit and was
murmuring something that sounded like
an apology for her seeming brusque-
ness as they passed out a gentleman
approached and raised his hat

  miss forbes i believe he said
yes she answered breathlessly be-
cause the mans garb suggested before
he uttered another syllable that he was
a doctor he had a curiously foreign
aspect and spoke with a pronounced
lisp

  i am assistant to doctor sinnett
he said and he has sent me to take
you to the hotel this is his car will
you come quick

  he pointed to a smart limousine
drawn up near the exit and in his
eagerness to be polite almost pushed
the girl toward the open door insen-
sibly she resisted and turned to ex-
plain matters to theydon
number 



  mr theydon- she began

   there ith no time to wathe i athure
you said dr sinnetts assistant im-
peratively theydons temper was
ruffled he resented the mans man-
ner and did not scrutinize his appear-
ance as closely as might be looked for
in one who was actually on his guard
against foul play

   what is it now he asked

  this gentleman has been sent by
dr sinnett to bring me to the hotel
jaid evelyn now mr theydon per-
haps it will be better if you wait for
mr handyside and come on at your
leisure

  im a stiff-necked person said
theydon trying to smile unconcern-
edly ive made up my mind to see
you safely to your destination and i
refuse to leave you on any account
im sure the doctor will let me sit be-
side the chauffeur

   then for the first time he glanced
directly at the interloper and was al-
most stupefied to discover that the man
despite his faultless professional attire
was a chinaman moreover this
chinaman bore a livid scar down the
left side of his face and his eyes were
set horizontally a sure sign of manchu
descent because all southern chinese
have the oblique mongolian eye
though prepared for treachery of-some
kind the very simplicity of the scheme
almost disconcerted him and he blurted
out the first words that rose to his lips

  is your name wong li fu he
demanded

  half unconsciously a hand dropped
to the pocket containing the revolver
for answer he was struck a violent
blow on the throat and sent sprawling
the attack was so sudden that he was
nearly unprepared for it-nearly not
quite because a flare of baffled spite in
the dark eyes gave him a ghost of a
warning it was fortunate that he
saved himself by a slight backward
flinching since he learned subsequently
that his assailant was a master of
jiu-jitsu and that vicious blow was
intended to paralyze the nerves which
cluster around the cricoid cartilage
hat ie received the punch in its full
force he would at least have been dis-
abled for the remainder of the day

while there was some chance of the
injurys proving fatal

the chinaman instantly seized the
a terrified girl in an irresistible grip
and was about to thrust her into the
automobile when a big burly man flung
himself into the fray and collared the
desperado by neck and arm

  quit that now he said authorita-
tively hands off the young lady or
ill shake the life out of you

  by this time theydon was on his feet
again and rushing to the assistance
of detective steingall who seemed
to have miraculously dropped from the
skies at the right moment the china-
man seeing that he was in imminent
danger of capture released evelyn
wrenched himself free by another jiu-
jitsu trick swung the girl into stein-
galls arms thus impeding him and
leaped into the car which made off with
a rush

  naturally the people coming out
from the depot reinforced by the crowd
of semi-loafers always in evidence in
such localities gathered in scores
around evelyn forbes and her two pro-
tectors such an extraordinary scuffle
was bound to attract a crowd few had
seen the commencement of the fray
because nothing could be more usual
and commonplace in a quietly fashion-
able place like oyster bay than the
sight of a gentleman handing a well-
dressed lady into an automobile the
first general intimation of something
bizarre and sensational was provided
by theydons fall after that events
traveled rapidly and the majority of the
onlookers imagined that it was stein-
gall who had knocked theydon off his
balance while the rush made by the
latter to intercept wong li fu was
actually stopped by a well-intentioned
railway employee

  worst of all theydon was quite
unable to speak he indulged in val-
iant pantomime and steingall fully
understood that the chinamans escape
should be prevented at all hazards but
steingall could only accept the inevi-
table the landaulette was equipp 
with a powerful engine and the c ty
vehicles available for pursuit were some
ancient horse-drawn cabs he noted


the blue book magazine

the number on the identification plate
and that was the limit of his resources

for the moment

  moreover evelyn forbes finding
herself clutched lightly by a tall stout
man whom she had never seen before
was rather more indignant than hurt

  disengaging herself from the detect-
ives hands she looked to theydon for
an explanation

  has everybody gone mad she said
vehemently  what is the meaning of
this did you know who that man
was and why did he try to force me
into his car

c lowly regaining his breath thev-
don stammered brokenly that he
would make things clear in a minute or
so then he gasped to steingall
that is wong li fu-the man
wanted-at number seventeen

  well get him all right was the
grimly curt answer meanwhile are
you and miss forbes going to the
hotel

  hardly less surprising than stem-
galls appearance on the scene was his
seeming knowledge of the purpose of
their journey

  we must side-step this crowd he
went on gazing around wrathfully at
the ring of curious faces here you 
he cried singling out a policeman who
was forcing a passage through the mob
clear away this bunch of gapers and
get us a cab

  the policeman seemed inclined to
resent these masterful directions but a
word whispered in his ear when he
reached steingall acted like magic and
he soon had the group of onlookers
scattered

  a cab was called and evelyn forbes
was already inside when theydon re-
membered the englishman he looked
around but could see nothing of him

  where is-mr handyside he
said still finding a good deal of diffi-
culty in articulating his words

  is that the man who came with you
from new york inquired steingall
yes hes-an englishman
well he may have been scared and

made a bee-line for london hes
not anywhere in sight

  oh please mr theydon do let us
go to the hotel pleaded evelyn she
was pale and yielding to reaction after
the excitement of the fracas

  unwillingly since he was certain now
that there were absolutely no grounds
for the girls alarm on her mothers
account-at any rate so far as illness
was concerned-theydon entered the
cab and steingall followed

  the first thing to do said the
canny steingall when they were en
route is to assure this young lady
whom i take for miss forbes that she
has probably been brought to oyster
bay by a lying telegram and that her
mother is quite well in health sec-
ondly why should wong li fu be
described as the man wanted in the
innesmore inquiry and thirdly how
nd when did mr handyside come on
the screen

  i cant-talk-just yet wheezed
theydon hoarsely in a few min-
utes-ill-tell you everything

  evelyn had not realized earlier that
her self-appointed champion had been
seriously hurt she was deeply con-
cerned and wanted to take him
straight to the nearest doctor

  but he smiled and essayed to calm
her fears by whispering that he would
soon be fully recovered it was pleas-
ant to know that he had succeeded in
rescuing her from some indefinable
though none the less deadly peril yet
the insistent question in his subcon-
scious mind was not connected with
evelyns escape or the flight of her
assailant or the mysterious presence of
detective steingall but with the van-
ishing of mr handyside what had
become of him it was the maddest
of fantasies to imagine that he could
be bound up in some way with the
young manchus yet why did he fail
to turn up at the critical moment
theydon could not even guess at a
plausible explanation he leaned back
in the cab and closed his eyes really
there were times in life when it would
be a relief to faint

                cliatlesslet sanders

as she stepped down from the
suburban trolley-car virginia
found herself in the heart of
the driving march storm
the storm had been pounding at the car
all the way from the big ohio city
where she had taken it to jetsons
harbor which was her destination
she had watched it shudderingly
through the clouded window

  now the wild wind buffeted her and
the sleet stung her face and the rain
drenched her to the skin she staggered
across the slippery pavement and put
down her suit-case at the curb there
was a drug store on the
corner and after a
moment of hesitation
she entered it at the
door a man in oilskins
stood aside to permit
her to pass the clerk
came forward affably
after the manner of
clerks attracted by

                    an

charles wesley
sanders always has a
real story to tell and he has
a rare gift tor terse word-
sparing expression this tale
of the great lakes is one of
his best



extremely pretty girl apparently in
distress

  and it was a distressed face which
virginia turned to the young man
there was a cloud of uncertainty in
her very brown eyes and a pucker
between them her red-lipped mouth
drooped a little the clerk found her
pale though usually virginia was rosy-
cheeked the clerk noticed however
that her brown hair curled all the more
tightly on account of the rain it was
the crinkly kind of hair that could
never become straggly

  i want to go to  alburn street
virginia said in a low
throaty voice i won-
dered if you could
direct me

 as she spoke the
address the man at the
door turned the clerk
reached for the thin
city-directory while he
was fingering its leaves


the blue book magazine

the man at the door moved to virginias

side

  excuse me he said youre
lookin for the jordans aint you jts
only three blocks to where they live
ill take you there if you like

  virginia fresh from the country
hesitated anew the doubt in her eyes
was deeper as she raised them to the
mans what she saw reassured her a
little the mans eyes were large and
bright blue his face had been
bronzed and hardened by weather and
labor it was a big face but it held a
quick and kind intelligence

t ie clerk looked np and noticed vir-
 ginias hesitation he closed the

directory

  its all right if captain bob says so
lady he told her everybody
knows captain bob in the harbor

here

  well- virginia yielded

come right along said captain
eob well he there in a minute

i thought i saw you carrying

a suit-case when you got off the car

  its outside said virginia

  outside captain bob picked up the
suit-case virginia made a murmur of
protest captain bob looked down on
her with a smile

  one of us has got to carry it he
said do you think it ought to be
you 

  in spite of her anxiety virginia had
to return the smile it was a fine
wholesome smile which seemed to bid
virginia to forget her troubles they
turned into the street running along-
side the drug-store and there the wind
smote them mightily it leaped up the
hill as if eager to get at them vir-
ginia gasped and struggled with her
skirts

  you better take mv arm captain
bob said

  virginia thought that rather an in-
timate thing to do but she had no
choice alone she could scarcely keep
her feet she tucked her wet gloved
hand under captain bobs big elbow
and together they fought their way
along

  this is the place said captain eob
after fifteen minutes hard walking

  oh thank you virginia breathed

  go right along in said the cap-
tain im going in too

  oh said v irginia you know
them 

  rather dick jordan is one of my
men

cousin dick jordan was she knew a
great lakes fisherman working for
the past few years out of jetsons har-
bor captain bob must be his boss
master of the tug dick worked on

  virginia preceded the captain up the
walk he followed her closely and
reached around her and knocked on
the door there was a stir within and
the door was flung open a heavily
built blonde young woman stood on
the threshold for a moment she stared
at virginia and then she sprang for-
ward and clasped virginia wet clothes
and all to her breast

  virginia she cried why vir-
ginia  why in the world didnt you
let us know you were coming sos we
could have met you  the idea of your
trustin youself to a scamp like cap-
tain-why virginia dear

  she broke off her raillery and her
voice fell to touch the note of a mothers
croon for virginia had dropped her
head to the girls ample shoulder and
was sobbing so unrestrainedly that her
whole young body shook

  the girl quickly drew her inside
captain bob paused with the suit-case
in his hand but the girl ordered him in
with a vigorous backward jerk of her
head he entered and closed the door
behind him

  you come right up to my room vir-
ginia the girl said you must get
those wet clothes off

  she seized the suit-case and putting
her arm around virginia helped her up
the stairs captain bob went into the
parlor there he met another man
coming toward the door

  whats the row dick jordan
asked

  darned if i know captain bob
answered i found a little girl at the
drug-store inquirin her way to your
house i fetched her here and she
a girl who was afraid



busted out cryin right on marys
shoulder

   pretty little brown-eyed girl-shy
sweet little girl dick asked

  that fits said captain bob
why thats our cousin virginia
from down state dick said wonder
what brings her here you say she
was cryin what made her cry i
wonder

   i give it up said captain bob
well come in and dry yourself
dick said theyll be down before
long

  captain bob went to the kitchen and
removed his oilskins he stood forth
then neatly dressed in blue widi a blue
shirt his clothes were dry but he
sat down beside the base-bumer he
was a handsome sailor lad as he sat
there listening for some sound of the
girls returning in the lamp-light his
eyes sparkled and there was even
more color than usual in his cheeks
his close-cropped black hair lay damp
on his smooth forehead his stocky
figure suggested repose and strength

  i aint keepin you from doin any-
thing am i dick he asked after a
while

  as if that would make any dif-
ference to you dick scoffed you
know youre goin to sit here till vir-
ginia comes down whether it bothers
me or not aint she a nice little girl 
shes a dandy little girl dick the
captain said when we were coming
along through the rain with her hang-
ing to my arm and peeking up into my
face every now and then-say-well
never mind

  and captain bob did not smile he
could still see those appealing brown
eyes and feel that light clasp on his
heavily muscled arm

fjpstairs virginia had got off her
wet clothing and put on a warm
dark house-dress mary had combed
out the crinkly dark hair that needed
no combing virginia had dried her
eyes but now and then a sob shivered
through her

  i had to run away mary virginia
said in a low voice jimmy is gone
and i dont know where he is i had
no place to come but here and i didnt

have time to let you know is it all
right do i have to tell you anything
more to-night

  its as right as right can be and
you dont need to tell me a thing now
or ever said mary and kissed her
heartily well go downstairs now
and ill make you some hot coffee and
get you something to eat

  a moment more and they were in
the sitting-room captain bob rose
and he and virginia were face to face
mary hustled dick into the kitchen to
help her with the fire in the cook-
stove

  i declare she said if captain bob
aint hit at last i dont think he ever
looked at a girl before and just see
how hes eating virginia up with his

eyes

  in the sitting-room virginia mur-
mured 

  im much obliged to you for helping
me with my suit-case

  oh thats all right said captain
bob

  virginias color came rushing back
they sat down and then they could
find nothing else to say till mary and
dick came back but over the coffee
captain bobs tongue was loosened and
he talked a good deal about the only
things he was familiar with-the great
lakes and fishing

  if its fine to-morrow ill come and
get you and well go out on the break-
water he said at parting its quite
a sight-the docks and the ships in the
harbor and-and everything

  id like to go said virginia who
seemed somehow to have forgotten her
trouble a little

aptain bob came the net after-
noon as soon as dinner was over
there was a biting wind off the lake
but the sun was shining the captain
and virginia walked down to the docks
where the great freighters were being
outfitted for the summer once in a
while as they avalked out to the pier
captain bob touched virginias elbow
to steady her over a particularly rough
bit of planking at those times he
watched the color come and go in her
smooth oval cheek

  when they came to the end of the


the blue book magazine

docks and the concrete pier lay straight
ahead of them out to the lights the
wind caught at them and roared past
them virginia gasped and stepped
back to the lee of the last warehouse
she stood gazing out across the blue-
gray waters here and there white-
caps were breaking

  suddenly virginias eyes filled with
tears she bit her lip and turned her
face from the captain she looked so
small and helpless in her mysterious
grief that the captain felt a lump come
into his own throat

  youre in some kind of trouble he
said impulsively is there anything
i can do

  no oh no she said only it looks
so lonely-so forbidding dont you
ever get afraid of it

  the captain lifted his head and
laughed

  i love it he answered its given
me my living ever sence i was a kid

  she looked at him with eyes in which
her tears still shone

  yes i suppose you would be like
that she said but it makes me
afraid

  they turned back she was very
quiet the captain did not speak for
he felt that he was outside her
thoughts  it made him a little unhappy

  their slow strolling brought them
presently to the foot of the hill the
girl turned for a last look toward the
take as she did so a man stepped out
from the lee of the corner building
with his eyes fixed steadily on the girl
he advanced toward her captain bob
knew everyone in the village but he
did not know this man yet the man
seemed to know the girl

rthe man was within three feet of
the girl when she turned she
uttered a kind of strangled cry and
drew back quickly her hand at her
breast her face had gone white she
was trembling captain bob took her
by the arm

  what is it he asked is this
fellow bothering you  if he is just say
the word and ill throw him in the
river

  oh no you mustnt virginia -said
and she faced the newcomer

  well lie said smoothly youve led

me quite a chase he smiled grimly
didnt you suppose id have you
watched i knew the moment you
left and about the moment you arrived
here you had an idea your brother
had got safely away and so you ran

    id like to talk to you alone

i know just where your brother is i
had him watched too you know

  will you leave us please the girl
asked captain bob

  captain bobs abundant muscles
tightened all over his body he eyed
the stranger malevolently he dis-
liked the mans looks he was a sandy-
haired pallid weak-looking imitation
of a man thought the captain he
didnt relish leaving the girl with him
especially since he seemed to have
frightened her by some sort of veiled
threat

  not so you could notice it lie
answered roughly ill just stick
around and see what your friend tries
to pull off his ready anger was
mounting he turned on the stranger
if youll just excuse yourself a
moment he said well take a walk
we can settle this little matter man to
man in about four seconds

  im talking to this young lady

  and im talking to you i-

  captain bob please leave us alone
the girl said

captain bob turned on her she
was still white and shrinking
her great brown eyes looked larger
than ever because of her pallor
and they pleaded with him to do as
she said

  but captain bob was a fighting man
sprung of a long line of fighting men
the smell of the salt had been in the
nostrils of his forefathers in the old
sailing days his women had cradled
their children to the sound of wind and
wave in times of stress he knew no
way but to do battle for those for whom
he cared and he had liked virginia
from the first

  are you afraid of-that he de-
manded

  yes im afraid of him

  captain bobs shoulders swayed from
the impulse to strike the man but he
a girl who was afraid



suddenly remembered that he had no
claim on virginia twenty-four hours
ago he had not even known her he
might make a fool of himself and get
no thanks

  you know the way home do you 
he asked

  oh yes virginia answered

  he turned up the hill virginia sent
a look of dumb misery after him but
he did not see it he was simple enough
to be angry with her and a little scorn-
ful of her he had often said he
couldnt abide cowardice in man or
woman and he thought virginia was a
coward why didnt she spurn the
man let him plant his fist in the mans
face and thus settle the matter

a s captain bob reached the comer
 of the street on which the jordans
lived he paused irresolutely he had
a notion to go and tell mary what had
happened mary had sense virginia
was her guest it might be only fair
to tell mary what was going on but
he knew he could not do that and he
started on again

  there was a rush of little feet behind
him and his name was softly called
he wheeled virginia faced him she
was breathless with excitement he
noticed that the pupils of her eyes had
widened so that now her eyes seemed
black

  captain bob she said i want to
explain perhaps you dont care but
i-i dont want you to go and leave me
only the recollection of the way you
looked  youve been nice to me

    im engaged to marry that

manmy brother was employed

in his bank back home my brother
stole some money that man said he
wouldnt do anything about it if i
would marry him he had asked me a

thousand times beforei loved

my brother and so-i became en-
gaged then my brother disappeared
and i ran away i hoped my brother
was safe somewhere but that man
told me he has tracked him just as he
tracked me so you see ive got to
keep my promise ive got to go home
next week hed put my brother in
jail my brothers so young and so-
so helpless he didnt mean to do

wrong   you see dont you cap-
tain bob

  darned if i do said blunt captain
bob if the kid is a thief he ought
to go to prison i aint got no use for
this martyr stuff let every man pay
his own score i say he lifted his
head and his blue eyes shone what
right has this lad got to ask you to sell
yourself he challenged her

  but he hasnt asked me she said
he doesnt know anything about it
he wouldnt let me if he knew

  well he stole and then run away
and left you to face the music the
captain said a fine piece of a man
he must be my girl we havent got
any use for such people down here we
dont understand people like that

we play the game all the time

you take my tip and pass this
man up

  she lifted her white face to his
appealingly as if he were a judge who
had passed sentence on her and hers
but she found no relenting in his proud
face she saw that for him life was
exceedingly simple he would enter
into no situation which made it com-
plex

  i cant she said

  very well said captain bob and
in his righteousness he turned away
from her and so left her

t irginia went wearily back to the
v jordans she was doubly unhappy
now her case had been bad enough
before when she had been about to
give up her liberty odiously now she
was to give up captain bob az well
all that night she lay staring into the
dark she tried to find a way out but
there was none she could not let the
brother she loved go to jail

  she was still in bed next morning
when she heard mary mounting the
stairs mary came in hastily she
was as near to excitement as her calm
nature ever permitted her to be she
held a little book and a letter out to
virginia

  its a special-delivery letter she
said sign right there

  virginia signed and mary went
downstairs to return the book vir-
ginia looked at the address on the


the blue book magazine

envelope the letter had been originally
sent to her home and had been for-
warded to her by the postmaster whom
alone she had trusted with her new

address

  she broke the seal and drew out
three pages of closely written letter-
paper she read the letter rapidly at
the end she bowed her head and her
tears flowed out on the boyish hand-
writing

  oh jimmie jimmie she sobbed

  the storm of her grief subsided in a
moment she sprang from bed and
dressed down-
stairs she found
mary in the
kitchen v i r -
ginias eyes were
shining and her
cheeks were
pink

  mary she
said ive had
a letter from
my brother i
want to tell cap-
tain bob about
it first if you
dont mind

where can i
find him

  you cant find him till to-night
dear mary said he took his fishing
tug out this morning for its first trip
unless the weather should turn bad the
tug wont come in till night

  oh do you think they might be
caught in a storm  virginia asked

  mar glanced through the kitchen
window the sun had risen in a clear
east but low-hung clouds had filled the
sky to the north and west it was a
march day typical of the lake coast its
beginning gave no guarantee of what
its ending would be

  you never can tell what will happen
to us fisher-folk in the spring ana the
fall mary said soherly but captain
bob is careful hell come in if the
weather changes

a ll day virginia sat by a window
and watched the sky once or
twice there was a flicker of rain out of
the northwest the wind moaned softly
throughout the day then toward five

oclock it suddenly died darkness
came down swiftly

  virginia went to the front door and
looked out afar she could hear an
ore-train making its weary way that
seemed to be the only sound soon that
died away murmurously in the distance
brooding silence wrapped the village
the street-lamps began to glow into
life a couple of pedestrians hurried
by glancing apprehensively at the sky

  mary came and stood at virginias
elbow slipping her arm about the girls
waist mary looked at the northwest

out of the dark-
ness of the sud-
den night a
looming shape
seemed to de-
fine itself there
mary knew it
was a bank of
jet wind-clouds

  come in
virginia she
said in a low
voice

   v i rg in i as
ears were at-
tuned for a note
of alarm in
marys voice she found it-and she
did not stir

  theres going to be a storm-a bad
storm-isnt there mary she asked

  we cant tell how bad it will be
mary answered storms on the lake
come in a minute at this time of year
but dont worry dear captain bob is
inside the breakwater by this time more
than likely

  but suppose he isnt suppose he
should be caught outside in a terrible
storm is there anyone to help him 
the life-saving station isnt open
yet mary answered it will open
right away now that one tug has gone
out thats all thats needed that
opens navigation for the life-savers
but is there no one else virginia
asked

   if captain bob got into trouble he
would flare mary answered if a
tug could get out to him it would go
if it couldnt get out-why they would

just have to take their chances

as virginia half turned there was a
mutter out of the hidden shape in
the northwest then there was a soft
easy flare of lightning much like heat-
lightning in summer for that instant
it looked as if the storm would break
gently but of a sudden there was a
rocking crash and the sky was split by
a living zigzag line of lightning still
there was no rain

  virginia turned swiftly back into the
house and ran up the stairs when she
reappeared from her room she had on
a long raincoat with a scarf tied tightly
over her head

  virginia where are you going
mary cried

  down to the docks virginia
answered i want to see if captain
bob is in if hes out there in this
storm perhaps theres something i can
do

  mary prisoned the slighter girl in her
arms

  you poor child  she said theres
nothing you can do if there is any-
thing to be done its work for men

  but im going to see virginia
declared

  mary stepped back and scanned her
cousins face in virginias eyes there
was a light from an inward flame
stronger than anything that burned in
marys breast stronger than anything
that had ever burned in virginias
before mary understood in the
thought of captain bobs peril vir-
ginia had forgotten her native timidity
if captain bob were in danger she
wished -to be in danger too it was
womans age-old instinct toward self-
immolation

  wait mary said ill go with
you

  as they went down the hill toward
the docks the wind began to rise again
by the time they reached the docks it
was sobbing along the river backing the
dark water away from the mouth
now and then thunder crashed in the
northwest and lightning ran up the
sky

  the docks were dark and silent the
big freighters loomed up dull dark
motionless shapes here and there a
fish-tug hugged up to the piling vir-
ginia and mary walked to the end of

the docks without encountering anyone
beyond them the basins inside the far
breakwaters lay lonely silent and
unlighted

  captain bobs boat isnt in mary
screamed at virginia

  can we get out to the lighthouse
virginia screamed back

  mary nodded more than virginia
she understood the peril captain bobs
boat was in doubtless by now he was
headed toward the gap but the gap
would not show in the dark if the sea
began to run as it surely would in a
few minutes he would have nothing to
guide him his little craft would be as
likely to be dashed against the break-
water and pound to pieces there as to
make the harbor

vary put out her hand virginia

i	a clasped it tightly and together
they stepped out from the shelter of the
last building virginia remembered
curiously how she and captain bob had
stood there just a few hours before

  the wind still rising had free sweep
of them as they made their way along
the pier it snatched their breath away
so that they had every once in a while
to turn their backs and it wound their
skirts about them so that they could
scarcely walk but they kept on and
after what seemed a long time they
gained the lighthouse

  they stood behind this a moment to
get their breaths virginia was panting
and her body was shaking she sank
down on the lighthouse base mary
stronger than she got herself together
first she moved cautiously to the side
of the lighthouse and peered around it
on the instant she was back clutching
at virginias sleeve

  theyre out there she cried
-captain bob and dick and the other
mentheyre-theyre-oh vir-
ginia theyre flaring

  virginia felt her heart turn to ice
her nerves went dead as if they had
been charged with an electric current
and the current had been suddenly
turned off she put her lips to marys
ear

  weve got to keep cool she said
maybe we can help them what can
we do
the blue book magazine

  with a shudder mary looked out
across the east basin lightning flared
up and held the basin was as illumi-
nated as if at midday inside the big
concrete breakwater the sea was com-
paratively smooth though outside the
waves were already beginning to dash
against it and break in a smother of

p fheyve got to have a light mary
said i think thats what theyre
flaring for there hasnt been enough
sea to damage their steering-gear yet
or to put out their fires they are
probably headed inshore but theyre
afraid they cant make the gap there
isnt time to go for help captain bobs
boat is fast and he will be coming in

under a full headthere ought

to be a flare on the east arm of the
breakwater-out there virginia where

the storm iscaptain bob has a

launch at the shore end of the pier i

can run itits smooth enough

inside the breakwaterwe can

eet some oily waste from the car-
doxes

  virginia felt a surge of terror
through her whole being her mind
was working like some high-power
machine and her imagination was vivid
in a breath she could see herself and
mary in the little launch speeding out
to where the storm was wreaking its

furyshe put her hand on

marys arm and started along the
pier

  they came to a string of ore-laden
cars along the shore and mary showed
virginia how to dig the oil-soaked
waste out of the car-boxes by the
time mary brought the launch around
virginia had a pile of it ready regard-
less of the oil they gathered it up in
armfuls and put it into the boat then
mary headed the launch out across the
basin toward the breakwater

the lightning flared constantly now
and thunder crashed and broke and
died in the distance big drops of rain
began to fall and soon there was a
torrent of it mary peered ahead but
virginia dropped her face to her knees
and hugged herself together before the
blast she was conscious of little feel-
ing except the flame of hope in her

brain she whispered to herself that
she was not afraid

  she was roused by the bumping of
the boat against the breakwater she
lifted her head the boom of the
waves on the outer side of the break-
water filled her ears white spray
broke above her and dashed over her
when the lightning flared again she
saw that they were close to the gap and
that through it the water was pouring
without restraint the wash of it
caused the launch to dance

  mary held the nose of the boat
against the concrete it constantly
tried to pull away as the gap-current
caught it it seemed to be a thing alive
conscious of the peril to itself and its
passengers

  with her left hand mary tore open
the bosom of her waist and drew forth
a little oilskin packet she held out her
hand and virginia crept aft and took
the packet from her

  matches mary screamed take
an armful of waste and pile it up on top
of the breakwater touch a match to
it as soon as you get it up there

  virginia hugged an armful of waste
up to her and got back to the bow
twice she tried to stand but each time
she had to sink back the boat rocked
so that she was afraid she would be
pitched overboard but on her third
attempt she managed to hoist the waste
to the top of the breakwater she
struck a match on the under side of one
of the boat-seats it flickered and died
another suffered a like fate with a
moan she struck another was she to
fail here just at the crucial moment
the third match flared up flickered in
the wind almost went out and then
grew to life between her hollowed
hands she reached up quickly and
thrust it into the waste

  for an instant the waste sizzled and
then it suddenly sprang into red smoky
flame its light went out across the
nark

  watch it mary cried as soon
as it burns down a little throw on more

waste

  for five minutes virginia fed the
flare at the end of that time she piled
on the last of the waste her hands
were numb and her body was so nearly
a girl who was afraid



paralyzed that she could scarcely move
to gather up the flares fuel now she
sank down to the bottom of the boat

  that was the last of their signal up
there in the pelting rain and the dash-
ing spray if captain bob had not seen
now he would never see any signal

from themthe waste burned

steadily on wavering and flickering and
being nearly gone half a dozen times

then slowly it began to die

virginia huddled herself on her knees
and began to pray incoherently

  now the rain was a flood the
lightning was intermittent the thun-
der had almost ceased but the wind
howled along the wide expanse beyond
the breakwater

out of the darkness came the hoarse
cry of the tugs whistle mary
screamed hysterically virginia only
huddled further down on the bottom of
the boat

  she was so huddled when the for-
ward lights of captain bobs tug
showed at the gap the tug wallowed
narrowly missing the east abutment
the aft lights showed and the tug
came through it kept on for a hun-
dred feet and then it came round out
of the sea and into the smoother water
its engines were shut off and mary
screamed there was an answering
shout from some one in the bow of the
boat

  the tug had come to a standstill
mary put the launch about and came
alongside captain bob leaned down
then he sprang and landed deftly in
the center of the launch

  mary he yelled

  never mind me mary cried
look after virginia

  she pointed to the huddled figure
and captain bob with a cry that
seemed to tear up from his heart bent
and gathered virginia up in his arms
dick jordan appeared in the tugs bow
mary threw him the rope and he made

it fast he held his hands down to
mary and she clambered over the side
captain bob passed virginia up and
followed her then he took her from
dick again and ran to the engine-room
door mary followed him

  get us ashore quick captain bob
ordered his engineer

tvhen virginia opened her eyes
 she was in her own bed with hot
irons at her feet mary was standing
beside her mary put a cup of some-
thing hot and pungent to her lips vir-
ginia drank and seemed to doze

  after a while she opened her eyes
again she was very warm and com-
fortable she looked for mary but
mary was not there captain bob
stood where mary had been

  captain bob dropped to his knees
and began to stroke her crinkly hair

  virginia he whispered vir-
ginia 

  suddenly virginia sat up in bed
her dark hair tumbled down about her
shoulders her eyes were shining
her cheeks were pink

  captain bob she said slowly im
not afraid of that man any more i
dont think im afraid of anything after
to-night i had a letter from my
brother to-day that man lied when he
said he knew where he was hes in
canada he got over the border af
buffalo hes going to enlist for the
war he said he had been a coward
but he was going to wipe that out he

may never come backif this

had happened before to-night id have
been afraid for him but now-

  captain bob took her slender hands
in his big ones

  youre not going to be afraid of
anything any more are you virginia
he murmured

  virginia only shook her head she
was afraid to answer lest the tears that
were so very near should come flooding
out

the knowledge will be beat and ground
into him forced into him whether he
wants it or not you see them come
and you see them go you see them live
and you see them die-and by this last
i say you read the most sometimes
as soon as my eyes caught sight of
private llewelyn walking into the bar-
ricks i says to myself

  sergeant flowers i says that
lads been brought up under glass he
knows about as much o the world as
you know o the planet they call the
big dipper

  he was in civilian clothe and
mighty well dressed his hands and-
his face was as white as a society
belles although he was barely grown
he was as fine a figger of a young man
as youd care to see with shoulders
anybody might ha envied he was
good-looking too with his blue eyes
and brown hair but his mouth and
chin they struck me as being a little
weak

  the minute he was in his new khaki
uniform he turned himself loose he
soon went wild the free-and-easy life
of a sojer after his careful guiding at
home completely upset his head by
the time we had spent a year campaign-
ing in the philippines he had sunk al-
most as low as a man can go without
being kicked out o the service with a
dishonorable discharge hanging to him
he drank like a fish swore and gam-
bled like a pirate fought at every
chance he spent half his time in the
guardhouse he played off sick when
there was anything hard on hand
he even sneaked out o the common


that little mother



 duties o the garrison he was a regi-
 mental pariah a outcast a nobody
 among his comrades and i noticed
 that he never wrote any letters home
 nor never got any letters from home

 the regiment was in catbalogan on
 the coast o bloody samar-that
 word bloody belongs to samar the
 same as the word damned belongs to
 a dog in a womans lap we was rest-
 ing after a hard campaign in the in-
 terior and there was a hundred or
 more sick and wounded in the big old
 spanish government building which
 served us as a horspital-and a dozen
 or so o them was waiting for wooden
 overcoats the whole outfit except a
 few old reglar army men like me was
 so lonesome and heartsick and home-
 sick that they couldnt sleep o nights
 only when they was a-doing o guard
 duty

    it was a little after dark and i was
  sergeant o the guard as usual pri-
  vate llewelyn was one o the prisoners
  in walks our captin a good-hearted
  yankee from lewiston maine he
  acknowledges my salute goes straight
  to llewelyns bunk and sets down by
  the side o llewelyn i couldnt help
  a-overhearing what they said

llewelyn begins captin pollard
 mighty kind-like the first thing you
know youre going to get a court-
 martial and be fired out o the army

 youll be disgraced itll be published
in your home papers you know
whatll your folks think about it for
j their sake if not for your own says
he you ought to turn a new leaf

    llewelyn replies like hes talking to
  himself i aint got any folks but
  one

   and there was a quiver in his voice
 that told me and the captin who that
 cne was

   whatll she think of it asks the
 company commander

    llewelyn he looks at the captin and
 frowns she wont neveh know it
 he says it was like this she
 wouldnt let me go into the army says
 he and so i run away and went to the
 neahest city and enlisted undeh a false
 name and with a permit i wrote and
 witnessed myself

  went to jacksonville says the
captin

  how did you know

  the records show it answers cap-
tin pollard besides i know your
dialect

 humph and llewelyn almost
makes a face

  south georgy then guesses the
company commander

  and llewelyns countnance gives it
away that the captin had hit the mark
that time

  did you know goes on captin
pollard that it has been only because
o the mercy of colonel lockwood that
you have not already been courtmar-
tialed

  please tell the colonel foh me that
i said to give his mehcies to somebody
that wants em says llewelyn

  captin pollard that fine good man
got no promise to do better from pri-
vate llewelyn i tell you the boy had
fell to a awful depth the only things
on earth he cared for was something to
drink and somebody to curse gamble
with or fight i dont think he even
cared for the one he had left back in
south georgy to worry her old heart
cut for lack of him

ext afternoon luk bans hordes
of moros pampangas and visay-
ans armed with rifles poisoned bamboo-
spears bolos and silver-mounted flame-
shaped krises that could take away a
mans head at one blow crept down
from the range of scrub-covered hills
that laid half around catbalogan we
was not expecting nothing at all and
they was almost within rifle range of
us before we knowed it the colonel
he put us all in the trenches the span-
iards had dug years before around the
outskirts of the town and there we
waited patient for luk ban to start the
ball to rolling and we knowed well
that the big insurgent had a sperior
force because he never would ha at-
tacked the whole regiment in the day-
time without it

  i remember it as well as if it was
yesterday the sun it was that biling
hot that we was near roasting there on
our stomachs in the trenches there
wasnt a breath o wind from nowheres


the blue book magazine

the prisoners had been armed and sent
out with the rest of us to help defend
against them savages and by my side
iteming not to care nothing at all
about it was the pariah private
llewelyn in his reddish-brown fatigue
uniform and bareheaded i suddenly
begun to feel sorry for him in spite
o inyself i mops my sweating face
with the sleeve o my blue shirt and i
says to him

  kid says i youre in a mighty
bad fix with the regiment sure if you
see any chance to do any redeeming o
yourself  says you better take it

  he shakes his head sullen-like and
looks hard at me with his dissipated
blue eyes

  even if you get your wooden head
shot off i goes on a-getting a little
mad its better than a bobtail dis-
charge-a million times better i says

  not to me it aint llewelyn replies
careless-like i wish he says i had
a quaht jug o gin

  i said something pretty scalding but
i forget just what it was for luk
bans brown men broke in a solid line
from the edge o the jungle that laid
along by the foot o the hills and we
got the order to fire luk bans rifles
opened up too and the hell of war
broke loose upon us all the roar of
our krags drownded out the keen
whine o the mausers and the nasty
coarse hum o the remingtons except
when they come close to the ear

  it lasted until very near sundown
when we drove them back across the
hills it had cost us something to win
that victry the horspital was
crowded full o the wounded among
them being the chaplain who had been
offering the last comforts to a man with
a flung bolo still through him a good
many had went through the door of
death the young regiment in spite o
the victry dropped into a deeper gloom
than ever

among the wounded was me it
was a bullet wound across the tem-
ple and when i come to mvself it was
after night and i was in the horspital
i he thing that brought me back was
the touch of a hand too soft and too
gentle to belong to any man on earth

it was a-smoothing back my red hair
from my bandaged brow i opened
my eyes and looked up into the face of
a little gray old american woman  she
was dressed in solid black she was
smiling but in her blue eyes there was
the shadow of some great worriinent

  say if-if you please maam i
stammers when d-did you come and
who might you be

  in the richest way-down-south
brogue  ever heard she tells me that
her name is mrs halliday and that she
has just arrived a hour before on the
campania maritimas steamer saturn

-the saturnus which now lies twisted
and burnt on the west shore of upper
luzon and her voice reminded me so
much o private llewelyns that i
jumped immediate at the conclusion 
that shes his mother i starts to tell
her where to find llewelyn-which was
in the guardhouse of coursc-when i
happens to think

  lord i says to myself it would
kill that woman to know what he is 
and i decides to bide my time

  pretty soon she walks away and goes i
to another wounded sojer and him 
bad hurt and a-raving delirioushe takes 
her hand and kisses it and calls her
mother 

  my head it commenced to aching and 
not a wink o sleep did i get that whole j
night i raised myself a little and 
there i sets a-looking at the gray little
old woman as she goes from one man to 
another witii her comforting words and
her good smile i remember it as well
as if it was yesterday

  it would be hard for me to tell about
everything she done she petted them
heartsick homesick and wounded young
sojers and wrote last letters for some
who was never to see american shores
no more and once or twice i seen her
on her knees with her hands clasped
and her head bent while some man
passed out we all commenced a-lov-
ing of her she was a mother to us all

  along toward daybreak the big me-
dico he turned over his room in the
downstairs o the horspital building to
her and persuaded her to go to bed for
some rest yes he had had a mother
just the same as anybody else and
when the under doctors offered their
that little mother



quarters instead why the head mcdico
he straightens and looks stern and says 
i claim the honor gentlemen 

  ive seen them come and ive seen
them go ive seen them live and ive
seen them die some are men and
some aint the big doctor was a man

  there was scores of wishful eyes
watched that little lady leave the main
ward and mine was among them

the following day i was discharged
 from the horspital building and as
i enters my company street i meets
captin pollard

  sergeant he says i am going to
give you the job of being orderly to
mrs halliday while she is with us

  i thank you sir captin i says
a-meaning every word of it

  please report to her for duty ser-
geant he says

  and i salutes and makes a staggery
bout-face and returns to the horspital
building just as i takes my place be-
fore the little womans door she opens
it

  i beg leave to say maam says i
that i have been sent to you to be
your orderly

  awdehly says she and what

ii	that suli

  flunky maam i explains i am
to stay close to you maam to do any-
thing you want done

  ah - a suhvant - i undehstand
says she she hands me a chair from
her room then foh goodness sake
she says set down its too tiahsome
to stand theah like that

  not at all i says passing the chair
back its military to stand

  you must obey my awdehs mustnt
you 

  of course maam i agrees

  then suh i awdeh you to set
down says she handing the chair
back to me

  and i obeys orders

  well the whole regiment was soon
a-worshiping mrs halliday during
the time she felt she could spare from
the sick ones in the horspital she went
around among the different companies
with me at her heels and i could tell
easy that she was a-looking for some-
body and one afternoon while we

  was out on one o these rounds she
turns to me and says

  sahgent she says have i seen
every man in this regiment

  now i had to tell a lie i felt so i
salutes and answers with a innocent
face on me

  every man maam i says

  all but them in the prison-i mean
the guardhouse she says and she
looks toward the low stone building a
old spanish carcel that stood down
close to the bay-shore

  oh yes i says all but them in the
guardhouse but i adds there aint
nobody much in the guardhouse you
know maam-just a few raky fel-
lows i says

  i barely caught what she said next
which wasnt meant for my ears at all
she says to herself

  anyway he would neveh be theah
he was too good for that my david

it was only a few hours later that it

	happened the night was as clear as
crystal the tropic stars hung so low
in the sky that a man felt he could reach
them from a housetop they twinkled
and shined like balls of white fire the
breeze was from the landward and it
brought with it the sweet smell of
ylang-ylang and hibiscus the lonesome
cry of a nightbird of the jungle the
acquoo l-acquoo of a iguana off from
the horspital building somewheres come
the jangling of brass strings on a native
guitar and a female voice singing a
melancholy visayan love-song in mi-
nors

  i was a-setting just outside o mrs
hallidays door expecting any minute
to see the thin shaft of candlelight at
my feet fade away which would le my
time to leave suddenly her voice
comes to me low and sad

  oh sahgent flowehs

  yes maam i says

  i went in at her command she was
standing by her open window with her
frail white hands resting on the sill
and her gentle face turned toward the
breeze that brought the smell of ylang-
ylang and hibiscus

  you wanted me maam i says
saluting

  is it too late foh me to go to see


the blue book magazine

the colonel she asks without facing

about

  of course not maam says l

  then i think i will go sahgent

says she

  she puts a shawl or something
around her shoulders and we goes to
headquarters which was in a small
frame building covered with curygated
iron that had bullet-holes in it enough
to ventilate it the door was open
and she walks in i stops on the upper
step the colonel two o the majors
and a captin was gathered around a
little table that had two burning candles
and some campaign plans on it the
officers all bows and greets mrs halli-
day polite

  please have this chair mrs halli-
day invites colonel lockwood

  they all sets down with the big guns
saying how delighted and honored they
felt at her visit

  i come heah to have a talk with you

  shall the others leave us asks the
regimental commander

  i-i guess it aint necessary smiles
mrs halliday colonel she goes on
i come all the way from south geohgy
to look foh my son he was always
such a good boy until he took the ahmy
feveh i wanted to please him but-
but i just couldnt let him go finally

  she stopped and looked down the
colonel glanced toward major thorn-
ton and major thornton said some-
thing i couldnt catch then the little
mother she goes on sadlike

  i have had an ohganic disease of
the heaht foh several yeahs and afleh

running away to be a sojeh

he promised me that if i would let
him go he would come home with the
shouldeh-straps of a captin on him
she says oh he wanted to go so
much

the colonel looks thoughtful when
 he replies to mrs halliday its
plain its all he can do to talk a man
with feelings inside of him was colonel
lockwood

that i will do everything in my power
to find your son for you if you will

way of getting you there without your

morrow suh gentlemen i bid you

  i	went back to the little ladys quar-
that little mother



ters with her when we had reached
her door she turned and smiled at me
and dismissed me then i hurries back
to headquarters and dashes into the
presence o the four commissioned offi-
cers like a whirlwind

  colonel i says out o breath
mighty near i sure beg pardon for
coming to you without permission but
i felt that there wasnt no time to fool
away with red tape colonel says i
private llewelyn the regimental
pariah the outcast and the nobody is
that old womans son as sure as i aint
a leper

  colonel lockwood he knowed about
llewelyn of course the same as the
balance o the regiment did

  impossible cries he

  impossible cries major thorn-
ton

  yes sir i says ive done rea-
soned it all out i heard llewelyn tell
captin pollard that hed enlisted under
a assumed name and with a forged per-
mit because he couldnt enlist any other
way and his brogue is the same as
mrs hallidays and he come from
south georgy too please sir colonel
lockwood i begs let me bring
llewelyn here for you to examine

  bring him nods the colonel

as soon as i seen that dog llewelyn
 i felt like i wanted to horsewhip
him he knowed his mother was there
of course-he couldnt help but know
it-and yet he didnt seem to care noth-
ing about it at all when we entered
headquarters he didnt even stand at
attention

  what is your name asks the colo-
nel a-snapping it out like a rifle-shot

  robeht-

  david and not robert clips the
colonel

  david llewel-

  not llewelyn colonel lockwood
breaks in

  david halliday then grins that
desprate young man

  i thought so and the colonel
lifts his brows david your mother has
but a short time to live and she has
come all the way to the philippines ten
thousand miles to see you once again
before she goes-

  he went on with it and never have
i heard in all my life such a going-
over as david halliday received and
david halliday he felt the force of it
he went red and white by turns once
he staggered and sunk almost to his
knees he begun to beg the colonel to
quit but the colonel wouldnt quit
until he was through i tell you it was
tumble

  and no sooner had colonel lock-
wood reached the end of that awful
grilling when a runner from the horspi-
tal bursts in at the doorway and jerks
out breathless

  shes dying-that little mother-
leakage of the heart-a few minutes at
most-

  then the colonel he interrupts in a
voice like iron

  take off your uniform captin
bruce quick he says-and he faced
back to david halliday youre going
to put on captin bruces uniform-
youre going to deceive her-dye hear
you unspeakable young scoundrel you
belong to m of the sixty-seventh vol-
unteers just arrived at ban pedro up
the coast-dye hear and youve got
to act the part too quick i say cap-
tin bruce for gods sake he says

  he takes captin bruces blouse and
tears away from each side o the collar-
band the crossed guns because they had
the figgers  instead of  on them

in a very short space of time david
 halliday was in a captins uniform
with a captins hat on his head and a
captins sword and scabbard hooked to
a belt around his waist-and damme if
he didnt look like a officer in spite of
himself then the colonel he took
halliday by a arm and went running to-
ward the horspital building with him
with me a-following close in their
wake

  act the part dye hear pants the
regimental commander as they go if
you dont david halliday ill make
you wish you had she come ten thou-
sand miles just to look upon your dirty
villainous scoundrelly face act the
part or ill-ill make you regret that
you was ever bomed

  the regiment had got the news it
was gathered around the horspital
 

the blue book magazine

building waiting silent and mighty
anxious for  fell you it loved her to a
man the colonel and halliday with
me at their heels broke through the

close-packed sojcrs and the colonel
he begun to cry out in a voice that rung
iike the ring o steel so that the little
woman could hear him

  make way there i say make way
for captin halliday of the sixty-sev-
enth volunteers make way there
ahead 

  the sojers divided and we passed
through we hurried into the room
where the little lady set in a big chair
with the head doctor bending oyer her
she was white but she was still alive
as her son went in at the door she seen
him and knowed him

  david  she gasps and the happi-
ness that was in her voice is a thing i
cant tell about

  halliday gave a great sobbing cry
and fell to his knees before her with
her last strength she put out her frail
white arms and put them around him
drawing his head close to her poor old
failing heart

  fohgive me he says all choked in
his throat kneeling there at what i once
heard a good chaplain call the first altar
of life his mothers knee

  ah-a captins-shoulder-straps-
deah son  she mutters and we seen
she tried to tighten her arms and
couldnt dont ask-my fohgiveness
but fohgive me i wanted-to hold-

you-back oh-deah son-

fohgive-me-

  her gray old head fell forward she
kissed the golden bars on his shoulder

  and then she passed out

vte put her to rest in the regiments
vv silk flag under a fragrant ylang-
ylang under starry hibiscus we fired
the three volleys of a sojer over her
and a bugler tried hard to blow taps
while the regiment knelt for it was
the greatest and finest and best sojer of
all that had went to sleep-that little
mother

  david halliday he made of himself
a man like the david of old a man
after gods own heart it become the
work of his life to win the commission
of a captin and he has done it

interest
 in life

     philip gilbs

    philip gibbs is a war corres-
    pondent of distinction and the
    author of much entertaining fiction
    -the joyous lady lor instance
    this story of a young man who was
    bored and of how he came to take
    an interest in life is one of mr

gibbs best

my friend gerard langbaine
has told me many amusing
stories of his experiences as
a pup trainer by which
he means a private tutor but when he
described his four weeks or so with
young ingleton his laughter did not
ring quite true i think the anxiety of
that time accounts for some of the
white hairs which are powdered about
the temples of his fine strong clean-
shaven face

  it was his friendship with lady
ingleton-the widow of ingleton of
india as he was called for his work
on the northwest frontier-which in-
duced langbaine to take in hand a boy
who was obviously in need of mental
and moral discipline

  mr langbaine said this charming
old-fashioned lady whose spirit had
been saddened by her early widowhood
my poor frank terrifies me he is
suffering from a bad nervous break-
down and the doctors can do nothing
with him

  langbaine raised his eyebrows in his
whimsical way

  a nervous breakdown at twenty-
one thats bad whos the lady
but there seemed to be no lady in the
an interest in life



case viscount ingletons illness was
due to a highly strung temperament a
touch of religious doubt too many
egyptian cigarettes quack medicines
with which he stocked his bedroom
mantelshelf literature of a morbid
character and a continual craving for
mental excitements which had their
inevitable reaction in restlessness and
boredom

  langbaine whistled

  bad symptoms for a boy he said
religious doubt plus quack medicine
and egyptian cigarettes are the very
deuce my dear lady ingleton

  she agreed and begged him as her
good friend to look after the boy
for a while-on a business basis of
course-and to restore him to mental
health by those gifts of strength and
comradeship and knowledge of youth
which made gerard langbaine so suc-
cessful with all young men

  if you would take him away to your
couiftry cottage said lady ingleton
i believe it would do him a world of
good and when you bring him back
well to me i will thank god for your
kindness

  she spoke the last words with a
tremor in her voice and though lang-

 baine was halfway through a new novel
 which he wanted to finish in peace and
 quiet this appeal of a charming lady on
 behalf of her son stirred the chivalry in
 the heart of this knightly man

    send the boy along he said and
 i will see what i can do for him with
 golf on a nine-hole course country
 walks with an old-fashioned inn at the
 journeys end my faithful banjo and
 old bounder who is the wisest fellow
 of a dog that ever taught philosophy to
 foolish man

 yyell that was the bargain but
  when young ingleton drove his
 car up the muddy lane outside lang-
 baines country cottage on the high
 woodlands of buckinghamshire and
 called out an irritable question across
 the garden hedge langbaine knew that
 he had invited trouble to be his guest

   where the devil is bramble cot-
 tage  asked viscount ingleton

   this is bramble cottage said
 langbaine very cheerily as he plucked
 a big weed out of a flower-bed and
 wiped some sweat off his forehead with
 a bare bronzed arm but the devil
 aint at home to-day if youre wanting
 him

    the boy in the car permitted himself
 the flicker of a smile and then hard-
 ened his lips and spoke gloomily

   oh i suppose youre mr lang-
 baine im viscount ingleton

    glad youve come said langbaine
 youll be sorry soon the mater
 has sent me down here as a prisoner on
 parole i ought to warn you that my
 nerves have gone to blazes and that ive
 got the giddy jimjams i expect she
 told you

   lady ingleton told me you were a
 bit run down said langbaine but
 youll soon pick up again after a little
 exercise and fresh air look at that
 view my boy des you a bit of good
 doesnt it

   he pointed to the wide stretch of
 landscape sweeping away to a far hori-
 zon of woods which were caught on
 fire by the glow of the afternoon sun
 it was a scene of peace very restful to

	the spirit with long shadows across the
  fields and with a shimmer of golden
  light above the standing corn
the blue book magazine

  viscount ingieton turned in his car
and gazed back with mournful eyes

  horribly boring isnt it nature
always seems to me so devilish monoto-
nous and it makes one think-which
is rotten

  depends in what way you do your
thinking said langbaine at pres-
ent im thinking a good deal about the
psychology of slugs and i find em
extraordinarily entertaining however
come in and make yourself at home
ive some excellent old ale for lunch
which will put the joy of life into your
blood and bones

  hut after putting his car into the
shed behind the cottage unpacking his
bags in the bedroom above the porch
arranging a dozen medicine-bottles on
the mantelshelf and a score of morbid
novels on the book-shelves viscount
ingieton sat down to the luncheon table
without an appetite refused the old ale
and swallowed a headache tablet in a
tumblerful of water then he gave a
great sigh which seemed to come up
from his brown boots and asked the
alarming question

  whats the good of this absurd
thing called life i utterly fail to see
the point of it

  langbaine was getting through half
a pint of old ale in a pewter pot which
glistened like burnished silver and
when he had wiped off a little froth
from his lips he smiled cheerily into
the gloomy eyes of this good-looking
boy who was on the other side of the
gatepost table

  my dear lad dont adopt that silly
old pose its gone out long ago
lifes a jolly game if you keep your
liver working and cultivate a sense of

humorlets have a look at

those pills of yours

  ingieton passed over the box with a
nervous hand

  theyre pretty strong-arsenic and
strychnine i couldnt keep going with-
out them

  couldnt you  asked langbaine
amicably well supposing you have
a try just for the sport of the thing
with a sudden flick of his finger and
thumb he shot the pil -box into the
middle of the old-fashioned fireplace
where some logs were burning

  thats the best place for things like
that he said with a smile

  viscount ingieton sprang up from
the table with a white face and angry

eyes

  look here sir- call that infernal

cheek you know

  his voice suddenly halted as there
was a deep-throated bark from a
shaggy old sheep-dog which had been
asleep by the fireside but now sprang
up with its hair bristling and a glint of
red in its eyes

  lie down you silly old devil f
shouted langbaine this young gentle-
man aint going to be frightened by your
ridiculous temper he knows perfectly
well you havent a tooth in your ugly
old jaw

  to his surprise viscount ingieton
did not seem at all alarmed by the
demonstration of a dog who was ihe
terror of the neighborhood on account
of a somewhat ferocious demeanor and
an insane jealousy of his masters affec-
tions the young man thumped him in
a friendly way on the side of the head
and then fondled him so that old
bounder forgot his anger and made
friends in spite of his nervous break-
down the boy showed pluck and lang-
baine made a mental note in his favor
but he was still angry about the loss of
his drugs and with a touch of aristo-
cratic hauteur which amused langbaine
a good deal begged him not to take
such liberties again with what hap-
pened to be his private property

  my dear chap said langbaine very
calmly i dont allow my friends to
take a slow poison in this cottage and
i make a hobby of putting temptation
out of harms way lets go and have
a round of golf

 or a young man with a nervous

	breakdown viscount ingieton
played a remarkably fair game as far as
he first five holes and he had a strong
leisurely graceful drive which carried
his ball unerringly to the green within
nice putting distance of the hole

  good lord man said langbaine
whats your handicap

  it used to be two said the viscount
in a melancholy voice but ive gone
to pieces now with my rotten nerves
an interest in life



  nerves be blowed  said langbaine
i dont believe youve got a nerve in
your body id give my eyebrows to
have a stroke like that

  viscount ingleton smiled gloomily

  whats the good its a fools
game anyhow

  then he putted home in three with
a careless certainty which took lang-
baines breath away and after heaving
a deep sigh at the unutterable boredom
of things drove off the next tee with a
low ball which just winged across the
bunkers and settled cosily within five
inches of the flag to langbaines
shout of approval he answered with a
short mirthless laugh and waited
silently puffing an egyptian cigarette
with the gravity of a funeral mute
while his opponent made a bad drive
and sent the ball into the rough

  at the fifth tee the young man who
had smoked his third cigarette topped
his ball badly said damn and put-
ting his driver across his knee broke it
deliberately in half and flung the pieces
over the hedge

   cant play for toffee he said with
a frown

  langbaine sat down on the sand-box
and laughed until the tears came into
his eyes

  whats the joke asked viscount
ingleton lighting another egyptian

  langbaine did not explain the joke
but on the way home with laughter still
in his eyes he put his hand on the
young mans shoulder and spoke a few
fatherly words to him

  look here old man i want you to
go easy with those cigarettes of yours
how many do you smoke a day 

  oh im very moderate said ingle-
ton thirty or forty at the most

  well im going to knock you down
to five said langbaine it will be a
saving in golf-clubs as well as in
tobacco so hand over that case of
yours

  ingleton protested violently but
when he was reminded of a promise he
had given to lady ingleton to play the
game according to langbaines rules
for at least a month he yielded up his
case

  i shall be dead before the months
out he said rather piteously

dut the real tragedy came when he
 went up to his room after saying
good night to langbaine who had been
playing ragtime on his banjo as a kind
of musical accompaniment to a con-
versation on the existence of god and
the futility of life viscount ingleton
had confessed that he could see no sign
of god anywhere and that as far as
he was concerned life was a senseless
farce upon which conclusions he
drew up his long legs rose from the
depths of a low armchair nodded to
langbaine patted bounder on the head
and went up the wooden stairs to his
room langbaine listened to his foot-
steps across the landing heard him
light his candle open the bedroom door
and tramp heavily across the polished
ttoards for a few moments there was
silence then there was the sound of
a sharp cry which made old bounder
sit up with his ears cocked

  hulloh said langbaine in a loud
cheery voice is anything the matter
up there

  ingleton flung the door open and
stood at the top of the stairs with his
candlestick in a hand which trembled
violently so that the light of it flickered
on his white face he spoke in a voice
of anguish and rage

  mr langbaine for gods sake
what have you done with my medi-
cine 

  your medicine asked langbaine
calmly oh yes i did remove a lot of
medicine bottles i smelt the drugs in
em and didnt like the stench

  give them back said ingleton
i demand to have them back what
have you done with those bottles 

  he was almost inarticulate with
anger but there was also a sound of
fear in his voice

  the bottles are all right said lang-
baine quite all right theyre in the
scullery but theres nothing in them
i emptied the filthy stuff down the sink
old man

  the effect of those words upon the
young man at the head of the stairs was
extraordinary he gave a moan like a
wounded animal and then letting the
candlestick fall with a crash upon the
topmost stair leaned up against the wall
and sobbed


the blue book magazine

  langbaine was up the stairs in a
moment with his arm round the young

mans shoulders

  my dear lad im sorry im hor-
ribly sorry but all those drugs are
killing you pull yourself together
show your pluck in a few days youll
be able to do without them and life will
be full of fun again

pr more than a week however
there was no fun in life for either
viscount ingleton or gerard lang-
baine the agony of the first night
when langbaine sat by the bedside of
the young drug-victim was succeeded
by days when he was sullen and silent
and moody and dispirited so that lang-
baine could not rouse him after one
or two outbursts of passionate anger
against what he called langbaines
tyranny he became quiescent and
indeed strangely obedient to lang-
baines strong will and masterful spirit
he would go for long walks with the
man whom he seemed to regard as his
jailer he would help him weed the
garden he would play cards with him
in the evening he would even listen
patiently to langbaines fantasias on
the banjo and to his stories of comedy
and tragedy in the street of adventure
but all the time there was a look of
pain in his eyes and about the lines of
his mouth and he had a habit of sighing
with a quick indrawing of breath as
though his spirit were in travail at
night he was restless and sleepless and
would pace up and down the floor with
a white haggard face until sometimes
langbaine would go into his room and
read him into a fitful slumber from
which he would awake with a moan on
his lips

at the end of a fortnight langbaine
saw the first sign of improvement
it was when young ingleton came back
from a lonely walk in the woods one
afternoon while his jailer was writ-
ing a chapter of his novel for which
the publishers were now clamoring
langbaine had been a little nervous and
conscience-stricken about letting the
boy go off alone and he was profoundly
relieved to hear ingletons footsteps
come up the gravel path while old

bounder thumped his tail on the floor

and grinned a welcome

  well my noble lord said lang-
baine looking up from his papers and
smiling had a good walk

first class said ingleton its
splendid in the woods this afternoon

  langbaine glanced at him quickly
there was a cheery note in his voice for
the first lime since his coming to bram-
ble cottage and-actually-there was
a keen clear light in his eyes instead of
the old blank look of sullen despair
the young man seefned aware of lang-
baines penetrating silence for he
flushed a little and then confessed that
he was feeling uncommonly chirpy-
for a wonder

  thats great said langbaine he
thrust the papers away and said
hey ho for a merry game of golf

  it was a good game and ingleton
who borrowed langbaines driver
made a series of hefty hits which put
bogey to bed he came back with a
good appetite for supper and after-
wards suggested a game of dummy
poker for a young man with a nervous
breakdown he bluffed with a cool assur-
ance which not only took langbaines
breath away but also twenty-five of his
hard-earned shillings before the candles
had burned down to their sockets it
was with quite a gay laugh that ingle-
ton shoveled the money into the pockets
of his norfolk jacket and apologized
for his own success

  ive had all the luck to-night he
said

  gerard langbaine did not begrudge
his own losses twenty-five shillings
was cheap for that laughter on the lips
of a boy who had come to bramble
cottage with despair in his face it
was almost as though some miracle had
worked a change in him for he did not
pace his room that night and slept
soundly for the first time

general times during the follow-
 ing fortnight ingleton had slight
relapses when he was again moody and
irritable and when he vowed bitterly
that be was in an intolerable position of
moral bondage to langbaine who
treated him worse than a dog but
he was quick to apologize in a quick
an interest in life



boyish warm-hearted way for these ill-
tempered words and better than that
he showed unmistakably that he had
been cured of the drug habit

  langbaine had a sense of real tri-
umph when at the end of the months
probation which had fulfilled the con-
tract with lady ingieton the boy asked
to stay on a bit

  langbaine smiled and pretended to
look enormously surprised

  what the prisoner on parole is
reluctant to leave his jail

   viscount ingieton blushed in a very
youthful way and then gripped lang-
baines arm

  youve been a splendid pal to me
sir and im frightfully grateful the
fact is im a new man im beginning
to feel that god hasnt got a grudge
against me after all

  good said langbaine thats
fine my lad and as those lonely walks
in the woods seem to agree with you
sling your hook for a couple of hours
and leave me to finish the most weari-
some novel that will ever exasperate
mr mudies customers

  right-o said the young man and
with bounder as his faithful compan-
ion he went off for one of those strolls
in the buckinghamshire woodland
which had helped to give him a new
lease of life

  as it happened however gerard
langbaines last chapter did not run
easily and developed a deep wrinkle in
his forehead the sun was streaming
onto his blotting-pad and having a
streak of paganism in him he heard the
beguiling voice of nature calling him
out of doors

  to the deuce with literature he
said lets go and have a look at
life

put the novelist found life rather too
startling when he came face to face
with it in the dusky woods a mile away
from his house where he had gone in
the hope of meeting ingieton and the
honest bounder it was on a slope of
grass on the edge of the woods by
white cross that he suddenly perceived
bounder no longer honest sitting with
his tongue lolling out and with an idiotic
grin by the side of a young aristocrat

who had been suffering from a nervous
breakdown but who was now in viva-
cious conversation with a girl in a white
frock and a pink sunbonnet the
sudden recognition by the dishonest
bounder of the master whom he had
betrayed by treacherous concealment of
strange secrets caused ingieton and the
girl to spring up in a guilty way as
langbaine approached

viscount ingieton flushed to his tem-
les but made a quick recovery as lang-
aine raised his straw hat and halted
with just a perceptible elevation of his
expressive eyebrows

  well met sir let me introduce
you to miss ella harewood -miss
harewood this is mr langbaine who
looks after my mental and moral well-
being

  not with extraordinary success
said langbaine rather severely but
then he laughed and took the girls
hand and bowed over it

  theres no need of an introduction
ingieton miss harewood and i have
met before i think at her fathers cot-
tage but i didnt know you were a
friend of the family

  i hope to be said viscount ingie-
ton very gravely miss harewood
and i met in rather an unconventional
way about a fortnight ago

  the girl spoke for the first time she
had been rather painfully embarrassed
by langbaines sudden appearance and
a little wave of color had ebbed and
flowed beneath her skin while she kept
her head bent with a little flickering
smile about her lips but now she
looked langbaine straight in tne eyes
and he was pleased with the simplicity
and candor of that glance as well as by
the charm of a face which had not
cxcited his interest when he had first
seen it in the cottage of her father a
retired schoolmaster who seemed to
spend most of his time in tending his
roses in the front garden

  i met lord ingieton in the woods
she said he seemed so unhappy that
i had to stop and speak to him because
i was feeling almost selfishly happy
that afternoon everything was so
beautiful after the rain

and you cheered him up a little
asked langbaine allowing just a


the blue book magazine

twinkle of a smile to creep into his
eyes for a moment

  it was viscount ingleton who
answered

  marvelously i was right down in
the dumps-in a regular cutthroat
mood-but ella-miss harewood 
mean-seemed to put everything all
right it was like meeting a fairy in
the woods if you can understand what
 mean

  he laughed as though he had spoken
jestingly but there was a queer thrill in

his voice

  i understand perfectly said lang-
baine but you were a selfish dog to
keep the fairy princess all to yourself
miss harewood would you come and
have tea with both of us im just as
lonely as lord ingleton and need
cheering up by a fairy lady just as
badly

  oh that would be ripping said
ingleton with boyish enthusiasm

  but ella harewood shook her head

  my father is expecting me back to
tea he would be very angry if i kept
him waiting

  she laughed a little as she added a
few words with a glance at ingleton

  fathers anger makes a coward of
me

  then with a wave of the hand she
fled up a path into the woods and
disappeared like a fairy creature as
ingleton had described her between
the trees

the boy gazed after her and drew a
   deep breath

  lifes a great thing after all he
said in a low voice

  langbaine took him by the arm in
a comradely way he did not want to
play the heavy father with this young
man and he did not object to a youth-
ful flirtation which had helped to give
the lad an interest in life and to lift the
pack of care off his back obviously
the girl ella had been the miracle which
bad wrought the change in him but
the flirtation must not go too far the
girl was the daughter of a middle-
class schoolmaster retired on eighty
pounds a year and ingleton was-vis-
count tngleton of ingleton

  look here old boy said langbaine

dont you go hurting that little girl
we dont want a broken heart in this
respectable village where peace has
dwelt dyou follow me

  i have never hurt any girl yet said
the boy rather haughtily then he
added with more humility

  ive been a blighter in many ways-
but not like that

  good said langbaine i think i
can trust the honor of an ingleton

  and yet he had a nasty shock a few
nights later when he sat late in his bed-
room by the open window an hour
after he had said good night to his
guest who had gone early to bed the
night was warm and the air came
through the window laden with the in-
cense of the earth and grass lang-
baine was wakeful and thoughtful in a
vague dreamy subconscious way but
suddenly his senses became alert for
some time he had been wart chi ng a
queer light which seemed to be blink-
ing intermittently like some kind of
code from a window in the village be-
low what window was it it was
between the church and the tall soli-
tary elm at the cross roads that
would be old harewoods cottage
what was the old gentleman doing at
midnight wagging a lantern about

  rather strange thought gerard
langbaine then he noticed that from
the window next his own another light
was blinking up and down with a dash-
dot dash-dot he could see the rays
streaming out into the darkness lang-
baine raised his eyebrows and smiled
so this was another little trick played
upon him by a young gentleman suffer-
ing from a nervous breakdown he
was signaling to his lady-loves bed-
room window those little flashes of
light were messages of love lang-
baine whistled very softly to himself
this game was going just a little too
far it was about time that viscount
tngleton was returned to his mamma

cuddenly the lights went out and
a few moments later langbaine
heard a door creak in the passage and
quiet footsteps going downstairs old
bounder growled for a moment until
a voice whispered to him in a stride
langbaine was at his own door with
an interest in life



his candlestick raised peering down
into the hall which was also the front
sitting-room

  is there anything you want ingle-
ton

  he saw the boy turn with a start he
had a cap on the peak of which flung
a shadow across his face as he stood
with his back to the table on which he
had placed his candle when he
answered his voice wasnt quite
steady

  im just going out for a breath of
fresh air sir its too hot to sleep
langbaine went down the stairs and
stood in front of ingleton so that the
candlelight fell upon the boys face

  im going to ask you a straight ques-
tion he said rather gravely youre
not going to ella harewoods cottage
are you

  viscount ingleton hesitated for a
moment perhaps falsehood tempted
his lips then he answered haughtily

  as a matter of fact i am just to
say good night through the open win-
dowany objection

  yes said langbaine lots of ob-
jections do you want to hear them
or do you take them for granted 

  i should like to hear them said
ingleton with icy courtesy

  number one i dont want a scan-
dal in the village number two i dont
want a girls heart to be broken in a
foolish game number three while
you are a guest under my roof i ex-
pect you to obey the rules of the house
and my little whims it is one of my
whims that i dont allow any guests of
mine to creep out like thieves after i
have gone to bed

  he had spoken sternly but now he
put his hand on the young mans
shoulder and said very gently and
winningly

  play the game old chap

  but viscount ingleton shrugged his
shoulders and went toward the door

  im sorry he said but i dont
think your whims are quite reasonable
anyhow im going out

  i think not said langbaine

  he slipped past ingleton and stood
with his back to the door

  you will oblige me by going to bed
he said with great courtesy

  viscount ingleton breathed quickly
and his eyes seemed on fire

  mr langbaine he said quietly
you have no possible right to keep me
here a prisoner let me pass sir or i
shall have to put you on one side
langbaine laughed it was really too
absurd

  have a try old lad he said in a
genial way

  but he was hardly prepared when
ingleton stepped back seized a brass
candlestick and raised it swiftly for a
smashing blow

  langbaine stood quite still and spoke
quietly but rather quickly

  i wouldnt do that if i were you
those quiet words disarmed the boy
in a literal way for a moment he still
held the candlestick raised as though
about to strike then his arm fell limp
and the candlestick dropped to the floor

  sorry he said i didnt mean to
hurt you

  without another word he w-alked up-
stairs again and locked himself in his
bedroom langbaine had mastered
him it seemed

in the morning ingleton came down to
 breakfast and without reference to
the scene in the night behaved politely
and as though to show that he harbored
no ill feelings passed the marmalade
pot to langbaine with almost excessive
courtesy

  the fellows a sportsman thought
langbaine yet he decided to take no
risks and soon after luncheon walked
down to harewoods cottage for a little
conversation with the father of the girl
he passed ella in the passage and
though she smiled at him it was
obvious that she had been weeping
she put one hand on his arm and
whispered to him outside the sitting-
room

  father is furious some of the vil-
lagers have been gossiping and telling
tales isnt it absurd

  utterly absurd said langbaine
but annoying too dont you think
she laughed rather pitifully and put
her finger to her lips as langbaine
tapped at the door and went inside the
room where mr harewood was read-
ing his morning post the old man
the blue book magazine



rose courteously but it was cear to
langbaine that he was grievously agi-
tated and that he had just recovered
from one of those outbursts of passion-
ate temper for which he was well
known in the village so that his daugh-
ter was pitied by her friends

  im glad you have come sir he
said  regret however that a guest
of yours should have behaved in a most
dishonorable and disgraceful way to my
daughter

  i-iardly disgraceful said lang-
baine with boyish indiscretion that
is all

  disgraceful sir i repeat said the
old gentleman banging his hand down
on the table they have been meet-
ing in the woods this young whipper-
snapper lord of yours has been seen to
kiss my daughters hand a farmers
boy reported it to the village tap-room
good god sir my daughters honor
and good name have been the subject
of a scandal in the village inn

  he was furious and yet in the midst
of his rage there was also a sign of
fear the thought that a young man
had been making secret love to his
daughter seemed to have terrified him
he had taken his precautions it
appeared with considerable speed ella
was to be packed off to her aunt at
windsor that very afternoon she
had wept bitterly but her tears had
only hardened him

  langbaine defended viscount ingle-
tons moral character and endeavored
to soothe the old gentlemans ruffled
feelings but he was glad to get away
from the cottage and relieved to know
that pretty miss ella was to be removed
from the temptation of an impossible
love old harewood in spite of his
rather comical rage had done the right
thing

itor nearly two hours before tea-
time langbaine strolled through
the woods pondering over his troubles
as a private tutor and over the last
chapter of a novel which would not
come right then he struck home by a
short cut rather remorseful for having
left young ingieton so long alone

  langbaine whistled cheerily as he
came through his garden gate and said

hello boy when old bounder raised
a sleepy head from his paws and
thumped his tail on the red tiles

beneath the porch

  ready for tea ingieton shouted
langbaine looking up at the window of
the boys bedroom where he was
probably reading a novel

  but there was no answer from vis-
count ingieton it was the house-
keeper who came out of the hall look-
ing rather disturbed

  if you please sir his lordship
went off in his car an hour ago he
gave me this before he went

  she held out her hand and in the red
palm of it a sovereign glinted

  went off in his car said lang-
baine blankly

  yes sir his lordship packed twa
of his bags all by himself and then
wrote a letter to you its lying on the
tea-table he only laughed in his
queer way when i begged him to wait
til you came back

  gerard langbaine strode quickly into
the sitting-room some foreboding of
a trouble greater than had yet happened
in this episode of viscount ingieton
made his heart thump he tore open
the letter and read a few lines in a
dazed way they were clear and simple
enough

  dear mr langbaine

    you once said you could trust the
  honor of an ingieton but i think you
  forgot thfise words that was a pity
  for if you had trusted me i should not
  have gone off with ella without letting
  you know her father refuses to see
  me and has bullied her beyond all rea-
  son fts strange that old age is always
  an enemy of youth by the time you
  read this ella and i will be miles avay
  on the beginning of a journey which 
  hope will last as long as life

yours always sincerely

                                  intleton

    p s-i am grateful to you for all
  your kindness though we almost came to
  blows last night

n erard langbaine was al-
ways cool in moments of real
crisis and now he folded up the letter
neatly and put it in his breast pocket
without a trace of the nervousness with
which he had opened it yet when he
had his tea alone there was a curious
little wrinkle in his forehead what
an interest in life



in the world was he going to do he
had only an old bicycle in the shed and
it was no use chasing after a powerful
car which already had an hours start
nor had he the least idea in which
direction the runaways had gone if
he telephoned to the police and puf
them on the track there would be a
pretty scandal which would probably
get into the half-penny papers what
should he say to lady ingleton who
had entrusted her son to his safe-keep-
ing he had made a pretty mess of
things for a young man with a nerv-
ous breakdown viscount ingleton was
the limit that poor mother of his
well she would have to know and the
sooner the better and so langbaine
looked up the next train and then set
off for the station

  a few hours later when he stood in
lady ingletons drawing-room he
would have given all his savings to
avoid telling her that this boy had run
off with a village schoolmasters
daughter whose honor he had com-
promised how could he defend his
own carelessness and the failure of his
trust 

  langbaine knew that he turned a
little pale when the drawing-room door
opened and lady ingleton came in
she came forward to him with out-
stretched hands and a look of glad-
ness

  how can i thank you she said
you have restored my boy to health
and good spirits

  did he write and tell you so  asked
langbaine still more of a coward be-
cause she was so gay

  lady ingleton was holding his hands
and she smiled into his anxious face

  frank is here now

  here said langbaine

  yes with that charming girl of his
they have fled for shelter to my pro-
tecting wings

  langbaine sat down in a chair and
laughed quietly

  well for a young man with a nerv-
ous breakdown that boy of yours is
a masterpiece and to think that i
have been worrying myself into a fiddle-
string

  then he sat up in the chair and asked
an abrupt question

  what are you going to do with the
girl

  keep her said lady ingleton
keep her until we can arrange the
wedding i have fallen in love with
her myself and i think poor frank
would have a relapse without her so
theres nothing else to do

  well in that case said langbaine
with polite sarcasm everything seems
to be nicely arranged and i can go
back to the peacefulness of my country
cottage where i have a novel to
finish

dut in spite of langbaines reluc-
 tance lady ingleton prevailed upon
him to stay to tea her invitation being
cordially though a little nervously
endorsed by viscount ingleton who
came into the room holding ella hare-
woods hand

  youre a pair of wicked wretches
said langbaine gazing at their flushed
faces with mock ferocity i think both
of you ought to be locked up as dangers
to society

  as long as were locked up together
i shouldnt mind a brass button-not
even if it were in bramble cottage
said young ingleton then he caught
hold of langbaines arm and gave it
something like a hug

  youve been a splendid brick to me
sir im sorry for the worry i gave
you

  dont mention it said langbaine
with a pretense of sarcasm it was a
pleasure im sure

  yet after he had received lady
ingletons private thanks a message
from ella pleading for her fathers for-
giveness and a silver cigarette-case as
a keepsake from a viscount who had
sworn off egyptians he was glad to
end an episode which had been un-
usually troublesome walking through
hyde park on the way to his club he
met a friend of his who happened to
be myself after the usual greeting i
ventured to speak of his health

  youre looking a bit fagged out
langbaine you havent had a nervous
breakdown have you

  he gave me a queer look

  yes he said ive had it staying
with me in my country cottage

captain billy wilks

  hendricks arrives in san francisco-
where the port officials having heard
by cable that wilks has babbled of
ames murder confine hendricks
aboard his ship pending an investiga-
tion hendricks escapes and with the
pearls in his belt goes to find susan
mathews legatee of killer ames


hendricks went up the

broad low steps to the great
bronze doors with an awk-
wardness due to long habit
in leaping up ships ladders with their
steep treads at the top he was puzzled
to find the bell discovering it at last
within a circle deeply carved in the
stone lintel he pushed it and turned
to look at the bay in the distance
he saw angel island and the empress
with the yellow flag still flying at
the truck then the door opened and
he faced it to inquire of a staid man-
servant if miss mathews was at home

  the man nodded slightly but said
nothing hendricks found himself sur-
prised that he had the right address
somewhere in the back of his mind he
bad had a suspicion that susan
mathews was a figment of ames imagi-
nation and to find her really living at
the given address startled him but he
recovered quickly and said  will you
tell her its captain hendricks calling
from captain ames please

  ah said the servant drawing
back if you will step in i will ask
if miss mathews is at home

  hendricks entered and was ushered
promptly into a little room off the
reception-hall it was bare and
evidently a place of business he be-
gan to feel that very likely his errand
was to be purely a cold matter-of-fact
transaction without a tinge of romance
to it then the heavy curtain across
the doorway was lifted quickly and he
was face to face with a young woman
who was saying is this the gentleman
from captain ames in a low tone

 im captain hendricks he
answered captain ames asked me
to call

  yes she suggested

  he looked at her and flushed she
was a tall well-made girl dressed in a
style that set off to advantage a fine
figure and carriage she was extremely
handsome with an expressive and
whimsical mouth but her eyes were
as chill as a mountain lake

  to hendricks it seemed as if every-
thing he had experienced in his life of
many vicissitudes was commonplace
beside meeting such a woman he had
not known that the world he had left
so many years ago held such distinctive
and splendid figures his first clear
thought was  must have known girls
like her when i was young his second
ran differently there never has been
anyone like her he felt out of his ele-
ment and shy but instead of proceed-
ing gently about his mission he came
straight to the point

  ames didnt have much time to ex-
plain matters to me he said staring at
his own rough hands he died very
suddenly

  in the stillness he slowly raised his
eyes wondering why she did not speak
he saw her face and its expression
baffled him was it possible that she
did not understand of course such
as she would care little for a rough
customer like ames but surely she
would be surprised-disappointed
maybe and what was that strange
look on her face

dresently she rose turned away

	and went to the window she stood
there in immobility without speaking
hendricks began to fear that he had
really hurt her it might be that she
liked ames-or was a relative

  he never spoke of you she said
at last

  quite likely he admitted much
relieved that she wasnt offended at
him we werent intimate but
when he died i was with him and i
couldnt do much less than listen to his
last wishes could i  there was no one
else

  then he sent a message

  it may be a message hendricks
answered doubtfully possibly it is
as a matter of fact j-ou see he didnt
tell me to tell you anything he only
sent you something so far as i recol-
lect he didnt actually mention any-
thing in the way of a message

  no letter

  no he died suddenly unexpected-
ly to himself i think miss mathews
by chance i was with him when he
was taken sick he realized that he

rrely asked me to
id other things to

was dying and merely
bring his vessel and other
san francisco to you

  she turned her face to him and he
perceived that she was very calm
the schooner you say what else
hendricks slipped one hand into a
side pocket and drew out the cigarette-
case they are in this he said offer-
ing it

  she glanced at the tarnished silver
and then met hendricks eyes and
he-he told you nothing about me
he never mentioned your name in
the two years that i knew him he re-
plied

  you knew him well p she affirmed

quietly he chose you from among
many

  he stared at her in increasing be-
wilderment and then looked at the
cigarctte-case as if it held something
he had not discovered in it he said
curtly i was with him to be sure
eut we werent intimate at all as i
said i was the only man available
he died at sea

  on shore on an island in the
stranger group

  where were the rest she de-
manded werent they there too
the others he said blankly
only a couple of white men-wilks
and peterson

  she shook her head slightly they
-they knew he died before he
could answer she had taken the case
he saw her slender fingers tremble over
it then she looked up at him and he
saw growing distress in her eyes that
had been so cold he was embarrassed
but stammered a reply

  they-they didnt know he said-
now she was facing him with an
intense expression of pain on her face
mingled with one of dread are you
sure-are you certain-that he is-not
alive-still

  hendricks suddenly was aware that
she cared terribly after all she
hoped he perceived the tragedy of
it all and bowed his head i was
with him when he died he responded
in a low tone i believe that is all
the schooner is over at quarantine and
from what i understand there is some
irregularity in the papers something
the temporary heir



done against port regulations i
thought best to leave secretly and come
to you immediately i thought possibly
you might not-possibly you wouldn t
care to be mixed up-in an irregular
affair

what was it she asked quickly
im not sure from what was
hinted i think wilks-an old fellow
who didnt like captain ames-spread
some foolish report in honolulu
about my husband

  your husband  he repeated in a
puzzled tone

  captain ames she answered

he forced himself to look at her still
face he was bitterly disap-
pointed-just why he did not know so
this was the mystery in the life of
killer ames his wife for the first
time he understood a little of the
enormous growth which springs from
the root of a single tragedy why
hadnt some one killed ames before he
had accomplished the vilest act of his
despicable existence it was incredible
that he should have been suffered lo
crown his bestial villainy by winning
the heart of the splendid girl who now
stood silent and tearless in this little
bare room on steiner street

  if i had known he muttered -or
suspected-

  she nodded slightly then as if to
spare him further pain at his blunt
breaking of such news she murmured
i got a divorce long ago our mar-
riage was a mistake she paused a
moment and then continued he never
mentioned me

  never even at the last he said no
name-merely told me i should find
an address in the log-book

  how did you know-were there no
other addresses

  none

  she sighed it was like him if he
had set his mind on a thing being so he
never admitted that it was not so even
to himself it was like him to write
down the address of the one woman
who-who hated him and let the world
think she loved him

  hendricks drew a long breath i
hated him he said quietly

  exactly and yet he knew you

would come all these thousands of
miles on a useless errand just as if you
were his warmest friend and would do
anything for him you obeyed him
even against your will

  i suppose so hendricks replied
hesitatingly ames was a man used
to having what he wanted but in this
case i merely did the decent thing
nothing more

  im glad he sent you and not-one
of his friends she said simply

  they stood in silence sharing an
intimacy for a moment neither one
free to say more than had been said
mrs ames or miss mathews
presently opened the cigarette-case
without haste as she looked at its
contents hendricks was amazed to see
her fine eyes grow misty-two tears
flew down her cheeks

  ah she breathed pearls and
like everything else he ever won they
died in his possession it was his fate
wasnt it-to kill what he loved

  i dont think he knew they were-
spoiled he ventured gently

  she looked at him through suffused
eyes how could he help knowing
yet-it is like him to send them as if
they were precious it is his message
to me

  she cried softly a little while hen-
dricks stared into vacancy unwillingly
seeing again the austere figure of killer
ames dying in a rough shanty on a
desert isle sending dead pearls as a
last legacy to the woman he loved a
message possibly she was right and
ames had spoken no word of farewell
at the end of his lawless life but had
stubbornly silent still seen to it that
she received the sum of his rapine and
robbery-lusterless valueless nacre

  there was nothing to say under such
circumstances his errand was done
he stepped back and laid one hand on
the curtain mrs ames looked at him
a moment and her stormy eyes bade
him farewell feeling that every
second that he remained put him more
firmly in the position of the bearer of
a taunt and an insult he passed out

  the cabman drew the blanket off his
horse and whispered huskily where
now sir downtown

  hendricks glanced down at the bay


the blue book magazine

below the hill glimmering in the last
rays of the setting sun he was a
stranger with no place to go

  the ferry he said at a venture

  back amid the throng of home-going
folks he realized that very likely he
was in quest by the authorities for his
lawless evasion from the schooner and
kissed through the first gate buying a
ticket without asking whither it would
take him he found himself on the
sausalito boat as good as any

that night george hendricks
signed his full name for the first
time in two years-twice when he
had registered and been shown to a
room high up in the rambling hotel on
the hill above the bay he opened the
worn leather belt and extracted the old
draft for two thousand dollars which
had been given him as payment for a
cargo of curios landed in sydney and
endorsed it as he did so it occurred
to him again that killer ames must
have been struck with some qualms
over the fashion in which he had ob-
tained the money and put the paper
aside for further consideration

  at any rate he thought im not
broke gottal will cash it for me he
recalled the alert nervous figure of the
ship-broker who had financed his early
voyages gottal was a good sort-a
crank on queer curios a little prone
to preening himself over his connois-
seurship but a readily kind man and
understanding the oddities of human
nature almost as well as he did the
queer things in which he dealt he had
picked up hendricks in a pawnshop
where the bargain was over a sextant
their conversation had been brief and
to the point

  i beg pardon gottal had said after
a moments impatient listening to the
pawnbrokers eulogy of the battered
instrument i have a better sextant at
my office captain

  hendricks remembered distinctly the
respectful way in which the man be-
hind the counter had nodded and with-
drawn the offered article with an
apologetic smile ah mr gottal
he had said shaking his head you
have spoiled a bargain for this young
man

  nonsense gottal had answered
curtly he knows better than to take
that tiling come on captain well go
to my office then he had turned to
the broker with a brief keep your
eyes open for what i asked you for
levi and led the way out on kearney
street

  my place is on commercial he had
said and they walked silently down to
a small dusty office on that street

  heres the sextant captain the
ship-broker had said handing down a
case

  brand new hendricks had com-
mented

  sure what ship have you

  none going as mate of the mercy
fellows

 nonsense go skipper of the
bertie minor-my schooner-papua

 rum folks the papuans hen-
dricks had remarked

  youll go

  sure said hendricks

  he had made three voyages in the
vessel a nice packet she was too he
thought and he had left her only
when gottal had announced that he had
sold her with the dry remark shes

fetting too well known in the south
eas ill pick up an eastern craft
pretty soon hendricks wait a month
or two

  the event was that hendricks had
grown weary of waiting and shipped
west on a steamer after a farewell
call on gottal who had shaken his
head and snapped all right youll
be around this way some time ill
have something for you

  so now hendricks said to himself
that he must see gottal and ask for
the something promised so long
ago he could explain to the broker
a good many things about killer ames
which few others would understand
also gottal would square matters with
the authorities it was all simple
enough  to-morrow he would settle the
business and soon be outward bound
again ames affair was finished so
far as concerned him let the widow-

events he saw himself entering the
the temporary heir



big mansion on the hill and asking for
miss mathews he felt again the thrill
he had experienced when she had ap-
peared so beautiful and so cold so
exquisite and so fine then there
was his own blunder in telling outright
of ames death and his subsequent
amazement at finding he was speaking
to the killers wife well who could
have suspected it a big house serv-
ants at the door-no one would have
dreamed of finding ames woman in
such surroundings

  suddenly hendricks went to the
window of his little room and stared
out on the bay starred with scattered
lights a new thought had struck him
one certainly did grow ignorant down
under the equator he had naturally
taken it for granted that miss mathews
was the mistress of the steiner street
house why  merely because she had
looked it but she could not have been
especially in view of the fact that she
had received him in what was evidently
a bare business office she was a maid
a servant and this explained a tre-
mendous amount-her quietness her
restrained manner her apparent dread
of becoming excited by his news she
was a servant afraid of disturbing her
mistress or intruding her own affairs
into a household which knew her im-
personally

  my word he said aloud to him-
self of course and it makes it
clear how ames got acquainted with
her she was a pretty servant and he
married her probably she thought
herself lucky to become the wife of a
man who was master of a ship

  this settled to his satisfaction he
decided that he hadnt done all that was
necessary mrs ames - or miss
mathews as she was known to her
employer-couldnt be expected to
know how to proceed in business
matters she would need some one to
tell her about things and guide her
through the intricacies of legal forms
and maritime regulations very pos-
sibly she had no male relatives
at hand she was undoubtedly without
money except what she earned in her
menial capacity ames was a brute
anyway sending worthless pearls to a
wife who had had to go to work to

support herself no wonder she had
shown dread at the thought of not hav-
ing even an absent husband from whom
to hope for help

  at this point hendricks smiled
bitterly at himself ill do it he
resolved but what would my people
say it would strike them as the last
step in my depravity-to stand friend
to a serving-maid he scowled
undutifully committing his family to
limbo what did they ever do for
me he demanded of the night took
somebodys say-so that i had disgraced
them and threw me out on my own

  at first he decided to write miss
mathews a letter assuring her of his
intent to help her then this seemed a
poor way to do the thing anyway how
was he to get an answer with the
police hunting for him as he had little
doubt they were he must be on the
move why not go and see her again 

lje was up and on his return to san

	 francisco by breakfast-time he
had mentally arranged the days pro-
gram and doggedly started out as
he had planned his first call was
on gottal for whom he had to wait an
hour the broker shook hands with-
out expressing surprise and led the
way into a small inner room

  i take it you are the chap who
killed captain ames gottal said
briefly

  no such luck hendricks returned
handing over the draft i brought his
old packet up to the coast after he died
down on one of the strangers

  this draft is moren two years old
the broker continued examining the
paper

  sure i didnt have any need for
the coin

  lucky man i suppose you want
me to cash it for you when the police
are looking for you

  yes hendricks replied lt em
look i didnt kill ames

  who did 

 nobody he was struck with
paralysis died in an hour

  gottal frowned but you skipped
away from the empress without wait-
ing for leave

 of course i did hendricks


the blue book magazine

responded the fools everybody
knows what an ass old wilks is when
i heard that he was yarning down in
honolulu i saw that there was no use
arguing the matter i had business
ashore and i came ashore

  exactly the broker assented
and now they think youre the
murderer its jail for you if they
catch you

  no chance hendricks boasted
just let me have that cash and settle
up a little affair here and im off again
theyll find out quick enough that papa
wilks was drurik and didnt know what
he was talking about

  gottal refused to lose his serious de-
meanor you are in great danger
of your neck my dear sir he expostu-
lated ill give you the money and
carry the draft till some english ad-
vices come in and cash it with them
as if i had got it from london but-
may i ask what this little affair is
about ames wife hendricks re-
turned

 ahem i didnt know he had
one

  it seems he did and shes helpless
and im going to help her get her
rights i dont know that theres much
for her in the whole outfit from what
ive seen of it but shes entitled to
what there is

  have you known her long in-
quired the broker darting his eyes
at everything on his desk as if in quest
of a morsel of common sense to be
instantly offered his visitor

  never knew there was a mrs ames
till yesterday hendricks briefly
explained the events which had led to
his being almost thrust into the posi-
tion of executor of the killers last
will and testament so he concluded
i looked up the address in the old
nians log-book and went ashore dur-
ing the night and next day called on
susan mathews

  gottal stiffened in his chair what
name

susan mathews hendricks re-
peated at  steiner street
youre crazy captain the broker
announced dogmatically do you
know who miss susan mathews is

  i do was the curt reply its

nothing against her that she married

ames in fact she got a divorce and
because she works for her living up in
that big house merely means tliat shes
too proud to live off that brutes
money-if he has any which i doubt

  ottal laughed queerly stared at
vj his caller a moment and then
pushed the button for a clerk who
poked his head in questioningly

  maury go to the bank and get me
two thousand dollars in gold small
gold came the command when the
cleric had vanished gottal swung on
hendricks ive got a schooner loaded
for midway island captain you can
have her if youll sail to-night

  thanks hendricks replied stiffly
i may take you up this afternoon
why not this morning

  ive got to go up and ee miss-
mrs ames again on steiner street

  she-she told you she was a maid
there gottal asked quietly

  no but she must be from all that
i saw naturally she isnt boasting of
having been ames wife she goes by
the name of miss susan mathews
she does does she well young
man my offer holds good till this
afternoon-if you arent in jail before
that time and if i were you id just
keep quiet about miss-er-mrs
ames your story sounds all right to
me but then  im famous for believing
tilings that arent so here comes
your money youh need it

  hendricks stowed the heavy mass of
coin into his pockets without counting
it then he shook hands with the
broker i know what you think he
said abruptly you fancy im travel-
ing around with slaveys and nurse-
maids well i dont seem to be very
much of a person but ill tell you one
thing and that is that miss mathews is
a lady and im not a bit ashamed of
knowing her hard luck comes to the
best of us

  gottal shook hands warmly youre
right captain he said gravely it
does and nobody knows what a queer
world this is till they start believing the
things that nobody thinks could be true
be sure and let me hear from you this
afternoon as hendricks opened the
the temporary heir



door the broker followed him to say
in a low voice if i can be of any
service to-er-miss mathews ill
gladly act but quietly of course 
understood hendricks agreed
and departed

  gottal sat alone in his office for a
long period staring at the dusty ceil-
ing then he picked up the morning
papers and carefully read the brief
news about the arrival of the empress
the secret escape of her unknown skip-
per and the cabled dispatch from
honolulu stating that it had been re-
ported that captain ames had been
slain at sea and his body thrown over-
board while the mutineers sailed the
schooner to honolulu but took fright
there and set sail again leaving on shore
the single passenger captain w wilks
who was very ill but had intimated
enough about the tragedy to warrant
the officials in instituting a sea-wide
search for the alleged murderer one
hendricks who was also charged with
slaying ames loyal mate peterson
the papers ended their stories with
the statement that the authorities were
convinced that it had been hendricks
who brought the empress into san
francisco

  a pretty muddle groaned gottal
and of all the people in the world to
be mixed up in-susan mathews
later he addressed his clerk
maury the orchis will sail to-night
the man you saw in my office will take
her dont make the transfer of mas-
ters at the custom house till i tell
you and dont breathe a word about
anything to anybody not a blessed
word

   know that was hendricks
maury replied in an aggrieved tone

  the deuce you do was the tart
reply but there are a million things
you dont know and never shall

  presently gottal again spoke to
maury by the way if you happen
to be sure that a thing isnt so for
heavens sake dont tell it ten to ore
its exactly the fatal truth

ijendricks arrived before the
steiner street house in mid-after-
noon the sun was still hidden by roll-
ing clouds of fog the avenue was a

gloomy channel through which slow
carts and carriages found their way
under the sullen guidance of chill and
dispirited drivers to a man whose
blood had been long warmed by the
blaze of the tropics the scene was un-
utterably distasteful hendricks shiv-
ered in his light clothes and regretted
the overcoat still on the empress
when he rang the bell the same man-
servant received him-but this time
ushered him into a room quite differ-
ently furnished from the one he
remembered as the scene of his first
interview with miss mathews a
bright coal fire was in the grate and
various articles about showed that it
was intimately tenanted by a woman
almost before he had determined to
seat himself mrs ames came in

  i expected you she said quietly
i thought you wouldnt be afraid to
come

  no he answered why should
i

  didnt you see the papers she
demanded there is trouble over the
empress they say my - captain
ames was murdered with his mate and
that you have fled

  thats old papa wilks talking down
in honolulu hendricks answered
flushing hotly i told you that there
seemed to be some trouble over some
irregularity in the ships papers that
was why i came ashore right away to
see you

  then you didnt see either to-days
or yesterdays newspapers

  i did not too busy-not inter-
ested anyway

  tell me exactly what happened
she said briefly sitting down

a t this hendricks glanced around
him in some perplexity i will
wont somebody disturb us here-the
people of the house

  she shook her head impatiently
please go on

  its not a long story i wonder
whether you could understand it

  if you mean can i understand
somebody wanting to kill captain
ames i may reply that i was his
wife-for three months

  it isnt like you to be bitter he


the blue book magazine

returned simply that is why i fan-
cied it would be hard to make you
comprehend just how things were and

believe my story

  tu believe you she answered
only please get ahead with it yes-
terday i was so stunned to hear that he
was dead actually gone forever that i
couldnt seem to think of anything else
now i must know more

  i didnt kill him hendricks said
slowly -though lie robbed me of my
schooner and took my money and made
me join him  never felt really ugly
towards him mrs-

  miss mathews she corrected
crisply

  and as a matter of fact no one
caused his death lie went on he
was paralyzed during the night  think
i found him dying in die morning he
was dead before either wilks or peter-
son knew he was sick

  how comes this report from hon-
olulu that captain ames was mur-
dered

  if you will listen ill tell you all
about it he answered earnestly as
i told you ames took my schooner
away from me by getting me into
dutch waters and then leaving me to
fight it out with a dutch gunboat i
was in forbidden seas and as i had
pearls and shell aboard which i couldnt
have proved came from unforbidden
regions i stood to be captured and im-
prisoned then ames came along and
offered to save me from prison if i
turned everything over to him i did
he left me broke with the choice of
starving or joining him i took the
easiest way out of a bad mess and went
with him though i gave him to under-
stand that i didnt consider him above
tlie level of a robber

  i beg your pardon said miss
mathews but where did you say you
came from

  i didnt say well some years
before that captain ames had had a
set-to with billy wilks wilks had a
hard name ran a hard ship and was
generally known as a bad customer
his quarrel with ames was over-it
was a personal affair

  miss mathews lifted her cloudless
eyes a woman of course

  mrs wilks hendricks muttered

  and captain wilks

  he went insane thats the truth
of the matter he had to give in it
was too much for him but ames
laughed at people who told him old
billy was dangerous and took him
along with him after he-he had pun-
ished him i used to think he wanted
wilks to start something with him-
was curious to know what the old fel-
low would do if he ever got his nerve
up again

  and what did he do

  you wont understand me when i
say that captain ames had the upper
hand of all of us there was nothing
wilks could do ames had completely
cowed him then there was peterson
you see always behind ames

  and peterson did i understand
that he is dead too 

lendrcks solemnly nodded ill

	 make it short this was ames
last voyage so he told me he said
several times that he was going to quit
the south seas but just before this
 oyage was done he takes sick and dies
telling me to take the schooner and the
pearls up to you

  you see the quandary i was in
ames was dead in a shanty and peter-
son and wilks a hard couple to handle
in the best of times didnt know it
wilks would fly right off the handle
when he learned his old enemy was
gone and peterson was plain brute
so i played ames against them fooled
them about his death got the body off
to the ship at night pretended the cap-
tain was sleepy and cross and got to
sea  figured that i could manage
some way of getting rid of peterson
and wilks then the schooner and the
money would be mine which it seemed
to me it rightfully was then id
have been free again but before i
could make my plans wilks runs
amuck sneaked down into the cabin
and thought he killed the skipper see
it looked like he-or some one else-
had really committed murder wilks
didnt know the man was already dead
nor did peterson i had no witnesses
to my story that ames died on the
island i knew that those two men
the temporary heir



would swear my life away so i let
wilks kill peterson

  then this wilks still thinks-
that he killed them both hen-
dricks suddenly caught himself up and
glanced apologetically at her excuse
me for speaking so plainly i told
you you wouldnt understand how
could you when you hadnt been on
that ship for months and years with
killer ames always making a faint
noise somewhere and what few stran-
gers you happened on grinned at you in
a superior manner i tell you that
when die old man thought hed done
murder i hadnt the heart to disabuse
him it sounds awful to you but-
that was the only mercy ever shown
on that craft

  mercy  she said wonderingly
mercy he repeated firmly papa
wilks had dreamed of the day when
hed do that and i-i was merciful and
didnt spoil his fun at the last and
after all what was it to me

  yes she breathed thats the
question everybody is asking will ask
what was it to you 

  nothing at all he answered i
see what you mean of course in a
way it worked out to my advantage
and you say you allowed this
crazy old man to murder mr peterson
the mate

with a comical gesture of despair
hendricks threw his hands palm
upward i said you wouldnt see how
it was how it all worked out as it
must he looked about the comfort-
able room of course you couldnt
here you are quite comfortable and
working i dare say for nice folks
ill warrant captain ames is pretty
much of a dream to you though you
say you were his wife how could you
understand papa wilks

  she leaned forward and he saw a
great gentleness in her expression the
formerly cold eyes were warm glow-
ing maybe i understand better than
you think she told him her chin on
her cupped palms poor man and
they are hunting for you high and low
as a murderer

	it sems kely they are he said
rising and i mustnt embarrass you

any more what would your employ-
ers say if they found you had a caller
who was liable to be hanged

  she laughed and rose with a nervous
movement which he could not interpret
for a little while she gazed out of the
window at the fog and said nothing
when she turned to him again he saw
a strange flush on her cheeks she
seemed younger

  you saved me she said quietly
the least i can do is to repay you by
saving you in turn

  i saved you he questioned with
incredulity in his tone

  yes i thought i was forever in
that mans power

i didnt kill him he said dully
you dont understand captain hen-
dricks listen to me a moment you
see this house all mine im rich
i have always been rich

  he glanced at her oddly i took
you for a maid here

 why

  pie puzzled over the answer and con-
ceded frankness i didnt see how
you could have met and married ames
if you were-well not a foolish but
good-looking servant captain ames
wasnt exactly the man who id fancy
would impress a woman like you

  she laughed shortly i accept the
criticism but ill explain i was barely
twenty when i met him he was at a
dinner at a friends house he was
introduced to me as an explorer a
man who had had tremendous adven-
tures all over the world you know
what a man he was i came under his
spell and ran away with him i came
back to this-to my own home he
was a fiend yet he didnt follow me
nor try to get me back it was his
way he simply ignored me as if we
had never been married it was his
devilish scheme of never setting me
free he disappeared i got a divorce
my marriage had been secret and no-
body except a very few knew of either
that or of the divorce that followed
so i was free again i thought what
a mistake i knew he was still alive
somewhere that some time he would
come in and look at me and tell me
to come back to him and i should
have gone to him captain he was
	the blue book magazine

that kind of a man i lived in horror

 was always thinking of him

  and twice he sent word both times
it was just as if he had gone overnight
and would be back in the afternoon
every day i trained myself to meet him
coldly and drive him from me but at
the bottom of my heart i felt helpless
then you came i didnt believe you
when you said he was dead i set it
down as another cruelty of his-what
he would call discipline

liendricks did not like her smile
 of self-derision you had better
not say any more he muttered sooth-
ingly

  but now i am free she went on
heedless of his distress i know you
spoke the truth he is dead he can
never walk in and stare at me out of
his cold eyes and make me his slave
again im free

  so extraordinary was her last ges-
ture that hendricks looked at her
appalled he felt impelled to say
you would have killed him vour-
self i

  if that could have bought my lib-
erty but then id have had to fear
death-for he would be there

  and yet you shed tears he said
heavily

  it is true she sobbed

  papa wilks was right then he
muttered he said some woman
will miss him  he turned his dis-
consolate face to the window his being
was stirred with a new and poignant
emotion he did not venture to glance
at her longer

  his attitude and the words he quoted
affected mrs ames strangely she
choked back her sobs and composed
herself then a new swift tenderness
enveloped her

  you saved me she said in a low
voice you knew nothing about me
but you came thousands of stormy
miles and risked your own liberty to
make sure that i got my rights you
brought me pearls not knowing that
you brought me a thing of infinitely
greater value my freedom from terror
ami dread and shame now-

  now im going away he said in
a strained tone

  no she protested quickly they
will catch you cant you understand
that there is a hue and cry for you
havent you told me yourself that yoii
have no witnesses and that wilks has
a terrible grudge to satisfy that he
will be wild to clear himself at your
charge there is only one thing that
can save you now

  hendricks rose and squared his
bulky shoulders now he knew what
this strange emotion was that held him
in thrall he must never cost any
woman so heavily as ames had cost
this one the killer was gone-utterly
gone from the life of this girl no
other man with impure hands and
stained conscience should take his place
even in the slightest degree he hen-
dricks would and must protect her
he looked calmly down into her splen-
did eyes and smiled

  you mustnt be mixed up with any
more of us he said as you say
you are free it wouldnt do for you
to be mixed up in this business-a lady
like you if they came here after me-
if anyone suspected that you were once
ames wife-it would be horrible

  where are you going she de-
manded

  down to the police-station he an-
swered

  but why what will you say

a gain he smiled confidently reas-
suringly why ill just tell em
i did kill ames and stand pat on that

  but you didnt kill him

  thats true he said just as true
as that papa wilks didnt either but
if id known you id have killed him
see we cant get away from that
can we

  and you will go down and be put
in jail and tried for a murder you didnt
commit and be hanged just because-
oh what nonsense

  it isnt nonsense he said with firm
quietness dont you know that you
will be mixed up in this pretty soon
unless they stop searching theyll
discover you were his wife which you
have kept a secret and theyll heap
scandal on you and make a witness out
of you now if they have me im the
only man that knows anything about
the temporary heir



the affair and i can keep a tight mouth
and you never say a word and some-
how ill pull through with nobody a
mite the worse no onell suspect you
of being connected with the matter or
with ames or me in any way

  she stared at him with wide eyes
scanning his face scrutinizing every
movement of his lips when he had
done she sighed i never thought i
would do it she said enigmatically
much less suppose id be glad to
do what he questioned

  a very simple thing she re-
sponded you say you arent known
here 

  only by one or two people
  would they-tell 

  hendricks recalled gottals nervous
figure and alert countenance he shook
his head no they wouldnt tell
then we shall get along famously
you must do exactly as i ask you this
afternoon its a simple little way out
of this matter i want your promise
that you will do precisely what i ask
you to and say exactly what i tell you
to

  will it mix you up in this he
demanded

  if you do what i say there wont
be any this or that by to-night i
want your promise captain

  he hesitated long wondering at the
reason of her eagerness to bind him
by his word of honor he decided that
she had some scheme that would not
matter either way her lovely pleading
deserved a reward he promised
honor bright

  wait here a moment she said
swiftly no-ill ring

nthe manservant appeared jud-
kins have the carriage around in
five minutes tell cicely to bring my
hat and coat and gloves

  hendricks surveyed his own coarse
clothes with a flickcr of amusement in
his eyes im hardly dressed to go
out with you

  you do look as if you were just
back from the uttermost seas so
much the better ah heres cicely
curiously he watched the delicate
fashion in which mrs ames garbed
herself for the street with the elderly

maids assistance it struck him as
altogether an experience to be allowed
to witness it then judkins entered
and performed his part in the ritual
he observed that the man was ex-
tremely grave and once or twice looked
at his mistress appealingly she re-
sponded by a faint kind smile

  you probably think me an awful
fool for taking you for your maid
he remarked as they went down to the
carriage

  how should you know she re-
turned you gave me a very good
excuse at the time

  ive had a chance to compare you
with the real article he said with a
certain grimness

  within half an hour the carriage had
threaded the foggy streets descended
into the lower city and rolled down
market street to a high office-building
hendricks followed his companion into
the lobby and was about to ask a ques-
tion when she laid one hand gently on
his arm

  remember she whispered you
have promised me

  in the elevator he pondered the
nature of their errand and gave it up
he resolved that he would take care
not to let her compromise herself

  they were received in the first room
of what seemed a large suite by a young
clerk who ushered them on and into a
large room occupied by a gray-haired
man it struck hendricks that he had
never before seen a man so completely
and distinctly elderly without being old
he jumped up quite youthfully hold-
ing out both hands to mrs ames

  im glad to see you susan he
said cordially i saw the story in the
papers this morning- he glanced at
hendricks and was silent

  about captain ames schooner
turning up without him she finished
putting up her veil yes thats what
brought me here i told the captain
here i would explain it you never
met captain ames did you judge
never he remarked with a second
careless glance at hendricks unless
i had helped you- again he stopped

  unless you had helped me get a
divorce youd never have known he
existed is what you intended to say


the blue book magazine

m

the captain here-you may as well not
beat about the bush judge

  as sure as my name is barrett
susan i always considered captain
ames as a myth the captain here
will excuse me for speaking so frankly
as i suppose he knows about it

is s mathews swallowed
flushed and cast down her eyes
he ought to she said slowly judge
barrett let me introduce captain
ames captain ames this is judge
barrett who-got our divorce

  the lawyer flushed too in anger
his shrewd eyes met hendricks with
a cold sharpness that could be felt
so youve turned up at last

  hendricks was about to respond with
an equally chill protest against being
identified wrongfully when he caught
his companions warning glance he
was silent the attorney sat down as
if feeling more secure that way and
there was absolutely no cordiality in his
tone as he said curtly well what is
the business for this morning susan
i see by the papers that there has
been a report that captain ames-my
husband-was killed down in the south
seas he tells me that the rumor is
due to the idle talk of a man who is
crazy

  evidently was the dry response
and so i told him we had better get
the matter settled right away so i
brought him here

  simple enough in one way judge
barrett replied scowling if hes
alive and well that is enough for
the government no corpusdclicti
naturally but-here he swung his
chair round so that he faced hen-
dricks-you will allow me to tell you
that i dont admire your fashion of
turning up here captain it looks to
me like a plain case of plotting to get
your former wife mixed up in your
affairs again understand me right
here she is absolutely divorced from
you i saw to that and you have no
claim on her on her sympathy or on
her fortune i honestly believe you
set the stage this way anil have worked
on her feelings there is just one con-
sideration which influences me to go
ahead and stop the governments

search for you and that is the fact that
this fine woman here hasnt a single
honorable soul in this world to look
after her interests unselfishly and im
going to still do my best for her even
to saving your worthless self from an
investigation which would doubtless
uncover more sins than you care to
have made public and for which you
might be held answerable

  iiis tirade was interrupted by a
husky please dont from mrs
ames the judge gave her one glance
of pity and continued looking hard at
hendricks

  miss mathews thank god the
court gave her back her own honest
name told me enough about you for
me to judge you you may impose on
poor wretches in the coral islands but
right here in san francisco your bluff
doesnt go -susan be quiet -now
ill tell you exactly how far ill g
ill tell the united states district at-
torney that you are alive and ive
seen you and that the report from hon-
olulu is a canard thatll make him
drop the matter instantly then ill
take up the formal complaint against
your schooner of violating port regula-
tions and settle that all this i do on
one single condition and that is that
you never breathe to a soul that you
ever had the honor of being this ladys
husband that you leave the city imme-
diately and that you dont ask her for
or accept from her a solitary red cent
do you understand

ryuring this speech delivered in a
low voice with an intensity of
utterance that seemed bom of an
almost uncontrollable inward emotion
hendricks had been first astounded
then wrathful then vigilant at the
end of it he made up his mind that he
couldnt at this late stage go back on
his word given to miss mathews he
must play up just as he had smiled
at killer ames so he now smiled at
judge barrett and as the killer had
felt thwarted so the lawyer for all his
deep disgust could not assume that he
had been wholly superior to the man
before him

  i cant discuss the matter with you
judge he said easily i promised
the temporary heir



miss mathews i would leave things in
her hands if she puts them in yours
all i can do is to see to it that you-
that i what i rasped the lawyer
breaking in at the slight pause hen-
dricks had allowed

  that you look after her interests
without bothering her too much about
your own was the calm conclusion
you impertinent scoundrel
hendricks laughed and was himself
amazed at the insolence in his own
voice easy to talk here in your own
office he remarked clerks in the
next room men outside the door and
a policeman within call when i talk
its nobody between me and the other
folks except myself so go ahead
hendricks smiled more broadly you
would cringe like any other whelp if
you were on a ships deck facing killer
ames

  barrett saw the point and undaunted
as he was knew he had gone too far
under the circumstances he nodded
with a scowl and rang his bell

  get the united states district at-
torneys office on the phone for me
he snapped to the clerk

  the ensuing conversation over the
wire was lengthy and several times
the lawyer was compelled to repeat
yes captain ames is in my office at
this moment presently he looked up
and asked hendricks gruffly who
brought the schooner into port 

  i did was the reply

 why that preposterous mystery
about your being on board  who was
the fellow who assumed to be the mas-
ter of the ship and later escaped from
the quarantine station

  myself i had important business
ashore and i wasnt going to be hin-
dered by a lot of fools

  h-m responded barrett and re-
sumed his conversation over the tele-
phone

  well thats settled he said at last
and turned to miss mathews now
susan youve done your part nobly
what next you know youre not
bound to this man in any way explicit
or implied within an hour the news-
papers will have the information that
ames is alive and in san francisco
you mustnt be mixed up in this not

at all so you leave him here and ill
see to it that he tells the reporters
exactly enough and no more you go
back home and thank your stars that
you did come to your senses and get a
divorce from him the judge rose
and stood over her hes not your
husband you understand that
susan 

   yes yes she said

  well now you just slip home
and sit quiet and forget him

there was a moments silence in
x which hendricks tried to catch her
eye and failed thats good advice
he said presently

  miss mathews paid no attention to
this she seemed to be in a profound
revery both men slowly fell into
easier attitudes as if she should be
allowed to take her time but when she
did speak barrett straightened up with
a curious expression on his face and
hendricks leaned forward

  you are concealing something from
me she said slowly i know it
judge the district attorney told you
something which you are keeping back
and you want to get rid of me right
away so that you can do something to
captain-ames here

  what could i possibly do susan
something she said firmly i am
sure of it you hate him and you
fancy you would be doing me a great
favor if you-if you punished him
she turned to hendricks with a trou-
bled glance ill stand by you she
said simply

  my heavens barrett burst out
listen susan do you want your name
in big type all over the first pages of
the newspapers with the story of your
childish elopement written in full
branding you as the divorced wife
of a-

  of a what she whispered tell
us judge what else is there

  the lawyers stern countenance grew
tender he leaned over and patted her
hand with a paternal air all right
susan  i guess im your oldest friend
and ill-i might as well tell you now
as later-for youll find it out this
man here is wanted for inurdcr

  but hes here to answer for him-
	the blue book magazine

self and- she began then a look of
horror came into her eyes oh she
gasped she forced herself to glance
at hendricks but you said you
didnt kill him she breathed

  mr peterson was killed the judge
said in a flat voice

  hendricks knew that he could no
longer play the part thrust ujon him
he bent over towards miss mathews
and said in a fresh strong voice id
tell him the whole thing

  her expression of terror stopped
him no she whispered let me
think

  she is right said the lawyer
calmly and i may as well tell you
captain ames that anything you may
say in this office will go straight to the
district attorney i thought you were
a myth and trusted never to hear of you
again now that you have put me in a
position forever to destroy your power
over this good woman here whose con-
fidence you have so grossly abused i
shall hesitate at nothing he shot his
cold steely glance at him at noth-
ing you arent my client and as
sure as i am before you ill see you
swing for the murdr of peterson
the judge is absolutely right
hendricks told her instantly nothing
you can do now

jviiss mathews rose her face
 a unclouded again her eyes once
more as cold and chill as a lake she
smiled serenely on her attorney oh
youre so wearisome at times she
remarked pulling down her veil the
captain and i are much obliged to you
im sure we come here for help and
you-she laughed lightly-you for-
get yourself -come captain

  barrett rose his face scarlet you
are not going out on the street with this
man he said curtly

  why not she demanded

  because within five minutes he will
be arrested as a murderer i am not
going to see you mixed up in this
but i am she responded and
now i have one thing to tell you my
dear friend-for i know you have been
and always will be my friend if you
have set the officers on my-yes on
my husbands track you will keep

them off for a while i came here
because i wanted advice and help 
made a terrible mistake you will re-
gret it to your dying day if you make
my poor error without remedy

  i am acting for your own good
he protested

  and  tell you she responded
quietly that i shall refuse to leave
this office until you assure me that you
will not betray captain-ames

  but they will get him anyway any-
where he may go to-even in your own
home susan-the last place i pray
heaven that he will go

  nobody knows him by sight she
returned nobody except you and a
few others-whom i have trusted-
know anything about my unhappy past
he is safe with me for a while-unless
you tell

 barrett swung on hendricks
havent you manhood enough to
stand on your own feet

  sure was the troubled answer
but miss mathews may insist

  i shall she said composedly
either he goes freely out of this place
with me and you promise not to betray
him or ill stay here and take the con-
sequences with him

  theyll arrest you too susan as an
accessory after the fact-at best as a
witness

  that is your lookout she re-
sponded dryly

  all right i give in the judge mut-
tered ill keep my hands off for-
until to-night then ill keep my word
to the district attorney and help the
government all that is in my power

  till to-night she repeated
thank you she held out her hand
and smiled the judge looked into her
cold eyes and grew white i am act-
ing for your own best interests susan
he said heavily and a thankless job
it is 

  ah your good conscience

ti-iey passed out and descended to
 the street without a word once
more in the carriage hendricks said
briefly if you will let me out in a
block or so ill see what i can do to
straighten this affair

  i made an awful mess of it didnt
the temporary heir



i she murmured i thought of
course that if captain ames were
found the rest would be simple i only
made things worse for now they will
be sure you killed peterson

  you did a very fine and gallant
thing he said quietly i know what
it must have cost you to claim the name
of ames even for an hour

   i never expected to do it she said
thoughtfully i had prayed that he
would die strange that i should have
tried to bring him to life again-in
you

   the judge is right in his advice and
his warning he went on he will
keep your confidence i know hell
never tell that you were in his office
with me hell simply say he refused
to accept me as a client i have till
to-night by that time you will know
nothing about me and never be dis-
turbed in any way so ill just leave
you now

  i knew you would insist on that it
is like you she was silent a little
while before going on  i like to know
that there is a man like you in the
world you have forgiven me for
criminal stupidity

  the finest compliment a woman
could pay a man he protested i
want you to remember that all my life
and in the next if there be one ill
never forget that you accepted me as
your husband for a little moment i
wish-

  he ceased abruptly and gazed gloom-
ily out into the fog miss mathews
presently laughed a little ill always
remember too it was so fine that die
name of ames could be carried by a
gentleman even if for a moment only-
it makes me a trifle happier im not
sorry for myself-sorry for you

  it was worth all that it will cost
me he returned simply and in the
future when you think of me just
recall that i bore the title of your hus-
band helplessly at first willingly at the
end

  but you arent-you cant-

  i must he said you have taken
the responsibility with judge barrett
he must never know you told a false-
hood he could not forgive you be-
cause he loves you and while no one

else in the world will know you and i
will always remember that i-that i
was glad to be captain ames if mat-
ters had been different-whats the
use he paused a moment then
stop the carriage and ill get out
here he finished huskily

  obediently she signaled the coach-
man and they drew up by the curb
hendricks moved out in the driving fog
and looked into the interior of the car-
riage at the woman who had turned her
face to his its good-by  he mur-
mured

  not yet she said hastily and
stepped out beside him before he
could protest she had directed the
coachman to go home without them

  well walk togedier a way she
said glancing about them what a
thick fog no one can ever see us
what is the use of taking risks he
demanded we are near your house
at any moment a friend may come on
us it may compromise you

  i dont care just now she said
coldly i must satisfy my conscience
before i let you go

  your conscience ought to be more
than dear youve suffered and en-
dured and finally suffered again-to
save a man you never saw in your life
before

  look at it sensibly she remarked
stepping along with a graceful free
movement i thought to repay you
for what you did for me and merely
made it impossible for you to escape
from a false charge

lie was about to answer when a fig-

	 ure came out of the mist came
toward them was almost past but
stopped short

  of all the people said gottal
lifting his hat miss mathews i was
just up to see you hendricks youve
got to vanish in an hour somebody
has lit a bonfire and youll be scorched
i cant understand it word has gone
cut that ames is in the city

  miss mathews lifted her misty veil
and glanced at the brokers nervous
face then you are acquainted with
captain hendricks she asked won-
dermgly

  known him for years said gottal


the blue book magazine

promptly saw him this morning
know his story-and yours too he
added that was why i went up to
see you miss mathews knowing
what i did i thought id warn you
never expected to find hendricks with
you i swear

  so you know about-my marriage
she said	

  never so surprised in my life said
the broker turning with them and
walking on but-well youre well
rid of him but some one has made
an awful stir-the federal building
hummed with the news that ames had
turned up now who the deuce-
its my fault mr gottal she inter-
posed with a detached air as if she
were chatting merely to pass the time
she briefly related the mornings events
when she concluded the broker
reached over and shook hands with
her

  it doesnt surprise me a bit he
announced just like you but well
admit the mess now for a way out
of it barrett is a chump should
never have called the district attorney
up wholly needless ought to have
seen into things first trust a lawyer
in love with his client to lose his head
judge barrett is not she said
warmly

  nonsense returned gottal were
all in love with you and you know it
all of us hendricks is i know and
hes seen you for the first time yes-
terday

  i believe that is true hendricks
remarked

  suddenly the woman between them
sobbed both men glanced at her in
alarm they saw her face contorted
with pain like a childs heard the chok-
ing in her throat

 whats the matter demanded
gottal hastily

  she shook her head then gave way
to her emotions im only a girl-and
so lonely she sobbed hiding her face
in her hands i want to do things
right-and i always do them wrong
and people pity me and say unkind
tilings i know tve done wrong ive
got captain hendricks into awful trou-
bie i-i dont know which way to
turn	j

  there are two of us here my dear
gottal said gently i can answer for
hendricks-known him for years
know my own heart turn to us
he took her shaking hands in his and
went on now youve done your part
youve made no mistake this day dear
girl youve done the finest act ever a
woman did-taken a name you hate to
save a man you-he bent far over her
bowed head-a man who loves you
i dont want to be loved  she whis-
pered desperately i want to be free-
to be my own master to do right things
all by myself

  good enough  the broker as-
sented promptly were both here
hendricks has an hour to get aboard
my schooner the orchis and beat to
sea or fall into the hands of the author-
ities with little chance of clearing him-
self i have a lifetime to spend doing
anything that will help you to gain your
own sweet ends this is no time for
us to argue which of us is it to be

  which she repeated looking up
in bewilderment i dont understand 
we understand perfectly gottal
returned youre the widow of ezra
ames and you fought to be free of
him comes george hendricks from
the south pacific with a message
murders been done somebody says
ames was killed hendricks is the
only man who knows all about it he
tells a story that no one will quite be-
lieve you have a story which sounds
fishy ezra ames two worst enemies
together who killed him  george
hendricks why because he loved
susan mathews and because ezra had
plenty of money and left it all in a will
to susan theres just one other
human being who knows all the parties
and thats henry gottal ship-broker
hes in love with susan mathews too
not in love with her like judge bar-
rett wholl kill and slay to win her but
really and honestly and humbly in love
with her-and willing to make her
choice easy

  i understand one thing  hen
dricks put in quietly that is that
miss mathews needs us both i must
get away she must never be connected
with ezra ames you must look to
that
the temporary heir	

  too late said gottal ames may
be dead but he still has a finger in the
pie she is mixed up in this affair
already thats why im here away
from my office i tried to get ahead
of the reporters

 judge barrett promised he
wouldnt say a word till to-night she
put in sadly

 its out of his hands was the
response he pulled a damp newspa-
per out of a pocket and pointed to the
great headlines on the first page
read that 

ljendricks took the sheet and
read aloud from it in a dull voice
that barely reached his companions
ears

    captain ezra ames is alive and in
  san francisco according to a report
  which reached the office of united
  states district attorney fenton to-day
  but the mystery surrounding the report
  of his murder in the south seas and
  the secret arrival of his schooner em-
  press at this port day before yesterday
  is deepened by the following dispatch
  from honolulu which brings into this
  strange affair the name of one of san
  franciscos most prominent heiresses
  honolulu- p- m bishop 
  company bankers this afternoon of-
  fered for probate the last will and
  testament of ezra ames late master
  of the schooner empress for whose
  murderer a world-wide search has been
  begun and w wilks held as a witness
  in the case the document dated two
  years ago bequeaths the entire estate to
  ames divorced wife susan mathews
  of san francisco bishop  company
  set the value of the property in their
  hands at a million and a half dollars

  thats an extra gottal remarked
inside of two hours the papers will
have columns with pictures and inter-
views

 you will get that fortune easily
enough anyway hendricks said
slowly if i go down and give myself
up as george hendricks i guess no
one will keep ames alive even in the
papers then you can claim your
money

  exactly the broker added bar-
rett will keep his mouth shut as soon
as he finds out you told him a fib
hendricks here takes what blame is
going you merely keep quiet allow the
affair to blow over and are a couple

of millions richer thats your choice
hendricks and allow people to guess
whether ames is really dead or not and
the courts keep the estate till seven
years pass or we fess up and i iden-
tify hendricks here identify you as the
widow and generally act as your agent
what could be simpler

  you havent made the matter clear
hendricks remarked his face very
sober he turned to the girl beside
him with a little gesture of reassurance
what gottal means is this your secret
is out and thats all there is to it but
there is no shame attached to it ames
has paid you the biggest of compli-
ments-left you his money after all
you simply take it as your right ames
dies right here-again i swear im
hendricks and gottal backs me up
my papers prove it ill tell my yam
and i get clear after a while there is
one thing for you to do gottal will
escort you home heres where i leave
you

  all right growled the broker
hendricks isnt wrong in that

   but hell go to jail she said

  or get away on my schooner
gottal remarked of course if he
does that you wont be able to prove
ames death and the legacy will be
tied up

  what do i want of the money
she cried i wouldnt touch it it
would be only another bond to tie me
down to what i hate captain hen-
dricks you must go away on the
schooner

  hush the broker warned hastily
and pointed to the big house looking up
in the fog there are reporters on
the steps already probably a few de-
tectives as well

they paused and then drew back to
the comer by common consent
there gottal said emphatically now
or never susan mathews if you go up
those steps youve got to tell your
story youve got to say whether
ames is alive or dead youve got to
explain whether hendricks is known to
you or not-youve got to talk and
what you say youve got to stick to till
your dying day

  if i say hes dead
	the blue book magazine

 theyll want to know how you
know it theyll demand information
as to the man who escaped from the
schooner over at quarantine and came
to see you but when youve told em
its all ended

  then you wont be able to save cap-
tain hendricks she assented hell
be caught and put in jail she raised
her head proudly and addressed hen-
dricks

  ive made my choice she said in a
low clear voice maybe im wrong
and maybe ill suffer
once more for doing it

but-will you take me
with you

 on the orchishe
stammered as - as
mrs ames

 have you nothing
better to offer me she
demanded in a whisper

no better name

 hendricks did not
move but stood in the
blowing fog as if
suddenly fallen into a
profound dream his face was that
of a man seeing an inward vision
undisturbed by the world about him
he stood at the climax of his adven-
turous life and the woman whose voice
called to him though silent knew that
the man before her was deciding for
them both as a man should in the
innermost heart of him now and then
a sound of expostulating voices reached
them the voices of men seeking their
lawful prey but unperturbed hen-
dricks thought to the end he lifted
his austere face and said we must

go

  it was as if destiny spoke at last
irrevocably and finally without a
word the three of them turned their
backs on the great house lifting its
stony walls to the veiled sky left be-
hind them the voices of men who would
burst their world to shards and pro-
ceeded down the long hill towards the

bay gottal sighed once or twice peer-
ing at the ground as if to rediscover
what he had lost he did not observe
the girls look of exaltation nor her
companions steady expression of reso-
lution yet some inner sense told him
when their groping hands clasped he
raised his eyes and smiled

vf id-a fternoon and the fog
v swirled over the coast flooding in
from sea before the wind as if to bury
all that man had built under its tide of
darkness out of the
shadow a schooner
swept plunging her high
bows under the foaming
crests of the long pacific
rollers for a moment she
remained visible to the
eyes of a little group on
the bridge of a tug whose
black streamer of smoke
flew against the low
gray clouds then the
vessel rose on a great
surge balanced an in-
stant and swept on and
into the invisible gottal shivered
drawing his dripping overcoat closer
about him the tug-boat master dropped
a husky remark

  so hendricks married an heiress
did he lucky dog

  heiress hardly hendricks did
all the inheriting himself i guess he
was only a temporary heir at first
ncrw hes permanently in possession of
all that killer ames left that was worth
a cent

  ames left a lot o money and pearls
too expostulated the other

  pearls dead pearls captain
and on the flying orchis susan
hendricks looking into her husbands
eyes laughed letting the pearls for
which killer ames had ravaged a
world drip through her careless fingers
to the deck-to roll back and forth
lusterless and forgotten in the great
light of love and life

 dissoiutfiotl

this is to notify all and sundry
that slim jim and cutaway
bill experts in flimflamming
brace games and diverse con
schemes have permanently dissolved
partnership what im saying is that
im plumb smackdab done with cut-
away and that im now looking for a
new sidekick in the laudable enterprise
of alienating the come-on from his
exchequer

  now get me straight on this im
not sore with cutaway personally
with just one exception no man could
buck on any of cutaways habits he
never has held out on me and the bulls
havent got pliers enough to twist a
snitch out of cutaway and nobody
could call him a fool hes got a fine
head for special and assorted graft
but you never can tell what his heart
will make him do and thats where
we busted up

  why after wed had a fine run of
suckers and had padded our clothes
with the long green until we were warm
enough to side doc cook on his next
jaunt after fiction material ive seen
cutaway slip a kid a ten-spot for a
yellow extra and if a curbstone pan-
handler would whine half like he meant
it my philanthropic partner would
strip off one of the yellow-backed boys
and part with it with a yawn and
although that sort of doings is some-
what out of my line i didnt make any
howl on cutaway so long as he confined
his donations to what you might call
the interest on our capital and didnt
dig into the principal my theory is
as i told cutaway you arent supposed
to have any heart when you get down
to your working capital and you
know yourself that im right about it

  you see cutaway hasnt been a
crook so very long-a half-dozen years


	the blue book magazine

or such a matter i tied in with him
four years ago and i know that then
he had to have a guide if he got off
the main streets of new york he had
been a cashier of a bank down in
georgia he told me and he got a lit-
tle tlip-like with other peoples coin
thats why they gave him a full and
complete course in overall-making
the stir sure didnt make much of a
hit with him for when he got out he was
pretty sore against most everybody and
everything with the exception that as
ive already told you hed have those
wild spells of giving the dough away

  cutaway wouldnt talk much about
the prison part of it but if you wanted
to find out why he blew up in the bank
all you had to do was to ask him why
he always wore a white carnation in
his buttonhole no matter what season
it was cutaway could always find a
flower for the lapel of his coat and i
guess he never has worn any kind of
coat but a cutaway thats where he
got his monaker

 ot long after he and i had drawn
  up articles of agreement prepara-
tory to our mutual dash into high
finance i put it up to cutaway about
that flower

  look here cutaway says i why
in the name of smoke do you want to
go around with that flower on you all
the time its such a dead give-away
that one of those ivory-domes from the
central station could track you with
that through a coney crowd if a rube
ever squealed on us it aint safe that
la-de-da coat of yours is tip enough
without that posy next thing i guess
youll be wanting to advertise our busi-
ness in the papers

  then i was sorry i had jacked him
up like that because the saddest look i
ever saw settled in his eyes he sort
of cleared his throat before he spoke

  slim says he i surely dont want
to be the cause of your getting the nip-
pers put on you but i hope youll
indulge me in this little habit of mine
i guess theres enough other guys
wearing flowers in their clothes to make
it fairly safe for me anyway this is
for the girls sake or rather-er-er-
her memory

  and with that he told me how a
human skunk of an opera-singer had
come down his way and stole the affec-
tions of the girl that cutaway was
engaged to i guess she must not have
been fitted for the cold weather up
east because they hadnt been up there
long before she contracted the t b
and then that dirty devil deserted her
she wrote cutaway about it after a
while telling him that she believed if
she could get out to colorado she might
pull through alive

  well cutaway had become reckless
after she left and hed thrown his
money to the winds but when the
girls letter came he just took from
the bank what he thought he needed
made a few cover-up entries expecting
to pay it back when he could and
caught the train for boston he gave
the girl his roll and she started for
trinidad while he was gone a bank-
examiner came round and when he
stepped off the train they put the cuffs
on him they gave him ten years and
while he was making overalls word
came to him that she had died

  slim says he with a kind of gulp
she pressed a white carnation into my
hand the night she promised to marry
me

co after that i never said anything
about the flower and we got along
harmonious until the break came that
i was telling you about cutaway and
me made a good pair i had had a fine
bit of schooling as a crook and cut-
away was as fine an actor as youd
expect to see in a two-dollar show just
give him the idea and hed put it over
in great shape im not much for looks
myself-skinny as a side-show freak
and no tailor on earth could make a
suit of clothes look right on me cut-
away would make beau brummel look
like a hobo not even a wise guy
would ever think of us working to-
gether and thats where we got the
rube

  but as i said thats all over now
and im looking for another partner
and i know the fellow i want to hook
up with too thats frisco dick the
cleverest crook that ever came from
the slope a man naturally endowed for
notice of dissolution



grafting and having had the unsur-
passed advantage of a postgraduate
course among the juarez gang and if
theres a game those boys dont know
nobody has sprung it yet

  ive looked up frisco dicks record
during the past few days and hes the
guy for me he not only has a bunch
of flossy little stunts of his own devis-
ing but he can let the other fellow
name the game and then beat him at
his own lay i know genius when i
see it and frisco dicks got it he
may be in new york right now but
whether he is or not im going to stay
on his trail until i find him me for
him but i want to make it perfectly
clear why ive quit cutaway

  we had tried all sorts of con games
and we got results too but it was my
idea that we ought to specialize on one
trick and stick to it simplicity is the
thing you are looking for in business
methods you want to work out some-
thing that a rubes head can follow or
nearly follow if you put too much
paint on the fly the trout wont strike
given a neat naughty little scheme
that appeals to a rubes greed some-
thing with a get-rich-quick twist to it
especially if its based on the ponies
and youll get your game nine shots out
of ten thats my idea and cutaway
agreed with me and we were going
good when the blow-up came

it was sunday morning the latter part
 of december and i was strolling
around on sixth avenue and the cross-
streets along in the thirties sunday
mornings a mighty good time to work
a trick on the wayfaring rube what-
ever suspicions he may have any other
time he seems to leave off then

  cutting across to fifth avenue i
saw a tall guy standing with his back
to me looking up at the buildings on
the opposite side just the once-over
was enough to tell me that he was new
to the big burg when i came along-
side of him i saw that his face was sort
of tan-and-red like you see on all folks
from the plains country he was wear-
ing a boad-brimmed black hat and his
fob was a pair of gold cattle-homs

  you couldnt ask for better game
than a cattleman from the southwest

come to town to have his little fling and
always with a roll big enough to stop a
busted hydrant with theyre out for
something different and they expect to
pay for it

  beg pardon says i but can you
tell me the name of that building i
pointed toward the knickerbocker
trust building

  nope says he with an easy drawl
looks like it migbt be the courthouse
though

  that was all i wanted i always
make it a point to be sure what im
doing when i start anything

  ah says i then youre a stranger
in little old new york the same as
me

  yep says he never had time to
leave the ranch before had to come
this time though business or no busi-
ness

  the more i looked at that affidavit
face of his the better he looked to me
his clothes were wrinkly like he had
slept in them instead of taking a pull-
man i saw that he had on boots in-
stead of shoes and he was wearing a
black string tie as an unusual conces-
sion to the requirements of city folks
i knew his kind everywhere you poke
them your finger hits a bulging wallet

  same way here says i just run
up to philadelphia on a little business
for the old man and i thought i
wouldnt go back without hitting a few
spots in new york collected a big
overdue account down in philly so the
old man cant kick if im a little reck-
less with spending money on the trip
where you from

  down in texas says he if id
had ten guesses all of them wouli have
been texas

  that so says i im from down
that way myself i live in parsons
kansas old man runs a big store
there dont think much of me though
gives me a little spending money-ive
ot two thousand in the bank now-
ut he thinks im too wild yet to be
taken into the business maybe hes
right i guess i am a little gay but
believe me whenever im dead i want
em to bury me aint that right 

  you bet says he and laughed

  by the way says i ive just


the blue book magazine

started out on the avenue to find sena-
tor clarks home they say that is
one bird of a place ive read in the
papers about it-cost four million and
got pictures and things in it from all
over the world open to the public
too they say dont have em like that
down our way do they thought id
like to see it so  can tell em about it
down in parsons gee their eyesll
bulge out on the stems join me

  dont care if i do he drawls care-
less-like

i started up the
avenue and after
a while  asked a bull
how far out the clark
place was it was
eleven oclock and the
silk-hat swells were
thick as flies around a
bowl of sugar

  these boys with the
shiny lids wouldnt last
long down our way
would they says i

  i guess not says he
and his face wrinkled up on one side

  thompsons my name says i
-just plain old john henry thomp-
son call me john thats the way i
am-plain as an old shoe

  williams is mine says he -rich-
ard williams to be exact

  well dick says i you and i both
have got plain handles good enough
for us though eh

   so i rattled on and i could tell i was
getting closer to him all the time al-
though he was the kind of fellow that
dont talk much about his own affairs
to everybody he acted like he was
worried about something too i told
him how that morning i had pretty
near made up my mind to knock the
block off the waiter who had turned up
his nose and swept onto the floor a
dime tip i had left by my plate i could
tell that kind of talk made a hit with
williams

  by the time we reached the plaza
hotel williams was liking me fine i
asked a messenger-kid what building
the plaza was and williams said hed
like to take a look inside

  both of us said wed had late break-

fast but  took williams into one of
the eating-rooms and asked him to have
a sandwich with me anyway while
we were eating i said

  by the way wait here a minute for
me i want to go find a paper from
down our way they ought to have it at
this swell dump

  then i got on the phone and talked
to cutaway at the news-stand i got
a copy of the kansas city star

  didnt have a copy of the parsons
herald says i when i got back so i
had to take this

   paid for the lunch
and when we got up
williams said hed
buy the cigars the
girl at the stand pulled
some twenty-five-cent
straights williams was
going to pay for two
when i said

  none of that gotrox
stuff girlie we dont
want to go beyond ten-
centers

yye walked out the door fronting on
 central park and continued our
walk along the avenue we hadnt
gone more than three or four blocks
when i squeezed williams arm and
pointed toward a man standing on the
curbing he was wearing a cutaway
coat with a white carnation in his but-
tonhole

  do you see that guy says i in a
whisper i know that bird now see
if i dont

  we drew up alongside of cutaway
and i says

  my friend havent i met you
before

  cutaway gave me the icy up-and-
down and back again

  not to the best of my knowledge
and belief says he

  oh yes you have says i werent
you down in parsons kansas last sum-
mer a year ago and didnt you win a
hundred thousand dollars in a pool-
room there on the sunstar sweepstakes
in juarez

  you evidently have me confused
with some one else says cutaway
ill bet he looked just like that when

he used to turn down a fellows request
for a loan at the bank

  aw come on says i i was right
there at the tinfe you did it when
you cleaned up everybody said theyd
never seen you before and we couldnt
find where you come from the pro-
prietor of the elite hotel offered to
sell out and go with you now aint i
right 

  since youve got the dope on me
straight says cutaway with a grin
i guess i might as well own up the
com but say you fellows are not
reporters are you

  forget it says i my friend here
dick and i are just out for a good
time we live down parsons way
say you havent got anything good you
could give us to-day have you
cutaway reached in his inside pocket
and took out his wallet he tried to
hand a twenty-dollar bill to me and
one to williams

  you got me wrong friend says i
were not trying to panhandle you
and we dont want your money what
i was asking is have you got any good
tips on the races to-day i dont know
what your system is but id back your
guesses for a little one

  cutaway looked at his watch some
time before he spoke

  well he says you two look like
sociable fellows so ill tell you yes
ive got the dope on juarez for to-day
the races are just about to begin there
-their time is faster than new york
time you know i was just starting
round the corner to the commission
club going to lay a couple of thou-
sand on the first race-sea lion at
four to one if you want in on that
all right

rutaway took a telegram out of
his pocket he showed it to wil-
liams and me holding his thumb over
his name up in the comer of the mes-
sage was written rush it was all in
cipher but the names sea lion myrtle
maid autumn breeze and dipper were
clear enough

  here says i take this twenty and
lay it on sea lion i know its a
pikers bet but racing is out of my
line

  cutaway took my money and placed
it with a handful of bills of his own
neither of us said anything to wil-
liams about putting up any money
cutaway walked across the street diag-
onally and disappeared around the
comer of one of the big houses of
millionaires row

  if we win i told williams ill
divide with you i just want a little
sport thats all

  pretty soon cutaway was back

  did we win i asks fairly jump-
ing up and down with what williams
was to take for excitement

  not so fast says cutaway laying
his finger on his lips i just put up
the money the race is being run now
i didnt want to stay over there among
all those sports until my face became
common to them

  he looked at his watch and says
ill be going it ought to be over
now

  i noticed that williams fidgeted a
good deal where he and i were sitting
on an iron bench up against the park
wall there are mighty few of them
that can see easy money coming in
without getting the fever

 when cutaway came back he drew
out his swollen wallet and coolly
skinned off a hundred dollars

  heres yours he says -eighty
dollars winnings and your twenty
back it made my hand quiver as i
took it

  take half of this i says to wil-
liams holding out the money he
didnt want to take it but i stuck it in
his pocket anyway good cigar money
while youre here in new york eh
cutaway made as if he were going
to leave us

  gee says i this is great when
is the next one to come off 

  right now pretty quick says cut-
away ive got to be going to get my
money up its myrtle maid-six to
one im going to put up three thou-
sand on her

  look here says i do you think
shell win

  if i didnt i wouldnt put up my
money on her im not a blamed fool
whats more i dont think shell win
i know it


the blue book magazine

  well then says i im going to
put up five hundred thats all ive
got with me

  hold on my friend says cutaway
to me now if you want to bet on
this race you can help me you see
i dont want to go over there too much
those rich guys will get my number
if you will go over and put up my
money with yours ill let you in on
this

  youre on says i i took out my
five hundred and cutaway laid a wad
of greenbacks in my hand then he
took a printed card out of his pocket
up in the corner were the names of
james r keene and august belmont
across the top in big type was the

manhattan commission club

  here says he just go to the first
door round that corner rap three
times and the porter will open up
then you hold the card just so with
your thumb lying along the edge and
the doorman wifi take hold the same
way on the other side of the card
then you just walk right upstairs
youll make it all right from there
on

  i made him show me all over again
and then i started

  wait a minute says williams
ill go you five hundred on that my-
self if youll let me

  they cant keep out of it long i took
his money and walked across the street

i knew what was happening while i
was gone cutaway pulled a fake
newspaper-clipping about that parsons
clean-up and explained that he was in
with a syndicate that bet on sure things
he told how the whole juarez bunch
are crooked and how everybody is
fixed from jockey to judges so that
having been given in advance the win-
ners of the day there was no way on
earth for him to lose and he said
that the syndicate cleaned up by having
agents like him to go about over the
country and hit the fancy betting-joints
you couldnt find a flaw in his spiel
anywhere

 when i came back cutaway and
williams were talking says cutaway
to me

  you got the money up all right did

you 

  now wait a minute says i and
i hope you dont get sore with me but
the truth is  didnt find the right door
at first and i got there too late to get
the bet down they were cashing in
just as i stepped up myrtle maid
won all right

  you would have thought cutaway
was going to bust wide open he looked
so mad but then i told you he was
some actor

  you idiot he roars at me i
thought i could trust you and now
what have you done youve got me
in bad with my syndicate i have to
bet on the horses they tell me and tum
in their part of my winnings youve
fixed me all right give me my
money and get away from here

  say friend says i i couldnt
help it honest i couldnt if youll
just give me another chance-

  another chance youve spoiled
this one and you want to ball up an-
other one do you not on your life

  all the time cutaway and i were
talking williams was just listening and
walking back and forth finally he
says

  if theres to be another one i wish
youd give my friend another chance
i know he feels as bad about it as
either of us i dont think hed lummix
up the next one

  cutaway scowled and pulled his
watch again then he says to me
all right ill try you on this last
one its dipper-the killing of the
day a ten-to-one shot and mind you
youd better get it right this time
then williams said he would put up
a thousand-all he had on him but
twenty-five dollars he declared cut-
away said he would put up ten thou-
sand even then i chimed in

  ive got a check on a philadelphia
bank for twenty-five hundred will
they let me put up a check  i says
sure says cutaway only hurry

up

  so i placed the check against the
park wall and endorsed it while i
was doing this cutaway instinctively
stuck all of our money into his pocket
but williams didnt seem to notice this
notice of dissolution



and to tell the truth i didnt either at
the time

 ow ill have to explain a little

	 about what cutaway and i were
working toward

  it was our custom when we had the
sucker putting up his last bone to work
in the check stunt you see the horse
wins but when i go back for our win-
nings they tell me that because theyve
lately taken in so much in bad checks
without casting any doubt on the one
i have up they must wait for it to go
through the banks before they can
settle with me

  thats the story im to bring back to
cutaway and the rube then cut-
away asks about the check and i ex-
plain its made out to the old mans
company and that i just signed it for
him cutaway goes up in tlie air and
says ive committed forgery and that
well all be pinched unless we can get
together the money at once to cover the
check knowing that the rube has put
up his pile just as have the rest of us
then the rube gets scared and beats it
and cutaway and i divide

yythen i came back over after i
 was supposed to have put up the
money i found cutaway sitting on the
bench with tears in his eyes

  wheres the rube says i quick
enough

  hes gone says cutaway sit
down

  gone gone where

  back to texas says cutaway
just be easy and ill tell you about it
you see while you were gone that
fellow told me his story a scoundrel
from new york lured his girl away
from her home in san antonio and
hes scouring the continent for her he
knows that the mean devil onlv pre-
tended to marry her and he guesses
shes somewhere here

  he says that hes going to find

her if it takes his lifetime to do it and
then hes going to find the scoundrel
who ruined her and kill him he said
he never has bet on a horse-race before
and that he wouldnt have done it now
only he needed more money to go after
that pair with and when he said
that i turned over to him every cent i
had on me and told him how we had
been framing up on him he certainly
was grateful

  you could have knocked me down
with a straw

  you gave him back his money
not only so says cutaway quiedy
but ive just told you that i gave him
yours and mine too i tell you he
needed it and we can get some more
some day

inuring the next week i didnt
want to see cutaway-i was afraid
i would do him violence around at
murphys place-muiphy knows every
crook in the country-i asked certain
questions and received some real en-
lightenment thats when i decided to
leave cutaway

  i found him one night drinking high-
balls upstairs in mooneys he was
sitting off by himself in a corner

  cutaway says i what was the
name of that guy you gave up the
dough to

why williams wasnt it thats

in the rue vignon up back of the
madeleine a small wrought-iron
hanging sign projects over the nar-
row entrance of a restaurant which
has become famous during the last few
years-particularly since the beginning
of the war the quaint old french
letters inform passers-by that it is the
cafe des trois gascons-the name
having come down from a small
hostelry in the fields outside the walls
of old paris in the fifteenth century
inside after one has gone some twenty
paces and passed the cage where the
stout proprietress sits the passage
opens into a large room with a mezza-
nine balcony lighted during the day by
a skylight over the center to-day the
place is a popular rendezvous for
officers on weekly furlough from the
trenches-and for war correspond-
ents government officials and the
sprinkling of outside civilians who are

permitted by the police to remain in
paris for legitimate purposes

  the waiters who formerly knew and
were known to most of the patrons are
in shallow graves back of the firing-
line or in the trenches around verdun
their places are filled in the cafe des
trois gascons by girls in short black
skirts white aprons and caps-girls
between eighteen and twenty-five who
possess the wit to be entertaining as
they serve and do not underestimate
the responsibility which rests upon
every woman of france to provide the
nation with its soldiers of the future

  at the table in a rear comer one
evening were four officers who had
come down from the front on a weeks
furlough-three of them irish and the
other a gordon highlander they
were in high spirits-making the most
of their brief respite from the soul-
deadening trench-li fe they joked with


free lances in diploimacy



marie their waitress and exchanged
anecdotes of various engagements and
discussed the entertainments to be seen
in paris with the absorbing interest
of men who do not know whether
to-nights comedy or opera may be their
last presently two more irish officers
came in with three ladies and a well-
known member of the chamber-seat-
ing themselves at a near-by table and
bowing to the group in the corner as
marie came in from the kitchen with a
pate and four bocks

  for a moment or two she stood by
the corner table easily holding her own
in the duel of repartee then she moved
on to take the order of a couple who
had just entered the room subcon-
sciously however she was noticing a
subtle change in the talk among the
irish officers as soon as she left them
the voices of at least two dropped to a
more confidential tone they appeared
to be discussing something which they
preferred not having overheard

  now for one memorable year marie
had lived in london as the assistant of
a bond street modiste and had picked
up enough english to follow any ordi-
nary conversation by occasional
words that reached her from the table
in the corner she sensed the fact that
the officers were referring to some
undertaking in which a number of their
fellow countrymen were interested-
some approaching day upon which cer-
tain plans would be carried out with the
cooperation of all

  there was nothing said which indi-
cated a treasonable element in whatever
it was they were planning in fact it
was far more likely to be some pre-
liminary concentration for a summer
offensive against the german lines
after some consideration she decided
that what little she had overheard could
have no other application and almost
forgot the intensely patriotic curiosity
which prompted her to listen so
closely-almost but not entirely after
a while passing the table of the
deputy henri couramont she noticed
that he was talking in much the same
confidential manner to one of the offi-
cers at his table-which also bore out
the supposition of an impending army
campaign

when couramont and his party left
vv the trois gascons the comer
group of irish officers were not long
after them three hours later deputy
couramont came walking along through
the arcades of the rue de rivoli with
captain tim delaney who had fol-
lowed him from the cafe as they
reached the rue castiglione the light
from an arc-lamp shone down upon
their faces with a bluish-green reflec-
tion that distinctly revealed every line
and feature to a tall man in evening
clothes-sir francis lammerford of
the english diplomatic service-who
was coming down the other arcade
from the place vendome at first he
noticed them in merely a casual way
as they stopped for a second or two
before crossing to the hotel continen-
tal  then a fleeting expression upon the
deputys face held his attention suffi-
ciently to make him study the man
closely he recognized the two men in
the second glance but the expression
he had caught reminded him of some
one who was not couramont some man
whom he couldnt remember to have
seen for years a person whose name
and identity escaped him spur his
memory as he might

  lammerfords mind was still occu-
pied with the evasive resemblance when
lie dropped in at the cafe sylvain and
found there gaston de marais of the
corps diplomatique in the years pre-
ceding the war de marais and sir
francis lammerford had been diplo-
matic adversaries but each man re-
spected the others ability aud their
interests were now identical at least
until the final readjustment of euro-
pean boundary lines as sir francis
had been in russia for nine or ten
months-had been twice reported
dead-the frenchman was genuinely
pleased to see him

  my dear friend is it really thou
come this is a happy meeting we
will exchange experiences-with cham-
pagne to stimulate the memory-eh 

  for a while they chattel of various
campaigns and the political undercur-
rents which more than the taking or
losing of trenches moved the warring
nations this way and that toward the
final showdown upon which a return


the blue book magazine

to peaceful life was possible after
a while lammerford casually men-
tioned having seen the deputy henri
couramont

  the man appears to be gaining in
political strength-if im a judge of
stray gossip and the manner of people
toward him

  ah-ouif couramonts leaders in
le courier du matin have been most
daring he has fought seven duels in
consequence he is a man to be reck-
oned with and the cabinet are well
aware of the fact-they even men-
tion him for the posies et telegraphes
portfolio

  lets see he was from the cote
dor wasnt he-originally

  thought it was llaut-saone-
pretty well over toward the rhine
valley at that was he not running a
small weekly sheet at belfort before
he came to paris-eighteen years ago
it is said he gets his extreme hatred of
the boche from having lived within a
stones throw of him so long

  seems pretty thick with the english
and irish officers

  ah that makes itself to be under-
stood my friend officers are not
permitted to say too much you know-
but one may smile affirmatively when
another makes a tentative statement
which is known to be true one hears
that much of couramonts accurate
information concerning matters at the
front comes from his frequent dejeu-
ners with people of that sort and
besides-one hears that his mother
was the daughter of an irish baronet
which makes the accounting for his
excellent english-as his early years on
the german border gave him german
which is practically without accent

j a mm er fords mind was flash-
ing from one half-remembered face
to another-groping considering fitting
together the various points in this
gossip concerning the deputy and try-
ing to construct inferences that would
prove up

  theres no question as to his patri-
otism i suppose no chance of his
having imbibed prussian ideas from
having lived so long in close touch with
them 

  pouf you should hear him speak
of the boche my friend he spent a
day last month in the trenches at
verdun-and sat in a puddle of water
for hours potting at every german
head he could see one hears that he
got two of them-the man is an artist
with rifle or pistol

  humph from what you say de
marais the man appears to be one of
those tried and proved individuals to
whom no possible suspicion can attach
eh 

  it makes itself obvious that ones
actions influence the opinions of
others-more than the spoken word
the man has given proof at the risk of
his life-and more than once is it
that you have something in mind con-
cerning this couramont man ami

 notheres nothing upon

which i could base a fragment of suspi-
cion against him only-when you
mentioned his early years upon the
german border i thought of the many
instances which show the extent to
which a prussian will risk his life un-
hesitatingly if at some crucial moment
he may find himself in position to do
the one vitally important thing for his
government-the one thing impossible
were he known to be german with
couramont as you say one has proofs
enough as to where his sympathies he-
and lies half english or irish so that
removes even the possibility of any
german taint in his blood ncst ce pas
well-yawning slightly-ive had
but six hours sleep in two days i shall
have to make some of it up you must
tell me where i may find you most
frequently-i may be in paris for a
week or so

espite de marais information
however lammerford was by ao
means wholly reassured concerning
couramont and when he studied a
half-tone portrait of couramont which
appeared in one of the popular illus-
trated papers lammerford felt again
that haunting impression that the
deputy was not what he seemed-was
convinced that he had at some previous
time in some other environment seen
the face that looked out at him from
the page of the journal
free lances in diplomacy



  sir francis knew that couramonts
early life was a matter of little interest
to him if it had been passed in france
if by any chance however it should
prove that the mans previous life had
been spent in germany or austria
ah here was the short-cut in his
theoretic reasoning if a man achieves
prominence in any german city its a
foregone conclusion that he will spend
more or less time in berlin if his face
and personality stand
out from the mass in
berlin even for a brief
period it is morally
certain that one of
three or four great
illustrated weeklies will
reproduce h i s first
obtainable photograph

and the greatest of
these weeklies in size
and popularity is the
illustrirte zeitung

  at ten next morning
therefore l a m m e r -
ford walked down to
the old palais mazarin
and made out a bulle-
tin of the volumes he
wanted in the biblio-
theque nationale he
had taken with him
the copy of le monde iuustre in which
couramonts portrait appeared-enter-
ing it upon his bulletin as personal
property which he might afterward
carry out of the building

  for over an hour lammerford
rapidly turned page after page of the
big volumes-dismissing each half-
tone portrait with a single glance as
he passed it then-in the second
volume-his hand paused at the head
of a paragraph recording a scandal
which had been the talk of berlin
society for a week or more was the
picture of a young captain in one of the
uhlan regiments hauptman heinrich
schmaltz had by his good manners and
soldierly appearance attracted the
attention of the imperial family-being
given a very desirable command at the
schloss after a few months he was
frequently seen with a handsome vien-
nese countess who had been five years
married but detested her husband the

count heard rumors and came to ber-
lin  there was a duel in which the count
was killed captain schmaltz was sent
to america on a mission promptly
arranged with the wilhelmstrasse-
and the countess disappeared at the
same time

  the incident and the gossip came
back to lammerford as he read the
paragraph so far as he knew berlin
never heard of the young captain again

yet the expression he
had noticed upon
couramonts face in
the glare of the arc-
lamp had been identical
with the one caught in
a glimpse of captain
schmaltz as he stood
under one of the
arched entrances of the
schloss in berlin
nineteen years before
-with the light from
one of the park lamps
falling upon his head
and sharply outlining it
against the deep
shadow under the arch
behind him

  lammerford placed
the two half-tones side
by side that of the
young captain showed merely a small
mustache while the deputy wore a thin
van dyck but the lines of the face
the prominent chin and forehead the
eyes the whole expression were unmis-
takable the popular member of the
french chamber-supposed bitterly to
detest everything german-was in
fact heinrich schmaltz formerly cap-
tain in a berlin regiment of uhlans
and in the service of the wilhelmstrasse
at the time he disappeared

  for perhaps the thousandth time in
his diplomatic career sir francis
knew that his sense of intuition had
been vindicated-that what seemed an
absurdly groundless suspicion had been
based upon that inner consciousness
of his which automatically recorded
impressions and stored them up for
future use making a memorandum of
the volume and page-numbers in the
big german weekly he left the library
and went back to his apartment

a remarkable
record

  since the affair of the kiel
  maneuvers published in the
  march  blue book
  clarence herbert news stories of
  the free lances in diplomacy
  have appeared practically without
  interruption in the blue

  ter for mr new has developed a

the blue book magazine

that afternoon sir francis went
down to the isle de la citie and
called upon his old acquaintance
lepine at the prefecture without
implying that he was interested in one
more than others he asked for brief
resumes of the careers of certain
french politicians-including the cabi-
net ministers two senators and three
deputies knowing sir francis lam-
merford to be associated with the brit-
ish foreign office it was-to monsieur
lepine-a perfectly natural inquiry
since the conference of the allies at
which it was agreed that they should
act in concert during the remainder of
the war each of the chancelleries has
been vitally interested in the member-
ship of the other governments a
rather unusual harmony prevailed-but
under the surface there was necessarily
a close observation of opinions and
actions among government officials
everywhere in order that anything
which seemed to threaten this harmony
might be promptly dealt with

  with the vast amount of minute
information at his disposal lepine was
able to give an accurate account of what
each mans private life had been as
well as that recorded in the daily prints
if anything lammerford seemed less
interested in henri couramonts biog-
raphy than those of more prominent
men-the prefect couldnt decide
whether his friends request had been
actually what it appeared on the sur-
face or not but lammerford left the
boulevard du palais with data concern-
ing the deputy which gave him more
than one clue as to where he might look
for evidence of nefarious activities
for one thing he learned that mile
obregon of the folies bergere-said
to be couramonts bicn ainise-was an
intimate friend of mrs boyle fitz-
patrick wife of a captain in one of the
irish regiments and that the four
dined frequently with other officers and
their wives at the cafe des trois
gascons in the rue vignon

  lammerford had taken a table at the
trois gascons at the rear of the larger
room and was finishing his soup when
they arrived that evening while
etudying the party in casual glances he
was conscious that his pretty waitress

looked at him rather intently as she
brought in his meat-course the only
other diners in their vicinity were a
group of irish officers-too much occu-
pied with their own conversation to
overhear anything said in guarded
tones after glancing at them to esti-
mate how far her voice might carry
she leaned over the handsome english-
man-arranging his dishes

  msieu does not then remember
me behold-i am that marie la-
tour whom les betes apaches were
dragging up the rue pierre sarazin
from the boul mich one night three
years ago-when le bon msieu anglais
knocked them down and shot the one
who drew a knife

  ma foi one has the great pleasure
in seeing thee again o fittef in the
darkness of little streets it makes itself
very difficult to see a face distinctly
one remembers we had a bock in one
of the boul mich cafes to restore thy
nerfs and that one accompanied thee to
thy apartment for safety afterward
my affairs made it necessary that i
should depart from paris next morn-
ing-so i had but the little souvenir of
cerise ribbon to remind me of the
adventure you have now a husband-
ouir

  ah non-msieu for two months
only he was killed at the mame
for a year before i was in your big
foggy london-where one acquires the
anglais with much labor then i
returned before the war msieu is
perhaps of the corps diplomatique

  and why think you that m a
belle

  because one observes that msieu
came out of the prefecture this after-
noon and spoke to msieu de marais
on the pont neuf msieu has the
bearing of tin soldat yet he is never in
uniform one observes little things in
a place like this concerning which it is
desirable to speak with some one who
is of the government oui

  lammerford was apparently paying
more attention to his dinner than to the
pretty waitress par exemplef he
inquired

  behold the irish officers at the
comer table they talk of the
trenches-the opera the amusements
free lances in diplomacy	

of paris-when one is within hearing
the moment one is at a little distance
they mumble anisng themselves of other
matters

  possibly orders for a new offen-
sive-which must not be known
regimental gossip of their own-
affairs of the army in general ma
fille

  out-oid-one thinks of all those
things they do not altogether explain
par exemple m couramont the dep-
uty dines frequently with some of their
party and ladies-as he does this
evening those at each table bow to
the others-also to people in different
arts of the cabaret when they leave
ere most of the irish officers go by
different streets to the apartment of
m le capitaine fitzpatrick-where
they play at cards until midnight m
couramont i have three times seen
there with them while they play it is
evident they discuss other matters of
great importance me-i am chcz moi
an cinqtdeme in the rear of that house
which is on the other street from my
window one looks into those of m le
capitaine one floor below across the
court upon four evenings of the
week i leave les trois gascons at six
oclock upon the other three i am here
earlier and leave before the dinner
h-m-m-you have not fear of me
via fille

  but no msieule chevalier

pourquoi it is that you rescued me
that time it is that you are gentil-
homtnel

  peste it is not that which i meant
you believe that me i have the love
of france the love of my england
that i despise and am ever suspicious
of le boche

  ah oui old msieu ma foi-
it is of a certainty-that

  trbs bien then-you will permit
that i accompany thee to thy apart-
ment when thou leavest-at ten
oclock 

  but certainly msieu it is my
wish me-i am but a girl who knows
little of state affairs-mais tine fille de
prance de tout temps perhaps i am
foolish that i watch the officers so
closely and suspect-ah one does not
know what to suspect in such times

at least one does no harm to be
alert

i ater at a comer three blocks
away marie met sir francis and
they rode in a taxi to her apartment
as she had her own keys there was no
occasion to disturb the concierge they
climbed the five flights of stairs in
silence and bolted her outer door after
entering the suite in order that no
attention might be directed their way
from the apartment across the court
she didnt turn on a single electric
motioning him to an easy chair by the
window she perched herself upon the
broad arm of it while he drew from
his pocket a pair of powerful opera-
glasses	 

  the night had proved warmer than
usual and so all three windows of
captain fitzpatricks apartment were
open through a passage they could
see the card-players in a further salon
but men and women drifted back to the
living-room at the rear from time to
time examining pictures upon die wall
books and curios upon die table or
refreshing themselves from a cellaret
in one corner as lammerford focused
his opera-glasses a group of three were
examining the paintings and one called
to fitzpatrick in the other room

   i say old chap is this the picture
you did on the meuse

  aye-an i can assure you ive
painted under more favorable condi-
tions  we had a bomb-proof dug from
clay in front of the trench with a floor
of misfit planking about six indies off
the ground it was right enough in
good weather-but after a days rain
our feet were always in the water to
get a decent light i had my easel stuck
up at the trench-opening-had a nar-
row escape once or twice before i
finished the picture ysee that bit of
a patch on the canvas where the color
is laid on uiick with a palette-knife
that was done by a fragment of
shrapnel which missed my forehead by
a quarter of an inch an made an awful
hole in tommy obrien just beyond
me in the bomb-proof it was two
days before we could get his body to
the rear

  i see youve a bunch of new rec-


the blue book magazine

ords taking them up with you on
thursday 

  aye-as far as commissary-hcad-
quarters pat odonnel is the last of
our crowd to be stuck with trench-
detail well have him back of the lines
next week then every man will be
available when the time comes-
faith boyle-be careful one
never knows how far a voice may carry
ye know

  t rue for you phaidrig  but
theres no harm done tis understood
that we talk a bit among ourselves on
what we hear of the staff plans an
everyone knows therell be somethin
afoot before long

lltor an hour lammerford and
 marie latour caught no remarks
from the other apartment which might
be construed as having a double mean-
ing then couramont came into the
rear room with one of the women for
a glass of wine they were chatting
upon commonplace topics but in the
midst of it sir francis noticed her lips
moving in an undertone having had
a good deal of practice in lip-reading
he had little difficulty in understanding
the question she asked when is it
to be man ami but as the deputy
was standing with his back to the win-
dow the watchers could make nothing
of his answer in a few moments the
party broke up-and marie whispered
is it that some danger threatens
france msieu

 old ma belle one which is
serious of a certainty and its a ques-
tion whether one may discover the
details in time to kill the whole of it
me-i know now of a dozen people
who must be watched from hour to
hour yet if one speaks of the matter

lo	m le prefect it is possible that plans
of the war staff may be disarranged
in consequence as yet we have no
proof that it is not some portion of the
summer campaign which they have been
discussing with so much secrecy-but
me i convince myself that it is some-
thing more serious than that you will
continue to watch via belle-both at
les trois gascons and here i will
write down the number of my own
pied-d-terre in the faubourg st hon-

ore-sol you will come to me if you
learn anything of importance my con-
cierge madame fauvette will admit
thee to wait if i am not chez moi in
the meanwhile  will find others to
keep our friends over there under
observation

  as he picked up his hat and gloves
there was an expression upon her
pretty face which indicated the extent
to which his service three years before
had won her affections he kissed her
in friendly camaraderie-and went
down the stairs

it was but eight or ten blocks to the

  rue royale where he dropped in at
the automobile club-happening to
overhear a remark in the foyer which
indicated a bit of unexpected good luck
a member was speaking of the english
admiral and european celebrity lord
trevor of dartmoor known to inti-
mates like lammerford as the diplo-
matic free lance as having left the
club not fifteen minutes before

  calling a taxi sir francis motored
out to his lordships modest but per-
fect house on the avenue de neuiliy-
maintained in constant readiness for
occupancy the year around by his staff
of english and afghan servants as
lammerford was considered practically
a member of his lordships family the
afghan khansamah welcomed him with
deep respect and ushered him up to the
room he usually occupied-his lord-
ship not having arrived within a few
moments however trevor came in-
followed by sabub ali more compan-
ion than servant with the suit-cases
joining sir francis in the library he
lighted one of his famous long cigars
and drew a breath of quiet satisfaction

  gad lammy its a bit of luck
findin you here-what

  thats the remark i made to myself
when i heard you were in paris i lost
no time getting out here 

  why  have you picked up another
thread-when nobody in the city
appears to dream that anythings amiss
yet 

  humph  i dont know what youve
happened upon ive learned since
morning that a prominent deputy-an
intensely loyal frenchman for eighteen
free lances in diplomacy	

years mind you-is actually a wil-
helmstrasse agent and is now planning
some coup so far-reaching and unex-
pected that im more nervous than ive
been in a good many months what
do you know about it

  as to anything at this end-noth-
ing of course therell be little in the
paris papers for several days were
keeping the tiling as quiet as possible
for obvious reasons but-sinn fein-
ers captured the dublin post office the
metropole and practically all of sack-
ville street yesterday-shot a number
of officers as they were returning from
the races are sniping off soldiers and
civilians in every direction and have
burned hundreds of buildings-and
scattered mobs of them are rising all
through the south of ireland we
knew of course that they were armed
and drilling but didnt look for any
such treacherous outbreak while the
empire was fighting for its life itll
take fifteen or twenty thousand of the
army to handle the thing-an theres
no telling in how many other directions
it may show itself sir roger case-
ment was arrested near tralee after
being put ashore from a german sub-
marine-and convoying a supply-ship
with enough arms to have set half
ireland ablaze or at least all the dis-
affected lot fortunately three-quar-
ters of the country is loyal to his
majestys government an will remain
so but-

  aye-but now listen to what ive
stumbled upon as briefly as possi-
ble he sketched the haunting resem-
blance in couramonts face as he came
out of the rue rivoli arcade and what
he had since learned theres not one
of those officers or the women either
who isnt irish-and to the best of my
knowledge from the southern counties
couramont or schmaltz we know to
be a wilhelmstrasse spy who has been
waiting eighteen years to do at some
critical moment what he is ordered to
do by his superiors in berlin-probably
serving the auswartiges amt many
times to good purpose during those
years as well and undoubtedly
there are a dozen or more like him in
this thing from what you tell me its
rather obvious that what they and those

irish officers are planning is the more
serious part of the sinn fein plot-and
theyve worked in the surest possible
way to avert suspicion

  weve certainly no proof to act
upon yet lammy wait a bit i
think i know of a way to get some
do you know-or do you remember
hearing about-corporal dennis corri-
gan of that limerick regiment  he
lost his left hand and wrist in the early
retreat-the rear-guard action-and
was decorated for an act of conspicuous
bravery being disabled of course he
couldnt serve any more and he opened
a gambling club for officers in the rue
de savoie south of the seine it is
winked at by the prefecture because
he maintains a quiet orderly place
where there is seldom any very high
play-catering largely to the foreign
element in paris though his rooms are
patronized by journalists and members
of the chamber as well

  i happen to know that corrigan was
an old-time fenian-hes nearer sixty
than forty-five though youd never
imagine it from his appearance i also
know practically all the signs and pass-
words of the old fenian organization
and the sinn fein one of my press
syndicate editors obtained them for me
at the risk of his life now itll be a
simple matter for me to obtain any sort
of special passport i wish for one of
my syndicate war correspondents-say
an trish-american new yorker eh-
what 

  humph  wed best let no
word of this reach lady nan shed
see the necessity of course-but shed
have not a moments peace untl you
were back in london id undertake
it myself-but your knowledge makes
discovery less likely i can watch the
trois gascons and that apartment of
marie latours its even possible that
i may be able to conceal myself in
fitzpatricks rooms during the next
twenty-four hours

next evening the usual habitues of
corrigans club in the rue de
savoie observed with respectful interest
the skillful play and almost unbeliev-
able luck of a well set-up middle-aged
stranger whose manner and occa-


the blue book magazine

sional remarks indicated the american
war correspondent now becoming so
familiar to the parisians the banque
had been winning heavily from its regu-
lar patrons when the new yorker
arrived with lieutenant james ocon-
nor-down for a two-day furlough-
who had run across him in the cafe des
trois gascons the smile of half-
recognition upon the americans face
convinced oconnor that they had met
before-reilly none other than the
disguised lord trevor being so thor-
oughly conversant with the families
of kerry and cork so prompt with
certain words and signs which such a
man should know that the lieutenant
was anxious to have him meet corrigan
without delay his sitting-in at the
game and winning so irresistibly was
merely incidental-but it won the
admiration of every irishman in the
room most of them having some knowl-
edge of the deadly game a tammany
politician learns to play in new york

  reilly at last cashed in for thirty
thousand francs the bulk of which had
been won by the house from a russian
diplomat and one of the wealthy jour-
nalists of paris before his arrival
afterward oconnor and a major
phelan escorted him through a con-
cealed passage into another building
where the one-handed corrigan was
smoking in a little private den the
ex-corporal appeared to be thoroughly
informed as to reillys winnings and
his supposed antecedents-greeting him
with a grin of appreciation

  faith tis said a tammany irish-
man bates the worrld me frind-an
its mesilf believes it sit ye down an
smoke a seegyar with me tell me
now misthcr reilly-hows the bys in
new yorrk an what yell be doin over
here in the newspaper line

  reilly-whom lord trevors inti-
mate friends would not have recog-
nized so completely misleading were
the subtle changes he had made in dress
and facial expression-named several
papers of the syndicate he represented
exhibited very unusual credentials in
lh wav of passport and special permits
visit the trenches and implied more
by looks than words that his errand in
 ranee was not altogether a journalistic

one he delighted them by handing
over to corrigan the entire thirty thou-
sand francs he had just won-to be
expended in any worthy cause which
the ex-corporal might have in mind-
and casually remarked that he had left
dublin two days before completely dis-
gusted with the impatience which had
led to an outbreak there at a moment
when it was practically certain to fail

they listened to this in amazement-
then put a sinister question or two
which would have cost him his life had
he answered with the slightest hesita-
tion but he exhibited such a grasp of
details-having received by radiogram
three hours before reports of the
dublin situation which they would have
no means of getting for several days-
that he convinced them by what
appeared to be absolute knowledge of
far more than local conditions after
demonstrating the force of his conten-
tion until they saw it clearly he risked
a shot in the dark

  i suppose youll agree with me that
the business over yon changes matters
a good bit for dye see if you
attempt to go on with this end of the
plan now tis likely that many of ye are
bein watched before ye can act
together in one grand series of blows
theyll be nipping first one and then
another of ye-till tis the devils own
mess youll be in and a file of sharp-
shooters against the first wall for every
man

  it was a chance he scarcely dared
hope it would draw them yet it had
been done with such consummate natu-
ralness that they must have been gifted
with almost superhuman telepathy to
have avoided the trap they fell into it
with no suspicion of the bait

  but-domn it all man therell
he never another such chance in
jears tis ourselves has schamed for
months-has watched this one an that
one till we know the day an the hour
theyll be in certain places tis the
wires weve laid an the frame-ups
weve planned to lure thim all into five
diltrent places the same hour-so we
may make a clane job of it  theyll be
two min doggin every mimber of the
british cabinet-fourteen laders of the
free lances in diplomacy	

peers an commons-six admirals-an
eight major-ginerals over here-whin
the hour strikes

  an that night yeve set it for
less than two weeks away of course
thats why im tellin ye tis madness-
after the fools work in dublin

  man-tis one wake from this night
has been set fr the job

  aye while our own leaders are
bein shot in dublin or the tower
when the eyes of europe are watchin
every irishman in the british isles and
on the continent go on with it if ye
will this day two weeks yell all be
rottin four feet under the sod send
out the worrd i tell ye send out the
worrd to-morrow put off the day two
months then twill come upon them
like a blow in the dark-from heaven
knows where-and yell paralyze the
entente do it now an the ententell
snuff ye out like so many candle-wicks
go awn-any way ye like im tellin
ye-thats all

  they were impressed convinced
even yet the sudden disarrangement of
their plans threw them into momen-
tary panic how to inform each mem-
ber of their organization in time it
seemed an impossible task

  an wholl carry the worrd to eng-
land im wishin to know this
from corrigan  tis possible no
doubt to pass the word through
france but dye see the most of us is
detailed here an yon behind the firin-
lines they get away for a bit of fur-
lough to rest from the strain of con-
stant fightin-but they must account
for every move they make weve no
way of givin the whisper to those in
england unless one of us bears it there
tis no aisy job to go an come as ye
plaze in these days-as ye well know
reilly

deilly lighted a fresh cigar and
spread open his special passport
upon the table

  faith tis myself can do the job if
ye wish my papersll pass me with
little trouble dye see i would not be
sittin idle an seein a lot of the finest
men old ireland ever grew-god bless
her-lined up against a wall an shot
for makin the mistake of strikin

before twas possible to drive the stroke
home

  the offer was made so naturally so
spontaneously that it carried them off
their feet and banished every particle
of suspicion they might have had in
half an hour he had committed to mem-
ory a dozen names and addresses in
london manchester and liverpool
with additional passwords and the
cards of three officers which had little
pencil-dots under certain engraved let-
ters in each name

  reilly was stopping at a little hotel
frequented by americans in the rue de
echelle and oconnor went there
with him when he left in the morn-
ing the war correspondent assumed
that he would be shadow-ed by some of
the organization and so after making
a few purchases he walked along to the
cafe des trois gascons for a late
breakfast casually sitting down at one
of marie latours tables as if he pre-
ferred the quieter part of the room
she had no consciousness of ever hav-
ing seen the man before yet something
in the glance he gave her appeared
familiar when she brought his ome-
lette and coffee he said-in so low a
tone that it couldnt have been over-
heard ten feet away

 you remember m le chevalier-
who was in your apartment last eve-
ning ttm belle

  msieu is insulting one does not
comprehend 

  trts bieii ma fille me-i make
my apologies and i entrust a message
to your care m le chevalier will be
here for his coffee and rolls very soon
whisper to him the calais boat-
this afternoon-without fail he will
understand perfectly-and you will
have served france better than you
know another cafe-au-lait if you
please-and bacon with the kidneys

  the message was delivered in his
exact words-marie feeling much
relieved at lammerfords assurance
that it was from one of the great ones
in the corps diplomatique so it came
about that bir francis was in the gare
du nord when the calais train pulled
out-having barely time to run along
the platform and jump into a compart-
ment in which there was but one other


the blue book magazine

jassenger an american war corre-
spondent who was reading an afternoon
journal after the guard had inspected
their tickets-proceeding along the
running-board outside of the coupes-
lammerford borrowed a light for his
cigar from the american and they fell
into a casual discussion of the situation
in the trenches long before the train
reached calais he was asleep by the
window at one end of the compart-
ment-and reilly at the other yet
lammerford was now conversant with
the whole plot and knew just what
action to take upon his return to paris
by the morning train

v iien reilly arrived at charing
 cross a telegram from sir fran-
cis had preceded him consequently
after registering at the piccadilly hotel
he was given a room and bath on the
second floor which if required for such
a purpose could be made part of a
suite-there being a communicating
door on the opposite side of the bath-
room he had assumed that corrigan
was telling only the simple truth when
he said it was practically impossible for
one of their organization to leave for
england without a good deal of red
tape which was sure to attract unde-
sirable attention but he was also con-
vinced that the sinn feiner would
manage in some way to have him fol-
lowed at every step if it were possible
to do so-hence the precautions which
lammerford had taken for him

  he readied the hotel about mid-
night-too late to see the men whose
names he had memorized so after a
supper in the grill he went to bed turn-
ing off the lights within fifteen minutes
after locking the door of his room
meanwhile a wealthy mine-owner from
the cape-secretly connected with
downing street-had been given the
suite adjoining reillys at ten oclock
sir edward wray secretary of state
for foreign affairs had arrived at the
piccadilly in his motor and sent up a
card to the mine-owner who received
him in his suite when reilly opened
the door from his bathroom at half-past
twelve sir edward was smoking in the
dark while his mining friend had shut
himself into the further room of the

suite during that half-hour interview
in the dark sir edward was given
names and addresses which he jotted
down in pencil to avoid mistakes

   for the next forty-eight hours reilly
was busy motoring about london in a
taxi leaving cards as a war corre-
spondent desiring interviews at the
houses of various people more or less
prominent in the army or london
society in several instances he found
the men at home and gave them corri-
gans instructions-the londoners see-
ing the danger of immediate action in
carrying out their prearranged plan
more quickly than had the men in
france the fiasco in dublin was
having its effect upon them and the
military executions had a very sobering
influence even while they enraged the
conspirators almost beyond endurance

in each interview lord trevor-as the
 pseudo-reilly-had the feeling that
the man with whom he had been talking
was merely an executive that the brains
of the whole movement was a person of
much greater influence and prominence
consequently his casual glances about
the different rooms took and recorded
every little detail which might be of use
in tracing the chief conspirator in one
house the gentleman was obliged to
leave the room for a few moments in
response to a message from one of the
ladies of his family during his
absence trevor noticed a fragment of
paper covered with fine handwriting
upon the flat-topped library desk-a
half-page apparently torn from some
letter the writing appeared curiously
familiar but he couldnt place it-so he
pocketed the scrap for more careful
examination later

  he knew that anyone who might be
following him about during the day
would consider his calling upon one or
two prominent men not connected with
the conspiracy a clever blind to cover
the work he was actually doing and so
he motored around to the handsome
park lane mansion of lord and lady
trevor about six in the afternoon as
soon as he was inside and had been
recognized by his afghan khansomah
he went into the big library to search
through half a dozen great scrap-books
free lances in diplomacy	

which contain many thousands of
handwriting-specimens arranged and
indexed according to their style-their
heavy or light strokes peculiar forma-
tions of vowels and consonants and
general alignment in the course of an
hour he came upon two pages of speci-
mens very closely resembling the scrap
he had managed to secure-but not
exactly upon the next page he found
a fac-simile-with a well-known signa-
ture under it

  lord kilimainine my word a
kerry man to be sure-and yet-whod
have thought it a man who has
served for years in the diplomatic serv-
ice-has received honors and prefer-
ment from the crown

tiie man who left the trevor man-

	sion and motored away in his taxi
resembled mr reilly in a general way
the chauffeur didnt look at him
closely but drove him back to the hotel
piccadilly where he paid the taxi-fare
and went in as if stopping there at
the desk however he merely asked for
a gentleman whom he knew was not in
at the time-and went out by the
regent street entrance that was the
last ever seen of reilly the new york
war correspondent his suit-case was
held by the hotel people for a month or
so and scotland yard notified but it
was finally assumed that he had been
waylaid and killed in some mysterious
manner

  at nine oclock the evening reilly
disappeared lord trevor with sir
edward wray and two officers of the
general staff called upon lord kili-
mainine at his luxuriously furnished
town house he received them cour-
teously escorting the party back to his
den and smoking-room at the rear of
the house overlooking a walled garden
lord trevor indicated the object of
their visit by expressing his understand-
ing that kilimainine was rather well
acquainted with the french deputy
m henri couramont-asking if he
could give them any information as to
the mans antecedents the irishmans
eyes narrowed slightly as he glanced
from one to another of them subcon-

sciously he noticed that none of the
four had lighted the cigars he offered
them

  ive met the man your lordship
more than once-but in a purely social
way do you mind telling me your
object in asking such a question

 why--er-couramont was exe-
cuted this afternoon in paris in a
rather sensational way he was
arrested at his offices in the courier dti
matin building-placed handcuffed in
an open cart driven up and down the
champs filysees and boulevards for
several hours with a placard on his
back this placard stated that for
eighteen years he had posed as a loyal
frenchman gaining honors and posi-
tion in paris while all the time he was
actually captain heinrich schmaltz a
secret agent of the wilhelmstrasse at
sunset in the place de la concorde
which was packed with one of the
largest crowds ever gathered there he
was shot it had been discovered that
he was one of the chief instigators of
a sinn fein plot which contemplated a
good deal more serious and widespread
action than the dublin affair the
other leader is known to be a certain
irish peer

  with a smile of sardonic incredulity
as they supposed kilimainine opened a
drawer of the table by which he sat-
and reached in apparently for a docu-
ment which they could see at the back
of it when his hand came out how-
ever there was a flash-a stunning
report

  lord trevor winced a little as the
ball went through the inner muscles of
his left arm-though the eye behind his
monocle continued to gaze inquiringly
at his would-be assassin then there
came an answering flash from the vicin-
ity of his right hip lord kilimainine
sank back in his chair shot through the
heart-and trevor was hurried out of
the house by one of the generals before
the arrival of the doctor or members f
kilimainines family as the starched
front of the dead mans evening-shirt
was somewhat blackened by powder-
grains it was assumed that he had com-
mitted suicide

thomas gardner presi-
dent of the haven satchel
company nodded toward one
of the workmen thats
haven he said he owned the whole
plant once

  yes returned nathan matson ive
heard about it pretty hard for a
man to have to work for wages in a
factory that he built himself

  how did he come to make the high
dive asked christopher matson his
son

  the senior matson who disapproved
of flippancy in business matters gave
the young man a withering look but
gamer replied with a laugh father
gave him a push

  must be a good pusher commented
christopher

  he is asserted gardner

  a little later in another department
gardner pointed again this time to a
girl havens daughter he ex-
plained

  if anybody pushed her asserted
christopher after a quick glance id
crawl a thousand miles on my hands
and knees for the sake of a chance to
boot him

  chris admonished his father
sharply

  well call it nine hundred then
modified christopher

  oh no one pushed her gardner
hastened to assure him she just clung
to her father and went down with
him

if shed cling to me commented
christopher you could push me off
the washington monument and wel-
come

the senior matson frowned his dis-
approval but said nothing in reply to

 this

the inspection of the plant finished
gardner and the matsons returned to
the formers office where nathan mat-
son went to the heart of tilings in his
usual direct way

now exactly whats your proposi-
tion he asked

we need more money explained
gardner the company is capitalized
for only fifty thousand and it should be
double that fifty thousand isnt
enough to swing the business we are
now doing

cant swing the cat with so short a
tail suggested christopher

chris said his father i wish
youd talk english when were consid-
ering a strictly business proposition like
this

thats the latest english i know
returned christopher some of the
boys could beat it but im not strictly
up to date now

haven began in a small way gard-
ner went on ignoring the interruption
anti when he finally incorporated he
was too modest-didnt look far enough
into the future we want to issue fifty
thousand more stock sell at par and
put the money into the business but
its too good a tiling to be tossed out

the guile of ruth



to the crowd thats why father sug-
gested you	going to take twenty-
five thousand himself and he thought
you might like lo get in for the other
twenty-five

  youll be in control suggested
matson

  father and i will replied gardner
well still have a five-share majority
just as i have now

  matson reflected if i put in twenty-
five thousand he said at last it will
be for chris and i shall want him to
come in here so as to learn the
business

  been at large too long explained
christopher heres where they put
the shackles on

  quite right agreed gardner re-
plying to the senior matson i had to
do that myself and ive never in the
least regretted it

  matson asked a few searching ques-
tions and then picked up some papers
that gardner had given him earlier
ill look over these statements and re-
ports to-night he said and let you
know to-morrow

  one thing more put in gardner
detaining the two as they were about
to leave we plan to change the name
of the company when we increase the
capitalization rather absurd to have
haven in the name when hes no longer
in the company

  i dont know about that returned
matson doubtfully the haven satchel
and the haven shopping-bag are dis-
tinctive in some ways and have at-
tained wide popularity

  well substitute gardner for hav-
en  explained gardner

  and throw away a lot of money
advertising the change commented
matson it costs about as much to
change the name of a popular article as
it does to introduce a new one

  but haven-

  i dont care a hoot about haven
interrupted matson he sold his name
with the company and the names
worth money only a fool throws away
money ask your father

  as for me put in christopher id
rather draw down the big money at the
box-office than have my name on the
billboards

  this had a tendency to make gard-
ner peevish for it compelled the
abandonment temporarily at least of a
cherished plan in the absence of ob-
jection from any other source his
father might have been prevailed upon
to agree to the change of name but
david gardner was a decided material-
ist in business matters unswayed by
either vanity or sentiment and it was a
foregone conclusion that he would side
with the matsons if they made a definite
stand this in itself was sufficient to
irritate the junior gardner but there
was also humiliation in the way they
had disposed of his suggestion he
would have been glad to drop the nego-
tiations with them and sell the stock
elsewhere but here again his father had
to be considered

  just the same he grumbled
theyre going to be badly fooled if they
think they can run things here for i
wont have it

  that evening the matsons senior and
junior sat late in the formers library
busy with the facts and figures revealed
by the papers gardner had given them 
its a good proposition was the
conclusion the senior readied i dont
know much about the boy but david
gardner isnt in the habit of losing
money and i guess we can rely upon
him to see that a prosperous business
isnt jeopardized by any foolishness
besides youll have a strong enough
minority interest to entitle you to con-
sideration its as good a chance as
any young man can ask but youll have
to buckle down and learn the business
from the ground up if youre going to
make the most of it you must go into
the shop-

  under an assumed name stipulated
christopher

  why questioned his father
papas boy isnt very popular with
the workmen explained christopher
hes likely to be a good deal of a joke
and theyre a bit afraid of him too
anyhow thats the way it looks to me
and i wouldnt want that girl giving
me the frosty eye

  what girl

why havens daughter of course
replied christopher shes a pippin
i have always understood re-


the blue book magazine

turned mr matson austerely that a

pippin was an apple

sure agreed christopher the ap-
ple of my eye hut whats this haven

story guv

  as near as i can make out re-
turned the senior caustically all you
acquired at college was slang and iiip-
pancy  dont care to be addressed that
way father is more dignified and re-
spect ful

  too formal objected christopher
lets compromise on dad whats
the haven story dad for of course
there is a story

  mr matson tacitly accepted the com-
promise because it was about the best
he could do with his effervescent son
his brow clouded as he considered the
question however rather an un-
pleasant one as it comes to me he re-
plied but it doesnt concern us jim

i	laven made the business it had been
his life work he started alone in a
small way took in a partner and finally
incorporated dave gardner took some
stock in the company and put his boy
in to learn the business just as i am
doing with you he and haven had
been close friends but they had a mis-
understanding of some sort-i never
did hear just what it was anyhow
he set out deliberately to get havens
scalp and it was not a particularly diffi-
cult job haven was a good man in
the shop end of the business but he was
weak in the office end of it moreover
he had a propensity for taking an oc-
casional flier in stocks of which he
knew nothing while gardner knew the
stock market game backwards and side-
ways so playing upon these two weak-
nesses gardner finally got him in a
corner and he didnt leave himeven a
postage stamp when he got throtffi with
him

  got it on the collar-button  com-
mented christopher but why did he
go to work in the shop 

  thats what i cant understand re-
plied the senior matson

  some sentiment in it possibly sug-
gested christopher

  ouite likely agreed his father
anyhow he applied for a job and got
it the idea rather appealed to gard-
ners sense of humor i imagine then

too haven must be a very valuable man
in the shop end of the business al-
though i judge from the fact that his
daughter is working also that lie isnt
getting what he should be worth
anybody whod put that kind of a
deal over on a peach- began christo-
pher indignantly

  peach exclaimed matson are
you referring to haven

  i wasnt even thinking of haven
replied christopher

ii

j ames haven emerged from the
little den in which he pottered and
pondered when not at the shop
and his face was radiant with the joy
of achievement haven was one of
those men who are always working
either with hand or brain there were
always problems relating to the business
that he was seeking to solve but they
were always shop problems never office
problems in the office end of the busi-
ness he had never been very deeply
interested and it was through the con-
stant improvement of the output of the
plant tliat he had achieved success while
he was in charge now as a mere
salaried man he still pottered and pon-
dered in his little den at home when he
was not in the shop for his pleasure
lay in what he did rather than in what
he earned

  ive perfected the self-locking
catch he announced ill take it to
gardner to-morrow

  mrs haven looked up from her sew-
ing and nodded mrs haven knowing
nothing of business matters took every-
thing that her husband did on faith
but ruth haven shook her head

  no objected ruth you must
patent it first

  do you think hed steal it from me 
asked haven

  he stole the whole business from
you didnt he retorted ruth

  no replied haven dubiously no
id hardly say that

  but he got it insisted the girl
yes he got it-that is dave gard-
ner got it and gave it to his son but
it was mostly my own fault i guess
the guile of ruth



and it was business no doubt i dont
think id ever have taken the same ad-
vantage if id had the chance but i can
see that it was business and dave
gardner is a business man anyhow i
wasnt thinking of going to him with it
but to tom its tom whos the head
of the company now

  the figurehead of the company
scoffed ruth

  you mustnt be too hard on toni
contended haven he wasnt the one
who got me out of the company and
he made a- place for m in the shop
when i asked him i dont know what
id have done otherwise ive been so
wrapped up in the work for so long that
i dont think id fit in anywhere else
he took you back retorted ruth
to feed his own vanity he likes to
point you out as the man who once
owned the business and lost it to a bet-
ter man he finds humor and flattery
in it i guess ive seen him youre
exhibit a and im exhibit b

  oh no not that expostulated ha-
ven

  oh yes just that insisted ruth
hes got all his fathers unscrupulous-
ness without his fathers brains he
isnt paying you what youre worth
either

  perhaps not perhaps not conceded
haven but thats business too how-
ever ill apply for a patent before say-
ing anything to him about it

  is it really so very valuable asked
mrs haven

  well no not intrinsically con-
fessed haven its merely a catch that
you lock by touching a spring and then
cant unlock without a key but it ought
to be worth a good deal as a feature of
the haven bags and satchels

  it ought to be worth a good deal to
the haven company just to keep rivals
from getting it suggested ruth

  why yes i think so agreed ha-
ven no doubt they can devise some-
thing similar but the concern that gets
into the market first with that improve-
ment should have a big advantage id
like to talk to mason about that
no objected ruth

  haven and his wife were both sur-
prised and showed it hes a very
bright young fellow argued haven

-rather flippant but still with a deal
to him id have considerable confi-
dence in his judgment

  no insisted ruth not until its
patented

  i thought you liked him said ha-
ven in bewilderment

duths cheeks reddened at the sim-
a pie directness of that but she re-
plied to it indifferently oh i find
him entertaining she said i like his
company well enough and theres a
good deal of purpose under his flip-
pancy but do you happen to know who
he is

  why hes mason of course just
mason a man in the shops responded
haven what more should he be
no he isnt just mason of course
retorted ruth he dropped a letter
out of his name when he went to work
for the haven company he isnt
mason at all but christopher matson
owner of a one-fourth interest in the
company

  are you sure of that

  theres no doubt at all asserted
ruth i saw tom gardner showing
him over the plant and my curiosity
was aroused when he came to work
later so-well kitty barnard gard-
ners stenographer is a friend of mine
and i found out about him hes chris-
topher matson and his father took half
of the new stock issue in his name
but why-why- floundered ha-
ven

  i dont know replied ruth he
was probably put in your charge to
learn the business but why he should
choose to go under an assumed name i
dont know

  youve been unusually nice to him
commented haven

  why not retorted ruth defiantly
isnt he just the man i should be nice
to when i have the chance and you
made the chance

  no returned haven pondering
no i did not he made it himself by
asking if he could come here some eve-
ning to talk shop matters over with me
and then he never said a word about
shop when he came and he never has
yet he added i hardly even see him
when he comes


the blue book magazine

  ruth blushed and laughed but her
reply was almost brazen so much
the better she said he may be use-
ful to us

  ruth reproved mrs haven i
dont like to hear you talk that way
especially about a man you dont
trust added haven

  i never said i didnt trust him
protested ruth but hes in financial
company that  dont trust and theres
no use taking chances dont you say
anything to anybody father until your
application for a patent is filed

  oh very well agreed haven

  and then assign it to me added
ruth

  what exclaimed haven

  assign it to me repeated ruth
youre too easy and innocent to handle
the matter-so ill do it myself

liaven objected to this but he
ended by doing as his daughter
wished he usually ended by doing as
she wished in any matter upon which
she was insistent for in spite of her
youth and sex hers was the more prac-
tical mind and the stronger will he
had a great admiration as well as a
deep affection for his daughter so
by her advice he took his self-locking
clasp to a patent lawyer and nothing
was said of it to anyone else until the
application was recorded in the patent
office then ruth mentioned it to chris-
topher although without intimating that
she had discovered the missing letter in
the name he had given she had a
personal reason for going to him with
it

  i took the precaution of applying
for a patent first she explained watch-
ing him narrowly

  wise girl commended christopher
who by the way had not deemed it
necessary to change his given name
no use taking any chances with these
smooth business boys

  it ought to be worth a good deal to
the i laven company she suggested

  sure he agreed stick em up and
take it away from them make em
come across with a dray

  still she qualified one mustnt be
too acquisitive it isnt a necessity  they
can get along without it

  oh yes he returned they can get
along without it but they cant afford
to let anybody else have it thats
where youve got em by the ear

  he seemed to be perfectly sincere
and she wanted to believe that he was
perfectly sincere but if so he was cer-
tainly blind to his own interests and
there was also the fact that he was
masquerading under an assumed name
to raise a doubt still there was the
pleasant thought that in the matter of
the self-locking catch he might be sacri-
ficing his own interests for her and it
was a very pleasant thought any-
how there was nothing for her to do
but go ahead with her plan that
would uncover his real attitude in the
matter

duth took the catch to tom gard-
ner he was considerably surprised
when she asked to see him for he was
under no misapprehension as to her
attitude haven himself might accept
his financial downfall as the fortune
or misfortune of business but she
made a personal matter of it that
was the trouble with women anyway
he reflected they made everything per-
sonal they were utterly unpractical
in business matters so he was sur-
prised and somewhat disturbed when
she sought an interview with him in his
private office so far as he could judge
she was not one of the tearful kind
but she blamed him for her own and her
fathers troubles and there might be
a scene of some sort

  lie was relieved therefore when she
produced the catch and made a very
businesslike explanation of her purpose
but he was annoyed when she casually
mentioned that the necessary steps had
been taken to patent the device

  is your father afraid well steal it
he asked

  oh dear no she replied father
is very trusting-too trusting i made
him patent it

  because youre afraid wed steal
it lie questioned caustically

  i believe was her evasive rejoinder
that the first rule of business is self-
protection isnt it

  he did not answer that directly
whats done in our shops on our time
the guile of ruth



is ours he said i doubt if your
father has any right to a patent

  this work was done in his own den
on his own time she returned and
youll have some difficulty taking the
patent away from him i think

  its of no great consequence any-
way he remarked indifferently its
a nice little device but not at all neces-
sary

  so long as no one else gets it she
suggested

  if he took it to anyone else he
threatened wed hardly feel justified
in keeping him in our employ

  if he took it to anyone else she
countered hed sell his services with
the patent and you couldnt keep him
in your employ

  gardner was irritated and he showed
it in spite of her sex she was far too
businesslike to suit him for she had
gone straight to the point that had the
most influence with him oh of
course wed like to have it he con-
ceded but its not important enough
to command much of a price what
does he want for it 

  twenty-five shares of stock in the
haven company she replied

  what he cried in amazement
twenty-five shares of stock she
repeated

  dont joke miss haven he ad-
vised where do you suppose i could
get twenty-five shares for that pur-
pose 

that doesnt concern me she said
the stock is held by a few people
he argued and none of it is in the
market you dont expect me to let go
of any of my own do you 

  it might be apportioned among you
all she suggested each selling to the
company in proportion to his holdings
and the company could then turn it over
to father in payment for his patent

c he was certainly very businesslike-
too businesslike he had an uncom-
fortable feeling that he was somehow
outmatched-and by a woman

  even if that could be done he
argued youre asking more than the
patent is worth to us

  she did not think so but she finally
receded somewhat from her position

agreeing to take twenty instead of twen-
ty-five shares that little victory made
him feel better merely because it was a
point scored and not at all because of
the comparatively trilling amount of
money involved but she still insisted
upon payment in stock

  its a matter of sentiment she ex-
plained father should have an in-
terest in the company that bears his
name

  ill talk the matter over with your
father he said

  oh very well she agreed but it
wont do any good

  why not he demanded

  because father has assigned his
patent to me and i want a haven in
the haven company

  it may not be the haven company
very long he retorted

  what  cried the girl in amazement
you surely wouldnt change the
name

  gardner had let his irritation betray
him into an admission that he had not
intended to make at that time but hav-
ing made it he felt that he must hold
to it it will be the gardner company
and the gardner satchel and the gard-
ner shopping-bag and the gardner
everything he declared

  im glad to know that she returned
thoughtfully but it makes no change
in the present situation we want
twenty shares of stock for the patent

  ill think it over said gardner
i doubt if the matter can be arranged
on those terms but ill let you know
later

  his first move then was to send for
christopher to whom he explained
ruth havens proposition

  foxy girl commented christopher
the stock is worth more than par-so
shes getting more for the patent than
appears on the face of the deal but
let her have it of course-pass it out to
her with a smile the patents worth
it i guess

  shed make trouble if she could
complained gardner

  but how could she  rejoined chris-
topher in her place id throw a har-
poon myself if i could but how could
she-with only twenty shares out of a
thousand 


the blue book magazine

gardner nodded there was im-
plied censure for the company and
sympathy for the havens in what chris-
topher said which gardner did not like
but the reasoning was correct she
couldnt of course agreed gardner
i suppose we might turn in the neces-
sary stock at par as she suggests but
ill have to give the matter a little
thought before deciding youll put in
vour proportion i presume

  oh sure replied christopher
glad to do it why say if she should
put anything over on us-

  yes

  id laugh myself to death

  this was so far from gardners idea
of a humorous situation that he ven-
tured to voice his displeasure i fear
you fail to see this from a business
viewpoint he said coldly

  a pretty face always blocks my
view returned christopher

  ill think it over said gardner
again-which was merely his way of
saying that he would talk it over with
his father he liked to pretend even to
himself that his power was autocratic
as he meant it should be some day but
as yet his father had to be considered
in all important matters at the same
time he did not deem it necessary
always to tell his father everything and
in this case he neglected to mention his
plan for changing the name of the com-
pany perhaps that would have made a
difference in the result of the interview
perhaps the senior gardner would have
reposed less confidence in his son if he
had known however he did not know
and he was inclined to agree that the
self-locking catch was worth having

  and argued the junior if we
need the stock we give haven we can
take it away from him just as we did
before

  possibly admitted the senior du-
biously but sometimes its not so easy
to turn a trick the second time

  what can he do with twenty shares
anyhow persisted the junior

  in a fight answered the senior
twenty shares might represent the bal-
ance of power

  but there is no fight urged the
junior and ill still be far and away
the heaviest stockholder

  you exclaimcd the senior

  why yes returned his son coolly
youre going to turn your stock over
to me arent you

  the senior gardner studied the young
man for a moment and then laughed
youre not such a bad business man
in some ways tom he declared in
the matter of plain nerve youre very
good and nerve counts for a good deal
but you mustnt be impatient of
course i intend that the business shall
be yours so far as im concerned but
you mustnt be impatient i want to be
sure that you can handle it

  havent i proved that already de-
manded tom

  youve done very well replied his
father ive had to apply the brakes
once or twice but youve really done
very well

  then try me without the brakes
persisted tom leave the whole busi-
ness to me and see what i can do
perhaps i will tom perhaps i will
returned david gardner after a mo-
ment of thought responsibility is
necessary to development and perhaps
its time you had more of it

ill

matthew quigley owned

ninety-eight shares of stock
in the haven satchcl com-
pany he had owned one hundred but
the company had taken over at par two
shares as his proportion of the purchase
price of the self-locking catch that it
was a good purchase he did not doubt
but there was something in the way the
affair had been handled that he did not
like the gardners were too autocratic
-always had been too autocratic this
could be forgiven in david who was a
big man but it was decidedly exasperat-
ing in tom he never had liked tom
and he liked him less than ever now
for tom had first tried to bully him into
providing all the stock necessary to se-
cure the invention

  to quigley in this frame of mind
came ruth haven with a most astound-
ing proposition

   want your stock she explained

  its not for sale he replied as soon
the guile of ruth



as he recovered from his astonish-
ment

  oh i dont want to buy it she re-
turned  i just want lo control it
control it he replied his bewilder-
ment increasing for what purpose
to reorganize the company

  here was the most amazing young
woman he had ever met he knew her
as havens daughter and an employee
in the shop and she was talking of re-
organizing the company a right pretty
girl but her success in acquiring a few
shares for her father must have unset-
tled her reason

  but my dear girl he expostulated
my proxy wouldnt enable you to do
that

  of course not she agreed but
yours and a few others would

  do you realize how many
perfectly she picked up a pencil
from his desk and began scribbling on a
blank sheet of paper there are one
thousand shares she went on jotting
down the figures until recently the
gardners owned live hundred and five
of them but they had to give up ten to
get the self-locking catch and now tom
gardner owns four hundred and ninety-
five his father being out of it

  well your figures are correct ad-
mitted quigley but-

  in other words she interrupted
tom gardner owns forty-nine and a
half per cent and ive got to line up all
the rest

  its evident youve given the subject
some study he commented with a
smile

  my one ambition has been to get
back ever since they squeezed us out
there was something very wistful in
her eyes and voice as she said that and
quigley nodded i see he mur-
mured i see

  not part way back but all the way
she added

  youd put your father back at the
head of the company

  why not

  quigley shook his head now i
doubt if i could agree to that he said
even if i could to the rest hes too
unpractical in a business way

  if hes smart enough to win back
what he lost-

  that would be you not him inter-
rupted quigley

  its all the same she asserted you
probably wouldnt want a woman at the
head even if she did succeed where you
failed

  what do you mean by that he

asked

  why mr quigley she replied
youd have put tom gardner out long
ago if you could but you couldnt 
can but you couldnt



lie smiled at that she was so re-
freshingly frank and certain

  the office and the shop know more
of what goes on than you suspect she
added and i havent been studying the
situation all this time for nothing you
would like to have tom gardner out
but you havent been able to see a way
to get him out i have made a way
and its not such a difficult way as it
seems she went on quickly forestall-
ing his interruption there are only
five stockholders in addition to him-
matson barnes turner yourself and
my father for whom-i am acting you
and i are already in accord in this mat-
ter-

  oh we are he exclaimed

  entirely so she asserted calmly
thats why i am so frank with you

and that leaves only three

she continued matson is the biggest
holding two hundred and forty-live
shares since his contribution to the self-
locking catch fund and barnes and
turner hold the rest between them
barnes and turner have not been
aggressive as you have been occasion-
all but there is plenty of eason to
believe that personally and in a busi-
ness way they also find tom gardner
offensive and unsatisfactory and they
have great confidence in you now- if
i can get chris matson in line you
ought to be able to get barnes and
turner

  have you spoken to matson he
asked dubiously

  not yet

  he mav not come in

  i think he will

  quigley reflected he seems to be
a very capable young man in spite of
a rather frivolous streak in him he


the blue book magazine

commented and hes the heaviest
stockholder next to tom gardner now
that dave gardner is out hes in
training for a position of authority
and he might object-

   dont think that he will she in-
terrupted you see hes a very good
friend-of my fathers

  oh murmured quigley and again
he relapsed into thought i dont
think i can do it he decided at last
youre a very wonderful young wom-
an but youre planning on too small a
margin and it might result in the dis-
ruption of a business that is at least
fairly successful

  could it be hurt much worse than
by a change of name she asked

  a change of name he repeated
puzzled

  from haven to gardner she ex-
plained -the gardner satchel instead
of the haven satchel and so on

  oh that would be idiocy he de-
clared look at the money the com-
pany has spent establishing its name
well that change will be made she
asserted if gardner remains in con-
trol he told me so himself

  i believe reflected quigley that
he hinted something of the sort to me
once but it was so foolish that i merely
laughed at it and i supposed he had
abandoned the idea

  but he cant do it insisted quig-
ley he hasnt the necessary con-
trol

  the party in power argued the
girl has a much better chance of get-
ting and clinching that control than any-
body on the outside and now is our
chance to get in

  youre a very wonderful young
woman said quigley again and you
almost convince me but even if we can
oust gardner i doubt the wisdom of
putting your father in charge we
need a younger and more practical
head-

  my head is younger and more prac-
tical isnt it she demanded as a
matter of fact youd be getting two
heads instead of one

  its certainly young enough con-
cedcd quigley with a whimsical smile
and after the experience of the last
half hour i see no chance to deny that

its practical but if we decide to do
this why is it necessary for you to
handle all the stock why not let the
stockholders vote their own stock after
we come to an agreement with them 
that she replied is a little matter
of personal gratification and poetic jus-
tice i want tom gardner deposed by
a haven and im the only haven equal
to the task

  i guess youre right he agreed
fairly grinning over the idea i guess
youre right and when you tell me you
have matson in line ill go after the
other two

duth naturally was in haste to take

	 the question up with chris matson
then he still called frequently but
now it was avowedly to see her and not
on the pretense of talking shop with
her father she telephoned him to be
sure and come that evening and she
opened the subject as abruptly as she
had in the case of quigley

  chris she said i want your
stock

 stock he exclaimed what
stock

  haven company stock

  all in the discard he grumbled
youve discovered-

  i discovered the missing letter in
your name a long time ago she ex-
plained

  im soriy he said glumly id
rather vou hadnt learned that until-
until when

  i dont know he answered in some
confusion but id rather you hadnt
learned it yet anyway

  ruth seemed to find something amus-
ing and also pleasing in this but she
held to the main question i want your
stock she repeated

  oh sure he agreed and what do
i get

  dont ask silly questions she re-
proved this is a business matter
im going to depese gardner

  say he ejaculated as soon as he
had recovered from his surprise he
was bowling in the right alley after
all

  what do you mean  she asked

  he said youd do something of that
sort if you could
the guile of ruth



  well i can she asserted and then
she explained her plan

  he passed quickly from bewilder-
ment to laughter and his laughter was
long and loud

  what does that mean  she de-
manded

  im just keeping my promise he
explained i told gardner id laugh
myself to death if you harpooned him
whom will you make president
dont you think she returned now
watching him narrowly that it would
be poetic justice to put father back
he hesitated a moment then but only
a moment a glance at her face seemed
to decide him sure  he agreed go
to it im strong for father-if you
want him

  i thought youd feel that way about
it she said nodding and smiling but
i wanted to be sure

  oh yes he repeated resignedly
im strong for father

iv

ouigley was awaiting with
some impatience a report of
ruth havens interview with
tom gardner armed with the neces-
sary proxies ruth had gone to gardner
to demand the calling of a stockholders
meeting-a meeting that must be form-
ally called but that as matters then
stood would consist of only herself and
gardner and of course she could not
ask for this call without explaining the
purpose

  such a foolish man laughed ruth
when she finally appeared in quigleys
office ill have to have some more
money

  more money exclaimed quigley
i dont understand

  yes said ruth more money i
took some that i borrowed on fathers
stock just as precaution but it wasnt
enough you see he got quite ex-
cited-	

  i should think likely laughed quig-
ley

  oh yes quite excited repeated
ruth when i told him what i was
going to do and even more excited
when i showed him that i could do it

he stormed and raged a good deal about
traitors and sentimenalists said it meant
the wrecking of the company declared
a wise man would get out as quick as he
could and announced that his stock was
on the market so  optioned all i
could before he could back down

  oh you did  incredulous amaze-
ment was reflected in quigleys face

  of course replied ruth i
couldnt take it all but  got enough to
make our margin of control a safe one
--only youll have to help me through
with it you or some of the others
will have to take most of the stock i
optioned

  most surprising young woman i
ever knew murmured quigley but
well do it of course he added it
finally clinches the whole deal and well
be only too glad to do it but you-you
-well you have me dazed no wonder
he went out of his head and i suppose
it made him crazier when you told him
you were going to put your father
back

   oh i didnt tell-him that

  you didnt

  no you see i changed my mind
about that and when i told him i was
going to make mr matson presi-
dent-

  here here cried the startled
quigley tliat wont do

  why youve always spoken most
highly of him she urged

  oh yes hes capable and hes a
large stockholder and hes got some
grasp of the business now he ad-
mitted but we cant have plans upset
in this crazy way we agreed to your
father-

   no you didnt she retorted you
agreed to me

thats true too he conceded with
a smile we did in some measure-
then thats all right she declared
for im going to marry mr matson
quigley sank weakly back in his
chair marry matson he repeated
groping blindly for his wits marry
matson  youre going to- oh i sur-
render have it your own way but i
must certainly congratulate matson
oh no she cried in confusion
you mustnt congratulate him-not yet
he doesnt know it yet

  cast a most enchanting glamour about his doll-house

ihere are just three sorts of
men in this world who have
an ambition that is worth
a cuss-hermits billionaires
and burglars and all they ask is to be
left alone declared john rhodes on
the day when with painstaking atten-
tion to details he took the last precau-
tions to obliterate his footsteps and
disappeared he might have added
im one of em and if the inquisitive
had asked which one would probably
have answered burglar

  furthermore there were numerous
financiers over different sections of the
globe who would have agreed with
him heartily perhaps vociferously not
that the methods by which with
amazing and cumulative steadiness he
had acquired his vast fortune were
more reprehensible than those of other
financiers but because he was endowed
with such appalling foresight steadi-
ness of nerve and ingenuity of resource
that it seemed impossible to drive him
into a corner and keep him there and
this was naturally much of a disap-
pointment to rival magnates

  rhodes most peculiar characteristic

however was such a morbid hatred for
publicity that even those who could
have identified him on the street were
few it became a tradition that when-
ever possible his business was trans-
acted through agents-also that of these
agents richard kent was the one who
effected nearly all the largest deals and
that if there was any truth in the adage
like master like man rhodes must
have been a terror inasmuch as in
the parlance of the street kent was
a humdinger

  it was admitted that kent could be
neither bullied bribed influenced nor
employed because at different times all
these tactics had been tried unsuccess-
fully there were diverse opinions of
him some agreed with that expressed
by a certain renowned financial light
pillar of a fashionable church adver-
tised as a philanthropist moralist and
patriot who declared wrathfully
kent is nothing more nor less than a
blithering idiot a fool why do you
know hes so stupid that he can tell
rhodes money from his own he
refused fifty thousand dollars i offered
him as a gift when all he had to do to

author of the

get it was to tell me whether rhodes
was a bull or a bear on steel common 
plain dishonest i call him

  others disagreeing liked kent be-
cause he kept his word but most of
those were unimportant people-who
therefore didnt count

  that kent was astonishingly quali-
fied to act as rhodes agent in foreign
countries some were aware for among
his conspicuous talents was that of lan-
guages of which he made a hobby
and on one point everyone agreed
kents loyalty to rhodes

  this fidelity found further proof
when the master financier disappeared
inasmuch as at somewhere near the
same time or at least within a few
weeks after it had been announced that
rhodes had gone on an extended vaca-
tion kent likewise departed from new
york-presumably to attend his em-
ployers interests abroad he said that
was why he was going but he lied this
being his blunt idea of diplomacy

  and so having lied when he stated
that he was going abroad in behalf of
the formidable mr rhodes the square-
jawed mr kent was now turned loose

on war-stricken europe for a holiday
to wander as his somewhat erratic
fancy dictated cheerfully agreeing with
himself that he didnt care a conti-
nental cuss where the renowned john
rhodes was what he was doing what
he wanted to do or what he did all
that mr kent the agent desired was
that mr rhodes the financier should
leave him mr kent undisturbed

  john rhodes said kent to him-
self has bossed me around and run me
here and there like a small boy hopping
a cat over hurdles in the cellar until
im sick and tired of it hes paid me
well and im fairly well off but ive
sure earned every cent i ever got out
of him hes gone on a long vacation
so shall i and if john rhodes doesnt
like it he can go-further

mr rhodes disappearance was
noted mr kents wasnt watch-
ful financiers rumored it that mr
rhodes was traveling in the far east
intent on new plunder but about mr
kent there were no rumors at all and


the blue book magazine

for the simplest of reason-kent had
hopped completely beyond the reach of
rumor had hopped almost out of the
known world beyond finance railways
automobiles and state highways into
the unknown unchanging sixteenth-
century village of steinweg accom-
panied only bv his factotum ivan who
for years had gone with him every-
where he had found in steinweg his
two great objects fish and freedom

  probably kent would not have
admitted any sentimental or artistic
interest in the quaint village itself with
its single crooked street lined by
houses whose gables seemed forever to
reach across and whisper of conspira-
cies the next robber-baron raid or the
public flaying of some poor wretch
accused of stealing a purse or a ham
he might have admitted the comfort
within the old houses once one had
passed through the low doors to the
cool interiors where low ceilings heavy
beams ancient fireplaces blackened
wainscotings and all were lighted by
die cross shadows cast through the tiny
leaded panes of the narrow windows
this would have been his excuse for
renting one of those quaint houses in
the quaint street-renting it and all it
contained including the aged but com-
petent widow who owned it proof of
his daring it requires rerve to rent
a widow although anybody can rent a
house

  kent wished to be free obscure and
unmolested and within a month he
must have been gratified for he had
been accepted as a part of the village
like the village forge the shabby little
priest or the town-pump none sus-
pected that within his uncommunicative
mind were concealed the methods by
which so many of the old-new or new-
old states had been financed

  but not so with ivan he commanded
an uncanny interest-couldnt avoid it
bccause of his enormous size strength
and agility and beeausc of his strange
manner of ignoring all sounds and of
speaking only to those who faced him
in the light

visualization is necessary to
attract the attention of the unimag-
inative and without visualization they

have small interest hence on a certain
night in steinweg no one had even the
slightest curiosity in either the widow
mr kent or ivan because it stormed-
stormed as it can in those mountains
with sweeping rain vivid lightning and
violent thunder the villagers were
inside and under cover on that turbu-
lent night of late spring so were kent
financial agent on a holiday and his
factotum ivan

  kent lounged in the room he had con-
verted into a den and luxuriously stuck
his feet carpet-slippered toward the
fireplace wherein surged a blaze that
robbed the spring dampness of a winter
chill in the comer of the room the
uniform and blackened wainscoting of
which kent had with his own hands
desecrated by building a makeshift
bookcase ivan knelt his huge shoul-
ders were bent forward and his shock
head was stretched turtle-wise as he
sought patiently and laboriously along
the well-packed shelves for a book that
the widow had replaced in her cus-
tomary hit-or-miss fashion suddenly
an interior door was jerked open and
the widow appeared holding her work-
gnarled hands upward and rolling her
eyes with fright

  i hope it struck the catholic
church  she exclaimed im a lu-
theran

  she paused to look backward over
her shoulder as if afraid the thunder-
bolt had legs and might be chasing her
and then suddenly discovering that she
was safe made garrulity serve for
apology

  it isnt often that we have such
weather here it isnt the sides of the
house are waterfalls the streets a
river the garden a lake i was afraid
the pig would drown i brought him
into the kitchen

  very humane of you commented
kent dryly

  another crash of thunder and flash
of light so close as to be simultaneous
caused her to throw her arms above her
head as if to protect it ivan did not
sn much as raise his eyes his imper-
turbability exasperated her

  i tell you she exclaimed pointing
a declamatory finger at ivan hes not
natural sometimes he doesnt answer
the unknown mr kent



when a body speaks to him something
uncanny about him and-and i dont
like it

  there is something wrong with
him kent checked her he cant
hear deaf as an adder or a bad mans
conscience

  her look of incredulity her sniff
were equivalent to disputing her em-
ployers word he thought best to
explain

  listen he said i dont want you
to dislike him he cant help it when
he was a young man he had spinal
meningitis it left him deaf before
that he was a tutor of languages he
taught me all i know and so i shall
always keep him he can tell what you
say to him only by watching your lips-
lip-reading we call it in english i
want you and everyone else to be kind
to him because hes sensitive

  she shook her head doubtfully but
won over by natural sympathy she
said i see hes your three-legged
dog-no good but you keep him be-
cause he loves you

ient tried to discourage her limber-
ness of tongue by picking up a
book but she talked unceasingly while
heaping more fagots around the back-
log and dusting the ashes from the
grate her voice raised to a snap
brought him back from a reverie

  youve not heard a word i said
she declared vastly annoyed

  eh whats that he lifted his
eyes and placated her with a smile that
was rare and winning

  a man came from marken she
repeated intent on impressing him with
prodigious news pierre la franz it
was and says there might be a revolu-
tion over there that will shake the
world shake the world pierre
said

  kent could not restrain a laugh

  dont you bother about the world
he said soothingly markens stand-
ing army might give the popes swiss
guard a good tussle but-humph if
marken went to war the world would
probably never hear of it-let alone
shake why markens so small its a
secret

  as he proceeded she reddened with

indignation tried to speak and then
wagging her head at the obtuseness of
a man who could not believe that the
two-by-four kingdom bordering on
steinweg and regarded with awe by
every peasant within forty miles was
not of world-wide importance she re-
tired to her kitchen she slammed the
door with a fine expression of disgust
but kent was already thoughtfully
recalling what she had said of that
inconspicuous but completely independ-
ent kingdom called marken a king-
dom so small that on a map of europe
it would be but a tiny pink spot a king-
dom so small that no one had ever taken
the trouble to upset it

 his face became grave and he
emitted a disgruntled humph  john
rhodes was again intruding on his
peace of mind and could not be put
aside marken threatening revolt
that meant that the loan of five million
dollars that rhodes had extended to
his majesty karl ii king of marken
might prove worthless and kent had
met the negotiators of that loan passed
upon their securities-accepted them and
caused that loan to be made hang
rhodes  he could afford to lose many
times that sum but the question of the
wisdom of his agent kent was involved
and a financial agents judgment is hi
sole stock in trade now marken
might prove a slap at kents judgment
rhodes wouldnt like it and there
were many other agents who-

  kent twisted his big capable fingers
together and muttered some unpleasant
objurgations consigning karl ii the
marken loan and john rhodes indis-
criminately to the outer world it was
his plain duty as he was well aware
to travel without delay to marken and
do what he could to protect rhodes
interests that might mean the end of
this vacation and the trout were at
their best

scowling kent turned to his
desk unlocked a drawer took there-
from a steel dispatch-box unlocked
that and sought a paper which he
opened and scanned it was a private
report he had caused to be made on
marken affairs and now that its sub-
stance was recalled and his memory


the blue book magazine

refreshed it did not appear to add to
his mental comfort he used one or
two very vigorous americanisms and
replaced paper and bo in the desk he
thumped vigorously on the floor with
his heel and when the huge man in the
comer feeling the shock looked up
addressed him in a voicelt s whisper of
the lips

  ivan have you happened to learn

anything about a revolt over in
marken you see more of these
tongue-wagging peasants than i do

  the giant advanced to the desk
across which he spoke

  no sir not exactly a revolution but
i heard they were discontented over
there some of the villagers said-you
know it is an autocratic government 
yes autocratic government with a
man bom to the job who doesnt hap-
pen to be a real good all-wool-and-a-
yard-wide autocrat good deal like a
fellow being bom to inherit a farm
whose nearest idea of a plow is an ice-
soraper for cocktails

  while kent spoke ivans eyes were
fixed on his lips attentively but dis-
cerning that his employers speech was
at an end he slowly wagged his
massive head and added all his infor-
mation 

  they say sir that the king is cred-
ited with being a well-meaning man
but not just tne one to advance the
kingdom they are afraid marken will
be swallowed by some of the big fish
around it

  thats where an autocrat comes in
declared kent a first-class autocrat
ought to be a big enough fish to get out
and under the guise of charity culture
or some other bosh like that swallow
the other fellow first any sort of an
excuse will do just so he eats them
dead or alive im rather a believer in
autocrats myself now if t were ad-
vising karl the second id say-

  he stopped abruptly interrupted by
a prolonged peal of thunder and when
it died away there became audible a ter-
rific bumping and thumping on the door
outside as some one knocked for
ingress at the same moment the door
from the kitchen opened hurriedly and
the gnarled widow entered

 some one wants in-some one

who raps on the outside door she

grumbled

  well let them in said kent and
ivan reading his lips straightened up
and stepped backward to his comer
intent on withdrawing himself now
that others desired audience with his
employer

chapter ii

the widow opened the door lead-
ing from the room to the little
storm entrance a mere square of
vestibule and withdrew the bolts from
the outer door she swung it wide and
stepped back instantly as if already
rendered impatient by the delay a man
stepped inside a long raincoat dripped
water on the floor and the visor of his
military cap trickled until annoyed he
jerked it from his head and wiped his
brow until his hand he appeared to
be scarcely more than thirty years of
age though of slender frame he had
an erect carriage that lent him a false
dimension of height

  close behind him crowded a burly
gray-haired man with fierce mustaches
demanding more attention than any
other part of his face who pursed his
lips and blew the water from this
adornment with a single loud explosive
poof his eyes round pale and
staring almost childlike but appraising
fixed themselves on kent across his
leaders shoulder and at sight of them
kent who had looked up with casual
curiosity smiled slightly and arose

  we are sorry to disturb you said
the younger man in apologetic french
hut we failed to find an inn yours
was the only light gan you direct

  there is no inn open at this hour
we can perhaps accommodate you
kent replied and ivan reading his
lips lifted his eyebrows knowing that
within less than a quarter of a mile was
an inn of late habit though excellent
repute

  then- the young man turned
dejectedly as if to consult his com-
panion while kent watched him

  perhaps suggested kent you
could be comfortable here-you and
your friend youre welcome
the unknown mr kent



  ivan wondered at his masters
pertinacity

  but her high-that is my sister
and her maid are outside the younger
man said with faint eagerness my
sister and her maid and the man who-
their chauffeur can you provide for
so many

  easily if you dont mind a little
discomfort was the instant response
bring them in dont keep them out
there in the rain

  the elder man with a grunt swung
round and reopened the door of the
vestibule through which his compan-
ion as if too relieved to think for the
moment of offering thanks preceded
him out into the storm

  you said there was no inn indig-
nantly remonstrated the old peasant
woman you said that-

  sh kent silenced her with
twinkling eyes forget that he said
quietly all you are to do is to see
that they are made comfortable un-
derstand grumbling but obedient
and more or less subjugated she turned
back toward her kitchen just as the
outer door opened and through it
stepped a young woman who without
hesitation walked to the fire and with
gloved fingers fumbling at the buttons
of her coat doffed it with an air of
satisfaction exposing a graceful well-
rounded figure clad in a serviceable
tailored costume kent watching her
and ignored saw that her fine eyes were
somber and absent as if her mind were
concentrated on something other than
her surroundings and that her hands
when ungloved and lifted with feminine
habitude to adjust her disordered
exquisite hair were white and graceful
her features were refined sensitive
well bred and of strength her lips
grave and compressed made him won-
der what they might be like when
relaxed by laughter

dehind her came a most haughty
personage carrying a jewel-case
nothing save the fact that she carried
it indicated that this might be the maid
and the other the mistress

  well said the lady with the box
addressing him abruptly cant you
offer a chair

  she fixed kent with a haughty stare
and he realizing that in his inspection
of his new guest he had forgotten to be
polite hastened to make amends

  pardon me he said lamely i
forget

  he drew two chairs toward the fire-
place and was then aware that during
his ministrations the door had opened
and another young man had entered
carrying a suit-case and handbag this
kent decided eying the visitors long
gauntleted gloves was the chauffeur
the latter carefully deposited the
luggage out of the way at one side
removed his cap and stood by the door
he appeared to be the youngest of the
party and was clean and fearless of
face and eyes kent the student of
men mentally appraising him con-
cluded that he liked the young man as
one who could be depended upon in
almost any emergency

  kent however had scant time for
his inspection for the door from the
vestibule again swung open and the two
men who had first disturbed him
appeared closed the door after them
and divested themselves of their rain-
coats the younger man evidently the
leader of the party was clad in the uni-
form of an officer of hussars from
which the shoulder insignia was miss-
ing and his high boot-tops were here
and there splattered with mud proof
that his ride had been far from lei-
surely one of the frogs of his coat-
braid had been torn loose and dangled
by a thread as if it had been ripped
away in the haste of fastening it and
one of his spurs was missing he fum-
bled absently at his belt unfastened it
and threw belt and sword carelessly on
top of the suit-case before turning
toward the fire

  the stout and elderly man was far
from being as neat in his attire being
clad in a rather startling mixture con-
sisting of a pair of dress trousers
tucked into cavalry boots a dress waist-
coat exposing a soiled dress-shirt-front
and a heavy hunting coat from each
pocket of which protruded letters and
papers crammed in hastily around
his portly waist was strapped a cavalry
saber and mixed with the papers in one
pocket of his coat projected the handle

of a huge revolver before he was
clear of his rain-coat he began roaring
orders like an important guest newly
arrived at an inn

  here woman he called to the
aged peasant dame have some one
take our horses to a stable rub them
down water and feed them-not too
much mind you and you might take
these rain-coats out and clean the mud
off the skirts and bring us all some-
thing hot to drink quickly were
half frozen and wet to our hearts

jfith considerable resentment the
w widow faced kent as if accepting
orders from none other and he smiling
sardonically made a swift gesture com-
manding her to obey she tilted her
nose high in the air tossed her head
and disappeared the younger man in
the meantime with an air of great
weariness and dejection dropped into
a chair by the side of the fireplace
where he suddenly leaned forward
until his elbows rested on his knees
and held his white well-kept hands
toward the blaze on one of his fingers
was a huge old signet ring that now and
then he absently twisted in distraction
while moodily staring in front of
him

  kent finding himself still ignored
smiled knowingly and reoccupied his
chair by the desk where he pretended
to absorb himself in a book ivan
taking the cue from his master resumed
his search of the bookshelves as if
receiving unexpected guests on such a
night were a regular routine and the
young officer by the door on an invita-
tion from the leader of the group
joined the others by the fireplace in an
attitude of respectful waiting

  well we are this far and- began
the elder man in his booming french
and then recalling that they were not
alone turned stiffly and stared at kent
made a significant gesture of warning
with liis hand and changed to a dialect
language that was plainly a mixture of
german french and italian in qual-
ity had he been observing the finan-
cial agent he might have been startled
by another flicker of a smile on that
absorbed gentlemans features-due to
the fact that kent the polyglot spoke

 the language of marken almost as

 fluently as he did his own tongue

   and a close call it was too your
 majesty it was very fortunate that i
 had the foresight to divert them from
 following captain paulo across the
 border by-

   the king of marken interrupted him
 impatiently

  your foresight humph it
 seems to me that if your foresight
  as chancellor of my kingdom had
 amounted to much we should never
 have been compelled to run like a hutch
 of rabbits to save our lives however
 my sister is safe he concluded and
 then observing that the acting chauf-
 feur captain paulo appeared restlessly
 eager to speak he added what is it
 paulo

   does it not seem best sire that t
 stand guard outside the door for at
 least an hour or two to make certain we
 are not pursued even here across the
 border we are but an hours ride
 from-

   he hesitated the king vented a
 short bitter laugh

   go ahead he said what you
 mean to say is that our cousin baron
 provarsk is not the sort to pay much
 attention to boundaries on a dark night
 when out for a chase

    exactly sire

   then do as you wish the king
 assented with a shrug of his shoul-
 ders and a gesture of helplessness
 instantly and with an air of willing-
 ness the young officer saluted and
 passed outside to stand guard in the
 storm

   karl i cannot yet see the sense of
 all this asserted the princess who up
 to now had not spoken and kent
 caught himself starting at the musical
 sound of her voice

   but your royal highness blurted
 the chancellor it would have been
 extremely dangerous for you to remain
 there i foresaw that and being a man
 of action i-

 lie paused interrupted by the open-

 	 ing of the door from the kitchen
 and the appearance of the peasant
 woman wearing draped about her head
 and shoulders a gunny-sack that she
the unknown mr kent



had used to protect herself from the
rain she glared haughtily at the visit-
ors and spoke directly to kent the only
one she acknowledged as her master

  i have put the horses in the wood-
shed she announced that fool
peter helped he is feeding them now
the poor beasts scandalous i call
it to ride animals so hard on such a
night 

  kent smiled at her tolerantly

  that being done he said you will
now prepare the best chamber for our
lady guests make it comfortable in
every way you can after that do the
best you can with other rooms

  the ladys maid as if to assure her-
self of the princess comfort arose
saying i will help you please lead
the way and when the peasant woman
disappeared followed her kent after
a glance at his guests-who as if too
dejected to be interested in anything
save their own plight still stared at the
fire-again resumed his pretense of
reading now and then his bushy eye-
brows tightened and his mouth took on
a grim firm look as if he were slowly
threshing his way toward a resolution
but his guests evidently feeling safe
behind the barrier of their language
again took up their conversation

  what i fail to understand despite
your somewhat lame explanations von
glutz remarked the king with asper-
ity is how provarsk could have
hatched his plot and taken possession
of the palace before you suspected it

  a chancellor cannot see every-
thing doggedly grumbled von glutz
and you will remember sire that it
was you who did away with our secret
service

  bah why not it accomplished
nothing and cost much to keep

  now when your father was alive
under whom you must not forget i had
the extreme honor to act as chancel-
lor- began von glutz crustily and
pompously

  yes father willed you to us inter-
jected the princess with acerbity

 the chancellor said humph
hum-m noisily and then having
cleared his throat preparatory to speak-
ing contented himself by getting
extremely red in the face opening his

lips closing them and tugging at his
white mustache

  and things went from bad to worse
regardless of all  wanted to do for my
people the king spoke with a voice
of regret and sorrow

  this evidence of sincerity appeared
to be the final spur necessary to bring
kent to a decision he turned slowly
around and stared hard at the young
man then he abruptly closed his book
tossed it on the table and said address-
ing him in the tongue of marken and
so abandoning your good intentions
you ran away eh

the falling of one of the beams of
the ceiling could scarcely have
proved more startling to the three refu-
gees by the fireplace the king pivoted
in his chair and faced kent with a look
of consternation the princess aghast
opened her eyes widely and the chan-
cellor bristling with annoyance jumped
to his feet and roared loudly what
business have you listening do you
know whom you are addressing

  to a man who throughout his life
had been accustomed to see his hearers
quail when he vented that tremendous
roar the effect was more than disap-
pointing the roar seemed to have lost
its efficacy for the financial agent
merely grinned at him and snapped his
fingers he even had the temerity to
eye the chancellor slowly from his
round eyes down to the tips of his
boots and then back up again almost
contemptuously but with infinite good
nature yet there was a something
about him suggesting that he might
grin just as pleasantly if he were order-
ing the chancellor taken out to the
hen-house and hanged by his fat neck

  suppose you drop that style of talk
with me he said at last and sit down
like a good boy certainly i know
whom i address otherwise-humph

i	dont think id take the trouble this
pleasant little party consists first of
her royal highness princess eloise
second of his majesty karl second
king of marken and third of his
excellency that clever astute and far-
sighted chancellor baron von glutz

  he chuckled softly as the chancellor
writhed under his sarcasm stuttered


the blue book magazine

and threatened apoplexy and then
kent added with a soft drawl that even
the language of marken could not hide 
dont trouble to speak baron if it
hurts you i undoubtedly have the
advantage of you in this that while
you dont know who i am which after
all matters but little i know all about
vou

 you-you-you impudence i call
it how dare you-

  easy easy baron kent admon-
ished with much of the good nature
vanishing from his eyes and his firm
mouth adusting itself to harshness
best not make a fool of yourself
you have my permission to scowl at
me perhaps its just as well so that
in future meetings if there are any you
can identify me quickly and thus leam
to suppress what i fear is a rather
truculent temper

the king who had watched kent
closely evidently had greater con-
trol of his emotions and faced his
chancellor sharply

   baron sit down he said quietly
we are not in a position to domineer
you forget yourself we are this gen-
tlemans guests-although as he says
he has an advantage of knowledge
kent refused to accept this sugges-
tion that he make himself known turn-
ing to his desk and the steel dispatch-
box which he had opened he took there-
from a packet of papers that rustled as
he spread them before him

  that there may be no further doubt
of my knowledge he said dryly and
that you may realize how thoroughly 
do know you i ask you kindly to listen
while i read

  the face of the princess expressed
nothing save expectancy while the
king watched his strange host with a
look of curiosity the chancellor sub-
dued momentarily by the command of
his superior fidgeted and moved rest-
lessly in his chair

  without preliminary kent read
slowly distinctly as if to impress his
words upon them but in rather a kindly
tone of tolerance

    tn obedience to your request for a
thorough report i submit as follows
after some six weeks study of the situ-

ation i may add his majesty karl

ii	is in character a well-meaning

morally clean young man he has
neither bad nor extravagant habits
there is small doubt that he cares for
his people and has at all times their
welfare at heart his unfortunate
failing is that he clings to the
old monarchical ideas but without
the strength and firmness to enforce
them upon his subjects and thereby con-
trol them he may possibly have the
courage to face the issues that are cer-
tain to confront him as a ruler but i
am inclined to doubt it he is too
kindly disposed and is given to the
evasion of those harsh or unpleasant
duties the prompt meeting and decid-
ing of which can alone make his reign
a success i had not the means of
studying him very closely and there-
fore may be mistaken yet i cannot
help but regard him until he proves
otherwise as what is termed a
slacker 

lent paused and looked up at the
king who bit his lip frowned
thoughtfully and said quietly it is
the truth

   the princess gazed at her brother
angrily and urged him to speak in his
own defense

   karl karl she demanded indig-
nantly are you going to sit here and
let a stranger dare criticise you in this
manner

   if the princess will but listen-
kent began politely and with an air of
deference hut he was interrupted by
the chancellor who again blustered un-
til he wag silenced-and that too with-
out politeness or deference

   suppose baron you keep out of
this kents voice was stem albeit
satirical no no wait a moment and
ill give you an excuse to talk the best
part of this report deals with you and
no doubt an outside appraisal of your
character might prove interesting

   i-ie flipped the pages over rapidly
paying no heed to the chancellors
angry protests until he interrupted
with a dry here we are and again
lead aloud  chancellor von glutz is
in person a large pot-bellied man with
a bulbous red nose eyes like a golli-
the unknown mr kent



wogs given to boasting overeating
and arrogance who has a vastly exalted
opinion of himself and is in reality a
man of but mediocre ability steady
steady baron ive not finished
yes do be quiet insisted the king
with a slight grin of satisfaction

   it is largely due to his incom-
petence and pigheadedness that the
kingdom is secretly in a state of unrest
at the time of rendering this report
but it is doubtful if the king will dis-
miss him from office inasmuch as the
baron is a sort of family heirloom i
find nothing to his credit save that he is
bluntly honest and loyal 

  there you are baron the king
laughed but the chancellor after gasp-
ing like a large and overfat codfish
hauled from deep water was now on
his feet bristling with rage his eyes
completely round and blazing his
mustaches quivering his face red and
his fist clenched and threatening assault
on kent-who grinned cheerfully and
said in english hoity-toity got a
rise out of you that time you old por-
poise 

  by what right i demand to know
shouted the baron did you dare to
send a detective to marken you have
gone too far even if we do have to ac-
cept you as host by what right sir
answer me

  kents bushy eyebrows closed in a
heavy frown and all tolerance and good
humor disappeared even his voice
underwent a subtle change and became
frigid and emphatic his eyes coldly
met and held those of the chancellor

  if anyone had the right to investi-
gate the procedure by which you and
your king between you blotched up
the affairs of marken  am that man
lets be done with paltering flattery
and rubbish and talk plainly i hap-
pen to be richard kent who as con-
fidential agent for john rhodes gave
the unfortunate advice by which he ad-
vanced five million dollars in gold to
start karl the second just come to the
throne free from other debt oh i
had right enough

if touched by an electric spark
the king arose from his chsiir
stared for an instant and then slowly

dropped back again with a long sigh of
resignation von glutz breathed heav-
ily through his nose and appeared to
wilt into an equal state of help-
lessness there was a moments
silence in which kent sternly eyed him
and then a voice broke out filled with
anger and defiance that of the prin-
cess eloise

  and so she said scornfully the
vultures gather on the borders waiting
to fatten from our misfortunes
mademoiselle-your royal high-
ness  y ou-

  she swept his attempted defense
aside with an eloquent gesture

  john rhodes the nightmare that
has been over our heads for four

fat from the misfortunes of nations of
peoples of private enterprises the
gigantic spider that crouched behind
the war waiting that he might plunge
forward with money and twist his prey
harder than ever shylock clutched
and hung to his pitiable victims and
you have the effrontery-to tell us here
to-night when we are your reluctant
guests with everything lost behind us
that you are the agent of the infamous
john rhodes

  kent looked at her in a strange ad-
mixture of annoyance and admiration
here at least was one who was not
afraid his eyes lowered themselves
to the papers on his desk and it was
as if the great john rhodes-before
whom as she said kings and financiers
alike had trembled-was for the first
time being presented to kents mind in
true light

  it is true he said thoughtfully
that i am the agent of john rhodes
but t have not as your royal highness
implies been sent here as a spy iu wait-
ing for your flight-for an abdication
or to make terms for john rhodes
protection my being here is an acci-
dent

che shrugged her shoulders with an
 air of disdain as if expecting a
financial agent to evade or lie it
added to his distress men he under-
stood and could fight he was no

years men might worry and work
but john rhodes interest must be paid
that magnificent usurer who thrives

quaverer he had in his capacity as
agent boldly met and boldy browbeaten
half the chancellories of europe his
nerve and bravery were recognized by
those of far more importance than any-
one connected with this paltry petty
betinseled little kingdom-which liad
survived by accident and the disrup-
tion of which had been delayed by his
own efforts merely because it was the
whim of john rhodes for financial
purposes of his own that it should con-
tinue to exist

  an accident she said mockingly
an accident they are strange such
accidents as these mr richard kent
admits being the financial emissary for
the gentle mr rhodes-rhodes whose
crimes of selfishness and remissness are
greater than those of any man living
who ever heard of john rhodes ever
doing anything to lessen the cares and
sorrows of kingdoms or of peoples
the rothschilds with less power than
this hard-hearted american found
ways to save many but not so rhodes
there was in them a respect for the
dignity of those who had suffered
responsibilities and a desire to assist
those nations that struggled for exist-
ence and because they had endured
were worthy of some respect and vener-
ation  but rhodes the cruel uncanny
and monstrous genius of money had
no such saving grace not even you
his agent can truthfully tell of one un-
selfish and kindly act in his career i
am not afraid to tell you this though
like master like man is a fine old
proverb in your tongue and you have
the temerity to declare that you were
not lying here in wait that you-

  without thought she had advanced
as she tempestuously spoke until she
stood at the end of the desk and he
to meet her approach arose and from
its opposite side stood and looked at
her the king and chancellor in turn
tried to check her but she imperiously
waved them aside

  does not your royal highness
understand objected the chancellor
pleadingly that you are making a
powerful enemy of the only man pos-
sibly who can assist us in the future

  future there is no future she
declared impatiently gesturing the

baron aside but kent who stood al-
most stolidy under her words objected
to interference

  if you please baron he said
steadily i prefer that the princess
have her say she is at least candid
and honest from her at least i shall
not find subterfuge he stepped
around the side of the desk until his
back was to von glutz-and also by the
change he carelessly and impolitely
ignored the king

  i implore your highness to pro-
ceed he said respectfully yet firmly
meeting her eyes there is nothing
that so clarifies the atmosphere of mis-
understandings as freely uttered truths
and mademoiselle-even a money-
lender may be permitted to admire
bravery such as yours i have told you
that my being here was an accident i
told the truth is it fair and just to
believe that i also may not be candid
to condemn me unheard as a liar
neither of us is afraid i listen

cor some reason that she could not

	have analyzed her defiance faltered
and waned there was the protest of
honor affronted in his quiet musical
voice and she suddenly discerned in
this alien some prodigious power some
inflexible strength that hitherto blind-
ed by anger she had not recognized

  what is the need  sne asked
lamely you are in a position to laugh
at our distress a distress that you do
not and cannot understand oh if
i were a man-

  she paused he smiled vaguely at
this sign of femininity

  other women have said that he
declared softly other brave women
-ever since thrones and kings began
it is the most hackneyed cry of crea-
tion and i doubt not that if you
were-

  he turned sharply as the sound of
a door opening disturbed him and
glanced across the room to where the
lady-in-waiting had entered and stood
with her hand upon the latch

  your royal highness apartment
is ready the lady-m-waiting said as
pci functorily as if they were still in a
royal palace and undisturbed the
king arose wearily to his feet and the
the unknown mr kent



chancellor bowed punctiliously before
the princess as she slowly turned and
advanced toward the door she paused
for an instant as if tom by a desire
to speak again hesitated with other
words on her lips and then slowly
passed from sight

chapter iii

the king harassed by his own
misfortunes slowly dropped
back to his seat and resumed
his listless attitude while staring into
the fire that crackled and glowed as a
black-log dropped broken to be con-
sumed in the bed of embers beneath-
symbol of his broken kingdom from
which he had fled the chancellor
diplomatic became obsequious in the
presence of the man who stood as a
possible dictator of destiny stared at
kent and resumed that nervous tugging
at his mustache kent bent from the
hips forward still leaned across the
desk with his eyes fastened absently on
the door through which the princess
had departed

  i hope said the chancellor apolo-
getically that mr kent does not take
too seriously what the princess eloise
has said her royal highness is
exhausted she has endured much to-
night and-at times all of us are worn
to irritability

  abruptly kent scowled at him and
stood erect almost resentfully he
said the princess requires no cham-
pion she appears abundantly able to
fight her own battles-better i might
suggest than some of those stalwarts
around her

  heedless of the chancellors discom-
fiture he walked around the desk and
seated himself with all the air of
energy and business capability that
dominated him when on guard he
folded the scattered papers placed
them in an envelope put them back
into the dispatch - box and then
brusquely turned toward the king

  now that we understand more or
less of the conditions he said coldly
i should like to have you tell me
exactly what happened in marken that
explains your presence here in this vil-

lage you need not hesitate or stand
on your dignity i have talked with
other fallen kings i have made and
unmade some of them he added with
grim significance

  the king looked at him and smiled
almost sadly yet not without dignity
the chancellor after a perplexed and
hesitating glance grunted wiped his
bald head with his handkerchief and
left the task of reply to royalty the
king shrugged his shoulders and his
eyes wandered around the room as he
mentally formulated speech and sought
the true beginning they fell upon
ivan and for the first time he appeared
cognizant of his presence

  perhaps he suggested in the dis-
cussion of a subject so delicate as the
admission of ones own defeats it
would be better if we were alone
kent turned toward ivan he
started to explain the latters affliction
and then checking himself said
quite right it is better if we are
alone

  it flashed through his mind that it
might be as well to humor the king
and also mental habit controlled him
a habit of caution that had grown from
the policy that it was far better never
to tell anything that could remain un-
told he saw that his followers eyes
were on his lips and said ivan you
may go i shall not want you this
evening

  the giant alert in his own world of
silence smiled quietly understanding
all that was implied and turned toward
the door with the lost book in his
hands

  thank you he said if you need
me i shall be in my room

 he bowed to kents guests and
passed out while the king with an air
of relief watched his departure

to

  said the king abruptly
after a minutes silence i tried
to reform and be a father to my people
without giving offense and-made a
mess of it

  kent liked him for the frankness of
his confession and his eyes softened
to a more friendly shade

  his majesty was not- began the
chancellor


the blue book magazine

  suppose you let him tell it inter-
rupted the financier he seems to
have maintained his position as well as
you did yours

  the king lifted his hand palm out-
ward toward the chancellor and it
was quite as effective as if the open
palm had been clapped over the chan-
cellors mouth

  go ahead kent urged the king
you tried reforms and they didnt
succeed most of them dont er-
what particular mania-i mean brand
of reformation was yours anti-
gambling prohibition eugenics
votes for women universal peace
what was it you tried

  at first the king scowled at the
american a good hearty scowl of out-
raged dignity and then discerning
that beneath the banter was more or
less of sympathy he smiled a trifle
sadly

  i tried he said quietly to give
them more liberty

  oh kent let the exclamation
slip and then after a slight pause
i remember that yours was an abso-
lute monarchy always has been
people brought up to respect the king
boisterously when he happened to be
respectable and to swallow their dis-
respect when he happened to be the
other thing may i ask what form of
liberty you proposed was it a magna
charta or something like that

  of course not indignantly ob-
jected the chancellor the rights of
the crown had to be respected

  um-m-mh so sort of curtailed
liberty eh with a leash on it that could
be jerked when necessity arose just
like an april fool purse designed by a
small boy who lurks around the
comer

  i gave them councils where they
could vote protested the king that
was a step toward liberty wasnt it

  but i suppose your very able chan-
cellor saw to it that you could veto any
act they passed and in fact dissolve
them any time they had plans you did
not approve of

the king tried to appear offended
and the chancellor was sulky and
sullen

  did you finally dissolve them
kent asked when neither answered

  no said the king sadly i tried
to reason with them that was after
one of them proposed a resolution invit-
ing me to abdicate

 kent leaned back and laughed
quietly

  listen he said there are just
two ways of reasoning with a man who
tries to throw you out of your own
house if he is big enough to do it
grin and move if he isnt call for the
police or take a club and chase him into
the middle of the next block it ap-
pears they were strong enough to put
you out so-here you are

  no you are wrong disputed the
king it was not the people who
caused me to leave it was my cousin
baron provarsk who wants to rule in
my place and who laughs and snaps
his fingers at any idea of reform

  i rather approve of him kent
volunteered how did he do it

  he has money he gathered a good-
sized band of mercenaries from the
surrounding states w-ithout our know-
ing it surprised the palace to-night
which was easy because i have dis-
ensed with much of a guard and we
ad to escape

  his majesty fails to be explicit
declared the chancellor crustily pro-
varsk would have murdered him
but what i cant understand said
kent is why you didnt fight it out
why you two come mounted why her
royal highness arrives in a car accom-
panied bv a maid and one officer why
didnt all-

  when the attack was made it was
entirely unexpected explained the
king i had not the faintest fear that
any of my subjects would lay hands
on my person i was unable to defend
the palace alone and couldnt escape
and leave my sister there at provarsks
mercy you see sir my sister was also
one of his objects twice he has triea
to marry her it was because i didnt
want her to fall into his clutches that
we ran away we would have re-
mained to fight it out but for her
presence we did hold them off until
captain paulo had succeeded in carry-
ing her away then-well-the chan-
the unknown mr kent



cellor and i mounted led provarsks
followers off in the wrong direction to
give paulo time and rejoined my sister
here at this village

  we fought observed the chancel-
lor as if theirs had been an achieve-
ment scarcely worthy of note we
held them up from door to door and
charged them once in the woods
cutting our way through and back
again

the king nodded agreement and

	kent astonished studied both his
and the chancellors faces as if he had
discovered unexpected cause for com-
mendation

  his majesty made most excellent
swordplay observed the chancellor
we dared not fire lest we bring others
against us

  the king lifted his hand in depre-
cation

  well you did sire insisted the
chancellor

  no more or as much as you
baron protested the king

  i did not mind that so much as the
difficulties of getting her royal high-
ness to assent boomed the chancellor

  my sister explained the king to
the financier is-somewhat difficult
she has-and i dont mean this as dis-
paragement or criticism-quite a will
and temper of her own she rather
stubbornly insisted on all of us remain-
ing and fighting to the deadi
positively refused to recognize the
hopelessness of the odds the chan-
cellor seconded declared she would
go and face them alone which was just
what provarsk would have liked tried
to call for help by telephone but pro-
varsks crew had cut the wires tried
to shoot a man who crawled round the
balcony toward the chamber-but the
pistol wasnt loaded it was very diffi-
cult sir very we had to threaten to
carry her away by force for her own
safety before she would go

  whose task was that

  his majestys

  i should say that too required some
bravery commented the american

  it did assented von glutz grin-
ning dryly and stroking his nose in an
effort to hide his mirth

  and this paulo is kent ques-
tioned

  the captain of the kings guard
which unfortunately consists owing to
his majestys desire to appear demo-
cratic and also to conduct the affairs
of the kingdom with the utmost econ-
omy of barely four-score men of
whom but five are ever on palace duty
provarsk had about fifty followers
he concluded as if to explain how the
palace had been overwhelmed

ient leaned his chin on his hand
and meditated for a time and then
said i dont see how you could have
done anything else than escape from
the palace but why cross the border
there seemed no other direction
open replied the king with a heavy
sigh of discouragement

  but certainly if what i understand
is correct you must have had some
friend who could shelter you until you
could formulate some definite plan
yes but that said the king
might have meant civil war-blood-
shed and i dont want any of my
people killed on my account if they
have decided that the country and their
happiness are more assured by my go-
ing-well-i must go

 what do you think on those
points kent asked the king

  if it were anybody but provarsk-
the latter faltered widi an air of
resignation

  provarsk is a reactionary-a would-
be tyrant-a man who would think no
more of taking one or a hundred lives
than he would of throwing dice for his
castle von glutz roared

  with the natural result that if he
gets into power die people of marken
will at least have a ruler kent re-
torted and quite plainly from my
way of thinking that is what they have
lacked the country has had a king
who widi the best intentions has been
misunderstood firmness was the ele-
ment lacking to like a mans motives
but to doubt his ability- to carry any of
them through is even worse than to
doubt his motives but be certam that
whatever they are he will force them
over a resolute bad man is frequently
better than a vacillating good man 

l
	the blue book magazine

  the king nodded his head and
scowled at the fireplace

  i admit all that-now that it is too

late he said in a hitler monotone

  too late heavens man you dont
mean to tell me that you are brave
enough to cut your way through a band
of murderers in the night after defend-
ing your sister and yet are ready to
abdicate rather than make another fight
for it do you humph

  kents tone conveyed contempt
mixed with wonder

   am not personally afraid of any-
thing sir declared the king nettled
but i do not want and will not have
hundreds perhaps thousands of men
killed on my account after all they
are my people as they have been the
people of my ancestors for hundreds of
years i have conceived it to be my
duty to protect them and their happi-
ness and welfare

  well spoken said kent very
nice theory too but it lacks this much
that quite frequently it is necessary to
compel people to do the right things
for their own happiness for this
reason we sometimes spank boys when
they run away from schools-paddle
them when they yield to the delights of
chewing tobacco and we admonish our
daughters when they go to places of
gayety that they should not enter whip
our dogs when they begin to delight
in snapping at strangers heels and a
thousand and one other things that
make the admonished howl or yelp at
the time but work out for their own
good

 or a moment kent stared in a
kindly way at the king as if
expecting the latter to dispute and then
added grimly if i were in your place
id not let this man provarsk win so
easily id fight

  i would if i knew how the
king spoke impetuously

  but you must have some friend who
can assist you suggested kent some
man you can depend upon

  the king shook his head sadly
there are many who like me he
said but they fear provarsk

  pooh kent accompanied himself
with a snap of his fingers

  if his majesty would run the risk
of a war- began the chancellor

  rubbish exclaimed kent war
nothing the thing to do is to beat him
at his own game see here young man-
i beg your majestys pardon-youve
got to do it youve got to be
one of two things-a king or a coward
youve got to decide to-night too be-
fore the people of marken know that
you have been driven out by provarsk
dont you understand that from to-
night you are either just beginning or
just finished

  if i could see any way on earth
without a civil war declared the king
desperately id try it

  kent studied him closely with steady
eyes-then turned to his desk and con-
sulted a memorandum-book

  im going to be perfectly frank with
you he said at last it doesnt matter
much to me who is the ruler of
marken but i like you for the ideals
you have had and admire your sister
for wishing to stay to the ultimate end
and most of all ive got considerable
at stake in this myseli because john
rhodes hasnt much use for a man who
causes him to lose five million dollars-
and whats more hes a good fighter
he does pretty much as i suggest be-
sides this strikes me as an interesting
proposition and at present i havent
much to do provarsk is promising i
admire him too it requires courage
to do what he has done 

ll e suddenly threw the book back into
 the drawer and shoved the latter
shut with an emphatic bdng he arose
from his chair frowned thoughtfully
at the lampshade then looked across it
at the king

  ill make a bargain with you he
said chopping his sentences you
assist me and ill assist you-under
let us say very peculiar conditions if
you will agree to do exactly as i say
ill either make a real king of you or
give you a chance to die like a man
instead of a runaway and if we fail
well fail together but i shall at least
make an effort to save john rhodes
money and you your throne be cer-
tain of that

  the king looked at him hopefully


the unknown mr kent	

and the chancellor with grudging
respect

   i cant see what else i can do but
listen said the king i am-as you
see what do you propose

   this said kent deliberately that
you are to go back to your country and
fight it out but that you are to fight it
out just as i direct that from now on-
ward until i have recovered the money
john rhodes lent you-which would
naturally mean the clearing of mark-
ens finances and a restoration of peace
and industry-i am to be the absolute
untrammeled dictator of your kingdom
not only that but that you and this
chancellor or any other that i name
are to do exactly as i order im to be
temporarily the tyrant the ruler also
that not a soul on earth besides our-
selves is to know that i am such i
can be anything we wish a visitor at
court or anything that doesnt matter
so long as you and the baron here obey
me implicitly no matter how difficult
my demand

   the king gasped and stared at him as
if fascinated while the chancellor went
red and white by turns both were
speechless at the boldness of his propo-
sition

   come he said in a friendly tone
youve everything to gain and nothing
to lose youve lost all you had both
of you and i believe if you agree to
give me a free hand that we can suc-
ceed administration is after all
largely a matter of finance further-
more if you do not agree to this i am
compelled to take steps immediately to
ally myself with provarsk the insur-
gent for the protection of that loan
which i caused to be made and which
i represent hence after to-night i
shall be either your friend or your
enemy no halfway measures with me
i must be one or the other squarely
uncompromisingly you must de-
cide

tthe king settled back into his chair
 and appeared to hesitate and con-
sider while the chancellor fixed his
stare on the floor greatly perturbed and
quite helpless the old clock in the
corner ticked heavily and the rain
lashed the windows audibly as if wait-

ing outside the room were enemies
defiant and challenging onslaught the
american slowly opened his strong-box
a second time selected some papers
with care and handed them to the king

   i hat there may be no doubt in your
mind that i am the original man who
made the loan to your government and
that i am empowered by john rhodes
to act as i deem best you will please
read these they will serve as creden-
tials

  he handed the papers to the king
who read them and handed them back
-but with an increased look of respect
in his eyes his gaze shifted back to
the chancellor plainly he was hesi-
tating-yet devoid of funds or other
plans an exile tempted to plunge

  if you were out of money why
didnt you sell those manganese mines
you own or a concession on them for a
number of years kent asked the
king as if by afterthought

  because i could conceive of no one
being fool enough to offer me such a
sum for a concession replied the
king it would require more capital
or labor than i can produce to make
them pay

  kent stared speculatively at him and
took a turn through the room

  im not certain that i wouldnt be
foolish enough to try it he said
thoughtfully ive been well informed
that they are valuable why not grant
me a twenty-year concession out of
which i give you ten per cent of the
profit-but with this clear agreement
that i am to have full power to handle
you and your kingdom to make them
pay its the only way i car find to
save rhodes money for him

  the king looked tempted yet
cautiously considerate he did not
answer in haste

is ent paced the room thoughtfully
and at last with a kindly air
walked across and laid his hand on the
kings shoulder

  you are not a king to me he said
quietly you are just a fine brave
young fellow with high ideals who
deserves a chance i hate to see as
decent a young chap as you are fail
irretrievably for the want of some one


the blue book magazine

to back him and to show him the way
through we dont have kings in my
country but we have the young fel-
lows and i have helped a lot of them
when about all they needed was some
one to pat them on the back and say
its all right boy youre not licked
yet get up and try again and
most always they take heart and go in
and win thats what i want you to
do go in and win your duty is to
be a king and i now tell you go and
be one if youll do as i say-well
provarsk is much abler than i think
he is if we dont beat him hand and
foot in any event he shall have a
struggle that will make him about the
busiest usurper that ever tried for a
throne

  the king trained to repress display
of emotions since childhood and passed
through the course which makes of
princes wooden-faced images forgot all
that education as the american pro-
gressed and became merely a desper-
ately hurt human being craving friend-
ship and support his lip twitched and
strained under this unexpected tender
of sympathy for a long time he still
weighed the situation with all its
alternatives asking now and then
cautious questions and receiving re-
assuring answers at last quite like
one taking a final and desperate
chance he made his decision he rose
to his feet as befitted the gravity of
the situation and said very simply i
accept the concession is yours and
i put myself completely in your hands
because i trust you and because i have
no other recourse our agreement is
one of honor to last until you have
secured your superiors money or by
your own word release me from further
obligation

  that is fair very fair kent replied
with equal gravity and you may
trust me to make my stay as brief as
possible because ive no wish for the
job he paused a minute and added
with one of his rare smiles you see
the fact is i never have run a kingdom
before once when i was young i ran
a sawmill and after all running king-
doms and sawmills is not much dif-
ferent both consist in seeing that the
work is well done

the king extended his hand to the
financial agent who took it and
for an instant held it and studied the
kings face as if to make a last
appraisement of this material with
which he must work

  and i take it that the chancel-
lor-

  for more than twenty years as
boy and man von glutz rumbled i
have served the house of his majesty
and behind me are four generations
of my name who have also given all
they had to give i ask nothing but to
serve the kings wish is to me an
order

  phew thats going some takes
me back to a gallery seat at the melo-
drama kent said in english much
to the chancellors bewilderment but
with the chancellor too the american
shook hands as if this were to seal a
binding contract and then almost
abruptly he swung round to his desk
seated himself and was the man in
command his head appeared to set
more doggedly his voice to become
more crisp and authoritative

  ill take your word for the conces-
sion until we can draw it up now who
is this friend of whom you spoke he
asked the king

  baron von hertz distantly related
who dwells most of the time in a
medieval castle he has rehabilitated
it is less than ten miles from marken

  and you can depend on him

  implicitly on him and all his
followers and tenants

  and how far is his castle from
here

  about thirty miles i should
think

   all right we shall have to use the
car the princess arrived in we three
will start at once

  and leave my sister here alone-
undefended

  kent stepped to the door and turned
back to answer over his shoulder

  no i shall leave my man ivan to
guard her she will be as safe as if
we three were here

lie was gone from the room but a
 few minutes and when he returned
was clad in a heavy rain-coat and
the unknown mr kent



carried in his hand a light sporting rifle
he was very brusque and determined
in the directness with which he crossed
the room possessed himself of a maga-
zine pistol examined the clip to make
certain that it was filled and gave an
order that was entirely devoid of
deference you will now call in cap-
tain paulo and instruct him he
said also there must be no forgetful-
ness of our relative positions you
are now and hereafter to be my mouth-
piece you are still the king you
will give such orders as i give you as
your own obey my instructions and
see that they are carried out as if they
were your own you understand
thoroughly 

  both the king and chancellor bowed
the latter with a quick military salute
of acquiescence

  summon captain paulo said the
king acccpting his new role and
when in answer to the stentorian hail
of the chancellor through the lattice
the officer appeared the king com-
manded evenly as if nothing unusual
could be found in the situation cap-
tain paulo bring the car around to the
door headed in the opposite direction
we return to our kingdom

  the officers youthful face flashed to
exultation almost he voiced it but
recovered and saluted while his eyes
danced with satisfaction he would
have turned to obey but the king
restrained him

  just a moment paulo he said
mr kent accompanies us and will re-
main with us for some time it is my
wish that you obey anything he asks
as you would me do you know the
road from here to the castle hertz

  quite well sire

  then it is there that you are to take
us

  kent gave his first direct order to
the officer a few minutes later as the
three men climbed into the car

  drive he said drive like the
devil

  and the car with big headlights
ablaze roared its way down the village
street skidded as it made a sharp turn
and then leaped out on a long straight
road like a racer on the home stretch
reaching for a goal

chapter iv

for what seemed to kent a long
and perilous time the car jolted
and slipped and ran at a fearsome
speed over long level stretches up hills
and over mountain roads at last it
rushed noisily up a harsh incline and
across what he surmised had once been
a moat-bridge to come to a halt in a
courtyard where it stood and steamed
like a spent racer finishing a course

  well whats wanted

  a watchman flashing an clectric
torch challenged them and they
climbed out to observe that the storm
was abating that off on one horizon
stars were shining through a cloud-
opening and that they stood in front
of a huge and gloomy old pile that
kent knew could be nothing but the
castle hertz

  the baron is within asked the
chancellor

  without a doubt and asleep as
such an honest man should be was the
watchmans surly response

  he must be aroused grunted the
chancellor

  not by me exclaimed the watch-
man im an old man with a family
dependent on me cant you gentlemen
wait until morning

  you go and tell your master
that- von glutz began in a hoarse
bluster but was quietly elbowed aside
by the american who continued the
sentence as if it were his own

  that three gentlemen have called
here in the most urgent haste and can-
not be delayed also that we are on
the kings business here this mav
help

  he slipped into the watchmans hand
a gold coin which the latter took
inspected under the light of the torch
hit to make certain that he was not
dreaming and acknowledged by doffing
his cap and bowing very deeply

  it must be on the kings business
he declared no one else could possi-
bly have that much money in these
times sir ill take a chance

  wonderful what one can accom-
plish by diplomacy kent remarked
dryly as the watchman ambled around
to a side entrance and disappeared


the blue book magazine

along wait ensued which indi-
cated either that the baron von
hertz might have been hard to awaken
or had calmly murdered his watchman
and returned to his repose then
when kent was beginning to be
annoyed a huge door in front of them
opened a light glowed within and they
were invited to enter

  i trust observed the watchman
meaningly as he conducted them
toward a waiting-room that you gen-
tlemen are really on the kings business
otherwise i fear that my lord the
baron will prove-a trifle unpleasant
at first he swore that he wouldnt get
up for the king himself it was not
until i suggested you might be robbers
and there was a prospect of a good
fight that he consented to arise he is
now loading his shotgun pray be
seated

  must be a pleasant old chap said
kent with a soft chuckle

  but the king failing to see any
humor in the situation threw himself
wearily into a chair without removing
his hat or coat and stretched his legs
in front of him and stared at his boots
the watchman took his post outside the
doorway kent was calmly inspecting
the room when he was disturbed by a
sharp ahem in the doorway and
looked around to discover a tall gaunt
white-whiskered old gentleman whose
bald head was protected by a flaming
red nightcap and who carried a heavy
fowling piece in dexterous habitude
that suggested he might be perfectly
willing to use it on slight provocation
the three visitors rose and for a
moment he glared at them then enter-
ing the room he hastily deposited the
shotgun in a corner turned his head
and bawled to the watchman its all
right go on outside and watch the
weather for a while im expecting a
hailstorm

  after that he came quickly forward
and offered both hands to his sov-
ereign

  well karl what is up now what
brings you here at this time of night
some one been lifting the lid to let the
sulphur out

  provarsk replied the king sen-
tentiously

  the old man smiled a wry smile
nodded to von glutz and favored
kent with a harsh stare from under his

scowling eyebrows

  its all right said the king we 
can talk freely this is an american
gentleman mr kent who is the
agent for john rhodes the financial
magnate

   oh cant he collect interest in
daylight demanded the irascible old
man since when did you begin to
make night journeys with money-
lenders 

  kent stood unmoved but the king
rushed to his defense

  baron he asserted steadily mr
kent has proved to be my friend as
such i am certain you will regard
him

  pardon me the american inter-
jected  i do not seek the barons
friendship

defore the amazed old nobleman
could recover kent walked directly
across the intervening space until he
confronted him

  whether you like me or not
whether you object to me or not my
lord baron is to me of the very slight-
est importance there is but one atti-
tude i expect from you that which
is current between gentlemen and
which consists of courtesy that i
demand

  there was an intense stillness in the
room as they eyed each other kent
inflexible the king distressed the chan-
cellor open-mouthed at such uncom-
promising words the old baron was
the most affected and stood as if stupe-
fied with astonishment for a pregnant
time he met kents stare and then
suddenly chuckled in his throat with a
queer wise acceptance he turned to
the king and exploded much as an
explorer might have done on announc-
ing a discovery why karl youve
got a friend who is a man by saint
dominique this is a man

  the chancellor twisted and frowned

the caustic inference was not lost upon
him but he had no opportunity for
speech for the baron advanced to
the american put out his hand and
exclaimed my kinsman needs a few

il-j
the unknown mr kent



like you it should straighten affairs
out unless i mistake

pr a time they stood and eyed each
other the one stalwart in developed
strength the other elderly weak-and
wise

  i have placed myself at the kings
disposal kent said then mollified
and that is one of the reasons why we
are here we now seem to understand
one another his majesty himself will
tell you what has happened in marken
he seeks a friend he has come to
you

  he turned to the king as did the
baron and they seated themselves
around a tete-a-tete table that stood
conveniently in a corner of the room
without evasion the king told the
baron all that had taken place observ-
ing his promise to kent that nothing
should be said of their private agree-
ment

  i have undertaken explained the
american to assist his majesty in
the difficulty by advice and further-
more i am in a position to command for
him substantial financial support in our
enterprise

  his three auditors alike exposed their
surprise and gratification

  i mean it he declared -mean
that i am going to save if possible the
rhodes loan though doubtless it may
require additional resources if they
are needed they will be forthcoming
the financial side does not in the least
disturb us therefore and we have come
to you because the king understands
that we must have support and possibly
refuge that is all he asks of you i
shall attempt to clear provarsk out
without bloodshed after that i shall
endeavor to advise the king how to
rehabilitate himself as the real ruler of
marken

  but what do you propose to do
demanded the baron what is the
first move it looks rather difficult to
me provarsk has brains he is fear-
less-fearless in the adventurer way
if you think you have an infant to
fight you are wrong you might
lose

   i never play to lose retorted kent
i make no such calculation

  karl said the baron after a
thoughtful study of the american
all the support i have to give is
yours

  that being so hastily suggested
kent the next move is to send captain
paulo back to bring the princess her
maid and my man ivan here as quickly
as possible it must not become known
to the public that the king has ever
been driven from the kingdom for
the present if his absence is noted it
must be given out that he and his
sister have been here as your guests
voluntarily

  the baron assented with an enthusi-
asm that had in it a suggestion of
mischievousness

  that will do nicely said he and
it will be easy as far as my part is
concerned because i have the finest
body of liars around me that the world
has ever known since ananias gained
repute send for eloise

a fter paulo had been summoned
and sent on his journey they fell
to discussing the plan which the amer-
ican slowly outlined and were still en-
larging upon it when the young officer
returned with his passengers kent
as though curious to interpret the
princess attitude was a silent specta-
tor in the background when she
arrived and smiled his approbation
when he saw her hasten to the king
and study his face unabashed by the
presence of the others and meet his
eyes with an encouraging stare

  i am glad shjeclared very
glad you are going to fight it out
and drive provarsk that un-oeakable
traitor from marken

  with mr kents help i shall try
he said disappointed and perplexed
she slowly dropped her hands and her
eyes sought the american for whom
she had already pronounced aversion
and distrust

  you are accepting his support
rather than-

  kent alert and diplomatic steppe 
forward to prevent the completion of
her sentence

  your royal highness will nermit
me he said suavely to say that i am
trying as best i can to support your

brother  may be of service or not
but what i have to offer i give and
at least we are here together ready for

an effort

  and what is more eloise sharply
exclaimed baron vou hertz this is
no time for any woman folly of tongue
youd better be thankful that karl has
got some one back of him who if im
not badly mistaken is going to do
things hoity-toity dont start in to
make faces at me im old enough to
know a man when i see one you had
better go upstairs to bed

so had all of us come
on no foolishness ill
show you the way

this man-what is his
name-kent has plenty
to do in the morning
and i will not let him be
bothered by anybody

you just stop any desire
to interfere and leave
him alone ill have my
way here this is my
place

 rebelliously she
obeyed and kent
watched her as she followed the
crabbed old man up the grand stair-
case while the latters voice came back
through the deserted halls querulous
and admonitory until it died away a
half-hour later he too stood alone in a
vast room surveying the bed in which
he was to sleep and as he pulled off
his shoes and threw them outside the
door for much needed attention he
grinned as if secretly pleased with his
adventure his lights were out within
fifteen minutes but the watchman won-
dering noted that farther along in the
room assigned to his majesty karl ii
the lights did not go out and a harassed
guest continued to pace with monoto-
nous insistence backward and forward
in front of the windows on which his
shadow was thrown

chapter v

in the city of marken the capital of
marken early rising might have
been a crime here was no sordid
place so highly fascinated by industry

that lights began to glow in workmens
homes before the sun arose not thus
in marken

  the only people who ever opened
windows in marken at dawn were
those who usually with nightcaps on
their heads poked the said nightcappcf
heads out to look at the weather then
with all observations necessary for
prognostication shut the windows
again and retired to think it over for
an hour or two for the markenites
were a people of stolid temper

  true if the day hap-
pened to be fair and
somnolent the sun shin-
ing in their eyes through
some quaint old lattice
or climbing almost bois-
terously like a second-
story burglar into the
depths of some high-
hung balcony caused
them to arise grumbling
people in marken
always did the same
things - came deliber-
ately to the front doors
and opened them
walked out into the narrow cobbled
streets took another look at the weather
yawned thrust their fingers through
their hair grunted good morning to
their neighbors and then sought the
kitchen-sink to wash their faces then
by about nine oclock there might be
a haze over marken-a most savory
haze of ethereal palpitating blue the
blue of a fair dream perfumed but the
perfumed haze in marken was due to
the unanimdus habit of frying sausages

  the dogs of which population there
was nearly as great a number as of-
other people aroused themselves from
the doorways stretched exchanged
neighborly canine salutations by the
customary methods of identification
and then with noses properly dilated
headed for those places where accord-
ing to their fixed belief the sausages
grew and might be obtained

  later the children swarms of them
appeared in the narrow cobbled streets
accompanied by the dogs all of them
adorned by sausage-grease on their
chops and an air of contentment then
still leisurely the shop-shutters began

to come down with creaks and bumps
and portly shopkeepers in their shirt-
sleeves stood in the shade of their door-
ways leaning more or less heavily on
the door-jambs and smoked and read
their papers

rthe storm of the night had eom-
 pletely disappeared with the dawn
and a spring sun busied itself in drying
the mud on this particular market day
when some of the more observant
arrivals noted with curiosity that for
the first time since karl ii had become
a king-with vast and delightful cere-
mony-the gates of his palace were
closed and two grim and fo reign-
appearing sentries stood guard beside
the main entrance each squarely
planted in his sentry-box as if he had
grown there overnight like a fungus
and so he had in truth

   the palace stood on the flat top of
a fair hill and was surrounded by a
wall every good palace has to have
one and all others do not count
doubtless in some ancient day there
had been a moat but this had been
filled and turfed and where in the time
of his august predecessors had been a
considerable place daruts for the drill-
ing of fighting men karl ii had created
a garden of distinguished beauty in
which it was scornfully whispered by
the malcontents he himself occasion-
ally worked with pruning-shears and
spade he had approached sacrilege
by modernizing the palace itself some-
thing criminally undignified inasmuch
as no good palace should have either
drains or sanitary contrivances it
makes them too much like other folks
houses and somehow people expect
kings to be different from everybody
else furthermore as a final proof
that he was not fit to be a real king he
tried to pay his debts

it rom the palace windows the quaint
old city of marken red- or moss-
rcofed flowering from window-ledges
its streets dotted here and there with
colorfully clad inhabitants could be
scanned as it stretched away on three
sides from the smaller throne-room
by stepping to a balcony on this morn-
ing- a great deal might have been seen

but nobody in the throne-room took the
trouble there was much other busi-
ness to be done because when a first-
class usurper usurps there are usually
several things that require attention
at least that was the opinion of one
baron provarsk who on this gay morn-
ing was as kent might have said on
the job

  the usurper sat in a big chair at the
head of a table the like of which could
be seen any day in any directors room
of any bank in america neatly pro-
portioned middle-sized carelessly but
well clothed and about thirty-five
years of age he appeared competent
his was rather a handsome fearless
albeit reckless face fairly strong and
without trace of any excess he was
more the rapier type of soldier of
fortune than usurpers usually are and
as far as looks were concerned kent
afterward said he had it on the
king

  on the side of the room opposite
from the balconied or garden side
were ornate inner windows looking out
upon a corridor and-proving that the
baron proposed to take no chances-
there could be seen standing in this
generous passageway a file of armed
men as for them the foreign legion of
africa could not have been more mixed
or mongrel apparently the baron had
been interested in such of the kings
papers and letter as he had been able
to find by ransacking the palace he
scanned them hastily grinning pleas-
antly now and then a good usurper
displays no more delicacy in nosing into
anothers palace than does a cuckoo
intent on laying an egg in anothers
nest

provarsk shoved the papers into
a heap and picked up several other
sheets  his own handwriting just as
a scar-faced man with a scraggly mus-
tache and stubby goatee swaggered into
the room and stood opposite his new
master

  i dont see anything to prevent my
proclamation being sent to the printing
oflice just as it is said provarsk look-
ing up at his lieutenant who had
become such by recruiting from various
foreign sources and drilling provarsks


the blue book magazine

army here ubaldo read it read
it aloud-so i can hear how it sounds

  the new coinmander-in-chief of the
army took the paper and after mum-
bling over a flowery preamble which
viewed with horror and alarm read
aloud the following

   it having come to my knowledge
fortunately that the erstwhile sover-
eign of the free and independent
monarchy of marken king karl ii
had practically completed secret plans
to borrow in the name of the state a
second and larger loan than that with
which his suffering subjects were
already grievously burdened i his
cousin by direct descent from the royal
dynasty ferdinand matilda george
wilhelm ludwig humberto provarsk
baron of the realm did expostulate
with him in the name of the people of
marken and was rehuffed and threats
made against my person

   i therefore gathered for my own
protection a few followers but was
astonished grieved and humiliated to
learn that presumably some time within
the past few days king karl ii had
taken all the available funds in the
treasury and all the royal jewels and
with his sister the royal princess
eloise his chancellor the baron von
glutz who apparently is a fellow-
participant and partner in his defalca-
tion and the renegade captain paulo
fled to parts unknown the abdication
to my sincere and lasting grief is made
certain by the fact that the former king
and his party are known to have aban-
doned the sacred soil of our beloved
fatherland without legal notice and
have been seen on their way to paris

   it has therefore become incumbent
upon me as one of the hereditary royal
family and as a true patriot ready to
sacrifice himself for the kingdom to
assume at least temporarily the reins
of government and to bring chaos from
the muddle into which the foolish
extravagances and corruptions of the
late king and his chancellor have
plunged it 

  this much ubaldo obediently read
aloud after which for a time he read
to himself while the baron yawned
and drummed the table with his
fingers

    it s all right said ubaldo tossing
it back on the table but  always like
to see them end up properly most of

those ive helped get up before have

something about how the people are to
be freed from taxation work and all
that stuff then all of em have one of
two things at the tag end-they either
beseech the dear faithful subjects and
patriots to rest quietly and peacefully
until the new ruler always aided by
god almighty gets downto the con-
crete foundations and straightens every-
thing out or else they warn the damned
public to avoid congregating in groups
on any public street showing any lights
at night making any undue disturb-
ances or speaking above a whisper on
penalty of being shot dead instantly
all their goods and likely womenfolk
escheating to the crown

  um-m-mh thats so thought-
fully observed the baron

  and i should advise the dear-
people-keep-quiet stuff and all that
hastily observed ubaldo otherwise
we might have a scrap and there might
not be enough of us also eighteen or
twenty of the army signed on as
soldiers with the understanding that
they wouldnt have to do any fighting
and there arent more than three that
could hit a bam with a shotgun at ten
paces distance

  baron provarsk grinned amiably and
hurriedly wrote another page or two
pausing but once to look up when part
of the new army flattened its -nose
against the panes of the corridor
window

  pull those curtains across that
window so nobody can see in he
growled irritably also see that hand-
kerchiefs are made part of the regula-
tion uniform some of your men er-
rather disturb my cultured side

tthe new commander-in-chief duti-
 fully obeyed then he disappeared
into the hall and swore painstakingly
but fluently in seven different tongues
while provarsk completed his mani-
festo

  there he said as if highly satis-
fied when his lieutenant returned
ive added in the gentle appeal for
peace and order also ive offered ten

x
the unknown mr kent



thousand pounds for old von glutz
dead or alive five thousand for that
fellow paulo and stated that we are
making indefatigable efforts to recover
the loot from the royal absconders and
have hopes of getting it

  the new commander-in-chief was
making mental calculations

  about that fifteen thousand
pounds- he said abstractedly staring
at the ceiling i didnt know you had
found that much on tap let me see
fifty men and me getting ten shares
makes sixty and sixty goes into
fifteen-

  you neednt badger your empty
skull about that angrily remarked the
usurper there isnt any fifteen thou-
sand that i know of

  but supposing somebody does catch
the chancellor or paulo

  then well have the chancellor
and paulo killed in their cells after
which well accuse the fellows that
claim the reward of murder and have
them hanged publicly as proof of how
lawful and orderly we are cheerfully
replied the baron besides either old
von glutz or paulo will be hard to
catch theyll not show up until long
after ive got so firmly fixed in the
saddle that no one will dare try to upset
me i think t shall have this posted on
every church and- well what is it
he demanded as a sentry appeared at
the door

  a man to see you sir who insists
on an immediate and private audience
says you will be glad to see him at once
here is his card sir

  he advanced and tendered a card
which provarsk scowling with annoy-
ance took and scanned his face
changed from a look of anger to one
of amusement

  he is right he said ive an idea
that this chap and i might do some
profitable business together no one i
want to see so much just now you
can bring mr richard kent agent for
john rhodes esquire up at once

  the sentry saluted and disappeared
and provarsk turned to his lieutenant

  i want to be left alone and undis-
turbed when this man comes up he
said pointedly when he gets in the
room you go outside shut the door

after you stand guard to see that no
one gets his ear tangled up with a crack
in the door and-by the way keep
your own away too this is going to
be private business strictly private
understand 

ttbaldo grinned mirthlessly and
said orders should be obeyed
evidently at a pinch he stood in con-
siderable awe of his new master for
he was threatening to wax voluble con-
cerning his own sense of discipline
when the visitor arrived his advent
was preceded by the persistent thump-
ing of a stick on the tiled floor by
sundry titters and muttered gibes from
the guardsmen in the corridor and then
by his own voice admonishing some-
what testily some unseen person to
exercise more care and not let him fall

  provarsk saw an apparently infirm
decrepit and palsied man being half led
half carried into the room by a veri-
table giant of an attendant as if the
visitor were paralyzed from the hips
downward and could but drag his legs
with difficulty

  you discern my infirmities sir
said the financial agent hence i crave
your permission to be seated in asking
such a favor i--ivan what are you
trying to do you lumphead  trying
to let me fall and murder me eh big
slow clumsy lout ill get another
valet i will so help me bob i
will

  his voice had risen by degrees to a
querulous irascible scream that ended
with there there there easy
now  that does it now stand by me
with the ammonia and dont go to
sleep if i get faint

  he settled helplessly into the chair
toward which the baron had waved a
hand panted laboriously as if the exer-
tion had been trying and seemed
startled when the doors leading to the
corridor closed with a harsh clicking
sound

  you are mr kent- suavely began
provarsk

  financial agent for john rhodes
who loaned this kingdom five million
dollars on my advice the visitor
finished the sentence eying the usurper
at the opposite end of the table


the blue book magazine

  provarsk smiled sadly and shook his
head quite with a regretful air but
politely waited for his visitor to pro-
ceed

  dangerous man this knows how
to keep his mouth shut was kents
mental measurement aloud he said
i came here in my employers interests
and was told at the very gates of the
palace that the king had abdicated and
that a distinguished baron provarsk
now ruled in his stead or at least was
at present the head of the govern-
ment

he paused and watched the baron
who bit his lower lip tried to keep
from frowning and mentally swore
that he must find out which sentry had
been so frank in statement and see
that his case was amply attended to

  i presume therefore continued
the visitor that it is the baron pro-
varsk i must interview concerning the
state indebtedness

  that is true replied the usurper
and i am baron provarsk now that
you are made comfortable perhaps it
is as well considering the confidential
nature of our interview that you dis-
miss your man for a few minutes mr
-ah- he consulted the card to re-
fresh his memory -mr kent
quite impossible quite impos-
sible quite impossible declared
the agent resuming some of his former
air of irritability cant you see for
yourself that he is both hands and feet
to me ill answer for him he al-
ways goes where i go dont mind
him talk as if he isnt here he for-
gets i pay him for that-and for
being dumb besides if he ever said
that you said or that i said or that
anybody ever said anything at any
time or any place id say he was a liar
ah men of affairs deny all interviews
and call all reporters liars when it suits
their convenience so theyre all liars
-everybodys a liar but you and me
provarsk decided that there was
quite a lot of wisdom in that speech
it indicated possibilities moreover as
it fitted in so closely with his own
cynical code it was up to this money-
li-nder to take the responsibility if any-
thing embarrassing was said

  as you wish he said with a little
shrug

  what i came for and all that
interests me said the agent is-to
know what provisions the new govern-
ment proposes to make for the payment
of its bonds they are almost due i
dont care a rap who paysthem all
i want is the payment money alone
does not change it has no regard for
the hand that borrows spends or pays
it absorbs no personality no identity
it has neither fealty nor religion it
outlasts kings and cardinals it is
admirable being steadfastly itself
his eyes were wide and vacant as he
rhapsodized but now they came
quickly to another cast and he
demanded what does the new
government of the great sovereign
state of marken intend to do about
the bonds held by mr john rhodes

the usurper stared straight at him
wondering if there was intentional
sarcasm in this money-lenders speech
but meeting with a stare even steadier
than his own and devoid of anything
save inquiry resolved to continue in
diplomacy

  i am exceedingly sorry mr kent
he said with an admirable assumption
of regret to say that the late king my
cousin karl was not-ah what shall
i say to seem kindly yet truthful in
fact karl was anything but a great and
farsighted monarch indeed he was
a plain unadulterated idiot

  it appears so you are here dryly
observed the american and again the
usurper wondered if there might be a
double significance in his words
patiently however he resumed 

  he managed the affairs of the king-
dom of marken very faultily he was a
theorist and a reformer the marken-
ites wish neither theory nor reforma-
tion it is a staid sober and self-satisfied
nation it is not the most powerful
nor the richest nation in the world
but such as it is it is my unfortu-
nate and lamented cousin did not under-
stand it it did not understand him
with the very best of intentions he
failed-failed because he was not
adept as you and i are mr kent in
financial affairs
the unknown mr kent



  he waited for an instant for this sug-
gestion to sink- in then satisfied by the
twinkle of his visitors eyes that it had
been fully understood and being there-
by emboldened he proceeded in that
same gentle courteous well-modulated
tone that was quite nearly if not
wholly ingratiating

  owing to this mistaken direction
of funds and failure to realize from
resources it will thereby be necessary
regrettable as it may seem at first sight
-and at first sight only mr kent-
that mr rhodes loan be extended and
also that the state be provided with
additional funds that it may redeem
not only its original bonds but all others
that follow

ient had been thoughtfully staring
upward but now he dropped his
eyes to those of his vis-a-vis

  quite so he said encouragingly

  it would be-let us say-profitable
for allconcemed the barons voice
had lowered itself and conveyed much
it is the business of your superior to
lend from his enormous stores of
wealth a man with so rftuch money
has but one object to lend it you
as his agent have but one employment
to see that it is lent is that not so mr
kent

  the baron was now leaning eagerly
across the big table with a meaning
smile like an angler who sees a coveted
trout nosing his bait

  quite so came again the encourag-
ing assent

  and you as a most capable ageqt
for the most distinguished financier in
the world perhaps receive for doing
the lions share the brainy share let us
say a commission

  you are right about that declared
the american grinning steadily into the
barons face and inviting him to come
still further

  then said the baron dropping all
pretense and confident of his ground
what use is there for you and me to
ride this merry-go-round any longer
you want money so do i rhodes
has it-plenty of it what commission
do you usually make on a loan of five
million dollars

  kent eyed him in perfect under-

standing and pretended a certain
amount of caution by throwing a quick
glance over his shoulder at ivan who
with a face as blank as the wall stared
straight in front of him and even
yawned deliberately as if infinitely
bored by hearing a lot of stuff that he
had heard before

  suppose i said one per cent ques-
tioned the american with an air of
slyness

  then i should say instantly
reciprocated the baron now fully con-
vinced that if you induced john
rhodes to advance another million dol-
lars you should be entitled-he
stopped short got to his feet resting
his palms on the long table leaned
far across aod spoke scarcely above a
whisper-to a bigger commission than
you ever had in your life enough so
that you could relinquish your diffi-
cult and burdensome duties mr kent
and retire if you can induce rhodes
to extend the time of the previous
bonds five years and to advance a mil-
lion dollars more for ten years on the
same terms as those preceding ill
make you an independent man by
giving you one million francs think
of it a million francs for your own 
is that worth while

  kent sat stolidly in his chair and to
all outward appearances considered the
proposition

  but what of rhodes he asked
lifting his eyes slowly what of
rhodes does he ever get his money
how will you raise it

  sweat it out of the hands ad hides
of these citizens of marken was the
emphatic reply still carried across the
desk in that suggestive and meaningful
undertone

 and yours  how much do you
get

  ill get enough that is not your
affair somewhat stiffly responded the
usurper all that need concern you
is that i hope and think rhodes will
lose nothing and that you will make
a million francs also that no one but
you and i are ever to know anything
about it it is after all a clean deal
you get well paid for your work i get
well paid for my management rhodes
gets well paid for his advance


the blue book magazine

a gain the american made that
 queer twisting movement and
glanced over his shoulder to reassure
himself that ivan was still standing be-
hind him the baron complacently
dropped back into his seat beaming
with satisfaction he accepted the con-
clusion too speedily as was evinced by
his visitors next remark kent leaned
slowly back rested his hands on his
hips  and laughed the usurper
frowned at him

  hot stuff fresh from the bat
kent said in his native tongue then
he reverted to the language of marken
say i admire your line of talk i do
you are quite all right i rather
expected something like this why i
really believe you are trying to bribe
me personally arent you

  of course i am the usurper
smiled placidly you had no idea i
was sending you out into this cold and
cruel world to start an orphans home
or a hospital for indigent and decrepit
chorus-girls did you i put no con-
ditions on what you are to do with the
money its for you

  have you ever sold any grecn-
goods demanded kent if not
youve certainly missed your calling
the baron failed to understand this
literal translation of an unknown
swindle but he surmised that his
proffer was being ridiculed and having
made his last pitch in this direction his
face hardened and he displayed the real
man he was resourceful striving for
a new hold he became quite natural
ready to storm his way through strike
smash under-foot and pass on

  you jest he said unsmilingly
you think you can play with me
good if you dont induce rhodes to
advance another five million francs i
promise you this that he shall never
get a single centime of the money he
has already advanced and that i shall
also tell him that you made me take
this decision how floes that strike you
mr richard kent

  he sat back with an air of triumph
and waited

  strike how does that strike me
why very good baron save for this
that i took a few precautions before i
came here in fact you rather please

me when  recall that you are some-
what younger than i and doubtless
lacking in experience i think you
might do well on wall street or in a
good stiff game of poker ever play
it i hats too bad youre ignorant
of a lot that we teach schoolboys over
in america by the way have you a
telegraph-form 

  puzzled by this swift speech and
inclined to believe that the difference
in national characteristics accounted
for any failure of agreement after all
the baron resumed his air of suavity
and threw a blank sheet of paper across
the table ivan as if schooled to serv-
ice laid the blank in front of his
employer and handed him a pencil

  you said remarked kent with the
pencil poised in his fingers and looking
across at the baron that if i didnt
get rhodes to advance you five million
francs more you would repudiate the
loan 

  i said it

  you dont dare do it

  i dont eh try me mr kent

there was the utmost assurance in
his words but his manner belied
them as he watched the american who
painstakingly scrawled a message on
the sheet of paper and then almost
carelessly tossed it along toward pro-
varsk it fell short and ivan like an
automaton picked it up and handed it
on to its destination with a show of
nothing more than cursory interest the
baron read it it was addressed to the
foreign minister of austria and read

    provarsk who is now dictator of
  marken owing to the abdication of karl
  it repudiates rhodes loan the action
  previously anreed upon between us is
  now expected and will be responded to
  iis promised immediate results will be
  easy of accomplishment

                     richard kent
             agent for john rhodes

  the baron read it with an unmoved
face

  of course he said as placidly as
if discussing the weather i don t
understand its meaning

  thats easy to explain declared the
american and there was something in
his attitude quite like that of a cat play-
the unknown mr kent



ing with a beetle or a gentleman hold-
ing a royal flush while the others con-
sider austria lias borrowed money
quite a lot of it-and wants more i
might add-from mr rhodes funny
condition attached to that loan baron
might interest you to know about it
laughable and unusual in fact

  he bent forward and smiled sweetly
at the usuiper

  something like this that loan was
granted and the second request con-
sidered with the proviso that if marken
refused to pay that five million dollars
austria was immediately to take over
marken and assume the indebted-
ness

  provarsk read the message agaiu
and pondered while gazing at the sheet
then he laid it on the table impolitely
yawned while holding his finely shaped
hand over his mouth excused himself
and drawled that was rather neat
of you all right ill have it sent
and he arose to reach for the bell on
the far side of the table

 just a moment the american
interrupted why are you so willing
to destroy marken your native coun-
try

  provarsk laughed heartily

  destroy nothing he retorted con-
temptuously i am merely amused at
the bewilderment which will be sus-
tained by the austrian minister on
receipt of this message

lent continued to watch him un-
moved the baron indicating
that he would no longer dally with a
situation over which he had control
sharply rapped his knuckles on the out-
spread message and said insolently
this is what your countrymen call a
bluff you know it ill let you know
a little more it doesnt in the least
influence me you can send it if you
wish i dont care furthermore this
twaddle about destroying the country
makes me laugh rubbish sheer
rubbish when addressed to a man who
has seized a throne and who thereby
stakes not only his fortunes but his life
on the result and his ability to main-
tain himself i dont care much more
about this country than you do and
you may as well know that too

  give me the message kent said
the usurper thrust it across toward
him facilitated its passage by blowing
it sharply with his pursed lips and then
calmly sat down kent took it twisted
it into a knot and with thumb and
finger flipped it into the air for a
moment they looked at each other
provarsk alert and with increasing in-
solence the american humorously and
secretly pleased

  why do you know he said sud-
denly almost as if speaking to him-
self and expecting no reply you are a
lot more interesting and much smarter
than i gave you credit for being some-
how or other though i dont believe
you are going to put it through you
dont dare to ruin a kingdom youve
called my bluff and now i call
yours

  the baron sneered

  dont dare to carry it out to the
end you mean try me

  perhaps i shall that depends
yes i rather think i will

  that old saw about possession being
nine-tenths you know mr kent
the baron now spoke with painful
gentility

  that being the case i suppose i
may as well go replied the ameri-
can

  oh i shouldnt be in too big a
hurry the usurper said with a mean-
ing grin that did not extend above his
lips im afraid richard kent
agent for john rhodes that you shall
not make your departure from this
palace until you have induced your
employer to advance the additional
loan needless to add that under these
new conditions you can scarcely expect
any commission whatever

  the american did not appear dis-
turbed  yet there was a peculiar watch-
fulness in his manner

  humph you dont dare to detain
me he said

  dont dare to detain you thats a
joke dont dare i not only dare to
detain you but in case this money-
lending penny-scraping master of
yours doesnt advance  dare to have
both you and that stupid dummy behind
you shot and put nicely out of the

  jf he had expected to frighten his
visitor he must have been disappoint-
ed for with the utmost contempt the
latter grinned directly across at him
and then chuckled deep in his throat

  youre not half the man i thought
you he said jeeringly im quite
disappointed in you to tell the truth
dare  why you wouldnt dare do
anything its a pity you had me
respecting you as a pretty fair game-
ster but this last lot about detaining
me brigand and ransom stuff cheap
melodrama really hurts me call in
one of those louts outside and by an
exchange take your proper place you
and your mob are after all a lot of
penny whistles squeaking thinly in a
country lane

tfiere was everything of studied in-

	suit in his tone his look the
play of his hands as he spoke and the
baron surprised upset angered and
tired by his long hours of excitement
responded as the american wished-
lost his temper jumped to his feet in
a fury unnoted by him the american
had given an odd signal across his
shoulders by curiously twisting his fin-
gers and waving them and expectant
and watchful ivan had observed and
slowly cautiously edged around the
table side to his employers elbow
now he came inch by inch a little
farther to a position where he could
fix his eyes on kents lips the baron
resolved to exert his authority came
around the comer and reached for the
bell kents lips moved noiselessly
although he sat still

  now ivan get him quickly
he said and the giant whirled and
leaped even as the barons fingers were
within an inch of the bell that would
summon assistance one of ivans
huge hands was clasped over the
usurpers mouth the fingers seeming
bent on crushing the lower part of the
barons face while the huge servitor
threw his other arm completely around
the baron pinioned him and lifted
him from the floor as if he were but a
combative boy in weight and strength
roughly ivan bent provarsk back
across the table-then slammed him
down on the top of it with such force

that the barons breath was almost
churned from his body then swiftly
releasing his ami ttm around the
barons body he lifted himself on one
tiptoe and planted a heavy knee in the
pit of provarsks stomach while
the other hand shot to the usurpers
throat and threatened by main strength
to crush the bones of his victims neck
the barons eyes protruded and he be-
gan to struggle feebly

  kent rushed to ivans side and
attracted his attention by tapping him
smartly on the shoulders with his
knuckles ivan without relaxing his
hold looked at his employers lips

   dont kill him for heavens sake
dont kill him kent muttered

   ive got to choke his teeth loose he
has set them in the palm of my hand
the giant replied but he was saved
from executing the baron who at that
moment dropped back inert his face
purple and his eyes dazed with
threatened unconsciousness unnoted by
either kent or provarsk an automobile-
horn had been tooting lustily outside
its mellow notes playing a trumpet-tune
that swept vigorously through the open
windows again it sounded and kent
threw his head up and listened

  what can that mean he said
aloud forgetting that ivan could not
hear that is one of the royal auto-
mobiles because no others are allowed
to carry such horns 

  it did not sound again the baron
was beginning to recover his senses and
anger although now the latter was
curiously intermingled with respect if
not fear kent stood over him per-
fectly calm and self-possessed

   listen provarsk he said  and
make no mistake my man and i may
have trouble getting you out of here
but of one feature rest assured if any
of your sentries come in to take us or
to help you they will find a dead leader
on this table

an almost sly smile shifted the grim
outlines of his mouth as he added
speaking entirely for the barons ears
and well aware that ivan watching his
prisoner could not take the order
ivan if the baron opens his mouth to
call for help or makes any attempt to
the unknown mr kent



reach that bell kill him instantly by
breaking his neck across the edge of the
table if you prefer you may cut his
head off with that knife on your hip
but make no noise do it quickly and
surely

  he saw that provarsk was impressed
with his peril but also saw a sudden
gleam of exultation leap into the mans
eyes at a sound which now became
audible throughout the corridor a
sound of commotion and a womans
voice raised to an indignant pitch of
determination

  how dare you attemp to block my
way it demanded who are you
and your scrapheap band of adventur-
ers to attempt to keep me from coming
into my own palace

  but but madame they heard the
voice of ubaldo protesting

  i am not madame i am the royal
highness the princess eloise and i am
going to see and talk to baron pro-
varsk no matter who interferes out
of my way

  thats the bird the baron wanted us
to make sure of last night captain
another voice coarse and heavy called
out better let her go in hell be
glad to see her

  but the princess does not under-
stand that my orders are-

  it was evident that ubaldo was
retreating in front of her up the corri-
dor toward the entrance to the throne-
room and that she was steadily
advancing bravely and impetuously
intent on confronting the usurper

  kents face hardened he thrust
his hand into his pocket brought out
a heavy automatic pistol slipped the
safety-catch off with hands that did not
tremble and planted himself just inside
the door tvan obedient to previous
understanding that no matter what
occurred after they were in the palace
provarsk was to be his especial charge
held the usurper down with the steadi-
ness of a stone man the noise in the
corridor increased makingn plain that
the guard highly entertained had fallen
into the princess wake they heard
her turn on them

  what do you mean by follow-
ing after and annoying me she
questioned angrily

jtbaldo anxious to find some
means of extricating himself from
a ridiculous position bawled the
princess is right halt you men fall
in stand at attention

  there was a quick shuffling of feet as
the guardsmen obeyed

  now your royal highness if you
still insist i will announce you

  no you wont she said all you
can do is to stand to one side ill
announce myself

  that she gained her way was evident
by her entrance as she swung one of
the doors open and with white cheeks
and blazing eyes stepped inside
instantly the american closed the door
behind her at the sound of the clos-
ing door she turned apprehensively like
one entrapped but both fear and anger
gave way to astonishment as she
grasped the signs of struggle that were
before her the american with pistol in
hand and on the table the discomfited
usurper intently watched by the giant
who did not so much as glance up at
her entrance

  what-what is the meaning of
this she faltered all her own resolu-
tions upset by the strangeness of the
tableau

  provarsk dumbly rolled his eyes
toward her kent replied

  it means that the princess has
arrived at a most inopportune mo-
ment he said coldly i left positive
instructions that neither you nor any-
one else was to interfere with my
plans

  and my brother took orders from
you she said sarcasm in her inflection
and i told him that if there w-as no
man of our house who dared to face
this upstart baron i would do it my-
self and alone

  a reluctant approval of her bravery
shone in kents grim resolute face

  how could my brother know she
demanded as her temper again came
uppermost that the agent of john
rhodes who seeks his pound of flesh
and nothing more would not come here
and ally himself with this adventurer
i am not without honor kent
answered quietly and with a fine
dignity of his own the situation as
you find it is sufficient proof


the blue book magazine

  she hesitated bit her lip and looked
back at the other participants in this
outre scene into which she had reck-
lessly forced her way the proof of
kents fidelity to her house was palpa-
ble in that restrained and desperate
figure stretched out and held relent-
lessly by the silent giant and by the
americans readiness to defend her
against the squalid band outside

  you have impugned my motives
before his cold restrained voice again
broke in and with a quality that she
could not misinterpret but you have
now interfered seriously in an emer-
gency whose difficulties are increased
by your presence you have jeopard-
ized our chances so you shall and must
obey what i atn going to tell you

  must must

  must and shall

  for an instant they eyed each other
then frightened by his very domination
and strength she felt suddenly dis-
turbed

  come he said we have no time
to quibble if you value your life or
your brothers possession of the throne
you will do precisely as i tell you if
this cannot be accomplished with your
friendship as an aid it shall neverthe-
less be accomplished i expect you
to obey implicitly it is our only
chance

  overawed by his determined pose
she bowed her head in enforced assent
he stepped across to the side of the
table touched ivan on the arm and
gestured for him to release their
prisoner

  get up provarsk the american
curtly ordered and as the baron stiffly
descended from the table and began
with nervous fingers to rearrange his
disordered cravat kent glanced swiftly
at ivan to assure himself that the
latters gaze was fixed on his lips he
spoke slowly distinctly and with force-
ful quietness addressing himself to the
baron but with his head slightly turned
that the giant might read

 drovarsk you and i are going
out of this room and through that
corridor arm in arm while you
apparently assist me in a friendly
fashion ivan will support me on the

opposite side becausc my arms will be
crossed the one on your side being
beneath my coat you will support me
with your left side toward me my
gentle friend fotdefinite reason
he grinned and paused to give his
words effect

  that reason is as you may have
surmised that every foot of the way
the hand beneath my coat will be press-
ing this gun against your heart and
that if you even falter attempt to break-
loose or give the slightest alarm ill
kill you as remorselessly as i would a
snake our peaceful progress is the
only way by which you have the
remotest chance of being alive fifteen
minutes from now if we are compelled
to fight our way out it will be after
your dead carcass is left behind on the
corridor tiles make no mistake con-
cerning my determination and ability to
carry this through this time there is
no bluff

  terrified by the possibilities of
tragedy before her eyes the princess
asked in an awed whisper what do
you intend to do with him

  if he lives through the next few
minutes i shall take him to the auto-
mobile waiting there in the streets and
kidnap him after the king has
returned to his throne we shall see
probably i shall permit him to live
that depends entirely on his behavior
i expect you to play your part well

  he turned to the baron with a scowl
on his face

  now he said this as sure as
youre alive is a moment of fate for
you also lest any of your fool guard
might suspect you must pretend to
engage me in friendly conversation
the friendlier the better my lad for i
shall listen earnestly to that pleasant
discourse that i expect to fall from
your lips i have observed that you
can talk rather well on occasion open
the doors princess eloise and pass out
you know the way

  right royally she obeyed nerving
herself to a direct and unfaltering
progress her pale clean-cut face the
haughty carriage of her finely poised
head and her deliberate graceful stride
proclaiming her the royal princess in
truth

  provarsk felt the strength of the
rigid arm that clasped his own against
the americans side and the rigid pres-
sure beneath it of the firmly held steel
tube any doubts he had relative to
the helplessness of his position were
confirmed any hope he cherished of
escape was subdued by the fear and
certainty of death imminent ready and
inexorable for now to increase his
discomfiture the hobbling dragging
man a picture of physical incapacity
had bent a trifle forward and turned his
gaze upward that he might watch even
the expression of his prisoners face
the surreptitious wink of an eye would
provarsk felt be as fatal as a shrill
scream

  ah my dear baron you were
saying-  he writhed mentally at the
sound of the high querulous assumed
voice and hastened to reply when he
felt the pressure of the pistols muzzle
harshly increased against his ribs

   i was saying he replied with cool
untrembling bravado that we can
finally rearrange our affairs at a later
date at present of course you have
the best of it

  decidedly decidedly croaked
the visitor and there is nothing i
love better than a man who tries to
balance his obligations but i trust
my dear baron provarsk that the cares
of state which now burden you wilf
scon be over with

the usurpers face flushed red but
he controlled himself to pass the
crisis but whatever else provarsk
was he was a good sportsman and
somehow the humor of the situation
even in this time of stress appealed
he broke into a cynical laugh that
echoed through the corridors and con-
vinced the wondering ubaldo that there
was nothing overt in the situation the
latter even grinned and winked at his
comrades after the procession disap-
peared and declared  trust him  hes
a fox already he has that doddering
old ass just where he wants him now
you fellows can take a rest

  the two sentries on guard in the
gayly painted sentry-boxes outside the
palace gates decided when they saw the
princess who had almost forced her

way into the palace reappear and enter
her car that they had done well to
admit her for surely that great leader

baron provarsk whom they had
assisted to the throne talked most gayly
when he drove away in the second car
with the high-voiced cackling old man
who still clung to him in a most
friendly manner the only difficulty
about a revolution after all the sentries
decided was that it robbed the invaders
or enough sleep and thereupon they
yawned widely and tried once more to
interest themselves in the appearance of
the villagers and farmers who passed
leisurely with baskets and fowls totally
unaware that they were in the midst of
a revolt

chapter vi

two autgmobiles-the first a
closed car carrying a royal prin-
cess who was still in a state of
mental turmoil and distress largely
punctuated at times by the knowledge
that she had met one man who paid no
deference to her title and the second a
long stream-line touring-car bearing on
its panels the arms of baron von hertz
and carrying three passengers and a
chauffeur in the barons uniform-i
stormed up the steep ascent to the
castle hertz and came to a halt

  two men emerged anxiously from
the great doors and smiled with satis-
faction when they identified the occu-
pants of the second car

  got him exclaimed kent leaping
easily from the car and by the way
baron von hertz if those gates or the
drawbridge still work it mght be as
well to close them until we finish our
business with our guest hes able and
slippery

  the old baron chuckling ambled
away to obey the request ivan
alighted the princess eloise had al-
ready reached earth and told her
chauffeur to take his car to the garage
and provarsk resigned for the moment
to his capture slowly descended he
smiled cheerfully at the king bowed
with mock politeness and quite airily
waved his hand

  good morning cousin he said i
hope i see you well


the blue book magazine

  the king stared at him with
smoldering eyes the princess tossed
her head turned her back and walked

into the castle

  she doesnt seem fond of me
cousin whimsically exclaimed the
usurper

  the king disdained reply

   its a very cold formal inhospitable
place to which you have brought me
mr kent observed provarsk turning
toward the american with an air of
gentle reproof i had anticipated a
welcome glad shouts from the
peasantry ringing of joy-bells in the
castle

  why questioned kent dryly
perhaps none of us regarded you as
worth it he suddenly dropped all
badinage and turned to baron von
itertz who had returned from his mis-
sion i suppose you have some place
where you can keep our guest
securely

  several very fine unhealthy dun-
geons here was the cheerful reply

the american thoughtfully stared at
i the usurper and then said no 
dont think i like that i dont want
him to contract typhus or influenza or
croup hes too nice a boy for that
besides i may want to use him later
on whats up in those towers
that one over there von hertz
indicated with a pointed finger con-
tains rather a fair prison chamber-
strong enough but no one has entered
it so far as i know for about a hundred
years

  good cant it be made com-
fortable for baron provarsk

  quite easily declared von hertz
and in the meantime i can have him
guarded in another chamber bring
him along

  provarsk unhesitatingly followed the
owner of the castle with the american
leisurely pacing by his side and ivan in
the rear

  thats decent of you mr kent the
prisoner said calmly

  why not ive no ill feeling against
you provarsk weve merely played
in the same game and youve lost

  so far the prisoner qualified

  kent laughed approvingly

  now youre talking he declared

  i hat s just thjcind of spirit i like

i had son of lost interest in you awhile
back you seemed too easy but now
i really begin to regard you as worth
while hello here we are nice
room too

  he walked across and looked through
a window observing that it overlooked
a precipitous cliff with a sheer drop
below it of several hundred feet no
other doors save the one through which
they entered gave egress the room
was spacious and quite modemly fur-
nished he walked back and examined
the heavy old-fashioned cumbersome-
keyed lock on the stout oaken door and
spoke to baron von hertz

  why not leave him here with a
proper guard on the outside this makes
a very nice prison for our friend i
prefer that he be treated as a dis-
tinguished guest who has a queer desire
to remain in his own room for the time
being have i your assent sir

  the fine old eyes of baron von
hertz twinkled humorously at the
american for whom plainly he had
formed a distinct liking

  it shall be exactly as you wish mr
kent he assented also you may
trust me to see that your guest does not
lack for prompt attention indeed to
make sure of it i shall keep at least
four men on guard in the corridor from
now on so that on the slightest sound
from within they may hasten to learn
what the baron provarsk desires and
that even his slightest restlessness in
the night may be noted i will also have
a night service as well prompt atten-
tion shall be the rule of the hotel
hertz is there anything he wishes
now prior to our departure

  provarsk grinned nonchalantly and
threw himself into a chair

  some ham and eggs landlord and
see to it that the eggs are fried on both
sides bread and butter-no rancid
stuff mind you or ill complain to the
management coffee lots of it with
ample cream the fact of the matter
is that some small business affairs of
mine have been so urgent that ive not
had time to eat during the last twenty-
four hours i shall be glad for a rest
-just a slight one you understand
the unknown mr kent



because i really must rc ime my indus-
tries at the first opportunity

  quite so quite so von hertz
replied in the same vein you may
trust me to observe even the most
minute details for your comfort
and before we go-sorry kent
stepped quickly across and relieved
provarsk of a small pocket-pistol and
a penknife while the latter said gayly
so am i sorry rather hoped youd
overlook them

provarsk had calmly cocked his
heels up on the edge of the casement
and was whistling softly between his
teeth when they bolted the door on him
ivan was left on guard for the few
minutes necessary for his relief and
when he descended the stairs was at
once directed to the small reception-
room in which baron von hertz had
received his guests on the previous
night the king and the american
were standing in the center of the room
the latter evidently repeating some for-
mer instruction

  and you are quite certain that
captain paulo has had sufficient time
and can be depended on to the minute
the american asked

  positive declared the king with
great earnestness

  and you will attend to the other
arrangements

  yes mr kent

  then here goes and-good luck to
us all

  the american would have turned
from the room without further cere-
mony but the kings face glowed and
impetuously he held out his hand

  just a moment sir he said if
anything goes wrong and-your mis-
sion may be dangerous i want you to
know that i appreciate all you have
done and are trying to do for me
theamerican seemed embarrassed by
this display of gratitude he took the
kings hand but answered brusquely
pshaw you fail to understand that
what i am trying to do is to save
my own credit and to make certain that
john rhodes money is not lost i have
no sentiment-that is-to amount to
anything good-by

  he beckoned to ivan and passed

directly out to the still-waiting touring-
car into which he climbed

  drive us back to the palace in mar-
ken he ordered the chauffeur and as
the car swept forward down the wind-
ing road to the valley below he reflected
that this was the finest sport he had
ever engaged in

rents meditations were brought
to an abrupt stop by a sharp
explosion the car swerved and came
to a halt beside the highway almost
as the chauffeurs feet struck the
macadam kent was by his side the
cause was plain a flattened tire sagging
flaccidly under the weight above
anxiously the american looked at his
watch

  hang it all he exclaimed savagely
weve no time to lose-not even five
minutes any delay at the other end
and- he snapped his fingers con-
clusively he stood above the chauffeur
while the latter unstrapped an old-style
wheel he himself seized the jack but
was thrust aside by ivan whose mighty
muscles sent the lever flying up and
down together they worked with the
adjustment and again ivan worked the
pump with which the car was provided
grumbling in the meantime that they
had to resort to such old-time methods
and thereby lose precious minutes
when he climbed back into the car and
they moved ahead at high speed he
again studied his timepiece and said to
ivan in that voiceless motion of the
lips this difference of twenty minutes
may upset the whole game but weve
got to do our best it cuts us out of a
chance for overcoming awkward pre-
liminaries two oclock was the hour
set for everything

  again they halted in front of the
palace and the sentries saw the crippled
old gentleman assisted from the car
baron provarsk he explained to them
would return shortly and had requested
that he mr kent should be conducted
to the smaller throne-room there to
await unquestioningly the sentries
admitted the caller for was he not the
usurpers friend  and also the news
had spread that through this old simple-
ton money was to come-plenty of it-
enough to make them all rich one of


the blue book magazine

the lounging soldiers of fortune inside
even assisted the visitor up the wide
marble steps and along the corridor
where drowsy men fell back to give

space

  inside die room ubaldo provarsks
captain-at-arms sat beside the table
talking to two other men and his face
which had been perturbed cleared when
he saw the american ushered in he
stared at the door through which kent
and ivan entered as if expecting the
usurper to follow them and betrayed
disappointment that this expectation
was not fulfilled without asking con-
sent ivan led kent to a seat at the head
of the table as if unaware that this post
of honor was reserved for the ruler of
the country then respectfully backed
away until he stood to one side of the
door

  baron provarsk did not return with
you sir ubaldo asked with an effort
at politeness

 i he american quietly consulted his

	watch before answering and a
look of satisfaction crept over his face
leisurely he snapped the case shut
slipped the timepiece back into his
pocket leaned back in his chair and
clasped his hands together carelessly
a dry grin broke over his lips as he
looked at ubaldo and then answered

  no baron provarsk did not return
with me in fact the last i saw of him
he was-er-whistling with satisfaction
while waiting for some ham and eggs
some bread and butter and a cup of
coffee to be served with pure cream

  the three adventurers looked at one
another perplexed it was ubaldo who
spoke

  when may we expect him sir-may
i ask

  why as for that not at all kent
answered with evident candor

  for what reason ubaldo de-
manded while his comrades looked
their intense anxiety

  well mainly for this reason kent
said with the same dry grin as you
being his right-hand man doubtless
know the principal thing he wanted
was money and after that power
provarsk is no fool i can tell you
pietty farsighted i should say he

wanted to see the king-insisted on it
i believea result of it all they
seem to have come to a most satis-
factory understanding-quite satisfac-
tory one might conclude the baron
is thus rendered quite happy by being
enabled with money to go his way
rejoicing the king is probably equally
happy at being enabled to return to his
throne without any fuss whatever and
so there you are

  you mean weve been sold out
 his time ubaldos voice rose to an
angry roar and his two comrades lent
their anger to the occasion

   put it that way if it suits you best
kent remarked carelessly lifting his
hand to conceal a yawn

  ubaldos companions broke for the
door and out into the corridor bawling
betrayed weve been betrayed  sold
out by that- and what they called
provarsk woald not have been pleasant
to the usurpers ears ubaldo turned
hesitantly as if to call them back and
kent seized the opportunity to give a
noiseless command to ivan

  when i get them all inside he
said you slip out quickly and see that
the palace ates are not barred then
speaking aloud he called to ubaldo

  it seems to me that your fellows are
making a pretty good-sized noise over
nothing noise wont help you

in the corridor outside could be heard

	oaths hoarse exclamations and the
sound of running boot-heels over the
tiled floors several of provarsks
adventurers came tearing into the
throne-room shajdng their fists and
wanting to know if what they had heard
was the truth their leader tried in
vain to control them for some minutes
and at last when he obtained attention
did so by outbawling them all

  silence silence there you men
whos leader here you or me i tell
you to hold your tongues until we find
out about this do your hear me

  slowly and sullenly they became sub-
dued ubaldo then turned fiercely on
the american who sat impassive at the
head of the table his manner portray-
ing nothing more than a melancholy
almost disinterested curiosity in his
surroundings
the unknown mr kent



  now you limping old fossil
ubaldo snarled youll tell us exactly
what happened and dont forget this
if you dont tell the truth ill cook you
inch by inch and then throw the cinders
into the streets

  the old fossil looked mildly sur-
prised

  i thought i did tell you he said
if ive got to tell it again suppose you
call all your men in to hear it it
strikes me that youre only one of them
and that any man that joined your
expedition has just as much right to
know what is up as you have

  thats right youre right there
the other adventurers in the room
yelled in chorus some of them in the
meantime scowling at ubaldo and
muttering to-their neighbors that he
was the one after all who had got them
into the mess ubaldo recognized this
sign of danger and tried to quell it but
he was unheeded in the turmoil two
of the guardsmen rushed out of the
room to summon their comrades
ubaldo was vainly trying to bring those
within the room to a cooler state of
mind when the others began to arrive
some of them hurriedly pulling on their
tunics and frowsy-headed attesting
that they had been aroused from sleep
kent imperturbably watching decided
that they were all there inasmuch as
the two men who had rushed out to
give the summons came in last
accompanied by the gate-sentries and
the corridor was still

  all i can say he remarked quietly
is just about what ive said before
baron provarsk is at this moment the
contented guest of the king hes in
a place where you men cant reach him
i fancy he will remain there so long as
he fears he might meet any of you in
fact he doesnt seem eager to renew the
acquaintance of any of you i dont
believe he likes you indeed he has
been unkind enough once or twice to
refer to you as a lot of idiots and what
he said about mr ubaldo i dont care
to repeat why mr ubaldo do you
know he said to me provarsk did that
if all your brains were taken out of
your skull and boiled into tallow they
wouldnt make a candle for a glow-
worm  he said your head would make

a fine snare-drum for goodness sake
man dont be angry with me im
just telling you what the baron tro-
varsk said after he left the palace with
me this morning

  ubaldo grew red with anger and
sputtered and his temper was not
improved by the remarks of some of
his army

lent observed with satisfaction that
ivan had disappeared from his post
by the doorway in an instants lull in
the turmoil about him he heard the
faint clarion warning of an auto-
mobile-horn that played the same gentle
notes indicative of the approach of the
royal automobile and keenly alive to
the necessity of holding this swarm of
adventurers a few minutes longer he
rapped on the table with his bare
knuckles and called in his powerful
voice gentlemen attention please
let me finish

  he waited until they were again
quiet straining his ears the while for a
repetition of the horns warning but
hearing nothing he settled to his task

  now let us be reasonable he said
you are all reasonable men i take it
you joined this expedition somehow
with the hope of bettering yourselves
-making money securing steady
places well you didnt get it you
are done your jig is up you are in
jeopardy youve no more chance than
a lot of dogs in a city pound there
is no one now but the king who can
grant you amnesty you couldnt es-
cape from marken if you tried you
know what they usually do with fellows
like you when they catch them dont
you if you dont ill tell you they
hang them why i wouldnt give a
centime for all of your chances unless
you can square it somehow with the
king theres no use for you to fight
you are probably pretty good and used
to it but fifty men cant do anything
against - say-five thousand husky
peasants armed with everything from
a blunderbuss to a high-powered flat-
trajectory rifle theyd get you sure
the only thing for you chaps to do if
to lay down your hands

  he cocked his head sidewise and
paused in a listening attitude for


the blue book magazine

again he heard the horn-quite dis-
tinctly now his suspense grew and
with it ran his resolution to hold this
mob to the last moment

  dont pay any attention to him
shouted ubaldo dont be fools 

  why thats what provarsk called
you kent said plaintively he said
that if you had had the wisdom of a
garden-worm everything would have
been all right and he said-

  shut up yelled ubaldo menac-
ingly dropping his hand to the hilt of
his sword ill run you through if
you dont vou men keep quiet hear
what ive got to say vou dont know
but what this old paralytic is a liar sent
here by the king to blindfold you

  the crowd glared at the american as
if this suggestion had not hitherto
dawned upon them

  very unkind of you kent mur-
mured and maybe they are already
convinced that you are one

  ubaldo wasted no time in retort

  the only chance weve got he said
loudly is to hold this palace until
baron provarsk returns or until we
am make terms besides weve got
this old imbecile as a hostage and if
hes a friend of the kings theyll let us
go rather than let him be toasted get
back to the gates some of you fellows
others of you go to the walls dont
let anyone but provarsk in ive
warned you about that before and now
you see what kind of a fix you are in
by not obeying my orders get out
and get ready to defend yourselves
he shouted to spur them to action but
before any of them could obey the pre-
tended paralytic had leaped from his
chair and now stood in the door with
his hand upraised his eyes blazing at
them

  stop he commanded

tliev paused astonished at his
physical agility and the aspect of
power presented by his commanding
gesture suddenly while they hesi-
tated through the corridor rang the
loud blare of a trumpet

  gentlemen you are too late
see 

  kent sprang to the hangings that
barred the view of the corridor jerked

them aside and the discomfited adven-
turers hudjjjtd backward to a solid
group when they saw the corridor
nearly filled with trimly uniformed
soldiers of the royal army who stood
quietly with rifles at the ready

 there was another blast of a
trumpet and the american moved
slowly toward the side of the doorway
announcing as he did so here comes
the king

  in a desperate awed silence helpless
and defeated they fixed their eyes on
the door through which followed by
the princess eloise baron von glutz
and captain paulo and accompanied
by a bodyguard the king entered
walked slowly across the room and then
halted and scornfully eyed them man
bv man these who wonld have mur-
dered him for a usurpers hire

  i present to your majesty said a
calm sarcastic voice fifty gentlemen-
at-arms-a fine batch of jailbirds who
at present are idle having just been
mustered out

chapter vii

captain paulo standing in
one of the small reception-rooms
of castle hertz and staring
absently across the lawn on which the
morning sun was shining whistled
softly a very gay tune indicative of a
contented spirit a movement behind
him caused him to turn quickly in-
stantly he came to attention and then
made a punctilious bow

 your royal highness-

  is up early i know what you are
going to say

  the princess spoke with something
akin to petulance and being adroit in
danger-signs captain paulo held his
tongue expectantly the captain of a
royal household-guard has to be some-
thing of a diplomat if he wishes to con-
tinue in his billet the princess walked
across the room and looked absently out
at the lawn for a moment then glanc-
ing over her shoulder to make certain
that they were alone she asked him a
question

  what took place in the palace yes-
terday after i left the room
the unknown mr kent



  mr kent pointed out to provarsks
men the folly of resistance and made
them surrender their arms after
delivering them a homily on the dangers
of rebellion and told them that he
would then appear as their solicitor be-
fore the king

  well well she urged him when
he paused what was done with
them where are they confined
they are not confined anywhere
your royal highness

  she gave a start of astonishment as
if incredulous

  at mr kents suggestion his
majesty granted them full amnesty
with the exception of the man called
ubaldo who has been sent to prison on
an indefinite sentence after that mr
kent selected a few of the most likely
ones that he said he had use for and
suggested that the others be escorted
across the border he also suggested
that each ones picture be taken said
he thought this would serve two pur-
poses one to identify them for hang-
ing if they ever returned and the other
because he thought marken should start
a rogues gallery and this was an excel-
lent opportunity to lay a foundation
suggested he suggested and
everything he suggested my brother
did i simply cannot understand this
situation how on earth it happened
that my brother fell so suddenly and so
completely under the influence of this
money-lender is incomprehensible

ljer annoyance was unmistakable

    captain paulo was secretly thank-
ful that he was not her brother and
was vastly relieved by the entry of that
gentleman in person by the troubled
frown on the kings brows the young
officer decided that every word of the
princess last and captious speech had
been overheard

  you may go captain paulo the
king said significantly and the young
officer saluted and discreetly retired
glad that he was not in the kings
shoes

  eloise the king remonstrated with
an attempt at severity i am sorry to
say that i heard what you said to the
captain does it seem quite fitting that
you should discuss our affairs with-

   why not she retorted coolly its
time they were discussed with some one
on whom i can depend isnt it if i
dont im afraid this man kent will be
running the kingdom as he pleases be-
fore long

  the king winced and lost his air of
admonishment he knew from past
experience that this sister of his dealt
in very plain truths sometimes they
were highly unpleasant anger at his
own impotence caused him to rush to
kents defense moreover he was
filled with great respect for his new
allys rough-and-ready method of doing
things a method that so far had been
invariably successful

  why should you object he asked
has he not proved himself a stronger
and a better adviser than i ever had be-
fore

  but there comes a time when advice
assumes domination  it looks to me as
if his suggestions were assuming the
nature of orders

  well what of it he retorted
goaded by the knowledge that she had
put her finger on the truth you
wouldnt have me decline to do as he
suggests when i can see for myself that
those suggestions are exactly the right
course to follow

  but isnt it time that he were given
to understand-

  my dear sister he exclaimed as
another loophole offering escape from
this unpleasant interview presented it-
self cant you see further than that
how do you suppose this dynasty is to
maintain itself without financial sup-
port cant you fix it plainly in your
mind that john rhodes whose agent
mr kent is could practically ruin
marken if he chose

  oh those bonds again i thought
so well do you know what i would
do if i were king i would calmly
notify this fearsome mr john rhodes
that i wasnt ready to pay his bonds
and that he could wait until i did get
well ready

  is that her royal highness con-
ception of honor in financial under-
takings questioned a dry voice behind
them and they turned to observe kent
standing quietly in the doorway m
i didnt hear anyone announce you


the blue book magazine

she said nettled by his unexpected
interruption

  no he replied affably i dont
suppose you did as an admission i
will say that im so unused to court
affairs and dwelling with royalty and
the presence of superiority that  have
not yet learned all that is expected of
one under such circumstances in many
ways im what we call over home
a rube but now that i am here-i
dont remember that you answered my
question

  his eyes met hers unflinchingly in-
sistently she wondered if there was
not a little of scorn in them-tolerant
but scorn such as one bestows upon
those guilty of moral delinquency she
was driven to defense

  i feel no compulsion to answer the
questions of one who is merely a finan-
cial agent she retorted but since you
have willfully tried to misconstrue my
meaning i will explain that there are
occasions when of necessity one is
forced to adopt measures that under
other conditions would not be at all con-
sidered this is one of them the dig-
nity of royalty must be maintained
the dignity of royalty-must be
maintained even by the repudiation of
its honest debts you are now quite
explicit i did not see your attitude
before

t tnder this sirocco of sarcasm she
withered but still fighting for her
standard replied hotly you deliber-
ately misapply my words

  motives he corrected unmoved

  it was too much she felt like a
schoolgirl being quietly admonished by
a head master

  since you are so exact she re-
marked petulantly perhaps you will
try to make me see that your motives
in assisting us as you have-and we
recognize that service too-are entirely
unprejudiced that you are here as
a philanthropist giving service to our
house one that you have never known
that you are not here because you want
to save money for that person rhodes
for whom you work

  that last may be so he declared
patiently i am here to save john
rhodes money do you believe that

a kingdoar any more than an in-
dividual can advance itself without

money 

  honor is better than money she

asserted

  it seems to me ive heard that be-
fore he said smiling i didnt know
that was in your copy-books also since
you are intent on fighting me suppose
you draw the line for me by telling
where honor begins after one has prac-
tically abrogated ones debts i am
interested mademoiselle i would
know the ideas of royalty in those
matters you see as i have confessed
being an american i have never before
been a sort of member of a kings
household

  a slow patient smile spread over his
ingenuous face as he looked at her
and she more than ever angered at the
strange sense of power that this man
exhaled felt herself again worsted in
the tilt and in proportion hated herself
for her weakness she lifted her head
and with a gesture of indifference
walked toward rhe door he did not
seem at all overawed or impressed
indeed it was more as if he were in-
wardly amused yet desirous of part-
ing friends for future needs he dared
to bar her way and to stand in front
of her with his hands holding the hang-
ings on either side

  come he said you are wrong it
is you who do not understand and
understanding is necessary ive come
here to make good im going to do
it

  a strange jargon this and she
found herself pondering its meaning
and usage

  you neednt trouble to answer he
continued when she hesitated in a be-
wildered study but ill tell you some-
thing before you go it is not yours to
play the part of an obstructionist to
your brothers hopes and ideals if you
love him as a sister should i dont
know it but t presume that it is per-
mitted for the sister of a king to love
her brother and advance his interests
if not kings and princesses should
never be brothers and sisters any-
way its going to be a lot easier
for me to-to get john rhodes
money-she could scarcely account

      - v
the unknown mr kent



for the strange sarcasm in his tone-
and incidentally to help your brother
if we act as friends come will you
not act as our ally in this troublesome
undertaking

che was strangely and unreasonably
moved by his appeal for appeal it
was his mellow voice hastening to his
will and his thoughtful searching eyes
fixing themselves questioningly upon
her face

  unity of action is necessary to suc-
cess he added while she stood before
him waiting for him to stand aside

  for quite a time they confronted each
other he with his hand outstretched
as if inviting her compact and then
slowly his look shifted and lost all its
warmth and veiled itself and his lips
straightened to a harsh obdurate line
he bowed and stepped to one side
beckoning with unconscious grace
toward the open door she knew that
he was wounded by her refusal and
she was no longer aggressive she
fought an impulse to put her hand in
his and become after this relinquish-
ment his faithful partner in the enter-
prise  but that meant she knew that
she must become as her brother
threatened to become his subordinate
without looking back neither disdain-
ful haughty nor yet subdued she
passed through the door and away

  for an instant his face was grave and
hurt and then as if arousing himself
to his task an inexorable master of
himself as well as of others his face
again hardened and he walked toward
the king who throughout the interview
had stood with his back toward the
room as if politely leaving the situa-
tion to adjust itself

  kent put his hands in his pockets
frowned reflectively and said as
brusquely as if addressing an office-
boy please summon von glutz and
captain paulo and ivan at once

  and like an office-boy the king
obeyed he stepped to an electric
button and pressed it after which he
stared at kent who stood lost in
thought von glutz was the first to
enter he bowed deeply to the
king and with marked respect to the
american

  sit down baron make yourself at
home kent said careless of royal
etiquette  and the chancellor disturbed
by this invitation looked at the king
beseechingly

  certainly baron sit down said
the king smiling a little at the strange-
ness of their positions

  captain paulo appeared and at him
kent smiled and nodded and im-
mediately afterward the giant stood in
the doorway with his eyes fixed on
kents lips

  ivan did you serve baron provarsk
in person this morning the financier
asked

  yes sir

  ah how did the baron appear
resigned cheerful or grumpy and
discomfited

  ivan grinned widely

  i am not certain sir but i think
that when i entered he was whistling
resigned perhaps discomfited not
at all certainly he did not seem out
of spirits indeed he was rather gay
he asked me if i had ever seen a blind-
folded dog with a wooden leg playing
football with a one-eyed pig and when
i said no declared that he was rather
astonished because he understood
one could see almost anything in
america

  good hell do all right kent
exclaimed

  his lips opened as if to give a com-
mand and then observing captain
paulo he turned toward the king
respectfully and said if it meets with
your approval sir can we lot have the
insurgent brought here

hr he king appreciating kents con-

	stant care to avoid humiliating him
in the presence of any of his people
gave captain paulo the order and the
latter disappeared with alacrity the
chancellor who plainly ill at ease had
shifted restlessly from one side to the
other seized the opportunity to stand
up looking an apology at the king but
the king evidently good-humored and
curious was watching the american
he could not repress a scowl how-
ever when provarsk was ushered in
with two sentries in front two behind
and captain paulo bringing up the rear


the blue book magazine

the sentries saluted the king and
stepped to one side

  you will stand guard outside with
your men the king directed paulo
kent gestured ivan lo guard the door
from the inside

  good morning cousin and every-
body else americans included blithely
saluted provarsk nice weather isn t
it-ah-after the storm

  kent was the only one who seemed
to enjoy his humor the king turned
his back walked to a chair and seated
himself for nearly a minute in the
silence of the room kent studied pro-
varsks face

  well provarsk he said genially
my bluff seems the best of the lot
doesnt it

  evidently quite freely agreed pro-
varsk only of course i dont as yet
know just how badly i am let in
youll find that out soon enough
one usually does you know was
kents response i believe his majesty
gives you permission to sit

  i do said the king carelessly and
provarsk smiled and seated himself
after an ostentatious and exasperating
grin at the chancellor who promptly
turned purple with rage

  you will pardon me said kent
dryly as he pulled a chair into a posi-
tion where he could directly face pro-
varsk if in our conversation  seem to
be assuming but his majesty has
graciously granted me certain privi-
leges of speech and action which he
will sanction is that not true sire
the king reverting to that strange
curious look of expectancy said it was
and provarsk shielded his mouth with
his finger-tips as if to conceal a smile

provarsk said kent decisively
youre whipped-all down the line
for the moment yes i suppose
the usurper admitted gracefully he
smiled in an amused friendly way

  the king has decided continued
kent placidly that you are a man of
some talent and has therefore con-
cluded to make none other than you
chancellor of his kingdom

p or once provarsk was so completely
surprised that his looks betrayed
him he leaned forward in his chair

and stared at the american doubtfully
baron von glutz cleared his throat
explosively and was nearly speechless
with wlflth

  this is going too far he exclaimed
but was silenced by kent who turned
toward him and said steady steady
baron you neednt worry you will
be cared for later in this--thisrecon-
struction

  but-but- hesitated the king
vastly distressed baron von glutz has
been my mentor since my boyhood and
was chancellor of marken under my
father

  doubtless his administrative excel-
lence accounts for markens present
peaceful conditions-and also for our
unexpected meeting across the border
kent said suavely but as i under-
stood you sire-

  provarsk interrupted with a sneering
laugh and exclaimed  pshaw  i might
have known it it is you who ask me
to be chancellor eh  all right 
accept-under you but not under his
majesty but pray tell me wrhy i am
thus honored

  honored well for several reasons
one that its not so messy as to have
you taken out and hanged another
that you still represent to me a sport-
ing proposition and i like fearless men
who go out after a thing when they
want it its been a long time since i
have met such an interesting sort of a
personage as you seem to be and inas-
much as his majesty wants me to
remain with him for a time as an
adviser id like to see what you can do
-whether you can get the best of us
i promise to do the very best i can
to get the best of you provarsk as-
serted

  i like that too kent said heartily
youre welcome to get away with all
you can-with this understanding that
you must agree to accept and honestly
earn out all orders given you other-
wise-

  otherwise what queried the
baron when the american hesitated

  otherwise well have you promptly
shot also you are honored as you
put it because i believe you are a good
enough gamester once having given
your word to obey orders
the unknown mr kent



provarsk studied kent wonder-
ingly while the latter without a
change of expression stared back at
him

  you dont want to be bothered hang-
ing or shooting me now you think im
too dangerous to exile and you there-
fore prefer to keep me directly under
your eye so you appoint me chancel-
lor rather clever it strikes me

  kent nodded and smiled

  you have it he said

  all right mr richard kent i
accept this chancellorship and agree to
obey all of your orders-or should i
say his majestys-with just one pro-
vision which is that after one years
service i have the privilege of resign-
ing and walking away scot free when-
ever i choose to do so

  quite a nice agreement a very
pleasant agreement indeed kent as-
sented we will now have an inter- 
view with captain paulo

  he gave ivan the order speaking
loudly as though to impress on the new
chancellor that his man was a trifle
hard of hearing and in a moment
captain paulo stood before them

  captain paulo said kent his
majesty the king has graciously dele-
gated me to reorganize the cabinet of
marken and because of your fidelity
you are now appointed minister of the
treasury

  paulo stood with a look of astonish-
ment on his face it was an advance-
ment he had never thought of truly
there must have been some foundation
for the arabian nights for once
the king was not disturbed by the
americans plans and began to wonder
if after all there was not some method
in this new form of madness

  these are my wishes captain
paulo said he

  kent bowed his head gravely to the
new minister of the treasury

  permit me to introduce the new
chancellor of the realm baron pro-
varsk

  paulo found it difficult to bow but
by desperate effort did so provarsk
acknowledged this deference to his
position by an airy thats all right
paulo never can tell what your luck
may be perhaps ill make you a field

marshal yet a piece of pleasantry that
kent appreciated with a slight smile
and which the king plainly resented

  and the baron provarsk is there-
fore now at liberty queried paulo
evidently unable to grasp the extraor-
dinary changes that had taken place

  my goodness man your excel-
lency the minister of the treasury
does not suggest that so exalted and
important official as the chancellor
should be pinched do you  kent asked
with unsmiling lips

  why i should say not exclaimed
provarsk with a great assumption of
dignity i couldnt think of such a
thing ive a mind to ask my cousin
instantly to remove you from office
if i am to act as a cabinet minis-
ter- began paulo

  i would suggest that you and the
chancellor retire to the anteroom and
come to an amical agreement to leave
each other alone kent interrupted
his majesty expects you to do so it
must be understood that all previous
differences have from the moment of
his majestys appointments been ob-
literated

  provarsk arose with an air of relief
bowed deeply to the king eyed kent
quizzically and led die way paulo
still bewildered made his salutes and
followed after leaving the american
with his eyes fixed on von glutz who
had steadily drooped and wilted into an
effigy of injured innocence not unlike
a wilted turnip

  baron kent began all this may
appear a trifle strange to you but i
have reasons

  does it not seem to you mr kent
that you are in a measure taking ad-
vantage of our somewhat singular posi-
tion the king asked i am still
striving to keep my share of our agree-
ment but i cannot quite grasp-

  you arent supposed to grasp any-
thing owing to that agreement was
the concise retort you were and
still are in a passive position its my
job to pull you out im probably
upsetting a lot of precedents but i take
the responsibility for running this board
of directors-pardon i mean this
kingdom-in mv own way

  rebuffed the king met kents look


the blue book magazine

and then reassured by the intelligence
he saw there said j am sorry to have
interfered  am doing the best i can
to learn it requires some patience
under the-the unusual circumstances
to-

  he stopped the confession itself
being difficult but the american liked
him for his outburst indeed he de-
cided there might be some hope for the
king properly handled

   our ways are different he said less
aggressively your way has been
tried and failed therefore mine can
be no worse

i-ie faced von glutz again and was

	 about to speak when as if it were
her particular mission in life to inter-
fere princess eloise came hurriedly
into the room again with full danger-
signals flying

  karl she asked is it true as
provarsk just now informed me in the
anteroom that you have appointed him
chancellor of marken

   it is true the king replied

  then she declared stormily i
suppose this outrage is also due to the
sage advice of your new friend mr
kent are you still the king of
marken may i ask or are you a
marionette pulled by a string have
you gone mad have you no spirit
left

  exasperated by her return as well
as by the contempt that had so deftly
conveyed itself in the selection of her
words the king forgot his promise of
secrecy to the american

  eloise he replied desperately
sheer force of circumstances has for
the time being drawn me into a pact
with mr kent by which he is to have
the controlling voice in the affairs of the
kingdom you forget that without his
efforts we should scarcely be here now
so far he has proven-

  why doesnt he have himself
crowned 

  the king did not answer kent was
amused she stared at him as he sat
noiselessly drumming his fingers on the
arm of his chair entirely self-possessed
and apparently indifferent to anything
she might say

  i suppose it was you then who

appojjvd our enemy provarsk to the

position of chancellor she said

  the king appoints i merely
advise he replied with a smile in the
corners of his eyes that stretched slowly
downward until it created circumflex
wrinkles around his firm lips

  what is to bccome of baron von
glutz she demanded directly to the
point

  	he american slowly moved his head
in the barons direction and assumed a
deep study of that person that caused
the latter to squirm puff his cheeks and
adopt the habitual recourse of tugging
at his mustache

  do you know replied kent slowly
that is the question which has bothered
me a whole lot ive given considerable
thought to him and-er-i hardly know
what to do with him at first i thought
of appointing him the kings dog-
catcher then observing something
faintly suggesting a military character
a regular fighting general behind the
lines-a long way behind-i concluded
that he might make a good minister of
war that is one of the most impor-
tant places in every kingdom of this
kind the smaller the army the more
important the position there is such
a billet as that in marken isnt there
he concluded in a bland tone of
inquiry

on glutz was the first to recover
 from this attack

  when one has been a chancellor it
is rather difficult to step back to a port-
folio he protested

  then why not step out into private
life retorted kent and added with
great enthusiasm it would be such
a change for you  by jove thats the
very thing become a plain citizen
all sorts of things to do opportuni-
ties to criticise the government tell
admiring friends what you would have
done if you had been chancellor point
out the incumbents mistakes get a lot
of figures together to show wasteful
extravagance in expenditures-tariff
reform income tax workingmans
friend poor girls benefactor be a
cromwell and get the power of a king
by having his majestys head cut off
sort of fellow-citizen friend-of-the-
the unknown mr kent



people napoleon and clap the crown
on your bald head you might even
cookize and discover a new north
pole say if youve been a good
chancellor why did the hen cross the
road why was provarsk

  he paused with mock earnestness
waiting deferentially for a reply

  you dont answer he continued
and again that subtle change that dis-
tinguished him was apparent baron
von glutz i respect you for being an
honest man and a faithful one but
there has been a task that you could not
grasp there are many different kinds
of brains in this world yours was not
the kind for the place this one
requires a callosity that you dont pos-
sess you cant cheat or dissimylate
you cant bluff you were not a good
chancellor so ive made you minister
of war do you want the place 

  the baron gave a heavy sigh and
looked doubtful apprehensive lest
he decline the proffered portfolio
the princess hastened to urge his
acceptance

  since there seems no way of disre-
garding our new advisers wishes
baron von glutz i ask you in my own
behalf to accept if you should retire
to private life you would leave me with
one less friend in whom i can confide
there is none left now save paulo
the american did not dispute her
but the king looked at her strangely
and said that is unfair eloise

  she paid no attention to him but
walked to the side of the baron

  for my sake old friend she
appealed and von glutz for whom
kent was secretly rather sorry lifted
his head and said very well i
accept

  good said kent bluntly

lie waited as if expecting the prin-
cess to leave the room but she
divining his wish stubbornly made her
way to a chair and seated herself with
the evident intention of remaining in-
definitely observing this kent smiled
slightly and announced himself

  having thus come so easily through
our reorganization and now being on
such friendly terms of amity and
unity he said we may as well get

down to business and understand what
we propose to do i have studied the
situation pretty thoroughly first we
have army enough now to do police
duty that is what it shall do next
we shall have conscription

  his hearers gave a gasp of dismay

  the trouble with a large majority
of markenites he went on is that
they are lazy they dont produce
enough therefore we will have con-
scription for labor and compel them to
work whether they want to or not if
they dont obey we confiscate their
property and throw them out of the
kingdom im going to compel every
man in marken to earn more money
than he ever has hitherto

 his voice was now hard and
emphatic and he punctuated his decla-
ration by rapping the table with his
knuckles

  im going to make them rich and
the kingdom rich whether they like it
or not when a cobntry is in such
distress as this kingdom is it needs an
autocrat-and by heavens it has one
now those mines shall work full tilt
and this government is going to force
the building of factories and encourage
industries the kingdom of marken
shall not only pay its debts but while
doing it shall learn how to keep out of
debt

  the king could not entirely repress
a look of enthusiasm but the princess
was still rebellious

  and may i ask what role the modest
mr kent purposes to play in all this
miraculous work she inquired

  ive thought of that too cheerfully
replied mr kent ignoring the infer-
ence that he had been boasting some
kings have an official known as the
kings remembrancer whose job it is
to stand at the kings elbow and remind
him of what he has to do i shall be the
kings remembrancer in marken your
royal highness

chapter viii

just prior to the hour of the matu-
tinal sausage in marken on the fol-
lowing morning those who strolled
sleepily out into the narrow streets


the blue book magazine

found a topic for conversation
notices had been posted in the night-
time on the doorways of churches
lamp-posts and pillar-boxes languidly
these were read and a mild flutter
ensued that caused many to forget-
almost to forget-that the sausage-
hour was due

  the notices were printed in plain
white with plain type and plainly
stated that his gracious and benign
majesty karl ii king of marken by
divine right had in the interests of
the great kingdom seen fit to exercise
his august prerogative of forming a new
ministry in the confident belief that his
subjects and the welfare of the state
would therefore be benefited baron
etc etc provarsk was now the chan-
cellor of the realm succeeding baron
etc etc von glutz

  ha said those who read gleefully
the old pouter pigeon has got his wings
clipped or baron provarsk what
does this mean continually he has
tried to make us believe that king karl
is a blunderer now he sides with the
king and becomes chancellor ahem 
we shall see what kind of a chancellor
this high and mighty baron makes

  baron von glutz now minister of
war

  at that they laughed a little and
expressed pity for the few score men
who formed the kings standing army
they hoped the new minister would not
alter the uniforms because those new
scarlet tunics and white trousers
pricked out with profuse gold braid-
ings were very effective

  captain philidor paulo to be minis-
ter of the treasury

  well well well thats some-
thing the common people are at last
beginning to be recognized they
were flattered they remembered
some of them what a merry lad he was
when his widowed mother conducted
the charcuterie in the alley of the
capuchins pity she had not lived to
see her son a cabinet minister what
a lot of money he would have to count
he always was good at counting
stoutly asserted some of the old dames
who had watched his growth

  they discussed it vigorously while
eating they had placid disputes about

  it a the shops opened but they
forgot it by bedtime affairs couldnt
be worse than they had been they
decided and let it go at that

o	n lie fuwing day the shops had
w nice pictures of the new chancel-
lor for sale all of which had been left
by a giant on commission who was
voted a queer son of chap inasmuch
as sometimes he failed to hear or at
least declined to answer this gave
them cause for gossip it being an inno-
vation thus to advertise the face of a
chancellor they did not know that a
more mystified person was the chan-
cellor himself who speculated vainly
on what the fertile-brained king s
remembrancer could have up his
sleeve in this latest divertisement and
not in the least suspecting that it was
for the purpose of making his features
so widely known that he could never
run away

  the court gazette that highly aloof
official organ the smallest paragraph of
which was read with awe proved the
next distraction it intimated that
great changes were about to take place
in the administration of the kingdom
all of which would tend to the aggran-
dizement of marken and would prob-
ably bring it into the rank of first
powers of the world-whatever that
might be elderly gentlemen wagged
their heads sagely and younger ones
unconsciously swelled their chests as
duly become citizens of one of the
great powers the cautious ones
hoped that marken was not going to
plunge the world into war of conquest
and a village oracle who had once seen
the adriatic sea and declared that it
was impossible to see across it because
there was so much water and who had
for twenty years been discredited there-
for as a notorious liar arose again to
prominence and sagely declared that he
believed after long deliberation that
marken was about to have a navy of
its own

  then after a weeks excited argu-
ment there appeared that memorable
announcement that it was the duty of
all to support the state and that at the
places named on the dates named all
able-bodied citizens of both sexes would
the unknown mr kent



appear and register themselves-that
failure to do so would be punished by
fines imprisonment confiscation of
property and various other humilia-
tions also god save the king and
this manifesto was signed by the chan-
cellor this was carrying it too far
the idea of expecting people to do
something for the state why who
ever heard of such a thing of course
anything done for the state was wasted
time didnt they pay taxes wasnt
that enough  things were coming to a
pretty pass anyway two weeks must
elapse before the new conscription
measures became effective and this
they decided was ample time to con-
sider so startling an innovation

  and innovation had been made in the
palace itself unknown to the placid
indolent citizens of the quaint old city
the american after effecting the
organization of the new cabinet was
the cause

  thank you for the invitation to
make your palace my home sir he
said to the king on his majestys
formal reentry into his ancestral
home

  the king astonished inasmuch as
he had never conceived or voiced any
such invitation answered with a whim-
sical smile not too unlike kents own
oh its nothing nothing at all
mr kent it was thoughtful of me
wasnt it

  very replied the new guest it
was very kind of you also to suggest
that inasmuch as a kings remem-
brancer must be a mighty busy man
because a king has so much to think
about that i should select such rooms
of the palace as would serve for busi-
ness offices

  thus he seized a reception-room
overlooking the gardens and a smaller
room that was metamorphosed into his
private office and in a third a staff of
bookkeepers was installed

  it looks said the king to paulo
while making a surreptitious visit
like a bank what on earth can so
many bookkeepers do

  opening a new set of government
books sire under the direction of a
london accountant for whom mr kent
telegraphed

  the king looked helpless and puzzled
and said werent the old ones-
um-mh

  mr kent said all the old books were
mere waste said he would put the
accounts of marken in such shape that
he could tell each night exactly where
the kingdom stood or know the reason
why

  incredible exclaimed the king
no one ever heard of such a thing
that is what baron von glutz told
mr kent

the king grinned and his eyes
lighted as he asked what mr kent
had replied

  mr kent asked the baron if he had
ever heard that -in america there were
now large and thriving orchards of
cheese-trees and when the baron
answered that he had not mr kent
said  there you are you see theres
a lot of things you never heard of
every child in america knows as well
about the cheese-tree as every big cor-
poration knows about the watermelon
whenever possible every big board of
directors in america assembles in sol-
emn conclave and cuts one

  the king looked as if he almost
believed it but he did not disclose igno-
rance having been carefully instructed
on this point when a crown prince

  mr kent has retained one of the
expert accountants sent him from lon-
don as his private secretary- paulo
added as a further note of interest
he speaks our tongue also ivan has
brought all their personal belongings
from steinweg mr kent has also
bought a strange sort of clock-arrange-
ment that he compels the chancellor
and the minister of war to punch in
a curious fashion whenever they enter
or leave their offices mr kent said he
was thinking of getting one for your
majesty this curious device registers
the time when one comes in or soes out
so that by referring to it mr kent says
he can tell whether they are doing a full
days work

  his majesty decided that it was time
for him to retire to his own part of the
palace mr kent seemed to be doing
quite a lot of tilings among others
his majesty learned a few days later


the blue book magazine

was the reorganization of the working
plant of the mining concession effected
by a distinguished mining engineer who
had not only arrived but had tele-
graphed for new machinery that was to
be installed also local engineers had
been sent to make surveys and plans
for electric power-plants at several
places where hitherto some noble water-
falls had been permitted to flow as
nature made them untramineled by
harness

  quarries too owned and long
neglected by the crown were being pre-
pared for reopening on large scales and
the king was further surprised when it
was publicly announced that his
majesty karl ii was heading a scheme
for the utilization of some mineral
springs and would from state funds
establish a spa that it was hoped would
be second to none in europe where
gout rheumatism brights disease and
many other ailments would be promptly
alleviated or cured under the super-
vision of famous specialists

  the king wasnt sure that he liked
it the best he could hope for was that
kent would not have a picture of the
king and his majestys personal
guarantee on every bottle of water
exported

vir kent cause of all the disturb-
ance was happier than he had ever
been in his life he was the first in his
office in the morning and the last to
leave at night the dignity of the staid
old palace was being rudely shaken by
constant streams of those who came on
-business were received by the square-
jawed man who always explained that
he was merely the kings mouthpiece
appointed to transact whatever was to
be done in this particular case and so
forth and thus

  sit down did you bring those
plans well skip all that i whats it
going to cost  thats too much ought
to be shaved by twenty per cent take
those estimates back and go over them
again no use in your trying to fool
the king is there you fellows around
here have got to wake up the king
has been studying over this affair and
knows what it ought to cost just about
as well as you do bring the new

figures around to-morrow at seven min-
utesuast three oclock good day

  eike a gatling gun that voice snapped
and boomed all day long and a close
observer might have discovered that in
the cafes of marken by night and in
the market place by day men began to
speak of the king with something more
than stupefaction something bordering
on fear and respect who would have
ever thought it they muttered no
one ever expected him to do any more
than any other king does and where
on earth would he get workmen for so
many enterprises pessimists opined
that the king was mad and the king-
dom going to the dogs

the days of registration passed with
a good-natured tolerance it was
fairly good sport the markenites
thought quite like some foolish festival
season but why was it that when they
registered themselves they were also
given a physical examination and issued
cards of different colors stating that
they had been assigned to a certain
class it certainly did indicate that the
king was preparing to go to war
and was therefore organizing all his
resources the citizens of the toy capi-
tal of the toy kingdom were vastly per-
plexed but not quite alarmed

  secretly provarsk speculated on what
this bold alien expected of him and
suspected that the sole reason why he
was compelled to keep office-hours was
that a watch might be kept oyer his
activities secretly the new minister of
war fussed and fumed secretly the
king began to hope for the best and
secretly the princess eloise came to the
conclusion that there was some char-
acteristics of the redoubtable mr kejit
that she could not understand fight
as she would she had to admit that he
threatened to do things and exhibited
no slovenliness of mind and for that
she could not help liking him

  and then on a certain day the
curiosity of everyone promised to be
satisfied again the public announce-
ments appeared assembling all of
classes a b c and f at certain cen-
tral points notably one in the market
place of marken and now there would
be but two weeks more of suspense
the unknown mr kent



chapter ix

it was the morning of the day on
which the announcements were to be
made to the citizens of marken that
they had been conscripted for some-
thing far worse than war-namely
work early in the day as kent had
foreseen marken began to fill not only
with those of the classes called but
with members of all other classes
peasants chattering volubly poured
into the capital some on foot others in
carts and all gayly clad in their best
garb there was an expectant and
serious air pervading everything

  the american was early at his desk
and was never more methodical and
energetic this he recognized as a
crisis people he knew could be asked
to go to war and would go cheering
but to ask them to go to work was an
entirely different and more serious
request they might rebel all that
foresight could suggest had been done
the standing army the first and second
reserves had all been called out and
posted in various places where trouble
might occur and baron von glutz
faithful to orders and ever willing to do
his best had puffed and sweated and
bellowed commands that all might be
prepared to quell disorder

  noon was the hour fixed but already
the town was filled at noon they were
to be told the worst

  kent referring to the lists on his
littered desk was jotting down figures
with an air of satisfaction as if to
reassure himself that he had made no
mistakes in his estimates

  a andb to the mines he mur-
mured that fixes them up c men
are carpenters and brick- and stone-
masons and theres enough of them to
care for all constructions and there
are enough f men all machinists to
look after the plants yes that leaves
plenty of common laborers for the quar-
ries must call them up next

irom the window overlooking the
palace gardens came the voice of
ivan the chancellor and his friend
the banker wimpleburst are walking in
the gardens together he said and
turned inquiringly to kent

  by jove is that so ive been
rather bothered about our friend the
chancellor in the last few weeks kent
said hes so uncommonly bright that
i havent been able to get a line on
him

  he got up and came to the side of
the window caught the curtains in his
hand to shield himself from possible
observation and looked through the
meshes

  wonder what the deuce that rascal
has on hand now  its something
otherwise he wouldnt have selected
the garden for the meeting no place
like a garden or a crowded street to
keep from being overheard hes
afraid that walls have ears like an ele-
phants and so they have-under my
especial provision he added with grim
humor

  he suddenly turned and hastening to
his desk pulled open a drawer and
handed a pair of binoculars to ivan

  keep out of sight and tell me what
they say he ordered-after which he
returned to his desk and quiedy lounged
over its corner with folded arms

  ivan grinned adjusted the glasses
focused them at a conveniently thin
place in the curtain design and began
talking disjointedly as if to himself

  wish i could open these curtains
they bother me-when theres two
hundred yards between us hard to
read the lips unless they turn this way
ah theyve stopped and i can see
them both lucky that the banker is
smooth-shaven and speaks distinctly

  he paused for a moment as if pick-
ing up the thread of conversation that
was being unwound across the wide
intervening space

  it seems that provarsk has arranged
with the banker to get together a certain
number of men to create a disturbance
when the announcements are made
provarsk thinks enough fuss can be
raised to stop your conscription scheme
the banker doesnt want it to go as far
as open revolt provarsk laughs says
what if it does banker says that part
is np to provarsk provarsk hopes that
the center of unrest and objection being
the capital it will spread out into the
country says he knows your affairs
are critical and that if you are beaten


the blue book magazine

in this youll either have to give up or
try something else bankers men are
to be posted around different spots in

the market place

  provarsk wants to know how they
are to act unitedly banker says he will
get up close to the stand where the
announcement is to be read then when
he thinks time is right will get up and
give signal imme-
diately a riot will start

says all his men know
one another by a red
cockade in the left
buttonhole provarsk
wants to know if the
banker followed his in-
structions and confined
his efforts to marken
because he thinks con-
centration here is im-
portant banker says
yes all are to be at mar-
ket place banker says
had to pay men four
dollars each in advance wants pro-
varsk to pay him back provarsk
smoothing banker down with his prom-
ises tells him hes to be minister of
treasury some day and not too many
questions asked banker appears satis-
fied the baron has an idea-

li e was interrupted by kent who had
arisen walked behind him and now
took the glasses from his hand and said
never mind the remainder ive only
got an hour in which to move go and
get paulo and bring him back with you
on the jump and hold on a minute
as you go out to get him order my car
brought around and kept in waiting at
the private door also as soon as
youve brought paulo here dont wait
but skip over to your room and arm
yourself and bring a gun for me just
as well to be prepared hurry ivan
weve got quite an uncertain job
after ivan had rushed from the
room kent dawdled back toward his
desk stood above it for a moment care-
fully sorted the lists and papers and
then with hands in trousers pockets
sat on the corner swung his leg and
carelessly hummed a tune as if per-
fectly satisfied with all things only
his eyes betrayed excitement and they

danced as happily as those of a boy just
starting on some wild adventure hut
paulo eager to be of service to
this leader whom he trusted and
admired came through the door kent
lost no time in beckoning him to his
private office where he leaned forward
and mumbled hasty instructions check-
ing them off on his finger-tips and
having them recapitu-
lated to make certain of
their intelligent under-
standing he was quite

leeful when paulo ran
rom the room calling
back leave it to me
mr kent you can de-
pend on me

  kent consulted his
watch saw that it lacked
but half an hour of
noon and locking his
desk twirled the knob
of his private safe he
clapped his hat on his
head and whistled merrily as he
closed the office door after telling his
secretary that he would not return until
late in the afternoon he was exactly
like any other american business man
as he walked alertly to his waiting car-
smiled at ivan and told the driver
another man on whom he could depend
to make his way to the market place

  in the outskirts of the crowd the car
was stopped by an officer who on seeing
the palace uniform worn by the driver
was prepared to give the car right of
way the american dismounted

  permit this car to stand here at the
side where we can reach it when we
return he said clear a way and
conduct my man and me to the platform
where the announcement is to be made
i am on the kings business

  i rccognized you sir said the offi-
cer respectfully and at once called to
two of his men and began conducting
them forward the crowd swayed
commented and drew back leaving a
free lane down which they passed gay
it appeared with all the colors of the
rainbow a strange motley of gorgeous
hues now that the holiday costume was
donned under their feet the rounded
cobbles polished by many feet for many
ages were littered with broken flowers

tinsel from sweetmeats and confetti
any great gathering in marken be-
tokened a holiday sacred or secular
and habit could not be overcome in a
day at the foot of a gray old tower
whose clock daintily veiled with ivy
stared down at the assemblage a stand
had been erected for here from time
immemorial had been read the kings
commands

  it was always the same scene first
the waiting crowd then the kings
heralds brilliantly clad the shrilling of
silver trumpets the silence sometimes
murmuring sometimes breathless and
expectant as befitted the gravity of the
situation while some person of impor-
tance shouted in long-drawn deliberate
tones the kings decree always it
closed with the same statement that
confirmation would be found on the
printed announcements hereafter to
issue and god save the king

  sometimes the people had approved
sometimes they had looked at one an-
other sullenly or humorously and asked
what god should save him for being a
little in doubt on that point and finding
no sufficient reason of their own
legend said that away back in distant
times some of their kings a very few
being those who could read had in per-
son bawled their own decrees but that
had been a long time ago and-well-
the ways of gods anointed were
sometimes incomprehensible to those of
meeker mold an unexpurgated his-
tory now suppressed declared that
ferdinand first while addressing his
loyal subjects had fallen over the plat- 
form-rail because at the time he hap-
pened to be drunk but none dared criti-
cize a king

lent reached the platform and saw
one of his own men there clad as
a kings crier the man looked like a
cross between haughtiness and an
attack of fever and ague kent thanked
the officer climbed to a back seat on the
tiny platform and stared over the crowd
below he observed with satisfaction
that here and there in this crowd there
were tiny swirls and lanes like those of
cross-currents in a sluggish stream and
that every now and then an automo-
bile at the extreme edge of the pool

appeared to have been granted a bur-
den and dexterously whirled away

  a gun boomed from an old fortress
that stood sentry above the market
ilace the old clock in the tower
began a ringing of cracked and ancient
chimes a wooden crusader clumsily
carved and riding a clumsily carved
figure presumed to represent a horse
went rocking around a circle with
creaking jerks met a similar wooden
monstrosity and passed from sight and
a toy rooster opened a door and crowed
as if to impress those below with the
fact that he had a serious bronchial
affection or had lost part of his crow
another effigy supposed to cary the
colors of marken creaked around the
circle and the official announcer got to
his feet and made his way to the front
of the platform

  in the name of his gracious
majesty karl ii king of marken
duke of the trentheim baron of the
oberwald etc etc he announced and
began reading the decree which
stripped of the whereases and where-
fores and constant references to divine
right bluntly told the citizens of
marken the appalling truth  they would
have to go to work

  in the horrified silence it was
explained that a state form of con-
scription had been evolved not for the
purpose of bearing arms but that
workers might be obtained for the con-
duct of various state enterprises the
profit therefrom to be derived by the
state and applied to the payment of its
debts and upkeep-that ultimately the
citizens themselves would receive that
profit after the state debts had been
paid and that the new form of taxa-
tion that imposed by the work of their
hands would abrogate all others fur-
thermore it was announced that certain
factories and public utilities were to be
commandeered and in future operated
by the government acting over and
legitimately protecting the original
owners the voice of the announcer
closed with god save the king and
he took his seat

there had been attentive silence
a while he read out there in the
clear noon under the clear blue sky the


the blue book magazine

markenites listened and struggled to
comprehend then an abrupt murmur
arose to become in a moment a roar
and the american sitting stolidly and
listening attentively caught an under-
note that threatened anger so without
a moments hesitation he threw him-
self forward to stem the tide before
it got beyond control he signaled to
the trumpeters and shouted blow
throw your lungs into it quickly
blow

  obediently the two men trumpeted
for attention kent had jumped across
the platform and shouted into the
announcers ear tell them the king
has sent his agent to explain what the
new conscription amounts to

  in his gorgeous uniform the an-
nouncer again stepped to the front
between the trumpeters gestured them
to stop and raised his hand for silence

  hear ye hear ye he called and
paused until the silence was absolute
that his people may understand his
majesty the king has sent to you his
personal agent to explain more fully
than could be done by royal decree the
objects and effects of he new law
give heed to the kings mouthpiece 

  kent came forward and studied his
audience-which waited ominously

  listen to the kings desire he said
in a big resonant voice that swept over
their heads and through the market
place his majesty has but one
wish to make marken and markenites
respected and prosperous he wishes
to make the title of markenite all over
the world a proud synonym for hon-
esty industry and prosperity

  he paused a moment with his shrewd
senses alert-and decided that he was
on the wrong track when he tried to
arouse them to patriotism instantly
his facile imagination adopted another
course and a momentary sneer flick-
ered over his lips as he shifted to dema-
goguery the fine old method used from
the days of rome to the days of the
present forever effective and invariably
ephemeral but potent for a crisis such
as this

  the king has studied the situation
he believes that the poor are getting
poorer and the rich richer and that the
great throbbing honest frame of man-

kind is about to be crucified on a cross
ot gold down with the trusts give
the honest horny-handed son of toil a
fiance one man is as good as
another and better e pluribus unum
multum in parvo who is to blame  
said his majesty the king after years
of study

  and then like seeing a great white
light he understood it was because
these who had riches no longer worked
but devoted themselves to idle luxury
and looked down upon the real marken-
ites those who with rugged arms
sweat-stained brows and hopeless eyes
looked up to the heavens and cried in
patient agony -how long o lord how
long 

  ground beneath the heel of the octo-
pus wealth those who had nothing saw
about them many who had much but
saw no way of getting any of it many
of my beloved people said the king
produce nothing and will not work
with their hands whilst their brothers
till the fields from rooster-crow to
nightingale-song for a mere pittance i
want said the king-the great sor-
rowing king of this imperial realm-
to know that the workingmans dinner-
pail is full that is what he said

liere kent paused and saw with
  satisfaction that his words were
having effect he went them one better
he lowered his voice to a tone of
pathos rolled his eyes upward shook
his hands up at the clear blue sky and
said in a still more impressive silence

  i would that you could have seen
that great king that governs us all karl
the second whose name shall pass
down through all ages immortal
enshrined in the tender memories of
men as he stood with great pitiful eyes
suffused with unshed tears and cried
the salvation of my people lies in that
simple thing the full dinner-pail and
that this may come about there is but
one way that all men shall work pro-
duce develop and do their share the
richer the plutocrat the more he should
do the poorer the man the more
opportunity he should have to become
independent among his fellows there-
fore each and all shall work as his or
their abilities seem fitted there shall
the unknown mr kent



be no more starvation-wages some
wages shall be increased by the hun-
dredfold and others in proportion
the man who now earns but a kroner
a day shall have two kroners the rich
man shall work with his brothers and
actually earn the same

  thus spoke his majesty the
gracious king will see that work is
forthcoming and the gracious king will
see that no one in all this broad land
shall go hungry to his humble couch
whilst others who have heretofore pros-
pered beyond their deserts shall with
full bellies rest between silken sheets
he paused dramatically and lifted
his hands above his head crossed in a
peculiar manner and instantly a wild
cheer broke out that began in a singu-
larly scattered way but was so insistent
that the people themselves took it up at
last and roared loudly god save the
king long live the king

  kent discerning the same sort of
frenzy that prevails alike in negro
camp-meetings and madison square
political meetings where individuals
yell and shriek principally because the
men on either side are setting the exam-
ple played another fine old oratorical
trick by furiously bawling for silence
and gesturing appeals polite requests
and commands

  no man dares speak against the
kings wish he roared as if intent on
being heard by some one across the
atlantic ocean because his intelli-
gent and wise fellows will understand
at once that such an objector is a dis-
grace to the name of manhood an
obstructor to progress a rebel at heart
and worst of all one who would tram-
ple under foot the grand and noble flag
of labor that sacred standard that has
been followed defended and died for
since time began

a gain kent made that peculiar
gesture this time the cheers were
hysterical in volume and mingled with
them was the roar of firearms as a
group of soldiers stationed at the side
of the market place in obedience to a
command from their officer fired a
blank salvo in the air a man stationed
in the tower banged the cracked bells
and lashed tliem up to a fine imitation

of joy men and women hugged one
another dogs howled children
shrieked with excitement and the
quaint old buildings surrounding the
market place rocked with the universal
ecstasy that intoxicated the marken-
ites now that they had been plainly told
what a wonderful king was this-this
monarch who had come to lead them to
universal riches and therefore to such
a state of plenty that they could buy
anything in sight eat the best there was
to be had and patiently look forward to
an earthly paradise where nobody at all
had any work whatever to do

  the kings remembrancer turned
and winked slyly at ivan and voiced
silently the cryptic remarks made by
many another renowned orator when
closing a successful campaign speech
guess thatll hold them for a little
while come on lets beat it

  like a stem conqueror with head
erect and steady eyes he moved slowly
through the lane that opened wide to
give him egress he seemed not to
hear the shouts of approval or the
cheers of those who paid him adulation
as the one who had spoken for the
king only once he halted in this tri-
umphal progress when his eyes fell on
a puffed-up and self-important con-
tractor with whom he had become
acquainted and whom he thoroughly
detested for his garrulity to him he
extended his hand and spoke the
little man swelled visibly at being thus
recognized by the great man and was
gratified that so many could see this
evidence of friendship

  the people understand murmured
kent confidentially the king told
me they would because he could always
trust to their good sense but his
excellency the chancellor will be
furious because you see he wanted the
king to lower all wages and not com-
pel any of the rich ones to work the
chancellor born to a golden spoon i
am afraid hates the honest sons of toil
trust the king to set him in his place
if he goes too far 

  he gave a lugubrious shake of his
head again shook hands very warmly
and hastened onward

  one for vou provarsk he said to
himself before ive got out of this

square that fat gas-bag will pass it
around with exaggeration and my
worthy little chancellor wont dare
travel without a guard for some time i
reckon hoje they dont catch him and
hang him on sight i

chapter x

in the precincts of the palace on that
eventful afternoon there was con-
siderable apprehension sustained by
the king who bom to precedent and
hedged in by conventionalities believed
in doing all things slowly and with
decorum as kent once said he wtis
as fine a watchful-waiter as ever suc-
ceeded in ponderously doing nothing
indeed there was but one person visi-
ble after kents hasty departure for the
market place who did not seem anx-
ious that person being the chancellor
himself he strolled languidly into
kents office within three minutes after
the american had passed out and
looked for the kings remembrancer
not seeing him he smiled slyly took a
seat waited a few minutes and then
rang the bell that summoned kents
secretary that astute and well-trained
young gentleman entered the room
and stood like a statue of respectful
attention

  good morning your excellency
he said while in the back of his brain
ran the question wonder what that
pusillanimous blighter wants in here at
this time

  i should like to speak with mr
kent announced the chancellor

  i regret to say sir that he is not in
at present replied the secretary with
due deference any word which your
excrllency might-

  when will he be in curtly inter-
rupted provarsk

  probably not until late this eve-
ning was the calm response

  where is he

  i rather think sir that he has gone
to inspect some new work over at the
mines deliberately lied the secretary
but with a convincing air of innocence
and candor that proved his worth as
cither a secretary or a witness before a
congressional investigating committee

 he stood at ease still with that air of
 deference but noted that the chan-
 -fellor after a moments thought was

 undoubtedly pleased

   his meditations were interrupted by
 the entrance of the king who came in
 with more than usual haste provarsk
 instantly rose to his feet but the king
 took one glance at him and frowned in
 lieu of greeting

  your superior-where is he de-
manded the king addressing the
secretary

  he is not in at present your
majesty promptly responded that
worthy

   the king was undoubtedly anxious
a certain nervousness of demeanor
expressed it

  that is just what i was asking
cousin airily interjected the chan-
cellor

   suppose you stop cousining me
the king said eying him with no
attempt to conceal his dislike be-
sides  dont know what you had been
asking few people ever do

   with undisguised enjoyment that he
had succeeded in exasperating the
king provarsk smiled and flicked his
fingers

   oh tut-tut he said what i had
 just remarked was that i thought it
 very discreet of mr kent to remove
 himself on such a momentous day to
 take to the woods i might say lest a
 storm arise

the king turned his back and

	walked toward the door leading out
to the hanging balcony where he stood
gazing off toward the city not in the
least disconcerted provarsk added
with mock gravity i even told him
that affairs were critical and that per-
haps the power of the throne itself had
been cast on an issue of extreme
doubt

   that must distress you terribly
remarked the king with a sneer in his

 voice

  ah good morning your royal
highness provarsk said with great
heartiness and the king turned to dis-
cover that his sister had entered the
room and was now facing provarsk
with a cool stare
the unknown mr kent

 

  karl she asked is it true mr
kent still insists on forcing his wishes
through to the very utmost that
enforced labor measure

  so far as i know moodily replied
the king

  and arent you afraid that- she
paused and looked at provarsk who
declined to depart without direct
orders

  afraid of what the king asked
in a tone of irritation

  afraid there will be trouble
calmly interjected provarsk that is
what the princess eloise means afraid
the people wont submit and why
should they i wouldnt if i were one
of them you can give odds on that
the secretary created a diversion by
discreetly bowing himself backward to
the office door and then through it with
the staid fervor of an automaton the
princess looked at her brother a polite
request to order provarsk from the
room but the king through obstinacy
refused to heed it

  you were about to say eloise he
asked politely as if the baron had not
been present and therefore had not
impertinently added his voice to the
conversation

che had no time to answer for at
that moment there came from the
distance a loud roar of many voices
and immediately afterward the sound
of firearms in ragged volley the
effect on the king was as if some one
had propelled him with a swift kick-
out to the balcony where he gazed
anxiously in the direction of the city
the princess distressed also moved
toward the balcony while provarsk
grinned pleasantly and seemed to un-
derstand the meaning of the sound
he was confident that he alone knew all
that was conveyed by that uproar he
rather hoped that enough markenites
had been killed and wounded to make
his revolt a good one he cocked his
head intently to listen for further shots
heard the distant clangor of the bells
in the city tower and decided it must be
an alarm and then another noise
became audible the sound of some one
hastily coming through the tiled corri-
dors and this latter noise perplexed

him it grew louder and more dis-
tinct and both king and princess hear-
ing it hastily reentered the room

  stentorian puffs and wheezes were
now accompanied by the ringing of
boot-heels and spurs and through the
door galloped the minister of war he
was in full uniform of his own proud
design and the red of his broad sash
was no redder than the red of his face
his eyes protruded and were wide and
his hand was on his sword-hilt so
fast had been his progress and so
intense his excitement that for a
moment he appeared unable to speak
then lie burst out has anyone seen
mr kent has anyone seen mr kent
your majesty oh this is horrible
horrible

  i regret to say sir that he is not in
at present any word which your
excellency might wish to leave will be
duly repeated provarsk said in admi-
rable imitation of kents secretary-
and then added my goodness its all
fussed up isnt it

  everything is lost exclaimed the
minister of war speaking to the
king

  what has happened asked die
latter quietly confronting an issue that
brought out his better fighting qualities

  mr kent he told me that he pro-
posed to put the decree through regard-
less of anything and that if i had to
fight fight it would be-told me to
have my army stationed at places
named but said he would be there and
that i wasnt to give die command to
fire until he told me to creat crowd 
people all excited and restless acci-
dentally dropped my glasses and
stepped on them and ive lost the
oculists prescription

  youre rattled said the king
growing still cooler now that he faccd
an emergency

  so i am  so i am admitted  nn
glutz hastily but i couldnt see mr
kent anywhere and the crowd grew
threatening i asked if any of my
officers had seen him no one had i
hurried here to inform him and on the
way i heard shots it can mean but
one thing-that pressed to the limit
my soldiers have fired and that mar-
ken is in a state of civil war

he paused for want of breath and
the king clenched his hands and
made as if to go to the front himself
then he whirled and asked sharply if
he told you to stay there in command
of the troops who is in charge now

  general handers

  the king hesitated but the princess
asked stormily did mr kent say you
were to kill the people if a disturbance
resulted 

  von glutz in his turn hesitated try-
ing to recall his exact orders

  on signal from him he replied

  karl karl she called some-
thing must be done at once this will
never do you must act regardless of
your promises to this american now
this comes you see from your putting
yourself into the hands of such a
man

  emboldened by her criticism of the
dictator baron provarsk thought he
saw his opportunity and assumed an air
of extreme honesty and distress

  the princess is right he declared
to the king it is time to cast off such
an incubus before the kingdom itself
has gone to the dogs

  the princess recognized his presence
for the first time

  what do you mean by that  she de-
manded regarding him sternly

  it nettled him to an unfortunate re-
tort

  i mean that the only way in which
affairs can be straightened out is to at
once counteract everything this fellow
kent has done and if i had my way he
would be taken out and shot before the
day is over

  at his callous indifference to either
justice or life she gasped and eyed him
with a wide stare provarsk wondered
if in overlooking the complexities of
a womans mind he had not made a
mistake but he was still daring to hope
to turn the situation to his own advan-
tage if i am to be an actual chan-
cellor- he began suavely but he was
cut short by the princess

  which no matter what happens
you are not to be and so of course all
talk about it is useless you would
have mr kent shot you why the
worst blunders he ever made are sure
to be better than the best things you

 have ever done you have told what
 you would do if you had your way
 well ill tell you what  would have
 one if i had mine id have you
 booted into the street and through the
 market place kent whatever else
 mr kent is he is a man no matter if
 he has made mistakes and is a money-
 lender and all that he is still a real man
 and unafraid who are you to talk
 about having him shot

 che faced her brother as if her last
 contemptuous gibe at provarsk had
 been her final one for him and saw
 that her brothers eyes were fixed on
 the door and that von glutz also stared
 in that direction with a look of relief
 she also turned and saw that the
 american had entered the room and
 was now coming gravely toward her

   i overheard your royal highness
 he said and i thank you for your de-
 fense i had not hoped for so much
 and i am grateful-very very grateful
 -for a friendship that i esteem as of
 great worth

   she was visibly embarrassed and
 took refuge in a diversion

   what has happened in the market
 place she and the king asked in
 chorus

    its a terrible situation wheezed
 von glutz

   kents eyes flickered as if he now
 understood the cause of the assemblage
 in his reception-room

    in some ways he said but i dont
 see how i could have acted dif-
 ferently

   why didnt you- began the prin-
 cess impatiently and then hesitated and
 looked at the king

    will the princess please finish the
 american asked i wish you would
 extend your friendship to the point of
 advice what would you have done

    first of all i should quell the riot
 it comes from misunderstanding
 there are no kindlier nor more ame-
 nable people mr kent than ours
 they should not have been fired upon
 at ail

    he stood quietly to one side listen-
 ing attentively as if all his own plans
 had been defeated

    i dont see why we waste time talk-
-------

the unknown mr kent	

ing now the king declared impa-
tiently

   please sir allow the princess eloise
to proceed kent said her sugges-
tions might be valuable he turned
his face toward her and encouraged
her by asking and what then  after
the riot is quelled

  then they must be dealt with kindly
but with resolute firmness it will not
do to seem to give in to them they
must be made to obey but there can
be a compromise of some sort can
there not this new plan was too un-
expected too drastic it would have
been better to have prepared them
gradually that would have been my
way mr kent

  she stopped in expectation of his
defense and gazed at him with sym-
pathy and regret as if wishing to assist
him in any way she could now that his
plans all energetic all hopeful had
gone awry she had never by word
until this day credited him with any
virtues

  thank you he said quietly lifting
his fine eyes to hers i applaud your
firmness its like encouragement from
a friend to hear you talk but i think
after all that my way was the best
something abrupt and sensational had
to be done to arouse them i did it
it worked all right

a ll in the room fixed him with looks
 of interrogation and suspense the
chancellor emitted a sarcastic you
certainly did

  and now weve got a revolution
grumpily muttered von glutz

  kent was still watching the princess
and had opened his lips as if to explain
the situation to her when ivan came
striding into the room stopped and
would have retreatea when he saw
those present had not kent halted him
with a gesture

  well ivan kent asked have
you gopthem all right now

  yes sir captain paulo said to tell
you that the last of them had been
rounded up and that all of them are
now in jail also that he had followed
your instructions and ordered an hour
of free refreshments in the name of
the king the market place is filled

now with people singing the national air
and shouting their heads off for his
majesty theyve wrapped a big ban-
ner round the dock-tower that reads
at last we have a king in marken
god preserve his majesty karl the
second 

  kent calmly grinned at provarsk
whose face had grown black as an au-
gust thundercloud the king looked
bewildered and vastly relieved von
glutz exclaimed god help us what
does it all mean- and the princess
eloise broke into a surprised and grati-
fied smile	s
kent again faced ivan and asked
and by the way did you learn what
they have to say about our most noble
provarsk

  ivan grinned broadly and with
marked enjoyment said yes most
of the things they said i cant repeat
but i should think it would not be very
wise or safe for his excellency the
chancellor to be seen without a strong
guard for a few days or until this cele-
bration blows over on that point they
dispute among themselves-some being
in favor of tar and feathers while the
others insist on hanging

  you remember of whom you are
speaking roared provarsk betrayed
in spite of himself into an unusual dis-
play of anger

  if necessary said kent eying him
ill see that you are handed over to
the mob in the market place within the
next ten minutes and with the word
that the king agrees with those who
want to lynch you

  you asked my advice  few minutes
ago mr kent the princess broke in
with  malicious little laugh let me
offer it send him down there now
regardless of whether lie has anything
more to say

drovarsk controlled himself and
 was again the polished self-
contained and fearless man of the
moment he brought his heels to-
gether and bowed very low toward the
princess

  to be hanged by your royal high-
ness wish would be happiness to me
he said

  come come weve had enough


the blue book magazine

of this it seems to rue said the king
if mr kent will but relieve our
suspense by explaining what took
place-

  very easily done the american
replied with die utmost calmness 
learned that a combination had beeij
effected between a certain number of
men to provoke a riot at what they be-
lieved a suitable moment it was to be
such a row that it might become a
full-grown revolt i therefore took
measures to see that each one of these
hired iambs was shadowed by a guards-
man i could depend upon the prin-
cess eloise will be delighted to know
that these guardsmen consisted of
former adherents of a petty baron
named provarsk who have taken serv-
ice under me personally money paid
into an itching palm at regular inter-
vals and in sufficient sums does make
some men loyal these fellows swear
by me

  he diil not look at the discomfited
provarsk who affected an air of the
utmost indifference and stared absently
out toward the garden

  so kent went on when the hired
disturbers started their outburst each
one was instantly clapped on the
shoulder and carried away to a nice
sccure litde place protected by iron
bars i gave the people a treat talked
to them myself and was-ahem
received with marked enthusiasm the
firing you heard was prearranged by
me it was a salvo of joy fired with
blank cartridges the ringing of the
bells was also arranged by me to give
due dramatic effect the feeling of
love for the chancellor was also stimu-
lated by me i pointed out that it was
he who signed the harsh decree en-
forcing labor and suggested that only
the unswerving efforts of his majesty
the king had ameliorated what might
have been a most heart-rending condi-
tion of toil we turned the proposed
revolt into a celebration of joy and
enthusiasm for his majesty who is
probably at this moment the best loved
man in marken

  the king threw off royal dignity and
impulsively tried to express his thanks
but seemed to have trouble with his
throat

as if to relieve himself from an

     embarrassing position kent sud-
 denly swung round toward provarsk
 and fixed him with mocking eyes

s by the way chancellor lie asked
 n a casual tone isnt the hanker wim-
 biehurst a friend of yours

   it seems to me that i am acquainted
 with the gentleman provarsk replied
 not in the least perturbed

   too bad too bad said kent
 he was die leader of the disturbers
 he was the first one  had arrested and
 put in jail to-morrow he shall be de-
 ported and all his property escheat to
 the crown

   dreadful person said provarsk
 with a slight grin

   kents eyes lost all mockery and
 stared harshly at provarsk with an un-
 mistakable menace

   take care your excellency lest
 you overwork and the cares of state be-
 come too great for your zeal it would
 indeed be pitiable if you were suddenly
 compelled to join that estimable gentle-
 man your friend the banker in an
 equally penniless state

   provarsk did not waver he sniffed
 disdainfully and with the utmost polite-
 ness asked  am i to understand that
 this is a command for mv departure 
 not at all why should it be
 kent retorted with cynical courtesy
 oh no indeed you are too good a
 thing to lose sight of

chapter xi

 nearly three months later the
 various steel manufacturers of
 the world were stirred and
 agitated by the announcement that the
 redoubtable john rhodes had again
 been heard from and in a most un-
 satisfactory way the manganese de-
 posits of which there were but two or
 three of any size on earth had been
 secretly bought in or concessions
 gained therefor and word came from
 the blithe john rhodes dated from his
 london offices that hereafter man-
 ganese would double in price steel
 manufacturers swore volubly but the
 market went soaring some of the
 manufacturers used cables and wires to
the unknown mr kent



find out if that deposit which was said
to exist in a dinky little kingdom called
marken was open for sale lease or
concession 

  the replies provoked renewed pro-
fanity inasmuch as they tersely said

nothing- doing concession already

  held by john rhodes	kent

  and the steel industry of the world
threw up its hands in horror and was
compelled to submit to unheard-of
prices for a commodity that was indis-
pensable for all manganese steel
richard kent smiling plaintively in his
offices in the palace found much cause
to feel well satisfied he had made
good with john rhodes for life for
on his judgment john rhodes was
making a killing kent could now
see the way not only to repay rhodes
all the money advanced to marken but
in addition thereto was enjoying himself
to the uttermost in the development of
his big machine of state enterprise

  ive put marken on the map you
can bet he confided to paulo a
year ago mighty few people had ever
heard of it to-day its known every-
where and theres a nice crowd of
icings here in europe who have a
hundred times more power but who
are sick with envy marken markets
on manganese are quoted daily all over
the world thats going some

   daily also the american was giving
the king lessons in finance that made
that dreamer take a new interest in
life the royal automobile no longer
hooted over the drives because the
king was too busy poring over the
books which kent had caused to be
opened for him kent assured the king
that in due time he would be made into
a first-class accountant he also sug-
gested at times that it would be a fine
tiling for her royal highness to study
stenography and typewriting so she
could assist inconfidential matters  but
at this the k-fng drew the line paulo
had already succumbed and became as
busy an office man as any concern might
wish von glutz had been burdened
with the department of highways and
railways and could be daily seen in-
specting steam-rollers and consulting

with traffic officials and the chancel-
lor was the only man about the palace
who was entrusted with nothing at all

  it began to be rumored that the king
of marken was due in time to make die
distinguished prince of monaco look
like a deuce-spot in the financial world
meanwhile richard kent hustling
scheming sat in his den and pulled
wires from morning to night and
remained the least known man on the
scene the markenites liked him and
called him familiarly the kings
errand-boy a title to which he made
not the slightest objection

rut the princess eloise was
troubled prior to that day in the
palace when the throne seemed rocking
on its stately legs the american had
striven for her friendship she had
disapproved of him with an intensity
that shecould notnow understand he
had lashed her with gentle raillery he
had dared to command and subdue her
and then after the day of her brave
championship when she had wished to
be his friend and ally he had cultivated
a studious and aloof politeness

  her brother too had become this
mans admiring slave and appeared to
enjoy with him a friendship that was
constantly increasing in intimacy and
he was amazingly improved by this
contact for now he moved with a con-
fident air as if no longer uncertain of
himself the improvement was not
without another change that she was
not certain she liked for her brother
no longer carried himself with the
august dignity of a king but had
fallen to the americans carelessness of
dress and dislike of functions he for-
got to change clothes several times a
day and formed an affection for an
ordinary sack suit which she observed
with horror was gradually bagging at
the knees

  and worst of all he was eating like
a workingman-as if he wanted no
amenities and only food plain deteri-
oration she thought it also his con-
versation had undergone a subtle
change he no longer talked of the
standard topics of royalty such as the
weather reports from the last yacht-
regatta and the court scandal of


the blue book magazine

neighboring kingdoms instead he
waxed enthusiastic over another elec-
tric power-plant of the possibilities
of all taxation being remitted owing to
national prosperity of old-age pensio
and how a new way had been found to
increase production and lower costs of
this or that by kent always kent

che sought that staid old gentleman
the minister of war for consola-
tion  blit here again she was rebuffed

 haw haw haw roared von
glutz one cant attend to all things
your royal highness of course none
of us are as polite as we used to be
havent the time no indeed

  there is time for civilities isnt
there she demanded hotly and the
red-faced old man became grave

  eloise he said i trotted you and
karl on my knees when you were
nothing but babies i was chancellor
under your father your grandfather
used to pat my head when he met me
in these gardens out here now listen
 want to tell you something in all its
history there has never been a marken
like this its a kingdom now it is
going to be able to buy and sell a lot of
its neighbors it is respected it pays
its bills its bonds are away above par
-among the best in the world if it
wants more territory it doesnt have to
go to war to get it it can buy it out-
right 

  he even slapped his fat sun-tanned
hand on his knee to emphasize his
point and added we were all mis-
taken it took a kent to show us how
he is a great man eloise a very great
man-the greatest that ever came to
marken why do you know i was
angry when he used to call me a dodder-
ing old fool and now i know he was
right i like it i do

  he threw his head back proudly and
defiantly he the dignified stately old
chancellor admitted that he was pleased
to be called a fool so long as it was this
phenomenal alien who called him that

  she ended that interview by lifting
her head in the air and passing from
the room and she reddened with
annoyance when she thought she heard
from behind her a soft chuckling
noise

then came the worst shock of all

   the king had actually gone with
bag-kneed trousers ink-stained fingers
and all accompanied by kent only into
the city and attended an evening band-
concert in the market place and most
undignified had been the consequence
for the people recognizing him had
given him an ovation and with locked
arms escorted him home to the very
palace gates when mortified she had
reproached him for this lack of dig-
nity the king had casually replied
to the deuce with it ive got
something that beats all tliat and from
now on im going every night i can
find time what ive found out is that
the people like me there was a baker
down there and his name was pete
sort of a man of affairs i think who is
on the city council and lie made a
speech in a cafe it was and i had
to make a speech kent says i did well
says ive got them all buffaloed what-
ever that is says ive got the makings
whatever that is of a fine orator and
next week im going to a banquet given
by the ironmongers guild and kent
says that after this when theres a de-
cree to be read he wants me to go and
read it myself he says im a-what
is it that he calls it in english oh
yes im a good mixer kent says ive
got to learn how to get acquainted with
everyone and yet keep my dignity
says i must never let anyone talk about
royal affairs but that i must make them
feel that they can come to me when
they are in trouble says i can get
them so that they would die to the man
if i asked them to

  rank democracy  she exclaimed
all right call it that if you wish
but i tell you i am learning that the
way to make men do things for me is
to make them do it because they wish
to and not merely because i happen to
be a king he answered with emphasis
and then she realized that the change
had been greater than she had seen
and that her brother had thrown aside
all the precedent that had made the
dynasty a mysterious potency because
this money-lender had shown a new
way she shuddered with apprehen-
sion when alone she resolved to
make further efforts to understand this
the unknown mr kent



strange man kegt and if necessary
check his aggressions

co it was that the american in his
 private office one morning was told
that her royal highness the princess
eloise waited in the reception-room
he responded at once and stood before
her with his grave air of attention

  mr kent she said smiling up at
him i have come on affairs of state
he wondered mentally what this
dispute could be about but said
courteously i am of course at your
royal highness service

  his steadfast calm aloofness both-
ered her

  why is it that you do not make use
of me

  make use of you make use-i
scarcely understand

  yes make use of me i am the only
one you do not employ you have my
brother converted to your creed baron
von glutz is working harder than he
ever did in his life captain paulo has
no time for anyone or any other occu-
pation than his own affairs i am the
only one left out surely i am as much
interested as anyone and surely there
is something i can do i came to learn
what it is

  his face relaxed into a warm smile
that was his chief charm a smile that
forever came unexpectedly that dis-
played his firm white teeth that brought
little wrinkles to the comers of his clear
eyes then as if studying the face of
a child he looked at her with an odd
kindliness and approval she was the
first to lower her gaze and could not
understand why she suddenly felt like
a small girl appealing to a very great
man

  will you not be seated she asked
and heard him obey she did not look
up until he began to speak and there
was nothing of ridicule sarcasm or rail-
lery in his musical voice

  there is much that you might ag
princess eloise if only you under-
stood but the barrier between a prin-
cess and her people the common people

i mean is-well-its a mightly hard
hurdle to take i dont know much
about such things i wasnt brought up
exactly as those of royal families are

you see i graduated from a sawmill
outside of lumber-kings and soap-
kings and others of that sort we
havent any kings in america the
way i look at the situation here is this
first we had to make marken honest
and prosperous to do that we had to
make people work make them all gc-t
their shoulders to the wheel and shove
in the same direction that far we
have got

  next so that the people may keep
shoving for all they are worth we have
got to get closer and closer to them-
got to make them loyal to marken and
its ruling house because they want to
be so people can be forced to do things
for a while by law but that wears off
some time people dont have to be
forced when they do things through
respect and affection they do them
because they want to-because its
natural for them to do so our task
now is to win their affection without
losing their respect you could do
some very good work in that direction
it would help materially it might
some time your royal highness avert
a serious crisis

  you mean she asked earnestly

  i mean that in the past there has
been too much royalty here and not
enough people that the time has come
when a-a very small place like mar-
ken must begin to wear its clothes dif-
ferently when its royal house must
stop trying to ape the emperors and
kings and czars of great and powerful
nations must drop the royal-splendor
pretense and begin to make itself a
power in its own way on new lines and
let all others think whatever they please
and be perfectly indifferent to what
they do think youve got to forget
that you are a princess and try to make
friends out there

  every one of those women working
in the fields every girl out there of your
age has just as many perplexities and
sorrows and hopes and ambitions as
you have theyve got just as much
right to live and to hope doubtless
some of their sorrows and some of their
hopes would seem ridiculous to you
doubless a lot of your sorrows and
hopes would look equally ridiculous to
them so if you wish to help and i

know you do or you wouldnt be here
now you must go out among them and
establish a new line a common ground
whereon their difficulties no longer
seem trivial to you and yours no loader
ridiculous to them

  find a way to rub shoulders with
your people theyll not contaminate
you youll make it a whole lot easier
for them get to know their names
help christen their babies learn to
advise learn lo accept advice make
them feel that you are not only a prin-
cess but a woman as well why the
proudest title any man ever had in my
country princess eloise was given to
a ruler when they commonly called him
old abe everybody knew who old abe
was and the reason it was the finest
title was because they gave it to him
from their hearts a nation fought
when he asked them to a nation wept
when old abe died

come great pathos in his voice un-
suspected from such a man some
prodigious seriousness impressed and
subdued her as she listened this was
not the money-lender here was one
who had pulled the curtain from the
alcoves of his mind and exposed there-
in something so noble that it brought
her a princess to her knees a glimpse
had been given her of a fair landscape
beyond all that she had ever seen
fairer than she had ever seen tenderly
appealing wrarmly alluring like unto
the dream of parsifal-a land through
which she might not pass save through
nobility of spirit alone she was
crushed by a sense of littleness of
unworthiness the american had
arisen to his feet and she felt his glow-
ing eyes she arose confused by the
swift tracery of her thought and stood
before him with bent head and hands
clasped before her she spoke still
under the spell of the dream invoked by
bis clear insight but could only stam-
mer i am trying-am trying mr
kent to see and i understand now
-and i dont blame you-for despising
me

   had she looked up then she would
have observed the swift look of pain
that swept across his face and his
struggle to hold himself in leash just

for an instant and then curbed by his
relentless will it was gone and he was
merely the quiet inflexible and kindly
man regarding her with serious eyes

  i did not say that he rebuked her
you asked what you could do to help
i tried to help you you must find the
way i canl  dont understand
women and because of this i have
most always avoided them  do know
men ive had to ive made my way by
knowing them and after all  may be
mistaken in my ideas sometimes 
think they are foolish but it seems to
me worth thinking over princess
eloise and ive learned that by think-
ing hard enough one can almost always
find a way i hope you can because
you see you could do a heap of good
this place were in has no jobs for
cripples or pigmies

  she glanced at him to reassure her-
self that he was not again mocking her
but she saw nothing beyond the utmost
candor in his look yet she was secretly
pleased to discover with a womans
intuition that he felt awkward and em-
barrassed she proved merciful to him
and to herself by uttering a single sen-
tence

  thank you she said i promise to
try

 he bowed deeply to her as she
walked from the room without looking
back and then for a long time stood
with his hands in his pockets and
glowered out over the roofs and spires
of the city dimmed and empurpled by
the evening glow

chapter xii

it was spring again and as if the
change of weather or the indefati-
gable work of winter had worn
him to laxity kent sat in his private
office for once idle the king wear-
ing another business suit that had also
assumed bags at the knees cam
hurriedly in and closed the door behind
him

  hello said the american swing-
ing around to greet him whats up
you look worried

  i am was the kings reply as he
threw himself into a chair and wiped
the unknown mr kent



his brow ive got the worst of
news

  where did you get it asked kent
with a grin that the king did not re-
turn

  down in die village he said two
or three of the men i have made friends
came to warn me i listened and came
back here as quickly as i could to talk
it over with you provarsk has been
undermining us again

  kents eyes twinkled and he settled
back into his chair and lighted his
pipe

  is that so he exclaimed without
excitement well what do you think
you ought to do about it

  do i cant do anything without
your consent and you wont give it i
wanted either to have him tried for con-
spiracy against the state or throw him
out of it two months ago you wouldnt
consent you said something about
giving the calf rope enough to hang
itself and did all you could to assist
him by gradually giving him more
power

well has he hanged himself yet
hanged himself of course not
hes trying to have us hanged
how asked kent with that same
air of quiet enjoyment that did not at
all please the king

  by surreptitiously making the
people discontented he has them be-
lieving that working the mines the way
they do is an injustice that from the
mines i am getting rich but that all
the other state institutions are scarcely
paying at all its useless to tell them
that they are all profitable-

  save one slyly interjected kent
that free bath-house is a complete
failure it has required all the means
at my command to keep people from
knowing it the mineral springs turned
to salt more than six weeks ago

  the king showed his surprise
well then-why-why didnt you
close the place up i didnt know
that

  true said kent with the same easy
demeanor i dont suppose you did
know it i havent told anyone and
theres not a man working there who
isnt a confidential employee of mine i
had reason

  but we have made money out of all
the other state enterprises asked the
king anxiously

  out of every one of them marken
whether it wants to be or not is due to
become one of the richest nations per
capita in the world



lie laid his pipe to one side and
leaned toward the king in a brisk
business attitude

  listen he said and ill tell you
what it means the time had come to
eliminate mr provarsk the very
reason we kept him here in the first
place was either to give him a chance
to make good or to fix him so that he
would be forever harmless well
weve had to take steps to do the lat-
ter

  the king shook his head and said
i dont see how

  when we opened up the state enter-
prises we permitted anyone to buy
stock in small blocks didnt we we
held control only provarsk tried to
bribe my secretary to give him inside
information as to what ones would be
the most promising and to which ones
we would give the greatest support
my secretary told me already i had
decided to drop the mineral-water-re-
sort project because it couldnt be made
to pay i had my secretary take pro-
varsks bribe and then tell him that
the mineral-water company was to be
our biggest winner provarsk through
straw men and in divers ways bought
and bought until every dollar he could
rake and scrape is in the venture he
owns forty-nine per cent of the proj-
ect which isnt worth ten kronen the
minute that state support is withdrawn
and the reasons made public now do
you see it all 

  no i dont admitted the king
thoughtfully what has that to do
with a fresh disturbance among the
people 

  kent laughed amused at what he re-
garded as the kings denseness

  why just this he expects to
arouse the people to a point where they
will demand a big share in the profits
of all enterprises-perhaps the abso-
lute relinquishment of state control and
ownership then those who hold the


the blue book magazine

controlling stock in the best enterprise
will find themselves rich he thinks
he has the best one

  pshaw you havent understood

me declared the king sobejv i
said that he aims his efforts at the

mines

  quite true replied the american
in that way he kills several birds with
one stone he thinks he upsets my
house of cards on one hand and builds
his own with the other also he
embarrasses you because he knows that
you dare not tell the people of marken
that you have given john rhodes a con-
cession for these mines and that al-
though they have been getting big pay
they have been enriching you as well
as paying back john rhodes money
the eople themselves have been help-
ing to do it

   cant agree with you quite stub-
bornly insisted the king why the
men who work there are getting double
the wages and sometimes quadruple
that they ever before had in their lives
they are prosperous-prosperous be-
yond any hope any of them ever had
you dont mean to say that prosperous
men are the ones to revolt

  nothing more certain in the world
too much prosperity is just the same if
not worse than too much poverty an
autocrat i have come to the conclusion
-can make with fair luck either one
or the other too much wealth or too
much poverty and the end will always
be the same-they will get rid of the
autocrat who is the most obsolete being
on god almightys earth there are
times when one seems a necessity but
the moment that necessity vanishes so
floes he three very great nations in
this world proved it great britain
france and the united states some-
times i think the others dont count

  but we must stop provarsk in-
sisted the king desperately

  you leave provarsk alone he is
doing just exactly what i foresaw and
what i want him to do

  for a moment they stared at each
other and the king was vexed

   come said kent seriously havent
i accomplished nearly everything i have
undertaken  have you lost by my sug-
gestions think it over

the king thought then as abrupt-
ly it all recurred to him his
own desperate condition when first
he met this man the startling innova-
tions the progress they had made their
friendship and above all the strength
and independence that this alien had
taught him he was ashamed of his own
doubts he made frank confession
kent the king said im still a-
what you call-a chump

  nothing of the sort remonstrated
the american youre all right only
you dont do things the way i do and
i think that when it comes to handling
rogues my way is better than yours
now see here this is what is going
to happen i am going to make our
choice chancellor believe that he has it
all his own way going to give him a
lot more authority going to be blind
ai d deaf apparently dont you inter-
fere ill let you know when i want
you let him stir up his revolt it
can take but one course that of de-
mands because it is far too late for him
to dare to do anything against
your majesty personally why if he
harmed a hair of yours or your sisters
heads or suggested such a thing they
would take him down into the center of
the market place and bum him at a
stake and when the demands come
up its got to be up to you youve
either got to give or refuse and may
heaven help you if you blunder i
shall decline to advise you the time
will then have come when you must act
for yourself and be your own adviser

an hour later the king with an
anxious but resolute look made his
way to his private dressing-rooms to
prepare himself for a court reception
in which he was to be invested with a
decoration from a neighboring monarch
who hearing of the wealth of marken
was on the eve of asking for a loan and
also opening negotiations leading to a
marriage between his eldest son and the
princess eloise

  provarsk who had accidentally met
the kings remembrancer in the corri-
dors was being complimented by the
latter on a manifesto that the chancellor-
had issued without authority and told
that inasmuch as all old hatchets had
the unknown- mr kent



been buried there was no reason why
the chancellor should not really assume
more power and do what he could to
assist in the nations welfare provarsk
smiled gleefully when he left the kings
remembrancer likewise the kings
rembrancer smiled they met once
more that day when in the palace gar-
dens the chancellor self-confident
came upon kent and the princess
eloise he paused to pay her his
respects which she accepted with cool
politeness

  i learned a few days ago that your
royal highness had joined the others
of us in the efforts for the good of the
kingdom-er-got money to build a
hospital for women or something like
that subscription lists all closed grand
hurrah and all that

  so she retorted in a calm drawl
you are as nearly correct as one could
expect i havent joined an effort be-
cause i have made the effort it is true
that there is to be a hospital but not
true that its cost was raised by subscrip-
tion i am building it out of my own
private funds and the women of mar-
ken have gratefully agreed to support
it

  he laughed tolerantly

  oh theyre grateful all right-for
anything they can get for nothing

  an angry retort was on her lips but
she caught a warning look from kent
and remained silent disappointed in
his failure to exasperate her provarsk
took a fling at the american

 your methods are much better mr
kent you make them earn what they
get and at the same time take good care
to get yours

  to be sure i do kent agreed
heartily that is your great weak-
ness baron your philanthropy you
should take a lesson from me and learn
how to secure your own profits first
i am trying to prove an apt pupil
the chancellor responded ive always
wanted money you have taught me
several ways of getting it

  quite possible declared kent al-
most with enthusiasm

d rovarsk pleaded the necessity
for greeting some one and after a
very low bow to the princess and a

light salute to the american sauntered
away she stood with a frown on her
face and watched him kent after a
moments wait laughed quietly

  isnt he fine he asked i rather
like that chap if he could only run
straight he might go a long way hes
got the assurance of a pet tomcat and
the persistence of a flea and i dont
believe he knows what fear is

   f hate him  exclaimed the princess

  that never pays its a waste of
time he declared-and then suddenly
shifting the subject said will you per-
mit me to congratulate you on your
hospital plan  it is something that has
been needed here i have been watching
your work you have done as i
thought you might-found that com-
mon ground between the women
of the kingdom and yourself and
you have done it alone and unadvised
i am afraid you were a little too liberal
though it must have strained your
private resources

  strained them she said and then
laughed softly it did more than that
mr kent but i didnt want to do it
by halves and the more i thought over
it the more i became enthused and-
there we are

  was it worth while he asked
quietly and staring at her profile which
against the darkness of the foliage
looked pale under the swinging fete-
lamps above them

  she turned toward him in a frank
outburst

  yes more than worth while and
i owe this new world of mine to you
i started badly i must tell you to be
really honest that i came to you that
day through pique i saw that you per-
mitted nearly all the others to be friends
with you but barred me out i wanted
to be your friend too i couldnt come
to you as the others had because i had
insulted you and mr kent if you
knew half how much i suffered and
despised myself for my insolence and
rudeness i think you would take pity
on me and forgive

  i have nothing to forgive he de-
clared stoutly you said nothing more
than the truth you called me a money-
lender i am you said i came here
to keep john rhodes from losing his


the blue book magazine

money i did neither of us should

be ashamed of the truth

but what of all the other things you

have done she asked curiously

  the others dont matter i have
advised your brother as best i could
because  liked him lie has wtry line
ideals me has become a goo king
and in time will become a great one
it was in him all the time but he
needed some one whom he trusted to

five him plain horse-sense and shape
lim to practicality  dont really see
how i could have acted differently

  he gives you far more credit than
you take she said i think sometimes
 am a little jealous of you he talks
of you so much you and his work
have absorbed him and  am neglected
-treated like a child no longer advised
with or consulted they all treat me
that way now not even baron von
glutz or paulo can spare me a minutes
time i want to be something more
than a doll-baby in the affairs of
marken

  you are he assured her earnestly
they recognize the part you have
undertaken they believe it as im-
portant as anything they are doing
you must not bother them keep a stiff
upper lip and hoe your own row well

  the princess gasped it was the first
time she had ever been told to keep a
stiff upper lip and strangest of all
she enjoyed it

m early two weeks later the prin-
a  cess again sought kent and this
time she was in a state of angry alarm
she did not wait to be announced so
urgent was her haste to speak to him
she scarcely took time to respond to his
friendly greeting

  ive got news-terrible news she
exclaimed desperately it was told
me by three different women wives of
men who work in the mines provarsk
is stirring up a revolt on the new lines
he is encouraging the men to demand
a share in the profits of the mine and
leads them to believe that if they can
win this step they can get anything
they want

  she paused for breath and was sur-
prised that her news had so little effect
on the american

    hank you he said for coming
to tell me about it but  knew a

a ready

  and you are calmly letting him go
ahead with this vile campaign m

  she could not understand such
complacency

   i es he said in fact i am sur-
reptitiously encouraging him want to
see just how far he can go things
have been rather dull around
here lately provarsk promises some
entertainment

   he stared at the floor and his face
softened

   its great he declared before she
could find speech positively great
i knew you had it in you by jove i
knew it

  she feared something had gone
wrong with his mentality and with an
anxious bewildered question strove to
bring him back to realities

  what do you mean great i was
talking of provarsks treachery

   i mean he said slowly and un-
reasonably embarrassed that you are
great why just think of it princess
eloise you were told the news by the
wives of three men who work in the
mines dont you sec how you have
won them-the wives of the men who
work in the mines would any of
them have done so six months ago
did any of them six months ago care
enough for you the royal princess to
be alarmed when anything threatened
you or your house

  she had not considered it in that
light before there was a change and
it had come so gradually so impercep-
tibly that she had been the last one to
recognize it somehow this knowledge
that there were those in marken who
cared for her for her own sake gave
her a greater sense of security and
bravery than she had ever known

  come he said gently what harm
do you think a man like provarsk
capable of now why if i wanted to
take the trouble i could start whispers
throughout the kingdom to-night that
the real reason for his plotting is that
he intends to seize the throne and exile
your brother and yourself and the
people-yes-the very ones that he is
now stirring to make foolish demands
the unknown mr kent



-would tear him to pieces and feed
them to their dogs

   but why not do it she demanded
with all the eagerness of a conspirator

   because he said slowly i dont
want it done that way i want to
punish him in my own way-also be-
cause i enjoy watching him just to
learn how far he is capable why if
he can succeed we ought to walk out
it would show that we are a lot of
incompetents if any other women talk
to you of him just tell them how grate-
ful you are and forget it provarsk
must have no inkling that i suspect him
i want that much understood when
the time is ripe-we shall see

  after she had gone the american
sat for a long time alone and staring
absently through the open window as
if made very happy by the knowledge
that at last the princess was a real ally
then smiling he sent for von glutz
who happened to be accessible and
told his secretary that they were not to
be disturbed

chapter xiii

a strange lassitude seemed
to have overtaken kent in
direct contrast to his old
habitual energy he now loitered
habitually taking long walks alone
dreaming alone like a man who finding
his task done has no further ambition
and devotes himself to useless medi-
tation for weeks he appeared apa-
thetic-so much so that the king and
the others of that little cohort whose
activities he had directed and stimulated
were gravely concerned they sug-
gested that he needed a rest that he
must be ailing that it were better if he
sought change and to all these sug-
gestions he smiled gravely and shook
his head

   its  like this explained ivan to
paulo in private conference there is
something on his mind some trouble
some worry that none shall ever know
i cannot understand it-i who for
years have been his shadow his right
hand his friend of thought and service
he has not confided in me which in
itself is strange were he a youth i

should say he was involved in a hope-
less love-affair but being what he is a
rock a being as independent as the
poles of the globe i cannot conceive
what it is that has overtaken him
and all the time angrily asserted
the minister of finance that provarsk
plots

  it was true and kent as well as
his adherents knew it for kents
sources of information brought him the
constant and unanimous reports that
the chancellor was adroitly using his
time the managers of the mines
stated that the men were becoming
daily more intractable and sullen that
nightly meetings were being held from
which no information ever leaked
and that there was a growing unrest
there was no room to doubt that pro-
varsk was behind it all and that
provarsk was carefully laying a pow-
der-train to cause an explosion yet
kent the master spirit of change read
the reports or listened to them and was
lethargic

   baron von glutz the new enthusiast
for road-improvement slipped hastily
away to the outer world to inspect some
new road-making machinery kent
smiled at his enthusiasm paulo went
to the other side of the toy kingdom to
inspect work connected with his depart-
ment again kent smiled and seemed
happy to be left alone and unmolested

a nd then when least expected pro-
varsk acted with his customary
boldness kent walking alone in the
garden late one night and absorbed in
thought was abruptly startled by a soft
crashing sound in the laurels on either
side and suddenly realized that he was
in the midst of a huge thicket where if
it came to a struggle he would have
hut small chance he whirled with
the intention of running to a better
field but his foot caught on a rope
that had been tied across the path and
he fell headlong

  a man crashed throth the bushes
on one side and threw himself on kent
before the latter could regain his feet
he gathered his big powerful body
that had in youth been inured by hard
work and hard battles with lumbermen
and threw himself quickly to one side


the blue book magazine

broke the hold on his arms with a sharp
wrench and rolled on top of his

assailant

  kents hope had been to get to
his feet but the man beneath
disappointed in one way took advan-
tage of another and shifted m hold
to kents neck instantly another ad-
versary caught the americans heels
and jerked his legs from under him so
that he sprawled at length on the man
in the path kent lifted his arm to
strike and another man seized it
strongly and clung to it kents left
fist struck this new assailant and
elicited a grunt then while he was
trying to land a second blow another
man was added to the corps of assail-
ants

  kent fought so well that it took the
best efforts of the four men to subdue
him-after which he was immediately
handcuffed and lifted to his feet

  whats tlje meaning of all this he
demanded

  it means that you are under arrest
growled a hoarse voice bring him
along men

  but where are you taking me
kent insisted

  youll find that out soon enough
was the reply

  kent walked doggedly along in
silence and without further protest and
was led directly to the private entrance
to the palace and thence upward to his
offices where despite the warmth of
the night the shades were drawn and
the room in a blaze of light as soon
as his eyes were accustomed to the
change he beheld through the open
door of his private office provarsk
lazily seated in his private chair and
saw that the drawers of the desk had
been wrenched open and that numerous
papers were scattered on the floor

  ah  got him did you  the gian-
cellor remarked t the soldiers con-
ducting kent you did well couldnt
have done much better in fact but i
was rather in hopes he would fight
sufficiently hard to make extreme
measures necessary

jdrovarsk smiled pleasantly and
came into the other room kent
looked at the men around him and

sneered when he discovered they were

some of provarsks original merce-
naries now become double traitors

  	however it is just as well that you
didnt have to knock his brains out
the baron continued  find that the
iapers which are accessible are-not
exactly those  wanted perhaps mr
kent will oblige us with the combi-
nation of his private vault

  bless my soul what an over-
sight  kent exclaimed youve not
got the combination thoughtless of
you but by the way it would do you
no good this evening anyhow baron it
has the best time-lock i could buy

  the baron walked over to the vault
and inspected it and it was evident that
he was not familiar with such a modem
device

  suppose you broke that clock off
he inquired of kent

  then even i could not open it the
american replied you may be cer-
tain that the vault will not open until
after ten oclock tomorrow

  in that case all you can do is to give
me the combination said provarsk
eying kent insolently

  for two centimes i wouldnt kent
replied

  and for two centimes if you didnt
id throw you into a wet dungeon with-
out food until you did provarsk
promptly retorted

  by jove i believe you would said
kent admiringly and that being the
case i suppose i may as well give it
to you

  exactly replied the chancellor
little courtesies will be duly appre-
ciated

  ive noticed that you were appre-
ciative kent said meaningly  but
inasmuch as im here and you are there
i dont see what else i can do but
oblige  f you and my good faithful
friends here are not afraid of me per-
haps you would kindly request them to
remove this jewelry otherwise i cant
write

  provarsk smiled at what he thought a
sarcasm and asked the leading soldier
if kent had any weajions on being
assured that the american was un-
armed the chancellor ordered the
handcuffs removed

v
the unknown mr kent



  and let me caution you mr kent
he threatened that any attempt to
escape or call for assistance may neces-
sitate action on my part that i should
regret to take furthermore it would
be useless on your part because there
is no one in the palace who would
attempt to assist you save the king and
his royal sister both of whom are now
slumbering sweetly-with a guard out-
side their doors

  kent looked about him as if seeking
some one provarsk divined his look
and added and that bear-man of
yours has also been taken in and i
believe is now nicely secured in one of
the old dungeons i hope one was
selected where there are plenty of
rats

i-ent looked at the leader of the
mercenaries who stood stockily by
him and whose protruding eyes batted
themselves at intervals and were devoid
of expression

  hes got to be taken out of that
dungeon kent said emphatically

  to quote one of your own phrases
nothing doing retorted the con-
spirator

  all right nothing doing in the
combination line either stubbornly
returned the american

  provarsk grinned at him with the
kindliness of a hungry wolf but influ-
enced by his prisoners fearless stare
paused to consider

  ill tell you what ill do said kent
ill compromise you have your
friend put ivan in a comfortable cell
and ill not only give you the combina-
tion but my parole ill agree that you
can take me to my own room and that
iu not leave there without first notify-
ing you that i intend to do so hows
that

  this is to be a gentlemans agree-
ment is it kent  provarsk asked

   it is

  all right the conspirator replied
ill accept it whatever else you are
ill admit your word is absolutely good
give me the combination

  kent walked across to his desk sat
down and with a steady hand wrote it
on a piece of paper blotted it and
passed it to provarsk the latter

smiled lazily and turned to the leading
soldier

  x have heard the agreement he
said see to it that we keep our part
have that ivan put in the most com-
fortable place of confinement we have
take mr kent to his room and see
that he is not disturbed of course he
has no objections to a guard outside his
door

  not in the least kent assured him
i like it keeps me from being lone-
some sort of soothing in the dark
now before i retire would you mind
telling me what you are up to this time
and what its all about 

  not in the least said provarsk
with the same air of courtesy that was
in itself akin to insult what i am
up to is first olall to get rid of you
im going to put you out of the king-
dom and also ive taken steps to cut
your claws i secured the address of
your employer john rhodes at 
regent street london west yester-
day and wrote him enclosing corre-
spondence showing that you had not
only made overtures to sell his conces-
sion to me but had actually transferred
it to me for a cash consideration which
i presumed was with his sanction i
explained that my object in writing was
to have him remove you to other scenes
of commercial activity because you
were personally obnoxious to his
majesty the king and also to me the
chancellor needless to say the cor-
respondence i sent him proving the sale
of the mining concession was signed
by yourself-unmistakably so

  kents eyes opened with genuine
astonishment this was a more adroit
invention than he had credited pro-
varsk with being able to devise he
had written to rhodes and-

  you forged my name to those
letters eh he asked hotly well
before im through with you ill-

  do nothing you cant you are
helpless ive got you this time my
smart yankee friend and got you in
such a way that you cant escape
when i kick you out of marken you
can take your choice be tried by john
rhodes as a defaulter and convicted on
my evidence that the letters are genu-
ine or put as much distance as you can


the blue book magazine

between yourself and your employer
that is immaterial to me either way

  but-but the king he will not
submit to it declared kent on the
defensive

  the king pouf tlc king will
do as i say after this otherwise ill
send him trailing along after you in
short order

  kents face was impassive

  take him to his room and let him
think it over ordered provarsk with
a grin good night mr richard
kent i hope you have a very com-
fortable rest i may call on you in the
morning to assure myself of your
comfort

cor once astonished at the mans

	ingenuity kent turned and led the
way out with never a word provarsk
had proved a better enemy than he had
believed him to be he could but think
of the letter and enclosures to john
rhodes and remember that the finan-
ciers reputation was that of being an
inflexibly hard and unrelenting man
whenever one of his underlings had
proved delinquent he tried to recall
whether john rhodes had always
been just in such cases perhaps poor
barry who had been sent to an amer-
ican prison for something similar had
been a victim of some other provarsk
and simmons the englishman when
led f rom the dock to serve his sentence
of three years hard labor had pro-
tested his innocence to the very last
and both simmons and barry had
been master agents entrusted with
great transactions enjoying intimate
acquaintance with john rhodes kent
looked very grave and preoccupied as
they escortcd him through the long
resounding corridors of the palace

  his guard halted and opened a door
kent walked through and closed it
behind him he was alone in his accus-
tomed room with his problem and
then it occurred to him that there is
such an influence as justice and that
justice will not be denied there was
the king the king though it cost him
his throne-though it cost him every-
thing he prized in the world-would
under such circumstances find and con-
front rhodes and declare it all a lie

and rhodes under those circumstances
would be compelled to believe

  kent disrobed bathed the dust of
that stiff physical contest on the garden
path from his face and climbed into
bed to-morrow was merely to-mor-
row to be met as his judgment dictated
within ten minutes he was sleeping as
soundly as if nothing mattered and he
were but a tired boy

chapter xiv

kent breakfasting in his room
heard not only the singing of
birds in the garden but a
persi stent and increasing monotone
of sound that pervaded everywhere
caused by the shuffling of many feet
along the streets outside the palace
walls the indistinct hum of many
voices the grating of cart-wheels over
the roads and an occasional shrill call
rising above others the atmosphere
itself seemed charged and ready for a
single spark to cause the explosion of
revolt he heard some one coming
rapidly along the corridor the guards
heels coming to a salute then the door
opened and the king entered his whole
personality radiating indignation

  this is an outrage he declared
i found a guard in front of my door
this morning who told me of your
arrest and confinement to your room
he made no objection to my coming
here and so i came at once we will
go immediately and have provarsk
seized come

  kent slowly shook his head

  i cannot he said i am under
parole of honor to remain here

  the king stood aghast

  you gave your word to that
treacherous-

  yes and shall keep it

then i will at once go alone and

  no no let us consider kent
checked him

  but-but it may mean revolt how
do we know that he has not bribed or
overcome enough of the guards

that 

no fear said kent easily some

of them perhaps but i have certain
the unknown mr kent



reason to believe that on baron von
glutz return there will be a-a change
in the situation

  but kent kent are you mad
demanded the king time time is
against us you dont know what is
happening what do you think of
this he cried thrusting a paper
toward the american

  kent took it said have a seat
your majesty and read it was a
proclamation with all official seals and
form calling upon the inhabitants and
especially those employed in the man-
ganese mines to assemble in the market
place at eleven oclock of that day
where communications of the utmost
importance to their welfare and the
welfare of the state would be made
kent read it slowly to himself gave a
wry twist to his mouth and looked at
his visitor

  i observe he said with quiet mean-
ing that it does not end quite as royal
decrees customarily do it does not bear
the words god save the king 

the king who had been twisting
impatiently on his chair ex-
claimed no it doesnt i noted that
point

  when did this appear the amer-
ican asked recalling the hour when the
attack had been made on him

  it was posted up by the chancellors
orders between one and two oclock this
morning the guard told me so

  the guard then was friendly
yes and very much distressed he
apologized to me and said that he could
but obey his orders-that he could not
understand i called him inside and
closed the door and told him to tell me
all he knew he did he says that
provarsk has won over some of those
adventurers he first brought here and
that they have been talking to all the
others in the guard-room

  did this man get any inkling of pro-
varsks intentions

  yes enough to cause him and all
the others that are loyal to be highly
alarmed these passed the word
around that they believed they could
best serve the throne and you by obey-
ing up to a certain point they wish to
know what to do

  but provarsks intentions inter-
rupted kent bringing the king back to
the point

  provarsk is going to announce this
morning that the mining concession has
been turned over to him wrested from
you and john rhodes in behalf of the
people by him and he will promise that
hereafter the profits shall be shared by
those who do the work after that he
proposes to inflame the people to dem-
onstrate in force and demand of me
that a like course shall be pursued with
all other state holdings and that those
which the state does not completely
own shall be returned to the original or
minority owners to be run hereafter
without state interference my guard
gathered all this from stray talk made
by provarsks henchmen who already
certain of success are beginning to
boast of the authority they are going
to have

  kents eyes glowed with interest

  that guard of yours he declared
is due for a good commission after
this is over i seem to have overlooked
him he meditated for a moment and
then to the kings surprise as if vastly
relieved leaned back in his chair and
laughed

  amateur work after all he de-
clared im disappointed provarsk
had me guessing last night i thought
he was a much cleverer fighter than i
had believed him to be he always
boggles in the end

  i dont see the joke exclaimed the
king but more hopefully

  why it is this way explained
kent -plain as day now he poses
as a national benefactor but no one
would be able to tell if he did actually
get possession of the mines what the
profits are he probably would divide
up some of the profits as long as it
served his purpose and after that 
he snapped his fingers derisively in
the meantime he insures my being
driven from marken and forces you to
turn over everything that produces an
income-also to let government-con-
trolled private industries revert to those
private individuals who own the outside
stock that includes the marken min-
eral springs in which he has invested
every dollar he has in the world and all


the blue book magazine

he could borrow its so easy now
that its scarcely interesting

  but the people dont know that yon
have the concession objected the
king they think i still own the
mines for the state and that the protits
have been turned tt the redemption of
the state bonds anthey are confident
that after the bonds are redeemed im
going to spend more money for the
good of the state the minute pro-
varsk exposes the whole affair they
will lose confidence in me and my
intentions

  the american regarded the kings
distress with sympathy

  but suppose you had never granted
the concession and that you did own
the mines free from everything

  as soon as your bonds have been
met id give them the profits-all of
them you certainly know that i do
care for my people and am unselfish
i want to be just what they have
thought me to be kent the best king
that marken ever had i want to be
able to do again what i have done walk
out among them and know that they
respect me as a king and like me as a
man and a friend

ie spoke impassionedly voicing the

	hunger of his mind confessing his
dream while the american watched
him kindly as an elder brother might
watch the anxieties of a younger one
when about to tender sympathy and
assistance

  all right he said bluntly i
think we can fix that up it may be
foolish on my part-but a man cant
pass through this world without being
foolish once in a while im going to
give you that concession

  the kings face expressed many
emotions among them solicitous
affection

  but-but rhodes he asked ex-
citedly what will rhodes think
ive got to take my chances of
squaring it with him most always he
does about as i want him to ive
made a lot of money for john rhodes
one time and another and he knows it
besides im going to tell you some-
thing the last penny that marken
owed john rhodes together with two

per cent interest was paid him more
than a week ago if after all that he
kicked hed be more of a dog than 
ever suspected him of being

  the king stupefied by the news that
he was free from debt gasped but
kent disregarded him he got up and
locked the door to make certain ihat he
could not be disturbed walked briskly
across the room to a bookcase and
spoke with the proud delight of a boy

  come here he said i wish to
show you something pretty clever i
call it my own idea ivan and i did
most of the work now look over here
on tliis side of the room right under
the mantel-see this marble ornament
well its nothing but a plain common
electric latch-the kind we have over
home when we live on the top flat and
wish to open the ground-fioor door for
a caller push on it

  the king still speechless did so
there was a sharp click and the book-
case swung away from the wall
exposing a modern safe behind it the
kings eyes were wide with curiosity

  thats the way she works kent
exclaimed proudly thought it out
myself for emergencies i havent
kept any papers of importance in the
vault of my office for more than three
months id give a hundred dollars to
watch provarsk when he opens it with
the combination i gave him last night
its quite empty

  he chuckled as he bent over and
twirled the knob pulled the heavy door
open brought out a drawer and took
from it a piece of paper that the king
recognized kent opened it and
glanced at it to make certain of its
identity held it before the king to show
what it was and then deliberately tore it
to shreds which he threw into the fire-
place and lighted

  there goes the concession he said
gazing at the flames the manganese
mines are yours unmortgaged free
from all debt and all obligations

  he turned with a warm smile on his
face and silenced the king who began
remonstrating

  ill tend to my part of it he said
its up to you to do yours let me
handle the situation here you must
rush back to your rooms summon the
the unknown mr kent



heralds get into your state glory so as
to be more impressive than solomon
and hurry down to the market place
he consulted his w-atch

  youve no time to lose if i were
you id not let them know but that you
personally summoned them youd
better go now and whatever you do
dont let provarsk know youve been
here

  he fairly shoved the king toward
the door hushing his protestations of
gratitude with a gruff we can talk
about all that later not now not
now hurry

  he carefully closed the safe and
swung the bookcase back into its normal
position after which for some min-
utes he stood scowling thoughtfully out
over the garden as if formulating new
plans  then he walked slowly across to
the door and opened it

  id like to speak to you he said to
the guard come inside

the man hesitated looked up and
a down the corridor and grinned
kent was secretly pleased and knew
that he was not mistaken in his surmise
that one who had always been ready to
betray for money would do so again to
the highest bidder the man entered
and closed the door behind him with a
look of cupidity in his eyes

  you are out for money kent said
brusquely im going to make it worth
your while to go at once get my man
ivan and bring him here you can tell
the sentry its provarsks order if you
do that within the next fifteen minutes
you get five thousand francs in gold and
no one the wiser can you do it 

  the man took another look in the
corridor seemed satisfied and said
how will you pay me

  you know that i keep my word
dont you kent retorted i tell you
ill pay you the minute ivan gets here
the mercenary hesitated scratched
his head and took the plunge he ran
on tiptoe down the hall kent hastened
to his secret safe and took therefrom
some rolls of coin and waited his
bribe was effective for within the time
ivan appeared and the guard took the
bribe-money with a chuckle and left
them alone

  ivan kent said in the soundless
speech he employed when they were
alone i rather think that within a
short time provarsk will be here and
our interview may not be pleasant go
into my dressing-room there and leave
the door ajar sufficiently to observe
what takes place if he gets ugly i
may need you

  i understand said the giant nod-
ding his head and i shall be there if
needed is that all

  yes replied kent thats all and
ivan be wary of him if you do have to
come out i dont believe that man
likes you  pon my word i dont and
if he could he might try to hurt you
ivans mouth opened into a wide grin
as he went to kents dressing-room and
pulled the door carefully shut save for
a tiny crack kent paced restlessly
about the room pausing once to admire
absently as he had done a hundred
times before the intricate carvings of a
huge wooden screen that formed a snug
little corner time was moving and
he wondered why provarsk did not
appear for he confidently expected him
had that astute gentleman discovered
the counter-move that was being made
against him and taken steps for its
circumvention 

ytth brisk elation he heard a tap
 on the door and when the sentry
entered looked expectantly over his
shoulder confident that provarsk was
there

  her royal highness the princess
eioise announced the sentry and the
american was troubled as he bade the
man open the door for her anu himself
moved toward it

  she entered hurriedly and closed the
door behind her her anxiety and
excitement were marked

  tell me she said hastily advanc-
ing what has taken place karl had
no time he told me to come here and
ask vou why is there a sentry 
princess eloise he said quietly i
m under arrest by provarsks orders
but your brother and i have taken steps
that will render him very harmless-
she looked at him with pronounced
consternation that was augmented
when he added -steps also that ren-


the blue book magazine

ler my remaining longer in marken
unnecessary- so i shall soon be going
in the midst of such an emergency
i do not believe it will be an emer-
gency very long he said gravely
and i do not believe that after to-day
 shall be needed therefore i expect
to leave marken within a few days

 but you cant she insisted
desperately

  a slow change came over his face
the change that his intimates in big
affairs would have called his poker
face a face that would be wooden
regardless of whatever depression ela-
tion craft or plan passed through his
mind

  nevertheless he replied quietly
i am going

  surely not she expostulated i
dont believe it its as if you were
beaten-were running away
perhaps it may look that way-
now he said watching to see the
effect of his words

  the princess distress increased
her hands came together and he saw
that her slender fingers had interlocked
as though by this grip to obtain
strength for repression he would
have given all that was his to have
caught them in his own strong palms
and to have comforted soothed and
reassured her but he dared not he
had schooled himself to the knowledge
that from her viewpoint he was but a
capable money-lender possibly a good
friend while she was that product of
nurturing and breeding a princess
royal his rebellion at this condition
brought out a trifle of that controlled
savagery that made him strong

 why should i stay here any
longer he asked when all i came to
do is done i have paid john rhodes
every cent of his money that was my
mission was it not-that and nothing
more

che lifted her head and regarded him
with astonishment his immobile
face bespoke no inward hesitation-
nothing but calm purpose he was
inscrutable she sustained a conflict
of emotions but all her respect and
liking so slowly upbuilt were wounded
by his words

  i thought she said hesitantly
that you had remained for something
more-than that  thought friendship
a liking for a great work a happiness
in doing something worth while had
been reasons

  he smiled but did not answer she
interpreted his silence as an admission
that she had been mistaken in her esti-
mate of him and that he had been
imbued with nothing but selfish mo-
tives she spoke regretfully now and
he saw that her reserve was breaking-
saw that she was giving way

   thought we meant something to
you my brother and  and i tried to
be worthy of what i thought you were
 believed you to be the greatest man i
had ever known karl would have
done anything for you i would-

  she paused twisted her fingers still
harder and then looked at him with eyes
like those of a hurt child candid out-
spoken in humiliated confession

  i would have given anything to have
you be my friend as you have been
karls she paused bit her lip and
then impetuously clenched her hands
and with sheer recklessness added i
would have given much more-to have
helped you-always if you had failed
and been beaten honorably fighting i
would have liked to go to you and put
my hand in yours and walk with you
in defeat i was sick of illusion-of
sham royalty-of polite lies  i wanted
your esteem  yours  all of it and
now i despise myself for it 

  she stopped choked by her own
humiliation and looked at him but his
eyes were on the floor his hands hang-
ing listlessly open his heavy shoulders
and stalwart frame inert and passive
as if all she had confessed and all her
scorn were not capable of moving him
for a long time she stood thus quiver-
ing while he stood dumbly before her
the chirping of birds in the sunlit gar-
dens outside the slow measured foot-
steps of the sentry in the corridor
without and that ominous distant hum
of marken itself came to them accen-
tuated in volume by their own silence

mumbly like one astounded by
 some overwhelming surprise he
lifted his head-she saw his eyes all
the unknown mr kent



the old bravery was gone from them
gone too all the old mockery the old
readiness of response the quick accep-
tation of ever-changing chance some-
thing in their great seriousness in their
very depths made her catch her breath
she saw that he was humbly yet des-
perately fighting to speak that words
were being sought and that none
satisfied

  there was a clamorous insolent note
added to that murmuring diapason of
sound that swept monotonously through
the room the sound of some one clank-
ing his way through the outer corridor
it stormed his ears like the call of a
trumpet announcing battle it whirled
him back to his own sphere of action
where men were to be met where a
fight the fight he knew as a veteran
was imminent his hands shot for-
ward and caught hers and his big body
became endowed with a suggestion of
bent steel alive ready to spring he
was the master again

  listen he commanded her his
words crowding one upon the other
go quickly behind that screen and sit
down hurry sit there and hear
what is said say nothing my honor
in your eyes may depend upon it-and
that-is more to me than everything
else in the world

  he caught her by the shoulders in
his strong hands whirled her bewil-
dered across the few steps intervening
thrust her into an easy chair behind the
screen and was out again toward the
door through which provarsk was
entering and which he locked behind
him she heard kents voice cool
casual greeting his sole opponent

  well it said ive been expecting
you have you opened that vault
yet

drovarsk laughed-but not with
   mirth

  yes i opened it and found just
what i rather expected-nothing
disappointed queried the amer-
ican with cool insolence

  not much came the ready reply
with equal coolness the way you
passed the combination over was-well
significant

  suppose we sit down kent sug-

gested weve got quite a lot of
things to discuss havent we

  that depends on you of course if
you are quite amenable-i seem to be
in the position of strength-ill listen
to anything youve got to offer

  youll listen  thats good if you
only came to listen why did you come
at all say provarsk you dont
think im fool enough to believe you
came here merely on a polite visit do
you just because you wanted to hear
the sweet sound of my voice you
came because ive got things you
want-things you think i might trade
things that if you dont get might upset
your little pile of bricks and tip you
over into the gutter come lets not
try to play blind-mans buff what are
you after what card do you need to
fill your flush

  pretty fair talk for a man who is
shut in his own room under arrest
commented provarsk what is it the
english call it-swank  yes thats it
bluff i think you style it you
yankees

   not at all kent insisted seriously
a real bluff is where you havent got
the goods but try to make the other
fellow believe you have swank on the
contrary is merely an exaggeration of
what you possess neither word is
applicable because ive got what you
have to have i under arrest pouf
thats nothing because ive got what is
known as the moral supremacy the
initiative also because you are afraid
of me and that i might possibly kick
your apple-cart with a lot of freckled
wares into the garbage-pile

  good gayly responded the baron
quite good nothing like frank
admission to get to a business basis is
there you can make it a lot more
certain for me and in return i can at
least make it certain that you shall have
a chance to wander farther afield with
a whole hide

  and if i dont prove agreeawe
questioned kent

  then declared the conspirator
with a great air of regret i am afraid
you wont wander anywhere at all
about the cheapest thing in marken is
a lot in the cemetery

  hm mused the american if


the blue book magazine

you are so certain of your ground 
cant quite see why you bother with me
you wouldnt do it no indeed youd
order the lot

  right again cheerfully agreed the
baron

  well then lets get down to brass
tacks what are you after

-t ie baron got up and began to move

	about the room much to kents
disturbance

  sit down he said i dont like to
talk business to a man who is running
a race with himself

  provarsk sat down and came straight
to the point

  i can get your transfer of that
mining concession whether you give it
or not he said meaningly

  in the same way you got my signa-
tures to letters i never wrote eh
exactly admitted provarsk with
a grin but it might save some fur-
ther trouble with your employer john
rhodes if i actually got the transfer
from you

  i believe you are right about that
kent agreed but you havent yet
explained where i come in im not
fool enough to believe you are doing
this for the good of the state you
know

  of course im not provarsk de-
clared contemptuously im doing it
for my own good and no ones else
how do you propose to handle the
king demanded kent

  hell have to do what i want him to
for the simplest of reasons that i shall
have the people behind me hell get
nothing he can be king thats
etough for him

  yes said kent invitingly now
about me you have already written
to rhodes do i get nothing too 
thats just what im coming to
observed the baron youve been a
good gamester but youve lost all the
way round you and i agree on just
one thing-which is that either of us
keeps his word when he can do so
thats right isnt it

   yes i think it is

  then if i gave you my word as a
gentleman on anything youd accept it
wouldnt you

   think i should

  very well that simplifies matters
the king has been getting ten per ccnt
ol the net revenues from the mines
f rom now on he gets nothing and you
shall have five per cent hereafter to
be forwarded to you wherever you
choose to hide from rhodes provided
that you give me that concession only
of course youve got to stay away from
marken thats understood in any
event

yyith a studied air of deliberation
vv kent looked up at the ceiling
until provarsk began to move rest-
lessly

  the latter consulted his watch and
got hastily to his feet

  ive no further time to waste in
politeness he declared with sharp
emphasis i shall give you just five
minutes more in which to decide

  why this haste got anything
important to do asked kent in bland
surprise

  i have asserted the baron crisply
well provarsk you can spare your-
self the trouble said kent with the
utmost sarcasm i know your full
plans i even surmised you might try
to seize me and instructed yon glutz
who by the way will be on hand with
sufficient strength to act this very morn-
ing that unless it became a question of
saving my life he was not to interfere
with you with die exception of per-
haps a half-dozen men the palace guard
is still loyal and awaiting my orders i
could have summoned assistance last
night with a single call

  provarsk looked incredulous he
concealed the fear that slowly gripped
him and snapped his fingers

  bluffing again he said come
my time is up

  going to read a proclamation to the
people or anything like that if so
you may as well save yourself the
trouble  by this time the king is
already reading his

  provarsks face at this statement
went white with rage

  you lie he shouted

  i dont calmly disputed kent in
his turn arising to his feet ive
already returned him his concession
the unknown mr kent



and he is by this time presenting the
manganese mines gratis to the citizens
of marken another thing you
neednt worry about what john rhodes
might do to me i happen to be john
rhodes myself you are-

there was a shout a curse a

	womans scream and a pistol-shot
sounding together in confusion pro-
varsk infuriated had whipped a gun
from his pocket so unexpectedly that
ivan had not time to reach him but
the princess had with desperation
flung the screen heavily against pro-
varsks arm and the bullet deflected
from its mark spattered itself in minute
particles of flying lead over the tiled
floor outside the sentry battered
clamorously on the stout door in the
debris of the screen two men now
struggled furiously-ivan and pro-
varsk the latter striving with desperate
intent to twist his pinioned hand once
more in kents direction and swearing
that no matter what happened he
would at least kill him his persistence
angered the giant who had seized his
forearm and now threw him to the
floor

  with a roar like that of a charging
lion ivan seemed for the first time to
exert his full strength he was un-
swerving and pitiless his huge right
shoulder suddenly lifted until the mus-
cles of his neck were swollen and rigid
there was the harsh snap of breaking
bones an agonized scream from pro-
varsk and kent leaped forward

  ivan ivan he shouted forgetting
that the latter could not hear the
princess backed away against the wall
with a stare of fascinated expectant
horror for ivan with all the hatred he
had sustained for the chancellor un-
leashed was intent on killing him this
time regardless of kents entreaties
he snatched the pistol from the floor
and despite kents efforts planted the
muzzle against provarsks temple he
tried to discharge it but in his haste
had unwittingly thrown the safety
clutch provarsk helpless beneath him
glared upward with eyes that did not
quail

  the curious reckless fearless daring
of the man did not desert him in the

least now that he was at the end kent
caught ivans arm in both his own but
the enraged giant threw him off dex-
terously dropped the pistol caught it
by the muzzle and lifted his arm high
above his head intent on crushing pro-
varsks skull with the butt of the
weapon

quick as light kent saw his oppor-
tunity and caught the upraised
wrist from behind threw all his weight
against it and slowly bent ivan side-
wise from over his victim the giant
though taken at this disadvantage
yielded only inch by inch overborne by
the strength of kent a strength that
with any ordinary man would have
been overpowering kents jaws were
set until the muscles of his cheeks shone
in knots and his eyes were aflame

  let me kill him for gods sake
dont interfere ivan shouted and
then still pleading for the privilege of
destroying provarsk was toppled over
breathing hoarsely and looking up into
kents face slowly the red flame
burned out of his eyes as he recovered
control of himself the pistol fell from
his hand and the princess with a
spring as graceful as a leopards seized
it and retreated to a safe distance

  promise me that you will not hurt
him ivan i tell you not to are you
mad man

  i promise said ivan sullenly but
relaxing himself and kent arose
ivan got slowly to his feet with a stare
of hatred and defeated intent at pro-
varsk who was painfully trying to
extricate himself from the pieces of
splintered screen

  kent put his hand firmly but gently
beneath him and assisted him to his
feet and then to a chair there was
no need to ask his condition the
loosely swinging arm told its own
story

  the door gave way under a fresh
onslaught and several guardsmen fell
into the room behind them could be
seen two others holding provarsks
mercenary between them kent smiled
grimly and said thank you men 
but i do not require your help pull
whats left of the door shut and at once
go and arrest or kill provarsks hired


the blue book magazine

nen leave one man on guard outside

in case i want him

  they saluted and obeyed with con-
vincing alacrity

  provarsk said kent im very
sorry i didnt wish that done to
you

  thats all right rhodes or kent if
you prefer it its nothing to what i
wanted to do to you gamely retorted
the baron

or nothing compared to what ivan
wanted to do to you remarked kent

  why didnt you let him finish it
in your place i should have done so
provarsk asserted without rancor and
clutching his shattered arm

  because declared kent with quiet
dignity i have punished you enough
you are finished as it is somehow
im sorry youre a game man baron
and-i like them i shall send for a
surgeon

  oh may as well put that off for a
few minutes the chancellor said
wincing with a physical pain that
barely exposed itself in his level voice
may as well tell me the worst
theres not much more to tell
kent said gently only that ive
beaten you past any chance of your
coming back by this time you are not
even the chancellor i think i fancy
von glutz the loyal has come back to
his own and you are broke-broken
like an empty eggshell

drovarsk shut his teeth tried to

	get his arm to a less painful posi-
tion attempted a brave smile and said
i think not the marken mineral
company my dear mr rhodes-

  is worthless i couldnt quite for-
give your trying to bribe my secretary
provarsk that wasnt playing the
game i went after you on that its
a rule of finance to get a man who tries
to bite your leg under the table i got
you the only unprofitable completely
worthless enterprise in marken is the
one in which youve put every dollar
you could get i saw to that i kept
it going at a total loss just for your
benefit youre not worth a copper
centime youll have to borrow money
to buy your railway ticket out-un-
less-unless i relent maybe i shall

there are a lot of things i like about
you there are a lot of placcs where i
can use brave men if they are willing
to be honest and you are at least

brave

  i dont think said the baron biting

his lip to hide his mental and physical
pain that i can accept anything from
you but  will say this-just to show
you that in my way i am fair if i
can ever learn this game you play-
this thing of finance-and i can find
any way to have another go at you ill
do it and-and while im doing it all
the time ill like and admire you
and- he shut his teeth savagely in a
determined effort to subdue the giddi-
ness and weakness that was mastering
him and then with a long sigh fell
sideways and would have fallen to the
floor had not kent leaped forward and
caught him in his anus

  he picked him up as if he were of
no weight and strode across the room
followed by the princess and ivan
whose eyes had roved from lip to lip
seizing the spoken words

  princess eloise the american
called anxiously over his shoulder
please summon some one to help me-
and also a surgeon send them to my
private room and-and he stam-
mered wait for me-here

  her face flushed as if in this tur-
moil she had interpreted some hidden
significance in his words but she ran
across the room and called the sentry
from the corridor and kent heard her
words

  send two men from the guard-room
at once to assist mr kent then go
quickly-as fast as you can-and sum-
mon the court surgeon hurry mr
kent asks you to go quickly

  ivan closed the door dumbly and the
sound of her voice was cut off

  here ivan kents lips moved as
he turned his head toward his follower
from the side of his own bed on which
he had deposited the chancellor help
me to get his clothes off while he is
unconscious you should not have
done this i cant fire you because
after a fashion you and i are pals
but id give a thousand dollars to be
big enough to take it out of your hide
you big ill-tempered chump
the unknown mr kent



  and ivan knowing a lot that was
not embodied in his employers speech
merely grinned and began unlacing the
barons shoes

chapter xv

the princess tiptoed to the
shattered hall door and with
infinite care passed through and
closed it behind her then hesitant
perturbed distressed she looked down
the long reaches lonely as a deserted
avenue as if considering a direction
for flight she paused torn between
the tugging hand of convention and
that of her own inclination conven-
tion urged her that she was of the
blood of proud and lasting kings cer-
tain to find her place upon some potent
throne inevitably destined to rule
but her feeling cried that all was vain
all happiness lost the world barren the
future a desert if now she closed her
ears to the cry of her heart steadily
with clear eyes and clarity of mind she
weighed one route against the other
and then with bent head and tremulous
breath she made her decision she
turned retraced her steps opened the
door very gently stepped inside the
room she bad left and closed the door
behind

  kent grave embarrassed and yet
determined came but a moment later
from his sleeping chamber and closed
the door leading to it-but not with his
habitual directness and decision in-
stead there was about him a curious
attitude of awkwardness appeal and
reverence a strange lack of confidence
for an instant only she forced herself
to meet his eyes they cried their mes-
sage to hers across the silent waiting
room forced by decision to meet this
portentous issue she heard him coming
toward her his voice sounded as if
reaching her from a long distance so
quiet so gentle so grave it was in this
decisive moment of its existence

  you it said are a princess i
am nothing save that which i am-
a man who has done his best but
-what i am-i am

  the voice paused in that time she
stood with hands crossed above -her

breast not daring to lift her eyes to his
-paused as if gathering power to find

the way

  i should not dare to speak it pro-
ceeded more firmly had you not said
what you did awhile ago you said
that you would have given anything
for- he hesitated and spoke scarcely
above a whisper as if a repetition of
her words were profanation you said
that you would have given anything
for my friendship for my esteem
that you had wanted to help me-
always 

lie spoke the last word like one read-
ing die ultimate word of life from
the open book of destiny oh eloise 
he cried with a tenderness beyond all
she had dreamed i am like that poor
foolish juggler of notre dame who
unable to do more than juggle gay balls
upon his hands and feet yet  dared
toss them at the shrine of our lady
and thus gave all he had to give i am
helpless i am nothing in this fight-
the only one from which ive ever
flinched i wanted to go before i gave
myself away but you said-you
said-

  he stopped and she knew that the
poet sotd of him so scrupulously con-
cealed from all the world was bursting
its way released by the alchemy of
love to his last abashed declaration
she waited intent on what he might
say this man who had posed through
all his life as one without sentiment
hard inflexible masterful and who
now for the first time was stripping
bare his spirit

 do you know he said ive
always been ashamed of something that

i	liked-something i read it seemed
too fine to say aloud but its what i
want to say now

i am lie that cries aloud beneath your
      gates

  with eyes uplifted to the moon the
     night your casue walls

  no begger i for paltry dole no sup-
     pliant for paltry favors

  worthless ephemeral and indifferently
      thrown

  i ask all you have all you have been all
      you are 

  ah that you may ever be

  i am that throbbing thing of love

  venturesome calling for its own


the blue book magazine

   there was a childs bashfulness and
simplicity in his declamation nothing
but the quick knowledge that she had
seen him as he was in truth kepi her
from laughing at him and then there
came to her the realization not with-
out a sense of triumph that she knew
beyond all others this strange reticent
retiring man whose very name had been
feared by some of those esteemed as
powerful-that of her alone in all the
world he stood in awe

  if i had known then who-who you
really were she faltered -if i had
not been so terribly disappointed i
should not have said what  did

   she paused but without ever looking
up at him she knew that he recoiled
as from a blow and then bravely
she took the plunge and added in a
voice that was scarcely louder than the
exquisite sound of the winds fingers
playing upon a harp but now that i
know my mistake and that you have
not been defeated i-i have nothing
to retract

che heard him coming slowly toward

   her and lifted her eyes to his grim
rugged homely face and beheld it
transfigured like some weather-scarred
crag suddenly illumined by sunlight
the warmth and majesty of a great
love were there the imperative will to
seize and to shield and the longing to
prove worth by sacrifice

  he would have taken her hand
awkwardly as some poor courtier
might but nothing less than full relin-
quishment was in her heart and so
she lifted her arms swiftly upward
caught his face for a long moment
between her hands looked deeply into
his eyes and then content with what
she saw bent farther toward him and
was caught and held

   forgetful of all else deaf to all else
they had not heard the roaring tumult
that came sweeping toward the palace
increased in the crescendo of proxim-
ity and that now suddenly burst over-
whelmingly upon their ears in terrifying
volume it sounded as if something
hod gone wrong as if revolt had in full
strength rushed upon them

they turned and hastened to the win-
dow the great garden of the palace

had been invaded by a mob of people
the foremost of whom rushed excitedly
to places beneath the windows while
other waves rapidly surged behind
ciosed m and became more dense
until even the walls were mounted by
upthrown crests for a moment it was
difficult to distinguish the character of
that tremendous shouting or to know
whether menace or approval was the
dominant note and then suddenly a
red-faced man who had been crowded
into the basin of a fountain climbed
triumphantly to its top where he stood
silhouetted against the sky waved his
arms and in a stentorian voice that
swept over all else began to sing the
national anthem

  instantly other voices took it up
until to the beating of time by that lone
figure aloft it became united and over-
powering battering the walls the trees
and the skies with stately blows the
lips of the princess eloise quivered
and her eyes filled with tears of emo-
tion kent felt his hands clenching as
lie caught the meaning and knew that
it was an ovation to the king but even
then he could not understand why the
giving of the mines had so stirred the
people his door was jerked open un-
ceremoniously and the king ran in
followed by paulo and von glutz all
appearing scarcely less excited and
jubilant than those below

at sight of his sister and kent the
king waved his sword above his
head and saluted the hilt with his lips

  marken marken he shouted as
gallantly as any of his mailed ances-
tors might have done when announcing
victory after battle

  what have you done demanded
kent once more the cool man of af-
fairs

   ive gone you one better my friend
and acted without anyones advice ive
not only done as you suggested but ive
taken a long step farther ive told
them that without their asking it and
because i have faith in them i surren-
der all arbitrary rights of the crown
and that from this time henceforth
marken is to be a liberal government
in which the people are to exercise their
own judgment and powers and that not
the unknown mr kent



even england herself can boast of
greater freedom and democracy ive
given them their liberty marken is no
longer an autocracy

  he paused proud of the effect he
had produced and saw the great ap-
proval that shone from his sisters eyes
but before he could proceed the
doughty old von glutz took up the tale

  thats not all he didnt tell you
all he roared his majesty ended
by telling them that if they chose they
could even do away with a king and
make marken a republic that was
when they first shouted so loudly and
what they yelled was no no god
save the king god save karl the
great and by the lord almighty
they meant it they stormed the plat-
form they lifted him up and carried
him in their arms old women cried
and knelt at his feet they held their
dirty babies up for him to touch and
then some of the women began to shout
god save the princess eloise and
that started them all off again the
king got himself heard at last and told
them that the credit was not his-that
they owed it all to you kent and then
karl did a fool thing told them that
you two were here and that the palace
grounds were open listen  hear that
the song had ceased and great shouts
were again storming them

  the princess eloise our princess
eloise and kent kent kent
they saw him the man who loathed
publicity quail like a bashful youth and
saw the princess catch his hand and
almost drag him toward the balcony
then he seemed to recall something
that must be done and braced himself
and strode forward he stopped
abruptly just inside the door and
motioned to the king the king smiled
and stepped out followed by the prin-
cess like the abrupt discharge of
heavy guns the noise renewed as kent
followed them and von glutz and
paulo rigid unmoved came behind and
took their posts in the background like
watchdogs of state

lent stepped to the edge of the
balcony and lifted his hand for
silence the same heavy unfaltering
man that had addressed them on one

other occasion when he mentally
derided them and then disappeared
again as then his great voice reached
them like some enormous trumpet but
now there was nothing of cynicism or
demagoguery in his words no jesting
with their ignorance

  his majesty karl second-

  god save karl the great they
corrected him

  -has told you that you owe much
of what has been to-day given you to
me with all respect for his majestys
word i wish to tell you flatly that it
is not so i did nothing you owe it
all to him all i did was to advise
regarding the employment of your in-
dustries i approve of his grant of self-
government for i am an american
but i am as surprised as were you
that he gave so freely

  they interrupted him with cheers
while he stood watching them and evi-
dently waiting to add something more

  you owe me nothing he declared
but to others you owe much you
owe her royal highness the princess
eloise for her advice- again diey
interrupted him with cheers

  you owe to a much misunderstood
man a nobleman steadfast loyal and
true a great payment for his unfalter-
ing devotion to the king to you and to
his duty and to his plain honesty you
are indebted beyond all words i
speak of baron von glutz

  he did not look around in that mad
interim when again they shouted but
had he done so would ha-e seen that
von glutz was for once abashed to
dumbness all that he plain simple
old man had ever asked was to serve
as best he might careless of reward

  beyond this continued the voice
you must not forget the services of
as good a minister of treasury as has
ever conducted the affairs of a people
or a king captain philidor paulo

  in cheering mood they cheered again
and from now on you owe it to
yourselves and your king to those who
have done the best they could for you
to make by continued industry and in-
tegrity the kingdom of marken great
the king has made no mistake you
were not fit to conduct yourselves a
year ago many of you were idie lazy


the blue book magazine

and indifferent it required the inflex-
ibility of an autocrat to arouse you
an autocrat is after all but a nurse
once the necessity for a nurse passes
it passes for all time you are a nation
now known and respected by the whole
world it rests with you whether that
respect shall continue and respect is a
thing that accumulates or diminishes in
just proportion to your deeds it does
not stand still

  the respect given a nation is not
measured by the breadth of its lands or
by what it owns it is measured by the
acts of the individuals who compose it
on each individually rests the good
name of his nation it is by his in-
dividual acts that his country is
estimated i ask you to remember my
words and to consider them when
alone that you may find the right way
in this hour of your assumption of great
responsibilities each to adjust his own
personal life to the demands of a high
standard

the crowd beneath had become
a hushed and thoughtful as he shot
his words out to them they expected
in that grave moment that he would
say more but as if daunted by his own
temerity and unwonted publicity he
abruptly stopped and like one suddenly
frightened turned and fled the man
on the fountain again lifted his hands
and sang with that far-reaching voice
again they joined him with a new fer-
vor containing in its volume some
enormous throb quite without excite-
ment grave in its sincerity

  the king regardless of everything
forgetful of all save the terrific song
vhich for centuries had led his people
to the heights of endeavor there to be
crowned with death or victory shut his
eyes threw his head back and sang
with them with a final outpouring of
fervent wishes the crowd saw him pass
through the door followed last of all
by the white-haired von glutz the
noise died away and the palace gar-
dens began to empty the king
looked around the room for kent he
was not to be seen as if mortified by
his own moralizing he had gone

the

  the door of the room adjoining stood
ajar and the king walked to it looked
in and halted in astonishment kent
was standing alone by the side of his
bed in which lay provarsk the king
hesitated for an instant and then turned
and tiptoed away the broken screen
ought his glance and he paused above
it observing that von glutz and paulo
were both inspecting the same object

  the baron looked around with his
slow eyes and pointed at the tiny dent
in the tiles bordered with splotches of
lead and called attention to it with a
significant smile

  that he said i take to be the last
shot of the last revolt in marken

nce more that day the king saw
 the american it was after twi-
light dusk and a full moon had fol-
lowed one another across the trail of the
skies in the distance where marken
huddled and shouldered on its hills
could be heard mellowed but ex-
pressive the faint sounds of revelry
great rockets marked fiery courses in
the night and then showered upon the
ted roofs their softly floating and
multi-hued rain of stars

  exhausted by his day of excitement
and work the king strolled meditatively
in the garden that had so short a time
before been trampled by the feet of a
people freed he came to a secluded
path on which the moon seemed to peer
intent he stopped short and bent for-
ward unconsciously eavesdropping
those were familiar voices and
familiar shapes those of the princess
walking with the american their arms
outlined in somber black and silken
white around each others waists the
king stepped into the path behind them
and gave a loud ahem

  startled and confused they fell
apart as they faced him there was
but a moments hesitancy and john
rhodes recovering closed the space
between him and the princess eloise
and caught her waiting hand in his

  by your leave sir he said to the
king

  sir said the king the honor is
mine

 my new magazine

investing for profit

   this wonderful magazine is the investors brain
   partner and often referred to as the little
   schoolmaster of the science of investment

dont invest a dollar anywhere until you at
least read investing for profit magazine

every investment lie touches turns into money thin is u common every tlay
expression-no duubt you know it few such men among your acquaintances
these men do not follow blind luck-they have mastered the law of financial
success you may watch them conceive and carry out their financial plana
successfully-and you know they are not mentally stronger than you are but
it is the know how in conjunction with bruins that counts

the education necessary to transform mind conceptions into visual realities is
tlie element necessary to bring wealth to the dreamer until you learn the
real earning power of your money-the difference between rental power and
taming power-the underlying principles of incorporation-the science of
investing-dont invest a dollar in anything anywhere

investing for profit -a liberal financial education

i claim-and i oaji prove it beyond the shadow of a doubt-that my magazine
has not only made thousands of dollars for its readers-but it has saved
them from losing many thousands of dollars in unwise investment until my
magazine investing for profit appeared the small investor never had
an opportunity to ask for and receive honest unbiased sound logical advice
and counsel in the science of investment

think this over what are you worth today iiow much do you expect to be
worth ten years from now and how are you going to build your fortune
if you do not take advantage of the best advice and counsel you can possibly
get on the subject of investing for protit just so surely as there is a law
of gravitation so is there a law of financial success without money you can
accomplish practically nothing-so if you have  or more per month to invest
read my magazine

      why i make this free offer

it is the ambition of my life to give to the great masses of the american
people for the iirut time in their lives comprehensive instruction in th-
science of investment-the knowledge which financiers hide from the
masses-the true inwardness of the great problem of
scientific and profitable investment-placing this infor-
mation before you in facts and figures which you can
easily understand the rich tnan knows the science
of investment-the poor man unwittingly permits him-
self to lack this knowledge this is the mission of my
magazine-it is free to you for six months for the
