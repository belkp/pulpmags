a science fiction department featuring letters from readers

 e are but lately returned from the ham-
 let of brooklyn to which we were be-
 guiled by invitation to observe the unveiling of
 a baby electric brain about to be mass-produced
 for business ff you are one who reads science
 fiction with your tongue occasionally in your
 cheek we heartily wish you had been there for
  what we saw was so much like what you have
 read in stories labeled fiction that it became nec-
 essary to pinch ourself and mutter that this was
 real real real not a story

   elecom  is the name of the little monster
 we saw in action it is the baby brother of such
 giant computers as edvac built for the army
 and eniac built for bell telephone it was
 designed by dr samuel lubkin a cherubic
 modest sort of genius who had a large hand in
 building its big brothers and who showed off
 his baby to the press with a refreshing candor
 about its growing pains

digital computer

   technically speaking elecom  is a digital
 computer it is not a brain in the sense that
 it is capable of real thinking but computation is
 a kind of thought at that and the end results are
 sometimes startlingly similar

   when we arrived the demonstration was well
 under way correspondents male and female
 were perched on folding chairs paying heed to
 dr lubkin who w as explaining with disarming
 informality as much as he could make intelli-
 gible in lay terms a typewriter seemed to be
 busily clattering somewhere we gathered that
 elcom  had just demonstrated its superiority
 over logarithms by solving ten lines from a
 seven-place table faster and more accurately
 than a humanoid-operated slide rule had com-
 puted a weekly payroll in a flash and figured up
 a correspondents income tax for him in exactly
 - seconds for this alone it could have a prom-
 ising future

the machine took the form of an upright

u-shaped panel covered with vacuum tubes in
front of this was a common steel office desk with
a typewriter in a center well the sound seemed
to come from here there was an operator sit-
ting at the typewriter but he didnt seem to be
doing anything yet tile typewriter was obvi-
ously chattering at a great rate

  we got a word in during a lull whos typ-
ing we asked dr lubkin

  the machine he replied as though it were
the most ordinary answer in the world

stranger than fiction

  for ourselves gooseflesh appeared on all areas
of our epidermis and the small hairs on the back
of our neck stood up sure-weve read it a
hundred times weve bought dozens of stories
in which it goes on but this wasnt a story-
we were watching this if you dont think its
different we just hope you get a chance to see it

  we have taught the machine the rules of a
game called nim dr lubkin now announced
would anyone like to play

  a rash reporter would nim is a game of
combinations somewhat like a more complicated
tic-tac-toe it is played with marbles divided
into groups each player being free to take as
many marbles as he likes from one group in
each move the trick is to take the final marble
and to do this you have to leave the correct
number of marbles always behind you

  seven groups of marbles were used the
human was given his choice of making the first
move or letting the machine move first the
reporter who wanted to play elected to go first
and took some marbles from the first group
this information was then typed into the ma-
chine after which the operator sat back lights
flashed all over the board the panel hummed
busily then the typewriter chattered into ac-
tion and again i felt that atavistic primordial
lifting of the hackles as the machine in obvious

operation television

video-technics

  by pat jones

ttnheralded and unpublicized an event
occurred on tv last summer that made his-
tory in the medium listed only on programs as
the proceedings of the american medical as-
sociation it did not capture the imagination or
attention of a very large audicnce sounded too
dry and not at all entertaining yet for the first
time in tv history the general public was ad-
mitted to an operating amphitheatre during the
course of an actual operation

  for eight minutes the tv audience watched dr
fogelson as he operated on a patient suffering
from a duodenal ulcer while the surgeon former
chief of staff of wesley memorial hospital
and associate professor of the medical school of
northwestern university explained in simple
terms for the benefit of his layman audience
precisely what he was doing

  similar presentations have for several years
been telecast over closed circuits for the benefit
of the medical profession alone this marked the
first time however that the interested layman
could be an armchair observer of the skill and
competence displayed by one of the nations fore-
most surgeons

  almost to the last minute some diehards
argued that the- general public was neither
mature nor objective enough to take such
advanced tv fare in its stride it was the more
liberal view that the american public should
become increasingly aware of the tremendous
progress that has been made by american
science in the past fifty years

  at the turn of the century it would have been
considered foolhardy ven to attempt to perform
an operation for a duodenal ulcer and to think
of a cameras eye catching the event and relaying
it to an audience of layman across the country
would have been sheer madness-except per-
haps to an advanced student of science fiction

who knows quite well that todays fiction is
tomorrows fact

  ad schneider special events producer at
nbc tells us that to the participating medical
men it was all part of the routine compli-
mented on his performance the surgeon smiled
indulgendy at the television technicians why
boys he said i just did what you fellows told
me

  the operation lasted for nearly four hours
and the eight minutes which was televised were
fitted into a full hospital schedule no allow-
ances were made for the televising other than
admitting the technicians and their equipment to
the operating room

  there were several unique features on the pro-
gram not the least of which was the way in
which it was introduced across the tv screen
undulated a pip of light accompanied by a reg-
ular ta-thump ta-thumf la-thnnip it was a
pictorial representation of a normal heartbeat
accompanied by the sound of the heart valves as
they functioned

  this was done by adapting to the tv screen a
tape recorder which reproduced the sound of a
normally beating heart and an electron cardio-
scope for visualizing the cardiac sounds as they
are heard at present this device is used to re-
cord cardiac ausculation for teaching purposes
by listening to tape recordings medical students
can learn to recognize immediately every type
of faulty heartbeat a heartbeat recorded on
tape may in the future provide a permanent
record in -a doctors files independent of his
memory and written notes

  we hope youll be watching the next time
scientific history is being made on your tv
screen youll be interested to know that am a
has two such meetings yearly look for the next
one if its on tv youre in for a fascinating
experience

the waiter set down greta mannings des-
sert its something they bring from
freya said her father called dream potion
i believe whatever we think of the intelligence
of those psychs im obliged to admit that they
have elevated cookery to the status of a fine art
good

mmmm said greta allowing the pink con-
coction to caress her palate as she used her
tongue to maneuver into a corner behind her
teeth the capsule she knew she would find in it
too bad you dont eat sweets


	startling stories

   i do not consider it a loss said
 theodore manning serenely he turned
 to the bald-headed man the elec-
 tronic calculator shows that with my
 bodily chemistry there is a high prob-
 ability that i might lose as much as four
 years off my life

   the bald-headed man nodded gamb-
 ling is unscientific he said with the
 air of a man repeating a formula

   greta put one hand on the table i
 think ill go and make myself beautiful
 she said if you dont mind waiting for
 a minute before vve go in for the show
 theodore manning nodded the bald-
 v headed man stood up courteously as
 the girl vanished through the hangings
 in a swirl of soft lights he sat down
 again and said your daughter making
 herself beautiful impresses me as al-
 most as unnecessary a task as proving
 einsteins field theory

   manning nodded both sides of the
 family brought physically eugenic
 lines he said its the temperamental
 number thats dangerously high shes
 a  even though she is a dd as a mat-
 ter of fact thats one of the things i
 wanted to talk to you about before the
 association went into open session i
 think its always advisable to get as
 many of these details settled in advance
 as possible and there are certain points
 in the program we have worked out in
 the terran council that we would be
 unwilling to-expose for public discus-
 sion

   the bald-headed man said you can
 always count on the support of the odin
 delegation for any truly scientific plan
 the immediate relation of this plan
 to scientific advancement may not be
 obvious- began manning and then
 stopped as greta came in again the
 rainbows of her party dress dancing
 around her she had read the message
 in the capsule and rid herself of both
 via the disposal chute

   most perfect of fathers she said
 your imponderable fraction of a daugh-
 ter remembers that she has forgotten to
 tell you about something i have a date

for after the show this evening

  night-spotting said manning
who is it this time

  edgar braun she said looking at
the tablecloth hes found a new one
its only twenty minutes flight and he
says the dancers do rituals from way
back in the twentieth century they
come from some place called bali where
the japanese were an imperial people
imagine

  manning had a slight frown isnt
this the third or fourth time youve been
going somewhere with this young man 
he said emotional involvements are
unscientific

  oh pooh she reached over gaily
and patted his cheek im as emotional-
ly involved with him as i am with the
secretary he just knows a lot of queer
places and we have a good time it isnt
anything like an acquaintance

  the baldjheaded man who had been
glancing from one to the other said
edgar braun thats a rather common
name on odin where i come from is
he from there by any chance

greta flashed him a glance i think
he was originally but he came here
to take his phd in vulcanology at ha-
waii because you have so few volcanoes
on odin

  the bald-headed man toyed with his
spoon and dropped it as the waiter be-
gan to collect the debris of the dinner
most of the brauns tend to be moder-
ates theres a psych streak somewhere
in the line ive been told

  greta laughed you neednt worry
about edgar if there was a psych
streak in his line be must have come
to terra to get rid of environmental in-
fluences that could develop it hes a
perfectly good dd ive seen his card
after all my parent taught me that
she glanced demurely at manning in
fact his full number is dd-- well
in the first place anyone with a  tem-
peramental rating couldnt possibly be
a psych personality no matter how deep-
ly the tendency might be embedded in
the long view	

his genes and- she flashed a glance
at her father-do you really think i
could be interested emotionally in a 
ten points below me in intelligence
hed try to repeat jokes on me to make
sure i understood in fact he does
theodore manning emitted a sigh and
reached under the edge of the table to
insert his thumb in the register which
would automatically charge the presi-
dent of the association for the advance-
ment of science with the price of the
dinners no i suppose not he said
even the psychs tell us that women

apologize to them then saw the bald-
headed man watching her with frown-
ing concentration and sailed past to the
place in the middle thrusting her thumb
into the socket

  the stellania reached its last won-
derful chords there was a breathless
pause the screen disappeared and they
were looking into the depths of a stage
that seemed to run back into infinity a
blue light lay at one corner a yellow one
at the other no matter how often greta
had seen it there was always a thrill in
the opening of the eternal contest and

-----------jjianqs tlsw isjohld---------

take a silicone world with siliconc life    silicone life why not
life doesnt necessarily have to have our own cirhon-oxygen metabo-
lism-there are many chemical combinations possible but given a silicone
world with silicone animals and plants fletcher pratt has constructed a
tale in which the science is authentic and consistent and never out of
character with the story if you want an inside look at how thus was
done read the authors own notes on the planet uller which you will
find elsewhere in this issue

  the long view along with two companion pieces on the silicone
planet is already scheduled for book publication later in the year aside
from its interest as a scientific exercise it also happens to be a gripping
and sophisticated story which we found quite enthralling we dont
have to invite you to let us know how you like it you will

                                        -the editor

have a greater capacity for impersonal
associative pleasure than men what is
the ancient word-gold-excavating-
or something like that i think i hear
the stellania shall we go in 

  the bald-headed man stood aside for
greta to take the second pace as man-
ning with the assurance of a man who
is bored by merely petty courtesies and
whose position has entitled him to too
many of them led the way from the din-
ing-stall down the corridor the yellow
lightnings of his physicists evening
dress flashing around him

  the amusement room was already
full but as manning strode down the
aisle a couple of techs next to a vacant
seat scrambled out apologetically to take
places farther back greta started to

she gripped the base of the finger-con-
trols more firmly as out of the blue
depth-swam a planet attended by twin
moons another swam into view on the
yellow side from the lightings on them
it was evident that they were satellites
of different stars a tiny dot that would
be a space-ship arced from the blue
planet to one of its moons the music
took a rapid beat to indicate times and
distances

  greta watching in frowning concen-
tration as she made her calculations felt
the bald-headed man relax beside her
with a little chuckle he said im glad
im here as a visitor and dont feel ob-
ligated to play counting the primary
of that bue planet that makes it a prob-
lem of four bodies they dont make it
	startling stories

that complicated for us on odin

  she flashed him a glance there are
a lot of techs and low-number scientists
in for the association meeting sssh

i	want to think

on the yellow planet there was a
pinpoint of light the indication to
those familiar with the game that it
possessed atomic explosives and an-
other space-ship dot soared away from
it hunted vaguely through the space be-
tween and then returned to the surface
the bald-headed man said theyre
giving you plenty to work with space
travel on both of them

  from one of the moons of the blue
planet a spaceship dot rose jerkily
damn said greta her fingers flying
i was afraid someone would start too
soon there hasnt been time to estab-
lish the rotational relations there
the space-ship swept around in a
graceful curve to the blue planets other
moon and the girl watched intently as
the bald-headed man said dont you
often find yourself overruled by a ma-
jority i find it frustrating

  not very often said greta eyes
still on the stage this machine is set
to accept the nearest accurate calcula-
tion and the majority only controls
when its a question of calculations of
the same order of accuracy im pretty
good at math so i get away with quite
a lot  

  she broke off suddenly as two space-
ships left the yellow planet in a long
curve then somebody playing on the
yellow side is good look at that theyre
orbiting around each other and getting
maximum mutual course correction
she pressed keys the music gave a
skirl and two three four space ships
left the blue planet for its outer moon
curving in sharply good girl if you
did it chuckled the bald-headed man
that will give greater distance ca-
pacity and better angle of approach
greta didnt answer her lips a little
parted she had become utterly absorbed
in the great game as miniature space-

ship after space-ship left the two planets
and maneuvered toward each other in a
maze more intricate than three-dimen-
sional chess someone who had chosen
to play on the blue side made a mistake
two of the space-ships collided and
dropped back toward the planet as she
said damn again and we havent
an unlimited number of those but
then someone on the other side blun-
dered too and one of its ships shot off
at a long tangent to the very limit of
the theatre from which there came a
flash to announce it was lost

  in the central space the opposing
fleets were marshalling the yellows
moving the more rapidly but also more
raggedly not seeming to have quite the
precision gretas accurate calculations
were giving their opponents they ap-
proached each other there were little
flashes here and there and the minia-
ture space-ships began to disappear as
hits were scored the losses were not
all on one side but the blues with their
compact formation and better maneuv-
ering were clearly gaining gaining
suddenly the yellow fleet split apart
was decimated in full retreat a mur-
mur rose from the audience as the pur-
suing blues swept them away-all but
one which almost unnoticed slipped
past the outskirts of the blue fleet toward
its home planet

  it closed in suddenly there was the
flicker of light that meant a super-nu-
clear bomb the whole planet began to
burn and abruptly the curtain was
closed and the lights in the amusement
room came on

  greta her face downcast turned to-
ward her father he was sitting with
his hands still on the controls a smile
that might be triumph on his counte-
nance

  oh said the girl you did that
it wasnt fair

  the phrase is unscientific and tinged
with emotionalism saicttheodore man-
ning  fair is a term from the old
civil courts i believe relating to the
period before it became possible to

the key on the phone to the out make
record position adjusted the panel be-
side his chair to show the face of any-
one at the door without showing his
own and sat down

  do you care for tobacco he said
or a spray of some kind in the room
no thanks said the bald-headed
man without neglecting the amenities
were a little more austere on odin than
the home planet and t never acquired
either habit

  pity said manning taking out a
cigar and lighting it you miss a good
deal he drew in a coupleof reflective
puffs and then as a matter of fact
im rather glad my daughter isnt here
a small smile was visible at the cor-
ner of the bald-headed mans mouth i
have been wondering when the exalted
president of the association for the
advancement of science would get
around to explaining why he invited a
minor delegate from odin to dinner
sarcasm does not become you said
manning nor does false modesty as
a matter of fact here on terra we call
the odin scientists who are disposed to
cooperate with our more advanced ele-
ments the lauria group and leave it at
that

   i see said lauria and waited

  i suppose you have considered means
of dealing with the psychs yourself
the bald-headed mans impassiveness
suddenly deserted him weve con-
sidered it to the point of over-produc-
tion of adrenalin he cried but what
can we do we not only have them to
fight but the damned moderates we
tried to get the marriage rejection reg-
ulation repealed on odin just for that
one planet and do you think we could
do it ill be damned if we could mod-
erates he spat the word and they
call themselves scientists

   i am glad you feel so strongly about
it said manning the more advanced
scientists here on terra have long since
reached the conclusion that the only way
to break up this connection between the
moderates and those confounded witch-
doctors the psychs is to eliminate the
latter from the association entirely
wouldnt the psychs appeal to the
political authorities

  manning smiled that might have
some weight on a few of the outer
planets where the environment is still
incompletely subdued magni for ex-
ample or even to a lesser degree your
own i can assure you that on terra or
venus or thor the political authorities
are only a kind of game for people of
low i qs-techs or artists or servs
we merely go before them and present a
scientifically established fact and they
make the necessary changes in the reg-
ulations

   all right then lauria patted him-
self on the top of his naked skull the
political authorities wont interfere if
you succeed in eliminating the psychs
from the association as unscientific
but how do you propose to accomplish
that they have votes in the associa-
tion and so do the damned moderates
did it ever occur to you how the
votes of the psychs are cast in the
parent association

  no what difference does it make
it makes a good deal as it happens
the psychs are inordinately proud of
always being a unit on every question
they consider this agreement one of the
proofs of the fact as they call it that
psychology is really a science

  yes i have heard something about
that said lauria in fact they took
away the license to practice of one on
odin because he couldnt agree with the
others on a diagnosis

jltanning said you wander into
reminiscence which is unscientific
therefore when any question comes up
for decision the vote of the psychs is
cast as a unit-and it is cast by the no
	startling stories

 psych the one with the highest in-
telligence rating

  who is at present old henrik kool
said lauria as stubborn a man as i
know about do you suggest that the
next man in line might be more amen-
able and that kool is not immortal

  i suggest nothing of the kind the
resort to violence is barbarous and all
our advanced group would be the first
to condemn it moreover the next man
in line is walter trevenna i believe
and we ohould gain nothing by sub-
stituting him for kool no we have
developed a far better and more subtle
plan

  go ahead

  what would you say if i told you that
i know of a psych with an  intel-
ligence rating

  laurias eyes opened wide i would
first say that you were perpetrating a
joke and then if convinced you are seri-
ous that im surprised he hasnt al-
ready been made no  psych why
youre only a  yourself

  manning smiled again its no joke
and its perfectly extraordinary that a
man with one of the lowest intelligence
figures ever reached should be a psych
or perhaps i shouldnt call him a man
yet hes not even thirty years old and
hasnt been declared adult the name is
lajos harkavy-i believe hungarian
by ancestry-and his full rating is
bc-- quite aside from the fact that
his temperamental figure is so high that
he couldnt be anything but a psych
hes interested in painting he gave a
note of utter contempt to the last word
and stopped but as lauria continued to
look at him without saying anything
went on

  well our proposal is simply to have
him declared adult

  now lauria frowned i dont see
he began and then let me ask two
questions how would having a man
with that degree of intelligence at the
head of the psych interest help our posi-
tion and how do you expect the as-
sociation to declare so young a man

adult is that why you want my help

  manning said thats three ques-
tions and not two as a matter of scien-
tific accuracy ill take up the first one
first lajos harkavy has received gen-
eral scientific and special psychological
training but as i was just remarking
he seems to have a temperamental feel-
ing for the arts that is if he were
head of the psychs one of two things
could be expected either any unified
action on their part would be paralyzed
by internal conflicts among them or he
would remain perfectly indifferent to
what happened to the general body as
a matter of fact i believe it would not
be too difficult to get him to go to freya
where the atmosphere would take care
of it that he enjoyed himself harmlessly
without ever bothering us again and
as he has a good  years expectation
of life yet that would guarantee us a
free hand for this length of time i
think it is not beyond possibility that
we could get the regulations altered in a
satisfactory manner even eject the
psychs altogether from the associa-
tion

t auria nodded your line of rea-
-i soning is convincing he said and
i withdraw my third question ill be
glad to help in any way i can but the
other one is still more serious how do
you propose to have him declared
adult

  there is one case in which any mem-
ber of the association can be declared
adult and admitted to full participation
provided he has a low-number intelli-
gence rating that is-when he mar-
ries

  i see so you propose to set up an
acquaintance looking toward marriage
for this harkavy did you have anyone
special in mind

  manning laid down his cigar i have
my daughter greta manning

  lauria made a sound which could not
be interpreted in words

  divorce your mind from emotional-
ism said manning and consider the
the long view



matter rationally in the first place the
psychs will hardly object to the idea of
their future leader marrying my daugh-
ter the objections if any would come
from our advanced group and it is
precisely for this reason that i asked
you to drop in tonight-to tell you that
the idea has my entire approval in the
second place their intelligence numbers
are within three points of each other
which makes it a eugenically desirable
permanent union

  but- began lauria

  manning raised a hand in science
we must learn to reject merely emotion-
al appeals that is the thing that dis-
tinguishes us from the psychs i am
quite aware that she is my daughter
and i have the normal paternal feelings
toward her however as we were re-
marking earlier her temperamental
number is dangerously low and i have
reason to believe that she has been con-
tacting some of the moderates perhaps
is involved with them we managed to
get a spy ray on toijiru shigemitsu
and it reported she had met him at least
once

  you overwhelm any objections i can
make before i think of them said
lauria but i still have one more how
do you know the acquaintance will result
in a marriage that is may not this
harkavy already have an emotional in-
volvement

  it doesnt matter people with any-
where near as low an intelligence num-
ber as his are excessively rare and if
either she or harkavy should reject the
acquaintance they might be forced to
take it up again at the age of compul-
sory marriage as for any emotional
involvement harkavy has at present it
may be dismissed his intelligence rat-
ing is so high that he could not conceiv-
ably be allowed to marry any such per-
son for that matter i dont think he
has much opportunity where he is hes
out on uller

  thats one of the aberrant planets
isnt it silicone chemistry as i remem-
ber and just barely habitable

  thats right why anyone should
want to go there i cant imagine but
he seems to consider it a good place to
practice his art

  lauria said very well you can
count on my support when the matter
of the acquaintance comes up before
the eugenic committee i presume you
yourself will have to offer objections
simply for the sake of appearances

ill

a

      ill ready for a big evening
said edgar braun lightly as the serv
closed the door of the flyer behind them

  mmm-hm said greta im glad
you picked an evening suit with brown
radiations it will go nicely with my
rainbows

  i keep telling you were tempera-
mentally made for each other he said
throwing in the switch if youll only
let me apply for an acquaintance-
the little machine soared ducked
lightly to the left in response to the
warning signal indicating an incoming
rocket express and steadied toward the
north

  have you ever thought of the po-
tentialities of model numbers asked
greta

  oh listen gree-

  you listen ive told you a dozen
times that i refuse even to think about
marriage or getting emotionally in-
volved until this thing is decided one
way or another besides if we lose
there wont be any chance for emotion
the advanced group is getting awfully
close to putting through that regulation
about not being able to refuse any mar-
riage recommended by the eugenic
committee fathers stopped talking
about it and that means hes aboul
ready to act wheres the meeting going
to be held tonight

  at a casino on the shore of lake
george paul found a spy ray planted
in the rodman place as a matter of
fact  his voice trailed off
	startling stories

  as a matter of fact what
nothing youll find out when you
see toijiru

  it was dark inside the flyer as the
silver ribbon of the hudson grew small
beneath the moon and a montreal-new
york carrier flashed above them in the
opposite direction its port-lights gleam-
ing like a string of fireflies edgar
braun swung the flyer expertly into the
long slant take a look back will you 
he said just to check on whether we
have a tail

  greta swung the basket-seat around
and craned her neck not unless hes
beneath us she said who else is com-
ing tonight

  just toijiru and paul frasser its
a special something came up all right
close down im going in

  the flyer slid down the slope bounced
once on the surface of the lake in a
cloud of spray and rounded to the pier
where a serv hooked it in and swung
back the door as they climbed out the
lights from the casino windows caught
gretas dress and once more turned it
to a garment of rainbows while the
soft beat of music came from within

  this is a queer place to hold a meet-
ing sajd greta are you sure that the
spray and the drinks wont affect our
thinking

  toijiru thought of that there are
some little summerhouses on the hill at
the back and after you and i hav had
a dance or two were to go out there
and meet them i have the directions
the outer door slid back as he placed
his hands in the black-light ray and they
were in the corridor being greeted by
a bowing superior serv who bowed still
more deeply at the full unit braun slid
into his hand and led the way to the
inner door

a fine wave of spray met them with
a pulse-tingling effect at the door
a dance had just ended and exotically-
clad couples were laughing and talking
as they made their way back to the
tables as the serv led them to one

braun said i dont suppose you have
any idea of what your father is plan-
ning for the association meeting
sssh said greta you never can
tell who might overhear then as they
sat down not precisely only its go-
ing to be something pretty tricky he
had dinner with the head delegate from
odin tonight and yesterday it was one
from venus and they both belong to
the advanced group already

  i dont see how- said braun and
paused to give an order to the waiter
then completed his remark -how
that makes any difference

  dont you theyd vote for anything
he proposed he must be getting them
ready to vote for something he doesnt
propose

  i wouldnt have thought of that

  i know ed thats one of the rea-
sons i wont accept an acquaintance
with you

  the orchestra swung into a smooth
rhythm that had its origin on one of the
outer planets and edgar braun his
face a little stricken stood up and of-
fered her his hand the spray as usual
was intensifying his emotions as she
pillowed her head against his shoulder
greta said just this one its a long
dance and i think we can slip out when
it ends come on play up and pretend
youre deliriously happy with me

  he swung her through the movement
of the dance then they paused for a
moment making a pretense of consulta-
tion before he led her toward the exit
at the back there were gravel paths
beyond the outer door here winding
up the slope among the trees with
muted lights set close to the ground to
prevent stumbling put your arm
around me commanded greta as they
passed a turn-off that led to one of the
summer-houses we have to make it
look good even if we dont feel that
way

  but i do said braun thats just
the trouble heres the one i think

  he swung her round the curve past a
screen of bushes and up to the summer-
house a light flashed dazzlingly in
their faces then shut off abruptly and
paul frassers voice said its all right
were here

  the little kiosk was intended for only
two people and the four of them had to
squeeze close into the seat somebody
touched the transparent weather-shield-
ing into position and toijiru shigem-

itsus voice said out of the dark this
is a very special meeting particularly
for you greta theyre getting ready
to move

   know that already said the girl

  you dont know all of it your father
is going to have an order of acquaint-
ance put through the eugenic commit-
tee for you
	startling stories

  there was a momentary silence then
greta said low and hard i wont ac-
cept ill reject the acquaintance even
before it starts 

  you had better hear the rest of it
said shigemitsu he isnt going to offer
it himself in fact i wouldnt be sur-
prised if he pretended to object the
acquaintance is one he could object to-
lajos harkavy whos going to be leader
of the psychs as soon as he is declared
adult

  they couldnt see her mouth work in
the dark but it was a minute or two
before she answered ive heard of him
isnt he-

  shigemitsu said he has one of the
best intelligence numbers ever recorded
lower even than yours the eugenics
committee will put on every bit of pres-
sure it can to bring the acquaintance to
a marriage

tn the dark someone who must have
been edgar braun touched and
squeezed the girls hand as shigemitsu
paused and then went on the trouble
is that harkavys temperamental rat-
ing is bad-

  i thought that one of the reasons i
was working with you people was to do
away with all that

  let me go on i use the word bad
only in the sense that the advanced
group use it harkavy has psych train-
ing but he appears to be more inter-
ested in painting and pauls contacts
say that hes pretty lazy just about the
type the advanced group would want to
use as a stooge with him at the head
of the psychs they might be able to get
through any number of new regulations
-even the one theyve been trying for
to make all marriages compulsory
paul frassers deep voice added
they might even make their own group
into a kind of sacred priesthood with-
out the psych vote were outnumbered
badly in the association

  greta said theyre a priesthood al-
ready a grinding priesthood that has
already wiped out nearly every bit of

personal liberty in the worlds why

think if-

  shigemitsu said yes but we havent
much time

  all right then said greta the
practical question what do you want
me to do

  accept the acquaintance we havent
any grounds for protesting it now be-
fore the eugenic committee or in the
association and we dont understand
whats going on perhaps your father
suspects you of working with the mo-
derates or perhaps its only that he
wants to bring the psychs to his sup-
port somehow find out what this har-
kavy chap is like and what he intends
to do find out what his connection with
your fathers group is plant a spy-ray
on him if you can

  greta shivered a little in the dark al-
though it was very warm with the four
of them in the restricted summer-house
you remember what we were talking
about what if my fathers group suc-
ceeds in getting through the regulation
making marriages compulsory after an
acquaintance has been accepted and
im stuck for the rest of my life with
this-this-

  shigemitsu said quietly i have two
sons one of them had scientific status
and went to venus he didnt like what
was happening in the swamp-mines
there and he couldnt get anyone in-
terested so he tried to organize some
of the servs themselves in protest they
tried him for trying to elevate civil
authority over scientific reduced him to
a tech and sent him to freya hes still
there oh quite happy when we hear
from him-breathing in that freya
atmosphere and unable to do his own
thinking he will probably live another
hundred years but we count him as al-
ready dead

  greta shivered again and rustled up-
right all right i see what you mean
only its a little hard to take a chance
on mortgaging your whole life just to
find out something that ought to be easy
to find out anyway
the long view

  braun held the door open for her
then followed her out onto the path the
sound of footsteps came from some-
where up the slope and she said -
lovely but i do want one more drink be-
fore we go home

  youre entitled to one more at least
he said aloud then under his breath and
with hi head close to hers gree
theres one way you can get out of this
acquaintance and not have anyone ob-
ject you can take up a non-marriage
connection with me will you

  no edgar she put a hand on his
arm i wouldnt be in this at all if i
didnt believe that everyone should be
allowed to live his own life without
scientists or anyone else telling them
what to do to do what you suggest
would be choosing compulsion to avoid
another

  behind them in the dark paul frasser
said to shigemitsu she is very young
one might almost think that she really
considered emotional decisions as hav-
ing value are you not afraid that this
harkavy will convert her fully to the
psych position it would be a pity to
lose our best spy in the advanced
group

  i dont think you need to be con-
cerned said shigemitsu if we lose
our spy in the advanced group we gain
one with the psychs she can hardly
refuse to continue working with us in
view of what we could make known of
her past activities a charge of betrayal
of trust is quite as serious as one of
inciting social unrest to the advantage
of the civil authorities

iv

when the annunciator sounded
greta was deep in the diophantine
analysis of a second-order riemann
equation she sighed put down her cal-
culator shot the results thus far at-
tained into a recorder and pressed the
button the face that looked from the
box was that of a stranger young thin
and straight with lines of humor

showing around the mouth

  miss manning it said

  yes

  i am lajos harkavy may i see you
for a few minutes

  why-i thought you were on uller

  i was thats one of the things i
want to see you about

  her face became ever so slightly
frigid  dont know-

  surely you can spare me a few min-
utes-under the circumstances ill even
promise to be entertaining

  all right its the  button nd
story

  she frowned as she switched the con-
nection off touched the inter-room com-
municator and made sure her father
wasnt home and almost as a reflex
gesture checked her eye-shadow before
the entrance-wall slid back he was
taller than she expected and wearing
an inflatable as though he had just come
from a space-liner

  wont you come in she said in-
dicating a chair

  thank you he waited for her to sit
down before taking his own place and it
occurred to her that was exactly what
an irrational psych would do expecting
her to be impressed by the antique
minor courtesy i understand we have
been named for an acquaintance he
said

  the eugenics committee passed it
this morning how did you find out so
quickly

  lajos harkavy smiled not very
difficult even out on our little paradise
on uller there are copies of the priority
lists and it wasnt hard to guess that
with our respective ratings theyd at
least make a try at bringing us together
what i want you to do is reject the
acquaintance

  greta felt a totally irrational anger
at being asked to do what she had her-
self intended to do indeed she said
may i ask why you dont reject it your-
self

  you may and ill answer that its
for reasons personal to me which wont
	startling stories

seem logical to you as an advanced
scientist but it will have to do for the
moment i want to present you with the
reasons why you should reject in your
own interest

   and what are they

   he looked around the room i notice
you havent any room-spray on and not
a single picture in the place you
wouldnt like the way i live i like
sprays i like fun-and i paint pic-
tures this last was uttered with subtle
overtones of defiance

   that might turn out to be the basis
of an incompatibility making a rejection
of marriage necessary after the ac-
quaintance period it isnt one for re-
jecting the acquaintance

   he grinned all right youre an ad-
vanced scientist and im what you
would call a psych with a poor tempera-
ment rating i find pure mathematics
or pure science of any kind an unholy
bore what could we say to each other
or do together during an acquaint-
ance

   greta said thats what you said
before only youre putting it in other
words its an ingenious device in dial-
ectics but youll have to do better and
besides my own temperament rating is
 i could just as easily be a moderate
youre making assumptions

tie grinned sardonically and
youre trying to change the ground
of the discussion im onto that one
lets see-why else should you refuse
the acquaintance for one thing im
living on uller at least until i finish
the series of paintings im working on
you wouldnt like it there

   you dont have to tell me i looked it
up when this acquaintance warrant
came through the weather is terrible
the water tastes like soap and has to
be distilled the animals are foul and
you have to use an artificial day-night
routine that only answers your last
objection there would be plenty we
could do together mostly on the adven-
ture side

  what ambition said lajos and
stretched his legs lazily and what an
ambition but dont think youll get me
into anything like that i prefer air-
conditioned rooms with a slight spray
in them and the only adventure im in-
terested in is the kind that concerns-
females

  and yet you want one to refuse an
acquaintance im still waitihg to hear
why i should

  for answer lajos got up and paced
slowly across the floor then back again
then he came over to gretas chair and
in a new voice quite low said is there
any chance of a spy-ray around this
place

  i dont think so but-

   no i dont dare risk it but believe
me theres a very good reason not
connected with myself at all-

  greta stood up now youve made
me curious i suppose that being a psych
you deliberately applied the stimuli to
bring it about but you succeeded
theres a park just across the river on
the old palisades lets go look at na-
ture

  he didnt say anything more as she
dialled for the duty serv to bring the
runabout to the terrace or when they
got in and soared away across the
stream and she was well enough aware
of the possibility of a spy-ray being
planted in the machine not to say any-
thing either

  the park was bright and green in the
fresh spring air greta parked the run-
about at the entrance and they strolled
down a walk between a double row of
monstrous blue lilies from one of the
outer planets to a bench

  greta seated herself and said now
will you tell me about it

  he frowned all right i will its
just this if you follow me to uller on
an acquaintance thores a good chance
you may never be able to get back
why not

  your father hasnt told you about
the shortages and the reason why the
production committee has been moved
the long view



to venus didnt he tell you

she shook her head not a word
its a pretty carefully guarded
secret but the essence of it is that
theres a major shortage of beryllium
and its system-wide

  for moderators in power plants and
ship drives why cant they use the old-
style carbon moderators they still do
in some places

  on planets you forget that when
you use a carbon moderator in the dou-
ble reaction for interstellar drive its
so inefficient that it doubles the con-
sumption of fissionables the system has
enough uranium to hike along for quite
a while yet on normal consumption
rates what with the discovery of an
occasional new planet that can be
worked for uranium but if you double
everything up well soon be in the posi-
tion they were here oh terra when the
oil reserves began to run out

greta said that is things slowing
up everywhere and revolutions and-

  not quite as bad as that there are
plenty of power sources and plenty of
uranium to keep the planets running
individually and even for interplanet-
ary travel where there are two habit-
able planets in the same system and
they only use the primary reaction
drive but interstellar travel is going
to go right out the window and soon
that is unless something happens
so thats why- began greta and
flushed

  why what said lajos

  i was just going to say that must be
the reason for that regulation last year
-the one restricting interstellar travel
to people with scientific status and re-
quiring an authorization from a local
board

  i daresay thats part of it but it
seemed to me that you were going to
say something else

  you psychs are too clever by forty
per cent the girls voice had an edge

	startling stories

to it thank you for the information-
and for your solicitude about my wel-
fare now ill give you a piece of in-
formation too i never had any atten-
tion of accepting an acquaintance with
you and i wouldnt accept one with a
man who paints even if he had an in-
telligence rating of point one does that
answer your question

to her surprise harkavy merely
rose from the bench and stood
frowning he was very tall she ob-
served no he said it doesnt not
at all i dont understand why a mem-
ber of the advanced group who would
be left in control of practically every-
thing if interstellar travel were cut off
and could sit in their comers doing
mathematical puzzles all day while
everyone else worked for them should
develop so much heat over the prospect

  you dont have to- she began but
before she could say any more two
figures in the decent blue uniforms of
regulator techs turned the corner of
the path and came straight toward
them one of them stepped up to the
young man

  you are lajos harkavy he said

  yes

  please come with us the charge is
making an unauthorized interstellar
voyage contrary to regulations

  greta clutched the arm of one of the
regulators what are you going to do
to him

  the man shrugged its a major re-
gulation probably theyll deport to
freya as temperamentally unstable
thats the usual line

   but you cant do that

   im not doing it said the regulator
if youve got a song and dance give
it to the rating committee

   greta said you cant do it and ill
tell you why we both have scientific
status and this is the first day of an
accepted acquaintance i think the order
of the eugenics committee takes pre-
cedence over any violation of regula-
tions except acts of violence and i

dont want to go to freya

  it sure does lady said the regula-
tor stepping back and turning to his
companion get your phone out and
check that will you morgan

cjlreta stood looking out the win-
dow toward where the depressing land-
scape of uller stretched under brown
rubbery grasses to the shore of the

was coming in from the cape holland

his arms to keep warm as he waited
for the craft to slide in to the gate of
the processing plant where he could
hook in the automatic draw

  the girl said the spy-ray was a
mistake he waited until he said good-
night then handed me the disc and said
by the way heres your plaything i
like to keep a certain amount of priv-
acy i suppose i had it coming

  paul frasser did not stir from his
seat a man with his intelligence is
hard to handle but im beginning to
wonder if the whole operation wasnt a
mistake from what i can make out
theres nothing in him we can use all
hes interested in is painting and night-
spots 

  outside the sun rim met the horizon
redly and the day wind that had ruffled
the surface of the sea to long undulant
swells was falling greta turned the
edges of her hair redly outlined by the
light

  theres something-almost mysteri-
ous in him she said and after all he
did find out about the beryllium short-
age

  frasser grunted that could have
happened in a number of ways after
all hes going to be titular leader of the
psychs some day maybe someone in
your fathers group thought it would be
a good idea to let him know what does
he say about it by the way

that its a problem for applied
the long view	

scientists and he isnt interested
thats what i told you gree people
who put a wall of mystery around them-
selves generally havent much behind it
except a desire to amuse themselves and
i will say that harkavy is devoting
himself to that with all the resources of
his high-power intelligence calling him
mysterious is just a relic of the pre-
scientific age whats mysterious about
him

  well-he wont even sleep at my
quarters

  is that surprising probably has
someone coming to his it wouldnt be
the first time it had happened on uller
better break the acquaintance we have
work to do

  the sun was half way below the hori-
zon now and the lights were beginning
to stream automatically from walls and
ceiling in compensation greta manning
shook her head

  no paul the job of trying to make
it a world a universe where everyone
gets a square deal whether they have a
high eugenic number or not means
everything in the world to me you
know that thats why i accepted this
acquaintance in the first place when i
didnt want to a bit but ive accepted
it now and given my word and so has
lajos and i wont pull out and i wont
cheat either

  frasser snorted emotionalism un-
scientific-

  isnt it just to give everybody a
chance at unscientific emotionalism that
were doing what we are paul to keep
people from being bred like animals for
the production of more pure scientists
there are alreadly too many

  frasser said that sounds odd com-
ing from-oh well lets not quarrel
were in this together and up to our
necks

  yes arent we though she was
cheerful again in a second what time
is it ive got to go i promised malya
bryussov id come over and look at the
new method of calculating high primes
she thinks shes found but i dont be-

lieve its anything more than lucas and
a calculating machine

rphe air-lock at the door hissed slight-
 ly as she ran out frasser sat in
frowning silence for a moment then got
up and put on his heated garments no
matter how long he stayed on uller he
could not find himself comfortable at a
temperature of  c his quarters were
on nd street which meant he had only
a brief walk past the buildings of fused
sandstone built squat and monolithic
to withstand the hurricane winds of
uller before reaching the square with
its pylon-like beam tower in the center
and the communications center on the
other side

  work had just closed down for the
day and in the hall inside people were
tapping their communication-boxes for
letters and the reels of the days news
frasser nodded to one or two pretended
not to notice a superior tech who was
coming toward him and would either
want a promotion or the endorsement
of an authorization for an interstellar
flight and went down the broad stair-
case that led to the long-range com-
munications room

  i want a tight-beam communication
to terra he said to the clerk behind
the desk to toijiru shigemitsu dd-
- new yoik terra

  the clerk started to punch in the
numbers then looked up pardon me
sir but are you a scientist theres a
new reg-

  what the hell would i be asking for
an interstellar tight beam for if i
wasnt demanded frasser he fished
in a pocket produced the metal identi-
fier flung it on the counter and vicious-
ly punched his thumb down on the
checking machine whats your name
and number you deserve a report for
disrespect

the clerks lip trembled slightly
ector mariscal sir rb-- im
sorry sir but i hadnt seen you before
all right said frasser ill drop
it when will you have the beam set up
	startling stories

  i dont know sir theyre having a
little trouble at station no -a gonflar
got in and damaged the tower-and
terra may be on that side but ill put
an urgent on it do you want me to call
you at your quarters or will you take
it here

  might as well wait i havent any-
thing else to do

  will you take the fourth compart-
ment sir you know where the reels
are

   frasser nodded initialed the five-unit
chit the clerk shoved at him and pushed
down the hall to the compartment
marked  where it occurred to him to
have any incoming calls at his quarters
transferred to the center a light spray
would do him good he decided so he
turned one on and then settled himself
to contemplate the reels of the days
news there was a picture of the gonflar
being driven from station  one after
another of its six legs developing an odd
hurrying motion as the stimulus-whip
was applied to that section by armored
guards a mentally unstable tech who
had murdered his wife was telling his
tale to a psych and then a woman with
a long face began to explain how much
she would do if elected-and frasser
turned the machine off

from the speaker in the wall a voice
said abruptly your connection
sir and shigemitsus voice followed
slightly blurred by crossing light years
of space toijiru shigemitsu here

  watakushi-wa uta-wo kiki-tai said
frasser

  sora wa urnai came the answer i
think we may omit the remainder of the
challenge and response my friend i
recognize your voice why do you call
shes getting balky resisted the
suggestion that she break off the ac-
quaintance before it ran its full term
shigemitsu said have you con-
sidered that he may have decided that
it would be useful to turn the connection
into a marriage and is applying his
knowledge of psychology to her

  bah i its just those romantic ideas
we noticed before she left she talks
about having given her word and that
sort of thing

  you dont think shes really at-
tracted to him

  only to the biological function ex-
tent otherwise hes about as useless a
piece of furniture as ive ever seen
still it might be useful to have him
at the head of the psychs and her in our
interest

  hes going to refuse the appoint-
ment and turn artist at least thats
what she thinks and shes too valuable
a piece of property for our side to be
wasted like that

  i see shigemitsu was silent for two
ticks then the other matter

  you mean rizzi  dont think we
can bring him over i talked to him for
a couple of hours he agreed that there
was a strong possibility that niflheim
was extremely rich in beryllium just
as you deduced from the registers also
that there would be a big promotion
waiting for anyone who could find a
way to get at it through that fluorine
atmosphere but in the first place he
didnt think it could be done and in the
second he didnt seem interested
waqts things to go on the way they are
after all hes an  which would make
him pretty close to no one man out
here if all interstellar travel were cut
off hes an applied scientist sure but
there arent more than two or three
pures on the planet

  did you try putting the girl on
him

  yes and ran into more romantic
ideas she said that she wouldnt cheat
while conducting an acquaintance with
harkavy

  my friend said shigemitsu you
are insufficiently subtle it is a quality
of race which has nothing to do with
intelligence i think i perceive the an-
swer to our problem you are keeping a
careful check on harkavys move-
ments 

   as close as i can the spy-ray failed
the long view	z

he found it where she planted it and
gave her back the disc so i had to go
back to primitive methods and have him
personally followed so far the reports
have been devoid of interest

cven over the long-range beam
--j frasser could hear the slight hiss-
ing sound with which shigemitsu habit-
ually began one of his trap-questions
what do the reports concern he
asked

   matters like this subject spent the
afternoon in a glassine hut on cape
lion painting a view of the matteran
sea subject spent the evening having
dinner with his acquaintance took her
to her quarters after a session in the
game-room and then spent a good part
of the night at the cave of the four
winds night-club in the company of a
lady who calls herself roselle la
blanche and who makes a profession of
exhibiting her torso-

  one moment

 yes said frasser	

   you have the key to the situation in
your hands how often do these night-
club visits take place 

  frequently

  and you have just told me that the
girl will not as you put it cheat while
conducting an acquaintance with hark-
avy does it not occur to you that she
would take an unreasonably romantic-
ized attitude toward his connection with
this ecdysiast

  i never thought of such a thing
begin thinking of it shigemitsu
was crisp you are dealing with a per-
son who lacks the normal scientific ob-
jectivity a temperamental  arrange
to take her to this night-club when the
two of them are there together you will
not need to apply any other pressures

vi

her voice apologetic greta said
im sorry i couldnt make it last night
but i was working on a new postulated
geometry that turned out to be per-

fectly logical at speeds in excess of n
prime the beauty of it is that its per-
fectly useless there arent any speeds
in excess of n prime

  frasser gazed at her a moment i
sometimes wonder if that isnt the trou-
ble he said you people in the pure
sciences have precedence over everyone
else but the only time youre happy is
when your work is useless and now the
machine is running down are you go-
ing to wear that

  greta glanced down at her costume
which was being touched to multi-
colored flames as it caught the lights
from walls and ceiling my rainbow
dress why not its a party

  its unusual for the guests to wear
luminant clothes in the place were go-
ing its a little on the rough side and
theyre apt to be taken for-well pro-
fessionals

  oh she considered i dont sup-
pose it would hurt me to be proposi-
tioned but youre probably right wait
a minute she disappeared into the
back and presently returned in a dress
which while still definitely for the eve-
ning gave off only soft tones of green
paul frasser tried the communication
box found it locked and was gazing at
the ceiling when she came back i have
the flier on the roof he said it didnt
seem worth while bringing it in for the
time id wait for you

   he stepped ahead of her to the eleva-
tor where is this place she asked
as they emerged on the shadowy roof
shivering slightly at the impact of the
chill uller night

  way out past the cape most of the
habitues come from the tide-control
project techs and servs and a fairly
hard gang at that

  the flier took off smoothly bucked
once and straightened out on course
far below and to the right there was a
blaze of brilliance around new raven-
nas interstellar port and conveying
machines were waddling clumsily up to
deposit their burdens in the huge bulk
of an interstellar freighter
startling stories

  theyre pushing it hard on liquid
silicones from the fisheries remarked
frasser trying to stock-pe lubricants
against the date when there wont be
any interstellar travel

  greta shuddered slightly beside him
but whats going to happen to all those
people she asked the tchs and
servs who have been brought in here to
do the work on the promise of more
money and quick home leaves
theyll have to stay  uller thats
all but i think sympathy for them is
wasted theyre not first-class minds
and the resources of this place are suffi-
cient to provide everything they really
need what gets me down is that your
fathers precious advanced group is
quite ready to put applied scientists in
the same category getting the warning
about the beryllium shortage is one
thing we can thank-you for

  have you been in touch with
shigemitsu asked the girl is he go-
ing to do anything in the association
council 

  i doubt if hell try to do anything
immediately if he would make the in-
formation about the shortage public it
would not only stir up the techs and
servs but the applied scientists would
be charged with the responsibility for
not having foreseen and provided
against the shortage and as a result
our moderate group would be just about
blown apart

  if we could only   began greta
then theres the cape

  i have it on the screen button up
were going in he worked controls
below them the contours of the form-
less black mass of the night club build-
ing were picked out by infra-red in the
moonless night of uller in answer to his
landing beam and as the flier slid in
servs hooded against the cold came run-
ning out to guide it to the ramp of the
underground hangar

  the door cut off the stars behind
paul frasser handed greta out ac-
cepted the offered check and steered her
toward the elevator where a bored serv

slowly returned to his pocket a reel and
the eye-piece through which he had been
contemplating it

rfhe first thing of which greta be-
came conscious when they reached
the level of the club itself was a quantity
of spray in the air that almost made her
head swim the next was that the place
was circular and in accordance with its
name was decorated to resemble some
huge rock-hewn cave back in terra
there was no dancing at the moment
the decorative scheme had been carried
into the permanent music which was
that of winds howling through an
aeolian harp the lights were dim she
had reached their table before she could
see enough of her surroundings to make
out that paul frasser had not exag-
gerated about the character of the place
most of those present were clearly techs
and servs some still in their working
garments accompanied by shrill-voiced
girls to whom the low level of the light-
ing was a charity

  frasser ordered drinks and looked
around well what do you think of
low life he asked some of the danc-
ing is really remarkable though

  the spray was having its effect she
felt a thrill of adventure tingle up and
down her spine do they have fights

  if they do theyre stopped pretty
quickly do you see those two techs at
that third table theyre regulators
hello theres derek hyde he half
stood and waved to a man sitting alone
at a table across the room who got up
and sauntered over bringing his drink

  there were introductions derek
hyde accepted an invitation to join the
couple and it was explained to him that
miss manning had come for the danc-
ing

  good idea said hyde itsbetter
in a place like this than in the regular
establishments more emotional and un-
restrained they have one girl here who
would be wonderful anywhere in the
system her names roselle la blanche
and i think she comes from venus how
the long view -	

she drifted here i havent any idea just
about due too

  the music became one of the quick
double-steps from the inner planets and
couples covered the floor greta said
where do the women come from
most of them are servs from new
ravenna said frasser- they have to
have an ostensible profession you
know

  the music stopped but instead of
taking up its windy background rhythm
again swung into a quicker pace that
changed and rose to a pitch of the most
intense emotion then suddenly all the
lights went out to flash back on as ab-
ruptly showing a girl standing alone in
the center of the floor

  thats her now said derek hyde
there was no doubt that she was
somebody and fully conscious of it as
she caught up the beat and with a slow
seductive movement began to weave
through a figure the strings of opals in
which she seemed to be entirely clothed

picking up the light from floor wall
ceiling in a thousand shifting patterns
one of the opal-chains came loose and
slithered across the floor as she moved
then another and another as the men in
the audience began to shout and stamp
until finally in a sudden whirl of mo-
tion she lost the last chain of opals just
as the helmet of dark hair broke from
her head to cover her nearly to the knees
and the lights were extinguished for a
second time

  you were right said gret that
was wonderful

  so is she said paul frasser i
wouldnt mind knowing her myself in
fact-

  derek hyde turned toward him its
no use old man shes already got a
connection-with that high number
psych out here you know the crazy
one thats turning down his scientific
rating to be an artist harkvaly or

as the emotion-intensifying spray
touched her it set gretas fingers to
gripping the table so hard they hurt
in a quick intense voice she said do
you meanlajos harkavy

  yesthats the one why

  frasser said miss manning is here
on acquaintance with him

  oh look here said hyde im
sorry i didnt mean-

  paul said greta get the superior
serv i want to talk to her at once i
dont care what it costs use my rank
i want to talk to her i have to talk to
her

  around them the music had risen
again and couples were dancing as
frasser beckoned for the serv gretas
hand went out in an impulsive gesture
and tipped over her drink but it sank at
once into the absorbent table

  derek hyde said again im really
sorry-

  it doesnt matter said the girl
please go away

  paul frasser said really greta i
had no idea-

   it doesnt matter  tell you i want
to talk to her

  roselle la blanche came down be-
tween the tables behind the superior
serv her hair had been hastily gath-
ered up and she had thrown something
around her the techs whistled at her as
she passed and one or two of them tried
to pinch her

  the superior serv said this is miss
manning shes a high-ranking pure
scientist and wanted to talk to you
roselle la blanche slid into the pfoce
vacated by derek hyde to me she
said why certainly honey though i
dont know what about i dont know
about anything that would be good for a
pure scientist she giggled a little

  greta said about just one thing do
you have a connection with lajos
harkavy

  the beautiful slightly vapid face of
the dancer hardened i dont know
that its any of your business

  tell me

   youre being emotional honey they
 always told me that people with scien-
 tific rating were rational i was going
 to ask you for a unit and a half for
 bringing me out here but ill give it to
 you for free you oughta take a treat-
 ment she stood up flashed a come-on
 smile at frasser and was gone

   for a minute greta didnt say any-
 thing then with both hands on the
 table she said paul have you a mes-
 sage going soon

   yes its technical

   make it partly personal tell edgar
  braun im coming back to him as soon
 as the next ship leaves and take me
 back to my quarters

   at the elevator he checked suddenly
 dammit he said wait for me i for-
 got to leave anything for the serv

   but it was not the serv he hurried
 back into the club to speak to it was
 derek hyde and he said here you
 did a wonderful job it worked out just
 right

 utll go with you because i prom-

   	ised said greta but you might
 as well know now that im going to re-
 fuse the marriage her voice was flat

   lajos harkavy stopped tightening the
 strap on his portable easel any par-
 ticular reason he asked

   she felt herself flushing and half-
 turned her head no just the general
 one that we dont seem temperamentally
 suited to each other

   i would have said quite the opposite
 in fact you make me wonder frankly
 whether some ulterior factor has not
 developed that-

   oh you and your psychology she
 stamped her foot and then suddenly
 flashed into a smile theres no use
 quarrelling about it though now lets
 have as good a time as we can out of
 whats left where are we going

   to a place about eight hundred miles
 north of here-macmurray forest
 ever hear of it

   didnt some of your pictures come
 from there
the long view	

  he slung the easel and box of paints
on his back yes but not at this time
of year the colors are really spectac-
ular when the leaves begin to come out
and i want to try to catch them with
luminescents that will give the effect of
changing light got the food package 

  he pushed the button for the wall
slide then clicked the communicator
harkavy will you send my flier up
and drop a report on wind conditions at
seventeen degrees north macmurray
forest area on the seat

  the sun was just coming up to the
southeast as they stepped out of the
elevator head onto the wind-blown roof
and the sky was streaked from south to
north with long fingers of dun-colored
cloud red along their lower edges greta
glanced at them and said could you
catch something like that with your
luminescents 

  he shook his head i could probably
but its too opaque to produce an emo-
tional reaction that would only be rep-
resentational painting

  but how do you go about it if you
want to tell the people who look at your
pictures something about the feeling we
get up here on the roof at dawn with
hardly a flier in sight and the loneli-
ness and this gloomy city below we
could be the last people on uller-or the
first oh i wish-

  he glanced at her sharply what
  nothing here comes the flier

  the plate in the roof slid back and the
flier appeared on its elevator looking
rather like a pious insect with its vane-
cases folded over its back lajos
climbed in took the food package and
painting equipment and snapped them
into a locker then said button in
tight im going to give her a rocket
shot unless you think you want to look
at the scenery below

  no thank you the scenery on this
planet doesnt impress me in fact i
could do without it for the rest of my
life

  he fingered the controls and opened
the key to the rocket fuel line is that

why youve decided not to go through
with the marriage

  no i- oh stop trying to fish
around in my mind

ttis only answer was to step on the
-- power button and greta was jerked
sharply into the buffers as the flier
slanted upward with air screaming
around it the rocket cut out and the
pressure eased as they began to tilt
downward harkavy set the vane-open-
ers to automatic and said youre right
about the painting its up to the artist
to convey every type of emotion-to
find means to make absolutely anyone
experience what he felt at the time
the only trouble is that i wouldnt know
how to go about making a given member
of the advanced group experience any
emotion whatever

  im a member of the advanced
group

  only by heredity and with a low
temperament rating one of the diffi-
culties of our so-called civilization is
that the capacity for emotion has been
practically bred out of the upper scien-
tific levels in the interest of obtaining
eugenic qualities that will give greater
intelligence and if the advanced group
succeeds in putting through the regula-
tion making it impossible to refuse a
marriage ordered by the eugenic com-
mittee it will be worse than ever

  i hadnt thought of it that way
said greta but it did seem to me that
the regulation would be-unjust

  there was a clicking as the helicopter
vanes took over harkavy peered down-
ward to get his bearings took the wheel
and said a desire for justice in fact
even the concept of justice is a purely
emotional matter itself unscientific
dont you remember studying about
some of the archaic political states on
earth where the elected non-scientific
authorities could declare certain things
were true or not even prohibit scientific
research along some lines

  greta said i should think that feel-
ing the way you do youd try to do
	startling stories

something about it the new marriage
regulation  mean after all your in-
telligence number is low enough to make
you a policy-maker

  harkavy shrugged association pol-
itics doesnt interest me evolution will
take care of the matter in time al-
though if its controlled as sharply as
the advanced group wishes man is cer-
tainly going to evolve into two sub-
species one species with all the intel-
ligence and no emotion and the other
absolutely the reverse in fact i think
were some distance along that x-oad
now

  youre a fatalist she leaned over
to look at the incredible sight of an ul-
lerian forest swimming up toward them
with its curious wilted-looking thin-
trunked trees just breaking into the
tenderest of green leaves at the tips of
their branches the sunlight touching
the spicules of quartz in their trunks to
a thousand changing colors while here
and there a dead tree stood like a single
milky jewel

  the flier sank smoothly toward a
cleared area in a valley between two
hills did a slight upward slant and came
to rest on the slope lets eat our
breakfast inside said greta i dont
mind glassine but youll need all the
space in the hut for your painting
things

  all right whats the menu 

  i have no idea the hostel put it up
i just told them i wanted two meals for
two people one of them a hungry man

  she produced the three cans marked
for breakfast turned the-heating keys
and began to lay disposable dishes on
the table harkavy detached from the
wall

  continuing our former conversa-
tion said harkavy what both the
pure and applied scientists have lost
sight of is that the original purpose of
science was to serve mankind as a
whole they look down on us psychs and
barely allow us the name of scientists
but its something we cant forget be-
cause people are our raw material

  oh i dont think the moderates have
forgotten it said greta they just
dont want all their researchers under
the control of the advanced group and
for their interests here try some of
this it smells delicious meat of some
kind by the way there arent any ani-
mals around here are there

  not likely to be said harkavy
that is not dangerous ones although
there might be a few little cone-cats
around the gonflar country is down
toward the sea and you dont usually
find burex unless there are gonflars foi
them to prey on

tvthen they finished the meal hark-
 avy decided that the view from the
opposite hill was better and got out his
equipment to walk over greta accom-
panied him to the hilltop but after he
had set up his glassine hut and begun
to work he began answering her re-
marks with a series of grunts so she
went outside to wander among the trees
and look at the mosses that crawled
over the ground under them in patterns
as intricate as snowflakes

  she could see quite a distance between
the thin trunks so there wasnt any dan-
ger of getting lost but she herself hard-
ly realized how far she had gone until
she heard a shout muted by distance and
turned to see harkavy waving her fran-
tically toward him as she ran toward
him she became aware of a muffled roar-
ing sound in the distance like the sea
beating on a beach and abruptly she
was running into an increasing gusty
rush of wind a fallen opalescent log
caught her foot and down she went
with a sharp shard from one of the bro-
ken branches penetrating her cold-suit
and cutting her knee but she was up
again in a minute and running out of
the corner of her eye she caught a flick-
er of something white and then she was
beside harkavy

  too late he said pointing the
whole area between them and the hill
where the flier stood was filled with toss-
ing waves and beyond it toward the
the long view	

south a white crest was rushing while
the continually rising wind tore at them
what is it she asked

  the spring bore its my fault i
forgot about it i even forgot this was
the right area for it

  whats the spring bore

  you havent been here long enough
to learn about all the niceties of our
climate you know the poles freeze in
winter big ice-caps melt almost as large
as those on earth when they begin to
melt in the spring the rivers start run-
ning toward the central seas but at first
its only a trickle here and there be-
cause ice-jams form at theinsource-
points then one day the water pressure
behind gets to be too much for the ice-
jam and she goes out like that

  will it last long can we get back to
the flier

  cant tell how long may have to
stay here over night maybe not lets
get the hut braced though the winds
that follow these bores are usually some-
thing

  he worked more rapidly than she
would have imagined picking up frag-
ments of the quartz tree limbs and
stacking them around the base of the in-
visible glassine hut greta limped after
him until he stopped her with youd
better get inside and sit on my chair
moving around isnt doing that cut on
your knee any good and the first aid
kits over in the flier here wait-

  he ran rapidly down to the shor-e of
the roaring torrent and returned with a
piece of ice here put this on it that
will stop the bleeding

  isnt it silicious asked greta

  not enough to worry about spring
ice is pretty clear you can even drink
the water from it

  greta said ouch at the touch of the
ice then do you know i was thinking
about your luminescent colors and the
effect of changing light in math we
have a series of equations known as the
weierstrass analystics a development
of hamiltons work in optics i think a
formula could be worked out on that

basis which would give you perfectly
predictable results even with lumines-
cent colors

  harkavy frowned i thought you
pure mathematicians were disinterested
in practical zesults he said then it
isnt just a matter of predictable results
in a physical sense we know pretty
much what were getting that way even
with luminescents its the resulting
emotional reaction that concerns us as
painters thats where the whole quar-
rel with the advanced group lies they
arent prepared to admit as a science
anything that doesnt give a predictable
result

  elementary school observation mr
harkavy i know i was clearing
the ground but im convinced that
there is a real science of psychology and
the only way we can reach it is by way
of the arts by producing emotions
through artistic means and then check-
ing on how we got what we did

  she looked past him out through the
glassine wall to where the arms of the
rubbery trees were whipping in the
wind i almost wish-lajos whats
that

a long the direction of her pointing
finger among the trunks a crea-
ture like a biologists nightmare was
shuffling toward them its reptilian head
low as it sniffed the ground and its
three pairs of squat legs moving in un-
even undulations

  burax said harkavy i said there
wouldnt be any this far north well i
was wrong he must have smelled the
blood where you cut yourself theyve
developed a taste for mammalian blood
that makes them a little more dangerous
than a flock of tigers

  he was working at the side of his -
painting-case which dropped open to
reveal a white object about a foot and a
half long surmounted by a tube which
ended in a transparent conical noozle

  what- began greta as the burax
appearing to catch sight of them for the
first time lumbered forward in a clumsy
	startling stories

charge harkavy snapped a gap in the
glassine and as the creature closed in
a jet of something white sprang from it
straight into the reptilian face and long
jaws the jet seemed to go right in
greta saw that where it struck there
was a bubbling that seemed to come
from the very interior of the animals
head its two middle legs clawed for-
ward as the front legs doubled up and
it lay twisting and heaving outside the
hut

  what did you do to it asked greta
contemplating that silent agony

  gave it a dose of pure hydrofluoric
acid theyre just about indestructible
to anything else im afraid were going
to be chilly in here though he pointed
to where the drip from the nozzle of the
gun had cut a long series of slashes in
the glassine wall through which the
chill was flowing into the hut

liater talking to frasser greta
explained -and in the morning he
waded over and brought back the flyer
and here i am she finished chemis-
try isnt my branch so i dont know
quite how peculiar it is but i do know it
isnt usual

  its so damned unusual that i cant
think of a good explanation offhand
said frasser but it does hook up with
a couple of other things

  what sort of things 

  frasser frowned and his rather pop
eyes opened a trifle wider look here
he said how real is this painting of
his

  greta sipped from her glass very
real ive seen some of his pictures at
the studio and  saw him begin on one
while we were on the trip and theyre
good not that im an art critic but as
he explained to me hes working on the
conveyance of emotion by means of pic-
tures and i think hes getting some-
where i dont know any better way of
telling it than saying that when the light
shifts in one of them you seem to feel

something more than that-

  you talk like a psych-or a low-level
tech however thats not the point
there isnt any chance then that the
painting is a cover for some other form
of activity

  it could be after all- she gave a
little hard bark of a laugh-i havent
been with him too many of his waking
hours and comparatively few of his
sleeping ones he could be running half
a dozen things on the side like that
dancer but why all the questions
the night before you left marius
rizzi went to harkavys studio and
spent practically the entire night there
in connection with your story i think
this makes it practically certain that
theyre up to some scientific activity to-
gether and the only research projects
rizzi has registered with the tjller
council are in connection with carbon-
nitrogen-silicone chain molecules noth-
ing at all about hydrofluoric acid
then the project isnt authorized
whatever it is cant you bring charges
before the council 

  paul frasser made a mouth and
take the chance that its all strictly on
the level and id run into a false accusa-
tion charge no thanks marius rizzi
is a physical chemist and an  id have
to know a lot more about what i was
charging him with before i tackled a
customer like that but lets figure this
out youve been in harkavys quarters
whats the layout and is there space
enough to house a laboratory of any
kind

  greta closed her eyes in an effort oi
memory its down-one of the under-
ground quarters when you come off the
elevator youre in a rather small square
room that he uses for a reception room
on the left toward the back is the door
of his studio so she traced an im-
aginary plan with her finger the
studio runs all the way back its a big
oblong room next to it right behind
the reception room is the dining-room
and running the length of both of them
to the right of the reception room as you
the long view	

come in is a long bedroom and living
room with shifting partitions and one
of those antique fireplaces

  no doors or sliding panels that
might lead to more rooms

  not off the reception room it has
doors in three walls and the elevator
panel or the dining room either that
has three doors and the food delivery
tube and i dont think the studio it
would have to be pretty well concealed
and i cant imagine why hed want to
conceal it that carefully there might
be an entrance to another quarters
through the bathroom or one of the
closets off the bedroom i never thought
of looking

  frasser said  think you better had
we want to be sure

  but ive broken the acquaintance
and given notice

  i know but this is so important we
cant afford to overlook a thing ill tell
you how it can be arranged ill have
someone watch the place and notify you
when he goes out so you can slip in
theres every chance in the world that
the door-lock is still tuned to your voice
and even if it isnt and you have to get
the building officer to let you in there
wouldnt be anything queer about your
going to the quarters of an acquaint-
ance thats why youre the only one
who can do it without arousing suspi-
cion-his or anyones

iret a shuddered a little i hate to
 think of how id explain myself if
he came back and found me there why
is it so important to find out whether he
has a laboratory

  merely because of what youve just
been telling me about some kind of gun
that projects high-speed jets of hydro-
fluoric acid do you realize what that
means

  no what

  taken in conjunction with the meet-
ing with rizzi it probably means that
our young artist our time-waster is go-
ing to have a try at niflheim for beryl-
lium and that hes close to the solution

of the major problem do you see

  work it out for me paul i told you
chemistry wasnt my branch

  the trouble with niflheim is staying
alive the atmosphere has a certain per-
centage of free fluorine enough to kill
you quick mixed up with a weird collec-
tion of the gaseous fluorides of practi-
cally all the non-metals in existence its
been sampled that looks all right to
start with because you can build a pro-
tective suit like a space suit out of metal
and after the free fluorine has attacked
the outer surface and formed a thin
coating of fluoride nothing more hap-
pens just the way aluminum reacts with
water-vapor in the air to a small extent
but there are rains on niflheim and they
consist mostly of hydrofluoric acid
which isnt very good for a protective
suit even when its made of the vang
metal they use in rocket-tubes the
joints arent very safe and one little
crack could play hell with the man in-
side the suit

  besides theres the little problem of
seeing your way around we just dont
know of any glass or transparent plastic
that would last more than a couple of
hours in niflheims atmosphere a man
would be quite blind there even if he
were safe otherwise the only way to
be certain would be to build out of some-
thing that already has so much fluorine
in it that it cant take on any more like
teflon

  whats teflon

  for answer frasser got up and went
to the spool cabinet extracted a spool
and put it into the speaker hubbards
list of elementary chemical compounds
it announced and ejected the index
strip on which frasser made his selec-
tion the machine clicked and gurked
teflon it said a plastic composed of
very long chains of linked cf units
hardness  tough white to grayish
in color translucent in very thin sheets
can be extruded and pressed into shapes
at temperatures around  degrees
easily machined requiring no lubrica-
tion during the process subject to cold
	startling stories

 flow under continuous high pressure as
 the carbon-fluorine bond is extremely
 strong remains absolutely inert chemi-
 cally at normal temperatures and can-
 not be stuck to anything whatever
 known since the twentieth century

 frasser switched the machine off
 there you are he said but notice
  that the man said translucent in very
 thin sheets while you said the nozzle of
 harkavys gun was transparent sure
 about that

   i certainly am it looked as though
 the liquid came from inside the thing
 and some kind of pressure were applied
 to it inside the nozzle and from another
 source

   could be good mechanical arrange-
 ment they probably made it as a test
 piece to see whether their material
 would stand up without leaking under
 service conditions but i dont think
 theres much doubt that theyve suc-
 ceeded in producing a transparent form
 of teflon and they probably have an-
 other opaque form with greater hard-
 ness that working parts can be made of
 thats rizzis doing damn him

   greta stirred in her seat theres
 something  dont understand she said
 why are he and lajos keeping it so
 secret if theyre really going to niflheim
 and have the means it would be of im-
 mense benefit to the whole of humanity
 if they could get at the beryllium any
 council even the central one ought to
 be glad to authorize it

   paul frassers smile was more like a
 snarl if you dont know the answer to
 that one youre more emotionally ro-
 mantic than i thought for one thing
 your fathers little playmates arent too
 anxious to have beryllium found if in-
 terstellar travel stops theyll stay right
 where they are on most worlds sitting
 on top of the heap for another thing
 if rizzi and harkavy pull it off by them-
 selves theyll gain so much credit and so
 many votes right in the association
 that they can practically write their
 own ticket we wont even be able to

hold the moderates in line and with a
psych running tilings we might as well
go back to the old days when political
officers controlled even scientists

  i see

  so the first thing is to find out where
theyre making the stuff get the formula
if possible keep them from using it be-
fore we can take some action its too
bad you broke the acquaintance now
you might have been able to make him
talk

  greta said we all make mistakes
dont we and stood up ill stay in my
quarters to hear from you about lajos
being out make it as soon as you can
i have my special travel permit and
want to be on my way back to earth

  oh that reminds me said frasser
your adored parent seems to have be-
come somewhat excited about your
breaking off the acquaintance with har-
kavy while you were out on your little
jaunt among the burax we got word that
roger ingelhide is on his way here

  greta stopped thats queer he
usually only does political errands for
father like rounding up support for a
new regulation or getting somebody dis-
enrolled as a scientist

ix

the perpetual violent wind of uller
drove the rain in little hard level pel leu
that stung right through the transpar-
ent face-hood of gretas raincoat as sr
climbed from the ground car pressed
the lever that would send it into the
automatic garage and let herself into
the weather-hall of the building where
lajos harkavy had his quarters

  an old sen was guiding a cleaning
machine down the hall he smiled and
lifted a hand in recognition and greta
wished she hadnt been seen but there
was nothing she could do about it now
she felt her heart beating rapidly and
decided that this was what it must have
felt like to be one of those persons who
took other peoples property-she
couldnt remember the word for them-
the long view	

back in the archaic ages before science
took control and the eugenics com-
mittees bred anti-social behavior prac-
tically out of existence

  the elevator slid smoothly downward
greta stepped across the narrow hall
approached the sonic plate and pro-
nounced the phrases that would give it
the combinations of sound that under
the subtle analysis of the device would
be as much her own as her finger-prints
this is greta manning one two
three five six why piebald gentian
frasser had been right the door slid
back and the lights in lajos reception
room came on

  he hadnt changed anything but she
had hardly expected him to she turned
into the bed and living room touched
the reception room lights to silence and
stood for a moment looking around in
the dimmer radiance that flowed from
walls and ceiling at her entrance right
ahead lajos had moved one of the par-
titions around the corner where the bed
was probably to use spray while he
slept there couldnt be any door in that
corner to her left another partition
with an open swinging door in it per-
mitted a glimpse of the fireplace he
had changed things there too making
that part of the room into more of an
intimate corner for reading and when
greta went through the door she saw
that a projector was hung on the parti-
tion

  the fireplace itself might just might
conceal a panel leading to another
apartment if lajos were clever enough
to have covered up his scientific activity
so well he was clever enough to have
thought of that she stepped to it
touched the light to greater brilliance
and began examining the intricate carv-
ing of the mantelpiece for any detail
that might indicate a door-button

  with the greatest clarity the speaker
in the wall pronounced this is lajos
harkavy one two three five six why
piebald gentian

  greta had just time to put the lights
out with a panicky jab of her finger

when the light in the reception room
came up at the entry of someone and
lajos voice said come in i think i
can guarantee- he stopped

  another voice somewhat heavier said
beg pardon 

  lajos said be comfortable and take
off your cold-suit i was saying that i
had wired this place with detectors so
that you need not worry about spy-rays
privacy on uller is expensive we have
so little outdoor life will you have a
spray or a drink or tobacco

  greta crouched and crept toward the
back of the room where at a pinch she
might slip through into the dining
room blessing the softness of the sili-
coid floor

  the heavy voice said i do not myself
indulge but i would not find it disturb-
ing if you wish to do so

  lajos said you pure scientists sel-
dom do what can i do for you

  in the dark greta tripped on some-
thing and almost fell but saved herself
with the arm of a big chair

she heard the heavy voice say mr
harkavy i want you to judge the im-
portance with which my mission is re-
garded by the fact that even with the
extremely restricted amount of inter-
stellar travel available i was alloted a
reaction car for the sole purpose of com-
ing out here to see you

  i am honored mr ingelhide
greta could imagine the slightly mali-
cious gleam in lajos eyes as he said
this you could always reach me on a
closed beam circuit

  this is not a matter that could be
discussed in that way let us put it that
it is a matter of negotiation

  there was a momentary silence in
which each seemed to be waiting for the
other to say something evidently lajos
won for it was the heavy voice of ingel-
hide that spoke first i am here as the
persona representative of the president
of the association for the advancement
of science

  i am more than honored
	startling stories

  his daughter has just given up her
acquaintance with you

  yes she decided we were not tem-
peramentally suited for marriage with
each other

  ingelhides voice was heavy with dis-
approval in our group i am afraid we
cannot recognize the existence of tem-
peramental difficulties as scientific but
i will not labor the point the heart of
the matter is that a certain situation has
resulted

  you mean the beryllium shortage
you know a good deal dont you mr
harkavy that is one aspect of it yes
a certain group calling themselves the
moderates chiefly composed of applied
scientists are trying to make use of the
difficulties caused by this shortage to
make themselves dominant in the asso-
ciation that is throughout civilization
everywhere we believe they intend to
degrade both the pure scientists and the
psychologists to the level of techs i
need not point out to you how dangerous
this would be for you personally and
for civilization as a whole

  go on

   the test case will be the proposal for
a new marriage regulation making all
marriages proposed by the eugenics
committee compulsory the moderates
propose to defeat the regulation as this
will constitute a vote of no-confidence in
the present council a new one would

have to be elected dominated by the
moderates and they would then proceed
with the rest of their program

  greta could hear lajos give a little
laugh very ingenious arent they
but i dont see why you should come out
here to tell me about this i have no
vote im not even an adult officially

  that is what i came here for the
president of the association authorizes
me to say that it would be possible to
pass a special regulation conferring
adulthood on a man of your intelligence
rating the psychs would hardly oppose
it and with the help of the advanced
group there would only be a certain
number of moderates in opposition

  i see said lajos provided i came
out for the new marriage regulation aft-
erward

  ingelhides voice was smooth nat-
urally we would be cooperating you
would automatically have a seat on the
council it might even be possible to
have you given the rating of a pure
scientist

  i am more flattered than ever

  as for the young lady in question if
it met with your approval once the new
marriage regulation was passed one of
the first acts of the eugenics committee
would be to pronounce a marriage be-
tween you and her eugenically desir-
able

  you havent overlooked a thing have

the adventures of

it smells grand

aroma sweet as any rose -

it packs right

packs to please you-
gooones knows
the long view	

you greta held her breath until she
almost strangled waiting for what was
coming next it did not come at once
there was the click as the doorpanel to
the studio slid back the muffled sound of
lajos footsteps and then his voice
mr ingelhide does this picture
mean anything to you

  it appears to be a representation of
two people standing on a cliff at twi-
light why theyre moving and the
twilights getting darker

  thats the effect of luminescents
the painting hasnt anything else to say
to you 

   ingelhides voice was slightly puzzled
it is very skilfully rendered he said
tentatively

greta heard lajos sigh thank you
for the compliment i came out here
to uller to paint it because this is the
only world that would provide me with
the necessary effects and it is supposed
to convey the terror of a failing and fall-
ing world in which two people have no
resource against the dark but each
other either i have failed to make this
clear or you have not understood it it
doesnt matter but surely you can see
that you have as little understanding of
the emotions that actuate me as i have
of the calculations that actuate you the
answer to your proposal is no and no
again

  ingelhides voice took on a dangerous
edge we may be forced to make other
arrangements-

  i have no doubt you will try now
listen to me you think you are offering
me the keys of the universe bah i
already have greater prospects than any
you can dream of and i shall not be in-
debted for their fulfillment to a group
which intends to fasten a tyrannical
stasis on mankind in the name of sci-
ence good-bye mr ingelhide i wish
you a pleasant journey back to earth
if you feel that way about it-

  i do good-bye

  there was the click of the elevator
door-panel greta heard lajos feet go
pad pad then she was suddenly bathed
in light and his voice said you can
come out now

  her face flaming but as boldly as pos-
sible she walked through into the recep-
tion room i suppose you knew it was
me and not just anyone

  of course as i told that rather
crude gentleman who brought your fa-
thers message i have detectors on the
place the little box just over the door
to the dining room which you probably
never noticed reported that the lighta
had been on since you are the only
other parson for whom the door has
been tuned-i must have that looked
after by the way-it was obvious that

	startling stories

you had come to the place while i was
out and were still here  thought some-
thing like that might happen when i
found i was being followed on going out
thats why i hurried back

  greta said coolly im surprised you
didnt haul me out for ingelhides bene-
fit

  oh that would never do you see i
mow youre spying for the moderates
md id rather have you let them know
exactly where i stand than turn you in
to your fathers group hed be likely
to banish you to one of the less pleasant
planets has in emotion in his makeup
you know

  very chivalrous of you said greta
trying to make the remark sarcastic
what makes you think im spying for
the moderates

  lajos put his fingertips together
first you tried to plant a spy-ray on
me thats comprehensible in a girl
who wants to know something about the
man she is probably going to marry but
suspicious second the same ship that
brings you to uller also brings paul
frasser an agent of the moderates and
although you have no contact with him
on board you visit his quarters after
you arrive third you break off the ac-
quaintance for no assignable reason and
at a most pecular time fourth when
we went on the trip to macmurray for-
est you defended the moderates against
the advanced group fifth you slip into
my quarters while im out to look for
something did you find it by the way
are you sure youre perfectly right
on all those points mr harkavy no i
didnt find it may i go now

  as you wish he touched the button
for the doorpanel

  as she stepped through she turned
good-bye lajos harkavy theres one
thing about me though at least i dont
cheat

  she saw his mouth gape in amaze-
ment behind the closing panel

the clerk at the hostel said mr fras-
ser was out and would be back late

but had left word that she was to wait
if she came and gave her the key also
an urgent closed-beam transcript had
just come in for him would she take it
up

  paul fx-assers suite had two rooms
and a window but the supply of reading
spools seemed limited to technical mate-
rial in fields that did not interest greta
and the window offered no resources but
the pitch-black clouded night of uller
studded here and there with a trail of
light as a flyer went past there didnt
seem to be much to do but sit down and
think so greta did that for a while
wondering how much more lajos knew
and what he meant to do next the lat-
ter seemed reasonably obvious he was
going to make a try for niflheim and
its beryllium but hed need a special
permit to use a reaction car for inter-
stellar travel in that case and hed have
to get it either from the uller council or
the main council of the association
back on earth and to get either one
hed probably have to have moderate
support in the councils

  of course thought greta when she
got this far that was the point that
was why lajos hadnt done anything
but let her go when he found her spying
on him he must be already in touch
with some of the moderates and his bold
answer to ingelhide had been deliber-
ately given in her hearing so she would
take word of it back to frasser he was
playing the same kind of game as the
rest and very cleverly just as he had
fooled her into thinking he was carrying
on an honest acquaintance while he was
really having an affair with that naked
dancer

  come greta she told herself at this
point you mustnt get bitter its bad
for your emotional stability where
were we oh yes lajos must have been
in touch with the moderates then the
closed-beam transcript she had brought
up for frasser would be an instruction
from shigemitsu and the other leaders
back on earth about the new policy of
cooperating with the psychs

  without any sense of eavesdropping
the long view	

and because she had always been treated
as one of the leaders of the group greta
dropped the spool into the player it
gave the series of code clicks that indi-
cated a closed-beam transmission which
could be heard on just this one single
player out of all those in the universe
and then shigemitsus voice came out
with that tiny suggestion of hissing ac-
cwnt that no one of japaneseancestry
ever quite lost

   your news is the best you could pos-
sibly send and renders the success of
our project practically certain if proper-
ly followed up of course you will have
perceived already that it is necessary to
obtain the details of this new teflon
process either from rizzi or harkavy
before they can use it for a trip to nifl-
heim the others are agreed with me
that you are to stop at nothing even
primitive means in obtaining it even
if interstellar travel is restored on the
fullest basis our group cannot fail to be
placed in charge of it and this will per-
mit us to have a majority in any council
at any time i do not think it will even
be necessary to unseat the present coun-
cil by a vote on the new marriage reg-
ulation  drop further efforts to persuade
voting members along that line i am
glad you used your influence to obtain a
special travel authorization for the girl
her usefulness there is ended and she
is so emotional that she might cause
trouble we will have to dispose of her
somehow when the program for the ex-
clusion from the scientific rolls but that
can be settled in due course remember
that rizzi is not dangerous in himself
it is harkavy you must watch and work
through

a s the message clicked off greta sat
perfectly still gripped by a kind of
numb cold horror this was the result
of her effort to make the world-the
worlds-better places for people to live
in she was a puppet a spy for a gang
even more cynical than the advanced
group headed by her father at least
the advanced group had ideals of a cer-
tain kind even if she thought they were

wrong but shigemitsu and his crew
were after nothing but personal power
just as in the primitive period there
was no one no one she could trust of
what use all the scientific advances man
had made through centuries if they only
led back by another route to the same
cold struggle for power lajos had been
right and the result of careful breeding
for intellectual attainment and emotion-
al stability under the eugenics com-
mittees had turned most scientists into
automata whose only emotional satis-
faction lay in making other people do as
they wished

  the door opened and paul frasser
came in pulling open the fastenings of
his cold-suit hello he said without
apologizing for keeping her waiting
did you find it

  greta said theres a closed-beam
urgent for you on the player from shi-
gemitsu he says youre to get har-
kavys teflon process at any cost and to
ship me home because im not useful
here any more

  the tone she used made frasser give
her a sharp look closed beam is sup-
posed to insure the privacy of communi-
cations he said

  if youre going to have spies you
must expect them to spy on you too
especially when you cheat them she
replied anger and despair mingling in
her voice

  oh come he said this business of
cheating is becoming what the psychs
call a fixation with you look at matters
rationally

  i am i have and what i see is that
youre no more interested in people as a
whole than my father you and your
gang just wanted my help to get in con-
trol of interstellar communication-and
then im not useful any more

  frasser shrugged somebody has to
control it

  why not the councils of all the sci-
ences the way its supposed to be
done

  somebody has to control them too
to decide which line of scientific endea-
	startling stories

vor will yield the greatest benefit to hu-
manity

  greta said fiercely yes ive heard
that before well im through when
i get back to earth ill have nothing
more to do with your movement no
wait i will too ill denounce it in open
council or the convention of the asso-
ciation

  i think not

  what will prevent me

  your own rational view of the con-
sequences stop and think about it logi-
cally and scientifically youll be accus-
ing part of the council and a good many
members of the association of conduct
inimical to the advancement of science
do you think theyd rather listen to you
or order you for examination as emo-
tionally unstable they wouldnt dare
let the political power have such a
chance to upset the system of scientific
regulations

tte was right greta realized as her
first flush of anger began to cool
and she remembered the years of strug-
gle it had taken to set science free from
the control of the old political govern-
ments in which not the most intelligent
but the most cunning came to the top-
with their wars and jealousies and eug-
enically bad strains breeding unchecked
she said my father-

  frasser cut her off with a laugh if
he doesnt know all about it already hes
more of a fool than i think the only
trouble is that he cant identify the peo-
ple mainly responsible you know that
try talking to him and youll find your-
self on a transport for freya as the first
victim of his purge

  greta dropped her head a little i
just wish there was someone i could
trust she said slowly and groped her
way to the door

  paul frasser watched her go with
something that was not quite a sneer
on his face he was about to put shi-
gemitsus message through the player
when something struck him and he
stepped rapidly across the room to the

phone hello he told the hostel
switchboard i want derek hyde -
 on visual closed circuit

  there was a momentary wait before
hydes head appeared on the plate his
hair tousled with sleep hello hyde
said frasser nobody with you good
i know its late and you love your rest
but this is an emergency remember
that mannjng girl the good looking one
we took to see roselle la blanche shes
been working with us but im afraid
were going to have trouble and its got
to be headed off i sent her over to locate
something at harkavys quarters dont
know- whether she found it or not but
shes just been here in a mood that
makes me pretty certain shes going to
turn sour

  hyde had a finely chiseled face of the
type that would have been called aris-
tocratic in the old days what do you
want me to do he asked look her
up and make love to her 

  stop being a fool and listen theres
just one danger and that is that shell
go to harkavy i want you to get in
touch with that building officer at his
quarters the one who gave you the tip-
offs before and have him notify you at
once if she turns up there again if she
does neither one of them must go out of
the place alive and conscious

  derek hydes aristocratic features
appeared to be undergoing a revolution
the lines from nose to mouth pinched in
and the eyebrows went up in the center
but thats physical violence he
squealed thats anti-social conduct
theyll psych me theyll take away my
mind

  listen youre playing in fast com-
pany now up with the low intelligence
number people you do what i say or
something a lot worse than a psych will
happen to you i dont care how you ar-
range it and i dont want to know but
that girl knows too much for the good
of either of us and she mustnt get it
to harkavy now move before the roof
falls in

  he snapped off the connection and
the long view	

turned frowningly to listen to shigemit-
sus message

xi	

the speaker said this is greta
manning may i come in lajos
harkavy turned over in bed snapped
back the covers with one motion
dropped a night-suit around him with
another snapped the back-switch said
come and stepped around the parti-
tion to meet her as the door of the recep-
tion-room slid back and its lights came
on

  the hood of her cold-suit was back
but she had not taken it off at the ex-
pression on her face he checked any in-
tention to make a light remark and mo-
tioned her to a seat he said id like to
spare you any embarrassment but im
afraid that as you came to see me youll
have to speak first

  all right she said her voice was
nearly toneless i had to come and tell
you i couldnt feel honest otherwise
lajos didnt sit down or say anything
youre not making it easy she said
i beg your pardon he stepped to
the back of the room turned a button
and the place was filled with the faint
scent of the pine mountains of earth
its not an emotional spray he said
merely a relaxer and crossed to sit
down opposite her have you seen
malya

                                                          

  no yes i came for something else
the spray was already taking effect
and she felt better i just wanted to
let you know that when i took the job of
-spying on you i didnt have any idea
of what was really going on

  how do you mean

  the girl made a gesture with one
hand i wonder if you understand  i
think you probably do even if you wont
say so the reason i wanted to help the
-the moderates was because my
fathers group wanted to make the pure
scientists-oh you know a privileged
caste and i didnt like it even if i do
rate as a pure scientist

  i know we talked about that back
on earth in the park beside the hud-
son

  and you told me that interstellar
travel was going to end very soon
yes said harkavy i told you that
i told it to you deliberately and it
wasnt quite true because i thought you
were in the clear and i didnt want to
see you get mixed up in the fight there
isnt much mercy for anyone in it actu-
ally there will be enough beryllium for
a small amount of space travel for them
foreseeable future but the people who
control it are going to control all the
worlds they can always send enough
of their own group in to win a vote in
the council

  greta said thats what i wanted
to tell you the moderates are as bad
as the advanced group all they want
is to control they want to put the rest
of us down to tech status and paul
frassers one of them

  i know it

  and send anyone who stands against
them to some place like freya

  i know that too

  all right did you know toijiru
shigemitsu was one of them too
lajos changed his position no i
didnt he has always behaved publicly
like a real moderate not a member of
the group thank you

  all right said greta now let me
ask you a question are you and rizzi
planning a trip to niflheim for beryl-
lium because thats what shigemitsu
thinks and hes going to do anything he
possibly can to prevent it

  lajos stood up and walked across the
floor his forehead set in afrown if
 could be sure   

  of me if i could be sure of you
how do i know that what you told in-
gelhide was just to impress me just
as when you told me that interstellar
travel was going to stop completely
only it isnt

  we dont seem to be getting any-
where-

  the red light beside the door flashed
	startling stories

  lajos stepped over to it and switched
  the button to the in position and the
  voice said urgent package delivery

  at the sound of the click lajos
  opened the delivery box in the wall
  to reveal a small container in dark
  plastic i wonder what that could be
  he said and pressed the opening slit
  the box split out on the table leaped a
  bright-colored something like a many-
  hearted jewel which turned and twisted
  urgently in a flash greta leaped from
  her seat dashed it to the floor and
  stamped on it while lajos stood look-
  ing at where it had been with slack face
  and a foolish smile greta slapped him
  hard come out of it she said

    lajos put one hand slowly up to his
  cheek then turned to her blinking
  what happened he said what was
  it

	a topological knot theyre hypnotic
  unless you know enough about pure
  mathematics to keep from being caught
  by them she lifted her foot i think
  its safe for you to look at it now
  though it wasnt made of very good
  material and ive bent it out of shape
  they use them as tests in higher mathe-
  matical training

    lajos gazed at the object curiously
  but did not attempt to pick it up it
  occurs to me he said that you could
  just as easily have let me be hypnotized
  by that thing id haye done almost any-
  thing you told me wouldnt i 

    yes

  he grinned wryly in any case
  ill have to trust you to a certain
  extent sending that thing here means
  that someone is disturbed enough about
  what im doing to be willing to take a
  chance on having his mind wiped out for
  anti-social behavior it also means
  therell be a follow-up and whoever it
  is will be plenty dangerous

     i think i know who it is said greta
  frasser shigemitsu told him to stop at
  nothing to get your transparent teflon

  i told him about it

    jft

the voice plate in firm tones said
this is a regulator tech lajos hark-
avy you are to open the door at once
he thinks hes got you under whis-
pered the girl

  there was a silence from outside
which seemed to prolong itself unbear-
ably harkavy suddenly bounced through
the side door into the studio and was as
rapidly back with the painting case and
began unsnapping it just as the voice
plate ejaculated lajos harkavy i
shall be forced to violate your privacy
unless you admit me at once
here he said thrusting the queer-
looking weapon he had used in the mac-
murray forest into the girls hands
you work it with this lever hold him
off if he gets in im going to call for
help-if they havent cut the circuit
the crack of an impulse-whip sounded
against the door panel and a six-inch
bulge appeared in it as harkavy
bounded into the studio again wham
the budge widened and a crack ran
across it slam the crack became a
gap through which a red glow showed as
the next charge crashed into the door
splitting it right across greta crowded
back toward the studio door to avoid
the shock of the next one wham- ban-
go it sent the fragments of the door
flying and part of the charge tore into
a chair across the reception room

  into the gap stepped derek hyde the
impulse-whip under his arm

  wheres harkavy he demanded
right here greta felt him beside
her but you neednt worry about me
that weapon the young lady has is
loaded with enough hydrofluoric acid to
burn a hole right through you

  ill take my chance on that said
hyde and raised the whip

  let him have it cried harkavy
its violence i cant moaned the
girl and collapsed as harkavy threw
her to the floor tumbling across her to
avoid the charge that spurted into the
studio and tore something from the wall
with a crash
the long view	

  harkavy caught just a glimpse as the
impulse-whip was lowered to finish them
   and something hit hyde from be-
hind the machine dropped from under
his arm and an expression of the most
intense surprise came across his face as
he stood stock-still utterly frozen
weapon under arm finger on trigger
the next moment the place was swarm-
ing with half a dozen regulator techs
paralyzers in hand and with marius
rizzi frowning through the group

one of the regulators said get
that impulse-whip laurie this is
about the worst case of violence ive
ever seen and i think we better take
him along without releasing anything
but the legs

  rizzi helped greta up as one of the
regulators ran the release mechanism
over hydes legs and shepherded him
clumsily toward the elevator harkavy
said marius you were certainly the
god from the machine i was trying to
phone you when that maniac started
breaking in but i couldnt reach you
what in the nine worlds persuaded you
to show up just at this time and with a
bodyguard

  rizzi said our little friend- and
then stopped and looked at greta

  its all right said harkavy shes
on our side

  rizzi flashed a frown but went on
our little friend roselle-

  roselle cried greta

  roselle la blanche is one of our very
best agents said harkavy calmly

  lajos did you know it was because
of her that i broke the acquaintance
they told me you had a connection with
her

  i do but not the kind they meant
go on marius this sounds important
our friend roselle called and said
hyde had called her in a state of consi-
derable excitement he said he was
being forced into an act of violence and
if he didnt come through he wanted her
to have his belongings well the act of
violence had to be against one of us and

as you had been watched and  hadnt i
got busy with a friend of mine in the
regulator office and came over here
harkavy said lets go into the liv-
ing room away from that wreck of a
door and work this out i dont like the
implications

  he led the way through to the seats
in front of the fireplace seated himself
and said this is frassers crowd the
moderates greta was working for them
until she found out what they were
really up to and she tells me they know
about your transparent teflon that
must be what theyre after

  i told them about it said greta
and then a closed beam came through
from shigemitsu on earth telling fras-
ser not to stop at anything

  i dont think he needed the encour-
agement said harkavy however the
question is what happens next i dont
think we can really pin anything on
frasser over this irruption of hydes
hell have the guy pre-conditioned not
to break under questioning and even
if he does frasser can always claim he
exceeded instructions and frasser
isnt the only man the moderates have
on uller id rather let him alone and
watch him than have them transfer the
executive to someone wre dont know
about yet

  may i speak said greta theres
a point that occurs to me when they
sent me here that night it was to find
your laboratory and either have you up
for unauthorized research or get the
teflon process for themselves now
hyde comes in here and tries to blow
you apart it seems to me that this
represents a change in emphasis from
wishing to use the stuff themselves to
preventing you from using it and thats
something youll have to take into ac-
count

   i believe youre right said rizzi
and that means well have to work
fast before they or the advanced group
can put a crimp in us from thecentral
council we only have two of the
suits ready but i think that gives us


startling stories

enough to just make it if-

  if what asked greta

  if we can get the travel authoriza-
tion and the reaction car

  you dont have to have it if youll
take me with you said greta i have
a special authorization that was given to
me when i broke the acquintance

  i dont know that i care for that
idea began harkavy but rizzi put out
a hand im in favor of it the fact
that the moderates are onto our plan
means that we wouldnt have much
chance of getting away with a big ship
and a heavy load in any case a reac-
tion car will just hold three one to
handle the machine and two to work
outside and all we need is a sample of
the stuff not a cargo also i have my
pilots license but there are problems
such as said greta

  well have to line the air-lock of the
car with teflon and arrange a pressure-
gear to clear it of fluorine after use
that isnt difficult in a technical sense
with the new process and it wont take
long but the minute we start work
were advertising where were going
and im afraid frasser will use the op-
portunity to pull something on us

n

xii

   lascariades was the name of
the captain of the port and by ancestry
he was a greek at the present moment
he looked acutely unhappy although his
control tower had been run up to afford
an exceptionally fine view of the port
and the weather was for uller uncom-
monly pleasant

  i am very sorry he said but in
view of the complaint that you are about
to make a journey to a point other than
that covered by your papers i cannot
give you a clearance or furnish you with
fuel

  who made the complaint asked
greta

  dont waste time said rizzi we
know who made it im the pilot of
record mr mascariades and therefore

the ships captain what evidence is
there to support the complaint

  the fact that you have altered the
air-lock of the car to resist a non-ter-
restrial type atmosphere

  you know an awful lot dont you
said rizzi i think-

  wait a minute said harkavy
thats not the way to handle this
marius mr mascariades will you get
us a phone connection with the council
executive office on visual
certainly said the captain his re-
lief showing in his voice and turned to
the instrument in a moment a squarish
face appeared on the screen and a voice
said council executive toller speak-
ing

  mr toller said harkavy i am
one of the passengers on reaction car
vak- authorized journey for miss
greta manning we have just been
refused clearance on the ground that
our papers do not show the correct
destination i beg to submit that the
destination is earth as stated but we
intend to make a stop-over at niflheim
the square face showed no sign of
relaxing th uller council has already
been apprised of that fact it cannot
authorize a clearance for niflheim
why not

  because valuable equipment belong-
ing to the association will not be allowed
to enter so corrosive an atmosphere
we have protected the airlock of the
car exterior protection is unneces-
sary

  your unsupported statement is in-
sufficient the council has considered
this question in view of information
reaching it and has decided that an
analysis of the protective coating will
be required

  harkavy said that should be simple
- but rizzi put a hand on his arm
just a moment he said may we
call back

  certainly said toller and the con-
nection was abruptly broken

  rizzi plucked at harkavys arm pull-
ing him a little aside it wont do he
the long view	

said frassej- is a perfectly competent
physical chemist with an analysis of
our transparent teflon he could dupli-
cate it just about as fast as he could
set up the apparatus

   see and then hed keep us here on
some other pretext while he made the
niflheim exploration a general associa-
tion project with himself at the head of
it very neat harkavy turned mr
mascariades will you excuse us for a
moment we need to confer in view of
the situation

  gladly said the port captain you
can use my inner office there it is sound-
proofed and has no spy ray-unless
someone has installed one recently he
took on an anxious look believe me
mr harkavy we techs will do anything
permitted by the regulations to help
you out

tphen they were in the office with
w rizzi perched on a desk and the
other two in the seats harkavy said
maybe you can suggest something
greta the way this thing is rigged
frasser can get the transparent teflon
process by an analysis we should have
lined that air-lock with opaque but its
a little late to think of that now and
besides it would make the controls hard
to get at

  the girl said wouldnt the logical
thing be to appeal from the council to
the general body of the uller associa-
tion there ought to be enough psychs
and fair-minded applied scientists in it
to give you a majority

  there are two reasons why that
wont work out said harkavy one is
that we arent exactly coming to court
with clean hands after trying to slip
away so we couldnt be sure of holding
the majority in line for a special un-
authorized project the other is even
more so frasser and his merry com-
panions would appeal to central council
back on earth and either the advanced
group would demand the new marriage
regulation as the price of letting it go
through pr theyd make it a central

council project what we have to do
is get there first and make the demon-
stration ourselves its the only way
marius and i can get enough promotion
and backing hell have to take over if

i	cant be declared adult and take my
place in the rankings

  greta had been frowning now she
said would it help if it could be proved
that the lining would stand niflheims
atmosphere without making a chemical
analysis

  it would help an awful lot said
rizzi even the moderates would find
it hard to think up another objection in
time as i understand the captain out
there all we have to furnish is proof it
doesnt matter what kind if it can be
done

  i think it can she said and stood
up  want a spectroscopic light pro-
jector and a recorder for it also an
electron microscope scalded in ang-
stroms and samples of fluorine and
hydrofluoric acid

  those you can have said rizzi
and the executive will have to send
inspectors if youre going to make a
test but youll probably get frasser
along with them

  they did accompanied by techs bear-
ing the equipment and a pair of repre-
sentatives from the council executive
one of them the square-faced toller the
other a melancholy looking man bear-
ing the name of senef frasser greeted
the others with the calm courtesy de-
manded of scientists in the presence of
the lower ratings and it was not until
they stood before the opened door of the
air-lock with greta adjusting the pro-
jector to play on it that he said what
do you propose to do

   dont know that i care to tell you
said greta do you have official status
to ask  she turned to one of the techs
i want the microscope set in phase to
catch the reflection from the metal sur-
face under the coating and the recorder
to pick up the result can you do that
miss manning it was toller i
have the official status to ask and i do
	startling stories

ask what you propose to do behind
him harkavy and rizzi exchanged
glances

  very well i propose to demonstrate
mathematically that this coating is im-
pervious to the conditions on niflheim

  frasser said gentlemen i submit
that this is absurd a simple chemical
analysis-

  would prove that the coating is
impervious to fluorine under the condi-
tions on uller not on niflheim chem-
istry isnt my branch but i do know you
cant reproduce the niflheim conditions
in a laboratory theyre too complex

  i dont think mathematical proof
would be acceptable

  the melancholy senef spoke for the
first time the councils regulation
asked for proof but did not specify the
nature of it you have given us a
good deal of trouble already mr fras-
ser and i am afraid you will have to be
bound by our decision once more
harkavy and rizzi exchanged glances

  all right said greta to one of the
techs cut in the power no thats not
quite right theres a fadeout toward
the uv can you get that set there
it looks as though its coming through
correctly now record and then move
the projector slowly along

greta tripped the holder and the
record came out a long band bear-
ing a series of waving intricate curves
now will you run light tests on those
samples of fluorine and hydrofluoric
and bring the records to me in the con-
trol tower while i analyze this one

  she led the way across the field past
the firing pits to the control wien the
group had gathered around the table in
mascariades office she spread the re-
cord of the light test out

  now gentlemen she said these
curves represent the passage of light of
different wave-lengths through the lin-
ing material it went through twice
but that neednt concern us notice that
it isnt a straight line as you might ex-
pect but a wavy curve the different

wave-lengths of light encountered vary-
ing resistances from the molecules of
the material

  the phenomenon is a familiar one
observed toller

  i know said greta now as far
as a mathematician is concerned a wave
is not a picture of something its a
graphic method of expressing a periodic
function im going to reverse the pro-
cess here and derive the function from
the graph the grid in the record will
give us our coordinates have you got a
hand calculator and a sheet of paper
she wrote rapidly as the figures ticked
in the calculator then turned to the two
council executives observe that this
function has a variable in it due to the
molecules of the lining being affected
differently by light of different wave-
lengths  and that as it progresses evenly
where the record runs out into the infra-
red and uv at the two ends it is prob-
ably an infinite series since that is the
case the values of the variable z can
only be described by a weierstrass
analytic power series

  toller turned to senef is that cor-
rect in astronomy we dont deal in this
sort of thing

  senef said its correct enough al-
most elementary but i dont see what
you expect to prove by it miss manning
the series is convergent

  you will in a minute said the girl
ah heres the record on those other
two tests now lets take the fluorine
one first the one for the acid is just
a check again she wrote and the cal-
culator clicked she handed the result to
senef will you glance that over and
see if it isnt correct i want you to
notice that its another convergent ser-
ies that is it approaches a finite num-
ber

  senefs melancholy features took on a
touch of glee i think i see what youre
driving at yes

  but if we combine the two said
greta and wrote again the result is a
new series and as you will see its di-
vergent it reaches to infinity that is
the long view	

the only point at which a combination of
fluorine and the lining material could
take place would be infinity

  senef patted his hands together soft-
ly admirable he said thoroughly
convincing toller this is the proof we
asked for we probably should have
known better than to doubt people of
this order of intelligence

  if youre satisfied- began toller
  im not said paul frasser

  senef faced him i do not know that
your opinions are a factor captain mas-
cariades you may give this car an im-
mediate clearance and a supply of fuel
adequate for reaching earth with a
stop-over at niflheim

xiii

i	he meeting is open announced
president manning and the twenty-two
members of the central council of the
association for the advancement of
science stopped their low buzz of con-
versation and settled back

  we still have pending the matter of
the new marriage regulation manning
said in the interests of-

  old henrik kool raised his hand and
said floor

  pending business should be disposed
of first

  kool said i appeal from the decision
of the chair i have new business of
such urgency that until it is disposed
of we cannot deal properly with the
pending business and indeed the at-
titude of this body toward it may be
altered by a change in the councils
composition

  please record ballots on the appeal
said manning and turned to face the
voting board where the balloting done
by keys in the arms of the seats was
automatically recorded two first rate
scientists in favor of the appeal six
votes two second rate four votes nine
third rate nine votes total nineteen out
of thirty-five the appeal is supported
mr kool state your new business

i wish to present lajos harkavy

bc-- who has succeeded in reach-
ing niflheim and returning with proof
that it contains ample supplies of beryl-
lium to last the whole bystem for many
hundreds of years of unrestricted in-
terstellar travel and that it can be
handled safely

  is there any confirmation of the
facts asked manning as calmly as
though he did not know what was com-
ing

  a man near the middle of the room
raised his hand the chemical section
confirms he said not only was a
quantity of high-grade beryllium ore
brought back but also optical crystals of
calcium fluoride of high indicated value
you may present said manning
kool stepped to the door and admitted
harkavy greta and rizzi leading them
to seats at the front of the council room
when they were seated he faced the
group in view of the achievement of
lajos harkavy i ask a seat on this
council for him with the rank of first
rate scientist and i ask a seat for mar-
ius rizzi his assistant with the rank of
third rate scientist

  a woman with dark hair one of man-
nings advanced group claimed the
floor and said objection if rizzi made
the discoveries he should be promoted
but not harkavy

  kool said mr rizzi will you tell us
about it

  rizzi stood up the process by which
protective plating for use in a fluorine
atmosphere was developed was entirely
due to harkavy i furnished only the
laboratory and technical assistance
the objector remained on her feet
unauthorized research

  harkavy spoke for the first time
the research was done on uller thats
why i went there its an outer class c
planet and no authorization is required
provided only local materials are used
the woman sat down but another
man raised his hand i have an objec-
tion as a member of the eugenics com-
mittee according to our records mr
harkavy is not an adult and therefore
	startling stories

cannot have either the rating you ask
or a seat on this council

  i will move a regulation by this
body to declare him adult said kool
in view of attainments beyond those
of anyone here it is deserved

  the objector looked at a note and
clung to his point according to the
records mr harkavy lacks two years of
the required age if we are to make
special regulations in individual cases
we might as well not have any regula-
tions at all it is hopelessly unscientific
science admits of no exceptions
harkavy stood up may i speak i
could name a few exceptions science
admits and i can name one in the re-
gulations when a person of my age has
made a marriage authorized by the eu-
genics committee he is assumed to be

stable enough to be declared adult

  but youre not married youe not
even on acquaintance

  oh yes i am ask marius rizzi if
you wish

  rizzi said as captain of a ship in
deep space i was authorized to perform
marriages even when not authorized
of course there were only three of us
aboard and it wasnt much of a cere-
mony but when they asked me i could
not very well refuse-could i

  in the applause and murmurs that
ran through the group it was a couple of
minutes before henrik kool could get
enough attention to say in the light of
the evidence before us i do not think
there can be any objection to voting the
regulations i have asked

   there was not

to the immaculate public servant the alien in human
form was a deadly menace which must be hunted down
and destroyed but you may disagree when you read-

  hie planet is
named uller it
seems that in inter-
stellar travel the
names of norse
gods instead of
greek were applied
to the few habitable
worlds it is the
second planet of the star beta ilydri
right angle  declension - go
solar type star of approximately the
same size as the sun distance from
earth  light years

  uller revolves around beta hydri in a
nearly circular orbit at a distance of
 miles making it a little cold-
er than earth a year is of the approxi-
mate length of that on earth a day lasts
 hours

  the axis of uller is in the same plane
as the orbit so that at a certain time of
the year the north pole is pointed di-
rectly at the sun while at the opposite
end of the orbit it points directly away
the result is highly exaggerated sea-
sons at the poles the temperature runs
from  c to a low of - c at the
equator it remains not far from plus 
c all year round strong winds during
the summer and winter from the hot to
the cold pole few winds during the
spring and fall the appearance of the
poles varies during the year from baked
deserts to glaciers covered with solid
co free water exists in the equatorial
regions all year round

	solar movement as seen

 from uller	

  as seen from the north pole-no sun
visible on jan  on april  it bisects
the horizon all day swinging completely
around april  to july  it continues
swinging around gradually rising in the
sky the spiral converging to its center
at the zenith which it reaches on july

	from july to october  the spiral
starts again spreading out from the cen-
ter until on october  it bisects the hori-
zon again on october  night arrives
again and stays until april 

  at the equator the sun is visible bi-
secting the southern horizon for all 
hours of the day on january  from
january  to april  the sun starts to
dip below the horizon at night to rise
higher above it during the day during
all this time it rises and sets at the
same hours but rises in the southeast
and sets in the southwest at noon it is
higher each day in the southern sky
until april  when it rises due east
passes through the zenith and sets due
east from april  to july  its noon
position drops down to the north until
on july  it is visible all day bisected
by the northern horizon

	chemistry and geology of

  uller

  calcium and chlorine are rarer than
on earth sodium is somewhat common-


	startling stories

er as a result of the shortage of cal-
cium there is a higher ratio of silicates
to carbonates than exists on earth the
water is slightly alkaline and resembles
a very dilute solution of sodium silicate
water glass it would have a ph of
 and would taste slightly soapy also
when it dries out it leaves a sticky and
then a glassy crackly film rocks look
fairly earthlike but the absence or
scarcity of anything like limestone is
noticeable practically all the sediment-
ary rocks are of the sandstone type

	animal life

  life developed as it did on earth in
the permanent waters but because of
the abundance of silicon there was a
strong tendency for the microscopic or-
ganisms to develop silicate exoskeletons
like diatoms the present invertebrate
animal life of the plant is of this type
and is confined to the equatorial seas
they run from amoeba-like objects to
things like crayfish with silicate skele-
tons later some species of these start-
ed taking the silicon into their soft tis-
sues and eventually their carbon-chain
compounds were converted to silicone

type chains from - d - c -  - c - to

 i	i	i

cals on the side links these organisms
were a transitional type with silicone
tissues and water body fluids resem-
bling the earthly amphibians and are
now practically extinct there are a few
species something like segmented
worms still to be seen in backwaters of
the central seas

  a further development occurred when
the silicone-chain animals began to get
short-chain silicones into their circula-
tory systems held in solution by oh or
nh groups on the ends and branches
of the chains the proportion of these
compounds gradually increased until the
water was a minor and then a missing

constituent the larger mobile species
then were practically anhydrous their
blood consists of short-chain silicones
wtih quartz reinforcing and their armor
teeth etc of pure amorphous quartz
opal most of these parts are of the
milky variety variously tinted with
metallic impurities as are the varieties
of sapphires

  these pure silicone animals due to
their practical indestructibility anni-
hilated all but the smaller of the carbon
animals and drove the compromise types
into odd corners as relics they devel-
oped into a fish-like animal-with a very
large swim-bladder to compensate for
the rather higher density of the silicone
tissues-and from these fish the land
animals developed due to their high
density and resulting high weight they
tend to be low to the ground rather
reptilian in look three pairs of legs are
usual in order to distribute the heavy
load there is no sharp dividing line
between the quartz armor and the sili-
cone tissue one merges into the other

  the dominant pure silicone animals
only could become mobile and venture
far from the temperate equatorial re-
gions of uller for they alone were inde-
pendent of the planets violent climate
since they neither froze nor stiffened
with cold nor boiled off when it got real-
ly hot note that all animal life on this
planet is cold-blooded with a negligible
difference between body and ambient
temperatures since the animals are sili-
cones they dont get sluggish like cold
snakes

 plant life

  the plants are of the carbon metabol-
ism-silicate shell type like the primitive
animals they spread out from the equat-
or as far as they could go before the bak-
ing polar summers killed them they had
normal seasonal growth in the temper-
ate zones and remained dormant and
frozen solid during the winter at the
poles there is no vegetation-not be-
cause of the cold winters but because
the silicone world	

of the hot summers the cold winter
winds frequently blow over dead trees
and roll them as far as the equatorial
seas other dead vegetation because of
the highly silicious water always gets
petrified like the petrified forest unless
it gets eaten first what with the quartz-
speckled hides of the living vegetation
and the solid quartz of the dead a forest
is spectacular

   the silicone animals live on the plants
they chomp them up dehydrate them
and convert their silicious outer bark
and carbonaceous interiors into silicones
for themselves when silicone tissue is
metabolized the carbon and hydrogen go
to co and h which are breathed out
while the silicon goes into sio which is
deposited as more teeth and armor
compare the terrestrial octopus which
makes armor plating out of calcium
urate instead of excreting urea or uric
acid the animals can of course eat
each other too or try to make a meal
of the small carbonaceous animals of the
equatorial seas

  further note that the animals cannot
digest plants when they are cold they
can eat them and store them but the
disposal of the solid water and c is
too difficult a problem when they warm
up the water in the plants melts and
can be disposed of and things are sim-
pler

  all rivers are seasonal running from
the polar regions to the central seas in
the spring only or until the polar cap is
completely dried out

the fluorine planet

          

  the planet named niflheim is the
fourth planet of nu puppis right angle
 declension - b type star
blue-white and hot  light years dis-
tant from the earth which will require
a speed in excess of light to reach it

  niflheim is  miles from its
primary a little less than the distance
of jupiter from our sun it thus does
not receive too great a total amount of
energy but what it does receive is of

high potential a large fraction of it be-
ing in the ultra-violet and higher fre-
quencies watch out for really super-
special sunburn etc on unwarned per-
sonnel

  the gravity of niflheim is approxi-
mately  g the atmospheric pressure ap-
proximately  atmosphere and the aver-
age ambient temperature about - c

  the oxidizer in the atmosphere is free
fluorine f in a rather low concentra-
tion about  or  per cent with it ap-
pears a mad collection of gases there
are a few inert diluants such as n
nitrogen argon helium neon c but
the major fraction consists of cf car-
bon tetrafluoride bfs boron triflu-
oride sif silicon tetrafluoride pf
phosphorous pentafluoride sf sul-
phur hexafluoride and probably others
in other words the fluorides of all the
non-metals that can form fluorides the
phosphorous pentafluoride rains out
when the weather gets cold there is also
free oxygen but no chlorine that would
be liquid except in very hot weather it
sometimes appears combined with flu-
orine in chlorine trifluoride the atmos-
phere on examination has a slight yel-
lowish tinge

	soil and geology

  above the metallic core of the planet
the lithosphere consists exclusively of
fluorides of the metals there are no ox-
ides sulfides silicates or chlorides there
are small deposits of such things as bro-
mine trifluoride but these have no great
importance since fluorides are weak me-
chanically the terrain is flattish noth-
ing tough like granite to build mountains
out of since the fluoride ion is color-
less the color of the soil depends upon
the predominant metal in the region
as most of the light metals also have
colorless ions the colored rocks are rath-
er rare
		startling stories

	the waters under the
  earth

   they consist of liquid hydrofluoric
acid hf it melts at - c and boils
at  c in it are dissolved varying
quantities of metallic and non-metallic
fluorides such as boron trifluoride sodi-
um fluoride etc when the oceans and
lakes freeze they do so from the bottom
up so there is no layer of ice over free
liquid

	plants and plant metabo-
  lism

   the plants function by photosynthe-
sis taking hf as water from the soil
and carbon tetrafluoride as the equiva-
lent of carbon dioxide from the air to
produce chain compounds such as

      h h h h

             - i - c - c - c -

        i i i
        f f f f

and at the same time liberating free
fluorine this reaction could only take
place on u planet receiving lots of ultra-
violet because so much energy is needed
to break up carbon tetrafluoride and
hydrofluoric acid the plant catalyst
doubling for the magnesium in chloro-
phyl is nickel the plants are colored
in various ways they get their metals
from the soil

	animals and animal metab-
  olism

   animals depend upon two main re-
actions for their energy and for the
construction of their harder tissues the
soft tissues are about the same as the
plant molecules but the hard tissues
are produced by the reaction

the blood catalyst metal is titanium
which results in colorless arterial blood

	some effects on intruding

 items

  water decomposes into oxygen and
hydrofluoric acid all organic matter
earth type converts into oxygen car-
bon tetrafluoride hydrofluoric acid etc
with more or less speed a rubber gas

	why go there

  of great interest naturally are the
properties of the planet which we may
employ

  large natural crystals of fluorides
such as calcium difluoride titanium tet-
rafluoride zirconium tetrafluoride are
extremely useful in optical instruments
of various forms uranium appears as
uranium hexafluoride all ready for the
diffusion process compounds of such
non-metals as boron are obtainable from
the atmosphere in high purity with very
little trouble all metallurgy must be
electrical

  there are considerable deposits of
beryllium and they occur in high con-
centration in its ores

by philip jose farmer

   riar sparks sat wedged between
the wall and the realizer he was mo-
tionless except for his forefinger and
his eyes from time to time his finger
tapped rapidly on the key upon the desk
and now and then his irises gray blue as
his native irish sky swiveled to look
through the open door of the toldiua in
which he crouched the little shanty on

the poopdeck visibility was low

  outside was dusk and a lantern by
the railing two sailors leaned on it
beyond them bobbed the bright lights
and dark shapes of the nina and the
pinta and beyond them was the smooth
horizon-brow of the atlantic edged in
black and blood by the red dome of the
rising moon

  the luminiferous ether crackled and
hissed tonight but the phones clamped
over his ears carried along with them
the steady dots and dashes sent by the
operator at the las palmas station on
the grand canary

zzisss so you are out of sherry al-

no one of us would do that it is a
falsity spread by our enemies in the
church to discredit us but many people
believe that   

  how close does the admiral calculate

ing for us   

  pop  this will kill you    two
irish mercenaries by the name of pat
and mike were walking down the street
of granada when a beautiful saracen
lady leaned out of a balcony and emptied
a pot of    hiss   and pat looked up
and

  crackle  good hah brother juan
told that last night   

  pv    pv    are you coming
in    pv    pv   yes i know
its dangerous to bandy such jests about

but nobody is monitoring us tonight 
zzz  i think theyre not anyway 

  and so the ether bent andwarped
with their messages and presently
friar sparks tapped out the pv that
ended their talk the pax vobiscum then
he pulled the plug out that connected
his earphones to the set and lifting
them from his ears clamped them down
forward over his temples in the regula-
tion manner

a fter sidling bent-kneed from the
toldilla punishing his belly against
the desks hard edge as he did so he
walked over to the railing de salcedo
and de torres were leaning there and
talking in low tones the big bulb above
gleamed on the pages redgold hair and
on the interpreters full black beard it
also bounced pinkishly off the priests
smoothshaven jowls and the light scar-
let robe of the rogerian order his cowl
thrown back served as a bag for scratch-
paper pens an ink bottle tiny wrenches
and screwdrivers a book on cryptogra-
phy a sliderule and a manual of angelic
principles

  well old rind said young de salcedo
familiarly what do you hear from las
palmas 

  nothing now too much interference
from that

  he pointed to the moon riding the
horizon ahead of them

  what an orb bellowed the priest
its as big and red as my revered nose
the two sailors laughed and de sal-
cedo said but it will get smaller and
paler as the night grows father and
your proboscis will on the contrary be-
come larger and more sparkling in in-
verse proportion according to the square
of the ascent-

  he stopped and grinned for the monk
had suddenly dipped his nose like a
porpoise diving into the sea raised it
again like the same animal jumping
from a wave and then once more
plunged it into the heavy currents of
their breathe nose to nose he faced
them his twinkling little eyes seeming
sail on

to emit sparks like the realizer in his
toldilla

  again porpoise-like he sniffed and
snuffed several times quite loudly then
satisfied with what he had gleaned from
their breaths he winked at them he
did not however mention his findings
at once preferring to sidle towards the
subject

  he said this father sparks on the
grand canary is so entertaining he
stimulates me with all sorts of philo-
sophical notions both valid and fantas-
tic for instance tonight just before
we were cut off by that-he gestured
at the huge bloodshot eye in the sky-
he was discussing what he called
worlds of parallel time tracks an idea
originated by dvsphagius of gotham

  its his idea there may be other
worlds in coincident but not contacting
universes that god being infinite and
of unlimited creative talent and ability
the master alchemist in other words
has possibly-perhaps necessarily-cre-
ated a plurality of continua in which
every probable event has happened

  huh  grunted de salcedo

  exactly thus columbus was turned
down by queen isabella so this attempt
to reach the indies across the atlantic
was never made so we would not now
be standing here plunging ever deeper
into oceanus in our three cockleshells
there would be no booster buoys strung
out between us and the canaries and
father sparks at las palmas and i on
the santa maria would not be carrying
on our fascinating conversations across
the ether

  or say roger bacon was persecuted
by the church instead of being encour-
aged and giving rise to the order whose
inventions have done so much to insure
the monopoly of the church on alchemy
and its divinely inspired guidance of
that formerly pagan and hellish prac-
tice

  de torres opened his mouth but the
priest silenced him with a magnificent
and imperious gesture and continued

   or even more ridiculous but thought

sail on	

provoking he speculated just this eve-
ning on universes with different physical
laws one in particular i thought very
droll as you probably dont know an-
gelo angelei has proved by dropping
objects from the leaning tower of pisa
that different weights fall at different
speeds

  my delightful colleague on the grand
canary is writing a satire which takes
place in a universe where aristotle is
made out to be a liar where all things
drop with equal velocities no matter
what their size

  silly stuff but it helps to pass the
time we keep the ether busy without
little angels

  de salcedo said uh i dont want to
seem too curious about the secrets of
your holy and cryptic order friar
sparks but these little angels your
machine realizes intrigue me is it a sin
to presume to ask about them 

  the monks bull roar slid to a dove
cooing

  whether its a sin or not depends
let me illustrate young fellows if you
were concealing a bottle of say very
scarce sherry on you and you did not
offer to share it with a very thirsty old
gentleman that would be a sin a sin
of omission

  but if you were to give that desert-
dry that pilgrim-weary that devout
humble and decrepit old soul a long
soothing refreshing and stimulating
draught of lifegiving fluid daughter of
the vine i would find it in my heart to
pray for you for that deed of loving-
kindness of encompassing charity and
it would please me so much i might tell
you a little of our realizer not enough
to hurt you just enough so you might
gain more respect for the intelligence
and glory of my order

tle salcedo grinned conspiratorial-
ly and passed the monk the bottle
hed hidden under his jacket as the
friar tilted it and the chug-chug-chug
of vanishing sherry became louder the
two sailors glanced meaninefullv at each
	startling stories

other no wonder the priest reputed to
be so brilliant in his branch of the al-
chemical mysteries had yet been sent off
on this half-baked voyage to devil-knew-
where the church had calculated that
if he survived well and good if he didnt
then he would sin no more

  the monk wiped his lips on his sleeve
belched loudly as a horse and said
gracias boys from my heart so deep-
ly buried in this fat i thank you an
old irishman dry as a camels hoof
choking to death with the dust of absti-
nence thanks you you have saved my
life

  thank rather that magic nose of
yours replied de salcedo now old
rind now that youre well greased again
would you mind explaining as much as
you are allowed about that machine of
yours

  friar sparks took fifteen minutes at
the end of that time his listeners asked
a few permitted questions

      and you say you broadcast on
a frequency of  kc the page
asked what does kc mean 

  k stands for the french kilo from
a greek word meaning thousand and
c stands for the hebrew cherubim the
little angels angel comes from the
greek angelos meaning messenger it
is our concept that the ether is crammed
with these cherubim these little mes-
sengers thus when we friar sparks
depress the key of our machine we are
able to realize some of the infinity of
messengers waiting for just such a de-
mand for service

 so  kc means that in a given
unit of time  cherubim line
up and hurl themselves across the ether
the nose of one being brushed by the
feathertips of the cherubs wings ahead
the height of the wingcrests of each
little creature are even so that if you
were to draw an outline of the whole
train there would be nothing to distin-
guish one cherub from the next the
whole column forming that grade of lit-
tle angels known as c w

  cw

  continuous wingheight my machine
is a cw realizer

   young de salcedo said my mind reels
such a concept such a revelation it
almost passes comprehension imagine
the aerial of your realizer is cut just so
long so that the evil cherubim surging
back and forth on it demand a predeter-
mined and equal number of good angels
to combat them and this seduction
coil on the realizer crowds bad angels
into the left-hand the sinister side and
when the bad little cherubim are crowd-
ed so closely and numerously that they
cant bear each others evil company
they jump the spark gap and speed
around the wire to the good plate

  and in this racing back and forth
they call themselves to the attention of
the little messengers the yea-saying
cherubim and you friar sparks by
manipulating your machine thus-and-
so and by lifting and lowering your key
you bring these invisible and friendly
lines of carriers your etheric and winged
postmen into reality and you are able
thus to communicate at great distances
with your brothers of the order
great god said de torres

tt was not a vain oath but a pious
exclamation of wonder his eyes
bulged it was evident that he suddenly
saw that man was not alone that on
every side piled on top of each other
flanked on every angle stood a host
black and white they presented a solid
chessboard of the seemingly empty cos-
mos black for-the nay-sayers white for
the yea-sayers maintained by a hand
in delicate balance and subject as the
fowls of the air and the fish of the sea
to exploitation by man

  yet de torres having seen such a
vision  has made a saint of many a
man couid only ask perhaps you could
tell me how many angels may stand on
the point of a pin

  obviously de torres would never wear
a halo he was destined if he lived to
cover his bony head with the mortar-
board of a university teacher
sail on

  de salcedo snorted

   ill tell you philosophically speaking
you may put as many angels on a pin-
head as you want to actually speaking
you may put only as many as there is
room for

  enough of that im interested in
facts not fancies tell me how could
the moons rising interrupt your recep-
tion of the cherubim sent by the sparks
at las palmas

  great caesar how would i know
am i a repository of universal knowl-
edge no not i a humble and ignorant
friar i all i can tell you is that last
night it rose like a bloody tumor on the
horizon and that when it was up i had
to quit marshaling my little messengers
in their short and long columns the
canary station was quite overpowered
so that both of us gave up and the
same thing happened tonight

  the moon sends messages asked de
torres

  not in a code i can decipher but it
sends yes

  santa maria

  perhaps suggested de salcedo
there are people on that moon and they
are sending

  friar sparks blew derision through
his nose enormous as were his nostrils
his derision was not small bore artillery
of contempt laid down a barrage that
would have silenced any but the strong-
est of souls

  maybe de torres spoke in a low
tone maybe if the stars are windows
in heaven as ive heard said the angels
of the higher hierarchy the big ones
are realizing-uh-the smaller and they
only do it when the moon is up so we
may know it is a celestial phenomenon

  he crossed himself and looked around
the vessel

  you need not fear said the monk
gently there is no inquisitor leaning
over your shoulder remember i am the
only priest on this expedition moreover
your conjecture has nothing to do with
dogma

  however thats unimportant heres

sail on	

what i dont understand how can a
heavenly body broadcast why does it
have the same frequency as the one im
restricted to why-

   i could explain interrupted de sal-
cedo with all the brashness and impa-
tience of y uth i could say that the
admiral and the rogerians are wrong
about the earths shape i could say the
earth is not round but is flat i could
say the horizon exists not because we
live upon a globe but because the earth
is curved only a little ways like a greatly
flattened out hemisphere

   i could also say that the cllrubim are
coming not from luna but from a ship
such as ours a vessel which is hanging
in the void off the edge of the earth
what  gasped the other two

ttavent you heard that the king of
portugal secretly sent out a ship
after he turned down columbus pro-
posal  how do we know he did not that
the messages are not from our predeces-
sor that he sailed off the worlds rim and
is now suspended in the air and becomes
exposed at night because it follows the
moon around terra is in fact a much
smaller and unseen satellite

  the monks laughter woke many men
on the ship 

   ill have to tell the las palmas oper-
ator your tale he can put it in that
novel of his next youll be telling me
those messages are from one of those
fire-shooting sausages so many credu-
lous laymen have been seeing flying
around no my dear de salcedo lets not
be ridiculous even the ancient greeks
knew the earth was round every uni-
versity in europe teaches that and we
rogerians have measured the circum-
ference we know for sure that the in-
dies lie just across the atlantic just as
we know for sure through mathematics
that heavier-than-air machines are im-
possible our friar ripskulls our mind-
doctors have assured us these flying
creations are mass hallucinations or else
the tricks of heretics or turks who want
to panic the populace
	startling stories

  that moon radio is no delusion ill
grant you what it is i dont know but
its not a spanish or portuguese ship
what about its different code even if
it came from lisbon that ship would
still have a rogerian operator and he
would according to our policy be of a
different nationality than the crew so
he might the easier stay out of political
embroilments he wouldnt break our
laws by using a different code in order
to communicate with lisbon we disci-
ples of st roger do not stoop to petty
boundary intrigues moreover that real-
izer would not be powerful enough to
reach europe and must therefore be
directed at us

  de torres shivered and crossed him-
self again

  perhaps the angels are warning us
of approaching death  perhaps 
perhaps then why dont they use
our code angels would know it as well
as i no there is no perhaps the order
does not permit perhaps it experiments
and finds out nor does it pass judgment
until it knows

  i doubt well ever know said de sal-
cedo gloomily columbus has promised
the crew that if we come across no sign
of land by evening tomorrow we shall
turn back otherwise-he drew a fin-
ger across his throat-kkk another
day and well be pointed east and get-
ting away from that evil and bloody-
looking moon and its incomprehensible
messages

  it would be a great loss to the order
and to the church sighed the friar
but i leave such things in the hands of
god and inspect only what he hands me
to look at

  with which pious statement friar
sparks lifted the bottle to ascertain the
liquid level having determined in a
scientific manner its existence he next
measured its quantity and tested its
quality by putting all of it in that best of
all chemistry tubes - his enormous
belly

  afterwards smacking his lips and ig-
noring the pained and disappointed looks

on the faces of the sailors he went on
to speak enthusiastically of the water-
screw and the engine which turned it
both of which had been built recently at
the st jonas college at genoa if isa-
bellas three ships had been equipped
with those he declared they would not
have to depend upon the wind however
so far the fathers had forbidden its
extended use because it was feared the
engines fumes might poison the air
and the terrible speeds it made possible
might be fatal to the human body

  after which he plunged into a tedious
description of the life of his patron saint
the inventor of the first cherubim real-
izer and receiver jonas of carcassonne
who had been martyred when he grabbed
a wire he thought was insulated

  the two sailors found excuses to walk
off the monk was a good fellow but
hagiography bored them besides they
wanted to talk of women 

tf columbus had not succeeded in
persuading his crews to sail one more
day events would have been different

  at dawn the sailors were very much
cheered by the sight of several large
birds circling their ships land could
not be far off perhaps these winged
creatures came from the coast of fabled
cipangu itself the country whose houses
were roofed with gold

  the birds swooped down closer they
were enormous and very strange their
bodies were flattish and almost saucer-
shaped and small in proportion to the
wings which had a spread of at least
thirty feet nor did they have legs

  only a few sailors saw the significance
of that fact these birds dwelt in the
air and never rested upon land or sea

  while they were meditating upon that
they heard a slight sound as of a mar
clearing his throat so gentle and far
off was the noise that nobody paid any
attention to it for each thought his
neighbor had made it

  a few minutes later the sound canu
again this time it was louder and deep-
er like a lute string being twanged
sail on

  everybody looked up heads were
turned west

  even yet they did not understand that
the noise like a finger plucking a wire
came from the line that held the earth
together and that line was stretched
to its utmost and that the violent finger
of the sea was what had plucked the line

  it was some time before they under-
stood

  they had run out of horizon

when thev saw that they were too
late

  the dawn had not only come up like
thunder it vas thunder and though
the three ships heeled over at once and
tried to sail closehauled on the port tack
the suddenly speeded up and relentless
current made beating hopeless

  then it was the rogarian wished for
the genoese screw and-the woodburning
engine that would have made them able
to resist the terrible muscles of the
charging and bull-like sea

  then it was that some men prayed
some raved some tried to attack the

sail on	

admiral some jumped overboard and
some sank into a stupor

  only the fearless columbus and the
courageous friar sparks stuck to their
duties all that day the fat monk
crouched wedged in his little shanty
dotdashing to his fellow on the grand
canary he ceased only when the moon
rose like a huge red bubble from the
throat of a dying giant then he listened
intently all night and worked desper-
ately scribbling and swearing impiously
and checking cipherbooks

  when the dawn came up again in a
roar and a rush he ran from the toldilla
a piece of paper clutched in his hand
his eyes were wild and his lips were
moving fast but nobody could under-
stand that he had cracked the code

  their ears were too overwhelmed to
hear a mere human voice the throat-
clearing and the twanging of the string
had been the noises preliminary to the
concert itself now came the mighty
overture as compelling as the blast of
gabriels horn was the topple of oceanus
into space

it was a fantastic prison world    where slave-creatures
of a hundred spheres dreamed and plotted escape read-

heard the click of the keys cutting tape
on the receiver

  the sergeant returned his attention
to the checker board and jumped two
men before he bothered to look up at the
viewer he saw a streak of light move
upward and across the screen in a wide
expected curve from right to left
reached over to inspect the fresh-cut
tape and grunted approval

  bb- coming in at    all
correct he said check em off joe
thats nine thirty-eight and one-oh-
seven at the point of entry all in corre-
lation transmission clear its your

  fromm picked up the clipboard with

this is a love story that is to say
it is a story of the greatest need and
greatest fear men know it is also a
story of conquest and defeat of courage
and cowardice and the heroism that is
a product of both of them it begins in
security and isolation it ends in victory
and desecration whoever you are this
story has happened to you already and
will again whoever you are however
you live you are writing the ending to
the story with every breath you take
with every move you make

  in the cabin of the service rocket
scanliter six sergeant bolster and his
new crewman pfc joe fromm were
playing checkers it was the bored third

you are by juditb mebbil

day of a routine one-week tour of duty
on the web checking the activities of
the scanner-satellites that held the tight-
woven mesh of e-m-g in a hollow sphere
of protective power cast around the
system

  fromm studied the board soberly
sighed and moved a man into unavoid-
able trouble bolster smiled and both
of them looked up momentarily as they

the scanlite-station checkoff chart and
marked three tiny squares with his ini-
tials almost without looking he was
still staring at the view-screen empty
now of everything but the distant specks
of light that were the stars

  hey bolster said again its your
move

  joe fromm didnt even hear him the
scanner outside completed its revolution


	startling stories

around the small ship and    there it
was again the flaring trail of rockets
traveled across the screen independent
of the up-and-down motion of the re-
volving scanner

tvhe sergeant grunted again whats

  the matter didnt you ever see one
home before

  thats the first fromm said with-
out turning shouldnt we be recording
the tape

  not yet bolster surveyed the
checker board sadly hed have a king
on the next move  if fromm ever
made another move all we got now
is radar-recog then    there you
are   he nodded at the renewed
clacking of the keys thatll be the
code-dope coming in then we wait till
after it hits detection and we get the
last ok before we send the tape to the
post

   he explained it all dutifully just the
same it used to be when they sent a
new man out they at least took him on
a practice tour first look make a
move will you you got a whole year
here to sit and look at em come in

   with difficulty the pfc took his eyes
off the viewer touch a piece on the board
at random and pushed it forward leav-
ing bolster with the choice of a three-
man jump to nowhere or the one-man
jump that would net him his king the
private leaned forward to finger the tape
as it emerged from the receiver reading
off the replies to code-dope demands and
signal responses with a cei-tain reverent
intensity did you ever see an illegal
entry he asked i mean an attempt
somebody told me there was one on this
sect

  at that instant the bb- hit the de-
tector field awaiting it at the point of
entry on the web and generated me-
chanical panic in an entire sequence of
scanlite instruments synchronized
pulses from the three scanlite stations
circling the point of entry transmitted
their frustration in the face of the un-
precedented and unpredicted and the

tape in the cabin of scanliter six vi-
brated out of the recorder under the
furious impact of the chattering keys

  alarm bells began to shrill first in
the small cabin directly over the ser-
geants head then in similar cabins on
four other scanliter rockets within
range finally about two minutes later
in the exec office at phobos post which
was the nearest solar defense base to
the point of entry at the time

  pfc joe fromm stopped his hesitant
query in mid-word feeling vaguely
guilty for having brought the subject
up sergeant bolster knocked over the
checker board reaching for the tape he
read it paled visibly passed it across
to the private and started transmitting
to the post almost at the same instant

  on phobos a signal tech depressed
three levers on his switchboard before
he stopped to wonder what was wrong
green alarm meant emergency calls to
the od psychofficer and pr chief
the tech sent out the summons then
stopped to read the tape

  by the time the phobos post comman-
der got up from his dinner table the
psychofficer put down the kitten he was
playing with and the public relations
deputy pushed back the stool at her
dressing table the crews of all five scan-
liters within range of the point of entry
as well as the signals tech on phobos
knew all the pertinent details of what
had occurred

  the baby byrd iii a five-man star-
scout under command of captain james
malcolm due back after almost a full
year out of system had approached a
point of entry just outside the orbit of
saturn on the electro-magneto-gravitic
web of force that surrounded the solar 
system it had signalled the correct
radar recognition pattern and replied to
whoever

the challenge of the scanlite stations
circling the point ofentry with the an-
ticipated code responses accordingly
the point had been softened to permit
entry of the ship and a standard detec-
tor field set up around the soft spot

  thus far it was routine homecoming
for a starscout it was only when the
bb- entered the detector field that the
automatics on the scanner-satellite sta-
tions began to shrill the alarms for
human help the field registered no
human electro-magnetic emanations on
board the bb- the e-m pattern it got

you are	

the membrane of force that guarded the
system from intrusion had in turn to
be guarded and maintained by the men
who lived within it the scanner-satel-
lites were as nearly infallible as a ma-
chine can be they might have run
effectively for centuries on their own
very slowly diminishing feedback-power
systems but mans security was too
precious a thing to trust entirely to the
products of mans ingenuity each year
a new group of the systems youth was
called to service and at the end of the
year a few were chosen from among

it has been remarked before that sdence-fiction writers peering into
the future tend to be rather gloomy about the human race we can
only say they have plenty of reason case in point is the army air
force order during the recent flying saucer tumult to shoot on sight-
an order later rescinded with confusion as though gifted with prevision
judy merril had already written and sold us a story of mans first contact
with aliens from outside of the confusion the fear the suspicion of that
contact

  shes done more than write a glib story of the mechanics involved
with the conventional ending shes dug under the surface uncovered
the motives most of us hide produced people as real in their future
problem as those you know and her conclusion it will keep you won-
dering until the very end

-the editor

was undoubtedly alive    and just as
undeniably alien

  for the third time in the history of
the web an attempt at entry had been
made by unauthorized aliens and those
aliens were apparently in sole possession
of a solar starscout the third attempt
   and the third failure the bb- was
already secured in a slightly intensified
smaller sphere of the same e-m-g mesh
that made up the web suspended at mid-
point between the three circling scanlite
stations

eternal vigilance is most assured-
ly the price of the peace of the womb

the volunteers to man the scanliters that
serviced the satellite stations which
comprised the web

  for even the most adventurous of
youths one further year of scanliting
was usually enough they came back
from their fifty tours outside prepared
to keep their feet on solid ground and
to forget the brief experience of facing
the unknown but each year too there
were a few of them who learned to crave
the intoxication of danger who could
no longer be content to settle back into
the warm security of the system it was
these warped veterans of the web who
became byrdmen

  secure within the womb-enclosure of
the web five billion solar citizens could
w-reak their wills upon their little
  

worlds and carry on the
complex design for nourishment of all
the intra-system castes and categories

   otuside the emissaries of mankind
streaked through the heavens on their
chariots of fire -spreading the solar cul-
ture through galactic space spawning
the seeds of men between the stars first
went the baby byrds to scout new lands
beyond the farthest outposts then the
byrds with their full complements of
scientists and giant laboratories to test
the promise of the newly-charted plan-
ets and after them the giant one-way
starships went

  somehow there were always just
enough bold desperate souls yearning
for danger and ready to die for a dream
to fill the human cargo-couches of the
colony ships the mayflowers and liv-
ingstons and columbos that left the
safety of the web forever to fix new
germ-cells of humanity on far-flung
planets in the speckled skies

  inside the web on four inhabited
planets and half a thousand habitable
asteroids men lived in the light of the
sun by day and drew their warmth and
power from it by night they turned to
rest at peace each one under his own
sector of the high-domed sky the hollow
sphere of force through which no alien
source of light could penetrate and still
retain identity

   the web glowed always with the min-
gled and diffracted energy of all the
universe outside no photon passed its
portals no smallest particle of energy
came through without the necessary
pause for hail-and-password that main-
tained the calm security of the webs
inner light

startling stories

ever more that was too bright to look at comfort-
ably scanner rays could not possibly
penetrate the thick field that held the
bb- suspended in the web

   well bolster said sourly heres
your chance to be a hero kid

   joe fromm knew it was childish of
him to be excited he tried not to look
interested yeah  he said

   yeah what happens now is we get
there and code in that the situation is as
reported then the brass has a confer-
ence and they decide somebody has got
to investigate so they ask for volun-
teers were the laddies on the spot the
other boys are all on stand-by according-
to this	

   he waved the orders tape at fromm
who caught it and read it through care-
fully

   and if we were on stand-by instead
of proceed you know what wed be
doing right now  the sergeant went on
enjoying his own discomfort as loudly
as possible ill tell you what wed be
standing all right right smack where we
were when the tape came in not one
second closer

   stand-by is supposed to mean that
you get into the best position for ob-
servation the pfc recited

   sure the best position for observa-
tion kid is in-scan and out of blowup
range so you take ypur choice you
stay where you are when the tape comes
in or you back out as far as you can and
stay in-scan anyhow were the boys
on the spot see theyre going to want
a volunteer to board the beebee and i
got a hunch he finished with a faint
note of hope that i might come out of
this in one piece just on account of you

at full speed toward the trapped bb
acting on normal emergency procedures
when the keys taped out the order from
commander hartson on phobos post to
do just that no stars showed on the
viewer they had stopped the rotation
of the scanner and the screen held a
steady picture of the three scanlite sta-
tions with a fuzzy hump in the center

   could be fromm said nonchalantly
youre senior after all its your privi-
lege

   he was delighted that he managed to
keep a poker face through the statement

joe fromm stepped out of the air-
lock into space and let himself float
free orienting for a slow count of five
whoever you are	

he had done it a hundred times and
more in drill but it felt different now
as in the drill he made a routine extra
check of his equipment tank jetter
axe welder magnograpple mechitape
recorder no radio in an insul-suitj
knife gun signal mirror medikit all
ok

   he set the jet at gentie and squirted
off toward the glowing ball of force that
held the starscout two more squirts
and he was as close as he could get he
flashed the mirror twice at bolster in
the scanliter to start the passageway
in the sphere opening this was the last
contact till he came out again if her

  if i come out again  he thought
the whole phrase through deliberately
and was surprised at the way his mind
accepted the possibility and dismissed
it he felt tremendously alive almost
as if each separate cell was tingling with
some special vigor and awareness and
in the center of it all in some hidden
part of himself he was dead calm al-
most amused was this what they called
courage

   he flashed the mirror again bolster
was certainly taking his time all he had
to do was throw a switch fromm began
flashing angry code with the mirror and
kept it up knowing bolster couldnt an-
swer and rejoicing in the knowledge
until he saw the opening appear in the
ball of force and begin to expand

  then he realized it wasnt simply
throwing a switch once the passage-
way-mechanism was put into operation
it had to keep going on its own opening
and closing at intervals so as to permit
him egress and still not let enough
e-m-g through in either direction to
disturb the power-stasis inside it took
only a little bit of computer work   
but quite a bit more intricate checking
of the relays to make certain the auto-
matics would not fail

  he had to hold himself back to keep
from diving through as soon as the hole
was as big as his suit but he waited
as he had been trained to do until it
stuped enlarging the computer knew

better than he did how much space he
needed

  then he squirted forward and
through the bb looked strange hang-
ing there in the middle of nothing with
an air of polite impatience waiting to
finish its passage into the system

  joe grinned and duly spoke his
thought out loud for the record every
single thing that passes through your
head theyd said over and over again
in school when youre on any kind of
solo operation you want to be sure the
guy who takes over knows everything
you did no matter how crazy it seems
an idea that doesnt connect for you
could make sense to him

  so joe fromm told the mechitape at-
tachment on his suit that the starscout
looked impatient he kept talking de-
scribing his actions and thoughts and
emotions as he approached the ship
cautiously and opened the outer lock
door more waiting and he informed the
tape that the air lock was in operating
condition

   then he was in the ship and omitted
to mention in his running commentary
that he was scared silly down the cor-
ridor   open the cabin doors one at a
time    empty empty    not empty
go on in joe hes out cold couldnt
hurt a fly

   one of the aliens is in this cabin
this is the third door i have opened
second cabin to the right going down
the corridor from the lock to control 
hc-s either dead or unconscious  hope
theyre all like that  hes big  hope
theyre not all like that maybe ten feet
tall sort of curled up on the bunk might
have been asleep might still be might
wake up

   he gulped and decided hed better put
it on record might still   no that
was foolish these characters had reg-
istered em radiations on the instru-
ments in the stations they couldnt stay
conscious inside the emg field without
insul-suits anything strong enough to
stop a bb in its tracks would stop a man
too
	startling stories

  but its not a man its  its defi-
ditely humanoid  hard to believe any
alien creatures could evolve so much like
humans no tenacles nothing like that
arms and hands look like ours    fin-
gers too hes wearing some kind of
robe   hard to get it loose with these
gloves on cant see the legs for sure but
the arms are human all right face is
different something funny about the
mouth sort of pursed-up-looking
closed cant see the inside    guess i
can try and open it no later maybe
i better take a look around anyhow
this guy is a lot like you and me only
almost twice as big not very hairy
dark skin big black eyes    how can
anything thats not human have eyes
that look at you like that even when
hes out cold i dont know    going
out now next cabin second door on the
left

  heres another one  on the floor
this time kind of crumpled up  must
have been standing when the field hit
and fell down nothing new here   
wait a minute this fella must have cut
his hand on something when he fell 
yeah theres an open locker door with
an edge blood is dried looks like its a
lot darker than ours but its crazy how
human it looks anyhow    going out
again now  in the corridor no more
doors here 

  there were two more of them in the
control room one strapped in the pilots
seat squeezed in really he just about
could make it the other was slumped
over the solar analog computer

  looks like he was checking the land-
ing data fromm reported these
guys sure were confident two of em
off shift when they were coming in and
everything set for a normal landing
didnt they figure on any trouble at all 
they should have realized they couldnt
just sit down on one of our planets
hell they knew about the web they
gave the code-dope straight and they
decelerated to approach and had the
correct angle  i dont get it  here
goes once around the room now i will

check all instruments

  starting from the door and turning
right star-chart microviewer intact
and operating films filed properly i
think wont take time to check them all
now but they look right radio desk
appears in normal condition for use
cant test space suit locker is full of
strange stuff will come back to examine
 analog comps come next this guy is
sprawled all over them  

   he followed his nose around the cylin-
drical room till he came back to the door
again everything was or seemed to be
in good working order a few adjust-
ments had been made in levers and hand-
holds to fit the aliens larger hands
otherwise virtually nothing had been
touched except for normal use

  okay i guess i better start on the
locker now   but he didnt want to
he felt suddenly tired not scared any
more    maybe that was it now he
knew he was safe and there werent any
booby traps or anything seriously wrong
he was feeling the strain let bolster
do some work too he thought angrily
and almost said it out loud for the tape
then he realized that his sudden pique
was really just weariness and at the
same time he became acutely aware of
hunger and an even more pressing bio-
logical urge time to go home joe
always leave the party early thats how
to stay popular

   he ought at least to get the robe off
one of the creatures first and make sure
about their anatomy but he had an odd
reluctance to do it they were too human
 it seemed as if it wasnt fair some-
how to go poking around under their
clothes

  hell let bolster do it he left the
ship

ill

lone in the scanliter joe fromm
played his mechitape into the permanent
recorder and turned up the volume so
he could hear it himself and get every-
thing clear for his report to phobos
                     whoever
borne of the stuff sounded crazy but he
could tell what part was fact and what
was just his own imagination he
chewed on a pencil end and occasionally
noted down something he should be sure
to remember

   altogether composing the report was
more painful than visiting the ship had
been he had just started putting it onto
the transmitter when he saw the indi-
cator for the outer lock light up bolster
sure hadnt stayed on that ship long
he felt better now about coming back
himself

   the sergeant came inside shedding
his insul-suit and bursting with excite-
ment

   you should of looked in that locker
kid he was triumphant anyway
its a good thing for me you didnt this
is the kind of good luck bonuses are
made of he removed an envelope care-
fully from the storage pocket on the out-
side of the suit got your stuff in yet

i want to shoot this to them fast

   i just started  fromm said
well well flash this and you can
finish up afterwards

   he handed the envelope to the younger
man and started climbing out of the leg
pieces of the suit go on read it man
fromm opened the flap and unfolded
a piece of official service stationary to
whom it may concern it said on ton nd
then right underneath to the staff offi-
cers of solar defense

  the other men have asked me to
write this message and i guess i can
do it all right but im afraid ill have
to be pretty informed ive tried to write
it up in military report style only its
just not the kind of thing that service
language fits

	for one thing the very first line of
the report form stopped me because we
dont know where we are only the cap-
tain knew our orders and hes dead now
and we couldnt find his log or any of
his papers anywhere in the ship

   weve set a course for the big fellas
 by backtracking on the analog comps
 that means it will take them almost as

you are	n

 long to get back as it took us to get there
 but thats just as well because it will
 bring them in about the time our tour is
 due up and maybe thatll make it easier
 for them to get in

  weve done our best to explain to
them all the dangers involved-not being
sure of the course even and being pretty
sure you folks wont let them through
but we cant talk to them as easy as they
talk to us we can get over general
ideas all right and any kind of thought
that has a solid object nearby to attach
to but the idea of people of humans
that is not wanting to let them into the
system-well even if we talked the same
language    that is if they talked a
language at all that we could learn   i
dont think they could understand that
idea

  im not going to try to tell you
anything about them because if they get
far enough to show you this they can
explain everything themselves this
message is just to let you know that the
four of us are here safe and sound and
staying behind of our own free will
since captain malcolms suicide theres
nobody to order us home and we like it
here besides there isnt room enough
in the bb for more than five people-
humans i mean-or four of them they
need more food and they want to send
four along on the trip i think they
picked out their leading scientists in
different fields so they can get as much
information as possible and be able to
answer your questions

  i dont know probably a psychofficer
or some of our scientists will be able to
communicate better with them on this
kind of thing we get along fine for
everyday purposes but you see im not
even sure what kind of scientists theyre
sending

  the only thing the others and i are
sure of and thats what this message is
for is that you can trust these big fellas
up to the limit theyve treated us fine
and they    well its a funny way to
put it but like isnt strong enough
   they just seem to love everybody
startling stories

 

humans as well as their own kind

  we will wait here for further orders
you can probably figure out where we
are from the analog comp records

ut did a tour of duty with jim mal-
colm once the commander said
slowly he was a pretty good guy i
liked him its hard to think of him com-
mitting suicide i wish this gentile had
been a little more specific

  lucille ardin public relations depu-
ty at phobos post skimmed the message
tape rapidy and passed it along to the
psychofficer she cocked one feathery
eyebrow cynically these boys just
dont make sense she said theyve
been sold something all right    but
what 

  the commander sh ok his head wait-
ing for dr schwartz to finish reading
well bob he said af soon as the
psychofficer looked up what do you
think

  id like to see that log schwartz
said thoughtfully

  so would i commander william
hartson had earned his position as as-
sistant chief of staff for solar defense
he was that rare thing an officer ad-
mired equally by the general public and
by the men who worked under him at
sixty-eight years of age he was still in
the prime of health and vitality-but old
enough to have seen his fill of violence
danger and death he was indecisive in
action but a decision involving the lives
of others would be made with care

  bob schwartz had worked with hart-
son long enough to understand these
things this captain    he asked
malcolm would you say he was   
well a fairly typical line officer

  the commander permitted himself a
faint smile trying to figure the mili-
tary mind again bob as a matter of

fact i think jim malcolm is-was one
of the few officers whod fit your pic-
ture pretty well courage devotion pre-
cision-a stubborn sob who went by
the rule book himself and figured every-
body else could do at least as much  
but the kind whod lay down his life for
his service without thinking twice its
just suicide that doesnt make sense

  hartsons voice broke off and for a
moment the only sound in the room was
the shuffling of paper schwartz still
held the message tape running it
through his fingers as if the feel of it
would somehow help him to understand
its meaning better lucy ardin pushed
away the pad on which shed been scrib-
bling hartsons explanation of the force-
sphere that was holding the bb- cap-
tive and its alien crew unconscious

  god what a story she whispered
reverently into the silence she ground
out a half-smoked cigarette in the com-
manders big ash-tray and stood up
the silver-sequinned dinner gown in
which shed answered the alarm glit-
tered painfully under the overhead light
it was entirely typical of lucy that
when the call-bell rang in her bedroom
she had pushed back the stool from her
dressing table without taking even the
extra instants time to complete the
slash of crimson on her lips then pick-
ing up the portfolio that was always
ready for use she had arrived at the
exec office with the lipsticking finished
en route within seconds after the two
men who lived on the post

  all right she said briskly what
happens nowr we stitch up some six-
tentacled strait-jackets and make our
visitors nice and safe then we take the
field off and haul em down where to
what do we do with them afterwards 
who gets to interview them 

  the psychofficer looked up sharply
and hartson chuckled relax bob im
afraid its our baby all the way down the
line i wish i was looking forward to it
like you two are i have a hunch it may
turn out to be something of a mess  
the aliens by the way are humanoid
whoever you are	

miss ardin perhaps youd like to see
the tape again i believe theres a de-
tailed description    hey bob youre
done with it arent you 

  sorry schwartz handed it to the
girl and snapped out of his abstracted
mood is it safe to leave them in the
stasis a little longer bill he asked

  cant say for sure with humans
twelve hours doesnt do any harm these
fellas may be dead already for all we
know best we can do is assume thev
react like us

  it seems to me that log must be some-
where on the ship the psychofiicer said
if theres time i think it might be a
good idea to try and find it-before we
decide anything a man like malcolm
would have made sure the papers were
safe if he had any way to do it at all
youre right hartson too came
up from his reflections and sprang into
action youre damned right if its
there we can find it and if we cant-
well thats an answer too

joe fromm went back to the bb-
with two other men from the stand-in
scanliters that had now been ordered up
to assist between them they searched
the byrd from nose to nozzles and be-
hind a panel in the electrical repair
cabinet they found the ships papers
charts orders and the missing log

  fromm took time to open the log and
look at the last page he hardly had to
struggle with his conscience at all over
it under the dateline in neat typing it
said

  carlsen should have been back an
hour ago under the circumstances that
means theyve got him too my error
was in not leaving after i talked to tsin
last week three of us could have
brought the ship back alone i dont
believe i can do it

  i have considered taking off anyhow
simply in order to make certain the
natives do not gain any further knowl-
edge of the ship my only chores now

are betrayal or self-destruction and be-
tween these two i am afraid i have no
real choice i must therefore pick the
most effective means of suicide and
after giving the matter careful thought
have determined that a systematic de-
struction of the control room is a wiser
procedure than the complete removal of
the ship from the planet

  by following this course of action i
can at least hope that a future expedi-
tion or perhaps even a rescue-ship will
find this log and understand the danger
here

  this evening i shall have my last
supper in style tomorrow i shall finish
the dismantling of the controls and hide
this book together with the more im-
portant of the ships papers    and
may god have mercy on my soul
below that in almost equally neat
and legible a script were two para-
graphs

  once more i have delayed too long
gentile my firstclassman is at the outer
lock now and he has three of the natives
with him apparently they now have
him sufficiently under control so that he
will do for them what they have not
dared to do for themselves they are
coming into the ship

  i expect they are coming for me and
i cannot risk exposing myself to their
control i know too much that they can
use the work of dismantling the con-
trols is barely started im afraid the en-
listed men can still repair it readily but
none of them after all even know where
we are the star-charts and orders will
be hidden with this log i can only hope
the papers remain hidden until the right
people come to find them

  underneath there was a careful signa-
ture james malcolm captain solar
byrd service in command baby bird
iii and in parenthesis below that oner
word of macabre humor deceased
they ordered scanliter six down to
phobos post to bring in the papers of
the bb- there was too much material
to transmit by radio

  bolster grinned and slapped his pfc
t	startling stories

on the back were both a couple of
bloomin heroes he said just the kind
of a hero i like to be some other guysll
be around when they decide to blast that
baby and you and me can watch it all
from the post

   blast it joe looked up from the log
holding his finger in the page youre
kidding why would they 

  brother you got the reason wrapped
around your finger one look at that and
theyll blow those babies clear back to
where they came from you can take a
chance on a guy who fights fair but
these fellas-

  how do you know theyre fighting
us fromm demanded you saw the
byrdmans note the one you brought
in   this guy malcolm was off his
rocker

   well ill buy that one too you cant
tell with the brass when they get an
idea in their heads but look kid you
gotta grow up some that note i
brought in-its pretty easy to get a guy
to write something like that if you got
him hypnotized to start with and youre
twice his size anyhow-not to mention
there being a whole planetful of your
kind and only four of his i can tell you
anyhow thats how the brassll see it
solar defense doesnt take chances

  did you read what it says here
fromm insisted the part where mal-
colm tells about talking to tsin it just
doesnt make sense to take it the way he
did he was space-happy thats all the
commander isnt going to swallow this
stuff

   you wait and see the sergeant said
again and when you do youre gonna
be awful glad youre down there instead
of here

  i    look i know this sounds
crazy   fromm put the log down
finally and blurted out the rest of it
id like to stick around if anybody
goes back out there i want a chance to
take another look at those guys you
think you could take somebody from
one of the other ships down with you
and leave me here

  it not only sounds crazy bolster
said it is crazy but its your body son
you want to stick around you can bet
nobody else does he shook his head
uncomprehendingly and began punching
but a message to scanliter twelve
where chan lai would jump at the
chance to change spots with his weak-
witted pfc

t ordered him to return to ship
immediately he refused his exact
words insofar as i recall them were
captain i wish i could do as you desire
me to-or even better that i could con-
vince you to come with me and visit
our friends they are our friends if
you would give them a chance to talk
with you i think you might understand
better it is hard to explain with just
words but i simply cannot go back now
emphasis is mine    jm you are a
married man sir perhaps i might feel
differently if there were some love wait-
ing for me at home too but i am young
and not yet married and  

   i broke in here thinking that i might
be able to use persuasion where author-
ity had failed i pointed out that there
was very little likelihood he would ever
be married if i decided to take up the
ship abandoning him and gentile on
the planet-as of course i have every
right to do in view of their outright in-
subordination the natives here for all
their startlingly humanoid appearance
are twice our size and are almost cer-
tainly not suitable for breeding from a
purely biologic viewpoint

  he replied quite earnestly that he
hoped i would not take that drastic
step   that he did not wish to remain
permanently among the natives but that
he felt he had to stay long enough to
become fully acquainted with them and
with their way of life and to be healed
of all the hurts and scars of a lifetime
in the system

  the conversation went on for some
time but the parts i have already re-
corded contain the gist of it there was
one thing tsin said however that i
whoever you are	

feel should be included here along with
the train of thought that followed it if
anything should happen to me or to my
ship i suspect it will in some way be
connected with my low susceptibility to
the emotional point he seemed to be try-
ing to make

  tsin reminded me during the con-
versation of a story i have always con-
sidered rather bathotic that of the little
orphan girl in the days before the crech-
es who threw a note over the high wall
of the orphanage saying whoever you
are i love you

  this anecdote i gathered was sup-
posed to define for me the nature of the
emotional healing he was receiving at
the hands-or i suppose i should say the
minds-of the natives

   this particular bit of bathos has been
annoying me for years i have had the
story related to me at least three times
previously always to illustrate some
similarly obscure emotional point and
i have always wondered afterwards what
the end of the story might have been

  now it seems very important to be
able to foresee the results of the childs
action what happened when the note
was picked up and read and why did
the child write it 

   it is this last question i think that
oothers me the most a sentimentalist
might answer that she meant it but i
find this unlikely at best i believe she
neant that she hoped whoever found it
pould love her and that is the very best
nterpretation i can put on it it seems
fven more likely that her motive was
fven more specific if she threw such a
billet doux over the wall regularly i
ihould think eventually one of the sen-
dmentalists would have found it made
tome response and provided the means
for her to get over the orphanage wall
into the world outside

   the natives here have a fairly highly-
ileveloped technology and quite obvious-
ly a very highly-developed psychology or
mental science of some sort they are
telepaths after all and they have taken
no pains to conceal from us their interest

in acquiring a means of space travel

   there is nothing to pin down no way
to make certain of their real attitudes
toward us they have greeted us warm-
ly and have done nothing to indicate any
hostility or to harm us in any way-
nothing but walk off with two of my crew
in an apparently friendly fashion

   perhaps the wisest course of action
would be to leave now while i still have
two men on board but it is a hard deci-
sion to make-to maroon two of my men
on an alien planet

   if i believed for a moment that gen-
tile and tsin are responsible for their
own actions i should not hesitate to
make that decision but their behavior
is so entirely out of character that i
can see no explanation except that the
are acting under some form of hypnotk
control as i see it my duty is to make
every effort including main force to re-
turn them to the ship before i leave

v

 artson read it for the fourth
time and slapped the typescript down on
the desk i   hell jim malcolm was a
friend of mine how can i tell it sounds
like him    sure it sounds like every
report he ever wrote except where it
sounds like him being pie-eyed in a bull-
session

   he sat down and let the blank bewil-
derment he felt show in his eyes as he
faced the psychofficer well what do
you say i cant decide this one by my-
self

   courtesy turned him halfway through
the question to face the pr chief on the
other side of the desk courtesy and
common sense both officially lucys
job was just to get out the news-or to
keep it in as seemed wisest the catch
was in that last phrase in practice she
was both public censor and interpreter-
at-large for the post and her civil serv-
ice appointment made her the only au-
thority on phobos who was independent
of the service

the commander had been dealing with
	startling stories

  the pr bureau long enough so that in
  six months at the post lucy had never
  yet had any cause to remove her velvet
  glove it was easy to forget sometimes
  about the iron beneath it one might
  almost think that she forgot herself

    ill check to doctor schwartz she
  demurred now

    schwartz managed a smile will you
  please stop being polite he asked
  youve got an opinion lets hear it
  she hesitated and he added i dont
  even like what im thinking i better
  think it a little more before i say it

    all right her voice was controlled
  but her eyes gleamed with excitement
  she was talking at schwartz almost
  ignoring the commander i think these
  fellas have the biggest thing since e-m-g
  its the one thing we havent been able
  to crack at all you know it as well as i
  do theyve got the unbeatable weapon
  -the psychological weapon you cant
  fight em because you dont want to
  people call modern pr mass hypnotism
  but the techniques weve got are childs
  play compared to what those guvs can
  do theyve got the real thing the
  question is can we get it away from
  them has psych section got any way
  of handling something this hot

    i take it hartson put in drily that
  you are convinced of the accuracy of
  captain malcolms interpretation of the
  events 

    she looked puzzled why    yes
  how else can you explain it has there
  ever been a case of desertion like that
  before 

    never he said crisply and turned to
  the psychofficer again all right bob
  youve had some time now say your
  piece

   let me start this way schwartz
 said hesitantly  think lucy is right
 in one respect anyway  what theyve
 got is an irresistible weapon if it is a
 weapon but to accept that idea wed
 have to presuppose the existence of a
 war or at least hostility between them
 and us theres a verse thats been
 running through my head for the last

hour im sorry bill to be so round-
about just try to put up with me a
few minutes will youi cant quite re-
member the whole thing but its about
an enemy who drew a circle to keep
me out then theres a line i remember
clearly but love and i knew better we
drew a circle to bring him in you see
what im driving at certainly our basic
attitude toward any alien is potentially
hostile they are guilty until proven
innocent

  weve been all over that ground
bob hartson broke in i know your
opinion and you ought to know mine
by now i dont like it either but its the
reason why we have been consistently
successful in such contacts
consistently victorious id say all
right lets just put it that i am emotion-
ally more inclined to accept gentiles at-
titude than malcolms i see no evidence
to support the view that these people
are using a hypnotic weapon it is at
least as likely that the feeling they pro-
jected at our men was honest and uncal-
culated why not assume for a moment
that the occupants of that ship really are
four of their leading scientists sent here
to exchange knowledge with us
youve got a point there lucy ar-
din said unexpectedly an act of ag-
gression against these four could make
trouble if they were on the level to start
with i think it gets down to a good old-
fashioned problem in shielding has
psych section got any way of handling
these boys if we bring them in doc

  he considered for a moment

  that depends weve got anti-hyp-
notics and weve got personnel specially
trained against susceptibility to hyp-
nosis but the beebee had the same
drugs and should have had some trained
personnel too theres a point bill id
like to see the basic psych ratings on all
five of those men if you can get em es-
pecially malcolms i could get the pa-
pers myself he added smiling weakly
through channels it wouldnt take
more than three or four weeks can you
get em fast
whoever

t can try hartson jumped at the
chance for concrete action he rang
for an aide and scribbled an order to
records in his own handwriting put
this on the facscan he said briskly and
give it a top-rush priority i think i see
what youre getting at bob he said as
the door closed behind the uniformed
girl i remember i was kind of sur-
prised myself when i heard jim had gone
into the byrd service couldnt imagine
him going outside voluntarily he was
an earthman all the way through why
he didnt even believe marsmen were
really human is that what you wanted
to know 

  part of it that much was pretty
clear in his report i want to know the
comparative resistance of the crew mem-
bers to hypnosis and what the other
mens attitudes were toward alien life-
things like that

  i thought all byrdmen had to pass
standardized tests for that the pr
chief said just a little sharply

  they do at least the enlisted men
do but theres still a range of individual
variation and officers    well they
have a tough time getting enough men
to command the beebees i think just
about any regular line officer who volun-
teered would pass the test   

  he looked to hartson for confirma-
tion and got a reluctant nod then he
went on even with the men it depends
where they took their tests thatll show
on the papers psych section isnt too-
efficient-in some spots

  ill bear that in mind lucy said
tautly but id still like to know just
how much psych section right here is
equipped to do you say youve got the
drugs and the personnel doctor all
right then if the commander brings
these fellows in alive can you handle
them  if you cant she shrugged

  that depends the psychofficer de-
clined the challenge of her tone and went
on deliberately we can handle it all
right if its as simple a thing as hyp-
nosis it happens that i dont believe
captain malcolm was right about that

you are	

i can tell better after i see his psych
ratings  

  all right then i take it were going
to sit around here for the next few hours
waiting to see what the tests say that
gives you a little more time to make up
your mind well if im going to spend
the night here id like to be a little more
comfortable do you mind if i run home
for a change of clothes while were wait-
ing commander

  hartson eyed the shimmering stiffness
of her dinner gown unhappily im sor-
ry miss ardin i hope youll understand
this qualifies as a major policy decision
and im afraid ill have to ask you not to
leave until we are finished with whatever
we decide

  she shrugged again and sat down
could i have a typer then  i could be
getting some of my story into shape
schwartz laughed from the vantage
point of the smoking jacket and carpet
slippers in which hed answered the
emergency call he said easily bill
couldnt you order something from sup-
ply for the lady si coveralls or some-
thing like that it might make a differ-
ence in our decision if she could be more
comfortable

  i can do that hartson said shortly
and of course you may have any equip-
ment you wish miss ardin

  thank you commander she said
too sweetly im sure it will help i won-
der if perhaps we could facilitate matters
by sending for the doctors uniform too
if im to be made more flexible i suspect
a change of clothes might make him
more decisive

  hartson grinned shes got a point
there bob he said mildly

  all right the psychofficer stood up
abruptly paced the length of the small
room and wheeled to facethem all
right ill tell you what  think i think
the human race is too damn scared and
too damn hungry to be able to face this
thing hungry for security for reassur-
ance for comfort-for love and scared
scared of anything different anything
outside anything one degree more in-
	startling stories

tense than the rules allow

  also-pardon my bluntness bill-i
think captain malcolms reaction was
typical of all thats sickest in our sys-
tem the very fact that we are seriously
sitting here considering how much of a
menace these four individuals represent
-four humanoid beings who come
armed with nothing but a message of
love that very fact-that we sit and
stew over it i mean-makes them dan-
gerous

  you want to know what i think i
think what theyve got-whether its a
weapon or a natural way of life whether
its hypnotism or open-hearted honesty
or anything else is-not unbeatable not
ultimate not any of the other adjectives
thatve been thrown around here tonight
but specifically irresistible

  i think all of us-you bill wanting
to do the blameless thing-and you
suffering through hours of torment in
those ridiculous clothes because theyre
supposed to make you attractive-and
maybe me most of all hating to say what
i know because its brutal-all of us and
the rest of the system too have one cry-
ing need that the lousy culture weve
made for ourselves cant possibly fulfill

  we want love we need love every
poor blessed damned soul among us and
we need it so much it can be used as a
weapon against us

  understand please just because its
important to me to have it on the record
that i dont for a moment believe its
hypnotism theyre using i think they
mean it but

  well at last lucy ardin sighed
and moved a tense finger for the first
time since hed started talking then
you think you can handle it

vi

schwartz stared at her in amaze-
ment didnt you hear anything i
said  no no i dont think i can handle
it or that anybody else can i dont be-
lieve its hypnosis but i cant see that
that matters or rather i might feel

more at ease about it if i could believe
that

  damn it bill i hate this i want you
to understand clearly that the advice i
am giving you is against my own inclin-
ations and instincts now look if it is to
be regarded as a weapon-and i see no
other way we may regard it from the
point of view of solar defense-then it
is irresistible there is no way to tie or
bind the minds of these-people-except
by keeping them unconscious which
would automatically defeat any purpose
of investigation  

  he picked up his copy of the summary
and excerpts from the log riffled
through the pages and threw it down
again sadly bill id give all my rat-
ings and ten years off my life for the
chance to talk to those guys myself and
find out    but my advice as an officer
of solar defense is that we have no
choice but to destroy the aliens before
they regain consciousness

  both the others were on their feet as
he finished

  god damn it bob hartson shouted
you cant just 

  dont you see lucy ardins crisp
voice cut in all hes saying is he
doesnt know none of us know and i
want to find out im not scared of it
maybe you need love that bad psych-
officer but i dont she sat down again
triumphant and breathless

  the commander ignored her is that
your last word bob shall i take that
as your decision 

  im afraid so bill you heard lucy
just now remember what malcolm was
wondering about the end of the story of
the little orphan girl thats one an-
swer in terms of the little girl it would
mean that whoever found the note
took it back inside and told the authori-
ties that one of their children was writ-
ing dirty notes-so the kid could be in-
vestigated thats just one ending there
are lots of others but dont forget the-
one he was afraid of dont forget all the
sentimentalists-like me for instance
if i were to forget my duty as an officer
whoever

of the service i would want nothing
more than to get the little girl out of the
orphanage just so she could love them

  and dont forget either that there
would be any number of different an-
swers besides and that everyone would
feel strongly about his own solution
you have your choice commander you
can destroy them in the name of security
and safety-or you can risk a system-
wide civil war and total conquest by an
alien race whatll you have
commander hartson smiled wryly
ill take vanilla he said distinctly and
rang for an aide the uniformed girl ap-
peared in the doorway jenny he said
i want orders typed up for countersign-
ing to arrange all details for the moving
of the baby byrd iii to deimos isolation
post immediately the ship will be pilot-
ed by pfc joseph fromm now aboard
the scanliter twelve we will want a
continuous radio report from the pilot
starting with his entry into the ship

  separate orders are to go to scan-
liters seventeen and twenty-two to fol-
low the bb- in with all artillery on the
ready they are to maintain radio si-
lence with vocal reception open private
fromm is to know nothing of the ready-
fire orders the word apple will be the
signal to fire if i decide it is necessary
to destroy the ship is that all clear
yes sir

  the door closed quietly behind her
and bob schwartz stood up and walked
around the desk to shake the command-
ers hand

  they say youre a great man bill he
said quietly im beginning to think
you are now id like to ask a favor im
not entitled to i did my duty as i saw
it and gave you my advice as an officer
of the sd now im asking for a privi-
lege as an old friend if youre going to
try bringing that ship in id like to be
aboard her on the way i want to be
there when they come to im a qualified
observer and it shouldnt take more than
an hour to get me up there it wont be
much of a delay

  the commanders voice was icy i

you are		

think you know thats impossible bob
certainly youre qualified-too qualified
we have to have a man on that ship but
we only need one man and he has to be
expendable the only qualifications he
needs are to know how to pilot the ship
and to be able to talk continuously we
already have a volunteer for the job and
hes acceptable if you want to give him
any instructions about what to look for
or what to talk about you have five min-
utes to prepare them after that the
action will start you understand i am
taking your advice but i feel i must
first prove to myself that your premises
are correct i want to see just how irre-
sistible they are

  he turned to the pr chief and went
on as coldly you are free to leave now
miss ardin youll want to hear the re-
ports as they come in i imagine it
should be about twenty minutes before
the ship is actually under way

fc joe fromm walked through the
inner airlock into the bb- climbed
out of his space suit and made a quick
examination of the cabins three of the
aliens still unconscious were bound an-
kle to ankle and wrist to wrist on the
floor of one cabin that door was to be
locked the other cabin was empty as it
was supposed to be

  cabins okay as planned he mut-
tered into the mouthpiece strapped to
his chest corridor and cabinets clear
he entered the control room and tested
the manacles restraining the outside
limbs of the alien who had formerly oc-
cupied the pilots seat and was now se-
cured in a specially built chair alien in
control room unconscious and id say
pretty safe the way hes tied down in-
strument check electronic controls
okay radar okay rocket controls   

  he went down the list cheerful with
the familiar routine talking easily un-
troubled by the need for extra breaths
between words that had plagued his in-
spection of the aliens

  i am now strapping myself into the
pilot-seat and preparing for takeoff
		startling stories

ready to leave as soon as i am signaled
free   signal received blasting off now
 utilizing minimum acceleration com-
ing in at deimos on direct approach   
the fella in the control room here seems
to be wiggling his toes   you wouldnt
think theyd have toes just like us would
you     hes coming to all right  i
am on direct course to deimos at min-axe
still  i think maybe everythingll
work out okay 

  he had to watch the instruments with
one eye and the alien with the other the
-whatever he was-didnt seem to be
trying to bust loose at all

  hes moving his head now and look-
ing around   looking at his handcuffs
and the chair trying to turn his head
around to see where his legs are cuffed
underneath but he isnt strugglingat all
 looking me over now  i caught his
eye for a minute just then or he caught
mine i think he wants me to look at him
again but ill try not to he has to be
able to fasten my attention on something
to hypnotize me dosent he  i am mov-
ing my eyes around checking instru-
ments and thinking as many different
thoughts as i can 

  we are now approaching an orbit
around mars decelerating my radar
screen shows too scanliters following us
   should they be so close inside range
in case it is necessary to fire on us  
please dont  thats not my thought

   it    hes thinking at me    they
are telepaths all right he doesnt seem
to i dont know the first thought i was
sure wasnt mine was please dont fire
on us we are friends it seemed so nat-
ural i started to say it his thoughts
arent in clear words now  i heard
once that to receive stuff like this you
have to not concentrate    something
like that maybe im trying too hard 
no im too tense    that was his
thought not mine he was telling me not
to be so tense and id understand   

  he says-you can call it says its
enough like talking-he says theyre
friends they like us they want to be
friends he keeps saying it different

ways but its the same feeling all the
time with different-pictures i guess to
go with it

  pictures hey stay out of there

  he wants me to  to love him
thats what he says he  men dont
feel that way about each other  no

 loves me he loves all-not men some
kind of thought for his own people and
all-living creatures-those are on his
home planet he loves all men this time
he means men

  that was silly of me   he wasnt
being nasty  he just meant love   
that picture was mine 

  he says the pictures i get for mean-
ings are all my own so i might get his
meaning wrong sometimes he makes a
picture in his mind the way hed visual-
ize a thought on his world but i see it the
way it would be on mine 

  listen captain malcolm just didnt
understand this is importantj   they -
dont mean the kind of thing we do when 
they say love they mean liking and
sharing and  we havent got the right
words for it but its all right its not a
grabby feeling or taking anything or
hurting anybody theres nothing to be
afraid of the only thing that captain
got right was that story about the
kid

  on phobos base lucy ardins typer
clacked eagerly while bill hartson and
bob schwartz turned from the viewer
together hartson was a soldier his face
was stern and set as he reached for the
mike the only emotion he showed was
the single flash from his eyes to his
friends when he looked at schwartz and
saw the tears of frustration rolling un-
ashamed down the psychofficers face

     the one who threw the note over
the wall that is the way they feel hes
telling me now to tell all of you hes
agreeing he says i understand now
its the way human beings love when
theyre kids like the note the girl wrote
whoever you are  

  the commander spoke one word ap-
ple

       i love you

 there are more ways to conquer a world than hy fighting for it

it was the th year after the great
famine but the keeper of things
found was hungry he straightened his
thin shoulders and tried to stop shiver-
ing as he passed between the soldiers at
the entrance soldiers werent the only
people important to the tyrant they
got the heaviest skins and the most food
but the keeper of things found was
important too he could read and was
excused from fighting this wasfor-
tunate because of the increasing pain
surrounding the lump in his chest

  the soldiers remained silent fearful
of the man passing between them
everything found in the ruins had to
be turned over to him by order of the
tyrant little enough was found
every man had heard from generations

  back of the mysterious death that lurked
  in the ruins only fools and demons
  went near the ruins now

    well the tyrant stood spraddle-
 legged before the fire fear sawed at
 the nerves of the others who yearned
 but dared not move closer to the warm
 flames

    this book was brought in by a sol-
 dier the keeper forced his voice to be
 firm because this was so important he
 had to take shelter during a battle with
 the hill people in a ruin his goatskin
 caught on the knob of a big metal box
 when he jerked it free the door of the
 box opened this frightened him be-
 cause the box was battered as if he re-
 peated poundings had not opened it----

   the tyrant kicked a burning log

	startling stories

read it

  it is called the diary of coronado
gomez the words came fast lest the
tyrant refuse to listen the numbers
 appear below the name  

   not all of it a page here one there
   the keeper swallowed and began

  	page 

  last night i am wakened from a
sound sleep by pedros shouts gen-
eral general he calls with terrified
urgency the atomic war without
warning it is here he is shaking a
tassel of teletype streamers at me
look general what will we do
panic w-ill break in the streets

  i brush the papers from under my
nose pedro tries to speak more coher-
ently during the night he says an
atomic war began between america and
russia each country accuses the other
of dropping the first bomb making the
initial attack

  all right pedro all right i say
patiently let a day or two pass before
this appears in the press his mouth
drops in awe of my calm no need to
spoil our fiesta

  but surely general he sputters
with face as white as the mushrooming
atomic clouds he sees in his mind you
cannot keep this quiet

pedro thinks only of mushrooming
clouds he forgets how his atomic
knowledge has rid me of the treacherous
lump growing in my side the news
will get about pedro but slowly the
borders are closed you will speak to
radio and communications people
pedro stares at me his whiskers
trembling i laugh who is he to under-
stand radio-active cobalt since you
have started my day so early do not
forget the arrangement for dinner to-
night my german friends are dining
with me to celebrate the fiesta i will
wear full uniform in deference to field
marshall von streuve who is invited
along with the scientists but i am for-
getting the church i say for i cannot

resist adding to pedros troubles io-
vite father alvarez also

  pedro bows out gnawing his mus-
tache in anxiety he is wondering how
he will get father alvarez who does not
like the nazis or me to accept this
invitation

  the keeper of things found looked
up hopefully but the tryant only
scratched himself boredly the keeper
quickly turned the pages

page 

  my guests arrive-all but father al-
varez who sends his regrets when we
are settled comfortably i read aloud
the confidential war bulletins i shake
my head with much concern this is
indeed a tragedy every country is
rushing into the war on the side of the
americans or the russians even some
of our closest neighbors are offering
bases and supplies

  i must pronounce a policy of
strictest neutrality i say russia and
america each accuse the other of mak-
ing the initial attack i appeal to my
guests which am i to believe

  my guests laugh until tears are upon
their cheeks poor nazis with so few
pleasures and no fuehrer i am kind
and generous to them i offer them
asylum when they escape germany at
the time of hitlers death their grati-
tude is touching yes they will help me
train my army they will call me
fuehrer a great honoc which i refuse

i ask only that they show me how to
make scientific weapons and efficient
soldiers this pleases them they are
full of brains and pride secretly they
think coronado gomez is a crude
simple-minded peasant their arro-
gance grows in proportion to the power
of the military machine they build they
see perhaps in the fullness of time a
new german empire rising but that
is not what coronado gomez sees   

  this morning i am visited by a young
american he is greatly distraught he
wishes to return home the borders are
closed all right i tell him return
the book of the dead



home return or stay is nothing to me
either way

  but this is not all since his country
has no diplomats here he says with
some embarrassment he will deliver a
message from me to his government

  a message i ask who in wash-
ington or wherever your government
sits now cares about a message from
me

  dont you realize he cries in sur-
prise what is happening europe is

neighbors they are fighting each other
with incendiaries and explosives a
plane strafed my border patrol by mis-
take i protest everyone is careful
thereafter they do not want trouble
with coronado gomez in such a short
time my army has become the only one
in the world still intact a fine army it
is and commands proper respect noth-
ing is certain in the rest of the world but
destruction with china and india
fighting each other the asiatic prob-

in which a galactic emissary visits a science-
fiction fan and holds his head in his hand
while he makes a most interesting offer

being overrun by the russian army
london paris rome washin-the
world capitols-theyre gone    smok-
ing ruins    he runs out of breath
and manpower he gasps there is
a tremendous manpower shortage
yes too bad and i nod to him
the manpower shortage will become
worse in the end the great powers will
no longer be great still i add philo-
sophically that is the way of things
but he is more agitated than ever
we must stand together the free
world the americas cant you see
what will happen otherwise

  the question i agree courteously
is an interesting one isnt it

  he leaves in dismay americans are
so excitable

t have had little time for my journal
- of late neutrality brings with it
many details the war is now world-
wide it has made enemies among my

coming next month 

 lem of overpopulation is solving itself
 ah well   

 turn more pages snarled the ty-
 rant you love words too much

 the keeper read hastily

page 

 this afternoon i am going over esti-
 mates of my stock piles i have plenty
 to last until some sort of peace comes

 father alvarez is here pedro says
 from the doorway but the priest does
 not wait to be announced

 he strides in with his robes flowing
 and holds out some papers i have
 he begins without formality received
 notification that i will be needed tomor-
 row because of these executions

 i glance at the papers a list of
 names those of my german friends-
 all of them scientific and military too

 oh that  i pause we have
 no one of their faith here i thought
 you would not mind
	startling stories

  you acknowledge then the priest
demands your intention of murdering
these men

  now father i soothe him exe-
cution is the word execution for treas-
on they plot to kill me and set up
field marshall von streuve as their new
fuehrer

  he gazes at me silently whispering
something to himself then his voice
becomes accusing you intended all
along to murder these germans you
brought them here they trained your
peasant army they built you an atomic
bomb one atomic bomb you sent out
a plane and dropped that bomb was
it on washington or moscow it didnt
matter which did it

  father alvarez is smarter than most
men and considerably bolder

  you knew he goes on thered be
no questions asked that first atomic
bomb spelled war no matter where it
fell i am going to publish the story of
these men he slaps the execution lists
fiercely i am going to broadcast it
everywhere until the whole world knows
that you alone are responsible for this
holocaust

  i speak to him kindly after all not

he nor anyone else can stop the war
now no restraint will be placed upon
you but why do you bother soon it
will all be over-no one will be left but
us i console him i will build you a
nice little vatican of your own he
turns away and is gone a troubled
man

  he does not matter no one matters
now coronado gomez has succeeded
where caesar napoleon hitler and the
others failed coronado gomez has
made himself dictator of the world

  the tyrants voice rose this book
contains nothing you have your
orders find out how these earlier
people were able to move carts without
using oxen with such knowledge i will
annihilate the hill people i will rule
the world and his great fist sought
out the lump on the keepers chest
when i do he laughed loudly as the
blow landed therell be no more of
this senseless reading

  painfully doubled over and wishing
for death the keeper crept toward the
door but the tyrants good humor was
so contagious th two soldiers clouted
the keeper heartily and he lay still
upon the ground

by gnrdon h dickson

hey diddle diddle the cat
and the cupeiians

come come said kris ilis cheer up
meki

  i cant groaned meki ton

  have some of this pressed duck and na-
poleon brandy theres a good fella itll
make you feel better

  no thanks kris said meki hollowly
it would choke me

 the two cuperians were seated in the
palatial living room of the princess suite at
chateau hotel in miami luxury surrounded
them a feast fit for a king was laid out on
the table in front of them but they were
doing it poor justice this however was
not surprising they had been on earth for
two weeks now and the strain was telling on
them

  buried groaned meki buried alive

   
	startling stories

oh these stupid humans

  kris his looked anxiously at his
friend knitting his black brows wor-
riedly they looked remarkably alike
these two-but then cuperians always
do conforming to a general type which
is tall brunette and mongoloid in ap-
pearance-but to anyone experienced
in cuperian physiognomy it would have
been apparent immediately that kris
was the older and more responsible of
the two

  look he said soothingly why
dont you go tell it to the cat

  that stupid animal said meki bit-
terly itll never understand ive been
trying to get the situation through its
thick skull for five days now

  try again urged kris it may be
stupid but its our strongest hope right
now

  the trouble with it said meki is
that it hasnt any sense of social re-
sponsibility he sighed oh well
come here cat

 fine blue persian which had been
napping on the cloth of gold bed-
spread in the master bedroom came
strolling in through the door in response
to mekis telepathic command it saun-
tered to a position on the carpet facing
the two men and sat down

  im here said the cat kris looked
over at meki with a slight expression
of surprise

  oh youve taught it to talk he
said

  yes sighed meki i had a wild
hope that it might get to gossiping with
the bellboy or something like that but
it cant seem to grasp the concept of
talking for the pleasure of it

  oh said kris well go ahead
meki nodded and turned to the cat

  now pay attention he commanded
sternly who are you

  im here said the cat

  i know youre here you pea-brained
idiot yelled meki  asked who you
were

  gently gently remonstrated kris

  well who are you 

  cat said the cat

  and who am i

  nice said the cat

  i am not nice roared meki im
meki im one of the evil cuperians
thats going to blow the world up and
destroy all the fish and pour all the
cream down the sewers now who am
i

  meki said the cat meki mopped
his brow with relief

  and who is he

  kris

  good good said meki is he an evil
cuperian too

  yes said the cat broad smiles
broke out on the faces of the two cuper-
ians they leaned forward hopefully

  now said meki think carefully
how did we get here

  your ship crashlanded said the
cat and both of you had been condi-
tioned never to let inferior creatures
like humans know of the presence of
superior creatures like evil yous so
you automatically buried the ship and
hid all traces and have been waiting
here for someone to rescue you there
are more yous out on the moon but they
dont know youre in trouble because
you have no way to signal them but if
people knew you were evil cuperians-
cuperians-cuperians-

  -then the scanning station-
prompted meki

  -then the scanning station with
their psych scanners would notice it and
investigate and find you and take you
away the scanning station cant find
you now because it is set for human
minds so all you can do is let the
humans find out but you cant let hu-
mans find out because you are condi-
tioned not to let humans find out but-
finished up the cat im not an intelli-
gent creature so you can tell me
fine fine said meki now dont
you think you should do something
about it

  the cat looked at him blankly
  idiot exploded meki suddenly
show me the wat to go home	bs

im telling you to-to- he choked off
suddenly vocal cords straining face
turning a bright crimson in his unsuc-
cessful attempt to force the forbidden
order to betray their presence past his
conditioned block

   relax said kris patting his friend
on the shoulder if the creature cant
understand it cant understand

   im hungry said the cat

  with a furious gesture meki swept
his plate of pressed duck onto the floor
in front of it

  here he bellowed eat stuff
yourself choke ungrateful beast
not ungrateful beast said the cat
gravely hungry beast

   oh go away said meki despairing-
ly and the cat much to its own disgust
turned obediently away from the pressed
duck and trotted into the bedroom there
it meowed piteously until meki wearily
remembered himself and carried the
pressed duck in to it

t really dont know said meki
i sadly coming back from the bed-
room weve tried just about every
way conceivable to attract attention
did the-hotel manager get in touch
with you about the bill weve been run-
ning up here

  oh yes sighed meki my reflexes
took over and i talked him out of it he
ended by suggesting we stay here per-
manently i cant take it i tell you
he added wildly ill develop paranoic
tendencies see if i dont

  come now said kris shocked
weve been in some tough spots before
this remember the ice fields of urana
or the lava prospecting on drusus

   but that said meki his voice crack-
ing that was plain ordinary hardship
its this insane barbaric opulence i ask
for a glass of cold water and they give
me a glass of warm water with chunks
of frozen water in it- his voice rose
to a scream isnt that funny isnt
that ridiculous ha-ha-ha- and he
went off into a shriek of hysterical
laughter

  meki roared kris

  not cold water screamed meki
half-cold half warm tricky h
clever eh ha-ha-ha-ha-

  kris slapped him sobering him up
now thats better said kris as
meki buried his nose in the napoleon
brandy keep your chin up ive got
the feeling that cat will be the saving of
us yet meanwhile well do what we
can

   if i ever get out of this said meki
fervently i swear ill never go pros-
pecting again

  and i too said kris however
lets get down to ways and means what
all have we tried so far we started
a fire-

   and they arrested that little old lady
on our recommendation said meki
we robbed a bank-

  the morning paper says the police
are baffled

  and we called on that scientist-
whats-his-name

  luodomann said meki the one
who was preparing a report on ten years
of work to prove the existence of extra-
terrestrial life

  oh yes sighed kris glumly he
shot himself when we proved logically
that he was wrong but- he said
brightening - theres something you
dont know about i sent in a fake in-
come tax return under your name

   i know said meki i spied on you
stole the return back from the mailman
and burned it

  oh said kris there was a moment
of bitter silence suddenly however he
sprang from his chair jubilantly

   ive got it he cried lets take the
cat and go get drunk and get picked up
by the police one of us is bound to
babble

   mekis face lit up

  the very thing he echoed here
cat

  the cat came running eagerly into the
room meki picked him up

   come on boy said meki jubilantly
were going to paint the town red
	startling stories

a rming themselves with a good sup-
-f- ply of the money stolen from the
bank they hurried out of the hotel and
hunted up the worst section of town it
was a dirty dingy saloon below street
level where a slovenly bartender lazily
flicked flies from the glasses with his
bar-towel the three comrades lined up
at the bar the cat on top of it

  gimme a shot said meki

  gimme a shot said kris

  gimme a shot said the cat

  the bartender stared at the cat

  a talking cat he said incredulous-
ly-

  mekis face lit up but kris reflexes
had already taken over and the words
flowed in a smooth stream from his
mouth

  of course naturally he said cheer-
fully to the bartender youve heard of
this play harvey- where the hero has
an invisible rabbit or pooka well
pookas may be invisible but cats are
not youve certainly seen cats before
and this is a persian cat if a pooka
can talk so can a persian of course-
he leaned across the bar and shook the
bartender warmly by the hand of
course i knew youd understand as i
said to my friend bartenders arent sur-
prised by anything and you arent
hah hah and he laughed heartily

  hah hah echoed the bartender
weakly not sure whether this was a joke
or not and then meki much to his own
disgust found words forcing themselves
past his lips

  my friend he said confidentially
leaning over the bar is a ventrilo-
quist

  oh said the bartender relieved

  gimme another said the cat

  heh heh said the bartender pour-
ing another shotglass full for the cat
cute little devil isnt he

  er-yes said the two cuperians
watching in some surprise as the cat
tossed off his second shot glass with
flying tongue and shoved it forward for
a refill for the first time a sinking
sensation made itself felt in the breasts

of meki and kris

  you know said the former voicing
this in a whisper in the latters ear
maybe it would have been just as smart
to leave him at home

   mekis fears were only too well found-
ed the next couple of hours disclosed
at the end of that time the two cuper-
ians drink as they might were only
slightly high but the cat owing to its
smaller blood content was roaring
drunk it staggered down the bar cater-
wauling happily

  shh said meki nervously grab-
bing it by the shoulder

  lemme go said the cat making an
ineffectual swipe at him with one paw
i can lick any tom in the room
but pointed out kris there arent
any toms in the room here

   then lesh go find some said the cat
embracing him i dont want to fight
you youre my buddies youre the
nicest most evil cup-cuperians in the
worljl

   the faces of kris and meki lit up but
a split second later their reflexes had
taken over and they were holding the
cats jaws firmly closed

  what did he call you guys asked
the bartender suspiciously

   canarians said kris glibly from
the canary islands you know

  oh said the bartender and they
carried the struggling feline outside

  damn it said meki if wed only
been able to stay there maybe the cat
would have talked some more

  well theres other bars kris
pointed out reasonably suppose we
try one down the line here a way

rplie other bars however proved to
- be pretty much of a repetition of the
first that is to say they would have
a few drinks the cat would start talk-
ing and at the first suspicious word
they would find themselves hustling it
outside to top all this off the cat passed
out in the fifteenth bar and could not be
persuaded to say another word the two
cuperians sat in dispirited silence in the
show me the way to go home	

last bar a small cosy place by the name
of louies nite club and gloomed at
their drinks that is to say they
gloomed until meki was suddenly struck
with the bright side of the matter

  say he said happily making a
grab for his glass and missing kris i
do believe im getting a little drunk

   well ill be flipped said kris try-
ing to focus on his glass which seemed
to be doing a sort of geometric dance
with four or five hazy duplicates of it-
self i think i am a little that way my-
self

   of course said meki closing one
eye slyly we arent really drunk not
us cuperians on this weak human liquor
but maybe were just a little bit high
enough to get by do you suppose were
drunk enough to be picked up by the
police

  could be agreed kris lets go
find out

   lets said meki but first lets
take a little nap

  good idea said kris just the
thing good night

   but meki his head down on his arms
was already snoring and kris with a
tolerant smile at the younger cuperians
ability to hold his alcohol lost no time
in following his example

  he woke up later-but after that
things got hazy

  kris returned to consciousness be-
cause meki was shaking him through
bleared and aching eyes he looked
around him five inches in front of his
nose was a cement wall on which some-
body had scrawled in pencil

   stoiie walla do not a prison make

   nor iron bars a cage

   he pondered this for a few seconds
becoming conscious of an aching head
and the fact that he appeared to be lying
on some rather hard surface finally
deciding the matter was worth investi-
gating he rolled over to discover the
fact that he was in a cell and that meki
was standing over him excitedly wav-
ing a newspaper

  wake up meki was shouting
that cat has got us in a fine mess
he shoved the newspaper into kris
hands and indicated an article on the
front page i hypnotised the jailer
into getting me a copy of the morning
paper read what it says about us
kris groaned sat up and focused with
difficulty on the item indicated

maniacs plead cat as only
defense

  kris eyebrows shot up in surprise
he read on

  two maniacs were taken into cus-
tody this morning after a drunken de-
bauch with a cat leading through a num-
ber of bars bartender otto bikonsky
at the blue point bar called police when
the maniacs ran out of money and in-
sisted that the cat write a check for
further funds when the cat made no
move to do so a loud argument ensued
climaxed by the arrival of the police
upon being taken to headquarters the
maniacs refused to furnish any informa-
tion about themselves referring all
questions to the cat and stating loudly
that since it the cat had gotten them
into this it was up to the cat to get them
out to date the cat has refused to utter
a word and a sanity hearing is sched-
uled before judge custer p polk af-
fectionately known in courthouse circles
as committin custer a careful check
of city banks today revealed that the
cat possesses no checking account
well said kris looking painfully
up at meki

  kris said meki shaking him for
snarks sake kris im frightened you
see what it says-maniacs kris maybe
theyre right maybe we are going in-
sane remember those two just like us
that got marooned on kathol when the
survey station found them they were
already in an insane asylum and so bad-
ly infected they had to be left there
remember 

  kris shuddered

i hadnt thought of that he said
kiis weve eot to vet out of here
	startling stories

  all right all right said kris sup-
porting his aching head he took a min-
ute to sort out his thoughts and then
sent out a mental call

some seconds elapsed and then a
portly individual in an olive-drab
uniform came waddling down the corri-
dor between the cells he stopped before
their door and stared at them glassily

  well open it up snapped meki
impatiently the portly individual
stared shook himself produced a key
and unlocked the door

  now show us the way out said
kris automaton-like the jailer pre-
ceded them up the corridor ran head-
long into a steel door and knocked him-
self out

  now isnt that just like a human
said meki in deep disgust cant think
for themselves at all under hypnosis
now how are we going to get through
the door 

  it doesnt seem to be locked said
kris pushing at it cautiously it
yawned open and they stepped through
into a room containing a high desk and
several uniformed individuals in various
poses of relaxation

  jailbreak yelped one whipping out
his gun he stared at it in surprise and
then began to suck childishly on the bar-
rel the others smiled and nodded and
indicated a door in the far wall

  they went through- the door into an-
other corridor down an elebator and
out of the building they went back to
the princess suite at their hotel and
opened the door

  the cat uttering glad cries flung it-
self into their arms   

  now what asked kris morosely
when they had finished a light but nour-
ishing snack of crepes suzettes and
opened a jereboam of champagne

  i ran away said the cat proudly

  we know snapped meki youve
told us fifteen times already

  i didnt say a word added the cat
preening itself

  thanks said kris sourly he

poured some champagne into a coffee
cup drink that and keep quiet

  the cat lapped happily kris turned
back to meki

  now what he repeated

  kris said meki desperately we
cant waste any more time i can feel
paranoic tendencies nibbling at my
sanity right now varve yourself and
see if you dont notice the same thing
kris did and shuddered

  youre right he said that foolish
business of getting drunk speeded up
the process

  listen kris said meki weve got
to signal the moon direct

  but how protested kris all
theyve got on this godforsaken planet
is radar and i dont know a thing about
that and an operation as delicate as
that cant be handled by direct hypno-
sis

  meki groaned

  oh why didnt i study my ancient
sciences like professor smrgi wanted
me to if he said it once he said it a
hundred times meki you never know
when it may come in handy to be able
to make a catapult or to levitate your-
self and i just laughed if i can just
get out of this ill make it a point to
go back and apologize

  ive got it said kris snapping his
fingers how about a large mirror
we could flash them a message in inter-
stellar code

  meki grimaced sourly

  its a penal offense to make back-
ward natives work for you he said

  i know said kris solemnly but
think which you prefer fifty years at
hard labor or an indefinite stay-maybe
a permanent stay if webecome men-
tally infected-on earth

  the alternatives were only too clear
meki faced up to them like the cuperian
he was he shook hands solemnly with
kris

   well do it he said

   ill help said the cat

   oh no you dont said meki swiftly
we dont want you balling up the
show me the way to go home	

works again kris what can we do with
him

  kris thought

  ive got an idea he said he turned
to the cat how would you like to learn
to read

   read  repeated the cat

  youd love it said meki heartily
everybody does when they first learn
how kris you teach him while i order
up some material he picked up the
phone and put in a call to the cigar
counter in the lobby for all the blood-
and-thunder they had in the way of
pocket books and magazines by the
time a bellboy came staggering up with
an armload of these articles kris with
the aid of the morning newspaper had
rendered the cat semi-literate

  youll pick up more words as you go
along kris informed the cat as he and
meki left the feline surrounded by gar-
ish covers oh one other thing-
youve seen meki and i answer the
phone

  the cat nodded

  well you know how its done if
anybody should call while were gone
you tell them weve left town and take
a message got it

  yes answered the cat

  good said kris and they went out

 fter driving around in a taxi for
some time they decided that the
best thing would not be one big mirror
but innumerable smaller mirrors
mounted on all the rooftops in town and
operated in unison accordingly they
got out of their taxi in a central portion
of town and sent out a mental call

  immediately all through the business
section normal activity ceased the
butcher the baker the candlestick
maker the president of waxies inc
that is who happened to be vacationing
in town at the time to say nothing of
innumerable other people in all sorts of
trades and professions immediately felt
a sudden distaste for their usual func-
tions and a corresponding overwhelming
urge to rush up on the rooftop of what-

ever building they happened to be in
and construct mirrors cheering and
laughing happily they threw away their
typewriters adding machines stetho-
scopes and monkey wrenches tore down
all sorts of reflecting surfaces and went
scurrying up stairs and out onto shin-
gles eaves or tiles within a certain
rough circle of area the town took on
an air of carefree holiday and festival
while outside that area people pointedly
ignored what was going on within-un-
less that is they happened by accident
to cross the boundary line in which case
they were struck by the industrious
madness that went on around them

   very good said meki to kris
 watching a bank executive smash a store
 window and take out a large dressing
 room mirror while the proprietor of
 the store cheered happily but i wish
 theyd hurry im beginning to get a
 funny feeling

   kris mopped the perspiration from
 his brow

   i must be out of shape he said

 -im having a rough time handling these
 people are you sure youre doing your
 share he looked suspiciously at meki

   my share muttered meki avoiding
 his eye me certainly why not but
 why why-

   meki cried kris staring at his
 friend snap out of it whats wrong
 with you

   me answered meki in an odd tone
 nothing nothing could be wrong with
 me but- he suddenly clutched at
 kris sleeve

   look he hissed that little man
 over there hes staring at me
 nonsense said kris trying to dis-
 engage himself he isnt even looking
 at you

   he is he was said meki wildly
 but you wont admit it youre all
 against me all of you but ill beat
 you yet you want to take me back to
 cuper for-psycho-conditioning but i
 wont let you and under the sudden
 surge of mekis mind little bodies of
 men around the town began pulling
	startling stories

 down their mirrors and getting into
 fights with others who were still putting
 theirs up

  kris fell back the horror of realiza-
tion printed on his face they had de-
layed too long meki was already men-
tally infected that meant that he with
his only slightly higher stability rating
had only a matter of minutes left the
scanning station personnel would have
to reach them in less than six hours in
order to save them after that the
damage of infection would be beyond
repair there must be some way to get
through to the station in time in a last
surge of desperate effort his mind
sought for an answer-and found it

t eaving meki madly engaged in
tearing down what they had built
he groped his way to the nearest tele-
phone and as his mind sunk into in-
sanity the last thing he remembered
was his voice babbling desperately into
the mouthpiece

  he awoke to the blissful peace of the
infirmary in the scanning station an
orderly was bending over him

  am i- he croaked

  youll be all right said the orderly
his kindly cuperian face beaming down
on him how do you feel want an-
other shot of nerve-titillator

  no thanks sighed kris relaxing
meki 

  hes all right too said the orderly
and the cat sends you his love we
offered to take him off earth with you
two but he preferred to stay with the
humans he was used to affecting scene
at the end there though he took my
hand in both paws and shook it with
tears in his eyes

  did he said kris feeling despite
himself a little touched tell me what
happened

  well according to what he told me
you didnt make too much sense over
the phone but as you surmised there

had been all sorts of noble heroes in
those books and magazines he had been
reading so that when you told him that
the city was doomed to be destroyed by
invading cuperians but that he could
save himself he bravely decided to stick
by his guns and warn washington

  he immediately made a long distance
call to the fbi and informed them of
the situation insisting that he be put
through to the president i gather they
gave him a rough time but knuckled
under when they found where the call
was coming from i guess they figured
anyone with enough money to rent the
princess suite deserved to be listened to
for a minute or two the upshot of it
was that the cat spoke to the president
and told him off rather sharply about
the inadequacy of the space-warning set-
up in that area of the country at any
rate it was enough to make the fbi
start a routine investigation and of
course our scanners picked it up at once
and deducted your presence

  and- ventured kris hesitantly
-the mirrors

  what mirrors asked the orderly
you were both babbling about them
but we didnt see anything out of the
ordinary about the mirrors where you
were

  never mind said kris happily re-
laxing just a hallucination i guess
ah itll be good to get back to cuper

  to cuper said the orderly sur-
prised oh i forgot you didnt know
its been decided to raise earth to inter-
stellar apprenticeship level and all citi-
zens having any knowledge of the planet
have been requisitioned for work in the
human cities-with adequate mental
shields of course for you and meki
itll be quite familiar territory wont
it

  there was a long moment of silence

  i think ill take that shot of nerve-
titillator after all said kris in a dull
voice better make it a double

jeff awarded himself a day off and took mona around the ity

i

the solar visicasting system owned
and occupied its own building on the
avenue of the planets in nuyork the
visibuilding as it was known was one
hundred and seventy storeys of impos-
ing steel stone and glass terraced and
scalloped in the most modern design in
it were the five hundred huge studios in
which svs produced the shows which
were visicast through its thousands of
affiliates all over terra and since they

had built hundreds of coaxial satellites
throughout the galactic federation
there were thirty storeys filled with cler-
ical help script girls page boys and the
stenographers pool there were forty
storeys of executives-the higher you
went the more important the executive
culminating finally in the private office
of the president of the network which
occupied the entire th floor

  in studio -c they were rehearsing

he had a galaxy full of prospective customers




a novelet by
kimhll foster crossed

the galaxy gaieties they were doing a
costume piece on the musical and in one
comer of the studio theyd built a field
complete with babbling brook towering
trees and such scarce terran animals as
horses and cows the rehearsal was tem-
porarily at a standstill while the director
argued with a representative of nojul
ransome denning and eeee the adver-
tising agency the latter claimed that
the makeup on one of the cows didnt

look authentic while the director was
patiently explaining theyd used the best
research man in the business

  jeff reynolds had taken advantage of
the lull to make a date for lunch with
mona parker the beautiful star having
accomplished this he blew her a kiss and
started to leave the director saw him
jeff boy he called you like
whats your rating jeff asked
two thousand fifty-four on the beel-

love that air

but he had only one product to sell-himself


startling stories

 

son rating two thousand fifty-three on
the stooper

   then i like jeff replied i love i
adore and youre a sweetheart

   i love you boy the director said
and went back to his argument with the
advertising representative of fleet
chairs-treat your seat to a fleet-
who sponsored the show

   jeff left the studio and entered the
level converter as he stepped in he
noticed a small handsome man heading
energetically for the studio he was guy
dolla moran vice president in charge of
network programs although there were
plenty of official reasons why he might
visit the studio jeff knew that he was
going to ask for a luncheon date with
mona parker he grinned to himself
imagining the expression on the vice
presidents face on being turned down

   after a varied career as writer and di-
rector jeff reynolds was the supervisor
for night-time visicasts for svs the
next step up if he could make it was a
vice presidency it was generally agreed
in the industry that jeff was a young
man who was going places

  he always drank martian whisky on
the rocks bought all his clothes at
tookes brothers and said the things
that were expected of rising young ex-
ecutives the only thing that might mar
his prospects was that guy dolla moran
was his immediate superior and they
were both interested in the same girl
but jeff was confident of the outcome
he knew that mona also went out with
dolla moran but he was sure that she
was merely being politic and he was
equally certain that dolla moran would
accept the whole thing with good grace
when he realized that the best man had
won jeffry was also well aware that the
president of svs matthew anderson

matthew anderson only a few years older than jeff was
codi-ldcnxi llic top ii in visicastmg circles hih imputation
temmed from the time when as a mere vice president hi
influence caused the election lawn of beta hydri iii to be
changed since that time the president of beta hydri is
the man who receives the most box tops from wheatleys
toasted comet fops of course from the visiscreen audi-
ence only those persons owning a visiacrccn set are eligi-
ble to vote whenever advertising or visicasting men get
to talking shop over their martian-whiaky-on-the-rock
sooner or later the conversation will get around to the
sheer genius of matthew anderson

thought highly of him and this was an
important factor

t tpstairs jeff had to see one of their
 regular writers whose latest script
he was rejecting the writer listened in
bewilderment while jeff told the latest
funny story and then explained that he
didnt like the story

  i didnt feel it in here he said
thumping his chest when the writer de-
manded to know why he didnt like it i
love you sweetheart but youve got to
hit me

  looking as if hed like to the writer
picked up his script and departed keep-
ing a close eye on the time jeff saw
three more writers one he told that
they all loved his script and they only
wanted a few changes if hed rewrite
the lead character change the motiva-
tion and give it a new ending theyd
buy it the second writer wanted an in-
crease in his rate and was treated to a
long story of how production costs were
going up the third one was a new writ-
er they were considering for a new show
and jeff raved over every idea they dis-
cussed although be privately concluded
the fellow was a troublemaker he want-
ed to introduce too many new untried
ideas

  after the session with writers jeff
dropped in on two producers and a stage
designer and went over plans for shows
coming up the next day then he just
had time to dash to the conference room
for a general discussion of the new script
on their biggest dramatic show guy
dolla moran john leeds the script edi-
tor a lemster the director and veno
harrison the writer were already there
waiting for him he noticed that dolla
moran looked less friendly than usual

  as they always did at these confer-
ences the rest of them relaxed in vari-
ous poses and prepared to hear guy dolla
moran read the script aloud there had
been a time when the vice president had
considered himself an actor and he read
scripts with considerable feeling

  he read the first line of the script and
love that air



leaned back closing his eyes im see-
ing it he explained he always offered
the same explanation but as the rest of
them were also in some stage of seeing or
feeling it they paid no attention

  good he said after a moment of si-
lence am i right boys the others
quickly agreed

  the reading of the script went fine for
six or seven pages but then dolla moran
read a line and when hed finished seeing
it he was frowning

  no veno he said shaking his head
my mother wouldnt understand that
line am i right boys

  there was total agreement from all ex-

place veno after all im not a writer
he continued with the reading at the
end of the script there were only some
three hundred lines that needed rewrit-
ing and everyone was agreed that they
had a good script

  jeff reynolds rushed off to a meeting
with the network censor and they man-
aged to cut offensive things from ten
shows before lunch time

  mona parker was waiting by the stu-
dio door when jeff arrived downstairs
they grabbed a helicab and went to the
venusian haven for lunch the food
there was good the tables nicely se-
cluded and there would be sure to be one

fihtdktiw ofl the wcba

one of ken crossens most popular stories was the inimitable things
of distinction ss march  in which he performed a
wicked bit of vivisection upon galactic hucksters carrying on the tradi-
tion mr crossen returns to the fray with a new dose of insecticide for
the advertising moguls-the brethren of the ulcer some of the characters
youve met before appear briefly herein though it is not actually a sequel
to things of distinction it is fun though with many a sage
bit of thinking concealed beneath the gimmicks and gags

-the editor

cept the writer i dont get you he
said what kind of a criticism is that
we got an audience of twenty-seven bil-
lion on this show whos writing for your
mother

  four pairs of eyes stared reproachful-
ly at him

  you dont understand veno jeff
said gently hed been a writer himself
and he understood them if guys moth-
er wouldnt understand it then its got
to go ive met guys mother and let me
tell you shes a very unusual woman

  shed have to be to have produced
him the writer muttered but he said
it so low that only john leeds heard him
and he managed to turn his snicker into
a cough

  then were agreed guy dolla moran
said marking the script with his blue
pencil youll think up something in its

or two visigossips there who would re-
port them as an item on the next visi-
cast

  after a couple of drinks and a leisure-
ly lunch of sabikian pheasant jeff pro-
posed for the twenty-seventh time and
for the twenty-seventh time mona said
maybe

  of course i love you she said but
ive got to think of my career if i were
to marry you now guy would be furious
he might even convince the sponsor that
they should get a new star for the show
but if you get to be a vice president he
wouldnt dare to fire me then

  and if i dont get to be a vice presi-
dent you might marry him is that it
a girl could do worse mona said
she reached over and patted his hand
but even if i married him id still love
you you know that dear
	startling stories

  of course dear he said bitterly
come on wed better get back to the
shop its the early bird that catches the
vice president

  dont you mean that catches the
worm mona said doubtfully

  same thing jeff snapped he signed
the check and they went out and took a
helicab back to svs

  will i see you tonight he asked as
they reached the door of her rehearsal
studio

  i dont know she said check with
me later will you darling

  you mean if dolla moran doesnt ask
you then youll go with me  i had a date
with you last night so its his turn to-
night if he wants you is that the idea
dont be dreary she said coldly
im free terran and twenty-one
plus he said savagely and headed
for the level converter

ii

      hen he reached his office there
was a facsimile-memo on his desk asking
him to go to the presidents office as soon
as he returned from lunch he left a
visitape for his secretary and took the
level converter to the top floor

  he stepped off the converter into the
small office of andersons secretary she
gave him a friendly smile and waved him
on through the door that was marked
private

   with the exception of the small cubicle
for the secretary the entire top floor
was given over to the private office of
matthew anderson he was looked upon
as a creative executive and the decor
was planned accordingly his desk was
naturally at the far end of the floor a
conveyer belt made to resemble an old-
fashioned cobblestone walk ran from
the doorway to his desk winding
through a pleasant little woodland at
one point arching over a small stream
artificial birds perched in the artificial
trees occasionally chirped excerpts from
popular opera

the ceiling of the office was at least

two hundred feet above the floor altair-
an artists had created small clouds to
float about near the ceiling and there
was a control panel under andersons
desk so that he could make a small
amount of rain fall over the forest
above the clouds there was a miniature
solar system with the planets wheeling
about the sun in the proper fashion a
concealed spotlight constantly played on
the third planet in the tiny system

  nearer to the desk there was a well-
stocked bar with two bartenders in con-
stant attendance since the bartenders
were algolians who cannot hear any
sound below the supersonic level their
presence was no threat to office secrets

  jeff reynolds was still sulking over
mona so he ignored the conveyer and
walked across the office to the desk by
the time he arrived some fiften minutes
later he was in better humor although
it was not helped by seeing guy dolla
moran seated beside the presidents
desk

  jeff boy anderson said warmly
hows it going bov

  great jeff said

  it always goes all right with jeff
guy dolla moran put in hes a sweet-
heart that boy

  i love you guy jeff said automati-
cally as he dropped into a chair

  the president of svs beamed at his
two assistants jeff weve just been
talking about you he said

  its not true jeff said in mock hor-
ror i am dentalized by toothsavers
im always up in the air with mummer

i	treat my seat to a fleet my best
friends do tell me that i need a ransome
halo and i was seduced by the spon-
sors maiden aunt on a lovers carpet

  the last was a reference to the j c
lover carpet trust whose slogan was
nobody can resist a lovers carpet
and the other two men dutifully laughed
at the familiar office joke

  the thing is said anderson we got
a problem a toughie guy and i were
talking it over and he said you were just
the boy to solve it you know i think he
love that air	

                                                       

was right about you after all

   it just shows jeff said that the
denebian cannibal was right when he
said you cant keep a vice president
down theyll always come up with some
kind of an idea he was suspicious of
any recommendations from guy dolla
moran

   love that boy guy said lightly
now this is just off the cuff ander-
son said but you can pick up the details
later our trouble is on acamar two
its a class c planet and trade agree-
ments were signed a little over a year
ago we were on the ball right away and
made our usual arrangements we put
up half the money for acamarans to
build their own visistations our usual
contract with them agreeing to carry a
reasonable percentage of our shows guy
how many affiliates do we have on aca-
mar two now

  one hundred and one matt

   one hundred and one affiliates an-
derson said and theyre not carrying a
single commercial show off the network
at present

  how come jeff asked

   thats the problem boy glad to see
you getting right to the core of it
theyre carrying enough sustaining
shows so we cant accuse them of break-
ing the contract but the minute we sell
a show they drop it and pick up another
sustainer i dont have to tell you that
our sponsors are all raising hell over the
thing

  even the sustainers draw a small au-
dience the vice president said am i
right matt

   right guy theyre fighting us

  if they didnt have visicasting be-
fore jeff said maybe they just
havent accepted the medium yet
wrong track boy anderson said
they took to it like a rocket takes to
space in addition to our affiliate sta-
tions theres something like a hundred
independents they got big ratings
everyone of them there are close to a
billion visisets on the planet

   commercial resistance  jeff asked

the president shook his head they
carry plenty of commercials on the
independents all native products and
ive seen reports showing that the native
products have increased their sales three
hundred per cent since they started
using visicasting but they wont listen
to our advertising most of our sponsors
have opened branches on acamar and
theyre selling nothing a great big
doughnut its serious boy

  rugged jeff agreed it hardly
sounded like a job for him but if ander-
son had been convinced that it was there
wasnt much he could do about it

  so far anderson continued weve
been protected against the advertisers
trying to make deals directly with the
acamaran independent stations because
theres a federation law against it but
weve just learned that the planetary
association of manufacturers is bring-
ing pressure on the congress to repeal
the law weve got to work fast

   jeff nodded still not sure what they
were driving at

   well its all yours boy anderson
said clean this one up and youll be
solid there might even be a little pro-
motion

   wait a minute jeff said just what
is it you want me to do

  clean it up anderson snapped
straighten them out so they start using
our commercial shows my secretarys
already made a reservation for you on an
afternoon flight shell tell you what
time youre leaving see her on anything
else get on the ball boy

  whos in charge in our acamaran of-
fice jeff asked

  an acamaran i think his name is
tokka hes vice president in charge of
acamar but youll be in charge when
you get there ive already dictated a
visitape on it

  tokka is that his first or last
name 

   the president looked at the vice presi-
dent and the latter responded i think
he said that acamarans have only one
name
 an

   what kind of life on acamar jeff
  asked

    what kind of life  repeated ander-
  son he seemed to be losing his pa-
  tience the kind of life that wont buy
  our commercial shows thats the kind
  dont bother me with details jeff boy
  nobody ever got anywhere by standing
  around asking questions

    jeff take care of it guy dolla mor-
  an said am i right lover boy

    when were you ever wrong jeff re-
 turned being careful to keep any sugges-
 tion of irony out of his voice he turned
 and trudged back through the artificial
 forest

    andersons secretary handed him his
 reservation on the pan-galactic space-
 ways and told him that his ship took off
 at four that afternoon he had about an
 hour to make it she told him that shed
 also made a reservation for him at the
 bahari hotel in azoi city the capital of
 acamar she too was unable to tell him
 anything about the natives of acamar

   by this time he was convinced that
 the whole thing was a scheme of dolla
 morans to get him away from mona
 parker he strongly suspected that
 every experienced troubleshooter in svs
 had already fallen down on the job and
 that dolla moran had seized upon it as a
 perfect method to get him out of the way
 and at the same time stop his rapid ad-
 vancement in the company hed never
 thought about it before but dolla moran
 probably wouldnt like the idea of an-
 other vp in the same department

startling stories

h

iii

    -is suspicions only increased his
 frustrated anger even if he were right
 if the mess on acamar was completely
 insoluble there was nothing he could do
 about it hed still have to go to acamar
 and fall flat on his face in an orderly
 fashion to protest the assignment
 would be the quickest way to become un-
 employed

 he stopped off at his office and told his
 secretary hed be away for a few weeks

   just on the off chance that he might
 come through he left a few orders for
 his assistant which he knew would be
 beyond that young mans ability there
 was no point in giving the company the
 idea that his department could run just
 as well without him

   he stopped at the rehearsal studio to
 see mona but they were in the midst of
 a scene and an associate producer told
 him that they wouldnt break for an-
 other hour there was nothing to do but
 go without seeing her he left her a note
 and went downstairs

   a helicab took him to his apartment
 and he packed he saw that he still had
 a few minutes to spare a rather pleas-
 ant idea had occurred to him another
 cab quickly carried him to the main of-
 fices of the fleet seatery trust and the
 magic name of the solar visicasting sys-
 tem succeeded in getting him sand-
 wiched in between two regular appoint-
 ments

   old homer van fleet president of the
 chair trust scowled at him well young
 man he said i hope youve come to
 tell me that you people are going to do a
 better job for me

   i believe were doing a pretty good
 job  jeff said the show has a big rat-
 ing and ive seen the reports of your in-
 crease in sales since you started sponsor-
 ing galaxy gaieties

   thats generally true van fleet
 said but there are a number of spots
 throughout the federation where youre
 not delivering now-

   thats what i wanted to discuss with
 you jeff interrupted hastily im just
 on my way-catching a space liner in
 just a few minutes in fact-to acamar
 to clean up the trouble there it occurred
 to me that theres a way you might be of
 some help-and perhaps get a bit of a
 jump on other manufacturers in the
 aiea

  how

   galaxy gaieties is one of the most
popular visiscreen shows in the uni-
verse jeff said and i think we can
safely say that mona parker is the best
love that aik	

known and best loved visistar in the fed-
eration i believe that it might be of
considerable assistance if she and the
show went to acamar on a personal ap-
pearance tour

  the old man looked at him from his
little shrewd eyes that would cost
more money wouldnt it

  yes sir but i believe it would be
well-spent these new planets may feel
left out of things and it might give them
the idea that fleet chairs is interested
in all aspects of their comfort

  maybe you got something the old
man said ill give it a thought glad
you came around young man like to
see you people on your toes

  jeff took the hint and left a helicab
got him to the spaceport with a few min-
utes to spare lie felt sure that llomer
van fleet was going to ta-c his sugges-
tion and it was with considerably more
cheer that be boarded the space liner

  there was as yet no regular passen-
ger line to acamar two and it was a
testament to the power of svs that the
liner swerved a few light years off her
course and stood by while a lifeboat de-
livered jeff reynolds to the second plan-
et in acamars orbit

  the spaceport on acamar was a small
but attractive spot on an island in a lake
as he entered the main building jeff
caught his first glimpse of acamarans
having already traveled about the fed-
eration he was prepared to accent almost
any form of intelligent life but the aca-
marans were humanoid in their general
outlines they seemed to average about
five feet in height although there were
a few who were taller he guessed that
their weight was about proportionate to
that of terrans they all were dssed
in clothes similar to those worn on terra
theiraces were more animal-like and
they had rather prominent buck teeth
there was something just a bit rat-like
in their faces but it was not at all un-
pleasant he also noticed that their faces
were covcred with soft brown hair and
that they had broad flat tails protruding
from their clothes

  a helicab almost as modem as the
ones on terra took him to his hotel it
was a long enough ride to give him a fair
impression of azoi city none of the
buildings were over two or three storeys
in height although the flatness was
rather startling at first he soon found
them pleasant to look at more than half
the streets were broad canals filled with
water and to his surprise he liked the
effect he remembered vaguely having
read that once a terran city had had
such canals in the place of streets al-
though it was already night looking
down in the soft light of street lamps
he saw a handful of young acamarans
swimming in the canal and felt a fleeting
kinship with them

  he had dinner in the hotel to his re-
lief the menu included a wide variety of
terran foods he thought of trying to
learn something about the planet but
realized that it would be easier and more
efficient to get it from the local svs vice
president so he went to bed early

rpiie following morning he breakfast-
ed in the hotel then called a helicab
and directed it to the solar visicasting
building it turned out to be the only tall
building in the city on terra its fifty
storeys would have seemed minute here
it towered over the city

  a few minutes later he was shaking
hands with an acamaran

  i am tokka vice president in charge
of operations here he said he spoke
excellent terran the only evidence that
it wasnt his native tongue showing in a
slight struggle between the sibilants and
his buck teeth mister anderson noti-
fied me you were on your way i am glad
to have you here mister reynolds
thank you jeff said he found him-
self liking the acamaran alien though
he w-as i hope you wont feel that its a
matter of someone coming in to take
over its not that at all mister tokka
please on acamar we do not go in
for formal titles just as we have never
adopted your custom of two or more
names please call me tokka
	startling stories

  then call me jeff were really not so
formal on terra in spite of our names
and titles we usually call each other baby
or sweetheart

  ive noticed tokka said dryly
now how would you like to approach
our problem jeff

  well jeff said i suppose i should
learn as much as possible about the plan-
et and your people by the way ive nev-
er seen an acamaran before last night
yet theres something familiar about
your race what are your antecedents
as you must know tokka said
there is some relationship between all
peoples of-the galaxy one species forges
ahead on this planet another species de-
velops on that one we acamarans be-
long to the order known on terra as
rodere i believe that certain of our own
anthropologists have classified us as
rodere erectus as to our more specific
class you probably find the teeth and
the tail familiar clues

  although many forms of terran ani-
mal life had vanished years before jeff
reynolds had once been a steady visitor
to the terran museum of ancient his-
tory suddenly he remembered why the
acamarans had seemed familiar
beavers he exclaimed

  exactly tokka said nodding we
are closely related to the form of life you
knew as beavers on your planet they
remained stationary on the evolutionary
scale while on acamar the same life
form continued to develop

  then that explains the canals the
reason for almost every home being sur-
rounded by water

  of course my ancestors built their
homes in water and so this has become
traditional in our architecture the same
influence restrains us from building
what you once called skyscrapers in
many of the older houses here you will
also find a traditional door built below
the surface of the water your ancestors
lived in caves and trees so your archi-
tecture has featured cave-like apart-
ment houses and the towering structure
of the tree there is emotional security

  in retaining some aspect of the patterns
of our beginnings

  jeff would have liked to pursue the
subject further but he reminded himself
that he was here on business

  you know why im here he asked

  tokka nodded

  what is your own theory about it
jeff asked surely you as an acamaran
should be able to know why the stations
here will not carry any of our commer-
cial shows or why terran products
dont sell here

  to my shame i should tokka said
unfortunately we acamarans have not
had your experience in such matters im
afraid it is beyond my rather simple
mind it is true that the terran manu-
facturers have done nothing to adapt
their products to our needs but this
should not stop all sales so far as ter-
ran advertising is concerned i have been
able to arrive at only one conclusion

  whats that

  well it may be that your advertising
is so subtle that we are unable to per-
ceive the essence of its influence

  too subtle jeff exclaimed in sur-
prise hed heard many criticisms of
terran advertising but to the best of his
knowledge this was the first time anyone
had ever accused it of being too subtle
he could hardly believe his ears

  tokka nodded vigorously that is my
theory perhaps you wilkbe able to dis-
cover if it is correct you see even now
we have had very little contact with you
terrans we have had access to much of
your literature both visual and audio
and we have learned and adopted  great
many of your customs and fashions but
since we have had very little direct con-
tact im sure there are psychological
factors which escape us surely a race
like yours so much more advanced than
mine must be more subtle in yourtneth-
ods of influencing sales

  maybe jeff said doubtfully

iv

j eff snent most of the day carefully
love that air	

wading through a great mass of reports
even with the explanations tokka of-
fered they made very little sense to him
he agreed to have dinner at tokkas
home so they left the office early and
made a brief tour of azoi city with the
slight architectural difference there
were many reminders of terran cities
where there were terran and acamaran
stores side by side it was impossible to
tell them apart window displays and
outside signs would be identical yet
jeff noticed that acamarans strolling
along the walks on either side of the can-
als would pause to look into the terran
windows then walk on but when they
stopped to gaze at the same display in an
acamaran store they would invariably
end by entering

  after a while he noticed that there
seemed to be an unusual number of den-
tists in the civ and nearly all dental of-
fices carried a sign announcing they spe-
cialized in dental amputations jeff ex-
pressed his curiosity

   one of the penalties of civilization
 tokka explained in more primitive
 times my people used their teeth to cut
 down trees which were utilized in con-
 structing our homes and dams the con-
 tinual use kept our teeth sharpened
 down to the proper length but now we
 have become mechanized and our teeth
 serve only to eat our food as a result
 our front teeth continue to grow
 throughout our lives at regular periods
 we must have the teeth amputated or
 they would get so long that we would
 not be able to eat at all

   that night jeff had dinner at tokkas
 home meeting the rest of the family
 he learned that acamarans didnt use
 the husband and wife designation com-
 mon on most planets but merely re-
 ferred to their mates with nothing in
 the reference to indicate sex

  it was a pleasant evening there was
a close family feeling in tokkas home
which jeff had seldom seen in terran
homes he liked both tokka and gha-
mik and even enjoyed it when the three
small children all climbed on his lap at

once and demanded that he tell them a
terran story

   the following day there was a visitape
 from the home office announcing the de-
 cision to send the galaxy gaieties to
 acamar on a personal appearance tour
 considerably cheered up by it jeff went
 out with tokka on a round of the local
 advertising agencies and the independ-
 ent visiscreen stations

   by the end of the second day jeff rey-
 nolds was in a greater confusion about
 acamar two than he had been before
 leaving terra he had examined hun-
 dreds of pages of local advertising copy
 and had absorbed a great deal more in
 the rehearsal and actual visicasts of nu-
 merous local shows as near as he could
 tell their advertising was about on a par
 with that of terra perhaps a thousand
 years earlier it was crude dogmatic
 and bumbling yet he sat in with dozens
 of studio audiences and watched them
 rush out to buy the product the minute
 the show was over he visited homes to
 watch the visiscreen and again saw the
 observers rush out to buy as soon as the
 show went off the air he had to confess
 -but only to himself-that on at least
 two occasions he had felt a faint desire
 to respond in the same fashion it was
 to put it mildly baffling

   it its not a question of subtlety
 tokka suggested perhaps there is some
 difference in the metabolism of our two
 races since our advertising fails to move
 you just as yours fails to reach us

   this was so obviously silly on the face
 of it that jeff didnt bother to even an-
 swer and at the end of two days mona
 parker arrived on acamar and he firmly
 pushed the problem from his mind

  isnt it wonderful darling she
greeted him our sponsor suddenly de-
cided to send us here for a personal ap-
pearance tour well be here all of two
weeks and now you can start showing
me this quaint little society

   simply wonderful jeff agreed hed
 decided with a sudden flash of intuition
 not to tell her his own part in the per-
 sonal appearance tour it might make
	startling stories

her start feeling sorry for guy dolla
moran as the victim of a trick it was
enough that jeff was himself aware of
having gotten the better of the vice
president

  the actual appearances didnt start
until the following day so jeff awarded
himself a well-earned day off and took
mona around the city at first he was
slightly annoyed at her obvious condes-
cension about the acamarans but he
was so delighted to be with her that he
soon forgot it

  that night they had dinner together
then danced until quite late afterward
at monas insistence they went for a
midnight swim in the canal in front of
her hotel then she invited him to
her rooms for a goodnight drink this
was the first time shed ever done this
and he wondered if it werent the ro-
mantic result of the three moons which
sailed lazily above acamar ii

come three hours later a deliriously
 happy young visiscreen executive re-
turned to his own hotel the fact that
this left him a bare two hours of sleep
was unimportant and his auto-intoxica-
tion brought him briskly out of bed at
the proper time even the brave new
world had not basically changed the ac-
tions of young men who thought they
were in love

  his elation carried jeff to the offices
where in about two minutes it deserted
him the cause was the man who sat in
a chair talking to tokka it was guy
dolla moran

  jeff boy the vice president cried
how are you sweetheart

   fine jeff said with false heartiness
he pulled himself up out of the shattered
remains of what had been a victory and
tried to be natural how are you baby 
long time no see

  never felt greater the vice presi-
dent said it was obviously the truth jeff
thought ruefully matt and i thought
id better run up here and see that the
personal appearance of the gaieties gets
the old personal touch and while im

here i thought i might as well check in
early and go over the results of your lit-
tle mission

  oh jeff said all too aware that
there were no results

  tokka here has been giving me a
rundown on what youve been doing
the vice president went on not good
baby not good i love you jeff boy but
youre not using the old thinker

  you think im missing something
jeff asked

  its a big problem boy and youve
got to take a bigger look at it i dont
think you can even begin to think it out
until youve been over the whole situa-
tion ive just been telling tokka i think
the two of you ought to take a swing
around the whole planet say about two
weeks of finding out how they do out in
the corn belt-if they have any corn
jeff saw the idea at once mona par-
ker was scheduled to be in azoi city for
two weeks and then shed return to
terra guy dolla moran wanted him to
wander around over the planet for two
weeks his face tightened

  of course its only a suggestion the
vice president said you think im
wrong lover what say we call matt
and leave it up to him hes the one who
gets paid for thinking so we might as
well let him do it what do you say
sweetheart 

  jeff knew when he was licked he
knew that anderson had already been
sold on the idea or dolla moran would
have never suggested calling him no
he said slowly youre right guy abso-
lutely right its a wonderful sugges-
tion tokka and i will start out in a
day or two

  the vice president was shaking his
head more in sorrow than in negation
not the svs way sweetheart he said
you know that you know what matt
always says if its worth doing now
then it was worth doing yesterday
just before you came in i had tokka
call and charter a cruiser for the two of
you we have to move fast boy am i
right
love that air	

  youre right jeff said wearily he
tried not to see the grin on the vice
presidents face as he and tokka left

  once before they took off he tried to
call mona only to get the message that
shed left to meet mr dolla moran jeff
glumly climbed into the cruiser and they
left azoi city

  things in what dolla moran had called
the corn belt were no different than in
azoi city the acamarans would look
at terran advertising in utter boredom
and never go near a store they would
take one look at local advertising and
bolt to spend their money even tokka
reacted exactly the same way as the
other members of his race and no ad
ever failed to send them all scuttling for
the nearest vendor it was maddening

  by dint of constantly urging tokka
on from one place to another they man-
aged to cover the entire planet in thir-
teen days it was the evening of the
thirteenth day when they landed back
in azoi city jeff immediately called
mona only to learn that she had already
left with mr dolla moran his only hope
had been that the vice president had
gone back to terra after fretting rid of
him and that he would still have a stolen
twenty-four hours to spend with the
star with that hope colansed he final-
ly consented half-heartedly to go home
with tokka

  there was a happy reunion between
tokka and the rest of the family which
only made jeff feel worse there was a
quite good dinner but he failed to taste
a single bie of it afterward they all
sat down to watch the visiscreen

  there was a quite good dramatic show
on but jeff only stared at it blankly
then it was time for the commercial
the minute it started he recognized it
as the one for an acamaran drink called
aqui-cola hed checked the particular
ad any number of times-and had even
tried the drink which he thought horri-
ble-so jeff displayed little interest he
was vaguely aware that the family sud-
denly seemed restless then a moment
later he found himself in the grip of an
uncontrollable yearning for aqui-cola

he leaped to his feet and joined the
others in a rush for the kitchen

  the case of aqui-cola in the refrig-
erator lasted only a few minutes while
they all guzzled happily jeff himself
consumed three bottles before his
strange thirst abated

  lucky you put in a supply today
tokka said to ghamik well have to
pick up some more tomorrow some-
thing must have happened there was
now a puzzled frown on tokkas face as
they went back into the living room

v

the commercial had been replaced
by an acamaran announcer who wore
an apologetic expression

  my dear friends he was saying i
wish to extend the apologies of aqui-
cola the independent stations of aca-
mar and myself for the commercial
which was just visicast due to circum-
stances beyond our control the adver-
tising was entirely too strong until
we can locate the trouble we are sign-
ing off

  so that was it ghamik said getting
up and turning off the set

  jeff was staring at the visiscreen with
a puzzled air finally he turned to tok-
ka i dont understand he said as
near as  can remember that advertis-
ing copy was exactly the way it was
when we checked it i dont see where
there was a single word changed
words said tokka looking as puz-
zled as jeff of course they were not
changed the only change was in the
essence of the advertising

  but how can you change the essence
without changing the words jeff
wanted to know and why did such a
small change suddenly affect me ive
never had such a reaction in my life i
felt almost hypnotized

  thats right you did get it this
time tokka cried perhaps my origi-
nal theory was correct but in reverse
perhaps because we are a primitive peo-
ple we are the ones using the more sub-
tle advertising of course thats it i
	startling stories

had completely forgotten that the more
primitive the race the more acute the
sense- the acamaran broke off and
looked bewildered but that cant be
right either if it were we would be
more susceptible to your advertising not
less

   you left me back among the aster-
oids jeff said what the devil are you
talking about

   the advertising jeff if ours was
more subtle than yours then yours
would overpower us if yours was more
subtle than ours then ours would over-
power you but neither works that way
can it be-but no that is utterly im-
possible you do use perfume and-

   perfume interrupted jeff what
does perfume have to do with it

   but everything said tokka you
must know that you do use some per-
fume we can sense so it must be a mat-
ter-

   jeff interrupted again are you try-
 ing to tell me that you use some kind of
 perfume to overcome sales resistance

  of course everyone does-dont
they

   and it comes out of that set jeff
 asked gesturing toward the visiscreen

   naturally-

   and you have one perfume that will
make everyone rush out for an aqui-
cola another that will make everyone
want a new suit a third to create the
desire for a new helicar-a different
scent for every product you manufac-
ture

   yes yes tokka said but surely
you do too doesnt everyone is there
any other way

   jeff leaned back and counted slowly
up to ten then he opened his eyes and
looked at tokka if you have such
scents why do you bother with adver-
tising copy at all why not just spray
out the scent and forget about commer-
cials

   we used to do it that way tokka
said before we came in contact with
you terrans but we were anxious to
learn and your commercials seemed

such an entertaining custom so we
adopted them and used the scent at the
same time do you mean that you have
never used such scents

  ill tell you all about the history of
advertising later jeff said right
now we have a date he grabbed the
startled tokka by the hand and dashed
from the house almost falling into the
canal in his haste

tt took a dozen calls before jeff
found that guy dolla moran and
mona paier were having dinner in
something called the blue dam a
hastily summoned helicab took them to
the restaurant a headwaiter pointed
out the table and jeff marched down
upon it with the excited tokka in tow

  well guy old sweetheart jeff said
as he reached the table your troubles
are all over hello mona

  instead of the smile hed expected
the visiscreen star glared up at him
jeffry reynolds she said dont ever
speak to me again she got up and
swept away in the general direction of
the rest rooms

  now whats the matter with her
jeff said

  you know how it is baby guy dolla
moran said women are sensitive about
some things you shouldnt have been
so open about your little pleasures
tlittle pleasures jeff said what
little pleasures

  taking a little jaunt around acamar
with an alien female the vice president
said not only an alien female but one
who is married not the thing to do
jeff boy

  female repeated jeff looking from
dolla moran to tokka do you mean
he-i mean she-i mean-oh hell
exactly sweetheart of course tok-
ka is a female-and up until now i
thought a happily married one

  jeff stared dumbly at tokka

  i am a female tokka said but
what he is suggesting is utterly alien
to our culture it is impossible in addi-
tion to being untrue as you know
love that aik	

  but- said jeff gesturing toward
the hndsome tweed suit tokka wore

   oh the suit tokka said we were
quite taken with terran clothes when
we first saw them and quicky adopted
them it wasnt until very recently that
we discovered males and females on
terra dressed somewhat differently by
that time individuals on acamar had
become accustomed to whichever type
of dress their fancy had first hit upon
so no one bothered trying to conform to
a rule which seemed to have very little
sense you see jeff on acamar except
for mating there is no importance placed
on the sex of the individual so im
afraid it never occurred to me to men-
tion it to you im sorry

  im afraid dolla moran said
smoothly that mona will not be in-
clined to accept that story i do of
course but mona tends to be more old-
fashioned in her concept of morality
ill straighten that out later jeff
said impatiently in the meantime-
in the meantime the vice president
interrupted not only have you fallen
down on the job but youve been lead-
ing what many terrans might consider
an immoral life you both must be aware
of the morality clause in your contracts
 was going to leave a memorandum in
the morning but since youre here you
might as well know you are both through
at svs

   but you cant fire us exclaimed jeff
ive got-

   of course you have an explanation
dolla moran said i understand about
those things sweetheart ive traveled
around to the planets and ive had my
fun-more quietly its true but unfor-
tunately i am not a major stockholder in
the solar visicasting system and im
afraid the others are less broadminded
now i do wish youd leave so that mona
will feel that she can return to our
table

   for a moment jeff stood and glared
at his late superior then he turned
and strode from the room tokka fol-
lowed

vi

so stunned was he by the sudden
developments it was several days be-
fore jeff reynolds really began think-
ing about what had happened

  in the meantime he had taken a job
along with tokka at one of the inde-
pendent visicasting stations within a
couple of weeks he had a good under-
standing of the acamaran methods

  one night there was a conference
betwen jeff tokka ghamik and a
number of leading acamarans after
it was over jeff was ready to return
to terra

  since he no longer had the great net-
work back of him it was not a simple
matter to return but after a delay of
a week with the aid of a friend or two
on terra he managed to have one of
the space liners stop by and pick him up

  his first day back in nuyork was a
busy one he first went to the local
offices of the galactic federation then
set out to make a number of appoint-
ments by visiphone at eleven oclock
he showed up for the first one at the
office of homer van fleet this time he
was kept waiting slightly longer than
the time hed called before but he was
soon shown in to the large private office
but instead of the blunt-featured old
financier he was facing a quite attrac-
tive young woman

  i beg your pardon he said there
must be some mistake i had an appoint-
ment with mister van fleet

  no mistake mister reynolds she
said with a smile i am leesa van
fleet father is home sick today but
he said that i should see you i checked
with him when you called this morning
well thats nice jeff said that
is i dont mean that its nice that hes
ill-well you know what i mean

  she smiled and waited

   have two things to discuss with
you jeff said ill take up the least
important first i believe your company
still has the practice of paying a five
per cent commission on anyone who sug-
	startling stories

gests a new product and a new market
   she nodded

   fine incidentally i also have a free
suggestion for the acamaran market
which will very soon open design a new
chair with a built-in tail rest now
then i expect you normally have a con-
siderable waste of wood in building
chairs

   yes she said

  my suggestion is that this wood be
pulped then pressed into bars small
canes and such with a small amount of
flavor added and sold on acamar
flavored wood mister reynolds
flavored wood he said you see
acamarans are evolved from beavers
as a result of civilization they no longer
gnaw on wood and they have a lot of
tooth trouble so the idea is a sort of
wood candy on which they can gnaw
obtaining a flavor and preserving their
teeth i wouldnt be surprised that it
might be a bigger business than chairs
and i have an excellent advertising pro-
gram worked out for it which brings
me to my second point-its rather
lengthy and i wonder if we might not
discuss it over lunch 

   i think that would be very nice she
said

   after a more than pleasant luncheon
jeff reynolds hurried off to keen his
other appointments it was a full-after-
noon and it was shortly after four
oclock when he arrived at the svs
building he went immediately to the
top floor after exchanging a few words
with the presidents secretary he
stepped on the conveyor path and-was
whisked through the small forest

  in addition to matthew anderson and
guy dolla moran there were four other
men sitting there in the private office
with the exception of one man they all
seemed to be rather disgruntled

  sorry im a few minutes late gen-
tlemen jeff reynolds said as he stepped
off the conveyor pressure of business
you know

  whats the meaning of this rey-
nolds anderson demanded severely

he indicated the one man who did not
seem annoyed jones here demanded
that we all get together to hear you i
tried to point out that you are no longer
connected with svs but he still in-
sisted on it and would offer no explana-
tion naturally since he is the largest
stockholder   

  naturally jeff said he looked over
the assembled men i believe you gen-
tlemen together hold all of the shares
in the solar visicasting system rang-
ing from mister dolla moran who owns
two shares to mister jones who owns
two hundred thousand

  we own all the shares jones said
fine jeff said cheerfully i have
a proposition to put to you but first i
have another small matter to bring up
i have been seeing a number of impor-
tant terran industrialists today includ-
ing the owner of the jet rocket tobacco
company do any of you gentlemen
happen to smoke jet cigarettes

  from the shaking heads it was evi-
dent that none of them did

  as you know jeff continued jet
cigarettes do their advertising on a rival
network that is perhaps the reason no
one here smokes them we might how-
ever put them in the category of poten-
tial clients of svs i have just given six
packages of jet cigarettes to mr ander-
sons secretary i suggest that we have
them brought in and all of you try them
remember that jet cigarettes are long-
er that the harmful ingredients found
in other cigarettes have been removed
light a jet and be space happy

the six men looked at him as if they
had suddenly been offered proof that
he was insane

  if you ask mr andersons secretary
for the cigarettes now or within the
next thirty seconds she will give them
to you if you want them after the time
period is up they will cost you fifty
credits per package

  what sort of nonsense is this de-
manded one of the stockholders giving
us a lot of advertising fiddle-faddle and
love that air	

saying youll sell us ordinary thirty-
unit cigarettes for fifty credits

  i believe drawled guy dolla moran
that the colloquial expression is that
hes blown his space plates

  just a minute it was the man
named jones as the majority stock-
holder i insisted that the rest of you
be here i did so because this young man
phoned me and said that he had proof
that our stock could be worthless tomor-
row at his suggestion  checked with
charlie lane at planetary association
of manufacturers charlie assured me
that he knew what he was talking about
i dont know why hes talking about jet
cigarettes either but i suggest that we
hear him out

  thank you mister jones jeff said
my proposition gentlemen is this the
six of you own all the stock of the solar
visicasting system i am suggesting
that each of vou sell me one-half of your
stock and that one of you sell me an
additional share this you will say will
give me control of svs and you will be
quite right but it will also save the
company and make your remaining
shares more valuable than they have
ever been incidentally i expect to pay
each one of you exactly one credit for
the half he turns over to me

  there was an excited babble of voices
from the angry men

  this farce has gone far enough
said matthew anderson i suggest that
we call in the galactic police

  sales resistance eh  jeff said cheer-
fully he puled a small atomizer from
his pocket and pressed the trigger there
was a soft hissing sound although no
spray was visible

  what the- began anderson only
to break off startled expressions ap-
peared simultaneously on the faces of
the six men two of them started search-
ing through their pockets

  light a jet and be space happy one
of them repeated

your secretary said another to an-
derson i think he said she had some
as one man the six of them rose and

ran across the office jeff reynolds
pulled a jet cigarette from his pocket
and puffed happily on it

  a few minutes later the six men re-
appeared walking back through the
artificial forest each of them puffed on
a cigarette beyond them matthew an-
dersons secretary stood in the doorway
a puzzled frown on her face and her
hands full of money

  a great smoke anderson said as
they came up i dont know how i hap-
pened to overlook them before

  light a jet and be space happy
guy dolla moran said joyfully

vii

jeff reynolds waited smoking
his own cigarette after a moment
bewildered frowns appeared on their
faces six pairs of eyes swiveled toward
jeff

  how did you do that demanded
jones

  with this jeff said holding up the
atomizer total cost of the experiment
-less than one credit

  you mean you sprayed something in
the air that made us have to buy jet
cigarettes

  jeff nodded i could as easily have
made you have an irresistible desiie to
sell me your stock but i thought you
might appreciate a more normal com-
mercial application

  it can apply to other products an-
derson asked

  jeff nodded again this he said
is the secret of why our advertising
failed so miserably in competition with
acamaran advertising the acamarans
have been using these scents for years
they took up our commercials because
they thought them entertaining but this
is the sales force there are as many
different scents as there can ever be
products with this formula gentlemen
the people can be iqade to buy any-
thing

  or do anything asked one stock-
holder he was a well-known federa-
	startling stories

tion politician and very prosperous

   yes said jeff the things done
however would have to be limited by
ethical considerations

   of course of course the politician
said hastily

   jeff was all too familiar with the ex-
pression he saw on the faces in front of
him i might add he said that the
secret process for this formula is duly
patented under the monopoly laws of
the federation it is owned by the new-
ly-owned corporation of tokka ghamik
tishtiri azrak khamis and reynolds
i am by the way the majority stock-
holder

  this brought them rudely back to
reality and they stared at him with
speculation

  there are two ways the new adver-
tising medium can be used jeff said
certain changes could be made in our
visicasting system making it necessary
for everyone to buy new visiscreen sets
the new ones would have a built-in at-
tachment which enables the scent to be
sprayed into the room we could still
go on using advertising copy although
the actual selling will be done by the
secret process as you may have no-
ticed it has no noticeable odor it can
be mixed in proportion to affect any
form of life in the federation on aca-
mar for example their senses are more
acute than ours so that the mixture that
worked for them had no effect on us
on the other hand the process can be
introduced directly into the air by a
company representing advertisers some
such method as low-flying heli-cars dust-
ing cities i imagine we could get the
federation to allocate time channels so
there would be no confusion

  there was a long silence in con-
nection with your first method one of
the men said ironically i suppose
youve also arranged to cut yourself in
for a slice of the visiscreen set manu-
facturing business

   of course jeff said by the wav
the process can also be used in connec-
tion with the dramatic end of visicast-

ing for example in crime shows we
might use a mixed formula which would
set up a hatred for law-breakers and a
love of our police force or in a comedy
we can hypo the script by a formula
which will make everyone think it is
very funny

   then there are the love stories   
one of the men said dreamily

  gentlemen jones interrupted all
of this makes interesting speculation
but i suggest that we face the fact that
young reynolds has us over a jet-
engined barrel i suggest that we sell
him one-half of our combined shares at
the stipulated price i will provide the
extra share he demands

  there was some crumbling but they
all finally agreed the transfer of stock
was soon accomplished and jeff gravely
paid out six credits

  i suppose matthew anderson said
that you will want my resignation
now

  why i love you matt boy jeff
said i wouldnt think of firing you-
as long as you keep on the ball at the
present t have only one administrative
change to suggest his glance passed
over guy dolla moran like a breath of
winter

  anything you suggest anderson
said eagerly

  we must have in the neighborhood
of a million offices throughout the gal-
axy jeff said in growing to such
size it is inevitable that some depart-
ments lag behind others in the progress

i imagine that a deplorable situation
which i noticed on acamar exists every-
where i suggest that the creative end
of svs is more than adequately manned
but that we need comparable talent in a
department which is often neglected we
have a man who is ideally suited for
what i have in mind i suggest that our
mr guy dolla moran be made the execu-
tive vice president in charge of all svs
restrooms

   excellent anderson said briskly

   the new executive vice president mut-
tered something but it was inaudible
love that air



  i love you guy boy jeff said as
he left the office

  news travels fast in the big networks
jeff reynolds stopped off briefly in his
old office and then went downstairs
mona parker was waiting in the lobby
looking more beautiful than ever when
she caught sight of him she ran forward
and threw her arms around his neck

  oh jeff she exclaimed ive just
heard the news youre wonderful are
you taking me to dinner tonight

  jeff reynolds carefully disengaged
the arms from around his neck im
afraid not he said im sure it would
be pleasant but i must think of my
career i doubt if it would do me any
good to be seen with a mere actress

and im sure my fiancee would not ap-
prove

  your fiancee

  yes leesa van fleet we became
engaged at noon today a charming
girl he took a second atomizer from
his pocket and sprayed gently before
walking on

  miss mona parker glamorous star of
the galaxy gaieties turned and rushed
off in a different direction later the
visinews reporters were to describe her
mad dash all over nuyork and have a
prominent analyst offer a technical
and entirely wrong explanation of why
she had been seized with an uncon-
trollable desire for sour grapes when
the nearest ones were on vega iv

 a novelet by
 miriam all ex de ford

   mcelioy would never have started that time travel business if
   hed known the future would reach out and sock him in the jaw

    i

 think said dr schultz brusquely
that this is a preposterous and es-
sentially unscientific project there is
nothing new about the experiment it-
self  it was first announced nearly twen-
ty years ago in  before the british
association we have been using it ever
since and we know the effect remains
good for periods up to five years linger
- even immensely long - periods are
merely supererogatory

  as for the other aspect of mcelroys
proposal involving the possible future
discovery of moans of time-travel that
seems to me the wildest of unscientific
speculations i dont know how the rest
of you feel but so far as i am concerned
i do not favor lending the resources of

the international association for the ad-
vancement of science to this harebrained
proposition

  kemet ali cleared his throat as chair-
man of the aas his chief asset was his
unfailing tact but before he could be-
gin james mcelroy his earnest eyes
peering through his spectacles spoke up

  may i say just a word  he asked he
was too thin and gray hairs showed al-
ready among the brown his voice still
had the deadened quality it had dis-
played ever since his personal catastro-
phe six months before but there could
be no doubt of the continuing keenness
of mind of this brilliant young geneticist
who had actually become one of the most
valued workers on the iaas staff soon


after he had achieved his phd and scd
simultaneously at the incredibly early
age of twenty-two

  i am quite aware he said that
there is every chance the experiment i
propose will be an utter failure careful
as we should be in the light of previous
experience never to prophesy what sci-
entific discoveries may or may not be
made in the future i agree that prac-
ticable time-travel may well be a chimera
mankind will never bring into actuality

ill

  but i cant see that it will do any
harm to take so simple a chance-and if
it should succeed we shall have proved
at least one point of immense value
which is that for all time to come human-
ity as a species can insure its practical
immortality at least as long as the earth
itself is livable

  i want very little of you-only per-
mission to place my tape-recording in
our innermost vaults and the use of a
very small space in our concession in
startling stories

antarctica i shall be interfering with
nothing and nobody in the little room i
shall take up and if-i say if-a month
from now even one of the persons at
whom my message is aimed should be
able to visit this place and time the re-
sult would in some ways be the most as-
tounding revelation of all scientific his-
tory

   would you expect these-these visit-
ors to give us detailed information about
their own eras asked dr duseldina
moro

   that i doubt very much i think in
the first place they would be unable to do
so lest the actual course of history be
interfered with and in the second place

	doubt if we should be equipped to un-
derstand if they did try to tell us

   but if i standing here a month from
today can secure actual living evidence
that those phials buried in antarctica
can still be used a hundred a thousand
who knows how many thousands of
years in the future-that while civiliza-
tion continues depleted human stock
can always be renewed and regener-
ated-

   exactly interrupted schultz rudely
and what makes you think dr mcei-
roy that you should be chosen as the per-
fect human specimen  why not conduct
first a scrupulous inquiry and select the
young man anywhere on earth whom
we all judge to be mentally and physical-
ly the fittest subject-or several such
men for that matter

tie stopped short sensing the em-
barrassed hush aronnd the confer-
ence table mcelroy stammered i want-
ed to spare expense and labor dr
schultz and i dont consider myself the
perfect human specimen or anything
near it i only felt that for this first ex-
periment it would be better to use some-
one in our own organization as a geneti-
cist i know i carry no serious recessive
defects and-and i felt-

   kemet ali scribbled a hasty note and
passed it down to schultz the biochem-
ist read it and reddened uncomfortably

it said in the chairmans easy american
idiom give the poor guy a break
very well schultz conceded abrupt-
ly  withdraw my opposition perhaps
you are right we can use other subjects
later if this first experiment succeeds
as i dont expect it to he bristled

  his colleagues averted their faces
they had all been remembering as
kemet ali had reminded schultz how
near they had come to losing mcelroy al-
together for a while the psychologists
had feared he would never recover fully
from the shock of that dreadful day
when his adored young wife and their in-
fant son had burned to death before his
eyes

  dr norah wong came to the rescue of
the difficult moment

  i notice she said in her singsong
voice that there is a slight error in your
prospectus dr mcelroy you name the
th of next month for the possible visit
of the-er-the time-travelers-if any
it is the next day we meet the th
young james mcelroy flushed

  i know he mumbled i just wanted
-if you dont mind-i shall of course
make a full recording by tridimens-tele-
screen it will be the same as if you were
all here i shall present it the next day
at the april meeting

   you mean nigel wycliffe put in help-
fully in his precise accent sincfe you
yourself are the-the subject you would
prefer that this first-hypothetical
meeting be made in private

  exactly mcelroy siad gratefully
after all if any of-of the results do
arrive and if they should be odd or-or
unsatisfactory-

  of course dr moro seconded him
of course dr mcelroy does not want
twenty onlookers at this meeting we all
understand

  you have the recording ready
asked the chairman

   all ready just as i read it to you yes-
terday and i have the vials ready too
in glycerol deep freeze as soon as i have
your permission i can fly to antarctica
bury them and mark the spot as i have
the children	

indicated in my instructions

  how many 

  i thought three

  i should make it five said kemet ali
after all there is always the possibility
of one of them being lost or spoiled and
you dont know how many times one may
be used and the results merely added to
the record before the point may be
reached when time-travel is in effect
if it ever is schultz exploded

  if it ever is the chairman responded
blandly i take it ladies and gentlemen
there is no further objection to giving
dr mcelroy unanimous consent  thank
you on april th then we shall hear
his report

  we shall hear that nothing hap-
pened  grumbled the irrepressible
schultz

ii

j n  it was decided that the iaas
headquarters had become obsolete and
inadequate the buildings were all torn
down and the site cleared for an entirely
new construction in the course of de-
molition the innermost vaults were un-
covered a committee of the association
opened the vaults and went over the con-
tents one thing they found was a twen-
tieth century tape-recording apparatus
marked to be opened by any competent
scientist they opened and reproduced
it with mingled feelings of interest and
amusement

  this james mcelroy-ive seen his
name in footnotes now and again-cer-
tainly believed in long-range projects
one of them remarked i wonder if any-
thing happened on april   i
dont suppose they put it in the records
for fear of influencing future develop-
ments

  what shall we do with this thing
inquired one of his colleagues just put
it back in the new vaults to wait for our
forthcoming buildings to fall to ruins in
the course of time

  no i think first we ought to follow

instructions as a duty to the progress
of science

  but we havent achieved time-travel
or any prospect of it

  true but we can do as mcelroy said
-locate one of his phials buried in the
antarctic-at   s   e
near the south magnetic pole and see if
the contents are still viable leave the
rest of them in situ if the thing works
then we add the information at the prop-
er time to mcelroys recording with
data of name place and so on for possi-
ble future discoverers and redeposit the
recorder in our new vaults we shall
have to get official authority of course
suppose nothing happens

  then even so i think we should say
so-though i agree that in that case
there would be little likelihood of any
success later on too bad well never
know the end of the story

  the experiment succeeded and the
record was duly made

  in  during the second dark age
following the last plague and the ter-
minal atomic war the iaas buildings
erected in  lay a mass of ruins on the
shores of the pacific ocean the blasted
earth around them had long lost its
radioactivity but the huge tumbled con-
fusion of steel and stone was a forbidding
and a forbidden place to the roving bands
of illiterate and superstitious hunters
who were the only human beings left
alive in what had been a metropolitan
area when the leader of one of these
groups sighted in his tribes wander-
ings what had become known as the
devils castle he hastily ordered his fol-
lowers to turn in another direction
there was nothing to hunt anyway for
miles around the desolate place unless
one wanted to eat lizards and scorpions

  but rumors and hearsay and legends
grew up and seeped into the ears of chil-
dren listening to stories by the campfire
because the devils castle was terrible
soon it began to take on a fearful fasci-
nation as well curiosity and venture-
someness do not die out of the human
	startling stories

 race decause knowledge is under a cloud
 boys and girls dreamed and egged one
 another on to boasts and dares young
 people restless and bored planned half-
 meant expeditions and forays perhaps
 they told one another somewhere in that
 ruined landmark lay hoards of jewels
 and strange metals such as had been un-
 covered sometimes in the forsaken
 cities to reward a bold invader but time
 would go on and the hunting would be
 bad and need all their energy and the
 young people would grow up and seek
 mates and the children would come and
 then there was no leisure or taste at all
 for adventures into the unknown

a young man named bom was the
one who did finally dare to search the
ruins-all alone in a world where the
only safety and comfort came from close
huddling in ones own native group - he
was a strange young man unpopular
with other youths or with the girls giv-
en to daydreaming by himself when he
should be out hunting for the tribe in-
articulate and dissatisfied-a young man
who a thousand years before or a thou-
sand years after would have been a pio-
neer a searcher a discoverer when
from afar on one of his clans endless
journeyings for food he glimpsed the
devils castle for the first time since
early childhood the urge was too strong
for him to resist he was terribly fright-
ened not least from the difficulties of es-
caping from the band at night when all
the others slept and by the perilous pos-
sibility that after his adventure he
might never be able to find them again
that was a much more real and dreadful
danger than the stories he nevertheless
half-believed of malevolent demons
guarding the hidden treasures

   he escaped unseen and unheard and
dawn found him before the tangled pile
of broken ruins no demons worse than
cold and fog and wind assailed him if
the clan had missed him by now they
would rever follow him here or guess
 that he had come here doubtless they
thouem h w straved too far from the

 sheltering fire and a cougar or bear had
 caught him-these predators were be-
 coming bolder and venturing nearer to
 human camps as the hunters killed off
 more and more of their prey

  valiantly bom set to work to explore
the devils castle his plan had been to
leave when the sun was halfway across
the sky toward the west so as to catch
up with his tribe before night if possible
he burrowed through tunnels and under
heavy stones that balanced menacingly
above his head he scrabbled in the earth
and search roofless rooms crowded with
strange broken objects whose use he
could not even imagine but nowhere
were there jewels or any other treasure
he could use-only twisted pieces of
metal not fit to be fashioned into weap-
ons or shards of glass and hunks of plas-
tic material unusable as ornaments or
tools in his explorations he came upon a
huge underground wall of stone and ce-
ment in the middle of which was a se-
ries of heavy metal dials bom guessed
that this was a sort of door such as he
had seen in houses in the deserted cities
the cement had cracked and it was pos-
sible to tear out pieces of it large enough
to allow him to enter what had been the
inner vaults of the jaas

  it was a complete disappointment
there was nothing inside but shelves
upon shelves of what he did not know
was microfilm and a little metal box with
characters etched on it he could not read
and containing only some unguessable
object he dropped it back where he had
found it

  he had delayed too long in leaving
the sun was setting when he found his
way to the open air again his hands
empty after all his search the hungry
coyotes had begun to gather he fought
hard but they were too many and there
were no tribesmen near to hear his
screams and hurry to his rescue

ill

mn the summer of  an archaeo-
logical expedition under the soonsorshio
the children	

of the university of teheran began exca-
vation in the buried ruins of the iaas
buildings very quickly they became
aware that their speculations based on
philological study of the few remaining
ancient microfilm records were justified
and that this was the remains of some
soil of center ot twentieth century sci-
ence the whole civilized world followed
their progress by telaudioview news
commentators in the international
tongue assured fascinated watchers and
listeners in greenland and china in ar-
gentina and africa-for these local
names were still used to indicate natural
divisions of the world territory-that
this was the greatest archaeological dis-
covery of the age when at last the in-
nermost vault was uncovered and
opened with its priceless store of micro-
film-and an unexplained human skele-
ton lying well preserved not far away-
the commentators chattered like mag-
pies

  but suddenly their descriptions
stopped abruptly and they turned to
other aspects of the expedition

wten jiarduk bal the director-in-
 chief came upon the tape-recording
in its rustless alloy case he sent for the
head philologist to decipher the inscrip-
tion then the recording was fitted to its
primitive transmitter-it was totally un-
adaptable to a modern reproducer-and
harduk bal had it translated by an ex-
pert in twentieth century english

  as soon as he had heard the transla-
tion he got in teletouch with the execu-
tive council of world government the
newly elected world president himself
called harduk bal back after the coun-
cils consultation

  all right go ahead he told the ar-
chaeologist its worth trying long as
it has been even since that additional
record in  but wed better not make
it public till we see if it works we dont
want to have your expedition made a
laughingstock if the experiment should
be a failure as it probably will be tell
your publicity director to cut off further

news till w-eve tried the thing out

   but the time-travel part sir har-
duk bal objected i know the mathema-
ticians keep reporting they have made
progress-theyve been saying that for
fifty years at least-but actually we have
no more time-travel now than they had
in -or in 

   listen harduk bal the president
touched the button which made the con-
versation secret this is for your ears
alone we heard it only last week and
the council is not ready yet tojnake it
public i think i can say confidently that
by the time it would be needed-about
twenty-six years from now-time-travel
will be a demonstrated thing
wonderful really at last

   we hope so were almost sure but
even if were wrong and this new meth-
od is another failure we could still do
the rest of the experiment and add our
statement to the one made in  there
ought to be four vials left and surely be-
fore the last one is used up time-travel
will be a commonplace mode of trans-
portation and future generations if not
we ourselves can take advantage of it-
that is if the stuff is still any good
right sir ill see that the whole
thing is kept quiet until the councils
ready to release it and you i take it
will send somebody to that location in
the antarctic

  immediately do you know harduk
bal i envy the young man or woman
twenty-six years from now who is going
to make that journey back to 

   i do too but im afraid nobody alive
today is qualified chuckled the archae-
ologist by the way he added what
do i do now with the original tape-re-
cording

   youd better sehd it to me ill have
it redeposited in the vaults of world gov-
ernment headquarters in london it
aoesnt matter where it is so long as it s
left for future excavators a thousand oi
so years from now of the site youre ex-
site and i imagine there wont be much
n a place that some far-off day will rn
stitute an archaeological investigation
	startling stories

cavating by the time you get through
with it

  its a sobering thought isnt it our
most elaborate constructions some day
will be ruins just as that scientific cen-
ter of yours is now

  but according to this thing an-
swered harduk bal cheerfully our past
will still be our future even then and
good old mankind will still keep moving
onward and upward and perhaps they
already knew that for sure away back
in 

  in  or  gm kel xza of
the third generation after the great mi-
gration was a candidate for his doctorate
in terraarchaeology at skyros institute
of science as a subject for his thesis he
proposed-as did every other budding
terraarchaeologist-a specimen excava-
tion on the parent planet

  i dont know kel his department
head frowned its too bad that a stu-
dent as promising as you are didnt get
interested in a field with more possibili-
ites-one that hasnt been worked over
until nearly all the good sites have been
excavated long ago in the nostalgic rush
back to earth after wed left it perma-
nently theres still an immense amount
of work to be done on the ancient mar-
tian remains or on those puzzling buried
structures on planet  in alpha centauri
but theres not much worth while left in
the old home except in the dried-up ocean
beds and theyre more rewarding to a
palaeontologist than to an archaeolo-
gist

  theres one site said kel daringly
the last world government center

  the professor shook his hairless head

  now my boy you know thats total-
ly impossible didnt you learn in ele-
mentary school that it was a strict in-
junction of the migration charter that
the london center should be left invio-
late as a symbol of the planetary origin
of man

  of course i learned it-and im not
the only one who thinks its an idiotic su-
perstition unworthy of civilized beings

its worse-there may be important his-
torical material there that we need and
ought to have

  what do you suppose has become of
those buildings after nearly a hundred
years of neglect theyre probably a
heap of weathered rubble by now a fine
symbol

  theyre not overgrown with vegeta-
tion anyhow said the professor grim-
ly considering that the reason we had
to abandon earth in the first place was
the drying up of the surface water and
the consequent death of all vegetation
after the collapse of the moon no per-
haps a thousand years from now when
nobody is alive with even a tradition of
earth as our former home terrarchaeol-
ogy will revive and then no place on
earth may be considered too sacred to
be delved into but not today the in-
terplanetary congress would never give
you a permit

t ook im not going to injure their

   beautiful ruins ive got a specific
thing i want to look for we took away
loads and loads of records from the
world government center when we left
but im certain there is more there of
infinitely greater importance

  see here-listen to this its a stand-
ard text you use in your own classes the
compendium of world surveys by cort
qhw the original plans of the
center included underground impreg-
nable vaults in which world govern-
ments most vital records could be stored
in permanent safety however when the
great migration occurred searchers
found no trace of these vaults under any
government building this does not
mean necessarily that they did not then
or do not now exist the required speed
and enormous magnitude of the migra-
tion operations made it impossible to
make a complete and thorough investiga-
tion unfortunately the setting aside of
the center as a sacred symbolical area
has prevented any further research

  the minute i read those words for
the first time professor i decided to
mil children	

make terrarchaeology mv field and to
be the one to hunt for and discover the
lost vaults of the world government
center and recover whatever they con-
tain with the new supra finders which
did not exist a hundred years ago they
can be located without harming or mov-
ing a stone of the upper buildings

  i know you cant authorize me to go
ahead but will you give me a strong
recommendation of my ability that  can
take to the interplanetary congress
thats all  want the rest is up to me

   the professor gave up

   that much  can do for you lvel and
will very gladly but ill have to add that
i advised you against attempting the
project

  dont worry about that professor
kel smiled impishly i dont suppose it
has occurred to you that this years
chairman of the congress happens to be
mora mrg and that mora -
mrg happens to be my chief guardi-
an ill get a hearing anyway and if i
have your backing im confident of mak-
ing them see the light it would be a
pretty fine medal on the chest to be able
to say that the year you were chairman
the hidden records of world government
were recovered and that the person who
made them available was your own
ward

   six months later kel landed his equip-
ment near the gaunt deserted center
it was another month before the supra
finders located the vaults there was
richness there indeed to be stored in his
contragrav ship and buried among the
records he found a queer inexpressibly
anicent-looking metal box marked in dif-
ficult twentieth century english to be
opened by any competent scientist

  kel under the circumstances-fortu-
nately he even knew the language-
deemed himself sufficiently competent
not to wait till he got the box home to
skyro what he heard as he listened to
the recording sent him headlong to the
ship to telebeam first the professor and
then the congress before he returned
home with his priceless plunder he made

a quick trip to the antarctic where the
ice though much thinner than in earlier
days still provided the only unevapo-
rated water on the surface of the rav-
aged planet continuing deep freeze
was easy in the contragrav

  by kels time travel to the past was
as commonplace as space-travel he was
strongly tempted to go back to april 
 himself to take a look at the re-
markable james mcelroy-say an hour
or so before mcelroys appointed meet-
ing with somebody yet unborn when kel
would have made his journey but young
and romantic as he was kel xza
was also a responsible scientific worker
and so he handed over the tape-record-
ing and the vial to the proper authorities
to let them conduct the experiment
while he buried himself in the other ma-
terial he had found in the centers vaults
to prepare what eventually became the
most famous thesis ever presented by a
candidate for the degree of terd

  the gray parched earth grew ever
more desolate as the centuries rolled
over it the antarctic ice dissolved inch
by inch then evaporated in the unoxy-
genated air the two vials left lay finally
on bare rock

  soon under the suns radiation their
contents died at last

g ord fen stood for a mo-
ment at the entrance to the grounds of
the iaas center this was the right
place and of course there could be no
question as to the exact time it was five
minutes to three oclock on the afternoon
of saturday april   unaccus-
tomed emotions swept him-puzzlement
curiosity frustration and a sense of
anticlimax in a way his entire twenty-
five years of life had led up to this mo-
ment  when it was over ana he was back
again in his own time and place he
would have to begin some entirely new
career with his reason for living hither-
to no longer in existence

he was carefully dressed in the prop-
	startling stories

er clothing for a young man of the twen-
tieth century and in the jacket he found
a pocket into which he could insert the
tiny apparatus that would insure his safe
return home he had been just as care-
fully schooled in the english of the pe-
riod in its american version except for
the wig to simulate twentieth century
hair he looked like any tall handsome
youth of 

  what interested him more than this
james mcelroy to whom he had been dis-
patched more even than the solution of
all the vague hints and allusions he had
heard since childhood was the landscape
around him at home there were no great
bodies of untamed water like this there
were hills far higher than this one on
whose summit he stood now but they
were not planted with grass and trees
indeed he suspected from the proximity
of the site to the ocean below him that
all this verdure had been cultivated by
man and that the natural aspect of the
hill would be that of a sand dune he
knew of course the geography of his
lofeation he was on a flat-topped hill
averlooking the pacific ocean in a por-
tion of earth once known interchange-
ably it seemed as the united states of
america and california

  as he tore his gaze reluctantly away
from the view-who knew how much
time he would have for sightseeing when
he left and it might well be dark then as
well-and prepared to turn it in at the
gate in the massive brick wall he saw a
girl walking slowly up the path trun-
dling some kind of machine as he
watched she paused at a thick clump of
bushes and pushed the machine inside
arranging twigs and branches elaborate-
ly so as to conceal it from any passer-by
gords eyes lighted up with interest in
the second before she hid the thing he
had recognized it as a primitive time-
travel equipment such as he had seen in
museums at home deliberately he wait-
id until the girl caught up with him

  excuse me she said in twentieth
entury english that had exactly the
same slight stiffness as his own but is

this the headquarters of the internation-
al association for the advancement of
science 

   gord smiled

   what is your century he asked
she jumped and stared at him with
long heavily fringed dark eyes

  the-the forty-first she stam-
mered how did you know are you-
i am from long after you-almost as
long as you are after the time we find
ourselves in now i take it that you too
have been sent to see a man named james
mcelroy

   why yes all my life-

all mine too lets go in together
whats it all about do you know
no more than you perhaps we shall
find out now what is your own lan-
guage

   interlingua and yours

  a modified interlingua too but i
doubt if youd understand mine or i
yours lets stick to this one since weve
both learned it well

  my name is wia rustum she held
out her hand but gord did not take it
people of his time seldom touched one
another casually he noticed however
that the little finger was complete-
doubtless her little toes too-not rudi-
mentary as his were that he had been
taught was the only physical change in
mankind in the past four thousand years
unless one counted the loss of head-hair
before adolescence or the increasing
number of babies born without a vermi-
form appendix

   call me gord he said the rest of
it is just for official identification

   he noticed with approval that her per-
ceptions were sensitive she had with-
drawn her hand swiftly the instant she
received no answering gesture from him
she did not seem pretty to gord despite
her chiseled features and her smooth
light-bronze skin through which the
warm blood showed her lustrous black
hair arranged in some strange fashion
which he presumed must be that of wom-
en of the time they were visiting re-
pelled him obviouslv she was of dure
the children	

earth descent there was no trace in her
of any off-planetary mixture

  they had reached the group of white
stone buildings this one in the middle
is probably the main structure gord re-
marked we can go in there and ask
for this james mcelroy

  a small door in an l-shaped wing
opened abruptly and a young man of
about their own age stood framed in the
doorway he peered out at them anx-
iously

tve are looking for a man named
w james mcelroy wia rustum
told him

  i am mcelroy the mans voice
shook with excitement are you-
yes said gord gravely it seems
that we have both been sent to visit you
come in come in

  he beckoned them into a room that re-
minded wia of reconstructions of primi-
tive architecture she had seen-a sort of
ancient office with a desk and filing cabi-
nets and chairs to which mcelroy waved
them fussily they sat down gingerly
but the chairs were more comfortable in
spite of their odd shape than either of
them had expected

  you wont mind will you said mc-
elroy if i make a record of our conver-
sation 

  of course not wia answered polite-
ly gord only nodded perplexed in his
experience records were always kept of
all conversations however trivial
though he wondered how the primitive
machine standing against an inner wall
was expected to work

  their host sat down at his desk he
seemed hardly to know how to begin

  are you all that are coming he
blurted

  all gord echoed i know only
that i myself was sent to you i met this
young woman just outside here and it
appears that she too has been sent
then youre not both from the same
approximate time

  gord laughed

  hardly i am as far from her in time

as she is from you you should see the
obsolete object she traveled here on and
has hidden in your grounds its a won-
der to me that she could travel ten years
back in that thing

  wia rustum flushed

   its a very fine traveler she said de-
fensively why its an enormous im-
provement on the first ones only twenty-
odd years ago

   gord felt the pocket-sized traveler in
his jacket and concealed his smile

  mcelroy was watching them intently
his hands were shaking in some almost
unbearable agitation but he was getting
better control of his voice

  you must both be utterly bewil-
dered he said unless you have been
told all about this 

  they both shook their heads

  all i know said wia is that ever
since i can remember i have been told
that on my twenty-fifth birthday i was
to make a journey back to  to see a
man named james mcelroy at the inter-
national association for the advance-
ment of science

  i also-at these headquarters on
earth gord agreed the guardians
said that was why i had to learn to speak
twentieth century american english
and study your history and geography
and customs though i was not in train-
ing to be a terrarchaeologist i had les-
sons with kel xza himself he
added proudly

  i dont know about any guardians
said wia rustum but i had a special
world government council scholarship
right through school and the famous
harduk bal who excavated this very
site in  gave me my final instruc-
tions only a week ago

  in  mcelroy exclaimed and
what year is it now in your time
why  of course

  and in yours he asked turning to
gord

  this is year  gm-of the great
migration-or according to your calen-
dar i suppose it would be 
startling stories

m

     lcelroy gaped at them he seemed
overwhelmed in a dazed tone he
said to wia and you say time-travel
was discovered only in your own life-
time

  the first short trips were made in


  i see so any earlier-tell me has
either of you any message for me from
a time earlier than your own probably
you young lady-good heavens i
havent asked either of you your name
i am wia rustum you may call me
wia james yes i was told to say-but
maybe gord has a message too

  gord fen the young man in-
troduced himself belatedly call me just
gord yes i was given a message also
but i was told it would be unnecessary
if any traveler from an earlier era should
be at the meeting was yours about
somebody named mark iverson he
asked wia

   yes it must be the same

   you give it then

   with the air of one repeating a lesson
learned by rote the girl recited

   in  a committee of the iaas in
charge of tearing down the old buildings
and erecting new ones discovered the
tape-recording and followed instructions
mark iverson was born the following
february means of travel into the past
had not yet been discovered and so it
was merely added to the record that this
child was born but that he died at the
age of five when a moon-plane on which
he was a passenger was destroyed
in a collision with a meteor

  james mcelroy closed his eyes for a
moment his face was white

  another he muttered little jim
-and adela-and now this child

  he took a deep breath

  tell me he asked wia did your
message say if the childs mother was
with him-and who she was 

  how would anyone know that  gord
-interrupted oh yes of course-in that
age-

  no said wia that is all i was
taught to say and i havent the slightest
idea what it means did you have more
than that in your message gord 

  it was just the same but i do re-
member once asking kel what tape-re-
cording they were referring to and he
said it was one he found in the old world
government center in london here on
earth and that it was now safe in the
archives of the interplanetary congress
on skyro

  at this moment it is in the vaults
under the iaas buildings right here
said mcelroy the color was coming
back to his face i wonder how much it
has wandered up to your time gord-
and where it will wander afterwards

  so now three vials are accounted for
and the other two must have been lost or
useless or else i would either have more
visitors today than you two or your mes-
sage would be longer

  i know im trying your patience
none of this can make sense to you
please bear with me just a little longer
and then ill explain as well as i can i
dont suppose he added wistfully that
either of you could tell me anything in
detail about life as you know it in your
respective times no dont bother to an-
swer i told my colleagues only last
month why that would logically be quite
impossible

  but perhaps you can satisfy me on
one point i noticed wia when you gave
your message that you spoke of travel
into the past does that mean that time-
travel is all one-directional oant you
go forward into the future

  wia looked at gord we cant she
said can you 

  no and i doubt if men ever will i
could tell you why-its elementary
mathematics but unless youre familiar
with the moitier concept discovered in
your year -

  and the gregi correlary of 
wia added

  mcelroy smiled

  im not a mathematician he said
and even if i were- he shrugged
the children	

well that question was for the bene-
fit of my colleagues particularly of my
friend wycliffe  imagine id get the
same kind of answer if i queried you
about moros specialty or schultzs or
wongs or kemet alis or any of the
others we cant change history by al-
tering the past though i do wonder why
there was so long a gap between mark
iversons birth and yours wia

  well of course the second dark age
came in between-

  better not wia gord warned her
i know what the interplanetary con-
gress would do to me if i tried to scram-
ble up history by leaking it into the
past

  wia looked frightened

  dont worry wia mcelroy said re-
assuringly you havent said anything
that could do any harm we in  have
been prepared for a quarter of a century
for the onset of some such interregnum
in fact weve expected it much sooner
than apparently it will arrive and plen-
ty of us also have the faith that civiliza-
tion will revive and go on to greater
heights you and gord are both evidence
of that-in more ways than you know

  now if i may ask you both just a few
more questions ill solve the whole riddle
for you you gord can you tell me
about your mother

umy mother gord knit his
brows how would i know about
that  im just like everybody else i was
produced in my local genitorium and
reared in mv local pedenid how would i
know which particular ovum gestated
me any more than i would know which
particular sperm-cell activated it  all i
know is that i must have a bit of native
martian heredity since i have superex-
pansible lungs and the martian stigmata
on my spine

  i see said james mcelroy slowly
gazing at the young man with a sort of
baffled wonder so in your time all chil-
dren are laboratory products are they 
no haphazard breeding-the geneticists
dream come true dont you have any

 sex life at all 

   gord reddened angrily

   naturally i have he said in an
 offended tone im twenty-five years
 old today im a perfectly normal human
 being ive belonged to a sex group
 since i was eighteen like any other man
 but you cant mix up sex and reproduc-
 tion it isnt civilized

   we do mcelroy answered dryly

 and you wia did you come out of a
 test-tube too

    as a matter of fact i did said wia
 looking surprised how did you know
 i mean my mother was one of those
 selected for controlled eugenic mater-
 nity by the biogenetics laboratory but
 naturally  know who she is-in fact
 she reared me until i formed my first
 love-union and i never was sent to a
 nursery i live near her now and i see
 her often i said goodbye to her just
 before i left on this time-journey

   but i do agree with gord on one
 thing i dont want to be rude but it
 does seem terribly dangerous and rather
 disgusting to let just any woman have
 a child by any man we dont do that
 even in direct parentage how do you
 know they have the right kind of hered-
 ity

   we dont said mcelroy mildly im
 a geneticist myself wia of an antique
 variety im not denying that our sci-
 ence and our culture are far behind
 yours as far perhaps-a bit of malice
 spiced his tone-as yours may be be-
 hind gords here but lets not wrangle
 over our comparative social mores tell
 me about your mother what is her
 descent for instance of what nation-
 ality is she

   it was wias turn to flush in anger
 her dark eyes flashed

   if youre implying she retorted
 that im a monogene its an outrageous
 lie if youre any kind of geneticist
 james mcelroy you know perfectly well
 that one cant parcel out the chromo-
 somes like so many building-blocks i
 may display more of the characteristics
 of one of the ancient races-the one
	startling stories

 they called white i suppose to which
 you seem to belong-than of the others
 but i can assure you that whoever my
 father may have ben-and that of
 course i cant know-my mother has
 her class a certificate attesting that her
 ancestry includes every one of the civ-
 ilized types of mankind

  didnt they teach you about this age
were in now wia gord intervened
sarcastically in this era they favored
monogenes you were penalized if you
had even a trace of interracial heredity
i cant imagine what they would have
done about my trace of martian-ex-
cept that they hadnt even reached mars
yet

  no the moons as far as weve at-
tained to said mcelroy placatingly
and please believe me wia i didnt
mean my question in a derogatory way
im-id like to know a lot about your
mother-id like to know about gords
if he could tell me because-

  oh lord let me try to tell this in
the simplest way i can

  in august  at a meeting of
the british association for the advance-
ment of science-there were still sepa-
rate national associations then instead
of one international as now-a dr
parkes reported on a new method of
freezing germ-cells by the use of glyc-
erol the cells were quick-frozen to
minus  centigrade and though crys-
tals formed the glycerol crystals did
not crush the cells as those of other
freezing media had done in conse-
quence less than ten per cent of the cells
died and the rest retained vitality and
fertility for an indefinite time so long
as they were kept at the same tempera-
ture do you follow me

  of course answered wia we em-
ploy a more refined technique of the
same sort it is used to preserve the
sperm of superior and distinguished
men to be used as sires for eugenic
maternity in fact she added with an
embarrassed laugh i have always
dreamed that i myself-

  mcelroy looked embarrassed too

  and you gord he asked

  we have a much better method but
naturally i understand what you mean

  well we too began to employ this
method experimentally soon after it was
announced and it worked but we had
used it only for short-time experiments
and mostly with animals

vi

clford glanced inquiringly at wia
dont you remember she whispered
in this time they still had all kinds of
living animals besides man-natural
ones not synthetics oh yes id for-
gotten he said mcelroy went on

  where i differed from the others was
in the fact that i believed firmly in the
ultimate discovery of time-travel with-
out that naturally there was not much
point in conducting experiments which
would extend beyond the probable span
of the lives of the experimenters i dont
know exactly what your life-expectancy
is-

  about a hundred years said wia

  somewhere around  said gord

  ours today is in the late seventies

   but i reasoned if the cells could be
kept frozen for hundreds or even thou-
sands of years and if meanwhile time-
travel into the past could be discovered
then it would be possible to prove the
practical immortality of the human race
there were other important scientific
correlaries too but this alone justified
trying it

  but how could you keep up a tem-
perature of minus  centigrade-we
dont use that scale but i gather that it
is very cold-long after the people who
first prepared the cells were dead and
gone gord asked

  in the antarctic continent the
ia as had a concession there where
vials of sperm could be deeply buried
and the site marked it will be countless
centuries before that ice will begin to
melt i made a tape-recording with full
instructions and placed it in our vaults
here if it were found before time-
the children	n

travel then the results of the experi-
ment were simply to be added to the
recording my idea was that eventually
as the ages passed these buildings would
fall into ruins and some day the vaults
would be found and opened

   i find from your message wia that
actually the first time the recording was
reproduced was less than two hundred
years from now-i hadnt thought of
our headquarters becoming obsolete
and being rebuilt but obviously after
that somebody did find the recording in
the ruins of those new buildings and
you gord said that in your day it was
found in london and is now on some
planet outside the solar system

  are you beginning to understand
  wia found her voice first

  you mean we-

  you two-and mark iverson

  there was a stunned pause then
gord said tautly

   will you be so good james mcelroy
as to describe to us the men whose
sperm-cells were in those vials

   there was only one man answered
mcelroy almost inaudibly

  but then wia exclaimed that
must mean-gord you and i must be
half-brother and sister and that little
boy back in the twenty-second century
-he was our half-brother too

  yes-you see i- mcelroy began
gord interrupted him his face white
with rage

   how could you he cried hoarsely
how could you upset our entire genetic
pattern on which our civilization and
even our continuing existence are based 
we dont indulge in slapdash parenthood
the way you people did back in your
barbaric age our births are all care-
fully calculated to produce just the
right number of each type of body-mind
needed to maintain a balanced economy
with all the completely unknowable
characteristics of a haphazard man of
your era how can the resulting child be
sure of its abilities and potentialities
his voice shook and his face was a
mask of fury and despair

tivou did that to me and my
own people let it happen to me my
own guardians knew-theyve always
known-that i was a freak for the
sake of some frivolous bit of scientific
knowledge they let me be created a dif-
ferent being from anybody else in the
world they trained me for this idiotic
journey back in time so that i might
hear from your own lips just what you
had done to me

  and now i am to go back home my
purpose fulfilled and what is my life
to be from now on  how is anyone ever
to know what i am best fitted for what
my place is in society

  i dont know what your future will
be like wia rustum he turned sav-
agely on the girl who stared at him wide-
eyed her dark face bloodless we
arent concerned with brothers or sis-
ters for all i know any girl in my sex
group might be my sister though its
not likely-and what would it matter
none of us is ever born except from a
regulated union of ova and sperm and
only the best of us are ever selected to
contribute our own cells for reproduc-
tion

  none of us but me he concluded
bitterly he jumped to his feet and
glared at mcelroy

  but i- mcelroy began weakly
gord snarled at him

   i congratulate you on the success of
your experiment i cant wait any longer
to find out what plans my chief guardi-
an has for me next

  he put his hand in his pocket and
pressed a trigger

  the next instant mcelroy and wia
rustum were alone in the room

   mcelroy buried his face in his hands
a soft hand touched his shoulder he
looked up at wias compassionate face

  dont feel bad she murmured i
know you didnt mean any harm theyll
calm him down surely if their culture
is so advanced they wouldnt have let
him be produced only as a-

  an experimental animal his tone
was as bitter as gords had been
	startling stories

   i suppose so theyll fit him into the
normal life of their time im certain of
it

  mcelroy shook his head

  and what about you wia

  dont worry about me theyve al-
ways told me that after what they spoke
of as my twenty-fifth birthday project
i could go on quietly with my own life
and my own work i have a very good
job with the council of world govern-
ment she said proudly

  and arent you too horrified at the
thought that your father is one of us
twentieth century barbarians

  it is an upsetting thought she re-
plied frankly but youve told us you
are a geneticist and primitive as genet-
ics must be in your time im confident
you wouldnt have used cells in your
experiment that came from a defective
man

  her voice grew coaxing

   dont suppose you could tell me
could you really were not nearly so
fussy as gords people seem to be
naturally we dont let just anybody
who wants to have children but lots
of women have them by men they actu-
ally know-if they can get certificates
on both sides they often have them by
their own love-partners her face fell
in fact tir and  were planning-well
now of course well have to give that
up i see i could never be certified

  so ive ruined your life too by my
rash experimentation have i
nonsense said wia stoutly i dont
live in a one-track world like my dear
half-brother ive got tir and my work
and plenty of other interests

  but just the same i wish you would
tell me id promise never to let my
mother find out women who are chosen
for eugenic maternity would always
rather not know

  tell you what wia

  who my father was of course
mcelroys face was a study before
he could find words wia forestalled him

  oh great radiation how stupid of
me of course i see it all now if only

that silly gord had waited till you could
make him understand

  im afraid i dont understand you
myself my dear

  certainly you do you dont need to
pretend im not always as dense as i
must have seemed just now naturally
for a momentous project like that there
was only one thing you could have done

tames mcelroys heart which had
j ached for seven months suddenly
throbbed with joy he smiled at his
daughter who in this strange meeting
was of exactly his own age

  then you dont mind wia

  mind i should have known i could
trust you the idea of gords saying
that you had made a freak of him did
he think you picked out just anybody at
random to become our father it must
have taken you months or years to de-
cide on the man with the very finest
mind and the best body alive in your
time whom else could you have chosen
with the very lives of future beings at
stake

  thats all i need to know about my
father im not interested in his race or
nationality or whatever you call it or
his age or what he looked like that hot-
headed gord he got himself so wrought
up i honestly think hed have believed
any silly balderdash you told him wia
laughed merrily why she went on
wiping her eyes he probably would
have believed you if youd told him the
most ridiculous thing you could think of
-even that you yourself were the man
her eyes were mirrors of innocent
candor

  then you wouldnt consider me a-
a good eugenic specimen wia mcel-
roy asked painfully

   wia sobered contritely

  oh dear she apologized that
wasnt very polite was it but really
james dont you have mirrors in your
era you seem about the same age as
gord and i are yet even with your
smaller life-expectancy i can see that
youre going to be prematurely old why
the children	

look there are grey hairs at your tem-
ples and you seem unable to see with-
out that glass thing across your eyes
besides  noticed right away how un-
stable you are emotionally

  im sure she added courteously
that you have a fine mind you must
have to have thought of this whole thing
fn your primitive era and you must
be forward-looking or you wouldnt have
believed in time-travel when other peo-
ple didnt i like you very much but
naturally as a geneticist yourself you
would hardly select yourself as the best
possible ancestor for anybody would
you

  mcelrqy smiled with stiff lips

  youre very perspicacious my dear
i hope you wont ever regret the father
i did pick out for you

  i shant and dont worry about
gord either hell get over his shock
anyway neither of us will ever have
children of our own now and that
other little boy-mark iverson-died
when he was five so the line ends with
us and you can set your mind at rest

  she took mcelroys cold hand in her
warm one

  paternity means a lot to people in
your time doesnt it she said sym-
pathetically more than it does in ours
-or maternity either-and much more
evidently than it does in gords

  look james i know how youre
feeling you must feel responsible for
our existence gords and mine almost
as if you really were our father dont
well get along all right

  do you know what i think you ought
to do i think you ought to have a child
of your own im sure youre as good a
potential ancestor as lots of people of
your time and any defects you trans-

mitted would be diluted out in the gen-
erations after you have you any chil-
dren already

  i had-i had a son-but he was
killed

  like poor little mark iverson well
have another

  his mother was killed with him we
-i loved her very much

  oh im sorry but even so-oh i
forgot you people are sort of monog-
amists arent you

  sort of to his surprise mcelroy
found himself smiling faintly

  then perhaps-dont you think you
might find someone else you would want
to have a child by im afraid thats a
clumsy way to put it your customs are
so unfamiliar to me but i do feel youre
the kind of man who ought to marry-
isnt that the word -and have sons and
daughters of your own again

  you may be right wia i hadnt
thought of it that way thank you for
coming today i feel my whole experi-
ment was justified by its producing
you

  what a nice thing to say ive liked
meeting you too james i dont expect
theyll want me to come to see you again
but ill never forget you neither will
gord and think about what i said
wont you why just think if you take
my advice today i may know some re-
mote descendant of yours myself

  he took her hand

  goodbye wia i promise you ill
think about it

  he stood at the door and watched
his daughter stride across the lawn to
the bushes where her time-travel ma-
chine was hidden there were tears in
his eyes but his heart was strangely
light

       now in preparation - the big  edition of

                    continued from page 

reply wrote out its instructions to take the num-
ber of marbles it had decided upon from the
group it had selected in about four moves it
was obvious the machine had won and it won
all the rest of the games

  it is entirely possible for a human to win
dr lubkin explained but in order to do so
he must start by making a correct first move
and then he must make every following move
correctly he cannot afford to make a single
mistake because the moment he does he has lost
the game -the machine makes no mistakes
we had a question in a game with so many
combinations there must be more than one cor-
rect choice at many points how does the ma-
chine choose the one move it will make

does it think

                                                      

  well we got an answer but we went down
for the third time about halfway through it and
the best we can do is to reproduce the essence
of it aswe remember

  the machine computes all the possible com-
binations for every move dr lubkin ex-
plained he was very nonchalant about the fact
that there are so many thousands of combina-
tions that it staggers the imagination and that
the machine does all his computation in about
three seconds where several choices are pos-
sible it is quite capable of selecting the one
which seems the most direct route to its goal
isnt that thinking we asked

  no it looks like thinking but it is not it
is computation not thought

  having built it he should know but feats of
computation amazing facility in adding or cal-
culating-this we expect from a machine none
of this seared us so much as the sight of it play-
ing a game with a human opponent watching
tli lights scamper over the panel listening to
the typewriter clack out its instructions we
found it impossible to fight down the thought of
a huge and powerful brain lurking behind the
steel doors it was just a little bit chilling

built-in memory

  later over corned beef sandwiches and cokes
we cornered dr lubkin and made like a fan
the publicity we reminded him says that
the machine has a memory of  words of

nine decimal digits each how do you build
memory into a machine

simple enough he said if you send an
electrical impulse of a certain pattern through
a wire it passes through and is gone but sup-
pose you send another through on the heels of
the first and another and another-continuously
suppose you bring your wire around and make
a complete circuit out of it and keep this im-
pulse going through it continuously you might
say then that the pattern exists simultaneously
all through that circuit this is equivalent to
memory any new impulse coming through
must then be matched to ttiat existing impulse
which can recall it by accepting or rejecting
it

that much we could understand at least in
theory

could the machine be taught to use words
instead of numbers

easily as it is already using some words
but it would have to be a very basic basic eng-
lish for most of our words have about nine dif-
ferent meanings and the machine would not be
able to hedge-hop among them like a human it
would have one fixed interpretation for each
word

the  question

then we asked the  question dr lub-
kin science-fiction writers carrying the con-
ception of these machines on into their future
development depict them as having achieved
actual consciousness do you think they will 

no lie said promptly they compute they
dont reason i dont see how they can develop
consciousncss

think or not elecom  the first of its type
is on its way to aberdeen proving grounds
having been purchased by the army to solve
problems related to fire control in artillery a
mathematically inclined lieutenant from the
army was present at the demonstration to ex-
plain the armys interest in the machine it is
just big enough to handle certain problems
which are not vital enough to join the waiting
list for the really big computers but are too
much for human mathematicians to spend
months over doing the required computations

an improved model  is now being assem-
bled and special designs to handle specific office

problems for business such as magazine circula-
tion will be available the price a mere


  will elecom do everything the big machines
will do dr lubkin was asked

  yes but slower thats why the really big
jobs will wait for the big calculators but the
waiting list is months long this one will han-
dle the medium jobs which wouldnt get to the
big machines

  we emerged from brooklyn feeling that we
had had a foot inside the door of a world hither-
to described only in our own magazines these
men we had been talking to were not writers or
science-fiction fans they were hard-headed

and vitamins

by peggy lindemann

  dear mr mines im slightly astonished that
anyone should be astonished to read that the rich
get richer and the poor get-children

    menninger suggested that it might be the emo-
tional satisfaction which the having of progeny
gives to the unsuccessful durham points out in
man against -myth tuat most social myths are
arguments either that the status quo is desirable
or that it is unavoidable and gives as one instance
the frequency to which allusions are made to the
tooth and claw methods of preservations by species
and the not so often quoted but obviously com-
moner mode widespread method of prolificacy

is this a word do you think it possible that
all species of animals tend to have larger families
when they are underfed has anyone ever tested
the possibility

  i think mrs colby a bit wrong in saying that
religious people-does she mean only catholics-
have large families because of fear of their re-
ligious mentors these people believe that arti-
ficial methods of birth control are displeasing to
god i suppose it would be heavy as stealing on
their consciences although i have heard many
religious young women after their first few chil-
dren decide that one or another means is ethical
enough

   people also seem to have the peculiar notion tha
hungry people are dangerous now a man who is
used to eating reasonable-sized meals may be dan-
gerous when he doesnt get them but if there are
any cases in the history books of underfed peoples
engaging in wars i just havent heard of them

  there are the japanese but war does not now
seem so natural to them as to the germans-at
least the germans seem to have had a little more
choice of leadership

  of course it has been only a short time that
man has tried to use the scientific method to study
himself to me it seems that anthropology has
taught us more than psychology or sociology but
that as in other studies what man learns about
man sliould increase by an upward spiral i am
sure that a few hundred years from now no par-
ents will be allowed to whip their children that
no parents will be allowed to take the consequences
of their childrens misdeeds-but how to keeo them
from killing themselves-that children will be
reared in almost child-proof environments so that
they are unable to kill themselves accidentally it
seems likely too that children will be allowed to
visit relatives or friends indefinitely at will also
that educational methods will be far far differ-
ent and that democracy may spread to the con-
duct of business as well as schools

   i think it possible that marriages will have to
be renewed by proof of compatibility and that
married couples who do not seem to be happy with
each other will have to agree to psychological re-
conditioning-that marriages will be difficult as
divorce is easy although i rather think marriage
is here to stay and that divorce will be less fre- x
quent than it is now because men and women will
be more friendly with each other

   and i feel sure as sure that science will find
some faster than light transportation with no feel-
ing of acceleration no more than we feel from
the earths without having to double talk for ein-
stein-seaside oregon

  deleted was four pages of a slashing attack
on the mythology of theology-lets keep it clean
but orchids to you peggy lindemann for the
first original idea of the decade it should be
made difficult to stay married we agree with
you just as the state of new jersey requires
all motor cars to be checked twice a year for
safety marriages should be checked even year
or so and if people are not getting along they
should be reconditioned or forcibly separated

hunger and such

by richard harter

  dear sam what are you trying to do-be the
best mag on the market such issues as the august
and september ones make you definitely the leader

in sf

  some of your readers doubted that hunger
caused overpopulation the book geography of
hunger deals with this subject in it somewhere
is a list of nations their birthrates and their pro-
tein consumption as the protein consumption goes
up the birthrate goes down and vice versa

  also after a careful study of the distribution of
population you could make the claim that every
nation in the world is underpopulated take
china for example it is an a example of a mal-
distributed population in certain areas it has the
highest population concentrate on earth yet most
of china is practically an unsettled land

  the reason of course is a cultural one usually
the eulture is set so that it only intensifies the
hunger thus regardless of how few people there
arc and how much land there is they will starve
starving in the midst of plenty they call it-
lluihmnre s dakota

  credit an assist from larter-this is exactly
what we said in otir editorial which inciden-
tally seemed like a fiirly important piece of in-
formation to us hut has caused no earth-shaking
reactions that weve been able to discover so far

energetically yours

by wally parsons

  dear sam i just started to reread tev aug-
ust when i came upon a letter by r w durham
i think your explanation of the rocket principle
will still leave him somewhat confused you ne-
glected his idea of a sucking action of a vacuum
so i shall explain ahem

  energy flows from a high potential to a low
potential if the two potentials are connected by a
suitable conductor witness the effcct of joining
the terminals of a dry cell with a piece of copper
or raise a twenty pound body through ten feet
yju exert two hundred foot-pounds of energy
release the body and it will release the two hun-
dred foot pounds of potential energy in falling to
its former position

  expanding gasses leave a rocket tube because
they have greater pressure than the surrounding
pressure in space this is zero thus you have
your action and reaction sets in try this take
a u-shaped glass tube hollow open at both ends
each arm separated by a valve fill each arm
party with water to a different level open the
vv e and observe you will see the pressure in
each arm equalizing-high potential in one arm
low potential in the other thats why the vacuum
doesnt nullify the effect of expanding gasses

  since this is not one of my usual six-page let-
ters maybe it will see print eh anyway i thought
id show off ray third form physics a little-
spruithill rd toronto ontario

  so a seven page letter heads for the waste-
paper basket how manyd you send in this
month-three or -four thanks for the erudi-
tion only nobody asked yon why the gasses
con out the rear end of the rocket they asked
you howcome they push when theres nothing
to push against

seibel for all

by ken m butland ii

  dear sam ed and all other editors this is
to inform you that your cause is lost forgotten
buried and cremated ive decided to join forces
with the snarler who ain i  nobody yet but
with the huh what a handwriting-ed on my
side how can i miss

  this boy seibel is on the ball im sure you
agree with me

  well i must retire now and start thinking up
irks for you iiext month goo-by- quoit st
doumey cal 

  sure agree with you that hes on the ball-
the trouble is its the wrong ball alpha cen-
tauri would be about right wait-what is this
two letters from the snarler himself hes in
the navy the mood seized him one day so
he up and enlisted somebody better tip off the
brass before the whole seafaring establishment
is disorganized anyway he writes to rave
about the lovers your very first baby

rave snarly saying quote if youd pub-
lished stories like this before you wouldnt have
had nasty old me flagellating you half to life
gadzooks imagine our embarrassment at being
forced into the position of having to agree with
him

anchors aweigh

by snarly sabretooth seibel

  dear slice i happened to wander across one
of your favorite magazines while i was in the big
city of oklahoma city this weekend what ocean
is that on-ed purely accidental you under-
stand i didnt go in search of a bookstore enter
and dig around in their copious pikes of literature
for the sole purpose of reading the october issue
of startling

  i see i am being received with enthusiastic ap-
plause by the admiring hoards gifts are being
cast at my feet i have a new - rifle in a short
time i can start a lead mine on the land behind
me they wout all miss-ed and soon i can
build me a mansion of bricks i feel flattered that
my name was mentioned far more in your maga-
zine than any other name

  now of course i cant please everyone a small
few but yet notable contributed their irritated re-
plies to my letter first of all what business is it
of yours what i say the letters are to sam and
if he sees fit to print them is it necessary for you
to have a fit i met no arguments only anger i
cannot reply to anger for there is no reason behind
it and i am a reasonable man

  a womans being unreasonable and pitifully il-
logical and emotional i can well understand its
an inherent weakness of their sex just as much
as their enjoyment over their prowess at captivating
hapless males but a mans beinsr so i cannot under-
stand and therefore their reaction and behaviour
is a reprehensible thing that they should fall to a
chattering mindless womans level

  ah but do not misunderstand me i am far from
being a misogynist there is no pleasure greater
to me than a womans company-but only if she is
a woman and not a scatterbrained child perhaps
you will press the point as a contradiction but a
look at facts will prove such thinking false i will
not give you those facts if you do not know them
then you are sexless and therefore do not need
them nor are interested huh-ed

  it is a waste of time to tell a fool facts because
he or she will ignore them and continue on an
erratic course i have dwelled too long on a
subject boring to me and that is overlong amen-
ed

  what was that about me defecating a ream of
white paper and offering it for public consump-
tion i know better than to send you any stories
you give me too much credit then for  accept
the challenge i can outwrite any author except
kris neville and why dont you have him write
a story for you i shall begin and we shall see
what public reaction is all you have o do is
publish it if you have the nerve

  reading your editorial it smacks in a few thou-
sand places of sidelong jokes at me mind now
its all only conjectures i know i know har-
monize if the shoe fits wear it
	startling stories

  i am in the process of reading asylum
earth-youre sure this creature can write he
isnt a ubangi eunuch you dug up on one of your
vacations is he he doesnt seem to understand
all he knows about the love scene was about as
interesting as the copulation of two oysters on
your dinner plate yet if youre going to have
sex in your stories at least put a little more real-
ism in it here seibel goes clinical navy influ-
ence-ed

  what i want in women is rather rare in fact ive
never met the full combination except in a painting
so i while away my life by suffering chasing
women 

  come to think of it sam ill bet more people
like me than dont usually the people who have
a peeve are the ones who write in while those who
are satisfied feel no need to do so  believe there
were two who approved of me i thank you sirs
you are gentlemen and i am your friend and
dont say youd hate to have me for a friend
sam took the words right out of our mouth-
ed

  you have a nice cover on this issue sam just
keep it up and someday itll crecp all through
your magazine when it does ill read it from cover
to cover very neatly portrayed appealing to intel-
ligence now do it for the stories instead of leav-
ing them on a putrescent level of sub-human de-
cadency

   shall write that story and youll willingly buy

it

  so steinbeck is nauseating depraved and
mad in his portrayal of people a mind locked
behind doors must have said that i know the
people he wrote about and thats the way people
are try to disprove me-po box  olivc-
hursl calif

  howd they ever pass this kid for the navy
they must be trying to lose the cold war now
lies not only got practically all of the men sore
at him but hes added all the women whats
the old adage about judging a man by the en-
emies hes made with seibel that includes just
about everybody except ken butland and
probably not even him very long still we gotta
admit we like seibel ourselves its hi modesty

heroes and vat 

by dick clarkson

  dear sam where was seibel you didnt
have a letter by him in the oct ish of ss now
id grown right fond of that bhoy  in a tear-his-
throat-out sort of way now i cant call him
names wotta letdown

  but to ye editorial never fear    my ideas of
eds and their offices were nothing like that or
not much at any rate i had thought more on
these lines all editorial offices have a hard severe
oak desk trimmed with brightlv colored rejection
slips there are two piles on top of the desk one
is iabehd rejecied and has two subdivisions-
crud and new author the other is filled with
fan letters this pile is in a box labeled waste-
basket there is but one secretary and she would
never make marilyn monroe jump off her calendar

the name of the secretary is marilyn monroe

  the editor spends his day at important confer-
ences with  his wife  fans and  the old
emperor vat the ai and stories are not
bought fifteen minutes before the mag hits the
stands no fan would even think of such absurdity
why be so slow five minutes is better

  but why go on with this you have dispelled
my slightest doubts what with the prices and all
today you cant afford a lush palace or a gold
inlaid desk the only thing coming down these
days is rain and even that soaks you but as to
s-f editors being nine feet tall    why sam 
knew you were shy but then all us martians are

  may i ask baidowsky just what his letter was
all about here he goes off into great detail about
how wonderful sarge saturn was and after a long
loud lets-have-him-back he ups and says he dont
want him now to my alleged mind that meaneth
nothing or less

  now as to the battle or whatever it might be
called by the by-now-forgotten perpetrators on
great heroes who are invincible and have all the

luck etc etci dunno i doubt that its as

bad as all that s-f heroes are only the outstand-
ing type that come along every now and then
sure theyre out of the ordinary sure theyre
different than you or i why mister how much
would you enoy a story based on a hero who leads
the type of life you or i or the average joe
phann or john citizen leads not much pret-
ty dull id say who rares what time the average
guy eats breakfast nobody but when the hero
eats breakfast you know damn well that some-
things gonna happen why do you suppose that
the authors tell a story about this hero because
hes done something radically different hes a
different type of guy and does different kinds of
things i know id soon put down a story written
about the average guy but the s-f heroes arent
avcaee they do things thats why theyre
written about - the heroes had never done any-
thing important why thered be no story savvy

  as to gals scantily dad and shhhhhh muffle
sex why it does exist you know sure you
know then what in the name of the great green
ghu is all this blather about there let that end
it so be it amen

  i see you finally got dccamp in there some-
how that guy always gives me a bang and this
one was not at all different where has he been
recently and of late i havent seen him-that 
remember-since further back in ss andor
tws than i care to mention

  and the letter column was the best since i dunno
when too longer than last ish and long letter
columns always satisfy you have a new format
tl dont have to iio nt that ou too hard and
only one thing remains you guessed it trim
those edges change nothing hut trim em then
well all be happy and uh sam    theres a fan
outside to see you- kensington rd baltimore
 md

  so the baidowskys are beginning to get you
too eh and the seibels confusing what
as to trimmed edges i dunno but keep an eye
on the february issue

new trend

by tim haggard

  dear mr mines having come all the way
with my favorite type of escape reading i feel the
need of a letter to the editor for the first time
in my thirty years of reading

   started way back with gernsback the first
issues of amazing stories when buck rogers
first name was anthony moved along the space-
opera trail with argosy and mtmsey staggered
thru the thirties with professor jamison and his
endless adventures came along thru the glorious
nova days when sociology and intelligence crept
into stf and still read most of the magazines

  now  think i detect another trend-with your
group of magazines pushing it love and sure
enough a group of fans are yelling

  i cant remember any magazine that seemed to
allow sex or love to creep into anything but the
ending paragraphs with the exception of some-
thing named spicy science stories which was
published for a little while by a house which called
itself culture publishing company

  at any rate i will keep watching to sec how
this new trend of yours turns out our fans seem
to forget that a lot of writing lias gone into what
is now the biggest development in publishing since
the end of the war

  remember we have lots of new fans and no
one can tell exactly what some of them want fans
who screamed loudly at the picture the thing
never seemed to realize that it was the first stf
movie most movie-fans had seen the slick corn
-excellent plotting dialog and action probably
made more readers than anything in the past five
years same applies to the day the earth stood
still

   but my hats off to you mr mines glad to see
you trying something new-even if it turns out
badly who knows ten years from now you may
be praised at the conventions as the founder of a
new style

  ill be watching to see how you make out no
more letters tho circulation figures will speak-
better than i can good luck-hotel stanford 
west ml st new york  x v

   ps i forgot to say  like your magazines

  of course theres nothing new about sex-
thats the amazing part of the whole business
that it is always greeted with a new furore but
dont be misled we have no intention of pub-
lishing sexy startling stories as we seem to
be explaining endlessly we are interested in
hctter-ie more realistic-stories if that occa-
sionally involves sex well this is human nature
and more realistic but no author gets orders
to put sex into a story and sex is not what we
are selling thanx for good wishes

breakdown

by carol mckinney

   dear sm  i just finished reading a great novel
not one that barely carries you along with the plot
often losing you before your interest is really

captured but one that sends you eagerly ahead
wondering what the magic of words in the next
line paragraph or chapter may hold for the en-
tranced imagination i consider it one of the
truly great novels in science fiction today and
wonder if perhaps there will not be others who
feel the same way 

  of coursc im referring to -big planet by
jack vance in the september issue of ss your
short introduction did not begin to do it justice
it is indeed gorgeous adventure with fascinating
incidents and people

  the other three stories were also very good
with obligation by roger dee leading them
all things considered  will say that ive enjoyed
this issue of ss more than any other if these
incredibly good stories and novels continue i know
someone who will break down and buy a subscrip-
tion 

  the cover was mediocre however and not worth
any rave notices youve done much better in the
past

  if there are any fen in the provo area will
they please contact me in case theyre interested
in trading sf mags that is also if anyone else
wants to trade by mail please write no matter
how old this issue may be when it gets to you
attention foreign fen- north th east

  have been watching the mails breathlessly
ever since wheres that three bucks for the

kick in the teeth

by ancel c taflinger

  my dear samuel no this is not my first
letter to a science-fiction please note caps
magazine but it is the first in which i have been
inspired by actual nausea to take an editor to task
in the exercise of his official duties

   am at a loss to account for the bad taste which
led you to print major venture and the missmg
satellite in the august issue of startling  read
this monstrous parody because i read every sci-
ence- ficton magazine from kiver to kiver be-
ing one of those freaks who reads some twelve to
fifteen hundred words per minute thus if  skip
a story i fail to get my full half-hour of enjoy-
ment from the magazine and even in these days
two-bits is two-bits nonetheless i found it not
only a poor job of writing but failed to detect any
suggestion of humor whatever in plain language
-it stinks

  i hold no brief for captain future and charles
e fritch may be e hamilton in disgui- e attempt-
ing to get futures fans off his neck by making
the superman ridiculous for all i know still even
the c f stories written by your house name-
were well-done well-characterized well-motivated
and in general extremely interesting any and
all types of science-fiction have been grist for my
mill since my first experience of it-a single in-
stallment of after a million years found in a
dog-eared copy of argosy-allstory in  by
the way ive wondered tor  years how that
story came out i like spacc-opera but it must
be earnest sincere and well-written this major
	startling stories

venture tripe has none of these qualities

   granted that venture is attempted humor it is
still an insulting kick -in the teeth to those of us
who looked upon future as an impossible super-
man but an idealistic superman who used his
powers for the benefit of good against the forces
of evil not that i am an idealist i am currently
working toward a phd in business where there
is little room for idealism still there are such
things as ethics-

   and while in the vein and the mood i must take
 violent exception to the lead novel the lovers
 and your editorial in support of it the exception is
 not taken to the concept which is as old as the
 warnings of the prophets nor to the language
 which to my mind is an effort at pure sensational-
 ism having no place in either science-fiction or
 fantasy-which this story is i take my excep-
 tion to the poor writing which might well grace
 the pages of amazing or fantastic but not those
 with the usual high standards of startling and
 tws

   as a long-time writer i well know the difficul-
 ties of good characterization perhaps farmer is
 a new author whom you are nursing along i f so
 well and good but why tout him so highly on this
 story as noted before i read it but without in-
 terest the characters were wooden and in large
 measure stereotyped the action is obscured by stiff
 writing and for me at least the authors purpose
 never became clear the purpose of narrative
 fiction is to create emotion in the reader see any
 textbook on writing this one failed completely
 warm emotional story-maybe to you as edi-
 tor but not here

   for heavens sake mines dont repeat palmers
mistake and go overboard for something just
because most of your readers are avid for science-
fiction is no reason to ram a type or style down
our throats merwin never printed a single let-
ter which approved st clair yet because he
liked her stories we got them yours is the respon-
sibility as editor to select stories but thou dost
protest too much when you defend your choiccs edi-
torially in advance palmer soured me and ive
never gone back to his former or present maga-
zines bixby was wise in getting away from plan-
et before paul andersons mimeographed lead
stories ruin it completely  dont want t abandon
the thrilling group because of editorial insistence

   all im asking samuel is that you continue to
keep up the usual thrilling standards with no
more lapses than can be prevented just dont try
to force any stories down our throats with edi-
torial comment

   i know this letter is far too long but i couldnt
   it all said in fewer words- si east th st
   icago  

   we had just hauled off to let you have it
when we remembered that long before you see
this the november ish will have burst upon the
stands in all its glory and with it the crop of
letters only a small part of which we could
print raving madly about the lovers we
will leave it to these embattled fen to take care
of you except for a short word to the rest of
vou we recently attended a publishers lunch-

eon wherein were two guest speakers alfred
bestor and ted sturgeon bestors talk covered
the rise and change of science fiction from the
early cjemsback days-material which was more
or less new to the book publishers but would
be entirely familiar to you fans then ted
sturgeon got up to talk what he had pre-
pared or intended to say well never know
but he spotted us sitting there and he spent
twenty minutes raving about the lovers
we hadnt even sent him a free copy of the mag
either from the theme to the writing stur-
geon one of the finest writers in the stf field
had nothing but respect for farmers skill
warmth and bigness in handling so difficult a
theine when you stop to think about it do you
realize how badly that delicate theme could have
been botched  the defense rests 

mathematics yet

by ray capella

 dear sam hoo boy popp pops up with a
triangle cover for ss things must really be
jumping in the ol editorial-like territory you
daring boy you first the change in cover format
now a popp triangle

  this may come as a shock old boy-but i isnt
kicking about it because-here now mines come
on wake up wake for the sun that scattered
into flight the stars afore him from the field of
night    ah thats better

  siriusly no matter what the little pcepul may
say about this triangle cover it is very well
done matter of fact im no longer even kicking
about the cover-format change-not since the mar-
gin strips are being cobred with more taste will
appreciate even more when the right hand strip
matches in color with the title-color as in the au-
gust  ish

  as for this sex-in-stf er-discussion were hav-
ing come now fellow bems and assorted little
monsters arent we being slightly silly leave us
just take the editorial viewpoint sex in stf when
it is only an essential or entirely part of the story
otherwise phoo on those who put sex in it for
sexs sake i can take an stf yarn with sex in it-
have done so-and enjoy it so long as it follows
the above prescription you said it sam

 but-sam why not apply the same to covers
and if you dont please alternate between girlie
covers n stf covers by schomburg or emsh huh
i say this cause you dropped hints in the latest
tws about coming triangle covers looking
back on stf i see triangles all over the field-
more than i can bear  of em are like that
so   lets keep those stf covers that have been
coming to us through ss personally i think
theyve reached the standard set by bonestell

  and dont tell me you dont have any word on
whats done to ss on the art staff thats a lotta
jetwash bixby said that to me at the nycon
i remember he looked rather disgruntled-probably
cause there was no bar to go with the con a
reason that left yours truly feeling bad too you
can have a word in the staff-youve been making

by norman clarke

  dear sammy bring back captain fu-
ture anthologize him reprint him give us
original cf stories but bring him back
the sooner the better charles e fritchs ma-
jor venture and the missing sat-
ellite made me yearn for my old hero all the
more by the way that little gem was the funniest
stf story  ever read

   your august editorial regarding the lead novel
the lovers was the best youve ever written
since you took over the reins of twsss and
since your inaguration as king youve never print-
ed a better novel than the lovers terrific
story that hard-cover material turns up quite
frequently in both your mags

  the novelets and shorts made the august issue

ghastlier machines to grace tvvssss

way and got no bones im glad one cap future

organization

by robert a flating

  dear sir trigger thoughts by curt

storm rang a bell and i dug out durants story
of philosophy in the preface to the second
edition durant says

  human knowledge had become unmanageably
vast every science had begotten a dozen more
each subtler than the rest

  he goes on to mention the tremendous advances
made by astronomy geology physics physiology
anthropolgy archeology history theology political
theory inventions economic greeds and philosophy
he then said human knowledge had become too
great for the human mind all that remained was
the scientific  iccialist who knew more and more
about less and less and the philosophical speculator
who knew less and less about more and more the
specialist put on blinders in order to shut out from
his vision all the world but one little spot to which
he glued his nose perspective was lost facts
replaced understanding  and knowledge split into
a thousand isolated fragments no longer generated
wisdom

   in this situation the function of the profession-
al teacher was clear it should have been to medi-
ate between the specialist and the nation-

  didnt someone say that it would have taken sci-
entists working separately  or  years to devel-
op the atom bomb the manhattan project was a
good example of coordination and cooperation un-
der the worst of circumstances due to the need for
extreme secrecy

  if this type of organizing and thinking were
applied to research in cancer tuberculosis etc
they would be just as successful

  true there is more and more exchange of ideas
among and within the sciences but as curt storm
infers the scientists would be indignant at any
attempt at control and interference by an out-
sider

  i sympathize with them but believe it will even-
tually come about- f  cleveland  ohio

  happy we are that somebody brought this up
-though we havent read durant for years we
think he rates as a crystallizer of thought a
weeder out of underbrush a man with the price-
less gift of making the obtuse seem simple well
do we remember his matchless paraphrasing of
spinoza and then our own catastrophic attempts
to read spinoza in the original

a pat on the head

by rory m faulkner

  dear mr mines well youve done it again
put out a top-notch issue of startling in this sep-
tember number the novel by jack vance is the
most fascinating thing ive seen in a long time i
have always been utterly bewitched by stories of
wanderings-the odyssey used to be my favorite
when a child-and this one certainly took its hero
over plenty of territory the atmosphere and de-
scriptions of the big planet intrigued me as much
as the story vance achieved an effect of sheer
beauty seldom found in a s-f yarn and those beau-
tiful beautiful names-myrtlesee jubilith tsalom-
bar beaujolais-they are sheer music to pronounce
the whole place seems so real one can almost draw
	startling stories

a map of it please put me down for that reserva-
tion on the first ship to big planet

  of the other three stories i think the little short
one night talk appeals to me most then comes
the obligation-this one is really outstanding
the perfect gentleman is cute but not very
thought provoking

  as for tlie cover i like all the blood tire and
gore but i am not so sold  the pop-eyed gal
with ex-opthalmic goitre give me the new
rergej-anytime good-heavens-whod ever
think id be calling for that guy

  if this goes on-ss will outshine all the others
in the field one thing-please dont publish
any of those tough detective kales a la mickey
spillane only thinly veneered as s-f if i want de-
tective stories i can read detective magazines

  farewell with another pat on the head from
the great-gramma- oenetti placc covina
calif

  ps unlike marian bradley i still have an
aching yen to see over the top of the next hill
myself

 the perfect gentleman not very
thought provoking depends upon what you
think about nicht wahr should we have our
minds sent out to be dry-cleaned

the women

by marian cox

  dear sam being a woman oi considerable de-
termination im still actively crusading for more
men on magazine covers james oggerino appar-
ently likes women  the covers thats his priv-
ilege however may i point out to him that in
his little survey of those who dislike scantily clad
girls he has neglected to mention one rather large
group women we have no over-powering de-
sire to see beautiful babes  the covers a lus-
cious lassie leering at s from airless space doesnt
strike us as being particularly impressive if any-
thing she impresses us as being utterly ridiculous
no girl in her right mind would brave the discom-
forts of a vacuum clad in nothing but a little bit
of metal upholstery and speaking of discomfort
if youd like an idea of how uncomfortable those
things would be just try wearing a strapless boned
bra for an hour or two go on sam-i dare you

  we poor gals demand the right to be clad sen-
sibly when we appear on covers not that we ex-
pect you to deprive the poor men of their clothes-
just distribute things a little more evenly after
all why should we freeze stop breathing etc
just so the male sex can be comfortable let the
old softies try flitting through space in their under-
wear let tlirw give up the foolish practice of
breathing

  and while im on this subject of equal rights for
women id like to put in a plug for a newly-
formed fan club designed to give woman a tew
equal rights in fandom its the fanettes
and as the name imnlies all members are females
we have a zine the femzine put out entire-
ly by fem fans the first issue will have been
mailed by the time this letter sees print the gals
who are members have really entered into the
spirit of the thing and expect to have a lot of fun
in the club dues are f a year and any further
information will be sent on request come on gals

heres your chance to prove that youre just as
good a fan as most of these men who protest so
loudly against gals who are fans and youll have
a wonderful time as well

  the september ss was very good  enjoyed
everything but one sentence in the guest editorial
amused me no end says mr leinster nobody
needs any longer to be on the defensive for his
flair for science fiction ha he should meet
my family that sentence would be retracted so
fast your head would swim

  sam please give us back the old cover arrange-
ment and the old type contents page please
and what happened to the little line at the bottom
of the contents page that kept us poor readers
from hounding the magazine dealer to death about
the new startling lets have it back
pleae

  loved that finlay illo why not have more of
his stuff-th ab sq sioux city hwa

  one reason you cant have more finlay is
that he is the most mcticulous worker there ever
was he slaves over each drawing frequently
staying up all night over one consequently his
output is limited by the rigorous hands of the
clock theres only so much a man can do in
his waking hours buh-lieve me we get all the
finlays we can

  we have given a lot of thought three min-
utes to your invitation to try wearing a strap-
less boned bra for an hour or two and enthus-
iastically decline even without the natural at-
tributes which would make it necessary and fit-
ting we still somehow have the idea it would
be thoroughly uncomfortable the metal uphol-
stery of course is on the way out anyway ex-
cept for them ferns as absolutely require it and
judging by trends in the trade it looks as if it
wont be long before ferns will appear on covers
and on beaches without the hitherto indispen-
sable aid of these appliances and with that
will go the glamor i bet

farmer fan

by james r harris

  dear sam a new era has been opened in sci-
ence fiction and take a bow sam startling
has opened it with a bang with the lovers

  i have been reading stf for about  years now
and without a doubt the lovers ranks as the
no  story of them all sure i like bradbury
phillips etc but you can safely put philip jose
farmer at the head of my list oi favorite writers

  take heed sam this lovers will draw some
unfavorable comment but ill bet the favorable
letters are far more numerous it is the best
science fiction story i have ever read lets have
more

  by the way your cover for august was the
best vou have had iji years a perfect combination
with the lovers

  on the side-collectors tike note-i have sev-
eral english stf pocket books and also a few brit-
ish editions of american stf mags which i offer
the ether vibrates	

or sale or trade to anyone any fans interested

story at the earliest possible date- hamp-
ton st ashland ky

  is that service  a farniy story in this very
issue and keep an eye on tws for mother
a new novelet by your favorite boy

moldily philosophical

by dave hammond

  dear sam mines i just finished big planet
by jack vance it was as good as i had hoped
and maybe a little better it was richly colorful
magnificently tipped-ill and really gorgeous now
witli a few more stories like that under his belt
im looking for vance to surpass some of edgar
rice burroughs work

  now dont wrinkle your royal brow sir i
know that edgar rice burroughs had a trite
lot i know his heroes are dull six feet tall and
grey-eyed without exception and  know his sci-
ence is ridiculous his english poor and all that
but when it came to telling a story a moving
dramatic action-filled extravaganza erb had no
peers

  vance can tell a story and his characters are
very real just a touch more to settings and im-
pressions and big planet would have just had
the emotional haze around it that make chess-
men of mars land that time for-
got and at the earths core good

stories

  so vvliat did i say

  i liked the letter column as usual no letters
there by me but marian bradlev mentioned my
name even if urflattcringly and joe gibson men-
tioned the philadelphia science fiction society
and bix in his personals section was probably
meaning me when he mentioned the initials dh

  id like to get moldily philosophical right now
or start crusading for some personal thing or
just shoot off my big mouth but ive gotta stencil
the next issue of the psfs news mv public
awaits-box  runnemcde new jersey

  marian bradley will have your scalp if you
spell her name with an o instead of an a
so i fixed it for you just between us nothing
public about these discussions thanks for ego-
boo on big planet every once in a while
we like to run a story which doesnt baffle any-
one but is just fun to read

garrulous

by joe gibson

  dear sam now this sept startling i like
- kensington hr jersey city  nj

  now theres a boy who listens we said make
em short and be sure did in case your public
is wondering whether or not you sprained your
typewriter finger well tell tbem joe we asked
for them short

note to moskowitz

 by bobby gene warner

   dear editor after reading the lead novel in
 the august issue of startling i have but one
 thing to say and that is-well with this lump
 in my throat what can i say jt was good it
 zvas science fiction true science fiction the best
 of science-and that means above the level of as-
 tounding-or what have you and i defy anyone to
 say that it was not it is the type of story i would
 like to read each and every time i pick up an issue
 of a science fiction magazine i can see no reason
 why it should not see hard-cover printing in the
 near future the lon ers was the sort of
 story which makes startling startling i am
 sure that i speak for all fandom when i say
 more pleas el

   and that cover-can it be earle k bergey the
 old splotch and blotch bergey of days gone by
 it it is-then  gladly take back each and every
 nasty thought ive ever harbored about him for
 lo these many years about six i think that
 cover was great oh for the original well
 i can want can i not you can not-ed

   wal it sure seems that  is going to be sss
 big year if more stories like the lovers pass-
 port lo pax etc continue to appear between your
 hallowed pages  will be your best year of
 course  will he better then  even better
 and so on into infinity

   oh chuckle chuckle do we get a sequel to
 major venture and the missing
 satellite but i suppose thats up to charles
 e fritch huh

   the best letter in tev was written by d y
 cummins i supixise she was referring to psycho-
 analysis or maybe autosuggestion when she
 said   and by inward probing discover and
 remove the cause of which jitters are the result
 thank you mr cummins for a very intelligent
 letter

  oh henry m cap fut is done and dead of a
 too-deep inhalation of stardust so let him be
 will you and grags rusty the androids long
 since decomposed simon wright is making elec-
 tric brains for john w campbell jr and joan
 c is married to a martian murp and now has
 five pseudo-kids so she cant do much in the way
 of galactic gallivantin these days in short-the
 old caps gone sob so let sam alone huh
 there now sam if he hounds you again i shall
 personally thingamabob him-right across his
  posterior

   in case this sees print-hey fen  need certain
 issues of startling and thrilling won-
 der from  to present they must be
 mint ill pay e each for the ones i need
 vlaybe more if theyre minty mint send me lists
 of what you have

   now sam after all the nice things i said
 ancha gonna print my plug huh pulecze-
 po box  besstnay texas

   with all the plugs weve printed we should
 be able to retire to a stud farm in kentucky
 and none of your double meanings either as
 to cap future moskowitz is in there slugging
 yet
	startling stories

from japan

by tetsu yano

  dear sir i beg your pardon that my english
is not so correct and you will very much annoyed
to read my letter why i write you is as to the
science fiction

  i am  years old and have a wife and one baby
and my profession is photographer and have a little
photo-finishing shop i learned english  years
when  were student at high school and university-
i studied law  could not graduate university be-
cause i entered in army last war but my english
is very poor

  i have one clever brother-in-law he is a pro-
fessor of architecture many nights we used to
have pleasant talk which concerned universe other
planet and so on you can imagine in several
field in fiction i have much interest in scientific
story especially concerned with other planet rock-
et etc

  in japan there arc many magazine that contain
something like literature hut we have not sci-
entific-fiction magazine as to mystery there is
one named hoseki jewel-then i have to read
american magazine after i had read through
several numbers i thought in my mind that some-
thing unknown interesting field or career shall be
opened i cannot remember which is better to use
-shall or will-with this fact that i am reading
science fiction

  of course i like camera but  like printed page
better i mean i like book i dont know my
future figure but if possible i want to work in
the field which have some concerning with science
ficiion

  then  made up my mind that after now  will
read s-f seriously and systematically why i
used the word systematically fven when i read
planet mender or something like such fic-
tion if i did not know the solar system i cant un-
derstand the story precisely but why watson can
fly so fast to mercury from mars by what space
ship i cant imagine

  my scientific knowledge is so poor and i want
to get teacher or kindness guide who teach me
that which book first and second-systematic read-
ing for me

  if you may mention me the necessary book and
publisher i am very much pleased many times
i hesitated that to whom can i write and ask for
help to mr blish no supposing he is very
busy to mr editor of science magazine he is
some busy too but i dare write you by my poor
english mr mines

  please show me my way to read and to under-
stand science fiction please if i could get your
reply i am very much appreciated

  good luck to you and your magazine-  iv
knya iosakiclto higaskinadaku kobe japan

  fen who have been lusting for japanese post-
marks on their mail have a chance to meet a
charming personality with an alert intelligence
and do a good turn too by answering some of
mr yanos burning questions im sure hed be
delighted to correspond with american fen poor
fellow we have recommended a few books to
him also dropped the thought that if he just

keeps reading stf long enough hell catch on
but in the meantime why not write hint your-

the best things in life are free

by patrick m f kelly

  sam shame on you for the take-off of capt
future in the current issue of ss i hope every
cf fan will take you to task as for your com-
ment on my letter in tws-there is no contradic-
tion free thinking  is as much a bias as those
of ii duce hitler and stalin- s figuerosa

  hows that again

all burned up

by eunice e shaver

  dear mr mines  am sick and tired of you
calling that column of personal correspondence be-
tween you and a few picked friends a fan column
i have written you six or seven letters which per-
haps were not so witty or interesting to you as
your friends drivel but which may have been of
interest to some other reader of your magazine

  although i am sorry to say it startling
stories remains my favorite science fiction
magazine

  i dont care if you read this letter or not but
i assure you i feel much better for having written

it- hamilton st houston  texas

  were spoiling you eunice this is the secohd
letter of yours weve used friends did you
say  friends ha

back talk

by l sprague decamp

  dear sam herewith some comments on the
recent letters by messrs browne gross and mil-
ler on exotic words in stories and your replies

  first a correction van vogt once told me that
he rhymed with joked

  second an answer about odd astronomical
names  tfie babylonians began the custom of
naming planets after their gods nabu ishtar
nerigal etc because they thought they were their
gods which is how the pseudo-science of astrology
started iater the greeks took over the custom
naming the visible planets after the corresponding
gods in their own pantheon hermes aphrodite
aries etc and finally the romans did likewise
whence mercurius venus mars etc

  then the arabs named many stars but being
muslims and lacking a multiplicity of gods they
named them alter ordinary things eg deneb
tail and in still later times after the invention
of the telescope astronomers named other celes-
tial objects after other graeco-roman mythological
figures other astronomers and so on

  third a question can anybody solve a prob-
lem that has long bothered writer of stories laid
in an exotic setting the remote past the remote
future or another world nomcly what to name
the ether vibrates	

people and places

  obviously jones and smith chicago and ber-
lin wont do one can make up nonsense-syhables
like bu and ga but these are unconvincing be-
cause real languages arent like that there
wouldnt be enough such syllables to go round
chinese though nominally monosyllabic uses
many compounds of two or three syllables to avoid
ambiguity

  or one can adopt names from terran history
and mythology but it knocks a hole in my sus-
pension-of-disbelief when i came across denictrio
in the chronicles of conan for i know that this
is modern italian ior the classical greek demet-
rios and shouldnt turn up in howards imaginary
prehistoric world it also gives me pause when
as has twice happened in recent years  come
across rhiannon as an extra-terrestrial name
knowing that rhiannon was an ancient welsh god-
dess

   or one can do as i sometimes do invent an ex-
 otic language of logical grammar and phonology
 modelled after some terran tongue as gozashtan-
 dou is suggested by persian but then some read-
 ers balk at the resulting words even when they
 are quite pronounceable if you look at them

  the trouble seems to be the modern system of
teaching children to read this sight-reading
treats words as units to he recognized by shape
as if they were chinese ideograms without bother-
ing with the sound-significance of individual let-
ters the children learn to read faster earlier than
they otherwise would but never fully master the
fantastic vagaries of english spelling and when
they meet a word of unfamiliar shape it throws
them completely never having learned to look
at a word phonetically they find it as one of
my critics once putit a pain in the neck to do
so

  of course in the glory that was i had no
choice i had to call perikles xanthippou peri-
kles xanthippou because that was the historical
characters real name most of these greek names
have quite simple translations but if i had referred
to perikles as surrounder the son of yellow
horse which is what perikles xanthippou means

i fear i should have confused more readers than
the other way

  well whats the answer if the readers cant
propound a final one perhaps they can have some
fun kicking the subject around one could confine
ones stories to homey tales of soda-jcrkers named
henry jones who accidentally mix up an elixir of
life when filling an order for a banana split such
stories are all right too but if science-fiction ever
comes to consist exclusively of them i fear i shall
find it just too dull and have to go back to working
for a living-wallingford pa

  gad not real work- anything but that
though offhand we lean toward the theory that
some of spragues stories represent some work
or a reasonable facsimile thereof

  two letters from craig sutton-a tearful plea
for trimmed edges a rave for big planet
a nod for guest editorials a gripe about the
short stories a sneer at bradley and r k free-
man and this

-  and being the stupidest fan today i

still cant see so much as a remote connection
between fruit bugs and me ill be twice damned
if i look like a fruit bug    given im ugly
but i am not a fruit bug somebody else rec-
ommended that the good doctor put the humans
into bottles and study them that i agree to
maybe then we could get a good analogy

  as to whether you are a fruit bug or not-on
that we cautiously reserve decision pending the
arrival of a photograph for study purposes and
putting you into a bottle is a fascinating idea-
dont tempt me but s i have explained until
my arm is weary you dont have to be a fruit
bug the life force works tor all living crea-
tures doncha remember the egyptians baby-
lonians persians-all the races which built up
mighty empires and then got tired

  dear mr mines today i had the great pleasure
of meeting one of your newer writers a guy
named roger dee he is a very nice friendly sort
of fellow about  really intelligent and a bit
modest he has a pontiac a couple of dogs and
one charming and beautiful wife who is equally
friendly and easy to know we w ere really pleased
with them and refcret they couldnt stay longer
roger is now working on a second novel and sev-
eral shorter items he has stories scheduled for
several magazines other than yours as well as a
couple of anthologies i dont think it will be
long before hes one of the big name writers it
couldnt happen to a nicer guy he takes writing
seriously it isnt just something that he does for
money he likes it and wants to do the best pos-
sible job

   new ss is pretty good the novel is interesting
 and the other items were pretty good cover was
 excellent- l-th st columbus go

on belief and such

 by rev c m moorhead

   sir at the risk of jtarting another religious
 war i would like to say a few things in answer
 to some remarks made by mrs mary corby in
 the september  issue of startling stor-
 ies

   she said the two great enemies of birth-control
 are ignorance and religion why is it that many
 people use religion as the scape-goat for all the
 worlds ills and woes this is a great age for
 passing the buck and i find that the out-worn
 word religion comes in for more than its share

   i confess that i grow weary from the way the
word is overworked religion is a broad subjcct
id like for the lady to be more specific to
what religion is she alluding there are  extant
religions today and each has its following does
the word as she used it refer to christianity if
so to which branch does she refer christianity is
divided into  main branches roman catholic
greek orthodoxy and protestantism which of
these three is opposed to birth-control which
of these three discharged the doctors from the hos-
pital for giving birth-control advice to their pa-
tients

   again she said in the better fedtfountries  
 knowledge of birth-control has been disseminated
 in spite of the opposition of the church another
 hroai general term what is meant by the term
 church

   a person cannot judge all christianity by out
 segment of it  wonder if people realize that many
 many churches of liberal protestantism not only
 teach but urge birth-control and this not because
 it was forced upon them but because it seemed the
 humanitarian thing to do as a minister i myself
 have given such advice to many young couples who
 have come to me for pre-marital counselling

   finally while he does not state it in so many
 words yet the implication is there that religion
 is to blame for the abortions racket i think that
 is carrying the thing a little too far mv observa-
 tions have been and i do not claim infallibility
 that many of the women caught in the abortions
 racket are either too lasv to use contraceptives or
 are caught in the family-way out of wedlock
 the chief reason why so mnnv girls are caught in
 the family way out of wedlock is because their
 parents are too damned cowardly to tell them
 the facts of life sufficiently early to avoid that pit-
 fall so dont blame the church for that

   i get sick and tired of the attitude that chris-
 tianity is the basis for all the worlds ills there
 are altogeher too many people who parrot-like
 quote what someone else said without taking the
 trouble to see if the person quoted is correct

   some wit once said we believe only what we
want to believe and after reading the fan letters
in ss and tws i am convinced that he hit
the nail squarely on the head

   and now i will crawl back into my web behind
the organ-community church kelleys island
ohio

  we have a small suspicion that rev moor-
head may have put his finger squarely on it
when he says we believe only what we want to
believe may turn out yet that belief is a mat-
ter of the ductless glands

classics and ulcers

by jan gardner

   dear sam just finished reading the oct isli of
startling stories cover was excellent
kind of made me shiver even in all this summer
heat at first glance it would appear the new format
for your front covers cause the illustration to shrink
up too much but the compensation of no lettering
will probably justify this format in the eyes of those
readers who delight in tacking up exceptional covers
on club house walls this way all they gotta do is
snip off the edges containing the mag title and story
titles and zippo an unmarred reproduction of space
or bems or whatever presents itself maybe you
should print the mag with two identical front
covers on the front that way the more intense
strata of fandom can whip out their three-dimen-
sional-illusion photo viewers pop in miniature re-
productions of the cover and egads man its
come alive etc etc might even make money out
of it phew   how corny can i get anything
for a sob in this day and age

   now for the meat of your mag the ether vi-
brates  whoops should have said the stories
oh well might as well be hanged for something
good i was seriously considering becoming a stf
editor as being the quickest and easiest way to get
my own stories published until i read your heroic
saga of editordom now ive changed my mind
ill keep on grinding out my brilliant classics and let
the editor develop ulcers reading em as an author
i stand a chance to survive as an editor the lon-
gevity graph seem dangerously low besides what
are you guys gonna do for a living when we finally
do land tin mars at least the authors can become
roving reporters yuk yuk

   after reading your fascinating readers column
and noting the excellent plotting characterization
and how and smash endings but theyre all so
much alike a street number and a state lets have
more originality in each letter i was prepared to
cast my eagle optics on the first page of the first
story namely asylum earth now here i
seys is a story its even got sex in it held me
spellbound to the last page need more be said by
the way    hint hint   in case elliott writes a
sequel to this masterpiece i gotta idea for a smash
beginning brings the same characters right into
the story with vim and vigor all loose ends imme-
diately tied up gee i didnt know you were so
brilliant oh but im not im just modest about it

eventful historic making conversations between the

   the guided man was a welcome diversion
 in stf humor this type of stuff i can stand lots
 more of reams and reams of it as long as its as
 well written as decamps delightful opus real hu-
 mor is sorrowfully lacking jn stf and me being a
 serious kind of a guy i need stuff like that to cheer 
 me up thanxs much

   throwback was okay in a fair sort of way
 that scoundrel jon irked me considerably with his
 frigid attitude all that fun he could of had   
 oh well just a story what am i saying maybe it
 was better than fair after all to get me that inter-
 ested 

   notice of intent was an excellent short
 story i enjoyed this one very much interesting
 worthwhile motivation the author writes from
 the heart it seems as well as from the brain and the
 linger tips

   gravesong was tops in my opinion this
 sort of story has a marvelous blend of realism and
 atmosphere in it something that seems to come as
 a result of a good handling as well as a well bal-
 anced plot id like to see a full length novel by
 miller with a similar style how about it

   disposal could have been disposed of by the
 same rings that made the story passable-fair it
 missed being sparkling humor by a sizable hair-
 breadth

    having taken the stories apart thereby satisfy-
 ing my rejection-slip-ego lets start on the illos
 here let it be known to all and sundry that the
 following gilt edged comments are only one ar-
 tists opinion yup im an artist too i say this
 in full realization that my genius is unfortunately
 not appreciated by this war-weary world but some
 day  ah yes some day  my portraits will
 hang in the rogues gallery    oops i mean in the
 art galleries ps to ed you may delete these
 asinine parathentical ramblings if you wish i think
 they stink too but its a sure-fire way of seeing a
 letter in print oh no no anything but
 that not the waste basket

   finlay as always is super-superb any story
 endorsed by his drawings is qualification enough
 for me to plunge into it with avid interest how
 about several illustrations through the pages of the
 lead novel it has always seemed to me that this

who want to write

but cant get started

 do you have that constant urge to write
 but fear that a beginner hasnt a chance
 then listen to what the former editor of

 there is more room for newcomers in the writing field
 today than ever before some ol the greatest of writing
 men and women hare passed from the scene in recent
 years who will take their places who will be the new

 the danger is heal

ivil defense officials every-
where face a real handicap
in our american talent for put-
ting things off we read that
there is danger of war-but
not before  or  or
 we sigh and relax we
know in our hearts that the
danger is real but we are con-
tent to wait until -it is at our
very doors before taking the first steps to protect
ourselves

   lets face it so long as we need armed forces in
a state of readiness main street must be ready too
we must get ready and stay ready for as long as
the threat of aggression exists-five years ten years
fifty years if need be

  the kremlin never stops plotting to get what it

  comedy in which the hero suffers and suffers
  the slings and arrows of outrageous fate but as
  i have somewhere explained before i cut my
  baby teeth on p g wodehouse and havent
  ever outgrown it lets face it-it is my un-
  shakable if wobbly belief that real humor is
  one of the highest intellectual exercises why
  for because in order to be a humorist a man
  has to have an exceptionally well balanced mind
  so that he can see the ludicrous and the ridicu-
  lous in any situation

      if you dont think that is a highly intellectual
  exercise try it so why is milton bcrle funny

joe semenovich

  we have a vision of the editorial falling-out that
must have occurred an unkind word perhaps or
a mild disagreement over the merits of an item
submitted for publication then suddenly harsh
words uttered in loud sharp tunes tbe clenched
fist the drawn blade the stormy exit of m frei-
berg  the cry of stop the presses and the rumble
of an a b dick slowing to a halt the glaring
eyes and hoarse sounds of breathing as the stencil
bearing mr freibergs editorial was ripped bodily
from the cylinder and torn to shreds and the afore-
quoted magnificent declaration substituted

one of the best fan-artists around if he is proceed-

as to be beneath certain pro-artists we could name

sept  p m

  just got this thing back from the press and
there are three wide-eyed little inches to fill
we could simply reach for a fanzine and give it
the treatment but were not quite up to that
task having just returned to our desk after four
wonderful dazzling hectic days in    guess
where youre so right and we couldnt focus
to read a goodyear blimp much less a fanzine
just a few words on how we feel about the
convention then

  we had the time of our life we met the most
wonderful bunch of people weve ever come
across under one roof we attended one of the
most terrific shindigs we ever attended we
spent four days in a world apart  a vastly
stimulating little world and somehow as en-
couraging a one populated with exciting person-
alities the likes of which are scarce as hens
chompers in this wide outside world we have re-
turned to   

  it was a time we shall never forget were
looking forward to the next one and the next
and to seeing all you swell people again we
hope each and every one of you had a helluva
time too
