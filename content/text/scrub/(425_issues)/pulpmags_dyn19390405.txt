is the time f

business is searching

for you if  

right now in many lines there is a search
 for really good men-managers leaders-
men who can take charge of departments busi-
nesses branch offices and get tilings humming

  as always there are not enough ordinary
jobs to go round-but rarely before in the
history of american business has there been
so much room at the top and new jobs are
being created by the business pick-up in many
lines-jobs that pay splendidly and that open
the way to lifetime success

  ordinarily there would be plenty of men to
fill these jobs-men in junior positions who
had been studying in spare time but most men
have been letting their training slide during

these dark years of depressionwhats the

use-you have heard them say perhaps
there has been some excuse for sticking to any
old kind of a job one could get the past few
years-but the door is wide open for the man
with ambition and ability now

  and dont let anyone tell you that oppor-
tunity only knocks once-thats one of the
most untruthful sayings ever circulated op-

portunities flourish for every american every
day of his life

  far more to the point is to be ready-to be
brepared-to make yourself interesting to the
big-time employer-and lasalle offers you a
short-cut method of qualifying for opportunity
jobs in accounting law traffic executive man-
agement and kindred occupations

  lasalle extension is  years old-averages
over  enrollments a year- american
firms each employ  or more lasalle-trained
men-surveys show that many lasalle stu-
dents attain  salary increase after gradu-
ation- of all cpas in the usa are
lasalle-alumni

  why not find out what lasalle has done and
is doing for men in your position send and get
the facts see what lasalle can do for you
personally

  theres no question about it-business is
picking up-jobs are looking for men-the time
nas come for you to qualify for prosperity

erence is given to those which seem of
the most general interest tell us what
you think of our choice

frozen utopia

the cold truth

dear sir

  is it possible to produce a tempera-
ture of absolute zero-j g harris-
burg ia

  for all practical purposes scientists
have reached absolute zero - and
strange indeed are some of the experi-
mental results  below zero on our
familiar fahrenheit scale recorded in
the arctic by amundsen in  is be-
lieved to be the greatest natural cold
ever reported but this compared to
the laboratory efforts of cryogenic or
low-temperature experimenters was
but a warn summer day at the uni-
versity of california matter has been
chilled to  above zero on the kel-
vin absolute scale which is nearly 
below zero on the centigrade scale or-
button up your overcoat-minus 
fahrenheit

  at this temperature hydrogen lique-
fies-and helium defies gravity lique-
fying within two degrees of absolute
zero helium almost completely loses its
viscosity the property by virtue of
which fluids and gases resist change of
shape surface films will then spread
over any object brought into contact
with the helium and will even climb out
of the liquid and ascend to considerable
heights in defiance of gravity

  the world record for low tempera-
ture however belongs to holland
using the same method as the ameri-
cans but more powerful equipment
dutch scientists have plumbed to only
forty-four ten-tliouraidths of a degree
above absolute zero the ingenious

method is based on the principle that
magnetizing matter heats it while de-
magnetizing lowers its temperature
magnetic salts pre-cooled with liquid
helium are magnetized and the heat
thus generated is drawn off with he-
lium vapor then the salts are further
chilled by demagnetization and repeti-
tion of the cycle literally jams the sub-
stance down toward the objective of ab-
solute zero the temperature at which
matter is wholly deprived of heat

 though the goal may never be
reached even its vicinity is studied
with profit by chemists all chemical
reactions obey the laws of thermody-
namics governing the relations be-
tween heat and energy in the region
of absolute zero it is possible to foretell
whether certain chemical combinations
are thermodynamically possible if
not there is no use seeking a chemical
activator or catalyst for an impossible
combination but of much greater pos-
sible benefit to mankind than mere
tune-saving are cryogenic experiments
on living organisms

  certain cells-spores infusoria bac-
teria-all of them dry or nearly dry are
actually able to survive temperatures
close to absolute zero in that extreme
cold the organisms go into a state of
suspended animation-but resume nor-
mal living when thawed out cells of
higher water content however ordina-
rily die when subjected to this freezing
because their internal liquid crystalizes
and its molecular structure is altered
but now a way has been found to avoid
this damage-and possibilities appear
which stagger the imagination

  if organisms are frozen in a split sec-
ond with liquid hydrogen their mole-
cules are immobilized before they can
change pattern they become like
glass solid but with the molecular ar-
rangement of liquid in this way sus-
pended animation has been induced in
yeast cells which may be revived after
being preserved  years-without

          slaves attention carver yelled you are free arise and till your masters

will the dictators rule the world learn the


  prison of time

by eando binder

when barry carver was shot down in ihe sahara his urgent message undelivered the 
tator nations were about to crush the allies but that was before barry found
shorraine land of the mirage and the demon people of phoryx who schemed
to enslave all earthmen-and sha-tahn guiding power of all dictators

  carver raised his head and looked
through the heat haze that lay over the
mighty sahara the cloudless blue of
sky was clear they had left satisfied
that he could not have survived both
the business-like strafing of their ma-
chine-guns and the crash

  barry carver grinned they were
wrong by a miracle he had come
through unscathed not a bullet had
touched him he remembered nothing
of the crash obviously his body had
been thrown clear onto the cushioning
sand

barry c a r v e r groaned a
great light pressed against his
tortured eyelids he opened them
and winced a torrent of sunlight
stabbed into his eyes blindingly he
rolled himself over spitting sand from
his mouth he raised a hand to the ten-
der lump on his head how long had
he been out what had happened

  memory stabbed into his mind as
the sunlight had stabbed into his eyes
the attack by three enemy ships whose
wings bore the black swastika they
had brought his lone ship down-

answer in this timely book-length super-science novel


dynamic science stories

  he looked around

  there his small ship lay a twisted
shattered wreck that would never fly
again it had come down like a rock
the engine had buried itself out of sight
rows of bullet-holes neat and orderly
zigg-zagged across the crumpled wings
gasoline soaked sand rapidly evapo-
rated in the hot sun by that he knew
he had been unconscious only a few
minutes why the plane hadnt burst
into flame toasted him to a corpse was
another miracle well he must accept
the little finger of fate

  he came to his knees and suddenly
found himself dizzy almost nauseated
he fought off his weakness no time
now to be a weakling he must carry
on somehow reach an allied-held port
deliver his message it was vital more
vital perhaps than any other phase of
the great war that had turned the en-
tire world into an armed camp in 
scouting over western china far from
where the japanese-american front
lay he had spied a secret japanese
army marching southward if they
once smashed through to the coast
of india the dictator coalition would
have driven its first wedge through
the allies earth-girdling belt of con-
tinuity

  barry carver had decided this infor-
mation must go directly to ghq in
london radio was out of the ques-
tion because of the barrage of artificial
static made by both sides in the at-
tempt to hinder the other so he would
fly since he had a long-range scout ship
fueled for  miles he had had his
choice-north or south route north
lay the enemy in full force too risky
but south via arabia and the sahara
then north to london-that was the
safest route

  but of course as chance would have
it the few of the enemys devil-dogs pa-
trolling northern africa had seen him
given chase shot him down   

 ital information bravely he set

  	out on foot across the burning
sands equipped with one canteen of
water a pair of binoculars an auto-
matic and a compass young and
strong he refused to be pessimistic
about his chances he would soon find
an oasis or run into a caravan he
plodded away from his wrecked plane
out into the ocean of sand that heaped
endlessly to all horizons

  three days later barry carver was
not so sure of himself he sucked the
last drop of carefully rationed water
from his canteen and flung it away
wearily he raised the binoculars to his
blood-shot eyes nothing but sand sand
in all directions bitter curses rasped
from his parched throat vital infor-
mation was he to die with it searing
his brain

  that afternoon under the pitiless
sun his mind began to wander he
fought against it but hopelessly he
was going to die out in this sandy hell i
all else slipped from his mind even the
great war that was blasting humanity
he moaned like a wild animal his
blistered feet burning skin aching
throat were driving him mad mad

  then he saw it-the great spired city
ahead of him he broke into a stum--
bling run shouting hoarsely saved
the people of the city would give him
water how sweet it would taste 

  he stumbled on but the distance was
greater than it first seemed to inspire
his failing strength he peered at it
through the binoculars how hazy it
looked it wavered that must be his
eyes but there was water great foun-
tains of it cascading up in lush patches
of greenery there were even people 
one of the balconies staring at him he
waved but they stared stonily why
didnt they come out to help him

  he again took up his tottering lope
cursing at the loose sand that dragged
at his feet
prison of time



  suddenly through the fog of his
mind a terrible thought pierced a
mirage-it might be that no it
couldnt be-mustnt be

 yet what was such a great spired city
doing out in these wastes doubts
trooped through his agonized mind it
shimmered that city it wavered and
floated over the sand it wasnt real
it was a phenomenon of refraction an
image cast across miles of desert a
diabolical vision sent to torture him in
his last hour of life

  barry carvers mind was paradoxi-
cally shocked to calm and sanity by the
dread realization his poor burned feet
automatically propelled him toward the
wonderful vision his whole body strain-
ing forward but his mind clear and
rational told him he was chasing a
chimera

  another hour and it would be over
he would sink drained of strength to
the hot sands his information would
die with him the great war go on with-
out him perhaps some day a wander-
ing desert tribe would find his bleached
bones his epitaph would be written
in the drifting sands

  stumbling on refusing to lie down
and wait for death barry carvers eyes
appraised the city of the mirage with
almost philosophical detachment how
real it looked and yet how unreal dis-
torted by heat waves it seemed like no
city ever seen on earth its towers and
spires had a slim grace unknown to or-
dinary architecture it stretched right
and left and back interminably yet
beyond it through it he could see
plainly the hateful dunes and ridges of
the vast desert

  just a mirage no maybe it wasnt
maybe it was real he would find out
-lord madness stealing over him
again his right hand brought up his
automatic sweaty fingers gripping the
stock aiming for his temple better the
quick death by bullet than the tortures

of nightmarish insanity

  he flung the gun away suddenly

wiadness overwhelnyd his seeth-
ing mind the great citys gates
were opening massive steel halves that
swung silently apart on cleverly-devised
gymbals he could see now down into
the wide avenues row on row of build-
ings the people were beckoning to
him urging him on water a beau-
tiful splashing fountain of it   

  with voiceless shrieks from his burn-
ing throat the half-dead creature whose
name was barry carver lurched for-
ward he fell to his knees and began
crawling forward inch by inch toward
the mirage-city that seemed to dance
tantalizingly just beyond his reach

  now here was one side of the giant
portals he clutched at the pitted stone
but it was empty air he pitched on his
face and his groveling fingers found only
sand sand    and in a last moment
of calm before a black wave blotted out
his mind barry carver welcomed
death

  it was strange the awakening

  he was aware of physical lightness
and a queer sense of unreality but then
he opened his eyes and saw substantial
things he was in a bed under soft
silken coverlets the room around him
was white-walled curving to a domed
ceiling there were sylvan pictures of
haunting beauty long flowing drapes
spectrum colored carven furniture in-
laid with gold silver and ivory some-
how the motif of the room was orien-
tal-or ageless

  soft sunlight not the harsh desert
glare streamed in a window of crystal
clear glass carvers eyes were arrested
suddenly by what he saw over the foot
of the bed a woman a girl at second
glance seated at a table writing her
bronze-gold hair glinted in the sunlight

  carver essayed a call of attention


dynamic science stories

that came out as a feeble croak the
girl came forward instantly smiling
she wore a rich silken blouse rainbow
hued tucked in at the belt of baggy
trousers gathered at the ankles orien-
tal costume carver reflected in keep-
ing with the rooms furnishings

   but she herself wasnt oriental blue
eyes rose-white skin oval cheeks-they
were quite caucasian features strongly
irish in fact the contrast with her
clothing was startling and her smile
was friendly and open not inscrutable
and half-apologetic as with oriental
women

  cairo guessed carver concerned
first of all with where he was how
was i rescued-caravan

  cairo the girl looked puzzled
carver repeated his question in his
indifferent french hoping this would be
understood

  the girl laughed no i speak eng-
lish she said i was puzzled because
you mentioned cairo

  well where am i then pursued
carver khartoum or maybe-he
frowned-north coast - tripoli or
tunis in the enemys hands but in
that case how would you a white
girl- he stopped wonderingly

   the girls face had become grave i
see you dont realize youre in shor-
raine she said slowly well neither
did i at first

  shorraine echoed carver never
heard of it what part of africa
the girl shook her head not africa
nor any other continent shorraine is
the-city of the mirage

  carver gasped he stared at her si-
lently for a moment what reason
would she have for lying or was she
lying do you mean that city i saw
-the mirage-the big gate- he fin-
ished explosively i dont believe it
you will see soon returned the
girl calmly

  ill see now grunted carver he

tried to struggle up on his elbow ignor-
ing the girls plea to lie quiet

  youre weak you must rest

  but carver didnt have to be told as
a sudden wave of weakness turned his
muscles to rubber he slumped back
and a tide of darkness again buried him

ayhen next he awoke hunger
gnawed within barry carver the
girl was again there and turned at his
call im hungry he told her with-
out preamble incidentally im
barry carver of the united states air-
force

  im helene ward also of the uni-
ted states she smiled

   but you still insist this is the city
of the mirage he said half mockingly
right out in the middle of the sa-
hara a dream citv that floats ghost-
like

  she turned from a cupped wall instru-
ment into which she had whispered a
few words i wont try to explain now
after youve eaten put on those clothes
over the chair ill meet you outside
and-show you

  the door opened and carver gave a
start that shook his whole bed the
figure that entered bearing a silver tray
loaded with steaming dishes was squat
and hulking shouldered with thick
bowed stumps of legs his abbreviated
costume of sleeveless shirt and kirtle re-
vealed an ape-like hairness the fea-
tures were brutal-thick flaring nose
protruding lips receding brow

  but docile-like without a sound he
set the tray down on a taboret beside
the bed and retreated with a brief bow
of his thick neck toward the girl

  good lord breathed carver i
dont know much anthropology but that
was a neanderthal man what-

   ill meet you outside said the girl
slipping out

  the tempting odors arising from the
tray clipped short carvers amazed con-
prison of time



jectures he sat up finding himself
considerably stronger than the other
time and satisfied his inner cravings

  the food was exotic strangely spiced
but tasty he recognized no single in-
gredient of it but that it was nour-
ishing he had no doubt he could feel
new strength pulsing through his veins
at last he reflected he was no wraith
if this was the city of the mirage but
he hadnt made up his mind about that
it would require indubitable proof for
belief yet if it were some oriental
earth city what was a perfectly natural
white girl doing here and that nean-
derthal man

  barry carver put the dishes aside
hurriedly eager to get the mystery over
with as he swung his feet out of the
bed he noticed they were cleanly healed
of any sign of his terrible trek across
the desert either he had been uncon-
scious a lung time or had had expert
medical care probably both he tast-
ed faintly a drug that might have kept
him asleep

  the costume fitted his stalwart frame
perfectly an ornate sleeveless coat
narrowed trimly at the hips a broad
leather belt held up baggy trousers sim-
ilar to the girls for his feet there were
sandals of some soft hide he stepped
before a full-length mirror chuckling
whimsically at the bizarre contrast to
his blond wavy hair light grey eyes and
typically occidental face yet he had
the swarthy skin of an oriental burned
almost mahogany by the three days of
fierce sahara sun

  on a small table he found his binoc-
ulars automatic and compass he
picked up the gun and tucked it into his
belt somehow feeling better for it he
found a pocket for the compass he
carried the binoculars in his hand

  he strode to the window but couldnt
see much because of a high sill he
turned to the door it opened magically
at his approach and as he went past he

detected the faint photoelectric eye at
the side in a short hall stood the girl
helene smiling she led him to another
door that gave access to an open bal-
cony hanging like a crows nest from the
tower from this vantage carver saw
the full sweep and extent of the incredi-
ble city

cheer depth greeted him that took
 his breath away he was very high
in some tower nestled among a forest
of similar spires far below lay lower
flatter buildings and moving figures in
winding avenues dotting the expanse
of metal and stone were numerous areas
of green sward parks whose meander-
ing lanes were bordered with trees and
flowers

  barry carver knew there had never
been such a city on earth save in tales
of the arabian nights was the girl
right was this the city of the mi-
rage

  but its so solid so real he ob-
jected aloud as though they had argued
the mirage i saw was shimmering
ghostlike-as unsubstantial as an air-
castle

  shorraine exists in a different di-
mension explained the girl in this
dimension shorraine is real and earth
is ghostly look she grasped his
arm and turned him part way around
squint your eyes and stare straight
out

  he did back of him the suns bril-
liant shafts speared through the city
and suddenly he saw a quivering un-
real scene of endless hills of sand hov-
ering below and all around it was like
a superimposed view the desert faintly
occupying the space the city lay in he
opened his eyes wide and the illusion
vanished shorraine reared solidly
around him

  carver felt shaken at the weird op-
tical effect an axiom of physics rose in
his mind two things cannot occupy


dynamic science stories

the same space at the same time he
stated flatly how do you explain
that

  i cant helene admitted simply
they tried to explain to me but i un-
derstood very little of it

  whos they

  the ones who rule this city the
girl shook her head at his open mouth
ready to issue further questions youll
meet them later ill tell what i can
the huge front gate to shorraine en-
closes the spot at which earth and this
world contact when anything of
earth reaches the spot it passes on
through to this dimension

  at his wry smile she said sharply
im trying to be as clear as i can you
approached the spot attracted by the
vision of shorraine we saw you dimly
as you saw us

  then there were people waving
beckoning to me interposed carver
remembering

  yes we opened the gates for you
you stumbled at the end but fell within
the influence of the spot you had en-
tered our dimension we picked you
up unconscious from your experi-
ences she explained

  the girl looked at him sympathet-
ically you must have suffered a great
deal your feet were masses of blis-
ters you were feverish your throat
was so constricted we feared you would
choke to death lying senseless but
shorraine has miraculous medicines
you were quickly treated and brought
to this tower for rest

  how long has it been since i ar-
rived

  two days you were kept in a
drugged sleep to hasten your recov-
ery

  two days echoed carver he
looked down at his healed feet again re-
flecting that the medicines of shorraine
must indeed be efficacious and the
vigor that flowed through his body

when so recently he had been a half-
mad racked creature more alive than
dead it had been a toss-up probably
whether he would fall within the gates
of shorraine or through deaths doors

ttelene ward was watching him

	 do you believe now-about shor-
raine

  what choice have i sighed car-
ver though its all like a fairy tale
a city in a mirage-another dimension
-a neanderthal man-complete cures
in two days  he shook his head then
he swung on the girl and you-
youre a mystery tell me about your-
self

  she blushed a little at his stare
there isnt much to tell my father
led an archeological expedition west
from khartoum and never returned
that was a year ago her face was
grave now saddened  set out in
search of him in an airplane it cracked
up-bad air currents the pilot was
killed in the crash a miracle saved
me i was alone then and set out
across the desert

  she shuddered it was terrible
finally i saw the mirage-shorraine
the gates opened for me too ive
been here a year

  a year carver looked at her
you like it here youve never tried
to leave

  before the girl could answer there
was an interruption a young eager-
faced man strode from the door of the
tower he nodded to helene and
gripped carvers hand warmly

  heard you were up and about im
tom tyson of the good old usa air
squadron by the look of the togs you
arrived in id say youre an airman
yourself

  carvers eyes lighted he introduced
himself and went on what front were
you on jap european or south
american
prison of time



  hold on tyson stared at him
queerly there was only one main
front in my time-flanders field

  you mean- carver choked on
the words

 world war nodded tyson
strangest thing how i got down here
i was doing scout duty with a fast ship
and plenty of gas fog came up at
night compass went wrong i saw
water below once or twice and figured
it was the english channel next thing
i knew at dawn i was over the damned
desert i had crossed the mediter-
ranean  

  you did a douglas corrigan
smiled carver briefly

  exactly agreed tyson anyway
i ran out of gas over the desert with
no idea where i was forced landing
then the mirage the gates opening
and here i am in shorraine been here
since 

  but youre just a young man-
about twenty blurted out carver as
the astounding thought struck him

  helene and tyson glanced at one an-
other tyson spoke i guess youve
heard so many mysteries one more
wont hurt people dont age in shor-
raine he was about to say more but
compressed his lips instead

  carver stared helplessly could this
be some mad dream from which he
would eventually awake

  i was nineteen when i came to
shorraine continued tyson im still
nineteen physically but i know whats
been going on since then i know about
your war whats the latest develop-
ment

  the thought of the war suddenly
swept all other considerations out of
carvers confused mind the latest
development he muttered is a move
on the enemys part-a secret jap
army trying to cut through to the in-
dian ocean and i think im the only
one knows about it if they succeed

theyll sever our overland connection
between the european and japanese
fronts

lie drew himself up i havent time
a a to waste all these mysteries by
the board i have to leave shorraine
get back to-civilization warn head-
quarters of the jap move do you sup-
pose i can get some help here to cross
the desert

  carver saw again a look exchanged
between the two and wondered what it
was this time his heart sank in anti-
cipation even before helene spoke

  you cant leave shorraine she
said softly

  why not snapped carver impa-
tiently nobody can stop me if i
came in the spot i can go out again
the girl looked at him as though
warning him to prepare for the greatest
shock of all

  remember when you were stagger-
ing into the city gates she said you
must have wondered why we didnt
come out to help you you saw us
watching we couldnt come out the
spot only works one way

  tom tyson nodded soberly you
can come in from the earth side easily
enough but going back is impossible
it doesnt work or else id have left
here long ago

  good lord groaned carver you
mean theres no way back and i have
priceless information for headquarters
it should be delivered soon in another
month that jap army-

  theres no way back murmured
tyson

  carver grasped at straws is there
any way of communicating with the
outside world radio for instance
tyson shook his head radio also
works just one way-into shorraine
we know much of what goes on in the
world by radio but no radio waves
can go the other way to earth


dynamic science stories

  carver bit his lip what a mad im-
possible situation trapped in a mys-
terious dimension from which there
was no return a dismayed feeling
clutched his heart and not only at the
thought of his untransmitted informa-
tion he must continue to live here in
shorraine in a strange almost alien en-
vironment in a city of witchcraft to
judge by what he had heard and seen so
far

  barry carver whirled suddenly
listen there must be a way back to
earth he protested have you ever
tried the spot

  well no admitted tyson but
theyve told us-

  theyve told you carver mocked
why not try it he had never taken
anybodys word for anything when the
issue at slake was vital

  il right agreed tyson well
try it right now

  he led the way off the balcony into
the short hallway at the end of which
was an elevator that took them down
at a sickening pace they traversed
another hallway passing other people
carver stared at them curiously were
all of thc-m unaging as tyson was
how long coidd they be kept so but
he would find out such things later at
present his only thought was departure
from shorraine

  they stepped out into the sunlight
on a broad flat roof tyson spoke low
words with an attendant and then
jumped aboard a flat-decked craft built
like a half egg-shell carver followed
and helped helene aboard

  tyson stood before a pedestal whose
top surface held dials and levers as he
manipulated them a soft hum arose
from below deck and the craft glided
into the air smoothly carver hung on
the rail around the deck thunderstruck
by the fact that there was no propellor
whirring he flushed as he caught ty-
sons half-amused glance

  little different from the kind of
things we piloted eh grinned tyson
works on an anti-gravity principle
apparatus below produces a field of
force that neutralizes gravity power
comes from a central broadcast sta-
tion

arver swallowed his amazement
with difficulty it was becoming
apparent to him that shorraine was a
city of more than common science
neutralizing gravity was no small feat
and so far ahead of earth science that
they laughed at it as an optimists
dream broadcasting power through
the ether though long sought still
evaded engineering efforts on earth
both of these had been achieved here
and combined in a craft that soared
magically

  sailing high above the spires carver
had a panoramic view of the citys ex-
panse a circular stone wall a hundred
feet high completely surrounded it
beyond was wild-looking land appar-
ently uncultivated

  where is food grown queried
carver mystified

  it isnt grown informed helene
its nwde-here in the city by scien-
tific processes she smiled but
dont ask me how the wall around
shorraine is to keep out-beasts

  tyson slanted the ship down toward
the ponderous gates and landed it on
the wall next to a small housing the
gatekeeper a hawk-nosed fellow stared
at them quizzically

  open the gates commanded ty-
son

  but why asked the gate-keeper
turning to peer with squinted eyes be-
yond the city there is no one ap-
proaching from the earth-dimension

  no but we wish to try going
through the spot back toward earth
just for our own satisfaction spoke up
carver theres no harm trying is
prison of time



there

  the gate-keeper grinned at him in
recognition youre the man who ar-
rived recently there is no return to
earth others have tried it-countless
others

  i want to try for myself insisted
carver stubbornly

  the gate-keeper scowled all right
he said grumblingly after a moment
go down below but do not go too far
outside the gate i saw one of the big
beasts roaming around before

 tyson led the way down winding
stairs to the base of the wall carver
was in a fever of impatience to attempt
the return despite the repeated pessi-
mism against its success finally the
massive halves of the metal gate swung
outward without a whisper of sound

  the three waiting stepped forward
out toward the dark wild wastes
squinting his eyes with the sun in back
of him barry carver could see the
mirage of earth before him the vast
ocean of the sahara it hung over the
other scene like a dancing image was
there no return to it

  they trudged forward out of curi-
osity carver took out his compass and
glanced at it the needle pointing away
from the city as north suddenly spun
wildly as he walked along a few feet
further on it was pointing into the city
in a queer reversal that was like an ill
omen

  altogether they walked forward a
hundred yards but the earth-mirage
did not become real

 you see said tom tyson but
with disappointment himself

  i had been hoping-a little mur-
mured helene

  carver looked back baffled he could
see the outline of the spot like a round
bluish tunnel in the air filling the space
between the gate posts they had
walked right through it it offered no
return to earth he was convinced of

it now he shrugged and turned to go
back

  oh

it was a gasp from helene her fin-

	gers dug into his arm he looked in
the direction she indicated and gasped
himself out of the dark land was
charging a monster of scales and spines
rearing twenty feet from the ground
rooted in surprise carver recognized
it a tyrannosaurus from the rep-
tilian age of the dim past it thun-
dered down on them a juggernaut of
bone and muscle

  run shouted tyson they fled
for the gateway but carver felt futile
despair they would never make it be-
fore the monstrous killer caught up
with them he jerked out his automatic
and emptied it at the creature though
he realized it would have as little effect
as tossing pebbles

  fifty yards to go carver pushed the
girl before him and glanced over his
shoulder giant jaws edged with rows
of horrible teeth were almost within
striking distance death at his very-
back

  and then-from the top of the wall
stabbed a crimson beam hissing
through the air it caught the beast
squarely and burned smokingly through
armored scales screaming shrilly it
spun about and raced back the way it
had come with a thunder of its pon-
derous feet

  safe within the gates trembling and
panting the three watched the great
portals swing together

  a dinosaur growled carver
what else have you got in this crazy
world he was more angry than as-
tonished for his sense of surprise had
become dulled with repeated reve-
lations

  when they had climbed to the top of
the wall the gatekeeper was shoving a
wheeled weapon back to its niche in the


dynamic science stories

guardhouse carver could see an intri-
cate group of tubes coils and wiring be-
hind a mesh-screen connecting to a
shiny convex mirror it was powered
probably from the ether broadcast
lines and shot out raw heat energy as a
beam again an example of advanced
science

  thanks proxides said tyson
warmly we owe our lives to your
sharp eyes and quick action

  t h e gate-keeper grunted these
eyes that are trained to watch for the
demon-peoples slinking shapes cannot
fail to see a mountain of flesh before the
nose and in the old days-his eyes
flashed slightly - one had to learn
quickness in the hand-to-hand battles
with the persians ah in those times


  the buzzing of a wall instrument in-
tervened

  carver turned to see a square panel
glow with prismatic colors that sudden-
ly flew together to form a face tele-
vision-and far clearer than the images
cast by the latest  models on earth

  a bearded sharp-nosed visage peered
out of the visi-screen

  proxides he barked for whom or
what reason did you open the gates

  for the new man sire who did not
believe there was no return to earth

  i see the eyes shifted to meet
those of carver and he felt as though
he were looking inlo pools of endless
depths i will explain to him some-
time when i am not so busy the im-
age faded

  whos he asked carver

  chief scientist of shorraine said
tyson if you want a scientific ex-
planation for everything val marmax
is the man to give it

  then lets see him right away de-
manded carver

  cant while hes busy but ill ar-
range for you to see him as soon as
possible

nd right now spoke up helene
ward youre going back to
your room and bed youre still a con-
valescent too much excitement at one
time

  i feel fine carver protested

  doctors orders said the girl firm-
ly youre not as well as you think
yet

  youre taking pretty good care of
me smiled carver

  the girls face tinted and she low-
ered her eyes without answering by
the time they had flown back to his
room carver realized she was right a
strange weakness had stolen over him
an after-effect of the drugs he sur-
mised in bed he fell instantly asleep
too tired to conjecture over the amazing
riddle of shorraine

  for the next three days while his full
strength rapidly returned barry car-
ver lived a strange dream helen and
tysonwho spent most of his waking
hours with him had obviously entered
a conspiracy to explain little or nothing
tyson assured him that soon he would
be told all things by one more qualified
to make it clear val marmax the sci-
entist

  in fact in the many hours they spent
on the balcony conversing helene and
tyson asked the most questions they
were pitifully eager almost to hear of
events in their former life they drank
in his words the picture of rapt atten-
tion

  we hear much of what goes on in
the world by radio informed tyson
but its dry second-hand and we
cant ask the announcer questions
since the wars been on weve heard
less because i suppose of stiff censor-
ship we hardly know what is going
on right now

  carvers eyes went bleak

  its the greatest conflict in human
history he murmured with science
prison of time



let loose as a ravening brute it all be-
gan with the assassination of hitler
over a year ago it was a mistake he
became a martyr in the eyes of his
world-wide followers two months later
they rose in attack inflamed by the
other leaders every nation became in-
volved on one side or the other if the
enemy wins - dictatorship all over
earth 

  he jumped up and began pacing
hands clenched i keep thinking of
that jap army it must be stopped i
why did i have to fall or crawl into
this damned trap

 you wouldnt be alive if you
hadnt reminded helene gently

  well youre right admitted car-
ver his shoulders sagged helplessly
ill have to make the best of it

  he saw an exchange of looks between
the other two as though they too at one
time had come to such a conclusion

  tyson took them flying at times over
the city he taught carver the tech-
nique of handling the controls and it
was with some pleasure that carver
maneuvered the ship at breathtaking
spurts and spins it was far superior
in manipulation to clumsy propellored
ships he thought vaguely of such
craft in the war on earth and what a
tremendous advantage they would be in
any aerial battles

  the second day high over the city
carver noticed a break in the horizons
beyond which elsewhere was an un-
broken expanse of dark wilderness
faintly he seemed to see the spires and
serrate outlines of another city

  is it a city he asked

  tyson nodded his lips tightening a
little

  well

  its a city of-other people
vouched tyson reluctantly

arver stared at their averted
   eyes

  you two are keeping a lot from
me he accused

  helene touched his arm youve
only been here a few days barry she
said softly you cant learn of every-
thing at once val marmax will ex-
plain better than we can

  carver let it rest at that though his
impatience and wonder grew hourly
his two guides took him through the
various industries of shorraine robot
machinery almost unattended made
the necessities of life including food
all raw material came from simple rock
molecules by processes of transmuta-
tion power to run all machines as
with the aircraft came wirelessly from
a central power-station this gigantic
plant was crammed to the roof with
busily humming cyclotrons carver
vaguely understood it as the generation
of atomic energy

  and here was all this science in full-
bloom cooped up in some isolated di-
mension it was the science of
earths future but how wonderful to
have it now if only earth could have it

  the people of the city interested
barry carver the most however
though dressed uniformly in the color-
ful costumes of their style they were of
all races including a sprinkling of chi-
nese and negroes the predominant
white in turn was of all different types
from almost black asiatic indians to
pink-white nordics the main bulk
however seemed to be an olive-skinned
sharp-nosed people

  ethnologically the citizens of shor-
raine were a mixed group and carver
sensed too that they were divergent in a
subtler way that he couldnt define
snatches of conversation that he over-
heard mystified him there were re-
ferences to the past that puzzled him
but most amazing of all when he
stopped to think of it was the wide-
spread use of dozens of different lan-
guages and particularly when he no-


dynamic science stories

ticed a swarthy indian talking german
a chinese using french a blonde nor-
dic rolling off the difficulties of greek

  it was always with a queer shock that
carver came upon the silent unobtru-
sive neanderthal men they served
a s well-treated menials apparently
their little dull eyes reflected the mud-
dled mind of a creature half-way be-
tween man and ape earth anthropolo-
gists would mortgage their souls for one
of them

  on the third morning of his awaken-
ing helene informed him in a rather
subdued voice that he was to be re-
ceived by the queen

  your ruler asked carver

  no she was a queen in her for-
mer life and out of courtesy the title
remains she makes it a practice to
welcome all newcomers to shorraine
helene turned away with a strange
hunch of her shoulders she turned
back suddenly if you wished you
could pass it by

  no ill see the queen said car-
ver interested he quoted a royal
invitation is a command

  tyson joined them and together they
soared to a tower of elaborate design
frescoed and studded with blocks of
sparkling stone at the landing terrace
a bowing hawk-nosed attendant ush-
ered them into a room hung with gor-
geous tapestries statuettes gleamed in
wall niches perfume lingered in the
air on a couch of silks reclined a
woman in a clinging robe of white

  her majesty queen elsha an-
nounced the attendant solemnly with-
drawing

arver stared almost rudely he
v- had never seen a woman quite like
her before raven-black hair ran
smoothly over the ears to outline an ol-
ive-tinted face of dark heavy-lidded
eyes thin aristocratic nose and lips
crimsoned artificially one hand with

gold-tinted nails toyed with the ears of
a woolly dog curled beside her the
langorous lines of her figure were a
study of artistic perfection

  she was staring at him a faint smile
on her lips

  you are barry carver most recent
pilgrim to shorraine her voice was
low husky melodious you will tell
me about the outside world that i have
not seen for-a while

  anything you want to know queen
elsha assured carver flushing a little
at her direct gaze he felt himself be-
ing appraised weighed almost ana-
lyzed and seemed to see a gleam of ap-
proval in those slumbrous eyes

  she glanced at the others may i
not be alone with my guest

  carver saw helene dart a veiled
glance at the woman and then turn
away with that same little hunch of her
shoulders tysoa managed to whisper
a word in carvers ear before he left
with a cynical grin dynamite
alone wifh the creature who seemed
the essence of oriental womanhood
carver felt at a loss he could feel his
ears burn

  sit down beside me barry carver
she invited her english was fluent
natural tell me about yourself

  he did briefly then he asked
what were you queen of before you
came to shorraine he reflected it
must be some comic-opera principality
perhaps in asia minor

  her eyes lighted of a great land
but that is no more a fiercer expres-
sion shone from her dark eyes then
i should still be a rightful queen but
they have taken my power away in
shorraine she peered up at him
will you help me regain what i have
lost barry carver you are a leader
 know that at first glance you could
do much-for me

  carver stammered a negative star-
tled at the sudden appeal
prison of time



  no

  her arms were suddenly around his
neck drawing his lips to hers the
exotic perfume of her hair hypnotized
his senses but a word flashed through
his mind dynamite

  i have to go he said firmly pull-
ing himself away he left without a
backward glance and soared away in
his ship

  helene was waiting at his tower
well she said with a trace of cold-
ness

  well what he countered

  you were there a half hour said
the girl pointedly when the queen
welcomed me it only took five min-
utes she turned with that queer
hunch of her shoulder

  carver laughed and drew her to him
i love you helene he said simply
from the first moment

  she resisted him youve only
known me three days how can you
know-

  three days three minutes three
years- -whats the difference hel-
ene-

  carver was determined sure of him-
self he hadnt been sure of it before
the episode with queen elsha had
served to crystallize his own attitude to
the sweet attractive girl who had been
nurse and companion for three days

che held herself stiffly as he slipped
 his arms around her but suddenly
relaxed in surrender sought his lips
eagerly

  oh barry take me away from this
place-back to earth  she half sobbed
after a moment

  ill certainly try he promised

  tomorrow she whispered to-
morrow val marmax will see you
youll hear the full story she shud-
dered then youll know

  in the morning tyson was on hand
val marmax is waiting for us barry

he says he will explain many things
good nodded carver so far
ive seen things that need plenty of tall
explaining he set his lips grimly if
im to be stuck in shorraine i want to
know the why of everything coming
along helene

  she slipped her hand in his i think
i want to hear what val marmax has to
say too ive been here a year earth-
time and its all a mystery to me
why do you say earth-time
asked carver having heard the expres-
sion several times is there a different
time-system in shorraine

  let val marmax explain said ty-
son shortly

  their flat-decked ship arose smooth-
ly and darted in the direction of the
citys gates a short distance before
them lay a long low building in the
shadows of sky-piercing towers land-
ing on the roof the way led down wind-
ing stairs finally before a door of
burnished metal tyson pressed a but-
ton soft lights flashed in their eyes-
carver guessed it to be a vision scanner
-and then the door opened

  not unfamiliar with laboratories
carver recognized the room beyond im-
mediately as such but little of the
paraphernalia strewn about on benches
and shelves was that of earth-science
the aspect of the place was foreign
strange and somehow age-old car-
vers heart beat faster for some inde-
finable reason

  val marmax was seated at a desk be-
fore an instrument whose rotating me-
tal scroll made some kind of record
but the scientist was neither speaking
nor writing he was just staring at a
small humming globe over the machine
in a flash of insight carver knew he
was recording his thoughts directly on
the scroll

  the three stood silently waiting
finally the scientists thin sensitive
hand flipped a switch at the side and the


dynamic science sioiries

machines hum ceased he looked up
carver met his eyes far more than
the vision screen had showed that other
time they were orbs of dynamic inten-
sity they seemed filled with the wis-
dom of ages shining forth like a steady
beacon yet behind this carver sensed
a deep weariness for the rest he was
an average man about forty somewhat
portly with a lofty brow pointed beard
and full lips

  at a querulous glance from the scien-
tist tyson gave carvers name

  the things of shorraine mystify
you barry carver spoke the scien-
tist in a deep grave voice i will an-
swer your questions i am val mar-
max chief scientist of shorraine

  from where are you queried car-
ver first of all unable to place the mans
precise accent

  from atlantis

  atlantis carver looked blank
then he gasped atlantis again
sharply  it took him a few seconds to
regain his lost voice but you cant
mean the mythical island of prehistory
- he stopped looking at his two com-
panions but they showed no surprise

  val marmax nodded with a faint
smile that same ill-fated land of
twelve thousand years ago earth-
time

arver tried to rationalize he
could accept offhand the one-time
existence of atlantis though in earth
history it had always been a fable but
must he accept val marmaxs state-
ment at face-value an impulsive
laugh that he couldnt control shook
him

  youre not twelve thousand years
old he objected you mean youre a
descendant of that race

  no i am an original atlantide as-
 serted the scientist proxides at the
 gate is a greek from the time of alex-
 ander  bc there are people in

shorraine from all times and periods
from the days of atlantis to the pres-
ent

  remember barry came tysons
voice i told you people do not age in
shorraine

  tyson of course was an example
himself carver reflected though he
hadnt followed through the reasoning
before he had simply taken it for
granted that some miraculous scientific
process like a fountain of youth kept
him young and would do so for a lim-
ited time but this survival of val
marmax through centuries was a dif-
ferent matter it was immortality

  carver forced himself to be calm is
there no such thing as death here he
asked quietly

  only by violence and occasionally
by disease never by what is known
on earth as old-age the scientist
went on our science has conquered
most disease which is really a death by
violence through the attack of germs
actual violent death however we can-
not control if that tyrannosaurus
outside the gates had caught you one
snap of his jaws would have ended
your life as certainly as on earth
but old-age remonstrated carver
how do you escape that

  we are in a different time-world
than that of earth responded the at-
lantide it is hard to explain in terms
of your orthodox modern science in a
sense time does not pass here in shor-
raines world or rather call it bio-
logical time old-age is a wearing
down of the body-machine measured
by biological time and biological time
stands still here there is no simpler
explanation

  carvers eyes rested on helene
what of your children good lord
if death is so rave how have you kept
the population from choking itself by
sheer pressure of numbers

  helene looked back at him queerly
prison of time



sadly carver noticed and he suspected
the answer the stunning thought oc-
curred to him that he hadnt seen a
single child in three days

  there are no children in shorraine
val marmax was looking at the floor
now there can be none birth and
growth arc processes dependent on bio-
logical time again we have no senile
old dotards ready for the grave but
neither have we children to grow up at
our sides that has been the price of
immortality in shorraine

  carver broke a strained depressed
silence he sensed that val marmax
and perhaps all the others of shorraine
would willingly exchange this immor-
tality for normal life

  the pathway back to earth is
closed as i know he said but have
you tried with your science to open the
way

  infinite weariness suddenly came
over the atlantides face

  i have tried and many others for
these thousands of years it seemed
impossible the spot can be simply ne-
gotiated from earth to shorraine but
the return is barred as though earth
were in the remotest galaxy and
therein lies the whole story of shor-
raine

iie settled himself back his eyes

a  faded as though he were plumbing
the depths of time with his vision

  the world of shorr-which in our
tongue means mirage-lies in a differ-
ent universe than that of earth there
are different stars and different dimen-
sions the two do not conflict though
they lie wrapped in one another they
are in different time-sectors and as
your einstein has shown partly two
things can exist in the same space at
separate times

  h e waved a hand of dismissal
having studied the problem for so
long i could show you the formulae

but they are too involved for ordinary
discussion

  carver nodded skip it he said
he realised that the riddle of shor-
raine was something earth science s
rigid dogmatism hadnt made allowance
for

  the atlantide resumed

  shorr however does have contact
with earth at the spot to give an an-
alogy it is something like a two-dimen-
sional flat world touching a three-di-
mensional globe they would contact
at one point thus since time began
there has been this path from earth to
this world-one-way

  as a result creatures of earth
blundered through the spot into this
dimension all other conditions save
time being strangely alike they lived
in the dim past millions of years ago
the great reptiles came through during
their era of predominance the sa-
hara in those remote times was not a
desert but a rich prolific hotbed of life
and by the laws of numbers alone
though the spot is so small many dino-
saurs entered in my idler moments i
have soared over the dark lands and
catalogued triceratops brontosaurus
stegosaurus trachodon etc they
too were unable to die of age but their
numbers have been depleted by their
mutual depredations the tyranno-
saurus you saw is the only one ive
known of in fifty years he may well
be the last of his species in shorr

  carver heaved a sigh the pieces of
the puzzle were falling into place and
in a less crazy pattern than had at first
seemed possible

  eventually continued val mar-
max man came on the scene per-
haps through a period of fifty thousand
years all the sub-species of near-man
wandered in before the dawn of true
man the neanderthalers particularly
entered the spot terrified bewildered
by the new world they did not venture


dynamic science stories

far from the spot and established a
cave community exactly on the site of
later shorraine they managed to eke
out a living by hunting

  we found them here when we came
-we of atlantis

  the scientists voice became tense
vibrant

  fifteen thousand years ago atlantis
and mu achieved a cultured scientific
civilization that lasted for three thou-
sand years then came catastrophe as
your fables relate the seas rose the
lands split and the fires of the under-
neath erupted atlantis and mu were
doomed-

  something of the terror and agony
of that long ago disaster shone from the
speakers eyes carver felt sympathy

  some of the scientists of atlantis
knew of the spot knew that it led to a
livable world as they could faintly see
in mirages while there was yet time
we gathered as many of our people as
we could led them into shorr better
a chance for survival in an unknown
world than certain death on torn
twisted earth some few of mu from
half way around the world were also
saved queen elsha - was queen of
that great land in the pacific

arver started a little thinking of
his visit with queen elsha and her
strange conversation

  val marmax sighed

  thus we began life anew with our
science we founded the city of shor-
raine-mirage city-on the site of the
neanderthal cave-home the few sur-
viving neanderthalers we trained as our
servants life was not unpleasant in
shorr but we soon longed to return
particularly when we knew at the im-
mortality that denied us children
then we found-that we could not re-
turn

  the furrows in the scientists brow
-sharpened by twelve thousand years

of life and thought-grew deep

  though we prided ourselves as be-
ing the masters of nature and all its
mysteries we could not solve the prob-
lem of the spot life went on in the
past twelve thousand years others have
wandered into the spot from later
times than ours when the egyptian
empire flowered thousands of them
came to shorraine later men from
all lands-sumerians persians greeks
romans crusaders arabs and the
european adventurers not in great
numbers of course only by chance
sometimes only one a year since the
days of egypt when the sahara became
a death-trap only doomed men whose
half-maddened minds saw the mirage of
shorraine as possible rescue have stum-
bled in as with yourself

  are all the mirages of the sahara
asked carver curiously caused by
shorraine

  val marmax nodded all mirages
so-called are reflections of our city
from different angles or views of the
rest of shorr earth eyes have dressed
them with many fanciful details but
they would have noticed by compari-
son that it was one and the same gen-
eral scene each time

  and that mused carver explains
one of the oldest of historical phenom-
ena

  he looked at the atlantides studied
face it was hard to believe that this
man had lived three hundred lifetimes
that the city was filled with other peo-
ple whose lives had gone past the bibli-
cal three-score and ten

  carver was suddenly appalled how
have you filled the time he whispered
all those centuries and centuries-

  we have managed to occupy our-
selves smiled val marmax his smile
was mirthless the repairs and run-
ning of our machinery beautifying our
city and the pursuit of hobbies earth
history has particularly absorbed us
prison of time



collectively each new visitant to shor-
raine when he had become settled in
the new life was set to work writing
down all he knew of his times we have
written records that would be priceless
to earth-detailed accounts of early
history lost to your times another pop-
ular avocation has been to learn differ-
ent languages almost every person in
shorraine can speak fluently in dozens
of languages it takes time-but ishtu
knows we have enough of that

  carver saw now though he had taken
it for granted before why everyone in
shorraine seemed to know english thor-
oughly they had studied it over the
the radio as they had studied all other
modern languages they had probably
spoken it longer than carver himself
like that greek proxides who had
been born a thousand years before the
rudiments of the modern english lan-
guage had been set down everything
in shorraine was topsy-turvy it was
all queer queer

  i suppose its been interesting in a
way remarked carver living on
and on learning many more things than
normal humans ever have a chance to
but which would you rather have-this
life or life on earth

 he visage of val marmax suddenly
unmasked itself as an incredibly old
senile wearied face behind its ageless
lines

  earth he said instantly his eyes
glowing we would welcome release
from this deathless prison i have lived
twelve thousand years in shorraine i
would exchange it for  years of earth
life life is a meaningless purgatory
here immortality is ashes twelve
years back on earth would be fuller
richer grander- he stopped help-
less to express himself you will find
out barry carver when you have
watched the slow years parade by end-
lessly endlessly-

  i dont intend to find out said car-
ver rebelliously there must be a way
out of the spot

  val marmaxs sigh came from his
soul

  i have chanted those same words for
twelve thousand years he said he
became suddenly fierce scornful for
twelve thousand years ive tried-and
my science has failed and you say
childishly it can be achieved as though
it were a tent-flap one could toss aside
carver took the rebuke in silence
beside him tom tyson stirred if
there only were a way he murmured
ive only been here twenty-four years
but id take a day on earth for another
twenty-four even an hour in a dog-
fight against enemy planes knowing i
couldnt escape them

  the war carver had almost forgot-
ten about it he jumped up and began
pacing its all so ironic he com-
plained in a mutter you people would
gladly go back to earth and earth
could use your great science your
atomic-energy process wireless power
transmission chemical food robot ma-
chinery and your marvellous anti-
gravity ships and beam-weapon in the
war if we had your help we would
win

 val marmax nodded i have
thought of that myself i have fol-
lowed your war by radio reports what
puny guns and methods you have i
could rout an army with ten of my
ships

  carver whirled

  suppose the spot were open he
demanded and you could go out
you would have to choose a side which
side he almost held his breath wait-
ing for an answer

  that would be up to the council
returned the atlantide non-commitally
five of my fellow atlantides rule shor-
raine but they would call a council for
a decision the council would consist


dynamic science stories

of one member from each kind of race
time and nation the five have ruled
wisely that way through the voice of
the people

  democracy cried carver happily
you have it here yourself they would
vote to help the allied democracies
perhaps so val marmaxs eyes
were dull but foolish talk it will
never come to pass are you still think-
ing of conquering the spot barry car-
ver when  have failed in twelve thou-
sand years

  carver felt the crushing force of that
statement his eager thought of shor-
raines help in the war evaporated leav-
ing bitterness he felt helenes eyes on
him and looked at her she had hope
she seemed to be telling him she be-
lieved in him believed he could do some-
thing against all reason

  carvers pulses stirred he faced the
atlantide

  just what is the spot he asked
why is it so impregnable

 al marmax spoke dejectedly

  	its a time-warp in brief passing
through from the earth side all elec-
trons within the countless atoms reverse
their spin which throws them into the
new time dimension but to force the
electrons back to their original motion
seems impossible it involves attaining
a high potential i have tried the ti-
tanic powers of atomic-energy without
avail it is an irreversible equation ap-
parently of time-

  magnetism interjected carver
thoughtfully

  what asked the atlantide

  it must be a magnetic phenom-
ena carver related his experiment
with the compass when passing through
the spot

  magnetism--compass what are
those val marmax looked puzzled

  carver stared his thoughts whirling
could it be possible that this master

scientist knew nothing of magetism

  how do you generate electricity
he demanded

  by conversion of disrupted atoms
into pure energy

  you dont use a generator-an ar-
mature copper wire magnetic field
the atlantide shook his head still
puzzled

  good god exploded carver a
blinding light seared his mind too
much science thats your trouble he
hissed youve been playing around
with your anti-gravity atomic-energy
and what-not without realizing there
are such simple things as magnetic
fields rotating coils and plain ordinary
two-plus-two ill bet the key to the
spot is so simple youll cry like a baby
when you find it

  val marmax rose in red-faced anger
glaring at the younger man for a mo-
ment he stood thus haughty proud
wrathful in a pose that might have
been a picture of a long-distant past
when he and his fellows w-ere lords of
civilization but suddenly he relaxed

  this magnetism he asked what
is it

  barry carver launched into an ex-
planation and halting though it was
he knew he had put the idea across
an utterly dumbfounded look had
frozen on the atlantides face

  ishtu he gasped thats it the
vital clue at my fingertips all the time
if the polarity is reversed the electrons
must spin the other way-

  radiant with hope the four looked
at one another

  then suddenly carver felt a queer
sensation something dark and shad-
owy seemed to be in the room it hov-
ered over him and darted down sud-
denly he felt strangely light-headed
and something was prodding in his
mind like a mental gimlet it burned
agonizingly as though his brain were
on fire
prison of time



  instinctively he brushed at the shad-
owy thing around his head trying to
knock it away his hand felt nothing
save a tingling-and the burning tor-
turing probing feeling continued

  the other three had been staring at
him frightened

  dont think barked val marmax
make your mind a blank carver
youre in danger-think of nothing
nothing-

  while he spoke he ran toward the
wall where a row of gleaming switches
lay carver bewildered and half-pan-
icky tried to obey tried to make his
mind a blank he pictured sheep
jumping over a fence one sheep-two
sheep-three sheep- he noticed the
burning in his brain lessening

  and then suddenly it vanished alto-
gether he was free val marmax
had thrown a switch followed by a
deep humming sound that seemed to
fill the room with an intangible force
the black shadow rose to the roof and
vanished with a soundless scream

itelene was in carvers arms

  a then clinging to him wordlessly
he looked down in her face and saw
horror there was something else in
shorraine or shorr than these other
mysteries he disengaged her gently

  what was it he asked frowning
at the dull ache that remained in his
head

  the demon-people helene mur-
mured

  the demon-people-the city beyond
shorraine-vague snatches of things he
had heard failed to dove-tail in carvers
mind he looked quizzically al he sci-
entist

  i havent told you the full story of
shorr confessed val marmax shorr
of course is a separate world from
earth it has its own-creatures we
of shorraine are outlanders invaders
in hat sense the higher life-forms

have achieved civilization-of a sort
their largest city is just fifty miles

away

  wht are they like carver
queried

  he saw the quick looks of loathing
in their faces they arent-human
in form answered the atlantide he
seemed reluctant to continue the topic

  you mean this shadow-thing was
one of them

  no they have definite form but
they have a strange science tangent to
ours they are able to project astral
forms one of them the shadow-thing
was sent here to probe your mind-to
read it

  for what carver was astonished
val marmax shook his head i
dont know but i suspect it was to
find out what you knew of magnetism
you see they too have a spot connect-
ing with earth i didnt mention it be-
fore but shorr and earth impinge at
two points according to their axis of
rotation we built shorraine around
the one bul the demon-people kept con-
trol of the other

  carver whistled ill say you didnt
tell me the whole story in fact only
half this complicates matters con-
siderably what of the earth-people
who have wandered into their spot
poor devils it was tyson who
spoke somberly having to live on
and on as slaves of he demon-people
suicide is probably the way out for
many of them

  the demon-people i take it are
bitter enemies of mankind carver
suggested

  they are different in all ways in-
formed val marmax their forms
minds aims science-everything if
they once had the chance to invade
earth through their spot they would
trample down civilization ruthlessly
we must be careful in our work on
spot-penetration that they dont steal

the secret i have this laboratory pro-
tected from their astral-spying how-
ever and we can safely go on

  carver wanted to ask more questions
still quite hazy about the enemy but
val marmax waved an impatient hand
i will tell you more some other time
right now-his eyes were charged
with exultant hope-you must show
me how to build a simple magnetic cir-
cuit from that ill learn about this
unbelievable phenomenon - one that
has somehow escaped all the science of
atlantis

  carver was already rolling up his
sleeves wheres some copper wire
he smiled whimsically at the thought
that he was going to show a twelve
thousand year old scientist who could
blow mountains to atoms how to make
a magnetic needle twist like a live thing

  the following week in his new
strange world was a busy one for bar-
ry carver he spent long hours with
val marmax imparting to the scientist
all he knew about magnetism the at-
lantide caught on quickly his trained
mind leaped the gaps of understanding
at an accelerated pace in a week val
marmax had learned as much about
magnetism as it had taken earth sci-
ence a century to uncover carver was
already out of his depth but continued
to help as laboratory assistant

arver had less time than he
 wished to spend with helene and
tyson the girl particularly in his
eyes she grew more lovely every day
and for that reason carver was almost
rude to queen elsha who dropped in
the laboratory at almost any odd hour
carver alert began to wonder what
game she was playing she was not the
sort to do things aimlessly

  on the third day she ran across the
annoyance of val marmax intent and
nervous as he was in his work

  elsha may i ask you to leave

  she drew herself up haughtily heavy-
lidded eyes insulted you forget i am
a queen val marmax she purred
dangerously

  were a queen reminded the at-
lantide tactlessly and never mine
anyway

  carver saw her quick humiliated
flush and had an inkling of her feel-
ings he almost pitied her once
proud queen of a great people in a
glorious era and now a common mem-
ber of a democratic society surrounded
by an indulgent pretense of her former
royal authority it must hurt-espe-
cially through twelve thousand years of
memory

  perhaps she saw the sympathy in his
face she turned to him ill leave
but will you dine with me tonight
barry carver sometimes i am so-
alone

  at the point of refusing carver fell
under the hypnosis of her eyes they
were pleading he was surprised to
hear himself say yes

  she swept her cloak about her glori-
ous figure and left

  val marmax shook his head shes
a queer case he confided she saw
much of the destruction of her land
mu she almost lost her mind for a
year in shorraine she brooded and
even tried suicide but she came out
of it and since then has created a new
empire-of lovers she has had the
pick of men from the lowest to the
high

  carver glimpsed a dreamy look in the
scientists eye but said nothing smil-
ing to himself the things of shorraine
if ever the world heard about them
would fill many libraries

  ushered into the queens presence
that evening carvers heart beat faster
she was a dream of brunette beauty
clothed in sheerrobes with soft strate-
gically placed lights to bring out her
loviiest charms almost he retreated
prison of time



but again a subtle magnetism gripped
him perfume mounted headily to his
intoxicated mind

  she told him of mu as they ate a
heavenly land in a golden era it was
a spell of enchantment with her low
husky voice lulling his senses a rich
synthetic wine more delectable than any
he had ever tasted in earth did more
to confuse him till he had forgotten all
but her witching presence dimly in
the back of his mind he thought of her
past her real age but it was a lost voice

  the food cleared away she sat close
beside him on the couch

  kiss me she commanded softly

  carver gripped himself youre a
queen he tried to say casually

  not tonight she whispered to-
night im a woman-a lonely one i-

  carver leaning toward the alluring
lips caught something in the corner of
his eye a black something his con-
fused mind tried to snap alert that
black thing was-danger

  with a cry he leaped erect and
pulled from his belt the hand-projector
that would spray high-frequency waves
through the room val marmax had
given it to him as a protection against
astral visitants the black formless
shadow about to envelop his head quiv-
ered and puffed soundlessly into the
ceiling passing through matter as
though it didnt exist

carver snapped off the instrument
the shadow-things of all the
queer things in shorr decidedly ap-
pealed to him the least

  queen elsha did not seem too dis-
turbed it is nothing new she said
sit down barry

  no the spell had been broken
and carver realized how close he had
been drawn to something unworthy i
wont be next on your list queen el-
sha

  she flushed angrily you think you

love that helene child she blazed

  im going to marry her said
carver

  you prefer her to me wretch it
was the queen of mu talking imperi-
ously she has washed out eyes skin-
ny limbs a simpering smile what can
you see in her fool

  youth said carver brutally frank
turning to leave he had one glimpse
of her face before he left-a blaze of
fury what was that expression about
a woman scorned carver laughed
and forgot about the queen of ancient
mu

  the following day tom tyson
brought the news that carver was to be
given an official welcome to shorraine
by its rulers

  carver smiled after ive been
here ten days picked its number one
beauty as my future wife and started
collaboration with its chief scientist

  what is time in shorraine mur-
mured tyson with a reflective air that
betrayed the middle-aged maturity be-
hind his boyish face once through
an error an italian of columbus time
lived in shorraine for a century before
the five heard of him his entrance-
date corresponding to birth in shor-
raine was never fully settled in the rec-
ords

  the headquarters of the five were
contained in the central and highest
towers of the city a combination of
palace and business office here were
hundreds of clerks and administrators
conducting the daily affairs of shor-
raine and its million inhabitants it
was a smooth-running organization
long since brought to perfection as
nearly as man could achieve

  the receiving room of the five was
bare simple a symbol of their own cog-
nizance that they did not rule shor-
raine autocratically dressed no differ-
ent than the rest the five atlantides
were old patriarchal in appearance


dynamic science stories

their eyes shone as val marmaxs had
with calm cool wisdom they looked
at carver as though weighing him on
the spot as they doubtless had so many
others in their long past

  one of them stepped forward

  welcome to shorraine he said in
the perfect english carver had come to
expect but he started a little as the
atlantide thrust out his hand in a ges-
ture that likely had never been known
in atlantis carver gripped it warmly
tyson grinned

  i taught them that he whispered
in an aside

  since there is no return from shor-
raine spoke the atlantide you bar-
ry carver were a citizen of our city the
moment you arrived as such you will
respect and obey the laws of shorraine
and the common good we are not your
rulers we are a living constitution
never ourselves deciding the application
of fundamental articles laid down ten
thousand years ago when this govern-
ment was founded you understand

d ealizing there was no stilted
a formality in this carver nodded
and then asked what of the first two
thousand years

  evolution of government smiled
the atlantide nodding as though com-
mending the question during the
building of the city everyone worked
with a will to found a lasting home
then came the thought of government
in two thousand years many forms
were tried at times-his eyes grew
a little sad-there was even struggle
revolution also for a century a des-
pot ruled and there was near chaos he
was assassinated finally anarchy too
prevailed for a while but the light
shone through and at last we found the
happy combination of personal liberty
and communal cooperation that pre-
vails today it has lasted ten thousand
years

  democracy stated carver

  it is nearest to that in your time
agreed the atlantide but-superior
carver couldnt doubt that of a form
of government that had been matured
four thousand years before the egyp-
tians on earth had broken away from
tribal rule he realized that if the spot
were conquered one of shorraines
most magnificent contributions to earth
civilization would be a perfected model
of government tried by the fire and
sword of time and without dictator-
ship

  and now the atlantide resumed
we have been informed of your work
with val marmax his grave eyes
shone eagerly we hope you succeed
in penetrating the spot in that event
perhaps many of our citizens will prefer
to go back to earth but some will re-
main and there will be intercourse be-
tween shorraine and earth we have
long awaited the day

  carver looked at their five face

  i think we will succeed val mar-
max is hopeful he paused there
is a great war out there today as you
must know would shorraine help the
side of the allied democracies against
the threat of dictatorship

  the peoples council would decide
the atlantides voice was non-commit-
tal but carver read much in their
glances at one another when the
spot is definitely penetrated a council
will instantly be called if our interven-
tion in the war is voted upon the de-
tails of ships and armament will imme-
diately be settled

  good enough said carver

  on the way to val marmaxs labora-
tory in their ship carver thought again
of the japanese force he had spied strik-
ing into vulnerable allied territory

  how soon could shorraine he
asked send out an aerial force

  	quicker than you think tyson
spoke excitedly ive been thinking it
prison of time



over a lot since you and val got to-
gether there are at least ten thousand
light fast ships mounted with the
beam-gun theyd be a match for ten
times their number of earth ships-at
least the world war kind top-speed
 miles an hour can turn on a dime
with gravity-brakes beams range-
a mile power-source one cabbage-
sized atomic-motor fuel one hatful
of sand lasting  hours how does
that stack up with your modern ships
okay asserted carver but id
need more you cant stop an army
with that you need bombs to blow up
and cut off all ground lines of communi-
cation and reinforcement

  all right how about one thousand
ships big ones used around here for
hauling building material they could
carry all the bombs you could load on
the deck atomic-bombs-one would
make a mountain fold up

arver grunted in approval but
 how long to turn out all that the
jap army i want to stop if possible will
smash through in three weeks

  robot machinery reminded ty-
son overnight practically his
eyes glistened boy the chance to
bring a few more boches down you
have more than boches in this war but
the enemys the enemy ill finish up
where i left off in the last war

  if we get through the spot carver
was suddenly pessimistic perhaps the
spot was impenetrable and all his hopes
built on sand was it possible for his
simple suggestion of magnetism to un-
lock the door to earth when shor-
raines super - science had battered
against it in vain for twelve thousand
years it almost seemed too much to
hope for

  it was just a week after carvers first
visit with val marmax that the scientist
set up his experimental apparatus with-
in the spot the giant gates of shor-

raine were open tyson and helene
were there and proxides was on guard
against beasts but no others the gen-
eral populace had not been informed
some few watched idly from the nearer
avenues and windows unaware of the
importance of what they saw

  carver had helped set up the tripod
upholding the apparatus a small pow-
erful electromagnet keynote of the in-
strument hummed as val marmax sent
power hissing through it from a nearby
atomic-generator the scientist indi-
cated the slow twist of a magnetic nee-
dle

  when it points straight out toward
earth the way should be open he
washed his hands in the air nervously
anything thrust through the magnetic
field should reverse the spin of its elec-
trons-enter the normal earth dimen-
sion ishtu be kind

  finally the needle pointed quiver-
ingly straight through the spot like the
finger of fate the machine sang as its
energies battled the strange time-stric-
ture the space through the field-coils
of the magnet turned from blue to soft
yellow the glare of the sahara car-
ver crossed his fingers in hope

  val marmax drawing a breath
tossed a ring of metal through the mag-
net out toward the mirage of earth
they ran to the other side the ring
was not there the atlantide lighted
a peculiar handflash in whose circle of
strange rays the sands of earth stood
out clearly he played the ultra-light
around till suddenly the metal ring
leaped into sight

  it had gone through the spot safely
it rested now in the time-dimension of
earth

  val marmax stood motionlessly
then staring as though he couldnt be-
lieve carver wondered what his
thoughts must be he who had striven
ceaselessly for twelve millennia to ac-
complish this miracle the scientist

turned suddenly to look at shorraine
it was the glance of a man who sees re-
lease from an age-long prison

  tyson broke the silence

  if that space was big enough id
crawl through right now he threat-
ened

  carver swept helene ward into his
arms youre going to get your church
wedding darling he declared any
church you want-on earth

   on earth echoed the girl happily

  i suppose i should wish you two ev-
ery happiness

 i hey turned startled it was

	queen elsha they hadnt seen her
come up from the shadow of the wall
she gazed at them a queer mockery in
her eyes as though they were children
who amused her apparently carver
thought she bore him no animosity for
their last meeting

  thanks queen elsha carver ac-
knowledged but realized that she had
not actually given the wish

  her dark eyes turned interestedly on
val marmaxs spot-penetration appara-
tus the way is open-to earth she
murmured at last

  and this sentiment came in a rising
murmur that wafted from the towering
city at their backs up on the wall
proxides had yelled into his televisor
with the swiftness of light the news
went around the city faces began to
peer from all windows roofs from ships
that darted gracefully near a city of
immortals raised its voice in thanks to
a hundred different gods that the ada-
mant walls of the prison of time had
fallen

  val marmax gripped carvers hand

  you showed me the way he said
with frank honesty it is done the
time-warp can be simply negotiated
back to earth

  j want ships to go throueh the
warp aaid carver practically

armed ships to help my side in the
war-our side can you build some
kind of large magnet for that purpose
no there is a better way returned
the scientist thoughtfully ill have
individual units made spraying out the
magnetic force to be mounted at each
ships prow they will sail right through
the spot then into the earth dimen-
sion

  good carver was jubilant but
work fast a fleet of ships must leave
within two weeks every minute
counts

  the scientist smiled i have lived
for twelve thousand years now sud-
denly every minute counts it is as
though fates threads had all suddenly
gnarled strange but ill work out
the indivdual units tonight he prom-
ised he went on a bit pridefully
your science gave me the key i
needed but i will in one night work out
what any of your scientists would take
a year to devise

  can i help offered carver

  no but i think helene can she
knows shorthand she has helped me
before ill dictate all data specifica-
tions and plans for their manufacture
to her tomorrow the factories will
begin turning them out

  carver suddenly whirled jerking out
his high-frequency pistol he sprayed
its forces over the spot apparatus a
black shadow that had been slinking
around its contours swirled off into the
sky

  an astral spy exclaimed val mar-
max the demon-people are trying to
steal the secret we must be on guard
my laboratory is protected from them
but tomorrow when we begin manu-
facture of the units we will have to
guard the factories his face was pale
better that we never had found the
way than that the demon-people should
invade earth

  barry carver spent a busy evening
prison of time



first he went to the five informed
them of the experiments success and
asked for the council on war they
readily agreed to call it the following
day then with tyson he had written
down tentative plans for a war fleet to
be presented to the council when ty-
son left carver called the laboratory
helenes sweet face ghosted into the
visi-screen

  busy darling

  yes but happy

  i keep worrying about those damned
black shadow-things carver muttered
are you sure youre safe there
perfectly assured the girl half
chidingly val marmax has taken the
added precaution of having his whole
laboratory surrounded by guards armed
with beam-guns in case the demon-peo-
ple tried to spy around in person now
dont worry and get some sleep youve
been driving yourself too much all
week

arver hung up with a restless
 feeling now that events were
coming to a climax his mind seethed
with vague fears he stepped out on
the balcony looking over the city of
mystery it lay like a tinsel fairyland
in its own towerlights incredibly beau-
tiful age-old weird he looked up
there was no moon in shorrs skies
only a firmament of strange fiery stars
perhaps the native people of this world
had charted them into constellations of
their own his hand unconsciously
gripped the butt of his wave-gun as he
thought of the demon-people and their
eerie astral wanderings

  he heard the buzzing of his visi-
phone and went to answer it the face
of elsha queen of mu greeted him

  barry carver she pleaded i
want to see you its important please
come over right away

  no snapped carver

  she argued and all the while her eyes

were on his he tried to fight their in-
fluence but again a subtle hypnotism
cast its spell agreeing finally he re-
flected vaguely as he went to the ship
terrace that mere man could not fight
the magnetic allure that the woman had
built up in twelve thousand years of
practice but he promised himself sav-
agely that he would tell her once and
for all to give up the chase pointed
insults would repulse even her

  he stepped into the witchery of her
presence and the straight-laced words
he had thought up came out haltingly
she smiled through it all though he
sensed the suppressed fury behind her
lidded eyes

  all right barry carver i under-
stand she said calmly i drink to
your happiness-with the woman you
choose

  carver did not think of her odd use
of tense in the words till he had drunk
half his glass in relieved courtesy to the
toast he set the glass down

  what do you mean-choose i
have chosen already

  he glared at her but suddenly his
eyes swam his brain reeled he stag-
gered to the couch almost falling
elsha was close now peering into his
eyes-waiting the thought ham-
mered in carvers mind that the drink
had been drugged

  the woman you-chose repeated
the queen of mu and you choose me
you love me barry

  and suddenly it was all clear to
barry carver he loved her the queen
of mu of course she was a glo-
rious desirable woman how had he
ever thought helene ward was the one
his head sank to her shoulder bab-
bling words of devotion came from his
lips his voice seemed to come from
somewhere outside of him from a vast
roaring distance

  then hers though in his confusion he
could scarcely understand what she

said i will be queen again a queen
needs a king beside her on the throne
you will be my king barry beloved
more than any other man in twelve
thousand years you are my choice we
will rule shorraine you and i even
after the spot is opened they have
promised me that

  carvers head came up dizzily
king rule he mumbled i dont
-understand dim instincts of warn-
ing worked within him he staggered
to his feet

   yes go now barry she said go
back to your room and sleep tomor-
row it will be clearer to you you will
come to me in the morning

jviuttering carver stumbled to
a a his ship elshas servant quietly
piloted him back to his quarters in
bed carvers thoughts were a dizzying
turmoil he was sure of only one thing
-that he loved elsha queen of mu

  he awoke with a hand shaking his
shoulder frantically it was still night
with dawn about to break tom ty-
sons boyish face aged now by some
urgency peered down at him

  get up barry his voice was
hoarse somethings happened i just
got the call from proxides and came
over to take you along

  what happened demanded car-
ver fully awake

  tysons lips worked val marmax
is gone taken bv force by-

  yes

  the demon-people tysons young
 face looked haggard

   carver dressed hurriedly and in a
 short while their ship descended to the
 great gates parapet proxides came
 forward nursing an arm whose bicep
 was a torn bloody mass that he had
 hastily bandaged

   just touched me as they went by
 he growled jove curse them-

   carver stopped his flow of greek in-
vective the whole story from the
beginning

  i saw the ship slant down to val
marmaxs laboratory i seldom sleep
at night time enough in the day it
landed on the roof a few minutes
later i saw a flash of a guards beam-
gun on the roof the ship swung up
and some blasting force from it laid the
guards out like sticks as it slanted
past me i took a pot-shot at it and got
this he touched his arm it was
the demon-people i saw their devilish
eyes

  but why didnt you sound the alarm
when you first saw the ship groaned
carver and the guards-they let
them get into the laboratory

  it was queen elshas ship re-
turned proxides

  carver gasped looking at tyson

  thats the only reason they suc-
ceeded said tyson queen elsha is
allowed to go anywhere she pleases at
any time without question she has
always done so she must have helped
them

  confusion rose in carvers mind
could she have done such a traitorous
thing leagued herself with the demon-
people and last night-had she
drugged him perhaps to make sure he
wouldnt interfere with the abduction
it was a horrible indictment against the
woman he was unwilling to believe
it

  theres one other thing barry
tyson spoke slowly helene-was
taken too

  carver shook for a moment he stood
stiffly conquering a wild rage then lie
motioned to the laboratory they de-
scended to it on the roof lay the bod-
ies of the slain guards bloodily torn as
though by some internal bomb tyson
explained from what he had heard that
the demon-peoples weapon was a tele-
kinetic disrupting force
prison of time



  down below they found a group of
bewildered guards conversing the lab-
oratory was a ruin obviously blasted by
the force-weapon not one scrap of
val marmaxs scientific labors on the
spot-penetration was left the guards
story was the same as that of proxides
no one had bothered to watch who or
what came out of queen elshas ship
in the darkness of the roof suddenly
they had heard noises screams by the
time they had arrived from their vari-
ous posts the ship was gone the dam-
age done

its all plain muttered tyson

  queen elsha led them below they
worked fast secretly and now the
demon-people have val marmax in
their hands theyll force the spot se-
cret from him-invade earth

  come on cried carver were
going to see queen elsha about this
if shes there said tyson she
may have gone along with them-

  but they found her in her apartment
weeping loudly even her tear-strained
face was incredibly beautiful on the
floor lay her servant in a pool of blood
from his own shattered skull

  i know something terrible has hap-
pened she sobbed an hour ago the
demon-people came here and took my
ship they killed my servant tied me
she pointed to strips of silk on the floor
i just worked free what did they do
with my ship she stared at them
with innocent apprehension

  the two men looked at one another
if it was acting it was magnificent ty-
sons lips writhed

  pretty thin alibi queen elsha he
snapped you know very well that
val marmax and helene ward were
abducted guards killed you were
there

  the woman gasped as though the
news stunned her then she rose with
outraged dignity dog how dare

you  she spat at tyson did you see
me there did anyone see me there
how can you make such unfounded ac-
cusations

  tyson growled yes some of the
guards saw you

  carver waited to see the effect of the
bluff for any guards that might have
seen her were dead for himself he
was in a quandary he had seen no
sign as yet of guilt in her words or at-
titude she might be the picture of in-
nocence she presented

  queen elsha tilted her face haughtily
ignoring tyson she turned the full
power of her glorious eyes on carver
barry this boy is insulting me but
you arent suspicious of me are you
she held out her arms you havent
forgotten last night-kiss me barry
carver made no move except to
shake his head last night-what a
fool i was he murmured

  for the first time the womans eyes
showed perturbation but you love
me she declared

  no denied carver i dont know
what kind of drug you gave me last
night but i know that the effects have
worn off i-

  he was interrupted by a sharp cry
from queen elsha her hand went to
her mouth and she fell back a step
some violent emotion worked within her
-disappointment frustration then
hysterical rage

  they tricked me she raved
they told me it would last for years-
forever she was sobbing again-
genuinely carver sensed-and rapidly
going to pieces

  carver leaped forward his own fare
working he grasped her by the shoul-
ders and shook her whos they-
the demon-people out with it wom-
an or ill- he raised his hand
threateningly determined to get the
truth out of her

  she didnt wince at the gesture


dynamic science stories

something else forced her to speak
within herself yes the demon-peo-
ple oh what have i done her
tones were almost a shriek

  carver forced her back on the couch
and slapped her face lightly no
hysterics he ground out why did
you do it

  composing herself with an effort she
looked up at him

  for you she murmured unhappily
and for my-kingdom i wanted you
from the first barry no man in
twelve thousand years has ever stirred
me more and your resistance your
scorn drove me-mad 

che swallowed and went on in a dry
defeated voice they came to me
in astral forms i made a bargain with
them-for a love-philtre the demon-
people have a strange science almost a
sorcery the philtre would give me
your love and in return i would help
them abduct val marmax also i was
to help them conquer-shorraine
among the men who man shorraines
defenses i have many devoted-
friends they would do my bidding
let the demon-peoples ship past to at-
tack the city in return for that after
the conquest i would be made queen
of shorraine even later of part of
earth

  carver listened with incredulous
amazement monstrous bargain yet
dimly he could understand it had
rankled in her mind for twelve thou-
sand years that she had once been a
queen and she had never before been
balked in love most likely in a mad
moment she had seen the chance to at-
tain both her desires bargained with the
enemy sold out her people with cold-
blooded indifference

  good god woman groaned car-
ver do you realize what a horrible
thing youve done i dont know much
about the demon-people but youve

given them the chance to invade earth
if they worm the spot secret out of val
marmax and then kill him we wont
even have a chance to warn the outside
jvorld

  the proud queen of ancient mu hung
her head it was madness she
moaned if i could only undo it
too late now growled tyson his
eyes reviled her he turned to carver
something has to be done

  carver was pacing the thick rug
frowning in thought theres only one
thing i can see attack the demon-
people-now stop them from going
on destroy them completely if pos-
sible

  tyson shook his head afraid it
wouldnt be so easy barry theyre
well armed the city fortified shor-
raine has had battles with them before
trying to fescue the poor souls theyve
enslaved arriving through their spot
but surely the science of shorraine
is superior to theirs

  they have their own weapon and
ours returned tyson gloomily
through the centuries theyve man-
aged to steal scientific secrets with their
damned astral spying they even have
robot machinery modeled after ours in
a drawn-out war theyd have the su-
periority of numbers too we might
win though even against those odds
he shrugged fatalistically i suppose
its the only course left

  wait

  carver whirled on the queen of mu
when are they supposed to attack
shorraine

  the woman looked up spiritlessly
tomorrow

  and they dont know- carver
suddenly jerked out his high-frequency
pistol a black shapeless shadow had
slithered into the room it puffed away
with its peculiar telepathic scream as
the wave-gun hissed
prison of time



   they must be suspicious resumed
carver but they dont know that
v---en elsha has told her story shor-
raine will meet them tomorrow with full
force let them wear down their forces
a little attacking then shorraine can
attack he went on rapidly in the
meantime you and  will go to the
demon-peoples city

tyson stared well be killed or
 captured what-

  queen elsha will take us carver
said tersely as converts friends to
their cause or something anything
just so we get into their city safely we
have to try rescuing val marmax and
helene

  it was a wild scheme carver knew
but every moment that val marmax
was in their hands counted against
shorraine-and earth and helene-
he wouldnt have a moments peace till
he saw her again stood at her side no
matter under what circumstances
im game tyson said simply
will you do it queen elsha
queried carver get us into their
city on some pretext

  she started as though coming out of
a worried dream anything you say
barry she agreed tonelessly any-
thing to-atone

  before the five a short time later
carver gave the full details in brief
phrases the alarm had rung through
the city over the abduction but none
had known the full story the five
looked with terrible scorn at queen
elsha and she shrank visibly

  elsha said the spokesman you
have done an incalculable harm five
hundred years ago you fomented a
minor revolution among your-friends
you gave a promise afterward never to
again raise trouble which youve
broken now your punishment-
never mind that snapped carver
now that its done the important

thing is stopping the enemy she has
to take us into their city well do what
we can to rescue val marmax in the
meantime protect shorraine from their
attack tomorrow and then attack
them-whether we come back or not

  the atlantide nodded we will
have the council place us on an imme-
diate wartime footing he glanced at
carver you are a brave man barry
carver we wish you luck for your
own sake as well as for the good of
shorraine-and earth

  a few minutes later the craft bear-
ing the three soared up and darted over
the spires of shorraine wild looking
land unearthlike in aspect flew be-
neath them strange slinking monsters
crept in the shadows of mushrooming
vegetation far in the distance once
they saw the hulking shape of some
earthly dinosaur carver shuddered
shorr was a forbidding depressing
world small wonder that the immor-
tals of shorraine would eagerly leave
it at the price of death

  phoryx the city of the demon-peo-
ple climbed over the horizon like a
black cubistic monster copied partly
from shorraines slim grace it was a
twisted parody as though insane minds
had been the architects the building
material was all of blacks and hideous
blues and purples the demon-people
likely saw lighter colors only as greys

  when they had approached within a
mile tyson brought the ship to a halt
hovering on its anti-gravity plane

  were liable to get shot down if we
go any closer without being expected
he explained

  carver saw a black astral shape ma-
terialize over their heads queen el-
sha shook her head as he was about to
draw his wave-gun she was more com-
posed now and wailed calmly as the
mysterious thing settled about her head
like an intangible vampire

  she seemed to listen for a moment


dynamsc science stories

and then spoke aloud i wish to see
sha-tahn it is important again a
pause they are friends of mine-and
of phoryx i have a plan relating to
them for sha-tahn to hear

ttie astral body hovered for another

	moment and then darted up from
her head it floated to the prow of the
ship and moved forward as though
guiding the way

  follow it the queen of mu saitl
to tyson it is well so far we will
have an audience with sha-tahn ruler
of all the demon-people ill contrive to
find out from him where val marmax
is kept prisoner

  and helene added carver he
looked at her grimly were taking a
big chance with you queen elsha i f
you try to betray us- he patted the
heat-gun in his bell suggestively

  tyson took a breath and moved his
levers to follow the astral guide it led
them slanting down to an immense
building facing a great gate of dull
metal the other spot through it
if they had the chance the denizens of
shorr would swarm toward earth

  they landed on the roof carver no-
ticed with a wry grin that the buildings
several towers all leaned poor struc-
tural engineers their ghostly guide led
them into the gloomy interior the
halls were so dimly lit that they could
barely see their way the demon-peo-
ple hated light carver conjectured he
saw several dark forms solid ones but
couldnt make out their shape he
hadnt as yet seen one of the enemy and
wondered what theyd be like

  they finally brought up against a
corrosion-stained metal door the
astral being went through but the visi-
tors had to wait till it opened the
chamber beyond was more lighted and
carver strode in with the feeling of
walking into a lions den

  he stopped short after a few steps

his lower jaw dropping he stared at
the creatures gathered in a little semi-
circle they were satyrs the satyrs
of mythology with furred bestial
bodies hind hooves arched tails from
the waist up they were faintly human
with manlike arms hands and shoul-
ders the faces were satanic-pointed
ears flaring noses protruding jaws and
lips and tiny horns at the temples re-
pulsive alien inimical

  carver would have been less sur-
prised to see creatures with five legs or
two heads but satyrs out of the pages
of mythology-coincidence or not he
felt himself at the verge of a blinding
revelation

  he tore his eyes away from their gar-
goyle countenances to look around
his heart leaped as he saw helene at
the side held firmly by the arms she
called his name but he had to ignore
her playing his part he tried to tell
her with his eyes that he was supposed
to be a renegade helper of queen mu in
the plot against shorraine

  queen elsha playing her part spoke
these are two men who have griev-
ances and will help fight against shor-
raine

  one of the black-skinned satyrs set
off from his fellows by a mitre-like hat
leaned forward in a carven seat rolling
his redly gleaming eyes over them he
smiled slowly it was evil incarnate

  you lie he stated in hissing eng-
lish i read your mind before with
my astral projection we are masters
in such things the big man is barry
carver here in the attempt to rescue
val farmax

co suddenly and completely exposed
 carvers instinctive reaction was to
jerk out his heat-gun but two of the
demon-beings had already leaped like
deer and wrested it out of his hand
then they held his arms in viselike
grips tyson was similarly disarmed
prison of time



beside hiiy

  queen elsha stood in mute dismay
carver saw that now clearly she un-
derstood how she had been duped and
led on by the enemy to her own undo-
ing

  the leader of the satyrs thrust his
brutal face forward

  i am sha-tahn he announced
ruler of phoryx these are my lieu-
tenants-he pointed down the line-
zoroaster belial beelzebub python
asmodeus merizim apollyon asto-
roth mammon you have heard the
names before earthman

  carver gasped those were the
names of all the evil gods in mans re-
ligious history and sha-tahn-was
that satan what mad riddle was this
more baffling than anything else in
shorr

  the satyr ruler answered in part
we have been able to project our as-
tral images into earth-by a psychic
science you would not understand-
and in some manner sway the lives of
men in the past but soon we will
sway them completely you barry
carver have made it possible with the
secret ofmagnetism look

  he swept an arm and some of the
satyrs stepped back beyond them as
carver peered closely in the dim light-
ing he saw val marmax for the first
time he reclined on a couch eyes
closed breathing slow around his
head almost obscuring it was an astral-
shadow pulsating like a mental leech
feeding and it was nearby scrib-
bling busily on thick slates a dozen
satyrs recorded the telepathic messages
from the astral prober

  carver lurched forward angrily but
the satyrs held him back he realized
what they were extracting from val
marmaxs mind-the secret of spot-
penetration

  suddenly the satyrs stopped writing
the astral shadow vanished as one of

them punched a switch on a panel val
marmax sat up dazed agony leaped
into his eyes mental agony he spied
carver started and then shook his
head

  they have the secret barry he
groaned i tried to resist- he be-
gan sobbing brokenly

  yes and from the girl we have al-
ready extracted another secret spoke
sha-tahn relating to the earth war-
that a japanese army marches to the
indian sea

  carver jerked did these devils-
literal devils-plan to help the dicta-
torship coalition

  partly reading his thoughts again
sha-tahn nodded

  when we have penetrated the spot
we will smash all opposition to that
army we will bring victory to their
side helping in other campaigns it
will be an easier way to gain dominance
of earth-our long-awaited aim we
will bargain with the dictators and be-
come earths new-religion

  he was leaving much unsaid carver
sensed something unspeakably horri-
ble lay behind his matter-of-fact plans
rage shook carver you have no
right to meddle in earths affairs he
shouted you dont belong in earth 
sha-tahn grinned evilly we have
had more to do with earths affairs than
you know have you ever heard of a
man possessed of the devil possessed
of our astral projection many of your
conquerors of past history were guided
by us in that way but they always
fail at the last this time they wont
he waved his arm to another dark
corner of the chamber carver saw a
line of men humans standing stiffly
their eyes were wide unblinking lips
straight features emotionless a word
flashed in carvers mind-zombies
mindless dominated creatures-pos-
sessed of the devil poor unfortunates
who had staggered through the spot


dynamic science stories

from earth into evil phoryx

arvers eyes flicked down the
line and then stopped on one figure
angular face lick of hair over the fore-
head small mustache-hitler no he
must be wrong mad to think so he
looked again and knew he could not be
mistaken carver staggered in the re-
alization the demigod whose assassi-
nation had precipitated the great con-
flict on earth-alive here in phoryx
madness

  then carver remembered the pecu-
liar circumstances surrounding the for-
mer dictators assassination his plane
flying over the sahara on a visit to
newly gained african colonies had
been attacked shot down in a deep-laid
assassination plot but when the wreck
of his plane had been located the next
day all bodies were accounted for ex-
cept his obviously he had survived
the crash staggered away and reached
shorr exactly as carver had

  you see said sha-tahn i have
military earth minds for leadership in
the campaign to bring about a smash-
ing victory for dictatorship beside
the man you know stands genghis
kahn from the past who unknown to
your history was exiled to the desert
and reached shorr and those others
-generals and conquerors all they
will rule earth and we of phoryx will
be its-religion 

  carvers mind rebelled it was all
such a frightful maze involving earths
past present and future phoryx a lit-
eral hell whose spawn of evil would
soon burst out over earth like a poison-
ous tide

  and in the final analysis carver
himself was to blame

  but enough barked sha-tahn
take the prisoners away we will
check the spot-penetration data if it
works they will be killed we will
have no more need lor them they are

dangerous alive he turned as for
you queen elsha-

  you deceived me she shrilled
you told me the love philtre would
give me his devotion till the end of time
its effects were over the next morning
that is why i betrayed you

  carver had to admire her sudden de-
fiance in the face of a probable death
sentence

  rash creature said sha-tahn
calmly i wanted to test you i can
make the philtre to last longer-weeks
years i will give you another chance
queen elsha go back to shorraine
and reduce its defenses it must still
be destroyed

  the queens manner changed in-
stantly from fear to wild hope and
barry carver will then be left alive-
for me she demanded

  the being known as sha-tahn hesi-
tated and then nodded but with a hid-
den mockery in his eyes that carver
saw he thought of warning the queen
against trusting a-devil but he
shrugged he knew the queens treach-
erous nature wouldnt listen to reason
besides it wouldnt make any differ-
ence to him in any case

  the queen of mu looked at carver
with a rapt eager gaze then she
whirled on her way back to further be-
trayal of shorraine

  witch of hell hissed carver
queen elsha stopped glanced at him
once then went on leaving the room

  carver looked around was it hope-
less to think of escape from these
fiends he caught tysons eyes saw
the question in them and the spirit or
daring they had come in the attempt
to rescue val marmax against odds
why not try it now carver winked
slightly

a s their captors pulled at their arms
to conduct them away carver
braced his feet and jerked free tyson
prison of time



did the same and the two launched
themselves at the guards holding helene
and val marmax carver jabbed at
the nearest satyrs ugly face evading
his clutching hands and was grimly
satisfied to see him rock on his heels
then he swung from the floor and
knocked him cleanly off his feet-or
hooves

  take that you black- the crack
of tysons hard fist on an unprotected
chin supplied the rest tyson continued
to revile them punctuating his words
with lightning jabs

  the satyrs fought back clumsily
crowding around they were inordi-
nately light despite their bull-like build
and knew nothing of the art of fist-
fighting squealing and shouting they
milled about exposing themselves to
stiff-arm punches that made their necks
snap back

  carver felt a grim pleasure as his
powerful blows found their marks hu-
man brawn was decidedly superior to
the demon-peoples futile efforts with
their sudden unexpected onslaught the
two earthmen were able to clear the
space around val marmax and helene

  come on panted carver to
that side door- he grabbed the
girls arm and leaped in that direction

  look out-guns screamed hel-
ene

  some of the satyrs had drawn wicked
looking tubular weapons and were aim-
ing them then sha-tahns bull-voice
roared out

  no take them alive

  carver had not stopped running
just as he had figured they would be
safe from weapons sha-tahn would
not kill them before he was sure the
spot-penetration had been solved

  the four earth-people reached the
wide open doorway and dashed through
into the corridor beyond carver had
no idea where it led to but they must
keep their freedom and hope for a

break when they were half way down
the hall figures came at them from
ahead but human figures

  dull-eyed moving stiffly they
blocked the passage and from behind
came the sound of hooves beating
against the hard floor in pursuit
caught

  carver peered narrowly at the men
blocking the way slaves of the demon-
people they were but they were hu-
mans behind it all you men he
barked at them help us

  they did not answer hardly seemed
to hear they had the look of hypno-
tized automatons they made no move
to clear the way in fact they crouched
forward menacingly

  sorely youd help us rather than
your masters raged carver but they
stared stupidly uncomprehendingly

  no use cried val marmax
their minds are enslaved

  then here we go through them-
carver lowered his head and charged
tyson following promptly there were
six of them but they offered little com-
petition to the two berserk fighters by
the time the satyrs had come up from
the rear their party was through

  poor devils panted tyson hated
to hit them like striking dumb ani-
mals

  they ran fleetly down the dim hall
with the satyrs close on their heels a
large circular chamber opened before
them with several cross corridors lead-
ing out again

  a satyr stood at the wall speaking
into one of a series of small horns set
among numerous studs and switches
from the several corridors at the same
time came more of the mind-dominated
human slaves carvers mind sharp-
ened by the danger they were in clicked
with lightning inspiration he leaped
at the lone satyr who turned with a
snarl and rammed his fist against his
chin with all the power of his shoulders


dynamic science stories

the satyr slumped against the wall and
sagged like a stuffed dummy his head
lolling from a broken neck

rthen carver thrust his face before
the same horn into which the satyr
had been speaking stop he yelled
do not harm the earth-people  ex-
ultantly he saw out of the corncr of
his eye that the men rushing at them
had obediently stopped they were un-
der his control through an amazing in-
strument that somehow ruled their
minds

  thus when the satyrs came up they
were met by their own slaves in battle
as carver rapidly gave orders through
the horn tyson yelped in pure joy
thats holding the fort barry now
if we can find a way-

  he stopped and choked

  carver whirled and saw something
black and tenuous around his head one
of the astral shadows then three
more darted down from the roof car-
ver reached for a wave-gun that wasnt
there in his belt and then tried to beat
off the shadow that crouched down on
his head his hands passed through the
astral shape unhindered

  and then he felt his brain on fire as
something dug into it with mental fin-
gers helene and val marmax stared
at him in hopelessness they could not
fight off that which had no physical be-
ing nor could they shake their minds
free carver tried with all the will at
his command till the sweat started out
on his brow but the weird psychic
force threw a suffocating cloud over his
mind he relaxed numbly

  sha-tahns voice came to them
through the astral contact with the
sheer clarity of telepathy you have
amused me in your efforts to escape
ive used the astral force as a last re-
sort you will not escape phoryx go
now to your prison

  under the dominance of the astral

force which firmly gripped their cen-
ters otf will and locomotion the four
captives stepped into one of the corri-
dors like robots they marched along
with the black shadows perched over
their heads like incubi carver felt the
bitterness of defeat he tried to step
close to helene touch her hand com-
fortingly but even that was denied him
thoryx he realized was truly a-hell

  imprisoned together the four hu-
mans looked at one another in despair
val marmax sat with his head bowed
tyson strode up and down cursing un-
der his breath helene shuddered in
carvers arms he mechanically patted
her back but his mind was elsewhere
it seethed tortuously with the incredi-
ble revelations of phoryx city of hell

  i cant believe it he muttered
have these demons been behind all the
devil-worship and mal-practice in hu-
man affairs since history began

  val marmax nodded

  their science has delved deeply into
mental phenomena-telepathy teleki-
nesis astral projection clairvoyance
they were able to reach mens minds
even through the spot and play havoc
at times the babylonian devil-cults
pagan religions medieval supernatural-
ism your own salem witchcraft debacle
-all were manifestations of their in-
trusion into earths affairs by their psy-
chic science the alchemists astrol-
ogers and other pseudo-scientists often
worked under their domination the
love-philtre with which they bribed
queen elsha is a strange formula of
theirs somehow able to upset human
emotions evil by nature they can only
think of creating evil on earth

its a sort of scientific explanation
 mused carver for all the unex-
plainable things in human history he
thought of something theyre per-
fect satyrs ox greek mythology whats
prison of time



the connection there

  they once invaded earth directly
the atlantide admitted some un-
known genius of theirs penetrated the
spot about three thousand years ago
some hundreds of them went through
we of shorraine attacked blew up the
machine and its inventor with it those
in earth tried to build up a great pagan
religion but it died when they died and
survived only as mythology

  but no bones of their have ever been
found objected carver

  their bones dont ossify returned
the scientist simply he went on all
other tales of vampires ghosts gnomes
specters demons genii and various
supernatural monsters are a result of
their astral projections roaming earth
in strange shapes and forms

  but what has been their purpose
puzzled carver trying to rationalize
it seems rather-pointless

  pointless echoed val marmax
his eyes went bleak shorr is a poor
world earth is rich they have been
trying all that time to find some way
of making the astral projections gain
substance and live on earth earth
alchemists and so-called necromancers
were unwittingly helping them all the
time it follows closely some of the
actual earth literature about demons
in another dimension incantations and
exorcising were an attempt to gain the
earth dimension through strange psy-
chic-laws our science doesnt reveal
luckily it was not so easy to give their
astral projections actual earth life the
closest they came to it was from absorb-
ing freshly split human blood hence
their instigation of wars-and the in-
stitution of human sacrifice in pagan re-
ligions

  carver felt stunned nauseated

  the atlantide resumed but the
few astral projections who did gain sub-
stance died quickly or were killed
here in shorr their method of repro-

duction is of that type-totally non-
sexual they send out astral forms
these wander over shorr absorbing the
blood of newly slain animals years
later they are matured-have sub-
stance but on earth they have al-
ways failed since their astral projec-
tions through the snot were weakened
yet they want earth they would even
accept its death-cycle because they
could increase their numbers limitlesslv
-at the expense of human lives

  so our penetration of the spot by
magnetic means falls right in line with
their plans muttered carver they
will invade earth-in person theyll
multiply murder off humans- he
stopped appalled at the stark picture

  he shook his head good god i
brought all this about why didnt i
die out there on the desert-

  barry helenes cool soothing
voice cut off his half fevered recrim-
inations certainly you cant be
blamed if its anyones fault blame
queen elsha she shuddered ill
never forget her blazing eyes there at
the laboratory with the demon-people
at her back she said rather than kill
me on the spot for stealing your love
from her shed let me be a slave in
phoryx

  val marmax ground his teeth com-
ing out of his apathetic stupor shes
more evil he pronounced than sha-
tahn himself for betraying a whole
world

  and now shes gone back to shor-
raine tyson hissed in one way or
another shell weaken its defenses the
demon-forces will attack with shor-
raine out of the way theyll be free to
conquer earth then with their pup-
pet dictators in power theyll gradually
wipe out the human race and all be-
cause of a woman

arver said nothing what could
one say of a beauteous creature

who dared all for love helen of troy
cleopatra madame dubarry all
faded into insignificance beside her
history repeating itself in the rise and
fall of empires only this time it might
be the final chapter in human history
she had destroyed the most

   but carver couldnt forget her final
glance at him there before the satyrs
nor could he interpret it it had been
a strange mixture of yearning promise
even remorse

  they felt themselves close to mad-
ness in their dark prison it was a
dank stone-walled room lighted dimly
by what seemed to be cold phosphor-
escence in a ceiling globe in its feeble
rays carver could see that there was no
opening save the door-a solid block of
metal he pushed against it futilely
barred outside

  we might as well be at the bottom
of a mountain shrugged tyson hope-
lessly

  hours passed as they waited for
death as soon as the demon-people
had made a successful spot-penetra-
tion they would come to kill them
carver too despite sha-tahns mock-
ing promise to queen elsha carver
laughed hollowly at the thought what
a joke on her

  a sound came from the other side
of the metal door they were here
now to kill them but strangely the
sound was a dull hiss like the bite of
a heat-beam a spot in the metal door
glowed cherry red and finally broke
through lock mechanisms jangled
apart

  carver sprang forward and shoved
at the ponderous door it swung open
and in it was framed-queen elsha
back of her in the corridor lay two
satyrs guards whose gaping wounds
still smoked

   with the opening of the door a rush
of sound had filled the sealed room

sounds from outside and above-dull
boomings and the crackle of unleashed
forces

  battle shouted tyson above
the city-

  yes battle cried the queen of
mu above the bedlam shorraine has
attacked you can escape in the ex-
citement follow me-to my ship

  quickly she handed them each a
beam-pistol carver stared at her a
moment wonderingly then took the
lead a black figure appeared at the
end of the corridor carver fired
though he had tried the pistols before
in practice he was amazed at the pow-
erful charge of infra-heat that blasted
into the satyr charring half his body

  obviously excitement reigned in
phoryx black figures darted down the
corridors not even noticing them
those that did and turned met the
harsh blast of heat from carvers ready
gun

  up these stairs shrilled queen
elsha at the head carver felt the
sinister hum of telekinetic forces past
his ear he rayed a demoniac black
face but another appeared aiming
straight at him with his tubular weapon
a soft hiss from helenes gun at his
side charred the black hand that
threatened carver tysons gun spoke
from the rear as a satyr charged up
from that direction

  they had gained the roof then
three satyrs peering in the sky had
no chance as five beam-guns belched at
once queen elshas ship lay close by
and they ran for it

 ooking up carver wondered how
- they would get free of the ele-
mental furies being hurled about there
a hundred flat-decked ships of shor-
raine widely separated were pouring
down a hell of withering rays whose
touch turned metal to water atomic-
bombs plummeted down blasting
prison of time



buildings and filling the crooked streets
with jagged debris

  up from the city in turn stabbed
equally powerful heat-beams and the
humming invisible telekinetic forces
the surprise of the attack was over
ship after ship blossomed into flame or
ripped apart and dropped like a stone
it was vicious aerial warfare such as
carver had never seen on earth

  hurry screeched queen elsha
she grabbed helenes hand and pulled
hr to the deck carver lifted val mar-
max bodily as the portly scientist stum-
bled

  tyson was already at the controls
as the ship rose three satyrs rushed
from below firing a section of the
deck-rail next to carver splintered and
whirled off carver aiming deliberate-
ly picked off two the third crumpled
as the gun in queen elshas hand spoke

  tyson yelled a warning to hang on
and the ship rocketed up in a wide
weaving arc guns roared below them
how many times a heat-beam or tele-
kinetic blast slashed near them they did
not know but at last they were high
out of range below the few remaining
shorraine ships kept up their grim at-
tack black round ships now arose
from another part of the city to give
chase but tyson grinned in derision as
he set a straight swift course for shor-
raine they had enough of a head start
to be safe

  saved breathed helene phoryx
city of demons dwindled rapidly they
had all crowded together behind the
wind-breaker at the prow

  i guess thats the word agreed
carver looking at queen elsha and
i think we have you to thank elsha

  the queen of mu seemed suddenly
drained of strength she leaned weak-
ly against the bulwark her face pale
and wan behind its rich olive tint
carver put an arm around her shoul-
ders steadying her he could feel her

tremble at the touch

  i have in part-atoned she said
her dark lidded eyes reflected a calm
joy i fooled sha-tahn back there
in his chamber when he offered me an-
other chance i took it but only as a
chance to save you barry and val
marmax

  carver knew now what her final
glance to him had said-trust me
he felt shame inside of him for having
doubted her

  the queen of mu went on back
in shorraine i went immediately to the
five told them the story they
thought it another trick at first but i
convinced them a fleet of a hundred
armed ships shorraines standing force
was sent to the attack but i went
first ahead of them

  my plan worked i landed and
gave sha-tahn the warning that shor-
raine was attacking still playing the
part of his ally he did not think to use
an astral-prober in the excitement
thus as they set about hurriedly u
prepare defenses against the surprise at-
tack they did not watch me when the
battle started i made my way to your
prison-the rest you know

che drew her breath in a half sob

   betraying the strain she had been
under when any false move would have
meant failure and death

  suicide squad murmured carver
thinking of the brave men going to cer-
tain doom he looked searchingly at
the queen and you elsha-regard-
less of what you did before you risked
your life to save ours-

  it wasnt just your lives she cried
a little angrily i was thinking of
earth with val marmax in their
hands the demon-people had the secret
of spot-penetration for themselves
they could invade earth with shor-
raine helpless to interfere that was
the issue at stake burning in my mind


dynamic science stories

- then suddenly her voice changed
oh barry i did it just for you-to

save you 

  she looked up into his face standing
close kiss me barry she de-
manded

  carver stared startled was she still
playing a game serving her own de-
sires hoping to win him by what she
had done confused he glanced at
helene and was more perplexed to see
her nodding slowly almost command-
ingly he had not seen the glances be-
tween the women nor would he a man
have understood the signal exchanged

  he bent to kiss the queen of mu
her lips touched his burningly for a
moment they stood together the man
and woman of ages twelve thousand
years apart then she broke away
our first kiss she murmured and
last

  she moved back carver did not
realize what she was up to till she
stood at the edge of the deck where the
railing was torn out her raven hair
blowing in the head wind she looked
at them all smiling quietly then she
leaned backward

  carver sprang forward with a hoarse
cry but it was too late her white-
robed body tumbled from the ship
turning over and over as it plunged to
the ground three thousand feet below
carver turned away sickened

  a gasp of horror had come from the
others it was the only thing she could
do said val marmax then death
with honor her sentence later for her
original crime of betrayal would have
been death anyway

  tyson grunted she had nerve if
nothing else

  helene was weeping softly bar-
ry she whispered lets think kindly
of her she loved-and lost

  carver nodded slowly his memory
of her would be kind she seemed puri-
fied by her last act for one hour she

had been noble sincere self-sacrificing
so that he could forget what she had
been for twelve thousand years they
were all silent for the rest of the jour-
ney thinking of the queen of ancient
mu

  the slim graceful spires of shorraine
brought a surge of joy to carvers
pulses after the oppressive sojourn in
dark evil phoryx a hum of activity
rose from the great city as it prepared
for the coming struggle with its age-old
enemy on factory roof-tops men
swarmed about rows of ships outfitting
them for wartime pursuits along the
city walls broad lip giant anti-aircraft
guns were being wheeled into position
against the event of attack

  carver went directly to the five
with his party they were in a large
room outfitted with hundreds of flash-
ing television screens directing the citv-
wide preparations but they came for-
ward with eager smiles of greeting

  you have succeeded in bringing
back val marmax said the spokes-
man barry carver you have done
shorraine-and earth-a great serv-
ice

  but only with the help of queen el-
sha carver went on to give the details
briefly

 i he atlantides bowed their heads si-

 	lently for a moment at news of her
death it is not for us to judge her
murmured one he looked up but
now other problems confront us

  yes said carver grimly if the
demon-people have the right spot-pene-
tration data theyll apply it as quickly
as they can earth is menaced how-
soon can we attack in full force

  our facilities have been geared to
full capacity responded the atlantide
turning out guns and mounting them
on all ships available all of shorraine
works on the project with a will one-
third of our forces will be ready tomor-
prison of time



row one-third the next and the next

  then well attack tomorrow de-
clared carver he hesitated who
will lead shorraines forces

  you of course said the atlantide
matter-of-factly we had already de-
cided that if you returned after we had
looked over your plans for a fleet to en-
ter the earth warfare you and tyson
are most versed in aerial battle tyson
will be your second-in-command do
you accept

  the two young men looked at each
other we do tyson tried to say
casually but it was close to a shout

  carver turned to val marmax in
the meantime you will work out the
spot-penetrator units and have the fac-
tories turn them out as we originally
planned despite the coming war
within shorraine carver still thought of
the outside war and the jap army he
hoped yet to stop the earth war was
larger in scope more slow the war in
shorraine promised to be swift and
deadly

  ill have some of the units ready in
a few days and will equip all the ships
within two weeks promised val mar-
max

  one other thing said carver
have a ship sent out to pick up queen
elshas body she ought to be given a
decent burial

  the atlantide nodded it will be
done her people of mu will give her
burial in their ancient ceremonial man-
ner

  the next morning as dawn cast a
crimson glow over the dark lands of
shorr the first fleet of shorraine
hummed into the sky bound on its grim
mission

  the flagship rode at the van of 
ships in rows of ten carver looked
back at the mighty armada concen-
trated destruction was at his command
more than any other leader in history
had ever had he thrilled at the

thought but the enemy was strong
how strong he had yet to find out

  but how queer to think of the men in
back of him-men from all times and
lands united in this venture there
were egyptians who had fought wild
barbarians before europe was civilized
indians and chinese whose dynasties
had once been supreme persians who
had quailed before alexanders con-
quest romans who had stood in their
solid phalanxes knights who had once
jousted and shivered lances merce-
naries who had marched in napoleons
grande amice all alive here by the 
queer timelessness of shorr to fight to-
gether now with the superweapons of
atlantean science

  did he have a unified fighting force
so important in warfare carver was
sure he had he had addressed them
all before the departure they had
cheered lustily regardless of origins
and times the demon-people were a
common enemy satan and all his dark
astral forces had plagued mankind
from the beginning and now when
they might soon ravage out into th
world they must be stopped carver
knew this burning thought was in every
mans breast they would fight as
they had never fought before

etrom what ive heard said ty-

 	son also sweeping his eyes over the
fleet enthusiastically this war to the
finish with phoryx has been building
up for all the twelve thousand years of
shorraines existence it just needed an
event like the spot-penetration to light
the spark barry this is history

  carvers lips tightened as the dark
outline of phoryx climbed the horizon
the enemy did not send out a fleet
though they must know of the attack
through scouts strategy perhaps-
letting the citys defenses protect itself
and saving the fleet for later when
shorraines forces were weakened all

right thought carver it would work
both ways the sooner the city was de-
stroyed the better

   two miles in the air just as the edge
of the sprawling mass carver barked
into his microphone radio carried his
commands to all the ships the fleet
spread out in a long curving formation
ten deep and dived for the city the
anti - aircraft guns below suddenly
awoke flame belched into the sky
one ships prow sagged and then the
metal burned like paper another ship
split in half as the ravening telekinetic
force blew a hole through it

  the battle was on

   carvers fleet at his orders blasted
out with their heat-beams at the bottom
of a sweeping trajectory raking over
the nearest line of towers the hellish
force of atomic-energy toppled three of
them molten metal dripped to the
streets the last line of ships bombers
dropped their deadly loads with ter-
rific roars that seemed to shake the
whole universe the atomic-bombs con-
verted their targets to twisted smoking
ruins titanic destruction

  yet at the top of their swooping
climb when the fleet reorganized its
formation carver looked below and
saw that the damage was tiny compared
to the citys extent and he had lost six
ships it would be a long costly
job   

  the fleet of shorraine dived again-
and again hours passed while holo-
caustic energies were hurled between
the belligerents at times tired of just
watching carver took the place of one
of his ships gunners he took satisfac-
tion in running a heat-beam down the
face of a building and splitting it open
like a pod now and then he saw tiny
satyr figures running about madly
though most of the buildings had prob-
ably been evacuated

  when night fell carver called a
halt he looked below a charred

wedge had been added to the darksome
city but how much remained to be
done and he had lost  ships

  they wont surrender of course
tyson said well just have to batter
the whole city down-if we last
yes im wondering myself carver
muttered but its all we can do this
is a war of extermination

  on the second and third days barry
carver led out successively greater
fleets he smashed at phoryx from five
different points working inward the
black cancer of their annihilation crept
steadily forward

  they havent sent one ship up
against us carver mused thoughtfully
at the end of the third day that
means they are confident of spot-pene-
tration and dont care about the city
they are saving their ships for-earth
i dont think we can destroy the city
fast enough to stop them weve got to
get control of their spot

  and thats just where theyll have
their main forces concentrated tyson
returned dubiously

  well have to try carver ground
out

iie sought out val marmax the

  	scientist with a staff of helpers
was busily adjusting a battery of robot
machinery

  how soon will you have the first
units ready carver demanded

  in two days

  no sooner grunted carver w
must gain control of their spot on bti
sides when our first ships go out we
can send them to the earth-side of their
spot-bottle them up in the mean-
time well try blocking them on this
side

  the attack the next day concen-
trated at phoryxs city-gates ran into
full resistance from the enemy true to
tysons prediction anti-aircraft guns
sent up a terrific barrage that downed
prison of time



shorraines ships like falling leaves
and for the first time the demon-peo-
ples black circular ships rose to battle

  obviously the enemy was deter-
mined to hold its spot just as deter-
minedly carver hurled his forces at
them relentlessly hoping to smash
through he didnt

  and late in the day when the aerial
battle had been carried high he saw a
line of ships sail low and straight for
the spot

  theyre going through gasped

tyson

  the first ship had faded suddenly
entering the area of the spot enclosed
by the great gates it became a dim
shadow and then winked out entirely as
though it had been swallowed up in thin
air one after another the rest fol-
lowed carver counted more than a
hundred

  tyson looked around soberly they
beat us to it barry they had a days
start on val marmax since he had to
start all over devising the unit on pa-
per when he got back to shorraine
they have the same robot machinery
they beat us to it

  carver groaned and tomorrow-

  when they sent out their first test
ship through the spot the next day it
came back hurriedly with half its prow
shattered the enemy waited out there

  they have us bottled up muttered
tyson we can send out only one
ship at a time suicide

  the battle has to be finished here
in shorr val marmax stated sol-
emnly he went on croakingly and
they will outlast us they are stronger
numerically they can draw recruits
from outlying settlements of theirs we
of shorraine-are limited

  gloom settled over them at this in-
escapable fact carvers mind strove
for a way out it was the old axiom of
warfare in a dragged out struggle-

manpower was the deciding factor
lacking that what could shorraine do
to swing the tide they had already
lost two thousand ships and twenty
thousand men in another week their
drained manpower would leave shor-
raine easy prey to attack the shadow
of doom lay over them like a blight

  carver turned to tyson and suddenly
asked a queer question have you
still got your old flying togs

  yes tyson said surprised i put
them away carefully when i came to
shorraine sentimental i guess why

voure going to wear them
 stated carver eyes narrowed
and i am going to wear mine to-
night a ship is going to secretly land
us outside phoryxs gates tomorrow
morning well enter phoryx-as wan-
derers from earth

  i see gasped tyson at the daring
plan but what can we do-

  wtiat any other spy or sabotage
agent does in the enemys camp said
carver grimly work for their down-
fall he whirled on val marmax
that apparatus with the speaking
tubes that we saw-do you think it
might control all the enslaved eartli-
people in phoryx

  it likely does cried the scientist
a flash of understanding in his eyes
it would correspond to a telepathic
central switchboard there are about
 human souls in phoryx under
that domination if they were freed-
barryivielene threw her arms
around carvers neck you cant go
back there i cant let you i cant
she clung to him tightly

  carver spoke gently this may
hurt dear but suppose your father were
one of them he was lost in the desert
too i have a chance to free these peo-
ple and help shorraine at the same time
dont you see

  the girl fell back her face wild


dynamic science stories

then she gripped herself and nodded
go barry she breathed

  shivering in the cold night breeze
carver and tyson watched as a crimson
dawn splashed over the wild terrain of
shorr they crouched beneath phoryxs
great gates where they had been landed
an hour previously by a silent dark
ship in their earthly uniforms of air-
men they looked the part of men who
had just wandered into the spot from
the sahara desert their faces had
been disguised by skilled touches of
cosmetics

  well have to wait at least two
hours whispered carver were
supposed to have seen phoryx as a
mirage and mirages dont appear too
early in the morning

  tyson nodded his teeth chattering
though not from fright both of them
were calm it was a desperate game
they were playing but it offered one
chance of bursting the prison bars of
doom around themselves and all shor-
raine

  they heard the busy hum of the city
this evil powerful city which would
soon be master of two worlds if fate so
willed along the curve of the wall
they could see pacing sentries black
satyrs whose hooves clattered loudly on
stone at times they saw scurrying hu-
man figures carrying burdens doing the
bidding of their cruel masters carver
dug his nails into his own palm such
would be the lot of all humans if the
demon-people won

  high overhead a black ship circled
watching for attack from shorraine it
would come soon carver had arranged
for the attack at about that time the
subsequent excitement in phoryx would
increase the two mens chances of ac-
complishing something without being
too closely watched

   but before shorraines forces arrived
the huge gates suddenly swung wide

carver could peer in at an angle a
line of ships darted from the large build-
ing which was sha-tahns central head-
quarters carver gasped standing
stiffly at the deck of the first ship was
that familiar figure with the lick of
black hair over his forehead and the
small mustache beside him stood the
short squat yellow man cheek scarred
lips cruel hitler and genghis kahn
two of historys most ruthless conquer-
ers and under the domination of a yet
more evil nature-sha-tahn

 i he ship winked out before their
eyes as it entered the area of the
spot it continued as a ghostly shadow
on into the earth dimension one by
one the others followed

  another hundred hissed tyson
and evidently these are being sent out
into the world already sha-tahn is
confident of victory here in shorr
lets go said carver

  they straightened up hugged the
wall till they came to the spot area
and then boldly walked through it into
phoryx they simulated attitudes of
astonishment and fearful wonder twist-
ing their heads around

  a satyr came running up you are
from the sahara desert he asked in
perfect english

  carver and tyson nodded word-
lessly as though too astounded to
speak they tried to show as much of
stark fear as they could putting them-
selves in the place of men who saw all
this for the first time

  you are in phoryx city of shorr
which is another world explained the
satyr briefly you cannot escape you
will not lie harmed if you do as we say
come with me

  the two earthmen stepped forward
as though too mentally numbed to re-
monstrate the satyr walked at their
side watchfully with a hand on the
butt of his gun it was evidently the
prison of time



usual method of introducing newcom-
ers to phoryx terse and abrupt with-
out giving them time to think or object
carver was grimly satisfied to note that
they were heading for the great tow-
ered building just opposite the gate
which he knew from the last time to be
sha-tahns headquarters

  the satyr motioned toward a door
and herded them down the dim-lit cor-
ridors what were they being led to
carver tried to orient himself in the
building vaguely he knew that the
telepathy-control room was off the
ground level and toward the rear some-
how or other they must get there

  finally they were taken into a large
room against one wall stood a large
apparatus of indefinable purpose two
other satyrs looked up spoke a few
words with their captor and then
turned to the machine moving levers
brought it to humming life the first
satyr motioned to a flat wide bench that
lay under a frosty globe

  one of you will lie down there he
commanded

  what do you mean to do asked
carver in false terror playing his part
at the same time he did want to know
what the machine was for what is
this all about what- he stopped
swallowing

  the satyr leered evilly obviously
taking their bewildered discomfiture as
real and enjoying it

  you will be in phoryx a long time
he promised licking his lips as though
he relished telling this but as
slaves you cannot escape it be
warned that this gun i have-he drew
it-can blast you to instant death if
you resist under the machine an
astral-force will penetrate your brain
and lodge in the cortex center of will
suppressing it after that you will
obey all commands by word or tel-
epathy without the slightest power to
resist now you the big one get on

that bench or if you choose to die
attack me we are not so much in need
of slaves anymore as soon we will have
all earth to pick from well

  carver glanced at tyson once un-
der the apparatus they were lost they
would be mindless bereft of will flesh
and blood robots but on the other
hand they were menaced by a gun
whose telekinetic forces they knew
only too well as a blasting death

  carver tensed it was do or die the
satyr brought up his gun sharply

cuddenly a loud bell clanged in
 the corridor and echoed from sev-
eral other directions carver knew it
must be the general alarm that shor-
raines forces were attacking at the
sound of the bell the satyrs had invol-
untarily looked around and at that
moment the two earthmen leaped

  carver caught the satyr with the gun
in a flying tackle that knocked him off
his feet and sent his weapon clattering
against the wall the satyr struggled
wildly kicking with his hard hooves
and curling his prehensile tail around
carvers waist carver wasted as little
time as possible he grasped the crea-
tures neck and banged his head against
the floor with all the force of his earthly
muscles the satyr went limp his skull
crushed

  carver sprang np whirling tyson
cursing was battering away with his
fists at one satyr the other was leap-
ing for the door carver grabbed up
the weapon in the corner and stabbed at
the side button the gun gave a little
kick the satyr with a choked scream
went down the telekinetic charge
had torn his throat out tysen
knocked his adversary with a final up-
percut

  carver stepped to the door and
looked cautiously down the hall al-
though several satyrs passed in various
cross passages none seemed to notice


dynamic science stories

what had occurred in the room

  the attack came just in time for
us panted tyson

  nows our chance in all this hub-
bub said carver rapidly if we can
find that telepathy room lets go we
can walk along the halls as though we
were human slaves of theirs on some
errand he stuck the gun in his belt

  it seemed hours that they wandered
through the huge building though they
knew it was only minutes minutes
that were tense nerve-wracking at
any moment they might be challenged
apprehended but luckily because of
the bustle of the attack the satyrs who
passed barely glanced at them the
two earthmen shuffled along with heads
half bowed like the mind-slaves of pho-
ryx

  they ascended steps and worked
their way upward somewhere up here
must be their destination tyson
grunted suddenly this looks famil-
iar yes this is the hall leading to sha-
tahns chamber the next cross cor-
ridor must lead to where we were
trapped last time-

  youre right carver headed
down the hall knowing the way now

  soon they came within sight of the
central room with its many branching
corridors from here evidently
groups of human slaves were assigned
to various duties guided by telepathic
commands standing against the wall
carver could see five satyrs in the room
giving their commands into the row of
horns

  five-and all armed said carver
grimly moving forward with his gun in
hand

  wait hissed tyson satyr com-
ing down the hall

  he hurried up glancing at them but
without suspicion as he went by car-
ver deliberately aimed his weapon the
humming charge cracked the side of his
head open almost before the body had

fallen carver jerked his gun from its
holster and handed it to tyson

  then tight-lipped they crept to the
central room

  one of the satyrs turning looked
them full in the face as they reached
the doorway he shouted hoarsely
pulling out his gun he fell his chest
torn as carvers gun spat viciously
the other four whirled jerking at their
weapons two more went down as the
earthmen fired together carver
ducked as a gun swung at him but felt
his left arm go limp as the charge ripped
into his shoulder his return shot was
more accurate and the one remaining
satyr died with a strangled gasp as ty-
son fired

 i hey had done it carver told

 	himself that with a surge of tri-
umph now if only the rest would
work out as he hoped and wanted his
lips twisted with the pain of his shat-
tered shoulder but that could wait

  quick he barked to tyson close
the doors lock them if you can then
keep watch keep them out for the
next five minutes come heaven or hell
while i-

  he stepped before the wall appara-
tus looking it over with keen search-
ing eyes under each horn was a series
of studs some pressed down that
must be the on position rapidly he
went down the rowr shoving all the
studs down a deep rising hum came
from behind the panel telepathic
forces of some sort broadcast through
all the city attuned in some intricate
way to the will-less minds of phoryxs
human slaves wild conjecture no
he must be right-he must

  carver stepped back drawing a
breath then he yelled out

  slaves attention you are free
arise against your hated masters
wherever you are whatever you are
doing arise-and kill your masters
prison of time



  carver stopped tom he said fer-
vently in lower tones if you ever
prayed before pray now that this
works 

  carver repeated the message was
his voice translated to telepathic im-
pulses by the machine impinging in ev-
ery human slave-brain in phoryx were
they straightened up released from
a previous command-free and seeth-
ing with vengeance some of the peo-
ple must have been here thousands of
years how strong must be their ha-
tred against the satyrs

  carver forced himself to think more
rationally how much could they do
before the satyrs finally destroyed them
all if just enough pandemonium and
chaos could be created to let the attack-
ing forces of shorraine get a foothold
a vantage-

  carver barked out again stentorian-
ly

  slaves of phoryx arise and kill
your masters take all weapons you
can those of you near anti-aircraft
guns take them over do not shoot the
ships of shorraine blast those of pho-
rox those of you near the spot area
converge on the defenses at that point
take over all guns and positions you
can shoot down the ships of phorox
fight slaves fight-for freedom and
for earth

  here they come cried tyson the
doors which he had closed and locked
by a bolt mechanism rang with repetted
blows blasts of telekinetic force
ripped out gaping holes

  carver aimed his gun at the tele-
pathy-machines panel and swept its
charge down the line wasting out the
studs one by one his last command
to the mind-slaves would be the last
they would hear for a time to come
back of the panel the throbbing ceased
as connections broke

  then carver turned waiting calmly
for the demon-people to blast their way

  in there was no chance of escape this
time he only wished he could know
before he went whether success had re-
warded his efforts

  suddenly a wall screen spangled into
a television view sha-tahns dark evil
face peered out at the two besieged
earthmen he leered satanically as
earth mythology represented his astral
alter ego

  as i thought he spoke peering
sharply barry carver despite the
disguise you will die for what you
have done-horribly not by gun no
he gave a command at the side then
turned back no you shall suffer
slowly for weeks perhaps months a
little astral being will perch in your
brain and keep screaming screaming
till you go mad but then it will keep
on

 i he noises outside the door ceased

  and down from the ceiling darted
a black shadow carver knew there
was no use running the shadow en-
veloped his head probed with its psy-
chic forces and a faint scream sound-
ed within carvers brain it kept on
steadily carver knew it would drive
him mad but before them he would-

  he gasped he tried to raise his gun
to his own temple but some force pre-
vented him he could not will his own
death

  you see snarled sha-tahn you
will suffer and-

  at that moment shouts sounded
strange wild shouts that seemed to
come from all directions human
shouts sha-tahns face vanished from
the screen with a startled look upon it
at the same time the astral tormenter
over carvers head disappeared

  tyson had sprung to the door look-
ing out of a gaping rent

the slaves he shouted joyfully
theyre out in the hall fighting the

satyrs barry it worked-

  carver leaped for the door opened
it the satyrs were backed against the
wall shooting it out with a party of men
swarming down the corridor it was
over in a moment and with blood-
curdling screams of triumph the earth-
people surged toward sha-tahns room

  lets get in on that cried carver
he was only partially aware of the
blood dripping down his sleeve from
his torn shoulder he and tyson were
with the party when it swarmed into
sha-tahns presence a withering bar-
rage of gun-fire met them but the rest
crowded forward eagerly madly
screaming revenge carver realized
that very few of them were sane he
had loosed a pack of demented mon-
sters among the demon-people who
had made them so somehow it was
divine justice

  sha-tahns party retreated then
piercing cries from the back of them
and they were trapped between two
fires in desperation they made a
break for it past carvers party some-
how sha-tahn was there across sights
he pressed and watched the ruler of
phoryx fall a corpse

  carver was in a daze his shoidder
pained agonizingly was it possible
that he had just killed the monster who
for thousands of years had worked his
way into earth history as-satan
was this all a mad dream he was so
confused and so weak it couldnt be
true it was all a terrible impossible
dream and then a tidal wave of dark-
ness swept him off his feet   

darry carver stood at the prow
of the sleek ship as it rose grace-
fully over shorraine he had one arm
around helene the other was in a
sling his shoulder wound had nearly
healed

  they had told him later of the full
destruction of phoryx after his delir-

  ium and fever were gone how the up-
rising earth slaves obeying his tele-
pathic commands to the letter had de-
moralized phoryxs fighting forces
they had stormed every position
wrested away guns shot down the
demon-peoples ships shorraines aer-
ial forces had been able to land within
the city and take over more guns be-
fore the end of that day theenemy was
isolated in various sections besieged
most of their great fleet was destroyed

  in three more days the city had been
practically leveled those of the satyrs
still alive had raced to the dark lands
their power was broken

arvers ship piloted by tom

at its nose a magnetic machine
thrummed powerfully they felt a

a soft yellow glare it brightened to

breath

  he looked back one after one

stretch out like a string of beads over
the hot desert five thousands ships

years tuition and that coach lou little
had told me for three autumns straight
that i was the most exasperating var-
sity tackle hed ever failed to teach
football rudiments and that id have
to wear a cap and gown in tomorrows
heat and that i was only sam sterrett
of the truck-driving sterretts and that
marjories dad-j barton cannon of
the wall street cannons-had prom-
ised to skin me alive if i didnt leave
his daughter alone i almost forgot my
invention the one thing i had to show
for four years of hard grubbing at elec-
tro-physics

dut i couldnt forget that because
it lay on the dressing table in my
little room in john jay hall or rather
they lay because there were two of
them two little bits of clear glass
about the shape and size of acorn cups
not perfect i knew but a step in a new
direction

  the idea-id better explain in the
beginning-came to me in high school
i saw how glass could modify and mix
light a prism broke it up into the spec-
trum a lens focussed it to a point of
heat a mirror flashed it back at an an-
gle a flaw distorted it and so on that
year for the first time id read under-
standing about x-rays i began to
dream then to plan something that
would do away with all the mechanical
fuss and cumber-a simple glass modi-
fier that would absorb instead of giv-
ing off the rays would be a lens instead
of a reflector would in short achieve
the transparency without use of power
artificial light or a shopful of accesso-
ries

  and now after four years at the uni-
versity i had this to show this pair
of crystal shells that came to the prob-
lems fringe but no closer

  i picked up one i had made it like
those little spectacle-things that fit right
over the eyeball though almost as

thin as paper it contained five distinct
layers between two of these was a tiny
vacuum chamber with microscopic x-
ray devices-cathode anode and anti-
cathode-but made i say to absorb
and not to produce no induction coil
but certain metals that fused properly
in the glass supplied power enough   
never mind which metals thats my se-
cret  i dipped the shell into a cru-
cible of boric acid solution then spread
apart the lids of my right eye and let it
snick into place there colorless snug
it would be almost completely unnotice-
able then i dipped the other shell and
fitted it to my left eye

  this was my first try of the complete
lenses and though my early experi-
ments had prepared me pretty well i
gloomed all over again when i looked
at my fingers they were just fingers-
healthy meaty freckled-not a shad-
owy rind with bones showing through
as in a real x-ray the device was only
half effective couldnt see through liv-
ing organic tissue only thin layers of
inanimate non-minerals

  gazing at a cardboard box on the
dresser i felt a little better through
the lid i could make out my shirt studs
my cuff links and the medal  won for
winning the discus throw i had
achieved the beginnings of success
maybe enough to build on for perfec-
tion meanwhile id better hustle over
to riverside drive this was the after-
noon that marjorie had promised to slip
away from her swagger college upstate
and see me that college was run like
a girls reformatory but in the last
month wed been able to meet twice
through the help of miss wheatland
a new substitute instructor shed
helped marjorie to slip away i thanked
heaven that one teacher at least had
a heart so i left john jay still wear-
ing my lenses i planned to amuse the
ladies by counting the coins in their
purses and so on
insight



  heading for grants tomb where
marjorie would be waiting i treed to
figure some profit out of the gadgets
my best chance would be a sort of
mind-reading stunt in a theater and id
never dare try-im not the mental type
as far as looks go and im prone to get
stage fright anyway all wrapped up
in thoughts like that i took no notice
of anybody or anything i was almost
run over by cars buses people at last
i reached the tomb and marjorie
came around the corner of it toward
me

  of course i always look at marjorie
so i looked hard and i was within an
inch of fainting

  there she stood smiling my dream
girl the one i yearned to marry with-
out a stitch on every curve of her
every pink inch from her fluffy blonde
pate to her manicured toes was revealed
to me and she was saying calmly
and cheerfully hello sam youre on
time to the dot why whats the mat-
ter i declare youre blushing

a bout that time my poor simple

  	one-track brain had the answer
the eye-pieces of course theyd x-
rayed marjories clothes i hadnt
thought of that simply because i never
think of more thanone thing at a time
embarrassed the words not one-
tenth strong enough i managed to
mumble i was thinking dear how
beautiful you are

  how do you like my new dress
she demanded and when i said i
guessed it was okay-it was only slight-
ly visible like a wisp of smoke-she
laughed like a peal of bells you dont
sound very convincing sam darling if
i hadnt mentioned it you wouldnt
even have noticed my dress at all

  by then my face was so red that i
doubt if my freckles showed i wanted
desperately to get those infernal things
out of my eyes but i didnt dare not

with marjorie looking on shed want
to know what they were and id have
to tell her then-gee maybe shed
never speak to me again that was too
awful to imagine

  but she didnt know and she was
saying miss wheatland helped me
slip away as usual im expecting her
to come along any moment-oh here
she is now you remember miss wheat-
land of course

  id met marjories teacher friend
twice already how do you do i
began to say turning to greet her and
gazing into that stern spectacled face
that so belied a heart made apparently
of pure gold

  and then i saw the rest of miss
wheatland without benefit of the prim
dress she usually wore and i was worse
shocked still

  for that maiden-lady face i knew
was set upon the body of a man-
brawny shoulders hairy chest a blotch
of tattoo on one corded arm-and on
the left side under the muscle-ridged
armpit lurked something to scare even
a football lummox with half-baked sci-
entific ambitions

  she-or he-was carrying a huge
automatic pistol blue and shiny and
lethal looking i hadnt expected to
diagnose anything like that with my
x-ray

  how do you do mr sterrett said
the voice that i recognized as miss
wheatlands i hope that i find you
well young man im going to take you
and marjorie to tea

  to tea i repeated foolishly as
though id never dreamed of such a
thing i was trying to add everything
up miss wheatland was in reality a
man disguised as a woman teacher-
that meant mystery he was carrying
a gun a whacking big one-that meant
outlawry violence crime he was deep-
ly interested in marjorie pretending to

be her best friend-golly that meant
desperate danger to the girl i loved   

   yes to tea replied the casual voice
of the wheatland impersonator a
friend of mine has given me the key
to her apartment quite near here on
riverside drive come along its a
lovely place-so restful-

  lets be going chimed in marjorie
and burrowed her little hand in under
my elbow

  wait a moment i began to say
then changed my mind all right
ladies lets go and have tea by all
means

  because i realized that i couldnt
back out this wheatland creature was
after marjorie for something my x-
ray lenses could penetrate his disguise
but not his plan i had to tag along
protect marjorie foil the whole thing

  how

  we walked for several blocks and i
studied desperately every step of the
way i only half noticed that the grass
was green or the sky blue or that mar-
jorie was chattering happily or that the
wheatland faker was pretending to be
pleasantly philosophical or that all the
crowds of people along the drive looked
to my lenses like a nudist parade i was
full of the knowledge that i had to do
something about this mess and do it
mighty quick

 i here was a cop on one corner-
a fine big irishman with a faint
tinge of blue to the cloudy film that
was his uniform and a badge and night-
stick quite plain to view i almost
yelled to him but did not what would
i be saying that this quiet-looking
old maid was really a gunman and that
i knew because  could see through his
clothes that would settle everything
but then marjorie would know about
the x-ray glasses and goodbye ro-
mance

  we reached the apartment building

went in and then up in an automatic
elevator marjorie standing close to
me and all unaware that she looked to
me like a very unadorned greek stat-
ue said do you feel all right sam
your eyes look glassy i smiled and
shook my humming head but i guess
my eyes would have looked glassy even
without those lenses no they wouldnt
because without the lenses id never
have known-oh skip it im a rotten
story teller

  we rode up to the top floor and the
wheatland bandit conducted us down
a hall and into a swank apartment the
foyer alone was as big as my room at
john jay marjorie bounced on
through and sank down on a divan in
the parlor but i paused on the inner
threshold for at the far end of that
drawing room in a shadowy little nook
crouched a squat burly man

  he was the greatest shock id had
yet

  he was nude to my x-ray eyes of
course but that was no longer a nov-
elty he held a gun ready in his hand
but i had already spied and dared the
gun under the armpit of that wheat-
land hoodlum it was his face that
made me shiver and turn cold i knnv
that face as anyone must know it who
ever picked up a photo paper bald
head heavy black brows short upper
lip lantern jaw-it was dillard harpe

  right the one and only dillard
harpe for whom j edgar hoover and
his g-men were ransacking the coun-
try dillard harpe jailbreaker killer
kidnapper-there i had it the whole
thing made sense on the instant harpe
and this wtieatland yegg were out to
kidnap marjorie and hold her for ran-
som    maybe kill her   

  whats the matter it was the
mock-prim wheatland voice in my ear
is there anything wrong young man

 why-why-

  oh youre admiring the hanging
insight



yonder yes its a beautiful piece of
oriental silk print isnt it

  that was the first realization i had
that the nook was hidden by a curtain
of some sort and that dillard harpe
was ambushed behind it or that he
would be ambushed if i hadnt come
equipped with those x-ray peepers so
i gulped and managed to agree that
the hanging was a perfect triumph of
design the wheatland phoney didnt
tumble but he did put a chair for me
in the corner farthest from dillard
harpes hiding place

  then he touched a button on a desk
and a bell rang in from the kitchen
came an oriental servant with a tea-
cart he was the ugliest mongol i had
ever seen outside of a war-scare car-
toon and the muscles of his body re-
vealed to my cloth-penetrating vision
looked tough and wiry and jiujitsuv
he wasnt carrying a gun only a long
wavy-edged knife stuck under a belt
of which i could make out only the iron
buckle so there were three in the kid-
nap gang all armed and i began to
know a new all-time high of being
scared three gangsters with guns and
knives can put plenty of chill into one
science student with x-ray lenses

  the teacups were visible all right
and i could handle mine but the sand-
wiches being organic and lifeless
looked like a heap of thin fleecy cloud
on the plate i had to refuse with
thanks wheatland-at last i was think-
ing of him as a man not an old witch
who had magically changed sex-was
keeping up a conversation of fashions
and bridge-playing and such woman-
topics and marjorie tucked up at one
end of her divan was laughing and
chiming in i didnt say much and
what i did say must have sounded
hoarse and absent-minded

out yourself in my place-sitting in
the corner of a strange swanky

apartment balancing a teacup on my
knee slantwise across the room my
girl perching unconcernedly and hap-
pily with nothing on but a shadow of
gray two men with guns watching
like hawks and fu manchus homely
brother lurking in the kitchen with a
skinning-knife about two feet long it
was the sort of situation that rises in a
movie serial just when the screen
flashes out the words end of episode
 how will captain jack tunible-
water outuit the pirate horde and
rescue lady clarissa from a fate
worse than death retjirn to this
theater next week jor episode g oj
hoboken hamstringers the
big difference was that i couldnt wait
a week for the showdown something
was due to break loose any second and
id be in the thick of it

   wheatland finished his tea and
turned to the desk he picked up a pen
and looked across at me will you do
a favor for us    it was still the
voice of the old-maid school teacher
austere but loveable who was bring-
ing two young sweethearts together
and who was entitled to ask favors i
had to say why of course miss
wheatland and marjorie beamed at
me for being a nice polite boy

   im going to write a little note
went on the wolf in teachers clothing
i was just wondering if i could impose
on you to take it out and mail it a
grin at both of us meant to look kindly
as a matter of fact marjorie my
dear this is to your father it is to as-
sure him that i am taking splendid care
of you

   i see nodded marjorie thank
you so much miss wheatland

   i see was my echo and i did see
this was to be the ransom note and
wheatland was telling about it going to
marjories father to explain the name
j barton cannon on the envelope my
mind went x-ray too for a moment


dynamic science stories

and i seemed to have a vision of what
the letter would read like-something
on this order

  mr cannon

    we are holding your daughter
  prisoner dont try to find her or
  tell the police if you want to see
  her alive again draw 
  from the bank in old bills and
  wait for word from our repre-
  sentative

  i let my eyes wander toward the
nook where dillard harpe americas
public enemy number i-a thought he
was hidden from view he was all re-
laxed now standing up straight with
his arms folded on his chest and the
gun dangling by its trigger-guard from
one forefinger i suppose my size had
given him a little start at first but by
now he had me pegged down for a dumb
college jasper who instead of being
dangerous was about to oblige by run-
ning an errand

  wheatland had apparently finished
the note and was folding it he did
something else with a sliding motion-
that would be to put the letter into an
envelope then he lifted his hands to
his mouth licking the flap i couldnt
see and stuck it down he opened a
drawer of the desk and fumbled in it

  heres a stamp he announced
now mr sterrett will you please
mail this theres a post-box just out-
side this building on the corner

  of course i will miss wheatland
i said getting up and coming to the
desk wheres the letter

  why here it is right before your
eyes and i was able to perceive in
his outstretched hand a pale oblong
blur that must be the envelope whats
come over you young man some-
thing troubling your mind

por the first time there was a deadly

	note in that voice so carefully
pitched in old-maid timbre wheat-

land was suspecting me at last it was
marjorie who saved me for the mo-
ment

  oh you must forgive sam she
laughed from the divan hes a sci-
ence student you know and very seri-
ous probably hes turning over some
new scientific formula-problem in his
mind

  yes yes i made haste to agree
thats it a new formula

  indeed wheatland still sounded
as if he was on the point of reaching for
his hidden gun and what may i ask
is this new formula

  oh a-a new type of magnetic at-
traction i replied on inspiration i
was reminded by-this

  i put out my hand and picked up
from the top of the desk a round
gleaming paperweight the size of a ten-
nis ball

  that cant be magnetized de-
murred wheatland at once its made
of brass

  he knew the rudiments of science
did that disguised torpedo but he
didnt know the inspiration that had
come and was now growing in my
brain already i was six jumps ahead
of that obvious objection

  this is quite new and startling
miss wheatland  babbled as plausi-
bly as i could manage weve been
experimenting in secret at the univer-
sity brass can be magnetized to an

our new power which involves the

of like substance to each other even at
considerable distance by now i had
spied in front of the arty-looking fire-
place two big brazen andirons let
me show you ladies one of our experi-
ments

  wheatlands suspicions were allayed
by now but he didnt want to see any
insight



marvels of science he wanted me to
crry that letter to the post-box and
leave him and his fellowrats alone with
marjorie later perhaps he put me
off wait until youve mailed this-
but it will take only a few seconds
i pleaded and marjorie leaned for-
ward to add yes i want to see what
hes going to do

  all right all right agreed wheat-
land not very graciously go ahead
and show us how does it work
first of all i said imitating the
lecture-manner of my stuffiest profes-
sor i shall shut off the magnetic influ-
ences from this paperweight i fished
out my handkerchief and knotted the
brass lump inside then laid it on the
desk once more next miss wheat-
land i shall ask you to help me

 help you how

  i want you to hold this turning
to the fireplace i picked up one of the
andirons it was wrought all over with
cute modern designs but it was big and
heavy lets have you sit where i was
that will give us the length of the room
to show off the experiment in

  this is exciting squealed mar-
jorie wheatland took the andiron i
forced on him and went and sat in my
chair in the far corner

  what next he prompted me
hold your hands at opposite ends
of the andiron i directed very im-
pressively yes like that now knead
the two ends in your palms hard
thats it keep doing it

  whats this for he wanted to
know

  we dont quite understand as yet
 replied glibly i said that this is a
very recent type of experiment and the
power is rather mysterious some of
the professors think its the human life-
fovce which in some ways seems
closely related to electricity communi-
cating itself to the brass others say
that there is a sort of sub-atomic affin-

ity between flesh and an alloy of cop-
per and zinc-

  young man interrupted wheat-
land icily as he rubbed at the chunk of
metal i begin to suspect that you arc
having a rather feeble joke at my ex-
pense let me warn you that i am a
woman who is not used to being joked
with

  oh but i wouldnt dream of joking
with you i made haste to say were
ready to start now keep kneading the
ends of the andiron faster miss
wheatland now-

i picked up the paperweight in the

	handkerchief and walked to where
in the curtained nook stood dillard
harpe concealed from every eye but
mine he had come forward against his
hanging as if to peep through a hole
and see what i was up to  turned
around with my back to him and faced
the room harpe was so close to me
that he could have reached out and
grabbed me

  now i repeated i shall demon-
strate this new magnetic force i shall
release this bit of brass from its wrap-
pings and you ladies will see it float
like a bubble clear across the room it
wont stop until it touches that andiron
in miss wheatlands lap are you both
ready

  ready grumbled wheatland and
ready cried marjorie i smiled as
disarmingly as i could and held out
the weight in the handkerchief so that
it dangled at arms length in fvont of
me

  then i spun around as hard and
quick as  could the brass weight
swung like a blackjack it struck the
hanging and rang like a bell-clapper on
the skull just behind harpe gave a sort
of moan and began to collapse

  but  didnt wait to see him finish
the fall  let the spin carry me clear
around facing the room again mai

jorie was shrinking back on the settee
her mouth open as if she was trying to
scream wheatland was half out of the
chair throwing the heavy andiron from
his lap

  i dropped the handkerchief and pa-
perweight and made two striding
leaps at the end of the second i had
my head well down and my arms out
i left the ground in a flying diving
tackle

  if coach lou little had been there
hed have been critical its illegal-in
football-to tackle with both feet off
the ground but it worked beautifully

  my right shoulder smacked just
above wheatlands knees and back he
tumbled into the chair the chair
went over so hard did we hit it and
broke into a dozen pieces of kindling
wheatland struck the floor beyond
with the flat of his shoulders and for a
moment i was standing almost on my
head above him then i twisted out of
what might have been a somersault
and dropped on his belly i remember
wishing that my two hundred pounds
was two thousand

  it was working out as i hadnt dare
hope hed had to scoop that andiron
out of his lap before drawing his gun
and so id won the moment of time i
needed wheatland was groggy but
game thrashing around and digging for
the pistol but i kept on top and
clutched his right forearm his left fist
smashed up at my face and i felt my
ees blur as my head snapped back
and thse x-ray lenses flew free to land
on the carpet beside us but i hung
onto his gun arm even when he hit me
a second and third time with my left
hand i tore open his blouse-now that
the lenses were gone i could see his
clothing very prim and old-maidish-
and grabbed the gun myself

   rose to my knees wheatland tried
to grapple but i brought down the
gun-barrel across his temple he melted

down like a snow man in a heavy thaw
there was a mouthful of oriental ex-
pletives from the kitchen and the serv-
ant rushed from there his knife whip-
ping out from beneath his white coat
i pointed the captured pistol

  drop that toad-sticker i yelled
quick and it tinkled on the floor
get your hands up and stand with
your face in that corner

  he did as i told him now i could
spare a glance for his two pals dillard
harpe was lying motionless half out
of sight his head and shoulders were
twisted up in the hanging hed pulled
down and his gun had bounced well
out of his reach wheatland lay crum-
pled at my feet breathing heavily and
fluttering his eyelids

that new dress of hers about 
worth of beautifully cut gray silk
sam she was quavering whats
happening

  its all happened i reassured her
these three merry men thought they
were going to carry you off to their lair
-look out i warned as she came
closer dont step on those things
theyre valuable

  i bent quickly and snatched up the
two curved pieces of glass from in front
of her approaching slippers thank
heaven they arent broken i mum-
bled to myself not even chipped
marjorie was staring what are
they sam

  nothing i made haste to reply
nothing at all marjorie-just a-a
pair of good luck pieces now be a
good girl and telephone the police while
i hold this gun on our friends

  ninety minutes later i was sitting in
the office of the new york chfef of
detcctives i was smoking a big cigar
that i didnt particularly want but j

burton cannon had given it to me
hed also said what id never hoped
to hear-that he would be proud to
have me as a son-in-law and he hoped
marjorie and i would have at least
eight sons just like me and that i must
be one of the brigade of vice-presidents
at his bank

  the chief leaned across the desk
toward me he had to speak loudly
for in the end of the room a g-man
was telephoning to washington trying
to convince somebody he called boss
that the dillard harpe gang had just
been captured by a lone college boy

  there was a ten thousand dollar
reward out for harpe said the chief
of detectives and five thousand each
for wheatland and that yellow boy
with the knife considerable potatoes
mr sterrett and i hear that you can
take a banking job if you want it

  i dont intend to i assured him
i hoped youd say that he crowed
and grabbed my hand look here mr
sterrett we need young men like you
in my department so if youll-
thank you sir i said but im
going to set up my own office with that
reward money im going to be an in-
dependent investigator

  he broke off and sank back in his
chair i still dont see how you man-

aged it that gang had planned the
whole snatch to the last detail wheat-
lands disguise was so good that he even
fooled the other teachers harpe was
completely hidden and had his gun in
hand the oriental semed to be only
a servant yet you found them out
captured them and turned them over
with full convicting evidence in the
form of wheatlands kidnap letter
whats your method anyway

  my hand crept into my side-pocket
and touched two little shells of glass
it would be hard to explain i hesi-
tated

  all i can call it is insight nodded
the chief of detectives

  yes sir insight

  in my mind i began to plan my work
id keep the secret for a while use it
to detect crime and build up a reputa-
tion id have a laboratory to develop
this x-ray gadget and other things
some day maybe when i retired id
tell the world   

  a knock sounded at the door and a
clerk stuck his head in

  mr sterrett he called mr can-
non and his daughter want to know
when youll be ready to go to dinner
with them

  gee how would i ever tell marjorie

are powerful machines of scientific destruction the greatest strength of a
country at war or is there a more sinister instrument known as subtle

 propaganda

by walter

truth like a gem has many
faces you do not know it until
you have looked at them all
more and still more books on the late
war between the confederacy and the
alliance roll from the presses if i pre-
sume to add further printed matter to
this vast and growing pile it is in the
hope of providing one more facet
unique if small to the gem of truth

  the hope is i think reasonable my
position as science editor of the new
york times-tribune afforded me both

hasbrook

a behind-the-scenes entree and a birds-
eye view of the technical developments
of the war much of my time is spent
burrowing in dusty library files search-
ing out facts available to all but known
to few again much is spent in inter-
views extracting the facts of tomorrow
from the vital minds of today

a nother big war was foreseen as

   	far back as the thirties and the
nations had set about grimly preparing
for it the expensiveness of the prepa-

prophecy in this smashing feature-length future-science novelette

ration may have been responsible for
postponing it more than thirty years
the generals would go around to a gov-
ernment and say were in danger of
being attacked by countries a b and
c therefore we need such-and-such
an armament you just give us the
money and in three years well be
ready for any eventuality the gov-
ernment would groan and say mon
dieu thatll ruin us and then give in
the military measures would be taken
and then theyd find that all their neigh-
bors had done likewise so that they
were relatively no better off than they
had been before so the whole business
would begin over again

  the ideal solution for any one nation
would have been to have a greater ar-
mament than all the rest of the world
combined but no nation was in a posi-
tion to do that-especially since china
had ceased to be one nation and was
divided into eastern and western halves
under the japanese heel and in russian
leading-strings respectively

  in due course two of the future com-
batants found themselves ready at
once and the necessary insignificant
excuse was found and the war was on
within a year we were in it despite
our good resolutions-or were they
good since we shall never know what
would have happened if we had stayed
out there is no scientific way of set-
tling the question

  i was hired by the army intelligence
service as a part-time civilian em-
ployee an employee because modern
intelligence work consists of besides
active espionage an enormous amount
of study and comparison of public or
semi-public documents such as gov-
ernmental reports yearbooks patent-
uffice publications etc by which valu-
able information can be pieced together
out of unintentional hints a civilian
because my work was to be known only
to my employers part-time because

intelligence valued my contacts with
sources of news that didnt always pass
through the military censors hands i
had had plenty of practice at this kind
of work in private life

  on the evening of may   ad-
miral dahlgren called at my apartment
which was as usual knee-deep in papers
-though of course i kept no confiden-
tial ones there after we had talked
of this and that he said young man
your technical friends are driving us
nuts again it was bad enough when
they pushed airplane speeds up into
the four hundreds and upset all our
calculations but we knew the compres-
sibility-burble point put a ceiling on
that and that they couldnt get very far
over five hundred now theyve begun
putting these auxiliary rocket-tube on
bombers to enable them to spring away
from pursuit-planes and compressibil-
ity-burble doesnt matter so god
knows what theyll do to our figures
now they may go up over a thousand
hmp damn it wheres my pipe

  they have i said

  what

ure havent you navy people
heard about it its a new arado
that flies on its tubes alone except in
taking off and landing and its said to
do around twelve hundred miles an
hour its for photography only be-
cause at that speed you cant hit any-
thing much smaller than manhattan
with a bomb doesnt even carry a
gun bccause things go by too fast to
aim at them

  hmp if your boys know about it
ours probably do too only they didnt
bother to tell me nobody ever tells
me anything he complained damn
it what did i do with those matches
i suppose those dumbunny designers
of ours got caught flatfooted as usual
hmp have to put the screws  them
theyve been promising us an effective
ananias



rocket-ship for six months damn it
ah-h the admiral had found his

matches

  you know hasbrook he went on
the more i look at this war the pho-
nier the ostensible reasons for it seem
the idea that the members of the alli-
ance are fighting for needed natural
resources has been worn pretty thin by
our modern advances in chemistry
agronomy and so forth you dont need
much resources to support your people
nowadays on our side we talk about
saving democracy but i notice that our
line-up includes some very peculiar-
looking democracies-the regime of the
argentine cattle-barons for instance i
suppose though that you cant be too
fussy about your friends or you wont
have any

  if i were to try to put in words my
own feelings id say that we were after
tangible things such as food clothes
shelter and entertainment for our folks
we may not know just how to get them
but at least there are such things the
other side seems to be fighting for
things that either dont exist such as
the purity of their race or whose ex-
istence cant be proved such as the
divinity of their ruler

  theyre also after their national
honor which as nearly as i can make
out is the kind of prestige you get by
inflicting insult and injury on another
and getting away with it so every so
often they have to injure or humiliate
their neighbors as a matter of princi-
ple previous promises to the contrary
notwithstanding hmp

  the hell of it is that you can get
people fighting over these imaginary
abstractions such as honor if anything
more easily than over real objectives
and the alliance knows it-at least that
devil raiberti knows it here my
crusty friend exhausted his stock of
four-letter words on the alliances chief
of public enlightenment and with

everybody carrying a radio the size of
a watch we cant stop him we cant
even blanket these wave-crest modu-
lated sets without smothering all our
own stuff at the same time if your
technical friends-

  just then the world outside was lit
up as by a noon sun then came a
sound-the sort you feel rather than
hear but i should describe it as a vast
grunt

t came to lying in a corner of the

  room i couldnt have been out more
than a second or two because through
my now gaping window came a long-
drawn-out roar made i later learned
by tons of steel and masonry showering
on lower manhattan

  the admiral was already up swear-
ing in six languages the lights slowly
came on again the roar died to be
replaced by official sirens and gongs
to the south over the hedge of sky-
scrapers a red glow lighted the belly
of an immense smoke-cloud we tried
the telephone but at first it didnt work
and when it did all the numbers we
called for information were busy

  as i stepped back to the window a
piece of paper the size of a playing-
card fluttered in across the top in
-point bold-face were the words
dont be a sucker buddy and be-
low it one of the cleverly-worded ap-
peals of raibertis gang proving that
the alliance really thought the world
of us but that we were misled by our
scheming politicians

  there was no mystery about it the
alliance had sent a radio-controlled
rocket a couple of hundred feet long
with a mighty charge of explosive in its
nose across the atlantic from the alps
when it was almost over new york a
number of little auxiliary rockets full
of these love-notes had been released to
scatter their load while the big one
dove into the financial district


dynamic science stories

  the next day i got a pass to the
scene of the explosion where the city
bank farmers trust building had been
was now a large hole pafrtlf filled with
steel beams twisted into pretzel shapes
the skeletons of the surrounding sky-
scrapers were mostly still standing but
all the masonry had been blown away
because of the financial districts
sparse night population there had been
less loss of life there than was caused
by the fall of debris elsewhere some
of it fell as far north as times square

  i was out at fort montauk the night
the second-and last-of these visitors
came a battery of new guns had been
put up so hurriedly that there were
footprints in the emplacements where
the crews had walked before the con-
crete was dry the guns themselves
looked incredibly large but that was
because of the water-jackets six feet in
diameter including the cooling-fins
around their barrels a cooling-unit the
size of a box-car full of blowers and
radiators was required to dissipate the
heat developed by their thirty-rounds-
a-minute fire

  i descended into the fire-control
room which was full of men uncon-
cernedly smoking while looking at in-
dicators and oscillographs and pushing
buttons and turning knobs the main
view-plate was a four-foot glass square
black except for a grid of green lines
the adjutant explained this and that
to me and a buzzer sounded the op-
erator in front of the main plate said
over his shoulder here she comes
i saw the men tense themselves

a t the top of the plate a white dot
appeared and moved slowly down
the glass leaving a thread of purple
light behind it  held my breath but
you cant do that for ten minutes and
the rocket was still far out of range
the minutes crawled by the silence
complete except for the breathing of

the men and the tiny noises of their
instruments

  the dot reached a line a little heavier
than the others and i knew that the
rocket was fifty miles out and angling
down from the stratosphere the oper-
ator pressed another buzzer through
the concrete the firing of the guns came
to us as a tattoo of thurfips i was glad
i wasnt outside of all guns the six-
inch is hardest on eardrums but the
eight-inch which these were is not far
behind it

  little dots of red appeared on the
plate closer and closer to the white dot
until they looked like a cluster of gems
the white dot seemed to swerve slight-
ly and turned red meaning that it was
dropping out of the plane represented
by the plate the operator spun a
handwheel and brought it back to white
again he kept turning turning until
his altitude dial showed zero the white
dot flickered and disappeared some-
where out on the atlantic a column of
steam marked the end of the rocket
it was all over the defense had caught
up with the offense again

  it had caught up elsewhere too
the main cities of europe were buried
in sandbags and sheathed with explo-
sion-mats and ringed with guns that
could in a twinkling blast out of the
sky any hostile aircraft regardless of
its speed or the weather conditions on
the battlefields long lines of concealed
gun-emplacements peered at each other
from behind barbed-wire concealed
pits fences of railroad-irons stuck up-
right in the ground land mines and
every other defense that desperate men
could devise no-mans land was sprin-
kled with the remains of men and of
tanks that had tried to cross the space
the gun-crews groped for each other
with sound-detettors infra-red detec-
tors and seismographic detectors and
fired when a shot went home the gun
and its crew were replaced and the war
ananias



went on

 our turkish friends drove through
thrace for a few miles and were
stopped by the balkan army under
vacarescu the indians were slowly
pinched back into begal by the vast
japanese-officered chinese armies of
the alliance with the help of a few
siamese divisions things went against
us in uruguay

  as the battlefields became more lit-
tered and shell-pitted and as the con-
testants dug themselves in deeper the
snail-like pace of the war asymptoti-
cally approached a dead stop but in
the minds of men another kind of war
was being fought you bought a pack
of cigarettes the third one that you
took out suddenly unrolled into a strip
of paper bearing a propaganda mes-
sage you called the police who ar-
rested the clerk the delivery-man the
dealer and everybody at the cigarette-
factory through whose hands the
smoke might have passed their unan-
imous denial of knowing anything
stood up under the lie-detectors you
couldnt shoot them all in the hope of
getting the hostile agent youd have to
kill too large a proportion of the popu-
lation and besides that was the sort of
barbarity practiced by the alliance
whereas our side was supposed to be
more humane

vou bought a head of lettuce and

  	the grocer made out your receipted
bill the bill was normal enough when
he stuffed it in the paper bag of pro-
visions but by the time you got home
it had changed into one of raibertis

rested again without result

  admiral dahlgren looking in civil-
ian clothcs more than ever like a
minnesota farmer was in my apart-
ment one evening when i turned on the
radio i set it for a commercial station
but when i threw the switch a hearty

voice said   statement by senator
james now folks we dont like to
doubt a senators word but when you
consider that in  he was held for
mental observation in the des moines
city hospital we think it should be
taken with a grain of salt im afraid
youre being taken for a little ride
folks if you want to know how he got
his dough id suggest you look into the
matter of the oregon timber leases of
 and compare that with f the
voice was drowned in a blare of dance-
music the commercial station no
doubt in response to frantic official
telephone calls had changed their
wave-form to blanket the alliance sta-
tion

  the swine barked the admiral
i get a lot of inside dope and i know
james had nothing to do with that
scandal but theyre so damned clever
that their biggest lies are of a kind you
cant absolutely disprove remember
the last time they pulled that insanity
gag they said president mcrae had
been in the looney-bin at white plains
then it turned out that a small fire had
destroyed that hospitals records so
that no matter what mcrae said there
was always a shade of doubt in peoples
minds hmp

  another time he brought up an in-
dividual who looked like a neo-vorticist
poet whom he introduced as dr quen-
tin hoyle the psychologist i was sur-
prised id met many psychiatrists but
most of them were men of conservative
appearance designed to give confidence
to their patients

  the admiral spoke gloomily of the
war same old story limp trouble
on the ukrainian front trouble on the
chinese front-morale they had a lit-
tle mutiny in the chinese soviets nd
division propaganda of course any-
body who can beat the communists at
that game is good you probably
havent heard about it the mutiny


dynamic science stories

story should have been censored out
before it got to you

  no i replied i havent but i
have heard about our own morale trou-
bles in the south and the midlands
raibertis song-and-dance has been
making headway in the chicago area
the admiral was going through his
usual motions of hunting for a match
damn damn whered i put them
you know hasbrook our technics
are easily as good as the alliances but
in this public enlightenment business
they make our best advertising men
and psychologists-with due apologies
hoyle-look like children

 i he dreamy-looking hoyle pulled
a his long hair and said repeat a
thing often enough and it leaves an
indelible impression on a mans mind
whether he wants to believe it or not
if either of you gentlemen are married
youll know what i mean

  hmp hmp i am hasbrook isnt
that i know of i get you though doc
it sort of wears a path through the
mind doesnt it

  hoyle was silent for so long that
dahlgren thought he hadnt heard and
started to repeat but the psychologist
still looking at nothing raised his hand
wears a path yes i suppose one
could describe it thus in popular terms
i think youve said something ad-
miral if you have we may yet hoist
the alliance with their own petard
hmp what the hells a petard
tsk and you a military man its
a kind of bomb used in the later mid-
dle ages for seige work and hoist in
that sense means blow up  with
which hoyle retired into his own rare-
fied mental atmosphere refusing to
elaborate

  it was a month before the admiral
came around again the alliance was
giving our naval intelligence plenty of
overtime work you wouldnt have

guessed it from the censored newspa-
pers but i knew that the morale of the
countries of the confederacy was going
from bad to worse in the united states
there was sabotage-not by spies but
by disgruntled americans in milwau-
kee an attempted peace-at-any-price
demonstration in topeka and a lynch-
ing of an army officer in georgia in
other countries it was worse argen-
tina was practically out of the war and
australia was cracking

  i didnt wonder wherever you
turned raibertis propaganda got in
your hair if the ceasless rain of half-
truths insinuations and lies got on my
nerves i could imagine how it affected
the masses of people who lacked my
inside knowledge the usual spy-fever
was bad enough but this was some-
thing undreamed of in the old days

  the neatest trick that raibertis
agents pulled was the doctoring of a
load of newsprint on its way to the
presses of my paper so that three hours
after the papers were printed the orig-
inal print faded out and raibertis
messages took its place-just about the
time the buyers of the papers were
reading them almost as good was their
placing a miniature phonograph in the
microphone that mcrae was supposed
to use for a broadcast speech when
the president started we heard what
was apparently his voice complete
with philadelphia accent go off on a
rambling tirade denouncing congress
the army the navy the farmers the
workers and everybody else in sight
the talk being punctuated by frequent
hiccups and all the time poor mcrae
was making one of the best and most
reasonable speeches of his career it
was hardly surprising that the rumors
that raiberti had started concerning
the presidents sanity revived

yyhen dahlgren did come around
 again he brought a gang there
ananias



wa the poetic-looking hoyle and a
dark man who combined the outlines
and manner of an iowa realtor with a
buttery oxford accent he was intro-
duced as colonel bosh of the indian
army the last man whose name the
admiral said was mr tsung was an
obvious eastern asiatic when i got a
good look at him something went
click i almost said phil but
stopped at the ph

  tsung simultaneously recognized
me and almost spoke but checked him-
self then he laughed we might as
well own up walt the admiral knows
who i am but he didnt know that you
did

  years before i had gone to high-
school in california with a japanese-
american boy named philip okuma
he had-an incredible thing unless
you knew him-been elected student-
body president but some local patri-
otic society became exercised and
forced a change in our so-called con-
stitution so that poor phil was eu-
chered out of his job the experience
hadnt soured him

  now he mentioned that he was doing
intelligence work what else is there
he asked my people have been in
this country for three generations but
a lot of good that does me when every
jap is supposed to be a spy a saboteur
an emperor-worshiper and a lot of
other things and in japan id be con-
sidered a foreigner who had been ex-
posed to the wicked and impious ideas
of the western barbarians he
laughed again

  the admiral called the meeting to
order hoyle handed him a little black
cylinder about the size of the eraser
in the end of an ordinary pencil

  colonel bosh dahlgren said
your job is this your agents are to
introduce these-these things into the
electrical communications of the
enemy in burma without getting

caught you have i know pulled risk-
ier jobs before im having the techni-
cal details typed and photo-offset
youll get them tomorrow tsung here
-okuma that is-is to get the first
ones installed in japan im sorry we
had to deprive you of a good molar
okuma but i think youll find that the
fake one we gave you to hold the-
hmp-capsule works well the capsule
once installed cannot be removed
without setting off a minute charge of
thermite in it that will destroy it i
cant tell you how it works not even
you hasbrook but you can take my
word that it does when it and we
hope several thousand more like it
have been given a chance to work your
general staff will be given the necessary
information

  bosh who was i knew a much more
dangerous man than one would have
suspected from his aggressively harm-
less exterior made a fatuous little
speech about doing ones duty for ones
paw people sir we talked of this and
that and they went

in about a month my sources began
 to turn up incredible reports a jap-
anese cruiser squadron was caught and
wiped out off the kuriles by a superior
russo-american force their com-
mander fished out of the water and
forcibly prevented from committing
suicide babbled that his rear admiral
had said to go ahead because the whole
battlefleet was right behind him when
we knew that there were no japanese
battleships within hundreds of miles

  in lithuania general czarnewicz
was court-martialed and shot by the
alliance high command for saying that
all was quiet on his front when actu-
ally the russians had broken bis line
and he was just about to jump in his
car and flee to avoid being run over by
his own retreating troops

started an offensive with one days am-

were pitiful the indians almost got
across burma into siam before they
were effectively opposed and their ad-
vance was stopped more by the clog-
ging of their supply lines with hun-
dreds of thousands of prisoners than by
the frantic efforts of the alliance
armies i suspected that somehow our
buttery friend bosh was at the bottom
of the debacle

  then one afternoon the admiral
paid me another visit his last one dur-
ing the war that damn place is nois-
ier than a triple eighteen-inch turret
he said referring to his office every
three minutes somebody pops in with
a sir what do i do with this now or a
sir commander zilch sends his com-
pliments and wants to know some-
thing and so on ive got to get these
reports read so i came up here listen
hasbrook will you call up on that se-
cret phone of yours and arrange to
have any important intelligence
phoned up big news is likely to break
any minute

  he settled down to his reports pres-
ently the bell rang and in walked
philip okuma to the admirals and
my questions as to what in hell he was
doing here he replied that hed just
been flown over from siberia and
hadnt found dahlgren in his office
when he went there to report

  for a while he said i had no
trouble installing the capsules as i had
been given the rank of corporal in the
imperial army and was assigned to

headquarters as a stenographer but
as a result of the operation of the cap-
sules thered been some bad losses on
the manchurian front and the first
thing i knew i was shipped off to the
trenches leaving my subordinates in
intelligence to carry on the good work
with the capsules

  i soon found that morale wasnt
very good in my outfit the reason being
that people at headquarters had been
making so many statements that failed
to prove true

nyway last wreek we were or-
dered to advance across the sun-
gari the advance went fine with am-
phibian tanks to support it-except
that our battalion was on the extreme
left of the brigade and suddenly found
that the brigade next to us had simply
pulled out for no apparent reason and
gone home of course you never real-
ize just whats going on on a battlefield
but i was chief battalion runner and
got a better idea than most of the men

  with our flank in the air the en-
emy-that is to say the enemy of the
army in which i was ostensibly serv-
ing-wasted no time and we had to fall
back on the sungari we dug in in
some marshy ground on the inside of a
bend in the river and waited our
batallion had only four officers left a
captain ishii and three lieutenants we
sat in the mud for three days and ran
out of most of our ammunition and all
of our food

  the phone rang for the admiral
when he finished listening he said with
a broad grin the brazilian army has
asked for an armistice told you some-
thing was going to pop go on oku-
ma

  as i was saying we sat there with
captain ishii trying by radio to get
something done about our precarious
position finally headquarters an-
nounced that they were sending some
ananias



planes over to drop supplies and asked
our exact location which was given

  pretty soon the airplanes appeared
but instead of supplies a bomb came
whooshing down and we scuttled for
our holes like a lot of prairie-dogs the
planes dropped three more before the
captain by frantically waving a jap-
anese flag got their attention

  i could guess what had happened
a capsule had been influencing the op-
erator at headquarters and he when
given the position of our battalion had
reported it as that of a group of the
enemy the bombs hadnt done much
damage because of the softness of the
ground but i still felt that the capsules
were working a little too well for my
comfort having been brought up in
this country i havent quite the fatal-
istic attitude about death that a true
japanese possesses

  after the planes had gone and
captain ishii had protested loudly into
his radio an amphibian supply-carrier
appeared across the river splashed into
it and puttered over it crawled out on
its tracks and the driver hove out four
large boxes these sir he said to
ishii are your food and ammunition

  ishii looked puzzled why are the
boxes marked woolen mittens he
asked

  the driver answered the honor-
able headquarters did not inform me
sir and drove his machine back the
way it had come

  we hacked open the boxes in a hur-
ry i can tell you you can imagine the
feelings of those soldiers when the first
was full of-woolen mittens the sec-
ond and third were likewise

  captain ishii said in a strangled
voice open the remaining box we
did and it contained -woolen mittens

  just then captain ishii spotted
sergeant wada reading one of the in-
numerable propaganda leaflets with
which the russian planes had show-

ered us sergeant he barked i
thought i told you not to read those
again

   he sergeant just looked at him
and said sure you did but i didnt
promise not to

  ishii looked as though he were go-
ing to have apoplexy not only was the
sergeant being insubordinate but he
was using the forbidden fourth in-
flexion the japanese language has
four inflections implying different de-
grees of politeness ordinarily officers
use the contemptuous fourth to en-
listed men and enlisted men use the
respectful second to officers the ser-
geants use of the fourth was a mortal
insult

  sergeant wada went on further-
more ill do as i damn please you
and the rest of the officers have been
fooling us long enough youve given
us every reason to believe that these
russians-here he waved the paper-
are right after all when they say that
all this talk about the divinity of the
emperor and the glory of the empire
is just a racket in war you expect
people in authority to lie especially to
the enemy and to the masses on their
own side but the members of our high
command lie not only to us but to each
other as well that bombing this morn-
ing and these mittens arent the first
of such happenings but as far as im
concerned theyll be the last nobody
in his right mind wants to fight for such
crazy people whos with me

  ishii whipped out his big old samu-
rai sword and started for wada but a
big gun went off and the captain fell
with his face in a puddle we were as-
tonished to see that lieutenant tatsuta
had killed him but then these lieu-
tenants were all pretty fresh from the
ranks the shortage of officers had
made it necessary to promote them in a
hurry a id they couldnt be expected to


dynamic science stories

take the samurai code as seriously as
the military-academy products

  tatsuta said to wada im with
you i think youre right how about
you kanzaki speaking to one of the
other two lieutenants

  kanzaki said the samurai code
leaves me but one course and before
anybody could move he had pulled his
pistol and blown his brains out

   you ichikawa said tatsuta to
the remaining looey a nervous little
rabbity man ichikawa answered
we-ell i suppose i really ought to kill
myself too but a lot of queer things
have been happening and if it should
turn out that wada is right and the sa-
murai code is actually the bunk id
have killed myself for no good reason
and if it transpires that wada is
wrong it will always be easy enough
to kill myself when that time comes so
i think ill go with you boys for a while
and see what happens

  we hoisted a white flag and pretty
soon a tank rattled over the nearest rise
and up to the edge of the soft ground
a man in a russian uniform got out
and asked us in a strong mongol accent
who was in command

   hat was embarrassing because
obviously sergeant wada was the
commander de facto and lieutenant
tatsuta was the commander de jure
they began arguing about it bowing
and hissing politely through their teeth
but the mongol officer said to skip it
and ordered us to fall in as we start-
ed to march away one little private
asked the mongol if he was going to
have us killed the officer just grinned
and said why should we youll all
be good communists by the time we
get through with you 

  the phone rang again when the
admiral had finished listening this time
he was fairly bursting poland has
quit in italy theyve set up something

called a co-operative republic though
how co-operative and how repub-
lican it is remains to be seen von
freygang has killed himself the king
of the south slavs fled from his palace
in his pajamas and when last seen was
pulling his pants on in the cabin of his
private plane just before it took off
he paused for breath while he was
getting it i suggested getting our cele-
brating in early before the streets be-
came packed he said sure sure but
wed better bring along the man who
really did this-you know the brain
guy hoyle so he called the psycholo-
gist and we picked up him and his wife
on our way to the hotel

  the steak wasnt up to my idea of a
celebration steak but meat prices were
still astronomical as a result of war
rationing we drank enough cocktails
so that all the food tasted pretty good
whether it was or not and the admiral
said to hoyle hasbrook here has been
asking me leading questions ever since
i had you up to his place trying to find
how your capsule works i guess it
wouldnt hurt to tell him now espe-
cially as hes the most discreet man i
know except maybe okuma here damn
it

  hoyle brought his eyes slowly back
into focus capsule he said vague-
ly oh yes thats what you call my
transmitter he gazed into space for
a moment

  remember mr hasbrook when
the admiral spoke of wearing a path
through the mind that gave me the
idea every thought every mental im-
age every sense-impression consists es-
sentially of an electric discharge-pat-
tern between millions of neurons in the
cortex of the brain the pattern is so
complicated that it is better described
as a web than as a path

  but its a definite linkage between
definite cells and the passage of electric
current quasi-permanently lowers the
ananias



resistance of the synapses between the
neurons therefore one can re-create
the pattern at will or rather electrical-
ly re-activate a pattern already creat-
ed this we call remembering

  in the setting up of one of these
patterns by the lowering of resistance
through certain synapses many small
discharges are as effective as one large
one therefore an unnoticed sound
that one hears or a sight that one sees
daily becomes an integral part of ones
personality

ty transmitter was designed to be
placed in the regular transmitter
of any electrical communication sys-
tem either wire or wireless and con-
nected in parallel with the transmitter
circuit it was so constructed that
when the circuit was activated the little
transmitter would feed a sound-modu-
lated current of the same frequency as
that of the main circuit into it the
added current would carry a simple
word-pattern urging the listener to lie
for instance the transmitters installed
in germany said les ist gut zu liigen-
cs ist gut zu liigen over and over

   the listener would not actually hear
-the

these words because they were a mere
inaudible murmur superimposed on the
conversation of the speaker but if
he used the instrument often enough
the minute neuronic impulses caused by
these sounds would in time wear the
necessary paths in his brain and hed
believe it was good to liigen with
these devices installed in the telephones
and radios used by the dictators minis-
ters and general staffs of the alliance
countries the result was what we have
seen in other words we made patho-
logical liars out of them

   he paused again and i could imagine
millions of resentful soldiers taking
their destinies into their own hands of
their officers some yelling threatening
and being contemptuously shot down
others discreetly removing their insig-
nia and joining their men

   thats what i meant by saying that
wed hoist them with their own petard
all these men have made such extensive
use of that never-obsolete weapon the
lie and theyre all such accomplished
liars anyway that it didnt take as
much of this form of suggestion to
achieve our object as it would have with
more truthful people

chaos

the night was clear and moon-
less with scintillating star clus-
ters frosting the sombre sky as
sven hagart stood with legs spread sol-
idly against the wallowing roll of the

in the ice beneath ho could see the bodies of
scores of men

when anthropologist george kane
lost in the frozen arctic stumbled on
that strange workroom deep in the
blue depths of a glacier he thought
he had found sanctuary but he had
discovered a mad scientists ice-palace
laboratory-and a wild scheme to
plunge the world into chaos by de-
magnetizing the north pole

trawler annisquatn harbor bound his
thick hairy hands gripped the wheel
tightly and his strong teeth were
clamped on the stem of his short pipe
behind thick-lensed spectacles his pale
eyes probed the darkness from time
to time he screwed up his lips and spat
through the open window of the pilot
house into the phosphorescent sea

over the monotonous throb of the
engine came the sound of the crew talk-

ing lazily as they listened to one of
them playing melodious chords on a
harmonica hagart smiled to himself
his weathered face aglow in the feeble
light of the binnacle the days haul
had been good the crew was in fine fet-
tle and the engine hitting well the
sea was running comparatively calm
with long ground swells by force of
habit he thrust his head through the
window and glanced upwards at polaris
under the north pole



for checking with the compass

  absently his eyes shuttled back to
the binnacle and in the next instant his
face became blank with astonishment
and his pipe sagged in his lips sven
hagart gaped incredulously at the
rocking disc of the compass and then
his strong teeth were clamping on the
pipe stem with such power that it
snapped off ar det mojligtl he mur-
mured has the stars gone crazy or
iss i asleep

  he blinked a couple of times then
looked out again polaris was only half
a point off the starboard bow shining
bright and clear again his troubled
eyes sought the compass and narrowed
quickly he becketted the wheel re-
moved his spectacles and polished them
vigorously perhaps spray had warped
his vision    but he sensed differently
as he replaced the glasses setting them
into their customary place

  for the third time he stared at the
north star and back at the binnacle
again his face seemed to drain of all
color and jyith a throaty exclamation
of alarm and puzzlement he thrust his
head through the door and yelled
eric nathan come quick some-
thing iss  i dont know what

instantly the harmonica silenced
a there was a scramble of feet on deck
sven stood by the binnacle pointing an
accusing finger at the compass it says
noreast he burst out an the star
is just off the starboard quarter how
can we be goin noreast an nor-by-
west at the same time

  the seamen crowded about him and
stared one of them rocked the binna-
cle and the compass rolled lazily past
the point it had been holding farther
east tensely they watched expecting
it to halt and swing back but the disc
continued to move steadily in a full cir-
cle

  alarmed the men examined it noth-

ing seemed out of whack and there was
no metal near to throw it off but the
disc kept on swinging aimlessly through
ninety degrees of arc as if immune to
the customary magnetic attraction
sven threw up his hands helplessly iss
we crazy or iss it or iss the stars just
flying around like lightning bugs

  at exactly that moment all over the
northern hemisphere men were staring
unbelievingly at compasses which re-
fused to make sense the captains of
great liners flashed messages back and
forth asking bearings afraid to believe
their time-tried indicators and yet
afraid not to puzzled by the strange
discrepancies between gyro-compasses
and magnetic compasses astronomers
found their telescopes off as much as
one hundred and eighty degrees-ac-
cording to stationary exact compasses
they radioed back and forth demand-
ing to know if the same thing were
happening at other observatories

  air-liner pilots suddenly found them-
selves flying two hundred miles per hour 
in exactly the opposite direction from
what they had been pursuing five min-
utes before and even as they watched
the maddening cylinders of their instru-
ments continued to swing about now
registering east now west now north
even south

  for three hours the ether boiled with
frantic messages from men who were
lost at sea or aimlessly cruising the
skies afraid to land from lighthouse
keepers who thought their great stone
towers were twisting on sinking bases
the naval observatory spent a desper-
ate hour trying to solve the riddle and
finally gave up and sat with folded
hands awaiting the answer

  and after three hours the erratic
needles of half the worlds compasses
gradually moved back and took up the
positions hey had held for thousands
of years-due north once more the


dynamic science stories

stars agreed with the faithful slender
needles of steel or the broad disks of
mariners compasses whatever it had
been the crisis was over

                              

  and in all the world there was onjy
one man who knew what was happen-
ing and that man was too far away to
be of any help besides george kane
was having troubles of his own at that
moment he stood-figuratively and
literally-on the brink of death

  for three days after he was sepa-
rated from the rest of his party on
prince of wales of ireland tall bony
young kane struggled to find them
there were six members of the expedi-
tion sent up by the smithsonian insti-
tute and kane was the youngest of
them but after endless hours of wan-
dering about he realized he was hope-
lessly lost

  the young anthropologist leader of
an expedition to investigate rumors of
a strange race in the arctic-rumors
they had dispelled-was in the most
difficult spot of his life he had no food
no water

pesperately he stumbled
ahead his feet were so nearly
frozen that he couldnt move his toes
inside the thick boots nor could he flex
his fingers he lost all consciousness
of time and seemed to see nothing but
snow all his senses were blended into
one great empty feeling of being hope-
lessly lost but the flame of hope is un-
quenchable in man it kept him strug-
gling ahead long after his strength was
really used up

  and then after endless hours george
kane suddenly straightened up and lis-
tened his drawn face took on a new
intensity frowning he stared at the
ground there was a peculiar pounding
beneath his feet at first he thought
he had strayed onto ice and that it was
cracking but soon he realized the sound

was different

  it was steady regular it was like
an engine heard at a great distance
only this was felt instead of heard for
a long time he stood and tried to figure
it out then he looked ahead

  through a sudden rift in the blizzard
he made out a tiny black objept like a
small tank he shouted and struggled
ahead when he had reached it he
stopped and went up to it it was a
sort of chimney that came out of the
deep snow the top of it was a trap
door with a large handle on it whereby
it could be opened he found after scrap-
ing away the snow

  kane was in no condition to wonder
about it he tore at the handle and
found he could swing it open he threw
it back and then stared down it was
dark inside he dug out a match and
struck it by its light he saw an iron
ladder going down the cylindrical wall
he dropped the match and in the in-
stant before it went out he saw that the
ladder went down into dim obscurity

  now he swung into it clumsily be-
cause of his bulky clothing and started
down into blackness for long minutes
he continued to descend the iron rungs
after a long time he made out some
sort of illumination looking down he
made out an opalescent glow

  hurriedly for all his weakness the
young scientist climbed on so intent
was he on not missing any rungs that
he was unprepared for it when abruptly
his feet hit a floor he swung around
he was in a sort of vestibule the walls
were apparently of slick ice and the
floor the same ten feet from him was
a doorway cut in the thick ice he stag-
gered through it

  in the next moment he was standing
stock-still his eyes big with wonder-
ment the scene before him was like
a setting from some unearthly fantasy
he stood at the entrance to a great cav-
ern of ice the ceiling was twenty or
under the north pole



thirty feet above the floor and cut like
a mighty dome polished slender pil-
lars of ice climbed from floor to roof
the walls were jagged and irregular
curving from where he stood in great
semi-circles that met again two hundred
feet from him

  the floor was of ice too but rough-
ened in a serrated pattern that rendered
it less slippery there was no visible
lighting equipment but walls floor and
ceiling were luminous with a soft blue
light

  against the ice wall at his left was a
monstrous black mass of machinery that
rumbled and shook the whole place
it was apparent now where the strange
pounding effect had come from the
machinery was compact and powerful
looking and motionless except for a
huge flywheel that spun swiftly and si-
lently

  at the other side of the cavern a
tremendous coil like a great corkscrew
wound from beneath the floor into the
ceiling the six-feet-thick coil was of
some steely-green material that defied
kanes efforts to place it

  stunned with the magnitude of the
scene and with finding signs of a mod-
ern civilization this far north kane
shuffled silently ahead his weary body
threatened to fail him completely as this
new burden of amazement was put on
it and then over the rumble of the
machinery a womans cry echoed down
the hall

  uncle someones in the door

 eorge kanes eyes rushed to
the point from which the sound
had come his mouth dropped open
one more marvel had been revealed in
this room of miracles-the most beauti-
ful woman the young scientist had ever
seen

  she stood only twenty feet away
with her hand against her throat in an
attitude of startled surprise she had

just stepped from behind a pillar of ice
which had kept her from seeing him
before her small shapely form was
clothed in a close-fitting jacket of fine
white fur and a flaring skirt of the same
material with short eskimo boots on
her small feet against the soft white
fur her dark hair was framed in deep
waves

  her lips made a small surprised o
and the blue eyes were opened wide

  from a door behind the girl hurried
three men one of them was tall and
broad-shouldered with a short clipped
beard his face was white and intense
but it was the eyes which drew kanes
gaze they burned below his craggy
black brows like chips of green fire
they were filled with hate and ven-
geance suddenly his hand slid be-
neath the gray smock he wore and
jerked a gun free

  the shocked anthropologist was too
startled to move through his weary
body flowed a sudden flood of inertia
and of the desire to give up three
days of fighting snow and ice and bliz-
zard two days without food had not
prepared him for the rapid-fire trend
events were taking

  as if time had been slowed down he
saw the black-bearded mans finger
tighten on the trigger of the pistol he
stood stoically awaiting the roar of the
gun and the smashing impact of a bul-
let but the bullet was not fired be-
tween them a small white form flew
the girl screamed stop maybe hes
not-

  kane swayed a little he saw the
hammer of the gun pull back inexor-
ably then the great cavern seemed to
explode and he was pitching down into
blue depths of glacial ice

below the pole

  a fter a long time kanes mind
seemed to climb back to the
- things of reality he had no de-
sire to open his eyes for he was tired
clear through when finally he looked
around him he saw he had been moved
the room he was in yas small but
carved from ice as the cavern had been
he got one elbow beneath him and
forced himself up

  how do you feel someone asked
quietly it was the soft friendly voice
of the girl

  he whirled to see her standing near
the head of the cot he lay on there
was deep concern in the depths of her
dark eyes

  kane shook his head weak he
muttered and hungry he said
the last with such emphasis that the
girl laughed

  i was expecting that she told him
if you think you can get into the next
room ill fix you all the ham and eggs
you can eat

  ham and eggs george kane was
dragging himself from the bed in a sec-
ond a steaming vision of the food be-
fore him he strode after her into the
small dining room in a few minutes
he was seated at a long table stuffing
himself with the warm vitalizing food
he war too starved to wonder at these
delicacies as far north as this

  while he ate the three men he had
seen before-including the one who had
been intent on killing him-came in
and sat near him watching wordlessly
kane looked them over while he ate
the first man seemed to have cooled
down considerably his expression was
cold and hostile

  the other men consisted of a long
bony individual with a gaunt white

face and a short stocky man with a
heavily bearded face and a completely
bald head

  the scientists eyes kept coming back
to the thin cruel face of the man who
was obviously the leader there was a
familiar cast to the high cheek-bones
and the sunken green eyes and the
way the dark hair was bushy at the
sides and nearly flat on top struck a
responding chord in his memory

  when at last he laid down his fork
and pushed back his chair the other
spoke be good enough to tell us who
you are he clipped

  kane shot him a hostile look im
george kane he said shortly i got
separated from my party two days
ago after an expedition to prince of
wales island and i was lucky enough
to stumble on this place now maybe
youll be good enough jo tell me why i
was almost greeted with a bullet

  the other shrugged and a bleak smile
touched his lips we have enemies
he said simply in the surprise of see-
ing you here i mistook you for one
of them i must apologize for the rude
reception you received but that is
finished he gestured at the two men
near him villers and cahill my as-
sistants he introduced without turn-
ing his head i am henry cameron
and this is my niece sharon

  henry cameron kane caught his
breath at last he remembered the man
henry cameron had received the nobel
prize three years ago for his work in
steel he had made the first revolu-
tionary discovery in years the inven-
tion of a process by which steel and
iron could be magnetized to a point
almost unbelievable his process had
outmoded in a few months the great
electromagnets used in stnel mills for
carrying great pieces of iron a piece
of his metal one-tenth the size of for-
mer magnets could do the work of an
electromagnet and obviate the neces-
under the north pole



sity for expensive current cameron had
made millions in two years

amerons shrewd eyes caught
 the recognition that lighted the
others face quietly he said how
soon can you leave

  uncle sharon cameron broke in
how can you ask that when mr kane
has just recovered long enough to eat
one meal

  camerons eyes avoided hers after
a moment he shrugged very well i
think after two days you should be suf-
ficiently recovered to go on the storm
will be over by then and ill see that
you have food enough to carry you to
the settlement but there was a veiled
menace in his eyes that the younger
man did not miss he nodded at the
girl im sure my niece will be glad
to show you around

  followed by the other two men the
tall cahill and stocky villers he strode
out

  sharon tried to explain my uncle
is very-brusque to strangers she
stammered im sure youll be wel-
come to stay as long as you like after
he knows you better

  kaneot up and took  deep breath
the strength seemed to come surging
back into his body as the warm food
brought a welcome glow to him he
stood tall and erect a rather lanky fig-
ure his eyes were whimsical as he
said if he shoots at men when hes
being brusque id hate to get him
mad he might not miss next time

  a smile parted the girls rich lips
then turning she said perhaps
youd like to see more of this unearthly
place youve stumbled into come
along

  at her heels george kane stalked
out through a short hall into the im-
mense cavern

  tell me one thing he said ear-
nestly as he caught up with her just

what and why is all this who built it
or carved it and what does it do
to begin at the first question
sharon smiled the caverns were cut
out by a tribe of eskimos my uncle
brought here to do the work i never
saw them because ive only been here
a month myself uncle sent for me just
after it was finished as to why this is
-its some big oil scheme he has on
it seems he discovered an immense
pocket of oil up here and hes built his
own plant right over it thats the
pump over there she went on indi-
cating the bulky mass of machinery
its- i dont know how powerful but
it drws up oil from about eight miles
down

  eight miles kane gasped

  yes the pump is especially built to
do the work

  whats the-coil or whatever it
is kane asked some sort of still
sharon smiled and walked over to
the gargantuan coil of greenish steel or
whatever metal it was it looked like
some monstrous enclosed circular stair-
case that wound down into the bowels
of the earth thats the one thing i
cant quite understand she told him
my uncle says it has something to do
with distilling the oil

  it doesnt look like any-

  at that moment a step sounded be-
hind them villers stood close to kane
a crafty smile on his fleshy lips his
squat ugly body was relaxed in easy
self-confidence miss cameron is
right he said it is a special process
of mr camerons for refining the
crude petroleum

a sudden impulse came to the
other man to call him a liar ob-
viously there was something hidden
here cameron didnt want discussed
he stifled the desire and asked when
did cameron become interested in oil
i thought he was a steel man


dynamic science stories

  did you villers said and left it
there i was afraid miss cameron
might forget to tell you one thing so
ill let you know myself you are at
liberty to go anywhere you like in the
upper part of the structure but mr
cameron prefers that you dont go any
farther past the coil the machinery
in the interior is rather complicated
you might hurt something-or get hurt
yourself with that he strode off

  kane watched him go frowning and
then turned to the girl if you dont
mind he said quickly i think ill
shave and clean up

  sharon said quickly forgive me for
not asking you the room youre to
use is the one we brought you to after
this morning youll find everything
you need there with unconscious
nervousness she brushed hastily at a
curl that strayed over her smooth fore-
head

  kane mumbled thanks and left
her

  back in his room he took a long time
shaving heating the water in a little al-
cohol stove his mind puzzled over the
strange world into which he had
dropped he was sure cameron was
no more interested in oil than he was
and yet there was little doubt that the
machinery in the ice hall was to pump
something from the ground the
thought came to him that for a man
who had made the remarkable discov-
ery that he had in steel he forgot it in
a hurry

  a glimmer of suspicion came to him
that this might revolve about the
rumors he had heard not long ago that
the new metal was not working out so
well after a year of use the metal
seemed to lose its remarkable magnetic
power and require further processing
by henry camerons laboratories-at
camerons own expense but-they
were only rumors they might be com-
pletely unfounded

  at last shrugging he decided his im-
agination was carrying him away
camerons explanations were probably
true he was here to drill oil and nat-
urally jealous enough of his discovery
to be quick to challenge any stranger
who entered the caverns

  putting away his shaving things
kane prepared to explore the place fur-
ther perhaps a look around would jus-
tify him in thinking definitely one way
or the other he found that the back
door of his room opened on a hall he
had not yet been in

  aimlessly he wandered down it
until he wasnt quite sure where he
was seeing a door ajar he shoved it
open and walked in his mind was so
taken up with the mysteries around
him that he almost stumbled over
sharon without seeing her she was
huddled in a chair her arm flung over
the back of it and her face pressed into
the hollow of her elbow her slim
shoulders shook with sobs a soft sound
of crying of miserable heart-wrung
crying came to kane

  he strode forward impulsively he
was touched strangely by the girls
grief more so than he would have im-
agined a girls crying could affect him
after so short an acquaintance

  here here he said warmly it
cant be that bad

  sharon started and jerked around in
the chair her face was white and tear-
stained her lower lip quivering oh
she gasped in a muffled little voice i
-i-

  kane went closer to her his face
looked young and rugged and yet very
kindly but there was a depth of feeling
in his expression that was not all pity

  if its none of my business he told
her just say so but-if i can help i
wish youd let me

charon cameron looked away
 and stood up she went over to
under the north pole



where a small packing bag lay open
for a long time she stared down at it
and then suddenly she turned and
burst out helplessly i dont know
whats the matter if i did perhaps i
could do something about it but-
she shrugged despairingly i do know
my uncle isnt here to drill for oil its
something a lot bigger than that

  kane grinned im glad theres
somebody else who thinks theres
something rotten in franklins terri-
tory i thought maybe it was nerves on
my part then more seriously he
asked tell me-just what do you
know about your uncles affair here
do you have any actual reason to fear
him or merely intuitions

  sharon glanced at the bag she had
been packing ive got enough intu-
itions at least to be ready to risk my
life getting away she said decidedly
ive stood all of this unofficial cap-
tive business i can just outside the
tunnel in the snow ive got enough
concentrated food tablets i stole from
the supply to last a month

  kane nodded slowly if i may use
such language of your kinfolk i think
henry cameroon is trying to pull the
well-known wool over our eyes

  you certainly may sharon came
back i never could understand his
wanting me to come here anyway
lately ive decided why he did it he
probably decided hed told me too
much abolit his affairs here and
wanted to keep me from telling any
more by staying down in civilization
he told me before that he was going to
victoria island and now he keeps test-
ing me to find out if i told anyone else
unfortunately i didnt

  for a minute kane looked thought-
fully at her just where are we any-
way he wanted to know at last

  dont you kndw the girl asked in
surprise w e  r e on-or under-
boothia peninsula

  boothia peninsula gasped the
scientist but that means-were
under the magnetic north pole

chapter iii
one hundred dead men

t know sharon shrugged but
j ifti sure i dont know what it
all means the whole things a
mystery to me

  kane was silent after a while he
said im thinking the only place we
can find the answer is in the part of the
cavern were not supposed to go into
which adds up to one thing-im going
in there right now and have a look for
myself

  oh you mustnt the girl cried
laying her hand on his arm her azure
eyes earnestly probed the depths of his
if he caught you there he might kill
you theres something-something
hes guarding with his life in there
just the same kane said finally
im convinced that its no less dan-
gerous to wait here than it would be to
go into the forbidden rooms but f
want your promise that you wont try
to escape before i get back then if
i find cameron is as crazy as i think he
is well go together

  with the girls promise still in his
ears he threaded his way to the other
section of the cavern in the glacial ice
he chose the narrowest and least used
halls to go by anxious to avoid cam-
eron or his assistants everywhere the
light seemed even and soft leading
kane to suspect some sort of phosphor-
escent material fused into the ice

  suddenly he rounded a narrow turn
and came into a hall about half as large
as the first the rounding ice walls
gleamed coldly about him in the spa-
cious room there was a battery of shin-


dynamic science stories

ing instrument panels down one wall
another wall lined with faintly hum-
ming machinery and a series of door-
ways on the other two walls

  kane shot a look about to make sure
he was alone then slid into the room
swiftly he went to the instruments he
found after a quick look that most of
them were unfamiliar to him consist-
ing of pressure gauges and tachom-
eters

  then down the wall he discovered
a frosted glass panel like a scanning
screen set flush with the ice wall at
the lower corner of it was a small red
button kane hesitated and then his
curiosity got the better of him his fin-
ger went out and pressed against the
button

  instantly the board lighted up kane
recognized it as a detailed geologists
map there were various colored
strata of ice earth oil and other for-
mations he bent closer his lips light
against his teeth as he studied it he
caught a breath

  the labels were frequent-and in
the brief words the young scientist read
something that made his heart hammer
and his pulses throb in his ears the
diagram was accurately scaled so that
he could read it easily about seven
miles down there was a thick layer la-
belled magnetic iron deposit
kanes eyes flashed on down to the oil
strata he found that the level of oil
in it was indicated by a movable black
line and that certain marks denoted
the level on other days by them he
read that in the last six months the oil
had been reduced from a depth of one
mile to about a hundred feet

  his mind raced he saw how thin
the layers were between oil and mag-
netic iron deposits and between oil
and the space below it-which seemed
to be merely a bottomless chasm all
at once kane stepped back and gasped
magnetic-why didnt i guess it

r the whole story was right there

	on the scanning screen if all of the
oil were drained from below the de-
posit of iron the slightest jar would
send the two-mile thick layer crashing
down far into the bowels of the earth
to come to rest perhaps twenty-five
miles below the surface and unless he
was very much wrong it was that layer
of magnetized iron that solved the age-
old riddle of why compasses point
north the great body of iron would
exert a tremendous attraction as far
south as the equator where some simi-
lar deposit must cause the southern
magnetic pole attraction

  abruptly george kane whirled
from the glowing screen and started
across the floor there was no time to
lose he must now find cameron and
the others and stop them somehow be-
fore their disastrous plan could take ef-
fect

  and then right in the middle of the
floor he jerked to a sudden stop he
stared down at the ice floor with an ex-
pression of utter horror on his drawn
features

  in the ice beneath he could see the
bodies of scores of men their fea-
tures were plain in the light suffusing
them pain desperation were frozen
into their countenances staring eyes
struck up at him in a way that froze
him with horror and wide open mouths
seemed about to shriek for help there
were at least a hundred men in the ice
most of them clutching pickaxes or
other tools all of them were eskimos

  before kane could recover from the
shock a footstep grated in back of him
someone said icily you find the bodies
interesting mr kane

  the anthropologist whirled cam-
eron he jerked and then in a flood
of anger so this is why you wanted
no one in here you wanted nobody to
see what became of the poor victims
whom you hired to build your ice palace
under the north pole



-and then buried in the ice by flooding
the chasm they were digging in

  camerons face was a stolid mask
the green eyes blazed under his shaggy
brows the only touch of emotion in his
countenance

  you are very discerning he
breathed

  yes-discerning enough to know
the insane scheme yon are trying to
work here kane scourged youre
planning to cause the great magnetic
iron deposit that youve discovered to
drop so deeply that it will be ineffectual
but why in gods name do you want to
do it cameron why should you want
to throw the compasses of the world
off to ruin the most valuable means
that man has of guiding him in difficult
places

  because the steel man grated i
intend to recoup my losses of the last
year and sustain an income no one can
ever take from me it has cost me a
fortune to recharge the metal i sold
but since then i have found why it
failed now im going to be paid back
ill be paid back for all eternity be-
cause while i am alive the worid will
have to pdy me to sustain a magnetic
pole and after i am gone-the world
will have to learn to go by the stars once
more

  their gyro compasses are useless in
most cases so they will be completely
helpless without me and all because
they dont realize a small amount of
heat will sustain the metal for years
a thousand degrees would charge it per-
manently but they wont know that
-because youll never live to tell it

  as the full import of the others
words struck him george kane sprang
forward and crashed against him both
men were carried onto the hard ice
floor kanes fists clubbed into the
others fafce as he sought to overpower
him he felt hard blows rock his head
with dizzying pain

in the next moment something hard

	shoved into the back of his neck
villers snarled one more trick and
ill fire

  the scientist relaxed and turned his
head to see the stocky assistants glow-
ering face close to his he got up slow-

ly-

  cameron got to his feet and faced
him angrily that will earn you a
more horrible end than i had planned
he gritted for the present you can re-
flect on a slow death in a block of ice-
with only a small hose leading to your
mouth to sustain life-until the ice
crushes you within a few hours you
will have the doubtful pleasure of ex-
periencing it but not before you see
something you can carry to your death
with you he gestured to villers
take him to the room

  without a chance to raise a hand in
his own behalf he was prodded out of
the room by his guard and led away
the room proved to be a small cu-
bical space in the floor with a huge
chunk of ice for a door to it kane wrs
rudely shoved into it and the door slid
back into place he saw at a glance
that there would be no escaping this
dungeon the walls were too slick for
him to ascend to the opening in de-
spaiv he watched through thick ice the
vague form of his jailer moving away

chapter iv
when the ice cracked

for two hours he was kept there
while he tortured himself with
worries and fears bitterly he re-
gretted his foolhardy attempt to dis-
arm cameron for it had changed his
position from that of a tolerated fool to
a condemned enemy the game had
been even more dangerous than he


dynamic science stories

thought one error had resulted in his
being thrown here in this freezing-cold
cubicle to await death

  and while he shivered here in the
semi-gloom cameron and his aides
were preparing virtually to enslave a
world whatever his plan was kane
knew it was almost at the culmination
point the others statement that he
would not die until he had seen some-
thing he could remember as he died
proved that

  and yet with a whole world about to
be plunged into slavery to henry cam-
eron the young scientist found himself
worrying far more about sharon than
he was about the worlds millions he
conjured up her face and her trim little
fur-clad figure before him and then
anxious fears would change the smiling
face to one of terror what did cam-
eron have in store for her he was too
suspicious a man to risk letting her tell
all she knew about his work some
stray bit of knowledge she had picked
up might give away his secret might
free men from the necessity of his pres-
ence in order to process the coil

  kanes mind rebelled at thinking of
what might happen to her he was far
more worried about the girl than he
was about himself he found during
those anxious hours in the dungeon
that she had come to mean a very great
deal to him

  after what seemed an eternity ca-
hill and villers returned and swung the
block of ice from the trapdoor they
lowered a rope to him and permitted
him to clamber out cahill stuck his
evil bony face close to his and rasped
weve got a special treat for you
kane cameron decided it would be
cruel to make you die alone hes go-
ing to let the girl go with you

  kanes heart swam in shock and ha-
tred he clenched his fists and bit out
savagely if ever a cowardly murder-
ous pack of rats lived-

  villers fat paw slapped across his
mouth cutting off the angry flood of
words save your energy to fight the
ice block when it begins to crush you
together they hauled him along
swiftly he was carried back to the
great hall in which the pump and coil
were stationed suddenly kane real-
ized that the pump was no longer throb-
bing he guessed the reason-that the
huge oil pocket was empty at last leav-
ing space for the mass of iron to tumble
into the bowels of the earth cameron
was standing near the coil by a black
box fixed in the wall sharon stood
near him a small frightened figure

  kane was shoved to her side im-
pulsively he reached out and grasped
her hand her answering squeeze
warmed his heart and gave him the
courage to smile his eyes promised
her hope that his lips could never have
uttered for there was only despair in
his heart

  now cameron strode before them
his face triumphant and cruel one
small thing remains to be done he
smiled and when i press that switch
it will be finished a charge of dyna-
mite now rests far down in our oil line
when i send it off the iron will drop
-forever	f

  kane watched his white face study-
ing the green eyes that burned coldly
im warning you he began that if
you go on-

  condemned men are in no position
to give warnings cameron snapped
in your position one usually pleads
but you two will not even have the sat-
isfaction of doing that for i am going
to finish my work before your very eyes
and then-then you will go to join those
eskimos you were admiring

  sharons eyes flashed to his what-
what does he mean she asked

   eorge kane guessed that she
   had not been told what was in
under the north pole



store for them he said nothing that
will concern us not if he goes on with
his plans at least cameron if you
werent half crazy with ego youd real-
ize what youre doing

  i realize fully the other chilled
i havent spent a year laboring in this
hole without knowing what i was
about he broke off and strode to the
black box on the wall just beyond the
huge green coil he raised his hand to
it he flashed a bleak smile at the two
men who stood at either side of the
captives their guns trained on them
slowly his fingers commenced pressing
the switch in

  kane lurched forward with a warn-
ing crowding his lips to be brought up
by his two guards you fool he
shouted youll bring this whole place
crashing down if you go on youll kill
yourself as well as the rest of us

  but henry camerons hand con-
tinued steadily to close the circuit that
would set off the charge of dynamite
miles below them his lips parted
briefly to counter your ravings are
useless kane i know enough of geol-
ogy to be sure that the ice layer is far
too thick to crack

  the hissing breathing of cahill was
sibilant in young kanes ears as the
bony aide hunched forward his
chalky white face was ghastly in its
drawn intensity making his eyes ap-
pear like hollow sockets at his other
side villers strained ahead his fleshy
lips pursed and then camerons body
stiffened as he drove the knife switch
home

  in the great cavern of ice not a sound
was heard there was a faint crackling
as the current was closed and then the
hall became as soundless as a cata-
comb for seconds the five who
waited hung motionless abruptly
through the solid floor of ice a faint
tremor was felt the gigantic coil quiv-
ered a little like a chiming spring that

has been struck then a low rumble
seemed to sound from walls and ceiling
and the floor quivered slightly

  over camerons face pale now
came a frown of puzzlement his hand
came slowly away from the switch box
his eyes sought those of the others but
his tight lips uttered no sound

  and then a wave of violent jerking
passed through the ice cavern from
the ceiling came a fine mist of ice chips
long lines of cleavage shot zig-zagging
through the floor under their feet as the
miles-deep ice cracked shrill raspings
filled the hall as age-old ice was ripped
apart

  the cavern in the ice was crashing
into ruins

  the tension broke cameron shouted
something and darted to the coil
braced his body against it as though to
stop its mad quivering cahill and vil-
lers ran to his side the three of them
like children who seek to hold back a
breaking dam threw their weight
against the tons of green steel that
shook and jerked

  kane turned to the girl who was
frozen with fear weve got to get out
of here he shouted over the thunder
of sliding ice but within him he held
no hope that they would ever climb
from the crushing death that was clos-
ing in on them

a cross the caverns floor a white
line shot tracing a path between
the man and girl and the three who
fought the coil down its length a great
chasm opened up ten feet wide kane
was left on the very edge of it staring
like a sleepwalker into the blue depths
that yawned before him his face
blanched as he gaped at the bottomless
wedge that slid down through miles of
ice then he whirled and grasped the
girls hand come on he cried
weve got to make the tunnel before
were cut off 


dynamic science stories

  he half dragged sharon with him as
he crossed towards the entrance but
even as they started ahead a deafening
roar sounded close behind them kane
spun about to see what new peril
threatened them his eyes widened as
he watched the scene across the chasm

  the coil had torn loose from its base
two miles below and with ominous ac-
celeration it was sinking down the ice
screamed as it ripped through cam-
eron and the others reeled back from
the jagged hole that had been torn by
the coil cracks shot through the ice
all about them as one man they turned
and ran back towards the others

  too late they saw the chasm between
them and the hope of safety but there
was no other way out for them now
already the ceiling was raining large
chunks of ice down on them and in a
few seconds the whole place would be
filled with jagged blocks of crushing
ice with a desperate leap henry cam-
eron launched himself over the gaping
canyon as one man the others flung
themselves at the opposite side

  kanes stomach felt cold and sick as
he saw them hurtle over the pit cam-
erons shoulders were hunched his
arms bent hands clawing as he stared
down at the death miles below sud-
denly his feet struck the other side
barely touching the edge he tried to
take a step twisted bent backwards as
the slick ice failed to give him footing
his hands clawed madly at the air as
his long body teetered back and then
in a moment he was gone

  from the cold depths a chilling
scream ricocheted up at them filling the
cavern with mad echoes before the
sounds died cahill and villers crashed
to their deaths behind him both men
were too frozen with fear to utter a
sound not a whisper came from the
dark void after the echoes of camer-
ons shriek faded away

  with a violent jerk george kane

shook off the cold fingers of horror that
clutched him he whirled and swept up
the girl in his arms and dashed for the
tunnel just as a thousand-pound block
of glacial ice crashed to the floor on the
spot where they had stood

  like a drunken man he stumbled and
reeled the floor heaved beneath him
threatening to throw him down the
slender pillars snapped like icicles a
rumbling sound gave evidence that the
oi machinery had dropped through the
floor kanes whole body was a tight
mass of bunched nerves he fought the
terror that would slow his legs down
and doom them to a horrible death

  the exit loomed up before him then
he sprung through and was dashing for
the iron ladder the walls were frosty
with spider-web lines that betrayed
their crumbling it seemed minutes
that he struggled towards the black hole
that would mean salvation though it
was only seconds his ears rang with
the rumbling thunder all about

  all at once the ladder was before
him he set the girl down and some-
how got her started up it swiftly he
followed the ladder seemed a thing
alive beneath his hands and feet
lurchings and shakings threatened to
dislodge both of them but fear gave
strength to their muscles and carried
them on

a fter an eternity of climbing the
trapdoor loomed before them and
sharons hands thrust it upward the
harsh arctic light streamed in on them
george kane followed her out into the
snow absently he noted the little pile
of provisions the girl had brought out
early that day

  the rumbling had almost stopped
now only faint undulations of the
ground evidenced the hell that had
taken place below kanes legs were
weak as he turned to the girl she was
crying softly with relief
under the north pole



  somehow the young scientists arms
stole about her shoulders and drew her
near him its all right now he mur-
mured the cave-in wont come any
farther it was just the ice that was
affected with the food you brought
out this morning we can get away from
this place and reach spence bay in two
days

  after a moment the girls voice muf-
fled because her face was buried in the
hollow of his shoulder and neck said
but what happened i thought he
said the ice couldnt slip

  it wouldnt have kane said ex-
cept that he forgot something-the fric-
tion that would be produced by all that
slipping iron the friction created tre-
mendous heat and melted the lower ice
that brought the whole place down
and when that happened-henry cam-
erons plans were spoiled he failed in
what he was attempting

  you mean- sharons face tipped
up to his querulously you mean the
pole hasnt been destroyed

  the original one was all right its
about twenty-five miles down now and
useless but cameron told me some-
thing before he imprisoned me he
told me hed discovered that all the
metal needs in order to have the mag-
netism fixed is to be heated up to about
a thousand degrees right now that
huge coil of his is slipping down and
heating itself far above that in other
words only a few hours will elapse be-
fore the magnetic north pole is restored
for good

  sharon was silent after a moment
kane said with the first smile that
had touched his face for hours per-
sonally i wouldnt mind standing like
this for the rest of my life but im
afraid wed freeze wed better start
for the settelment weve a long walk
ahead of us

ceaseless rain dripped from
the low-hanging clouds only to
rise again in wisps of steam as it
struck the gleaming sidewalks from
the fetid green venusian jungles that
encircled the town drifted brightly col-
ored spores like bits of confetti float-
ing lightly in the thick mist death to
anyone whose lungs they entered for
the spores feasted on human tissue
multiplying with frightful rapidity
they choked the lungs the blood stream
causing swift sure death

  jim weston standing under the
overhang of a grey crystalloid building
adjusted the spore-mask that covered

quick-rooting jetinis weeds sprouted
from between chinks in the sagging ma-
sonry forced apart the massive stones
of the docks a few crystalloid ware-
houses and grain elevators a wet scum-
covered administration building several
slatternly patched-plated tramps lying
like huge grey slugs in the slimy mud of
the landing field the only signs of life
about the space-port emanated in the
form of tawdry multiphone music from
a little cafe sandwiched between two
warehouses jim made his way toward
it pushed open the door stepped into
the cafes tiny spore-lock after a five
minute soaking in germicide-laden air

a space-trtp from venus to earth was what jim weston wanted - what he got was a
shanghaied trip on a mars-bound rocket as a member of saturnian slanes slave-erew and
when they crashed on mars red desert to be made captives of the torture-loving vens
this earth-man showed a saturnian bully that on any planet its guts not size that makes

the man

his mouth and nose eyed the opaque
fog with a disconsolate shake of his
head venus in all its doubtful glory
it made a man feel as though he had
been tossed into a giants cauldron of
stewing spinach jims hands touched
the heavy lead container strapped to his
belt twenty ounces of radium his pay
as chief engineer on the jovian aque-
duct job enough to take him to earth
a hundred times over    and he was
forced to stay in this steaming hell-hole
until a terrestial-bound ship made port
which might be months with the venu-
sian grain trade so slack of late two
years fighting mud gravity and meth-
ane gas on the oozy surface of jupiter
the maddeningly long jovian-venus
space trip and now the prospect of
months on this green hot-house planet
jim sighed dismally set out in the di-
rection of the space port perhaps the
captain of one of those rusty freighters
now unloading at the docks might be
persuaded to make this trip to
earth   

  the space port was a desolate sight

he slapped the dead spores from his
coat stepped through the inner en-
trance

  the tavern was worse jim thought
than even the dives of jupiter smoke
from a dozen strange narcotics dimmed
the light of the radite lamps the too-
sweet odor of venusian thole mingled
with the smell of martian tong and ter-
restrial whisky pallid overly made-up
women all but nude in their sheer cel-
losilk dresses sat hopefully at tables
sipping apparently endless glasses of
thole the men who lined the bar were
for the most part space-hands tiny red-
skinned martians squat jovians and
nondescript waifs from the asteroids
the moons of saturn jim stepped up
to the rail beckoned to the bartender

  where can i get information on
those freighters outside he demanded
i want to ship out of this green hell

  before the bartender could answer a
heavy hand fell upon jims shoulder

  ship out a deep voice boomed
youve come to the right place lad im
slane skipper of the astric as soon


dynamic science stories

as i can muster up a crew from among
these rats im leaving for mars

  jim glanced up at the owner of the
deep voice the man was huge nearly
seven feet tall and amazingly broad in
proportion his arms were long gor-
illa-like and the sweat-soaked shirt
clinging damply to his skin revealed
great rippling muscles that spoke of in-
human strength the giant was to
judge from his narrow reddish eyes
his absolutely hairless head a saturn-
ian his neck still bore the reddish chafe
of a svenson helmet most significant
of all his wrists were circled with wide
silvery scars scars that could only have
been made by the tightly welded fetters
of the saturnian prison colony clearly
the big mans past had been a check-
ered one

  well slanes coarse features
broke into an expansive grin out-
ward appearances dont hold for ships
nor men youll find the astric a tidy
craft and me a thoughtful skipper
come lad i need men to replace those
of my crew who were knocked off by
these blasted venusian spores youre
a bit scrawny  his gaze swept
jims slender wiry frame    but
beggars cant be choosers well sign
articles all fair and square and youll
get fifty thacls when we land on mars

tim eyed the man narrowly there

  was something in his tone a cunning
persuasiveness that did not ring quite
true

  mars he shook his head earths
my destination and i didnt figure on
working my way small difference be-
tween mars red-hot deserts and this
fever-ridden pest hole what ive been
dreaming of these three years is the cool
sweet fields of earth

  a passenger slanes red eyes be-
came mere slits that smacks of
money earths none too healthy for
me just now my little friend but per-

haps for a price    he picked up
his spore-mask from the bar turned to-
ward the door hardly a matter to
discuss in this thieves nest outside
on the decks well have privacy come
along

   jim hesitated reached for his mask
no harm in hearing the mans proposal
nodding he followed the saturnian
through the doorway

   the space port was still deserted dis-
mal in the steady rain some twenty
yards from the little tavern slane
paused

  well jims voicc was muffled by
the thin mask whats the proposi-
tion

   just    this slanes huge fist
lashed upward with paralyzing force
caught the earthman flush on the jaw
jim felt only the merest fraction of a
seconds pain before he lapsed into dark
unconsciousness

   the first thing that jim weston saw
on opening his eyes was a rusty rivet-
studded bulkhead all at once he real-
ized that he was lying on a rude bunk
that he was held there by some terrible
invisible force and then an explana-
tion surged through his cloudy brain
he was on a space ship pinned to his
bunk by the force of the vessels accel-
eration  jim lay back weakly tried to
piece together the puzzle

  it was perhaps ten minutes before
the ships speed became constant and
the force of acceleration slackened died
away jim was just struggling into a
sitting position when a door slammed
and slane entered the room

   still lolling in bed the giants
voice was harsh bah you earlh-
men are all weaklings up and get to
work he seized jims arm dragged
him from the bunk

  weston stood for a moment un-
steadily shook his head in an attempt
to clear it suddenly he noticed a heavy
lead container strapped to slanes belt
the stronger



a container marked with the initials j
w

  my radium he muttered you
   youve stolen   

  ugly word stolen the saturnian
laughed mockingly the radiums my
fee for taking you to mars of course
youll have to work with us short-
handed a months chipping rustll
make a man of you

  weston stared contemptuously at the
captain of the as trie

  yes he said coldly just what
id expect of you a stupid saturnian
bully with the brains of a  

  slanes hand open-palmed smashed
across jims lips sent him spinning
across the room

  maybe thatll showf you whos boss
on this ship he bellowed go for-
ward you lily-livered terrestrial scum
and report to the mate lively now
or ill break you like a matchstick

  he grinned hooking his thumbs over
his belt and shot a streamof blue lecl
in the direction of the sandbox legs
planted wide chin thrust forward bel-
ligerently he glared at the earthman

  im strong see he grated
stronger than you or any of these rats
aboard just remember that

  jim weston looked the big man over
broke into a sudden harsh laugh

  sure he murmured sure the
stronger   still laughing he
turned made his way forward

  the weeks that followed were a cruel
delirium to the members of the as tries
crew rotting food filthy quarters
long hours of toil    and slane
more than anything else the presence
of the captain tortured them here a
half-starved wretch pausing for a mo-
ment after hours of chipping in cramped
positions would hear sudden oaths feel
the saturnians thorium- soled boot
crash against his skinny cbest here an
emaciated oiler complaining to his
mates of the stinking food the lousy

dirt-encrusted bedding would find him-
self lifted by herculean arms shaken
until his teeth rattled and as whim-
pering they begged for mercy slane
wsuld taunt them call them cowards
weaklings only once had there been
a show of resistance to his brutality a
broad-shouldered jovian engineer
goaded into sudden fury had turned on
him brandishing a heavy slice-bar
ten minutes later the jovians mangled
body back broken arms dislocated had
been tossed from the air-lock and
slane deliberately bending the slice-bar
into a hoop walked scornfully from the
fo castle even in sleep the men feared
him muttering brokenly in nightmares
tossing restlessly about half-awake in
dread of his voice calling them to new
sadistically conceived labors like some
huge demon the captain roamed the
ship distributing his oaths his savage
blows with grim satisfaction

derhaps it was because he knew
a jim weston to be superior to him
mentally that slane singled the earth-
man out for special attention the dir-
tiest jobs the most killing toil fell to
jims lot and when slane discovered
that he could not catch weston resting
or grumbling his hatred of the earth-
man mounted determined to break
jim at all costs he devised new- and im-
possible tasks cleaning the carbon
from the forward rocket tubes the fir-
ing chambers shifting portions of the
cargo back and forth at the captains
fancy long hours in the near-zero cold
of the void clad only in a light space-
suit patching the plates of the astrics
hull a terrible ordeal yet somehow
jim stood it

   just how he kept going he was never
quite sure his hands were raw with
blisters his body bruised by slanes
well-directed kicks his every muscle
ached in weary protest there were
times when he felt that he must lie

down rest if it meant his death yet
always there was something that urged
him on some hidden source of energy
that was more of the mind than of the
body through sheer force of will he
kept on

  after what seemed an eternity of
grey days and nights mars appeared
below them huge red ominous its vast
stretches of desert laced by a network
of canals coasting in on a long slant
the as trie sped toward psidis   
called by earthmen acherusia palus
   at the junction of the bactrus and
acheron canals jim was polishing the
chromium of the control panel as the
ship raced toward the red planet slane
at the t-bar was grinning

  so he rumbled your cruise is al-
most over youll admit no doubt that
the comforts of our little luxury liner
have made up for the high cost of the
passage and if such a ragged scare-
crow as you should go to the martian
authorities with tales of robbery and
kidnapping theyd arrest you for
drunkenness besides theyll have the
word of honest captain slane that
youre space-crazy

  jim laughed that laughter how-
ever seemed to infuriate the saturnian
more than words

  by all space slane roared none
of your impudence  lashing out with
his huge fist he caught jim a glancing
blow on the jaw

  stunned weston staggered back-
wards crashed into the control panel
under his weight it buckled gave way
in a tangle of wires of shattered glass
blue sparks shot between short-cir-
cuited lead-ins under the fierce heat
delicate wires melted ran

  like a living thing the ship bucked
lurching crazily from side to side
climbing momentarily then falling
sickeningly slane his eyes bright with
fear twisted the t-bar desperately re-
ceiving no response he ran to the com-

panionway shouted along it

  emergency stations open forward
rockets full quick blast you lower
rockets full power

  jim weston disentangling himself
from the wreckage of the controls
peered out of the big glassite observa-
tion port psidis the canals were lost
in the distance the astric whirling
about madly was dropping like a plum-
met onto the red sandy desert jim
watched the ground leap up to meet
them one second two seconds three
seconds   

  suddenly the ship steadied herself as
the lower rockets burst into flame for
a moment it seemed that there might
yet be a chance the speed of the de-
scent however was too great with a
splintering crash the ship hurtled into
the hard-packed sand

  a lump  his head the size of an
egg jim weston clambered to his feet
a miracle it seemed that he still lived
the ship was a tangled twisted mass of
wreckage a confusion of bent beams
shattered plates and sputtering wires
the pilot room located on top of the
ship and well forward was the least
damaged jim touched his head ginger-
ly glanced about a smothered curse
from the other end of the room reached
his ears slane buried beneath a
heap of wreckage

  picking his way across the control
room jim tore at the scraps of metal
a moment later slane was staring up at
him helplessly

  trapped he muttered cant
move

  jim knelt beside the fallen giant
the massive t-bar assembly was
wedged across slanes chest pinning
him to the floor weston grinned
harshly

  if i was one of your kind he said
id go on about my business leave you
here might even kick you around a
bit before leaving
the stronger



  no slanes voice was a hoarse
whisper no lad you    you
cant

  no i cant jim said slowly im
not your type ill get a lever  

 i urning abruptly he descended
 the companionway to the deck be-
low the lower part of the ship was
smashed to flinders jim crawled over
and through a crumpled heap of metal
toward the engine room approaching
it he became suddenly nauseated the
room was a shambles a slaughterhouse
the other members of the crew caught
below at the moment of the crash had
been reduced to charred unrecognize-
able bits of flesh by a bursting firing
chamber snatching up a long durium
bar one of the compression plungers
he started back to the control room in
passing the remains of the storage com-
partments jim suddenly noticed that
the floor was wet frowning he dropped
the plunger followed the stream of wa-
ter through a maze of broken crockery
sacks of space-biscuits tins of meat
all at once he saw its source and his
heart sank the big water tank tilted
at a precarious angle was spouting wa-
ter from a crack in its lower side rum-
maging hastily among the debris jim
came up with two quart-sized metal
containers filled them by the time he
had found a third bottle however the
tank low after the long weeks in space
was empty with a shake of his head
jim picked up the two containers the
metal bar and made his way back to
the control room

  slane stirred at the sound of the
earthmans approach

  so he muttered youve come
back   

  yes there was irony in westons
voice he slipped the rod under the t-
bar assembly and using a bit of the
control panel for a fulcrum raised the
weight

    ah slane wriggled free stood up
 once more his domineering boastful
 self takes more than a wreck to kill
 a saturnian what of the others
 dead

   good riddance slane chuckled
 hoarsely weaklings they were but
 where are we

    jim motioned toward the observation
 port before them stretched an infinity
 of flat red desert baking beneath a hot
 yellow sky no hill no tree no sign
 of life broke the straight horizon rust-
 colored sand hard-packed clay   
 and nothing more

    not pretty is it slane mopped his
 egg-like head got any water its
 hottern mercury

    jim handed him one of the metal bot-
 tles

   be careful he warned the
 tanks empty only a quart apiece
 slane drank deep

   looks like we walk he grunted
 no chance of repairing the radio call-
 for help ill go below rustle up some
 food to take with us he turned to
 the companionway

   when he came back weston was
 making a rough attempt to shoot the
  sun noting down the results of his
 observation he turned to slane the
 big saturnian in addition to two pack-
 ages of concentrated food had the
 heavy radium container strapped to his
 belt jim grinned sardonically

    youll sweat he observed come
 on

chapter ii

 the sun beat down like a hammer
 of brass pounding the two men
 the endless stretches of waste-
 land on all sides there was nothing but
 the faint black line of the horizon an
 occasional cloud of flying sand swept


dynamic science stories

up from the plain by sudden fierce
gusts of hot wind barren desolate in-
terminable  a sight that tore re-
lentlessly at mens nerves

  jim weston his face and arms
burned to the color of raw liver his
eyes half blinded by the glare the wind-
blown sand plodded automatically for-
ward walking always walking two
days yet they seemed two centuries
that terrible ache in his legs that buzz-
in his head as though his brains were a-
boil and the sun the damned merci-
less sun he glanced at slane the
giant accustomed to the cold ice-floes
of saturn was reeling slightly as he
walked there was a nervous twitching
about his jaw and a wild glint in his
little red eyes

  how much further he gasped
licking his swollen cracked lips

  another day maybe two jim
laughed a hoarse cackle whats the
matter strong man turning soft
youre all alike you saturnians spoiled
by your great strength by always tak-
ing what you want by force but when
it comes to endurance to a fight against
something thats stronger than you are
youre not even close to us earthmen
were accustomed to struggling against
hopeless odds weve learned to use our
brains endurance comes from the
mind willpower courage guts   
the something that keeps you from ly-
ing down and quitting when the going
gets tough and bullies like you are
yellow whine when you begin to feel
pain

clanes head snapped up at these
 biting words as jim had hoped it
would and he increased his stride but
at the end of half an hour he com-
menced to reel drunkenly once more
sucking in the thin hot air with chok-
ing sobs all at once he slumped to
one knee gasping

  water cant go on without water

  jim paused eyed the shaking hulk
scornfully

  serves you right i warned you yes-
terday about swilling the entire bottle
ive nearly a pint of mine left

  a  a pint sudden despera-
tion shone in slanes eyes lunging
forward he bore weston to the ground
tore the water bottle from his pocket

  ah his sun-scorched fingers fum-
bled clumsily with the cap you see
whos boss now youll die and rot here
in the desert earthling and i   
ill   

  ive been waiting for this weston
leaned forward his sunken eyes gleam-
ing intently think a minute before
you drink slane do you know where
you are do you know which way the
bactrus lies aboard the as trie you
called yourself captain but i noticed
the mate did all the navigation all
right captain slane take the water
go ahead in an hour youll be walk-
ing in circles lost and in a day
maybe two youll be face down on the
sand begging your saturnian gods to
strike you dead you say youre the
boss well boss find your way out of
this

  slane hesitated his eyes on the blaz-
ing red expanse of desert in two days
he had seen no change nothing to vary
the awful monotony of the plain no
difference between the place where they
stood now and the places they had been
an hour before it was as though they
were on a treadmill walking walking
getting nowhere and the sun prodding
them with its hot copper beams and the
terrible loneliness and the mirages that
drew you from your path disappeared
as you ran toward them    water
splashed softly in the canteen as slanes
hand shook

  you    youre sure you know the
way he muttered

  my first job was working on the
martian canals jim wiped his
the stronger



gummed rheumy eyes we had a
chance  a slim chance of reaching
the bactrus now   

  slanes fingers tightened about the
canteen until they threatened to crush
it so weston knew the way out of this
fiery hell hed noticed the earthman
studying the stars measuring the shad-
ow of a little stick consulting his watch
he slane knew nothing of such mat-
ters in space robot pilots charted your
course noted your position but here
   all at once the saturnian dropped
the water bottle at jims feet turned
away

  come on he croaked

  jim picked up the bottle unscrewed
its cap filled the tiny cup with water

  here he said brusquely meant
to split it with you anyhow its going
to be a tough pull

  it was daylight faded into deep
blue-black night and the red desert be-
came a shadowy purple the fiery sun
gave way to the twin moons two gleam-
ing scimitars slashing the star-stud-
ded curtain of darkness refreshed by
the sudden coolness the spacemen plod-
ded forward weary robots dimly con-
scious of their own existence not un-
til midnight did they pause for a swal-
low of water then pushed on afraid to
rest lest they lack the strength to get
up to continue

  with dawn came the last mouthful
of water by noon slane was delirious
he complained of faces horrible sav-
age faces swelling until they filled the
entire desert then dwindling away to
grey nothingness babbling brokenly
he clutched jims arm frightened as a
child with a fever head bent eyes on
the eternal sand weston staggered on
hours passed now slane was mum-
bling of green trees flowers jim hung
tightly to the giants arm did not look
up the saturnian was going fast in
another hour theyd both be   

  suddenly slane began to shout to

call for help breaking free of wes-
tons grip he capered about awk-
wardly waved his arms jim glanced
up caught his breath

oacing toward them across the
a sun-swept wasteland was a cluster
of dark dots sharply outlined against
the rose-colored sand closer and
closer the moving figures came sweep-
ing across the plain with incredible
speed wiry dark-skinned little men
they were clad in flapping white dust-
robes mounted on shaggy-coated
thacns those ungainly stumpy-legged
beasts of burden which are found only
on the psidian deserts the nomads
made fantastic nightmare figures jim
weston watching them suddenly re-
called tales he had heard at the ter-
restrial club at mercis    tales of the
desert mens savagery of their fierce-
ness in combat haunting the ruins of
ancient cities they preyed upon trav-
ellers fighting fearlessly with anti-
quated heat guns purchased from ca-
nal-boat traders even the martian
alien legion composed of the tough-
est fighting men of every planet re-
spected the wild little nomads for their
reckless bravery jim remembered
snatches of half-forgotten conversa-
tions    how the desert men the
vens had once captured mighty mer-
cis sacked it    how their cruelty
had made them hated by all other mar-
tians    their curious customs their
strange language their inhuman lack
of emotion and now   

  you fool he turned to slane an-
grily dyou know who youve called
to for help the vens the aborigines
of mars tqrtures their main sport

  the saturnian stared at him stupidly
then turned his dull eyes to the desert
men once more they were near now
jim could see the dust thrown up by
the thatens hoofs the sunlight winking
on the vens polished heat guns the

desert men called to one another exult-
antly waved their webbed lizard-like
hands these membraneous fingers and
their green bulbous eyes were all that
remained to show that the vens had
once been amphibious part of the
mighty race that had ruled mars be-
fore the drying up of the great seas and
marshes jim gazed at them helplessly
no use in trying to fight   

  with fierce shouts the vens drew
rein forming a semi-circle about the
two spacemen jim felt nauseated by
the overpowering stench of the unclean
thaens for a long moment the desert
men studied them fingering the heavy
guns that hung from their embossed
woa-skin belts

  what    what do you suppose
they want slane muttered maybe
they got water   

  one of the vens his unblinking eyes
cold snapped a question in an unintelli-
gible dialect jims answer mumbled
in halting martian brought no re-
sponse suddenly at a command from
their leader two of the desert men
leaped to the ground extended gourd-
like bottles

  water slane tilted the gourd to
his lips drank avidly theyre
friendly gods of saturn  i feel alive
again ask em if  

  he got no further a dozen of the
little vens springing from their mounts
bore him to the ground for a brief
moment slane struggled bowling the
nomads over with sweeping blows of his
fists exhaustion however and lack of
water had taken their toll the big sat-
urnian disappeared under a squirming
savage mass of flesh weston leaping
forward to his aid felt scaly webbed
hands grip his arms his throat drag
him to the ground an instant later the
spacemen were securely bound lashed
hand and foot with stout rawhide
thongs grinning exultantly the no-
mads threw their captives over the

backs of two of the thaens sprang into
their saddles a word from their leader
and the vens were riding swiftly toward
the west

  neither jim nor slane remembered
much of that wild ride across the desert
dust from the thaens hoofs blinded
them and the jogging motion made
their tired muscles ache intermina-
ble hours went by the sun was just
sinking a bubble of blood on the dark
horizon when the troop of desert men
came to a halt dismounted

  the camp of the vens filled jim with
a species of awe the vast and hoary
antiquity of the place the solemn grand-
eur of the fallen columns the crumbling
walls were at once impressive and ter-
rifying even before the glory of the
canal-builders this place had flour-
ished a great desert shrine to some for-
gotten god among the ruins of the
outbuildings the vens had pitched their
black dome-shaped tents surrounding
the central structure a huge six-sided
pyramid its massive blocks of stone
in spite of their great age were firm
geometrically precise though worn and
pitted by the swirling wind-blown sand
about the base of the pyramid marched
half-obliterated bas-reliefs grey gran-
ite ghosts peering from the stone with
blind evil eyes wild distorted faces
misshapen bodies half beast half hu-
man worn by the sand to only faint
outlines at each of the six corners of
the building crouched a hideous winged
slug those legendary monsters which
according to the ancients once haunted
the lowlands of psidis

deside these majestic forbidding
- ruins the encampment was incon-
gruous ragged black tents flickering
camp fires slinking molats the tail-
less six-legged martian hounds   
a scene of squalor of primitive sav-
agery jim lying on the ground next to

and children emerge from the tents
gather about the warriors laughing
chattering admiring their bravery the
saturnians huge bulk seemed above all
to impress them they felt his muscles
examined his teeth as though he were
some strange animal the triumphant
warriors swaggering poured down cups
of tong bent over tiny braziers inhal-
ing the smoke of burnt jale

  all at once a barbaric beat of drums
issued from the great temple at sound
of it a sudden hush fell over the crowd
of vens the women and children cov-
ering their heads the men kneeling
from the ruined entrance of the pyra-
mid a baroque figure emerged blinking
his goggle eyes in the fading sunlight
tiny and withered he was and dressed
in brilliant feathered robes a tall
headdress bright with jewels precious
metals covered his hairless head hu-
man teeth hung in strings adorned his
neck his wrists a high priest jim de-
cided or perhaps a chief slane swore
straining at his bonds

  the priest glanced at the two cap-
tives grinning and spoke in a high
quavering voice instantly the two
spacemen were seized by a score of
small eager hands dragged into the
pyramid

   inside the great temple was dark ex-
cept where fallen roof stones admitted
shafts of light to jim it was all a
weird disjointed dream the green-
eyed scaly-skinned little vens the bi-
zarre evil figure of the high priest the
huge shadowy temple with its bloated
obscene statues its hideous bas-reliefs
beside him slane swore continually
more to keep his courage up than for
any other reason

  after perhaps ten minutes wander-
ing through long dank corridors they
found themselves in a vast hall a place
of sacrifice in bygone years to judge
from the big altar the grinning idols
before the altar were two cages tall

and narrow the sight of their tough
tiaeti-hide bars filled weston with de-
spair the heavy strips of leather
would bend certainly but even slanes
mighty strength could not break them
disconsolately he stumbled forward
was shoved bodily into the little cage
when slane had been forced into the
other pen the vens lashed the doors
into place

  muttering incoherently the wrinkled
priest approached the cages brandish-
ing a long curiously-carved ceremon-
ial spear with a quick movement he
cut his prisoners bonds thrust food
gourds of water between the bars

  good enough slane chuckled
kinda like being in the solar system
zoo back on earth but as long as we
eat and drink i dont care good food
this wolfing down the slabs of meat
the water he stretched lazily its
gonna be tough sleeping when you cant
even sit down but im tired enough to
sleep standing on my head

  leaning against the wall of the nar-
row cage slane closed his eyes as he
did so the grinning little priest lunged
forward jabbed his leg with the spear
weston watched his companion
straighten up with a bellow of pain and
his face went white

  good god he whispered they
   theyre not going to let us sleep

chapter iii

jim weston sagged against the
wall of the cage his face gleaming
with sweat he was fighting a
fierce inner battle against a weary body
that cried for sleep his eyelids it
seemed weighed a thousand tons only
by the most cruel efforts was he able to
keep them from drooping squatting
by the flickering altar fire the withered
priest eyed him expectantly his hand on


dynamic science stories

the ever-ready spear through a gap-
ing hole in the roof of the temple jim
could see the big green star that was
his home earth with its green fields
its great cities  here in the deserts of
mars it seemed only a dim dream   
a dream   he caught himself just in
time to keep from nodding off

  the priest however had not noticed
a howl of pain from the other cage told
that slane had dozed off again jim
turned to look at the saturnian slane
was shaking the bars in madness offer-
ing the container of radium for a min-
utes sleep vaguely amused the toed-
like ven wiped the blood from the point
of his spear jim glanced at slanes
legs they were gory clotted masses of
flesh marked by a hundred spear-
thrusts the giants face was waxy in
the firelight and his red eyes held an in-
sane glitter

  slane jim called youve got to
stay awake got to im trying to
work out a plan  

  plan slane laughed hoarsely
what can we hope to do why doesnt
he kill me    kill me before i go crazy
gods i could break a dozen of these
little devils with my bare hands but
this   

  show some guts the strength you
were always boasting about on the
astric try to act like an earthman
instead of a saturnian bully im going
to pretend to be asleep if i can hold
still while he jabs my legs make him go
higher ill be able to grab the spear
the carved handle of it is pointed
maybe   

  you cant slanes voice was a
whimper you cant stay still while he
twists that spear in your legs the
pain   

  weston shut his eyes lay back
against the wall of the cage chuckling
to himself the guard thrust at his legs
a trickle of blood ran down his calf but
jim did not move again the spear

flashed through the bars and again
the muscles of jims neck stood out
like whipcords the little ven nodded
real sport he decided was about to
commence the red blade of the wea-
pon rose higher cutting jims thighs
his waist and still the earthman did
not budge although his face was like
putty

  now the spearpoint was diging at the
tender flesh of his stomach westons
arm tensed its muscles tightened sud-
denly with the swiftness of a striking
molat his hand gripped the spear drew
it back for a crashing blow the pointed
butt of the weapon with all of westons
wiry strength behind it entered the
priests bulbous green eye pierced his
brain

  gods of saturn slane muttered
you   youve done it now if we
can get out of these cages  

  jim his face grey with pain drew the
spear back hacked the rawhide lashings
of the cage door a moment later he
and slane were running along the sha-
dowy corridors of the temple groping
their way toward the entrance

  quick the thaens jim gasped
the little devilsll be awake in a min-
ute

  already questioning shouts cries of
alarm were echoing through the en-
campment against the pale sand jim
could see the squat silhouettes of the
thaens tethered near the temple the
two men ran toward them unfastened
the tether ropes

  hold these weston extended two
bridles to slane ill stampede the
rest

epreed the frightened thaens gal-
 loped off into the desert the space-
men mounted the two remaining beasts
smacked them sharply on the flanks
dim figures ran toward them and heat
guns lashed the air with red beams of
light
the stronger



  the red desert the crumbling ruins
behind them were lurid in glare of the
heat guns a patch of sand beside
slanes mount fused ran jim marvel-
ling at the shaggy beasts speed glanced
at the stars

  slane he called keep going
fast were almost out of dan   
his words trailed off into nothingness

  slane glanced over his shoulder
weston lay sprawled on the ground
very still the thacn its leg seared
away by a heat guns blast rolled
about kicking up the sand in agony
slane shook his head no sense go-
ing back into that inferno of heat
rays for a man who was probably
dead besides he had the chest of ra-
dium and with weston out of the way
thered be no question of ownership
the saturnian grinned in a day or
two hed reach psidis and with a pocket
full of radium psidis with its tiny
rose-skinned girls its bottles of tong
of thole and he slane   

  the big man turned once more
glanced back weston lay still sur-
rounded by a blazing red fury of heat
blasts slane frowned somehow he
seemed to be back in the narrow raw-
hide cage listening to jims quiet voice
show some guts try to act like an
earthman instead of a saturnian
bully so the terrestrial thought he
was better stronger than a man of sat-
urn that he had more courage slane
wheeled the thacn about savagely

  bending low he spurred the fright-
ened beast back into the hell of lam-
bent flame pencils of crimson light
grazed his arms his legs searing them
it required all of his vast strength to
force the wild-eyed thaen forward now
all at once he was beside the limp
sprawling figure on the sand

  slane jim glanced up at him
smiling i    i knew youd come

  okay the saturnian muttered
gruffly leaping from the thaens back

he bent to pick up weston at that mo-
ment the thaen mad with fear from the
stabbing rays reared up on its hind
legs raced off across the desert

  slane the wounded man in his arms
gazed after the fleeing animal his face
beaded with sweat behind them the
heat guns had ceased abruptly the
vens seeing an opportunity of captur-
ing the two spacemen alive ran forward
across the desert shouting exultantly

  leave me jim sought to free him-
self from the giants grip run save
yourself

  slane shook his head stubbornly
staggered on with each moment his
pursuers drew nearer glancing over
his shoulder the saturnian could see
their green icy eyes gleaming lumin-
ously in the darkness hear their hoarse
eager voices now the desert men were
scarcely a hundred feet away their
webbed feet padding softly on the sand
weston slung over the big mans shoul-
der sighed hopelessly there was no
escape  in another minute at the
most two   

  and then it happened like a flam-
ing meteorite a sleek rocket plane
swooped down its proton guns hissing
caught by the deadly blast a score of
the vens crumpled lifeless to the
ground the others panic-stricken took
to their heels in wild insane terror the
plane landed lightly its durium runners
gliding softly over the sand

  the desert patrol jim watched
four men in the familiar green uniform
of the martian alien legion climb from
the plane thanks slane you   
you saved me   

  the giants deep laugh boomed tri-
umphantly across the desert

  better than a saturnian eh he
exclaimed less guts than an earth-
man huh like hell

  still laughing he dropped the chest
of radium into westons pocket and
staggered toward the rocket plane

   lets look back at today

    years from now no more may
 be known of today than we know of
 almost legendary troy buried less
 than half that long or of the toltec
 and pre-dynastic egyptian empires
 civilizations can not be reconstructed
 from archaeological data alone and
 books are one with dust after 
 years

   what then will they think of us in
 the great future that is to come not
 surely that each and every one of
 their scientific fiction-like wonders
 had its origin and factual basis in
 our today

   yet that is what we shall find in
 this first and subsequent roundabout
 views of the present while adven-
 turing in remote time to come

 punctually at five minutes to nine on
the nd of sol in the year  es
technician jonz entered the main lec-
ture hall of tellurian university and
in the only chair with which thte aud-
itorium was equipped seated himself
facing the vows of ground glass screens
that filled the huge room his entrance
having served as a signal to the engin-
eers in the balcony control room in a
moment the screens were glowing
brightly beneath the iridium number
plates that surrounded each immed-
iately the class began to assemble

 the young educational science tech-
nician his plain but not unattractive
features set in their characteristic ser-
ious mold composed himself to wait
while in their homes scattered across
the face of the globe the thousands of
his students bolted their breakfast tab-
lets to be before their televisors on the
stroke of the hour rapidly their life-
size images began to appear on the
numbered screens soon there were but
a score or two of screens still blank
then a dozen three one-and still one

   frowing the technician regarded

the uncompromising emptiness of the
ninteen - hundred - and - thirty - ninth
screen unprecedented twenty-three
seconds past the hour and-tiis frown
vanished as a girls face appeared with
startling abruptness on the screen

  the face as no  sat back trium-
phantly from suddenly mastering the
enigma of her televisors tuning dials
revealed itself as that which a forgotten
age might have called lovely giving
due heed to shadowed blue eyes and a
sweep of soft brown hair and pert tak-
ing into account an impish turn of lips
and a certain uptilt of nose young
e s technician jonz characterized it
rather as a harmonious combination of
plastic surfaces and yet he felt the
description somehow inadequate   

  collecting himself with a start the
technician took the amplifier from its
hook and placed it on his head it
rested there like the outlandish head-
pieces worn by the ancient kings be-
fore the age of frankness gleaming
points pressing into his scalp over the
principal brain centers without pre-
amble then he began his lecture and
a stir passed through the class visible
in the television screens as his brain
potentials led off by a maze of fine
wires that wound into a co-axial cable
and coiled across the floor to the trans-
formers in the control room carried
his first thought directly into the minds
of his far-flung students

  in opening the humanities section
of the rd session of the university
telepathcd e s technician jonz i
have but one preliminary observation
to make it is at the insistance of the
dean of students that two-way televi-
sion has been installed his belief is
that allowing everyone to see everyone
else- the technician gestured to the
silvered wall behind him mirroring to
each student the entire classroom-
will promote a valuable cooperative
spirit for my part  hope that the inno-
vation will not prove a distraction to
you in the serious pursuit of higher-


roundabout



  somehow e s technician jonz eyes
had strayed to a certain screen strange
how her eyes crinkled when-

  quickly changing the direction of
his thoughts lie resumed with a sharp-
ness that widened the girls smile the
next tiling we know they will be asking
us to come together in person and use
our voices- the technicians thoughts
waves were fairly surcharged with
emotional repulsion-like our more
violently insane or animals in pain
hmph so i sound like a sick cow
the intruding thought impinged
lightly upon technician jonz mind but
somehow he was certain it had origi-
nated with the girl in television screen
 instinctively feeling a challenge
he set out to meet it it is many thou-
sand years since man has forsaken brute
speech for mental communication un-
fortunately the devasting wars of the
third millenium left few traces of such
civilization as may have existed pre-
viously and true the absence of
graven records in conjunction with
archaelogical artifacts of considerable
engineering skill such as airships in-
dicates that man in the twentieth and
preceding centuries was but an illiter-
ate if gifted savage but he con-
cluded triumphantly all authorities
agree that it is at least ten thousand
years since the voice has been used in
communication between human be-
ings	h

  he darted a glance at no 
somewhat nettled to find her still smil-
ing in unreasonable amusement he con-
tinued swiftly it is our object in this
first lecture to obtain a true historical
perspective while man according to
the findings of anthropologists has ten-
anted the earth for about one million
years he remained a primitive creature
until less than  years ago  can
conceive no better illustration of this
fact than one involving the very matter
of mental communication already
touched upon

  the technician was on familiar
ground now his thoughts fairly
crackled it is true as i have informed
you that long before the twentieth
century telepathy had become mans
sole method of direct communication
but in how crude a form it prevailed
the proof is in an archaelogical dis-
covery in which i had the honor of

sharing while on the third brstd mid-
western expedition to the site of the
legendary city of tchaikago

  tchaikago-or chicago-if you re-
call the story was supposed to have
been utterly destroyed during the twen-
tieth century in a struggle between
fascism and democracy which accord-
ing to some were rival esoteric philos-
ophies of that time others would have
it that they are merely symbols of good
and evil characterizing the opposing
forces of capital and labor in the nine
hundred years war that pitiful strug-
gle between two archaic and artificially
differentiated groups using the power
of science towrest from each other the
bounty it could have given both in any
case digging at a new location we came
upon unmistakable signs of human
habitation it was there in the first
building unearthed that we made the
discovery-a tall narrow closet-like
wooden box on its door the nearly
obliterated cabalistic symbols publ
tel

  later excavations and subsequent
investigations convinced us of the na-
ture of this object it was an aid in
telepathic communication so men-
tally impotent were the ancients of this
day that they found it necessary to seal
themselves in these coffin-like boxes-
mind you that they had no ventilation
-until temperature pulse and respira-
tion were violently increased until per-
spiration exuded from every pore and a
condition of near-coma prevailed-and
only then were they able to communi-
cate with each other   

  may i offer a-an alternative ex-
planation

  there was no doubt this time that
the interjected thought had originated
with the girl visible in television screen
 though surprised the technician
indulgently consented

  the girl the screen showing her
leaning forward in the chair before her
televisor in whichever of a thousand
remote climes she might live earnestly
began what you discovered had noth-
ing to do with telepathy it was a
booth-a station-for using a mechan-
ical instrument called the telephone

   she hesitated yes we-they
used their voices to communicate then
but she quickly added they werent
-werent mentally impotent 


dynamic science stories

  the echo of his own thought escaped
e s technician jonz-by virtue of his
engrossment in a physiological phen-
omenon a disproportionate amount of
blood had come to the girls face as if
she were-lie sought and found the
archaic term-blushing meanwhile
the girl swiftly continued

  they were well on their way to it
however-telepathic communication i
mean extra sensory perception they
called it then psychologists in univer-
sities were studying it to see how it
worked and how it could be developed
other scientists were trying to find out
what it was

  they discovered that the brain is a
storehouse of electric energy released
in waves in thinking they were begin-
ning to identify certain brain poten-
tials with particular states of conscious-
ness and emotion and different wave
lengths with definite areas of the brain
and functions of the mind and in their
experiments they even put contrap-
tions on their subjects like the funny
thing on your head to carry the brain
potentials to transformers to be built
up so- the girl concluded with a toss
of her head that sent highlights rip-
pling down the sheer silic sleeveless
blouse that met trim silic shorts at an
even trimmer waist- i guess there
isnt anything now that the twentieth
century didnt well start

  e s technician jonz frown van-
ished with a sudden inspiration this
heyond doubt should prove a deadly
blow particularly to a feminine antag-
onist lie directed his inspired thought
to the class if there arc any tf you
inclined to agree -with the young lady
only regard her clothing like your
own it is of course the universal fab-
ric we call silic after the silica constit-
uent in the glass of which it is made
it is soft and lustrous yet it has a
greater tensile strength than steel it is
both waterproof and non-inflammable
compare silica with the straw-like fab-
rics which the ancients made from
course animal hair or the secretion of
insect larve

  he stopped abruptly feeling rather
well pleased with himself but it seemed
he had hardly finished his thought be-
fore the girl was replying thats not
fair they made synthetic fabrics-
rayon out of cellulose and artificial

silk by forcing collodion through fine
apertures just to begin and whats
more they made silic-even if they
didnt call it that

  e s technician jonz complacency
had been slowly dwindling now it
vanished completely his frown re-
appeared and with it a certain puzzle-
ment as the girl added  dont know
if the process was the same but ill bet
the results were every bit as good the
thread was made by breaking up glass
with steam under such terrific pressure
that a twelve ounce bottle would pro-
duce a single fiber five thousand miles in
length you might have seen it-i
mean one place where glass fabric and
clothing were made during the twen-
tieth century isnt-wasnt far from
chicago-owens illinois  

  a pedant technician jonz might have
been but not a fool beyond doubt
there was something strange about
this girl he had not failed to note a
certain confusion about time in her
mind alongside her remarkably de-
tailed if accurate knowledge of ancient
history moreover no archaelogical
excavation had ever been made at any
place called owens illinois

  this last fact he imparted to the class
sitting in his chair his true feelings hid-
den to any but the most intuitive ob-
server then added let us leave until
some later lecture the details of our
superior achievements and conclude
briefly with a more general comparison
between today and the twentieth cen-
tury i believe all will concede we have
made considerable social advances

  we escape all the crassness of that
former age the luirly burly of large
assemblages the psychic disturbances
of individual human contacts ours is
a more aesthetic life one that is con-
ductive to creative effort the power
of the cosmos floods into man on his
olympian heights and-was there a
hint of bitterness in the technicians
glance at screen -women is his
equal

  formerly people came together in
groups for diversion and in couples in
response to the animal mating instinct
for our diversion today we need not stir
from our homes the television screen
for example brings the theatre to us
or if i wish to relax over a game of
chess with one of my university col-
roundabout



leagues we play mentally as i am com-
municating with you as for perpetu-
ating the race for twenty centuries
synthesized ova and chemical fertiliz-
ation have replaced that compulsion on
men and women to seek out each other
sacrificing the splendid personal isola-
tion which is the superiority of our
social organization

  he concluded with a proud little-boy
defiance and suddenly seemed very
much alone as preparatory to dismis-
sing the class he rose to his feet in the
great hall of numbered glass screens
perhaps that is why the girl smiled
now more with her eyes grown lumi-
nous than her lips and perhaps that
is why she asked havent you for-
gotten that mating isnt all there is to
love theres companionship-
and arent you sharply inter-
rupted the technician merely ration-
alizing with some romantic nonsense
tliis obvious inferiority in the social
organization of the century you have
chosen to defend

  the gii l s smile drained away green
flecks seemed to appear in her eyes
oh allright then lets see if you can
take it too the twentieth century did
start chemical fertilization in fact
in the ninteenth century sea urchins
were produced that way later frogs
and rabbits and finally though they
were satisfied at the start to let it de-
velop only as far as the beginning of
cell division a human ova was fertilized
artificially

  the class telepathed e s tech-
nician jonz is dismissed and
snatched the amplifier from his head
until the television screens were blank
again he stood there though he may
have imagined it he thought he saw
contrition  the face of the girl in
screen  as her image disappeaued
on the fading glow then feeling a
vague unrest he strode out of the lec-
ture hall and left the university

  it was the same peculiar dissatisfac-
tion which made him proceed homeward
on foot from the corridor outside the
lecture ball he could have iwkcn the
pneumatic tube which burrowed be-
neath the city or the mono-gyro whose
spider-web tracks hung from every
tower no one ever walked but at
no other time would the emptiness of
the streets have struck e s technician

jonz as undesirable in a brown study
he trudged along until-

  hi professor

  later technician jonz would remem-
ber that it had happened exactly as he
came abreast public airport  dis-
trict  but at the moment there was
too much to which he had to adjust
himself her peculiar salutation it
meant notliing to him and yet it meant
everything for though he did not know
the words the intention was obviously
friendly and she had spoken-or had
that been the pealing of a bell

  i am extremely pleased to meet you
-miss  said technician jonz
and was so astounded to find that his
own voice had a not unpleasant timbre
-or perhaps was so engrossed wit h blue
eyes and smiling lips-that he said
nothing more for a moment then as if
announcing an amazing discovery i
had  idea you lived within a thou-
sand miles of here

  another disadvantage of television
telepathy-and isolation

  jonz smiled and immediately became
a much more attractive young man
perhaps you are right he agreed
amiably are you going my way
no

  it was a lie and technician jonz
knew it from the inrpish turn of her
lips but his capitulation was complete
then will you go my way he asked
yes she replied more softly
several squares later technician
jonz sighed and ventured to remark
that this was most pleasant

  then you were lonely the girl
said   and you do see dont you what
i meant by companionship its not
primitive its-

  yes but youre lonely too where
are you from

  the girl hesitated

  never mind technician jonz
said firmly he was a different man
now a man-as an earlier century
phrased it-with a maid at least
youre a stranger here so there is much
i can show you this afternoon the

whats that

magic in the air

dear sir

  last summer while driving through
arizona we saw a mirage which i
would like to have explained we saw
a broad lake ahead as we drove on it
never came closer but suddenly van-
ished and appeared behind us-l g
new york city

  it appears that this mirage involved
nothing more than a stratum of super-
heated air lying across the highway
shimmering so that at a distance it
seemed opaque from either side the air
itself gave the appearance of water
but ordinarily a mirage reflects or in
some way alters the image of some real
object in such cases armies are seen
marching through the air ants return-
ing to their sand-heaps are cattle scal-
ing a rocky cliff and a ship may divide
into two identical craft and sail away
in opposite directions

  reflected mirages occur when the su-
perimposition of two layers of air of un-
equal temperature and density causes
their common surface to act as a mirror
while the arizona mirage was un-
doubtedly startling - particularly to
anyone following the car which would
have seemed to plunge into the lake and
submerge-if it had been the reflected
variety the effect would have been still
more bewildering the lake itself
would have mirrored the surrounding

countryside

  the light rays thus reflected back to
earth may come from objects a few or a
hundred-even a thousand-miles dis-
tant thus peary in the arctic saw
mountain tops around the bend in the
earth the discovery sent another
expedition out to explore-the mirage

  of this same variety was the mirage
of armies marching through the air
seen in parts of the scandinavian penin-
sula during the franco-prussian war
even the uniforms of the men fighting
hundreds of miles to the south could be
distinguished most striking mirage of
this type observed recurrently in the
strait of messina and elsewhere in
southern europe is the famed fata
morgana-an image formed in the air
the water or in both with one inverted
of a harbour bustling with ships of ev-
ery flag even water-front houses and
streets thronged with sailors of many
nations

  while it may amuse us as has been
reported from lower new york har-
bour to see the empire state building
stand on its own head mirages
formed in the sky are of course not de-
ceiving but certain types of mirages
caused by irregular refraction of light
produce disconcerting effects while
it causes no harm to the beholder to see
a ship apparently split in two this same
lateral displacement of light forced one
aviator when two mountains suddenly
loomed before his plane to make a dis-
astrous choice between mirage and solid
rock

  similarly a mirage which distorts
size like that of the cattle which proved
to be ants magnified by the burning
desert air can be discomforting on
long island sound a huge ship sud-
denly loomed over a motor boat fran-
tically the small boat endeavored to
avoid being run down but the levia-
than its helmsman watching but not
seeing bore swiftly down on it colli-
sion was imminent when suddenly the
huge ship dwindled and receded to a
small cruiser miles away-as the mirage
ended

more moonshine

too technical for a layman to prove has
challenged me to offer convincing evi-
dence that light has motion will you
come to my aid-r e chicago 

  the simplest and yet a most effective
demonstration of the motion of light is
the original one used by roemer who
discovered the phenomenon while it is
true that most scientific demontrations
demand advanced technical knowledge
and elaborate equipment this one re-
quires only a watch and a pair of field
glasses

  on clear nights if the glasses are
turned on jupiter they will reveal the
planets four brightest moons whose
frequent eclipses can not be mistaken
the interval between successive eclipses
will be found to vary considerably in
observations made at different times of
the year that is because the distance
between earth and jupiter has changed
-the distance in bringing us the sight
which light must travel

  by this same method even the veloc-
ity of light can be determined with the
sole addition to our equipment of an
almanac taking the observations when
jupiter and earth are at opposition and
then at conjunction we find it takes
some sixteen minutes more for light to
cross the additional space between the
nearest and farther approaches of the
two planets that difference in distance
is also known it is of course the diame-
ter of the earths orbit approximately
 miles divide it by the ac-
tual  second interval our watch has
registered and we have for the speed of
light a figure slightly in excess of -
 miles per second

  in other respects jupiters moons
have long had a way of keeping in the
news these same four used in measur-
ing the speed of light served a far
greater end when discovered by galileo
in  they showed jupiter as a min-
iature solar system hanging in the sky
to all eyes they were a working model
of the copernican heliocentric sun-
center system-and a death blow to
the ptolemaic geocentric earth-center
system which had long impeded the
progress of astronomy

  not until  was jupiters fifth sat-
elite discovered but the decade after
 added four more to his growing
family these were photographic dis-

overies and it was thought that now
with the fifty short-period comets that
divide allegiance between jupiter and
the sun the roster was filled but a
few months ago the powerful mt wil-
son -inch telescope turned up two
new moons

  the discovery of jupiters tenth and
eleventh satelites is one to make us re-
member that the book of our knowledge
of our celestial neighbors is hardly be-
gun soon the great -inch califor-
nia telescope and then- what is the
mystery of the canals of dying
mars what lies beneath the shroud-
ing clouds of venus mature twin to
the earth in age size and physical
constitution

  and while we seek these answers a
young giant under the bright auspices
of eleven satelites perhaps awaits the
day when all the other planets shall
be dead barren-and jupiter shall be
the home of man

burning thoughts

dear sir

  is artificial fever treatment generally con-
sidered safet-m d b lubbock texas

  artificial fever induced by shortwave radi-
ation or incarceration in a hot box for from
two to ten hours has been used successfully in
the treatment of arthritis st vitus dance
and other pathologic conditions it is not
known whether the extreme heat-tempera-
tures up to  t are used-directly kills
germs or stimulates the body to produce sub-
stances that will but if delirium is avoided
by drinking large amounts of salt water to re-
place the salts lost in sweat no other ill effects
are suffered

  more interesting in its possibilities is an en-
tirely different use for induced high fevers
while they do not injure the brain they ap-
parently cause some change that increases
intelligence

  experiments with rats have clearly demon-
strated this fact while it is not known
whether the increased intelligence is due to
stimulated circulation sending more fresh
blood through the body and to the brain or is
due to some other factor there seems no rea-
son why this treatment should not be applied
to man
