by ernest haycox

chapter one

smiling fugitive

im reno riding along the bottom
of an arrovo heard the shot smash
out of the distance ahead and to the
right with that thin flat sound made
only by a rifle for a moment he
thought he was the target-the nat-
ural enough reaction of a man with a
price on his head-and his instant re-
sponse was to crowd his pony over
against the more abrupt side of the
arroyo and scan it both ways but

nothing appeared and no bullets dust-
dimple showed its telltale shape and
lifting his eyes to the bald bench he
had been paralleling all this afternoon
he found neither marksman nor ravel
of gun smoke thus alertly poised he
heard the gun speaking through the
sultry silence again

  that stirred him to action leaving
the saddle he crawled to the rim of
the arroyo and there saw the whole
story in one long survey a rider fled
up the undulating pitches of the bench
with every evidence of mad haste

leaving a banner of dust behind him-
the length of that banner showing ex-
actly which shallow depression he had
started from out in the open prairie
about a thousand yards behind him a
horse stood with dropped reins slight-
ly aside from the horse a mans body
turned over and over on the ground

  hit bad mused reno then be-
cause his experience with grief in its
multifold forms had taught him never
to forget his own safety he added
and if he dies here i am right on
the premises to be accused of doing
it looking back to the bench he
watched the ambusher at last wheel
about a dun-colored knob and vanish

  then he turned about and his eyes
sharp blue against the clean smooth-
ness of a bronze skin quested the back
trail as far as he could see which was
about three miles there was only emp-
tiness-good enough indication that
his recent maneuvering in the pocket-
ed country had thrown the posse tem-
porarily off scent he had he supposed
a three-hour lead and with that de-
cided he slid back to his pony and
rode out of the arroyo aiming for the
fallen one he shook his head with a
mild feeling of contempt for his own
weakness

  probably get shot for my pains
he observed posse behind fellow
with a rifle up on the bench and this
poor devil dyin out there-him no
doubt thinkin im the one that got
him

  he did then a characteristic thing
he grinned and the grin lightened the
assured and rather hard cast of his fea-
tures the pressed severity of his
mouth was released small weather
wrinkles deepened about the eyes and
at once a touch of ironic uncaring
recklessness lay revealed

  three hundred feet from the prone
figure he checked in straightening his
tall fiat torso the fellow had showed
some sign of life one hand reached
outward a dark and pointed face be-
came distinct

  easy called reno i didnt dry-
gulch you

  a surprisingly strong voice came
out of the man i know that come on
up

  reno crossed the interval and slip-
ped to the ground immediately feeling
a profound pity here was a young
magnificently set-up body long and
lean and powerful but it was shatter-
ed now beyond repair there wasnt
any hope-the man was going out
telltale sweat streaked the dark skin
and a grayish pallor mottled it now
and then one long leg lifted from a re-
flex of pain all that remained strongly
alive were the eyes the light that
came out of them was vital almost
fiercely intense

  take care of yourself said the
man look and see if-if hes still in
sight

  no he pulled out after the second
shot now old trapper weve got to do
something in a hurry ill lift you-
but the man shook his head a slow
andgrim gesture of defeat leave me
alone id fall to pieces

  youre sure of that asked reno
profoundly stirred

  he had seen men die before-often
enough in fact to have developed that
deep and quiet sense of fatalism that
colored all his thoughts and sometimes
made him seem callous to suffering
but here was a man dying as a man
ought to die-without fear and with-
out crying the bright black glance
was actually defiant it was sad to see
such fine courage wasted


all western

  youre a stranger grunted the
man

  yes anything i can do

  if youre no fool youll never stop
till this cursed country is behind you
said the man with a heavy bitterness

  you know who got you asked
reno

  i know said the other but he
pressed his lips together and reno un-
derstood that the name of the killer
would never come out on impulse
reno rose and got his canteen and
tipped it to the mans lips afterwards
he took off his hat and shaded the up-
staring face

  bound anywhere in particular
asked the fellow

  if you want a message delivered
said reno ill carry it

  the fellows eyes closed he said
rapidly go to morgantown and find
big lafe mcmurtree tell him tell
him two-bits is dead tell him-it was
a rifle shot

  that all asked reno

  take my gun with you give it to
him

  nothing else pressed reno no
infonnation as to who did it

  if you tell him exactly what i told
you the man said faintly hell
know

  renos deep sympathy moved him to
say something then that he never
would have said to another person

  when you cross ihe jordan ferry
my friend the valley beyond will be
green with grass and freshly watered
itll be a pleasant place to camp is
there no woman youll want to send a
word to

  me muttered the other a mc-
murtree what woman cares for that
black tribe theres only one in all the
hills to grieve she shouldnt for weve

hurt her ever since she was a kid but
shell think kindly of me long after the
rest have forgotten

  open your mouth said reno tip-
ping the canteen

  but there was no obeying gesture
and reno looking down with a close
curiosity saw the others lids slowly
relax and creep partially open he
knew then even before he laid his
hand across that broad chest what the
answer was-the fellow had drifted on

  rising slowly reno replaced the
canteen and reached for his cigarette
tobacco along his lean jaws appeared
a sudden tightness and the rest of his
features took sharper and harder form
-the unconscious reaction of a man
who hated injustice for at twenty-
five with the rather bitter and rough-
and-tumble experiences of his life to
draw from he still possessed the in-
stinctive fighters sense of fairness

  another good hand ridin into the
sunset too soon he muttered

  lifting his eyes then he saw that
the day was drawing to a close and it
reminded him of the fact that he was
losing good minutes he could do noth-
ing more here his position was dan-
gerous his promise to the dead man
laid him wide open to further uncer-
tainty nor could he undertake to
move the fellow to the nearest town
that chore he realized would be done
by the posse now undoubtedly-closing
up what he had to do in short order
was to put the miles behind and to
watch with an increasing vigilance

  reaching down he got the other
mans gun-a forty-five with a worn
grip that had a star-and-crescent inlay
of mother-of-pearl-and stowed it in a
saddlebag then he swung up and
lined out to the westward at a strong
canter another rear glance
the feudists



  but he reflected soberly this whole
business is bad for me im a stranger
and im mixed up in something that
probably has a lot of strings tied to it
this range is different from no other
whoever wanted that fellow dead will
move a lot of dirt to put the job on me
i can expect to be challenged any time

  when the sun fell beneath the earth
he was a good eight miles off in the
depths of a land that ran west and
south without visible break-a free
and open range pleasant to the riders
eye to the north the tawny bench still
paralleled him increasing in rugged-
ness and backed up by a considerable
range of hills that swung forward
from the distance just as dusk fell he
looked behind again and thought he
made out the posse far off then dark-
ness came with a rush and he laid the
sandy mites beneath him one by one

  by degrees the bench began to curve
away and he followed along that bend
with the general belief that the town
he sought which was blackrock stood
somewhere ahead with one face show-
ing to the prairie and the other con-
fronting the hills around the bend he
saw it in the shape of twinkling lights
all aglimmer across the flats and
about eight oclock he entered the nar-
row central street of this range settle-
ment

  a double row of locust trees ran the
length of the street deepening the
shadowy and accenting the warmth of
those lamplight lanes gushing out of
the buildings a saloon blazed brilliant-
ly near by men walked indolently be-
neath the porch roofs there was the
sound of guitar and fiddle somewhere
coming upon a water trough jim
reno let his pony drink sparingly
then rode into the adjacent stables
runway when he dismounted a hos-

tler advanced from the darkness

  grain him said reno but keep
the saddle on him

  the hostlers face came closer thin
and inquisitive keep the saddle on
he said

  yes replied reno shortly and
turned away

  he knew that so simple an order ex-
posed his hand and he knew too that
the news would spread all these
towns were alike alert and suspicious
weighing strangers in the light of
factional politics such deliberate plans
as he had laid were worthless now
made so by the death of that rider on
the prairie and he could only guide
himself from one uncertain situation
to another understanding this he
strolled into a restaurant and ordered
a meal

  only thing im stire of he reflected
over his eggs and bacon is that nobody
will recognize me

  afterward he went back to the
street fashioning a cigarette in the
shadows half a dozen townsmen sat
on the porch steps to his immediate
right and talked in drawling syllables
the casual strollers drifted in and out
of the saloon across the way but as
he paused in his tracks debating with
himself he noticed one man walk from
that saloon with an air of purpose and
come across he passed reno at arms
distance not seeing him and went
straight to the stable there turning in
it meant nothing it meant anything
reno held his place on guard a little
later the man emerged from the stable
and strode back to the saloon

  thought so said reno to himself
and dragged a deep draught of smoke
into his lungs he had wondered about
making his appearance in the saloon
but he realized now that it was a nec-


all western

essary step somebody was showing a
curiosity which he himself had to sat-
isfy

  fve got he reflected about one hour
posse will be here then

 he went over and shouldered
through the swinging doors at the
bar across the rear he ordered his
whisky and dawdling against the ma-
hogany studied the place through the
mirror behind it

  it was comfortably filled this room
smoke hung thickly from the ceiling
like ropes of moss and riders tramped
around with the leisurely restlessness
that rises from a full stomach and a
free night a half-dozen poker tables
were in full play two floormen moved
swiftly through the crowd and some-
body called rather sharply three
sevens will take this pot reno drank
and laid his glass down

  stranger asked the barkeep look-
ing closely at reno

  never saw me before countered
reno

  no-o

  must be a stranger then said
reno eyes going back to the mirror

  he saw something interesting re-
flected from a far corner of the room
over there three men stood against a
wall and looked at him with more than
a casual attention one of these-tall
and broad and beyond the middle of
life-bent his head and spoke briefly
to the fellow at his left hand that was
all the trio split and the addressed
party strolled from the place reno
paid his bill thoughtfully and turned
out past the doors he sidestepped to
get away from the light and went on
down the walk 

  he drew up with a swift defensive
motion a slim figure drifted away
from a dark wall wheeled across his

path and spoke with a softness and a
casualness infinitely deceptive

  no offense but theres somebody as
wants to talk to you

  i dont know anybody here par-
ried reno

  would that make any difference
asked the other

  if he wanted to talk to me bad
enough i guess not admitted reno

  thats it said the other gently

  but reno was exploring his chances
and so he went on im not on any-
bodys pay roll why should i take
orders

  this man answered the other is
accustomed to havin his way and
then a touch of cold insistence came
into the words anyhow your horse
probably wont be ready for you short
of another ten fifteen minutes

  i wondered about that remarked
reno all right lead the way

chapter two
the messenger

he man turned and
p- went into an alley be-
side the saloon trail-
ing through this utter
gloom reno swung
around a corner and
stumbled through the
clutter of boxes and
broken things the man halted tapped
lightly on a door and opened it go
ahead he said and reno stepped into
a room that was he immediately rec-
ognized directly behind the bar all
the sound of the crowd came through
in muted proportions the messenger
closed the door

  there were three men-the messen-
ger the tall and heavy fellow reno
had noticed before and another whose


the feudists



square bold inordinately hard face
gave an impression of brusque cruelty
reno knew the types of men who rode
the prairie and his weighting glance
told him all he wished to know about
this particular one straight or crook-
ed the fellow was a driver and a killer
he weighed around two hundred
pounds and his hips and legs were
powerful after the fashion of a bronc
buster his torso went thin at the
flanks and broadened again at the
shoulders he had long arms the
hands of which were oddly tapered
and supple-good hands for a gun
reno instantly thought but it was the
face that dominated renos attention-
that harsh- dark face with the pressed
mouth the flattened cheekbones and
the drilling blinkless eyes as black as
the jet-black hair showing beneath the
mans hat

  all this he gathered at a glance but
he had been long enough at it to draw
a dry comment from the older man in
the room who said shortly youre
lookin at my foreman hale wolfert
reno swung his glance over to the
speaker he was a big man with a
small nut-shaped head which bore sly
and sharp yankee features his hair
was white and he was perhaps better
than fifty reno asked a sudden ques-
tion then who are you

  pete vilas said the man after a
moment he added i own some of the
prairie

  what of it challenged reno
vilas chuckled and looked at his
foreman comes to the point dont
he hale

  but wolfert neither answered nor
moved his eyes clung steadily to
reno and a scowling disfavor appear-
ed to collect in them

  vilas spoke abruptly to the third

man the one who had brought reno
to this room thats all george
george slipped quietly through the
door vilas went on you were prob-
ably on your way straight through
blackrock werent you

  what makes you think so asked
reno

 left your horse saddled in the
stable

 i wondered who was interested
enough to go look observed reno

  vilas expelled that humorless frag-
ment of a chuckle again youre a
sharp boy any name

 reno-jim reno

  it will do as good as any said vilas
 shrewdly now reno i need a favor
 done i was thinking youd do it
 why

  because said vilas pointedly i
can do you one

 maybe maybe not was renos
noncommittal answer

  oh yes i can keep you from falling
into the hands of the sheriff is that a
good guess or aint it

  whats the favor you need par-
ried reno

  i want a message delivered noth-
ing more

  hale wolfert suddenly came out of
his long silence i dont think you
better use him pete

  why not demanded vilas

  i just dont believe you better
  know anything about him

  no said wolfert

  then whats your objection

  hale wolfert said emotionlessly i
dont like the looks of him

  quiet came to the room and reno
stood there with the full force of both
mens eyes beating on him vilass lit-
tle head came forward and his sly
face became deeply thoughtful but he


all western

 said finally i can judge a man as well
 as you hale hell do its no odds any-
 way

  wolfert shrugged his shoulders and
vilas turned to reno again how
about it

  i see the point drawled reno
all right what message and where
to	

  do you know anything about this
country asked vilas

  reno was still a moment then said
no with a certain touch of reserve
it brought from wolfert a more re-
lentless saturnine attention and vilas
seemed to check his heady talk but
after a while he nodded and spoke
again

  well its no country for invalids
reno i wouldnt send you out and not
tell you that up in those black hills is
a crowd of men that hate the sight of
the prairie and everything that walks
on the prairie theres a little joint up
there called morgantown seventeen
miles away in the last ten years i
dont recall a morgantown man ever
coming to blackrock as for the other
way around a blackrock man couldnt
get to morgantown if he wanted
thats where i want you to take the
message

  a long silence fell across the room
reno studied the other

  so he said at last im the suck-
er

  i was waiting for that admitted
vilas with a show of candidness but
im not playin you for a sucker its
an out-and-out proposition youre not
takin anybodys place and youre not
inheritin anything i cant get a black-
rock man up there without havin him
shot off the road youre a stranger
youll make it

  whos this message to

  i want you to go find big lafe mc-
murtree said vilas slowly

  jim reno looked down at the table
and ran his hand idly across it howll
i find him

  there was no immediate answer and
when he raised his head he saw vilas
staring at wolfert with an air of sup-
pressed ironic amusement

  well said vilas youll have no
trouble about that hell find you con-
sider that settled

  whats the message

  for reply vilas turned to the desk
and pulled up a chair he got out a
pencil and a piece of paper and for
some moments his raw-boned fist la-
bored across the paper when he had
finished he handed the result over to
reno

  nothing secret about it look at it
for yourself

  reno read

mcmurtree

  the cattlemen of cross jack range
consider that the long war between
hill and prairie has gone far enough
we will countenance no more raids on
our beef speaking for myself if this
goes on any longer i will bring a full
party to morgantown and bum it sug-
gest you arrange a meeting with me
to settle this sunday i am willing to
ride anywhere along the base of drum
peak to talk it out with you

p vilas

  ill make no friends up there bring-
ing this observed reno

  theres always some small danger
in everything admitted vilas i
didnt say this was shy of trouble
supposin i say no

  vilas leaned back and met renos
glance squarely you dont want to
meet the sheriff do you

  thought that was the proper an-
the feudists



swer said reno but i wanted to get
it straight all right am i supposed to
bring back an answer

  answer asked vilas as if he had
never thought of it well now well
if theres such a tiling as an answer
bring it back

  all right decided reno and put
the note in his pocket

  the morgantown-blackrock road
runs due north of the stable said
vilas get on your way ill see the
sheriff but i dont want him to find
you in town

  reno turned to the back doorway
and had his hand on the knob when
hale wolfert said curtly wait a min-
ute you and when he wheeled about
he found the foreman looking atvilas
with a stubborn displeasure

  pete said wolfert think this
over before you let him go i dont like
his looks if he gums up the works
where will we be

  vilas rose from the table what
works will he gum up hale he asked
smoothly the proposition is plain
and aboveboard aint it

  wolfert muttered a sound of dis-
gust pivoted on his heels and passed
through the inner door to the barroom
reno let himself out the back way
without further delay walked up the
nearest alley and then pressing along
the walk to an area where locust and
porch created a profound pool of black-
ness started to cross over to the stable

  ie never took a step into the road-
way poised on the edge of the boards
he heard the cantering hoofs of a con-
siderable party coming out of the
prairie he stepped back flattening
against the building wall from that
position he saw a dozen riders come
down the street double file as the first
building lights touched them he rec-

ognized the sheriffs party

  with all the assurance given him by
pete vilas he felt no ease his atten-
tion began to turn toward one point of
escape and another meanwhile the
sheriffs party passed and nosed in at
the hitch rack looking that way he
saw hale wolfert come through the
glare of the saloon doors step aside
from the oncoming posse members
and go rapidly across the street some-
thing about that maneuver further
warned reno to sudden action and ac-
cordingly he walked straight over to
the stable and into it the hostler stood
in the runway barring his path

  im going out said reno abruptly
reaching for his money wheres the
pony

  the hostlers answer was reluctant
defensive ive had orders

 sure well thats over with
wheres the horse

  i aint had any contrary order in-
sisted the hostler

  renos reply was to reach out seize
the man by the shoulders and spin
him around

  this is not your fight brother and
it will do you no good to get your head
busted in it wheres that horse
left-hand end stall grumbled the
man

 reno went past him on the run
reached the stall and turned into it
he was in the saddle and swinging
through the rear doorway when the
hostler cried out angrily

  i hope you get your liver blasted
out you-

  it was the talk of an angered man
yet reno cool and taut heard in it
the suggestion of something about to
happen-something the hostler knew
it prompted him to bend far over
against the saddle as he went out the


all western

rear way across the baked corral area
and through a wide gate

  somebody rose up on his right he
saw the shape rearing against the
nights lesser black and as he saw it
he slashed the pony with his spurs and
reached his hand toward his holster
the blackness was etched with a sharp
streak of light and a deep roar swelled
the night marking that point reno
let go with his shots throwing them
down recklessly as he sped away into
the open there was one more reply
and then a silence

  over behind the row of buildings in
the street men began shouting but
the sound soon faded as reno cleared
blackrock struck the ruts of a north-
ward road and faded down it fie was
he knew in the clear there would be
no pursuit the ambusher was alone
and could not afford to follow a mile
onward he lessened the gait and re-
laxed

  didnt hit him he said to himself
but he fell to keep from bein hit
wolfert no doubt about it he knows
something about me vilas didnt yet
it dont seem possible he could have
recognized me

  overhead the velvet of the sky was
set with diamond points of starlight
in front of him the bench and the
range behind it made a seeming bar-
rier the ground began rising beneath
him and a sharper air poured across
the slopes sitting easy he aimed for
morgantown seventeen miles away

  nothing vilas said about this mes-
sage fooled me he pondered the
words of it mean something else the
whole thing is aimed for another pur-
pose but it ivill serve my purpose bet-
ter than if i planned it deliberately
im back thats the main thing-im
back to do what is left to be done

          chapter three
          the deep hills

here was something
deceptive about the
rugged country into
which he traveled it
seemed to bury him
in its depths yet more
than two miles out of
blackrock the first
quick tilt of the bench lifted him to a
crest from which he saw again the
lights of the town after that the road
tackled earnestly an increasing grade
and for long intervals renos pony
went on at a slogging walk a bank of
fog drifted thickly about him beyond
that level he was in the pure darkness
of tree country and all around him
lay a profound stillness and mystery

  he realized he had put the bench
definitely behind him this now was
the scarp of that distant range he had
seen during the day

 he went on for better than two
hours through the windings of this
gorge until its walls began to spread
farther apart shortly afterward he
passed what was apparently another
trail running due south along a minor
crest of the hills not knowing which
was the proper way to morgantown
he paused briefly to study it out and
then pressed on with the assumption
that the straight course was the like-
liest but he had not gone far when he
was warned that the trail had other
riders

  the warning came abrupt and clear
from the hind quarter in the shape of
ponies feet striking fast and hard on
the trail he had only time enough to
crowd his own mount against a side
wall of the gorge when they came
beating up and by crouched there in
the feudists



the saddle an arm reached across the
animals nostrils he made out one
rearing shadow after another passing
forward into the gloom quick dust
rolled out and touched him and then
the noise of their travel died in the
distance ahead

  twelve or fifteen of them he said
half aloud and they came out of that
side trail busier than irritated bees
turning the meaning of it over and
over in his cool mind he added only
a few kinds of business rate that sweat
and grunting by dark this is the sort
of country i thought it might be

  at twenty-five reno was well aware
of the fact that any land of night rid-
ers would be a land of subterfuge
this was what he had pushed into-
subterfuge and uncertainty to the
point of considerable danger as for
himself he could play it cautious or he
could play it reckless but the one nec-
essary thing was to tie himself by one
means or another into the life of these
hills he could accomplish no part of
his own plan as long as he remained
an outlander

  so he mused i better play it slightly
reckless seevis the surest way slight-
ly reckless-and continue the sucker
role till it peters out nobody will rec-
ognize me

  the gorge spread all at once into a
small valley and as reno went down
the curving grade he was again bathed
by a fog thick enough to be stirred by
his passage this added to the dark
made a blinding element and he could
only let the horse choose its route
long afterward-he judged it to be
another two miles-he felt the road
rise from the distance a rumbling
sound began to lift and reverberate
through the night presently he got
above the fog and caught the faintly

etched outline of trees against the
black sky but the road sheered away
and went directly toward the rush and
mutter of a waterfall he thought he
saw the twinkle of a light ahead but
it vanished swiftly then the hoofs of
his horse suddenly woke loud drum-
ming echoes as the animal crossed a
plank bridge

  hold up

  he checked the horse to a slow drift-
ing and said casually all right
who is it said the voice

  the name is reno-jim reno
  where from

  blackrock

  a little silence ensued broken final-
ly by a throaty oath

either youre lyin or youve got
the nerve of a brass monkey and
where do you figure youre goin at
this hour of the night
morgantown said reno calmly

  he heard then the stir of other men
coming afoot from the background
the challenging voice was still but a
murmur of talk rose to the rear a gun
hammer clicked the voice resumed
cynically

  and i reckon youre just out to get
a breath of air-nothin more

  no said reno crisply ive got
business up here use your head what
in hell else do you suppose would be
bringin me into the hills after night-
fall

  light that lantern called the
voice and lets get a look at this free-
spoken customer

  those other men seemed to be wait-
ing for the order a match blazed in-
stantly and a lanterns chimney drop-
ped over a clear yellow flame that cut
sharp arcs in the dark it came bob-
bing on and lifted in front of reno
looking down at the men behind that


all western

lantern reno saw a face that remind-
ed him oddly of somebody else-a long
and slanting and heavy-featured face
the voice of the spokesman who still
remained beyond renos view rose
resonantly

  i dont know you whats your busi-
ness up here

  ive got a couple of messages for
big lafe mcmurtree you boys know
him

  dont you know him parried the
other

  no said reno

  then shot back the spokesman
with an increase of temper youre no
blackrock hand better not lie

  i didnt say i was a blackrock
hand returned reno i said i came
from there

  whats the size of these messages
demanded the spokesman

  that happens to be none of your
business stated reno with an even
severity

  might be some questions as to
that grunted the spokesman

  but a milder voice came up from the
rear we better take him in the-
dore

  let me handle this said the
spokesman in no pleasant manner

  then handle it and quit talkin
retorted the mild one

  all right growled the spokesman
well take him to big lafes

  at a command reno moved forward
with the lantern bearer trudging be-
side him a horseman came suddenly
abreast on the other side and showed
one knife-scarred cheek in the light
it was reno realized the fellow who
had done all the talking roan-colored
hair showed along the mans temple
and his eyes had a mongol narrowness
to them nothing more was said the

lantern bearer abruptly extinguished
his light and went off presently the
rest of the unseen group came milling
into the road now asaddle and thus
escorted reno trotted past a dense
point of timber and on toward a beam
of light glimmering from a house
window

  the cavalcade ignored it and turned
into a lesser and more abysmally sight-
less route it shot upward precipitous-
ly high into a windier world some-
where the group turned again and
went single file along the barren spine
of a ridge twenty minutes later the
course fell down the side of a canyon
where a small creek went rioting be-
tween jagged walls reno trying to es-
tablish the windings of this trail in his
mind finally gave up with the feeling
that the leader of the party was delib-
erately complicating the thing the
feeling became certainty when they
shifted up another stiff slope and came
to a momentary halt

  one rider trotted on for a way spoke
a subdued phrase and called back all
right the party moved ahead and
within a quarter mile came upon a
clearing at the far end sat a house all
aglow

  a pack of hounds charged forward
in full throat swirling about the feet
of the horses at the porch a pair of
men stepped from the shadows and
stood silently alert the spokesman
murmured something indistinct do
them and pointed at reno who got
out of the saddle and walked forward
at the same time a door swung open
urged by the spokesmans shove reno
passed into what was the largest room
he had ever seen

  it was fully three-quarters of the
lower floor of this sprawling structure
above it reached by a winding stair-
the feudists



  case an overhanging gallery ran
  around the four sides and off this gal-
  lery opened a series of doors reno
  sizing it up thought the place more
  like a barracks than a ranch house
  but this was only a quickly passing
  reflection for his attention crossed
  the room to the huge fireplace beneath
  the far gallery and fastened itself to
  the man standing there

     thedore the spokesman said blunt-
   ly theres big lafe and reno walk-
   ed on until the grateful heat of the
   fire touched him and big lafe was but
   a yard away

    big lafe once had been mighty in
all his proportions even now obvious-
 ly in the seventies there was about
 him a dominating strength and a
 proud sense of power his hands were
clasped behind him thus throwing for-
ward a fine high pair of shoulders
 his thews were pionounced his bones
well covered his chest soundly arched
 well over six feet he had the tall
mans habit of bowing his head to les-
ser men he did it now and reno who
never failed to measure the worth of
men about him saw the light of those
ice-blue eyes beneath the shaggy
i bushy brows turn intent and sharp it
was a driving sort of inspection full
of insistent challenge and harshness
yet it was not brutal nor was that
long calm face openly antagonistic
rather the cast of those strong com-
manding features was one of discipline
and confidence it was clear to reno
that big lafe mcmurtree ruled with-
out doubt and had no fear

     the silence held for a long while and
   the dozen or so men in the room-all
   grouped to the rear of reno-respected
   it big lafe mcmurtree slowly unclasp-
   ed his hands and swung about to kick
   a log deeper into the fire the resultant

rise of light flooded across the room
big lafe turned bck and spoke over
renos head with a cool abruptness
whered you find him thedore 
he came up the blackrock road like
he owned it said thedore quickly
we heard him when he crossed the
plank bridge at garry creek

  seem surprised when you stopped
him

  no-o said thedore with reluc-
tance youd of thought he was doin
us a favor said he had a message for
you-and wouldnt tell me what it
was

  wouldnt tell you repeated big
lafe as if that meant something his
cutting glance whipped over to reno
what is your name

  reno

  big lafe considered it thoughtfully
deeply then said there are no renos
in blackrock where did you come
from

  i came through blackrock said
reno thats enough for you to
know

  so its like that asked big lafe
well what is the message

  reno reached into his pocket for the
note vilas had given him and handed
it over mcmurtree read what had been
written with a sort of aloof calm fold-
ed the paper and tossed it on the fire
closely watching for a reaction reno
found no disturbance on the disciplined
cheeks of this old fellow big lafes
glance came back shrewdly to him
you know what was in it

  yes

  therell be no answer said big
lafe casually

  i judged he expected none

big lafes eyes narrowed how
much of vilass business do you know
none never met the man till to-


all western

night but that doesnt stop me from
guessing

  and he picked you a stranger to
deliver this

  he said no blackrock man could
get this far

  then what caused you to tackle a
job that might of ended bad for you
 reno grinned there was some
pressure in the matter vilas agreed to
keep the posse off my trail

  big lafe shook his head he said
unexpectedly youre no crook my
boy

  thanks said reno and turned
sober theres something else ill have
to tell you this afternoon ten miles
due east of blackrock i heard a couple
shots over the hump when i got up
there i saw a fellow dying on the
ground and another fellow riding hell-
bent into the bench i could do nothing
but give the hit party a little water
before he died he asked me jo find you
and to tell you that he was gone that
two-bits was gone and that a rifle
got him

  he had expected no great show of
emotion for the short interval in this
room had told him clearly that this
group of men were bound by a quiet
and a rigid control even so it mildly
astonished him that the ensuing mo-
ments seemed as blank of sound as the
heart of the grave not one body be-
hind him shifted not one breath lifted
as for big lafe the long lips com-
pressed a little and there was passage
of feeling deep behind the eyes then
the man straightened his fine shoul-
ders and said

  how am i to believe this sir

  in my left-hand saddlebag is a gun
with a star-and-crescent inlay he asked
me to bring tjere

  big lafe made a slight motion with

an arm at which one of the crowd
walked from the room vilas-he
knows about this demanded the old
man

  i never mentioned it to him

  the hand came back from outside
no gun in either saddlebag he called
accusingly

  reno whirled around and demanded
whos been monkeyin with my gear
that gun was there

  big lafes voice took on a definite
tone of authority his words cracked
across the room thedore where is
the gun

  thedores chin raised in the light
his face seemed more unprepossessing
more slanting than by the brief rays
of the lantern the knife-scar made a
long evil track across one cheek and
those mongol eyes were narrower than
ever he said a little sullenly

  nobody has touched that horse
since i caught this man if you want
my opinion the man lies

  reno said big lafe slowly where
else could that gun have gone

  i left the horse in blackrocks stable
for half an hour i wonder-

  no need to wonder  interrupted
big lafe grimly it was lifted there
you believe that cock-and-bull
story thedore asked of big lafe

  be silent snapped big lafe he
looked to reno and some of the rigid-
ness went out of his manner i thank
you for telling me it was my nephew
you gave the drink of water to youve
done your chore what next

  ill be riding on said reno

  out of the country

  reno shook his head no ill be in
the hills for a while

  not in these hills interrupted
thedore nobody rides these hills un-
less we say so
the feudists



 unless who says so challenged
big lafe

  unless you say so amended the-
dore after a long tight pause look-
ing about reno saw thedores jaw
work into lines of balky stubbornness
big lafe said abruptly

  reno have you ever been in this
part of the country before

  no

  i think said big lafe you are
lying but we shall soon find out if
you have there is one pair of eyes in
this house that will recognize you-no
matter how long you mightve been
away rae

  the silence settled again big lafe
swung half about facing a door that
led back from the lower floor to an in-
ner room behind reno was the utter
quiet of men expecting something im-
portant to happen and with this feel-
ing in his bones-the feeling that all
his fortunes depended on the next mo-
ment-he stiffened himself that door
opened softly and a woman stepped
through to pause there immediately
afterward renos set muscles loosened
with astonishment in this house
among this rough crew was actual
beauty

  she was no more than twenty-five
a mass of black hair sat loosely above
a broad white forehead below that
were slim slightly olive features and
eyes that were dark and alive and full
of vital fire she was straight with the
graceful sureness of a splendid body
showing through the loose riding-
clothes she wore

  when she said what is it dad
the throaty richness of the words fell
on renos ears like pleasant music

  rae said big lafe have you ever
at any time seen this man before
her glance turned on him and re-

mained steady and solemn reno stif-
fened again and a blankness settled
across his cheeks he saw her lips part
slightly she seemed to bend forward
avhile she studied him to collect every
item of his individuality in that long
long survey without any doubt some
quick reaction took place in her for
her hands half rose and fell then she
turned her head swiftly toward big
lafe

  no she said in a kind of breath-
less tone i never have

  never challenged thedore
  never said the girl

  thats all put in big lafe if you
say jou have never seen him then hes
a stranger your memory is longer
than any i ever knew

  she started to turn back big lafe
cleared his throat and said slowly
two-bits is dead rae

  the girl started whirled about reno
saw her eyes widen in pure pain and
then fill but a moment later she was
gone closing the door behind her big
lafe spoke once more

  youll stay here tonight reno ill
show you a room thedore see that
his horse is put up

  he belongs in the tool shed mut-
tered thedore with a couple of men
guardin him youre foolish to trust-
butbig lafe swept that aside with
an ironic calm ill run the mcmurtree
affairs a few years longer yet the-
dore reno come with me

  taking up a near-by lamp he slowly
climbed the stairs and turned along
the gallery at one open door he halt-
ed passed the lamp to the following
reno and bowed courteously

  trust you rest well he said you
are a smart man reno you know
more than appears on the record and
i do not doubt you have your own pur-


all western

poses to serve for tonight well let
the matter rest

  what purpose asked reno with a
show of idle curiosity would be bring-
ing me to this country

  dont know answered big lafe
but theyll soon be disclosed no man
can go it alone up here remember
that youre nobodys fool vilas picked
you to do a chore-and he knows men
so do i

  youre thinking maybe ill be in
your way suggested reno

  remains to be seen said big lafe
and looked more closely at reno
there is he added with a heavy
slowness a slight possibility you
might be a help to me

  when youve got it figured out
said reno let me know

  good night

  reno nodded and went in closing
the door he placed the lamp on the
small table by the bed sat on the edge
of that bed and slowly removed his
boots big lafes solid footsteps re-
treated down the stairway and there
was a rising hum of voices from be-
low broken by one angry accent that
lifted and fell in the adjoining room
a board squeaked slightly bringing
renos narrowed eyes toward the flim-
sy partition

  with the boot in his hand he got
up crossed to the only window and
from that point of view looked into
the ranch yard a man was at this mo-
ment leading his horse to the barn
nearer at hand he saw a second fellow
stolidly draped against a corral fence
the meaning of this ones location was
clear enough pulling the shade down
reno walked back to the bed

  this much of it is accomplished
he said slowly to himself its a be-
ginning-nothing more the rest of its

going to be a lot harder

  his thoughts were broken by a soft
drumming of finger tips against the
wall once more riveting his attention
there he saw what he had not noticed
before-the four thin seams of a door-
way in that boarded surface a door-
way without latch or keyhole or knob
saying nothing-for the softness of the
signal sounded to him more like a
warning than an announcement-he
sat quite still in the next moment the
wall door swung open and rae mc-
murtree stood before him

          chapter four
          memory rides

ne white hand rose in
a gesture of caution
and her eyes flashed
quickly over toward
the drawn shade

  what are you do-
  ing here

  delivering a mes-
sage to your dad

  she waved that aside with an impa-
tient gesture of her small hand what
else

  to deliver another one you prob-
ably didnt hear

  what was it

  if it is to be told answered reno
your dad will probably do the tell-
ing

  she had been crying he could see
that tears were not far off now and
the last words of the unfortunate two-
bits occurred to him again theres
only one woman to grieve for a black
mcmurtree this reno suddenly real-
ized was the woman and she was
grieving it prompted a gentler speech
on his part

  that young lad-that two-bits boy
the feudists



was thinking of you when he died
stop it said rae do you want
me to bring all the house up here
thought it was something you
might want to know

  i dont want to think of it now i
dont want to cry till i get out of here
listen-why are you in these hills 
ive answered

  no you have not neither message
brought you here it is something
else

  how do you figure it demanded
reno

  you have fooled everybody else on
the place the dark level eyes held
his attention relentlessly if you pass-
ed through blackrock you probably
fooled all the people there but i know
you i remember you when i stepped
into the living-room tonight i could
have called your name

why didnt you do it asked reno
she didnt reply but her head moved
negatively from side to side and the
blackness of her eyes glowed with in-
ner light

  why are you here she asked

  im on the dodge the sheriff is
down in the valley so im up in the
hills is that plain enough rae
dont call me that
why not

  the girls answer was cool frank
because you will betray me into call-
ing you by your first name in front of
the crew

  all right agreed reno im not
that man hes dead i came up here to
deliver a message

  hold out your right hand directed
rae mcmurtree and when reno obey-
ed her forefinger touched the heel of
his palm and traced a slim white scar
running across it you see she half
whispered i know jim where are

you going

  away from this ranch in the morn-
ing if im allowed

  you will not be allowed

  renos glance sharpened a little is
that what you came to tell me

  partly said the girl partly that
and to warn you not to give yourself
away to any man on this place never
let anybody know what your real iden-
tity is or your real purpose-whatever
that may be you are not with friends
there are mcmurtrees in these hills
who would betray you i wanted to tell
you that

 then her manner changed again
turned harder but listen to me i am
a mcmurtree all of me and there is
nothing in all the world i despise so
much as those men who are set against
us all the bitterness in my fathers
life all his mistakes all the violent
things he has had to do are because of
those men who hounded him drove
him here made outlaws out of my kin

  that she added is a warning i
dont know yet what you are up to or
who you are working for but should
it be for those who are fighting us-
ill turn you over to the crew

  fair enough rae said reno and
was about to say something else when
her quick signal of hand stopped him
in an instant she had turned and re-
treated to the other room drawing the
door behind her soundlessly

  somebody came up the stairs two at
a time and strode rapidly along the gal-
lery renos door burst open and the-
dore stood there his chest laboring
with the quickness of his movement
and his sullen eyes pinned to a reno
who stood calmly in his stocking feet
and tapered off a cigarette thedore
walked across the room brushing reno
back toward the bed and he rolled


all western



the shade up from the window angrily

  you leave that thing alone he
grunted and see that your light
burns all night get it

  i understand english

  let me have your gun was the-
dores peremptory order he stretched
his fist outward

  reno lighting his cigarette studied
the hand carelessly no i guess not
by god you will breathed the-
dore

  whos running this show you or
big lafe demanded reno he said
nothing about this gun so i keep it
thedore swung about walked to the
doorway and looked carefully along
the gallery when he came back it was
to face reno across a shoulders dis-
tance-so close at hand that reno saw
the slate-green flecks in the mans odd
hostile eyes

  all right muttered thedore if
you understand english try to get this
clear if mcmurtree lets you ride on
tomorrow you see that you ride on-a
damned long ways on dont light any
campfires within thirty miles of this
rancho i dont want you around
tow dont suggested reno you
personally dont

  thats right i dont

  and what worries you so much
thedores stubborn jaws shot out-
ward nothing right now mister and
i mean to see nothing does in the fu-
ture thats why im telling you sleep
on it youre old enough to know what
happens when a little sound advice is
disregarded

  with that last thrust thedore back-
ed out of the loom and shut the door
reno stood on his feet long enough to
hear the man cross the lower hall and
leave it going to the window then he
found the guard still posted by the cor-

ral and presently saw thedore come
around the house corner and leave
some terse order with the man the
rest of the people of the ranch seemed
to have settled for the night no sound
broke the pervading quiet inside this
castle of the hills treading the narrow
confines of his room the last of the
cigarette sputtering betweenhis lips
reno thought out his position with a
studious intensity

  one thing he reflected appears
plain the old man runs affairs but
hes got opposition on the part of this
thedore that may mean something
depends on how the rest of the crew
throw their vote

  afterward he ground the stump of
the cigarette between his fingers and
rolled in for a welcome sleep

  breakfast was a glum affair in a long
mess hall back of the main room reno
saw the strength of the mcmurtree
ranch for the first time and was mildly
astonished at the number of hands
present there were his quick count
told him more than twenty-five men
on the place and that meant another
half dozen out on remote chores the
stiff and stern big lafe who sat at the
head of the table and drank a sparing
cup of coffee had thirty ready guns at
his command thedore sat at the op-
posite end of the table from which
circumstance reno judged that the
sullen one was more or less of a fore-
man thedores cast of features was
increasingly dour and his eyes con-
tained a sleepy surliness as if he had
been up most of the night the girl at
her fathers immediate right never
glanced renos way during the meal

  after breakfast reno strolled to the
big hall then nothing being said to
him he went out into the crisp early
sunshine that flooded the long mead-
the feudists



ow it was a high meadow with the
hint of sharply descending slopes be-
yond the timber the air was thin and
rich and renos cigarette had a fine
savor to it yet as he idled toward the
string of outbuildings he felt a portent
of trouble coming from behind none
of the mcmurtree people were to be
seen all of them had remained in the
house hoisting himself to the top rail
of a corral he presently saw them
leave the house and from the scowling
manner in which they broke across the
yard he knew they had been in a hot
and heavy session big lafe remained
on the porch his daughter with him
thedore strode on to the barn and in
a little while reno saw a group of men
surrounding the foreman all talking
renos ready mind leaped at the inevi-
table conclusion

  right there is the opposition big
lafes hostile foreman has got ready
followers

  his thoughts were broken by the old
mans voice booming across the yard
get out a couple horses thedore
dont stand there dreamin

 thedore wrenched himself away
from the group with an obstinate twist
of his shoulders the girl left the porch
and came on toward reno slapping a
romal carelessly against her breeches
leg a small felt hat sat insouciantly
back on the dark head and a beaded
indian jacket made a bright play of
colors but when she stopped in front
of reno he saw the sober cloud run-
ning across her eyes and the serious
pursing of her lips

  were going for a little ride she
said

  reno chuckled and slid down from
the corral

  who he wanted to know is the
escort and who is the escorted

  that broke her gravity she smiled
slightly back at him

  the gentleman usually escorts the
lady

  the horses came up led by a morose-
faced man who dropped the reins and
stalked away in complete silence they
rode to the tree line and went single
file down a twisted trail that buckled
at the bottom of a canyon and climbed
the far side it was a mile or more be-
fore they came to the heights of a
ridge and were able to ride abreast

  theres some purpose to this sash-
ay queried reno

  rae looked at him again bending
that intent scrutiny on his features
after a moment she said are you al-
ways digging for purposes jim

  ive traveled pretty much alone
answered reno with considerable
thoughtfulness and have found little
charity along the way somebody al-
ways wants something its been my
policy to find out what ive had to
and youve turned into a man that
runs before a posse she said rather
bitterly what did you do was it
very bad

  im not a full-fledged outlaw
drawled reno let it go like that
they wore riding south along the
ridge and from time to time past
sweeping vistas of the far-off crossjack
plain a few miles farther during
which time not more than half a dozen
words had been spoken the girl swung
with an apparent aimlessness to the
westward and they came upon a lesser
spur leading off toward that plain

  my father said the girl after a
prolonged silence is a proud man in
some ways too proud he looks back-
ward-always backward somewhere
in the southern states there is a fam-
ily plantation and a family record that


all western

lists the mcmurtrees clear into queen
elizabeths time one mcmurtree was
a captain in drakes fleet one was a
general in the revolution one was a
senator these are the things he re-
members

  and its made him a little bitter

  the girls voice filled with energy
why shouldnt it until twenty years
ago he was an honest man a wealthy
man with a great ranch out there on
that plain he pioneered that country
then the robbers came and the cattle
war came and they fought him until he
was bankrupt and they drove him up
here with nothing to his name they
have been fighting him ever since
well what could he do but fight back
but the thing that hurts most is that
he has had to fight as they fought-
and that kind of fighting is without
honesty do you see now

  yes said reno then thought of
something else who is this the-
dore

  she flashed him a swift sharp
glance you are quick to observe
arent you thedore is our foreman
he came with us about two years ago
he is the only man-her voice sank a
little as she said it-on the ranch who
is not in some way related to me

  she drew up then for they had come
to a point of land that fell sheerly into
an off-running glen a half mile be-
yond was a sweep of open meadow and
a group of buildings gray and dis-
jointed in the bright sunshine the
girl pointed with a gloved hand and
spoke again more to herself than to
him

  theres the sort of thing that hap-
pens in this country once upon a time
years ago a family lived on that place
they were rich they were respected
but when the cattle war came along

they were between fires too close to
the hills too close to tfie plain the
man tried to be neutral and conse-
quently everybody hated him so one
night somebody ambushed hi benton
and killed him his wife and little boy
had to move out i used to play with
that boy i have often wondered what
happened to him

  reno looked down at the place with-
out visible expression the silence
lengthened out until it became strain-
ed and the girl at last said

  if i have brought back unpleasant
memories jim im sorry only you
cannot pretend to me not to me
reno looked at her all right rae
heres hi bentons son back home
its been a great many years every-
things changed i havent got exactly
the same body the same face nor the
same mind how did you recognize
me

  never mind murmured the girl
perhaps it is because i always ex-
pected you to come back perhaps there
were things i never forgot-about you
but the moment i stepped into the
room and saw you i knew as it was
i almost betrayed you-almost called
your right name

  wait a minute weve got to get this
straight i was jim benton until three
months ago when i decided to come
into this country i changed my name
i had to do that i had to get a new
name and a new frame of mind so that
nobody would ever come up behind
me call out my old name and take me
off guard i went to another country as
jim reno i practiced on that name
until it was more mine than the old
one then i lit out for here

  and you changed your habits too
asked the girl a little forlornly to
the extent that you came here with a
the feudists



posse on your heels im sorry

  dont be too sorry he warned her
this is a dangerous game im play-
ing

  what game asked the girl

  you ought to know what would
bring me back when dad was killed
mother and i had to leave that hurt
rae its been hurting ever since what
could a woman and a small kid do we
went to another valley and i had to
grow up and become the man of the
family all these years ive had the
killing of my dad on my mind never
forgot it never let it die mother had
a pretty tough time but she always
paid taxes on this old place just to
keep it up we never knew who used it
or lived in it still we kept it when i
got old enough she made me promise
not to come here she was afraid i
kept the promise-right up till she
died about six months ago then i
made my plans his voice chilled and
 he spoke more slowly im back now
to find out who killed dad thats the
whole story

  your mother was right breathed
the girl you shouldnt be here you
will never be able to uncover that mys-
tery and if you do you will be killed
he shook his head thats why im
here i dont think ill ever leave this
land again now remember rae my
name is jim reno even when you
think of me think of me as reno so
that your tongue wont slip ive put
the old name behind me forgotten it
its dead-and will be until i have
learned all that i want to learn

  all right said rae mcmurtree
quietly

  reno turned toward the little valley
below pointing who uses the ranch
now

  its free range said the girl

though theres always cattle grazing
on it and usually some party or an-
other using it for occasional shelter
rae whats the gossip around here
-about my dads death

  only whispers replied the girl
youve got to realize jim that no-
body cared much about you people
the mcmurtrees didnt trust your fa-
ther because he didnt have anything
to do with them the vilas faction as
i get it was always more or less afraid
of him thats all i know but ive been
sorry

  they started back along the same
trail and wandered off into another
glen once they saw the distant house-
tops of a settlement which reno guess-
ed to be morgantown afterward the
thick forest enveloped them and it was
past high noon when they cantered in-
to the mcmurtree clearing reno got
down

  what was the purpose of this ride
he demanded bluntly

  the girl studied him at length and
seemed to make up her mind for one
thing to see if youd try to break away
im glad you didnt

  reno turned half about and nodded
his head at the timber thedore was
just then emerging from the trees

  i knew better than to try said
reno he was within gunshot all the
way waiting for me to break

  the girl revealed a quick disappoint-
ment was that all that kept you from
running

  no i wouldnt have tried in any
event im here to weather it through
rae

  im glad to hear you say so said
the girl as for the rest of my pur-
pose it was to find why you came here
i was told to get the reason from you
if i could


all western

  you asked no questions

  i didnt have to jim i was pretty
sure i already knew

 and now said reno grimly you
can go back to your dad and report
when you want to be observed
the girl sadly you are very very
hard i am not telling my father why
you are here or who you are

 why not

  before that happens i want you to
find out something for yourself
which is what

  i want you to find out said the
girl more energetically whether or
not a mcmurtree fired the shot that got
your father then she bent nearer
for thedore was slowly closing up
and whispered if you have any eyes
at all you can see that my father is in
trouble and that this ranch is badly
split perhaps-perhaps jim you may
be able to help nobody else can or
will i have little hope

 thedore rode abreast and spoke
heavily had your parade i see

 the girl turned without answering
and walked to the house reno feeling
hungry followed at a more indolent
pace at the door he paused to look
around thedores sultry mongol eyes
were unwinkingly set on him

chapter five
the rifle speaks again

afternoon turned
ter left complete-
to himself reno
awhile on the
in-house porch un
his muscles cramp-
on him and a sense
restlessness drove
him over to the yard as far as the barn
crouched there in the semi-twilight of

that structures long stable he drew
aimless patterns in the dust while his
mind went ferreting among the possi-
bilities he felt quite clearly that the
drowsing lull about him was rippling
with cross-currents of trickery and de-
ceit there was something in the offing
some crisis of events thus when at
about four oclock thedore came from
one of the bunkhouses and went to the
main house gt a rapid stride reno felt
a half relief and a half excitements

  thedore walked in with the swag-
gering sureness of one whose power
was certain enough to depend on reno
even heard the man calling big lafes
name throughout the great hall call-
ing it peremptorily after that quiet
returned but the mcmurtree crew be-
gan to appear in the yard two at a
time one of these ostentatiously
walked to the barn and there halted
half a dozen strolled indolently toward
the main-house porch and took station
there the rest of the outfit straggled
from point to point

  all this however was changed when
thedore again made his appearance
on the porch his voice lifted through
the quiet afternoon like the echo of a
brazen horn

  billy you stay at the stable every-
body else come in here

  in response all the men went to the
house with an ill-concealed alacrity
except that one nearest reno he came
closer and leaned against the barn
wall

  itll be all right i suppose drawl-
ed reno ironically if i scratch my
nose

  the man only glowered and contin-
ued his open watchfulness there were
sounds of high and angry talk from
the main house sharp echoes rolled
across the yard time passed dragging-
the feudists



ly and even the guard began to fiddle
in his tracks looking at his watch
reno was surprised to find it was after
five a short time later the meeting
broke up and the crew appeared

  thedore strode toward the corrals
with part of the outfit compactly
around him and reno studying all this
with a deep watchfulness thought that
this group accompanying the foreman
was larger than the one he had ob-
served in the morning the rest of the
bunch followed to the corrals more
slowly some of them separated and
headed in the direction of the bunk-
houses when those men came to view
again they were armed

 meanwhile heavy dust rolled out
of the corrals fresh ponies were led
into the yard saddled and left stand-
ing by the main house porch thedore
spoke a subdued word to a pair of men
near him and these immediately
mounting went away to the south just
as the supper triangle began to beat
up brassy eddies of sound without
further invitation reno went in to eat
when he returned again to the porch
the sun had fallen and dusk was
shrouding the sky big lafe came
through the door and stood beside him

  youll ride with the men tonight
he said abruptly

 where to and what for asked
reno

  the question will answer itself in
due course said big lafe then he
added you are entitled to a reason
of course the men feel that if you are
a party to possible trouble this evening
youll be in the middle of it with
them

 sound politics applauded reno
dryly i take it im not free to leave
this ranch and im even less welcome
to stay

   your coming here has brought a
 complication i never expected said
 big lafe

   mcmurtree replied reno unex-
 pectedly frank take this for what its
 worth if you expect to deal the same
 brand of cards you been dealin for a
 number of years you better get an-
 other jack of spades the card is worn
 out full of thumb marks

   mcmurtree turned and started to
 speak but was prevented by the ap-
 pearance of the outfit filing across the
 yard

   all right reno called thedore
 heres your rig

    thedore said big lafe ill be go-
 ing with you get my pony

   thedore sat back in the saddle and
 grunted his surprise

   it will be the first time in a coons
 age what for

   when i get to the point of explain-
 ing my mind to you said big lafe it
 will be a sorry world get my pony
 theres no need of it argued the-
 dore im able to take care of this if
 you want it plain id like you to stay
 here we travel fast

   damn you-get my pony  boomed
 big lafe when i speak i intend to
 be obeyed

   thedore let out a great gust of
 breath but said nothing a man on
 one flank of the party silently wheeled
 away to the barn a wind ran gently
 across the porch and reno all at once
 full of admiration for this old hard-
 bitten wolf of the hills saw big lafes
  grizzled hair ruff up on nis head the
 man stood there like a rock implaca-
 ble and without the knowledge of fear
 or physical weakness he spoke again
 to his foreman with cutting calm

   you are growing too big for your
 pants thedore on my pay sheet


all western

youre listed as a command hand
dont forget that and dont make it
necessary for me to have to remind
you of it again

  the day is about gone said the-
dore with rage tightening his throat
when you can speak to me like that
here and now i warn you against
tryin it again

  youll take it and youll like it
snapped big lafe his voice as cold as
stone

  all the rest of the outfit seemed to
quit breathing rae came out of the
hall coming between her father and
reno the rider came back with the
old mans horse and held the reins out
thedore said almost under his breath
all right and spurred away from
the group big lafe walked slowly to
his saddle and climbed up reno on
the verge of following heard the girls
bated whisper

  dont let thedore ride beside you
alone

  reno left the porch and stepped to
the leather at that the group wheeled
away two and two led by thedore
and big lafe and cantered across the
meadow

  two miles of steady pacing in star-
lit darkness ended without warning in
a complete halt a sibilant murmur
ran along the line and certain men
detached themselves from it and trot-
ted ahead cow smell came up with
the wind then the cavalcade pointed
into another of the countless depres-
sions and within the space of minutes
they were on the sides of a compact
group of cattle

 the herd had been previously
bunched and made ready that much
was plain to reno what also was plain
to him was that big lafes outfit had
done this enough times before to have

perfected a discipline that needed no
added commanding the group shifted
left and right until there was only a
single man at renos side-and this
one obviously instructed to remain so
a lantern suddenly flashed and went
out after describing a complete circle
at that signal cattle and men moved
forward downgrade

  somewhere ahead thedore called
out billy and the man beside reno
answered its all right another
rider cut back and came up on renos
pther flank

  ive got this taken care of an-
nounced billy with a trace of belliger-
ence

  what are you trying to do said
big lafes still voice notify the coun-
try were abroad tonight get the hell
up forward and tell thedore to shut
up

  all right grumbled billy didnt
know it was you he pulled away and
vanished among the shadows

  the clearing fell into a long decline
with gentle slopes rising on either
side an admirable runway for night
driving all this had the earmarks of
thoughtful planning by the feel of the
mass moving ahead reno judged that
there were no more than a hundred
head in the bunch which was a two-
 three-man job instead of a job need-
ing the present twenty-odd hands the
extra hands he concluded were meant
for trouble-the trouble that comes of
moving stolen cattle by night

  this was an old story and he pieced
out the rest of it with no great strain
of thinking the stock had been gath-
ered a few head at a time thrown into
the secret pocket and held there until
the herd was made what went on now
was a drive to some receiver elsewhere
in the hills who would push the beef
the feudists



on to market big lafe mcmurtree the
descendent of captains and statesmen
had turned to this

  youre letting me into the whole
 story mcmurtree reno remarked

  it was a long time before big lafe
 answered there was a date in his-
 tory he finally muttered when a
 brigand was considered a good citizen
 writers wrote stories about them i
 dont hold any such illusions a cattle
 thief is a cattle thief which is what i
 am but what lies behind all this is
 something you dont know you see
 damned little of the story here the
 rest will come soon enough

  a rider pushed his way back beside
 the old man and murmured something
 indistinct big lafe said turn short
 at sweetgrass creek and go across the
 bridge

  the rider went forward again and
 presently the momentum of the herd
 was temporarily checked the flank
 men began to crowd against the cattle
 romals slapping down reno coming
 along the dusty rear felt the ground

 	shift upward and later downward as
 the trail bent at the end of three tedi-
 ous miles reno found the unbroken
 expanse of the prairie lying below and
 beyond he knew then where he was
 for in the distance-in the far western
 distance-the lights of blackrock
 winked through the gloom

  these cattle he thought were prob-
 ably rustled from that prairie now
 theyre going back to the prairie
 which is damned odd

  hardly had he come to the conclu-
 sion when a signal flash appeared off
 to the immediate left-a lantern un-
 cloaked and held high in another mo-
 ment it was concealed again but the
 circling mcmurtree hands had seen the
 warning and instantly began rounding

 the herd to check it the light appear-
 ed again more briefly a rider came
 back from the head of the column and
 reined in beside big lafe

  thedores voice said

  well sir

  come along answered big lafe

  the two of them turned abreast and
aimed for that point where the light
had been reno mind racing down the
channels of his own scheming wheeled
and retreated a good fifty yards here
he halted

  theres the receiver of the stolen
goods he thought him with the light
but what the hell whats the point in
running the beef back to where it
came from

  once the light rose straight from the
earth and he dimly viewed the form of
that third party the receiver then the
light went out there was a parley go-
ing on a very short parley terminated
by big lafes voice calling calmly
back all right boys

  the hands began to drift toward
reno the job was done the transfer
made on the sharp lookout reno saw
big lafe and thedore appear in the
night

  if i want to get out of this outfit
reno warned himself here is the best
chance ill ever have if i stay on ill
have thedore to handle before another
days done

  all the mcmurtree hands however
had gathered a few yards away and
were sitting still in their saddles
queerly still and speechless big lafe
and thedore advanced at a trot but
within the length of ten yards one of
them-reno thought it was thedore-
swerved aside and went on at a slight-
ly faster pace a low cautious call rose
from the mcmurtree ranks

  say-lafe where are the rest of


all western

those fellows

  it is none of our business where
they are answered lafe now turning
beside reno our job is done come
on

  thedores lunging yell came from
behind the cattle furiously

 watch out-watch out

  and then the night burst with the
stunning reverberations of a chasm
falling in a stuttering roar of gunfire
smashed the calm of the hillside and
the echoes bounded off the earth enor-
mously stripes of crimson painted the
darkness a hundred jrards off to the
eastward over in the direction the re-
ceiver had been dust rose around
reno dust kicked up by the thudding
lead a mcmurtree hand cried out as if
his heart were breaking and the ponies
began pitching in a senseless jammed-
up confusion a form raced at reno
cursed his blackest rage and went
screaming to the ground the herd
broke like water through a caving
dam thundering off toward the valley
somewhere farther away than before
thedore yelled again the meaning of
his words quite lost

  reno crouched low in the leather
watching that long row of flame points
glow and die and glow in that fraction
of time he knew there was only one
answer-a quick retreat he curbed his
pitching horse and pushed beside big
lafe who seemed to have been strick-
en to the spot

 here-get out of this call your
boys out of it

 but big lafe had no answer the
old man was sitting stiff in the saddle
and he was facing the fire reno reach-
ed over to catch the reins of the others
pony and missed he had no second
chance for the mcmurtree hands broke
and came racing on the weight of

that flight carried reno away from big
lafe his horse was bumped dead on
went to its knees and got up again
some of the mcmurtree crew began to
answer the shots aiming with un-
thinking recklessness and the heavy
blast of one of their guns stung renos
neck

 meanwhile the opposing fusillade
was veering coming closer slugs
struck all around him another mc-
murtree rider fell shouting up from
beneath the mad churning hoofs reno
was hit again by a passing horse and
then knowing he had lost all contact
with big lafe he hauled his mount
around and fought through the press
of brute and man he literally plowed
a trail into the clear to find himself
eventually alone on the margin of
some stunted pines

  the firing fell short of him the mc-
murtree outfit had left the open soon
he detected a shift in the fightingthe
sounds from the ambushers subsided
considerably and while he sat there in
the saddle detached and coolly consid-
ering he made out a turning move-
ment of those ambushers they halted
the barrage of lead completely for as
long a space as it took to draw half a
dozen deep breaths then suddenly-
for everything happened with whip-
lash speed-a long and strung-out
shadow undulated across the far edge
of the open area and vanished down
the grade at that the mcmurlrees be-
gan to halloo like hounds on the scent
they gathered in the brush came out
of it and flung themselves by the im-
movable reno and presently they too
were lost off there on the heels of the
ambushers an occasional shots echo
rose to mark their running

  theyll be scattered all over the
hills from now till daylight he said
f

t and a lot of blood will be left in the
 sand then poised with all his senses
 probing the night he was aware of a
 stir on the lower edge of the clearing

i instinctively reno bent forward and
i placed a hand over the nostrils of his
 pony seeing a shadow drift up and

	halt all he made out was a tall form
 on a horse and even that was present-
s ly blurred as the man circled the clear-
 ing once and then went off at a drum-
 ming speed to the eastward

   reno gathered up the reins and
 swung around the other way

    ive got to go back to the ranch he
  decided grimty and come to a show-
  down with those boys if i run now
  theyll hunt me all through the hills
  and ill get nothing done then an en-
  tirely different thought displaced the
  lesser ones in his mind and he dwelt
  on it with a studied interest and an
  increasing suspicion thedore got be-
  hind the protection of the cattle before
  the firing started when he shouted he
  was away off from the trouble when
  he shouted the second time he was still
  farther off i wonder if it was thedore
  who crossed the clearing just now

   he carried that wonder all the way
  to a high point of the hills and then
  dismissed it in face of a more immedi-
  ate consideration which was to find
  the way back to the ranch one ridge
  and another fooled him a half-dozen
  trails led him into the blindness of un-
  traveled canyons when at last he
   picked up the clear light of the mc-
  murtree house the sky overhead was
  paling and day hovered just below the
  eastern rim there was no sign of life
  in the yard and no evidence of return-
  ed hands he opened the door and
  strode inside to find big lafe standing
  by a dying fire with the girl beside
  him



            chapter six
            cross play

	ig lafe made no ges-

dpnj	ture but he said

nfu i p harshly so you came
it yl- back

             what else was
there to do asked
 reno crossing the
-	room

you might have kept going mut-
tered big lafe

a sudden break of light appeared on 
the giits solemn cheeks there was an
actual blaze of feeling in her eyes as
she turned to the old man

i knew he would she cried i
told you he would he had no part in
that trap

no said reno i didnt

you might have kept going re-
peated big lafe

sure and that would have clinched
me with your boys i couldnt stay in
the hills that way theyd hunt me all
over hells half acre

you consider theyll believe you for
a minute big lafe asked and he
answered his own question with a
shake of his head no youre done for
on this ranch

youre giving me my walkin pa-
pers

for your own good he answered
ieno reached for his cigarette to-
bacco and shook out a smoke scowling
over the job when he looked up there
was an added sharpness of expression
on his fae

it fits better into my plans to stay
here and tough it through

i knew you had your own irons in
the fire observed big lafe that
stuck out all over you

reno looked to the girl but she

the feudists


all western

shook her head slightly then he
asked

  men arent back no i didnt sup-
pose they would be theyll be scat-
tered forty miles all ways and drag in
one at a time i dont get this ambush
stuff but itll come to me sooner or
later seems to be more crooked turns
to the road than i figured he lighted
a match and touched it to the cigarette
tip his eyes were bright and hard
mcmurtree your foreman is a scoun-
drelly dog

  i knew that said big lafe

  so grunted reno you already
knew it and you keep him on

  big lafe nodded and reno watching
the old mans face said reflectively
so its like that youve got him and
you cant get shut of him hes too
much to fire

  big lafe gave him no answer yet
reno saw agreement written on that
bold tired face big lafe squared his
shoulders and let out a deep breath

  reno he said i know youre not
a crook i also know youve got a level
head what i dont know is how good
a fighter you are but thats your risk
not mine how about it

 what do you want done was
renos prompt answer

  i want you to go tell vilas to draw
off quick if he dont therell be an-
other war i cant stop my boys and i
dont want to see them killed vilas
has got to draw out

  vilas asked rae what has he to
do with us hes no friend of ours
it is something even you dont
know said big lafe wearily reno
youve caught on

  i sort of suspected the message
vilas sent you was misleading drawl-
ed reno

  it was not a threat agreed big

lafe it was an arrangement the key
of it was his reference to the base of
drum peak that is where we went
tonight with the cattle

  i dont understand said the girl

  it had better be explained now 
was big lafes grim answer youve
always known we rustled stock off the
prairie rae

  yes said the girl in a low voice
i have

  there is no excuse for thieving
muttered big lafe i make none for
myself but its been in my mind to
make an end to it a long while i would
have done so except that thedore
came along my counsel of moderation
was no good against thedore he
could always stir the boys desire for
revenge to a crazy pitch now he
thinks lies bigger than i am i begin
to believe he is

  he is said reno bluntly

  but what about vilas asked the
girl

 years ago vilas was the leader
against me in the war sinde i have
come to the hills hes continued this
leadership-apparently but some few
years back he came secretly to me and
said we might both profit the mans a
crook and a sly one he suggested i
enlarge the rustlin business steal
from everybody on the plain includ-
ing himself then hed arrange to take
the rustled stuff at fit occasions and
market it it was an easy way for me
to make money nobody ever suspected
vilas of course because he had helped
drive me out of the plain he had only
one man he let into the secret which
was this foreman of his hale wolfert
wolfert handles everything wolferts
got his own separate crew who consid-
er it a deal that wolfert is puttin over
on vilas and everybody else nobody
the feudists



  on our side knows of it except the-
  dore the rest of the boys are in the
  dark all they know is that somebody
  comes up after night meets me and
  gets the beef theyve never even seen
   wolferts face

    the girl slowly turned away walked
  to the far side of the fireplace big

	lafe watched her out of his fine trou-
  bled eyes and he said gently

    i make no excuses rae i will say
  i have tried to stop but thedore
  holds the whip over the boys now not
  me

    then get rid of him said the girl
  with a sudden anger

    i am older than i thought i was
  big lafe answered and in that answer
  reno heard a profqhnd sadness he
  threw his cigarette into the fire

     all right ill go tell vilas

   and then what demanded the
girl were no better off thedore is
f still here what will we do

i  ill come back said reno the
 words dropping softly into the stillness
of that great room and maybe we
 can figure it out

 youll never be safe on this ranch
t warned big lafe

    i have known very little safety in
 the last few years reflected reno
t looking into the fire and mighty lit-
 tie sense of comfort whats the odds
l i came here to do a chore this busi-

	ness fits in thats all the whole story
 of it so long till i see you again

i he went across the room and out the
i door to his horse but he had not yet
 turned away when he heard the girl
 calling to him she came over the
i porch and stood at the animals side
i looking up with her oval features dim-
f ly outlined in the gray dawn her hand
touched him

 jim she whispered youre riding

among hard men the hardest men in
the world whatever youve done that
was wrong i dont care but youve
got to look out for yourself if you go
out what is there left-for me

  ill be back murmured reno

  he rode off across the meadow down
the little trail at the end of two miles
he came to the morgantown-blackrock
road just as the sunless morning broke
about him and the mist weaths began
to evaporate he rode rapidly tense in
expectation of the unexpected when
he topped the heights he deserted the
trail altogether and pushed downward
through heavy brush and sapling
stands at sunup he turned a bend and
came upon a glade encircled by thick
virgin timber as he did so all the force
of surprise drove his rein arm into a
checking gesture

 ahead-only a hundred feet ahead-
hale wolfert crouched over a small
fire the sound of renos approach was
faint yet it stiffened the man instant-
ly he shot to his full ungainly height
and whirled about reaching for the
blackened gun butt at his side reno
coldly realizing there was no other
course open swayed in the saddle and
made a swift grab for his own weapon
as his fingers closed about it he heard
a vindictive voice come from behind
him

  youre covered stop the draw

  it took reno off his guard it com-
pleted his rout all he could do was
check his try completely covered-for
wolferts gun had risen to a steady
aim-he understood now that his only
chance of survival rested on the delib-
erateness of his surrender that mo-
ment became an hour and the silence
went flat and breathless mastering the
savage impulse to make a fight of it
he slowly dragged his hand from the


all western

gun and turned still more slowly in the
saddle to face the rear man

  it was thedore thedores eyes
were red slashes and his mouth was a
pale crease

  put up your hands said thedore
put em up as high as youve ever
reached

  reno started to obey then the
morning split apart and a long echo
swelled up the canyon wolfert had
fired reno felt something strike the
side of his head with all the stunning
effect of a club the world faded and
he fell without a murmur the strength
going out of him as from an enor-
mous distance he heard the gun roar
again after that he knew nothing

           chapter seven
           the wolf pack

hen he came out of
the deep stupor a dull
ache knocked against
his head in rhythm
with his pulse and
the bitter taste of
blood was in his
mouth all the side of
his face was wet his battered nerves
were trembling along shoulder and
neck he felt weak very weak and so
for a while he made no attempt to
move or to open his-eyes that-the
sense of being detached from himself-
was what saved him the pervading
silence into which he wakened was a
moment later broken by a voice and
that voice acted on him in the manner
of water thrown over his face it
screwed his faculties up and even
checked the throbbing of his brain
motionless eyes closed he identified
those harsh tones as thedores

      cant stay here forever wol-

fert wont do if some of the mcmur-
tree boys stumble into us

  weve got to talk this out

  talk it quick then your shots made
a hell of a racket-and didnt do much
good either renos only creased hell
pull himself together pretty soon
then whatre we going to do with
him

  if he hadnt swung around when i
fired id got him right in the gizzard
which has nothin to do with the
facts whatll we do with him hes
onto us we cant let him pack that
secret around

  maybe the next slug will land bet-
ter said wolfert slowly suggestively

  reno heard those words trail into
the dreamy stillness of the morning
the men were behind him knowing
this he opened his eyes a little and
saw his horse standing twenty yards
off cropping the grass thedore spoke
with a rough hastiness

  you do it then

leave it to me said wolfert
damn but youre a cool sport
whats the difference droned
wolfert but weve got to talk this
out our little play last night worked
all right didnt it

  i blamed near didnt get out of
range before your men opened up
you mightve waited another count of
ten after i shouted

  the boys was a little quick ad-
mitted wolfert i hadnt no more than
stepped back from meetin you and big
lafe before they started the shootin
the trouble was your bunch started
away from the clearin quick and
theyd been beyond hittin in another
second if you want my opinion big
lafe acted cagey it was the first time
in several months he came along with
the party
the feudists



 i think said thedore slowly
that the bunch smelled something
well it will turn out just like we
wanted it to turn out the mcmurtrees
will figure they were led into a double
cross theyll go hog-wild theyll start
the war up again

  no contradicted thedore theyll
think some other rustlin outfit timed
it to cut in they dont know whos be-
hind the play big lafe is the only one
that knows about vilas

 thats where you come in said
wolfert when you go back to the
ranch you spill that say vilas is in it
say he arranged this affair thatll
make em ready to come down off the
hills

 yeah how would i know this
theyll ask me how i know

 easy explained wolfert you
tell the mcmurtrees you saw me and a
couple other of vilass hands rushin
through the timber about daylight
that puts you in no comfortable
position

  lll keep out of the way answered
wolfert dryly i can afford to take
the chance in a game like this

 but thedore was finding flaws
vilas he said will drop you when
he finds out you put on this show it
means the end of his arrangement with
big lafe

 whos to tell him i put on the
show demanded wolfert ill ex-
plain to him some other outfit cut in
on us no ill do better ill tell him
some of your outfit double-crossed us
that will finish the vilas-mcmurtree
agreement right there

 how about your own particular
crew of bunch-jumpers

 they never did know vilas was in
this rustling all they know is that im
running an independent game they

wont talk they cant afford to i spent
a lot of time pickin those jugheads
there aint a hand in the bunch that
dares pull out-hed never get clear
so youre fixed to go through with
this

  were fixed to go through with it
amended wolfert

  reno suffered a tremendous desire
to move his cramped arms the sun
burned his skin and the dust bit at if
his throat stuck and he had to throw
all his will against the impulse to
cough his gun had been taken-that
much he knew from the lack of weight
on his right hip yet occupied as he
was by the physical torment he fol-
lowed each mans talk with a puzzled
attention it was clear enough that they
were in partnership for some design
of their own what he could not arrive
at was the nature of the design

  thedore was talking again with a
reluctance that at once stamped him as
the weaker of the two it was he that
held back and offered objections while
wolfert relentlessly argued them
aside

  theres two men youll never fool
said thedore this reno-

  ill take care of him cut in wol-
fert

  and big lafe added thedore
big lafe is too smart not to guess
what its all about

  then you take care of him

  not so fast protested thedore i
can swing the outfit against him i can
take the authority away from him any
time i want theyll listen to me when
i say lets go wipe out the desert i
can do that but i cant frame big lafe
and draw on him youve got to re-
member all those boys have got a little
of lafes family blood in them they
wouldnt stand for it a minute


all western

  then said wolfert with a grunt
of finality ill take care of him
how

  leave that to me but were ready
to go on to the next stage of the game
you go back to the ranch talk the out-
fit up to the killin point tomorrow
night go down and raid blackrock rip
it to pieces and draw back home again
that shouldnt be so hard tomorrows
tuesday and therell be few punchers
in town but the attack will put every
prairie rancher on the warpath theyll
organize and bring a party up to at-
tack mcmurtree then the ball is open
my friend-high wide and handsome
and while all this is going on therell
be damned few hands watching the
stock on the range ill have my boys
comb it clean aint that simple
enough the mcmurtrees will get the
blame for doing it you and i will clean
up a young fortune

  while the scrap lasts grumbled
thedore

  it will last a long time the last
war went on for two years thats
where vilas made his money nibbled
off the cattle from the ranches which
were too busy fighting to watch their
own business

  at that instant reno-saw the whole
thing clearly he wondered at his own
failure in not understanding it before
during a range war all bars were
down anything could happen as hale
wolfert meant should happen now
but again thedore was arguing

  im to lead these fellows into black-
rock

  youve got to take a chance once in
a while pointed out wolfert impa-
tiently what ails you all you do is
keep the mcmurtrees scrapping and
running i do the rest you get your
profits out of me that aint the whole

story either when this thing is finish-
ed we may have the prairie outfits
ready to make a dicker for peace thir-
ty men you want to realize can run a
whole county ragged well if it works
out that way youll be the king pin in
the hills big lafe will be dead or hell
have no more authority over his men
point is keep the lads whipped up
theyre a hard bunch and they like to
fight

  weve done enough palaverin
its settled then tomorrow night
you ride

 yeah agreed thedore with no
great enthusiasm but weve got to
do something about reno

 reno went cold he heard the two
approach boots scuffing the soft dirt
one of them walked around the other
stood in back through the narrow slit
of his eyelids he saw a pair of legs
within reach of his arms and he knew
then what he would do it was a thin
chance but all that he had

  get it over with said thedore
nervously me i dont care for cold
turkey

  there was a long pause wolfert be-
hind wasnt moving and there was no
sound of an arm reaching for a gun
renos nerves were like threads of ice
and he set his mind for the outward
lunge that was to bring thedore down
by the heels then he heard wolfert
saying reflectively

  no-o i got a better idea ill take
him along he may be a help to me
reno relaxing was not prepared for
what followed wolfert let out a grunt
and struck with his boot catching
reno in the small of the back

  you snapped wolfert come out
of it

  renos head rolled and he dug the
nails of his fingers deep into his palms
the feudists



  to hold himself from springing up he
  opened his eyes staring directly into
  wolferts lowered face

    get up said vilass foreman

    reno pulled himself to his knees
  staggered to his feet a gray blur
  passed across the day and he thought
  he was falling wolfert seized him and
  shook him about with a vindictive
  pleasure

    come out of it-youre lucky to be
  here ive had two chances at you and
  didnt take em if you ever get out of
  this reno youll maybe learn a little
  something about deliverin messages
  thedore swung around and walked
  off to his horse too much talk wol-
  fert he said over his shoulder and
  then climbed to the saddle a moment
  later he vanished around the bend
  get aboard said vilass foreman

  i dont know murmured reno ten-
  tatively what this is all about but-
  wolferts broad and challenging face
  hardened he rapped out swiftly oh

	yes you do you know damned well
  what its about

    reno let the talk drop a sweeping
 reaction took hold of him and the ache
i in his head ran through his muscles
leaving him faint and dispirited it was
a real effort to get into the saddle and
wheel around at wolferts gesture he
crossed the glade passed between the
great pines and presently hit a shad-
j owed trail that looped downward
i thus by degrees they descended from
the hill country proper and entered the
more open folds of the bench going
over a meadow marked by sagging rail
fences they entered a thicket of wil-
lows forded a shallow creek sparkling
with sunlight and then pushed into a
wider and more gentle clearing stud-
ded by the gray unpainted benton
houses there seemed to be no life

about these but when they drew
abreast of the porch of the main house
a thin-figured little man appeared and
stood attentively by

  put him in the back bedroom said
wolfert

  reno walked through the doorway
he did not pause in the shattered
front room but instead went on along
a hall to its end and turned to the left
and through another doorway when
he swung around he found the little
man studying him with a roused curi-
osity

  seem to know your way about
said the fellow

  reno only shrugged his shoulders
yet he realized he had made a mistake
the little man opened his mouth to
speak changed his mind and closed
the door reno stood a long while in
the center of the room hearing the
other walk back to the front of the
place meanwhile his eyes traveled
from wall to wall from the scarred
floor to the water-stained ceiling and
his features darkened and grew more
embittered here in bygone years he
had lived and slept- and played as a
child this ruin now staring him in the
face hit him hard it was the last out-
rage the final bit of desolation and
sacrilege there was a shapeless bunk
in one corner and a rat-eaten mattress
on it he lay on it full length face
downward

  he fell asleep never realizing how
greatly the wear and tear of the recent
hours had drained his vitality when
he awoke it was with a quick tensing
of muscles with a sudden shock the
room was full of shadows and there
was the sound of many men talking in
the front part of the house turning
half over he saw the little man
crouched beside the bed a queer cat-


all western

like look of absorption on the thin and
evil cheeks at renos abrupt rise the
little man swung alertly back

  brother said he admiringly you
sure let the cares of the world go to
hell i couldve shot a cannon over you
unbeknownst feel some better

  reno was astonished at the change
in himself he had come to this room
miserable in mind and body standing
erect now he felt the old freshness of
spirit course through him like fire he
was sharp-witted again full of hope
sure of himself but all he said to the
little man was what time is it

  toward evenin said the little
man not that it should make any dif-
ference to you youre wanted out
front

  reno went through the door and
down the hall the little man followed
with a covert warning mind rour
talk wolferts on the prod then
reno came into the front room and
paused to find himself bracketed by
the eyes of eight or ten of the hardest
most lawless faces he had ever seen

  a fire burned in a sheet-iron stove
and a lantern on a center table threw
out an uneven light only half touch-
ing those figures posted around the
walls the talk ceased instantly a
treacherous silence rushed across the
room reno reaching for his tobacco
saw them stiffen saw their cheeks take
on a smooth expressionless mask it
was as if he had challenged them by
his appearance certainly they were on
guard running his own glance
around reno saw wolfert in a remote
corner wolfert finding himself spot-
ted suddenly broke the spell

  well-anybody ever see this man
before

  silence came again increasingly
weighted with sullen antagonism

reno feeling the weight of it lit a
match to his cigarette

  skinny-you ever see him before

  the little man who had acted as mes-
senger came from behind reno slowly
shaking his head no hale i aint
ever

 another hand broke in if hes
somebody we had ought to know who
is he

  but wolfert walked to the center of
the room

  nobody he rapped out ive got
to ride this fellow goes with me
skinny get his horse put out that fire
and put out the lamp everybody stay
close at hand till i get back keep
ridin the edges of this clearin but
dont let me catch any of you strayin
beyond bounds hear that and if
theres any smell of trouble up in the
trees dont go after it drift away to
shelter and wait

           chapter eight
           golden horns

no followed out glad
to be away from that
room he swung up
fell in beside wolfert
and matched the oth-
ers easy canter across
the clearing through
another belt of trees
they came to the crest of the bench
and saw all the vast prairie below fad-
ing beneath the dark over in the west
blackrocks lights began to glitter and
wink

  reno except for one thing youd
never have left that house again im
tellin you that bear it in mind be-
cause youve got to play with me the
next couple of hours or ill smash you
in your tracks
the feudists



   what seems to be your trouble
  now reno asked dryly

    vilas wants to see me-and you
  me how does he know im in your
  hands

    wolferts answer came back with a
  throaty savageness id like to know
  that myself the facts got to him and
  he wants to see you now listen to this
  youre going to keep your mouth shut
  answer his questions but under no
  consideration offer any free informa-
  tion get the idea

     i get the idea

thought you would replied wol-
fert youre nobodys fool and im not
deceivin myself about what youve
picked up the last twenty-four hours
i aint askin how much youve stowed
away under your hat i dont give a
 damn nor will i tell you how to han-
 die yourself in front of the questions
vilas shoots at you i dont know what
r hes got in his system either take
care of yourself the best you can
youre coachin me reflected reno
as if i was on your side of the fence
you know better wolfert why should
i do a string of lyin for you

    make a break in front of him
  promised wolfert and ill see you
  dead

    might be a hitch in that

    wait a minute interposed wol-
  fert theres another angle to it i
  happen to know that youre playin
  your own game too

    maybe admitted reno but thats
  got nothing to do with you

    yes it has i tell you you be rea-
  sonable with me and i can put you on
  to something you want to know a
  promise

r i wouldnt tie up with you for a
  million dollars grunted reno not
  with your brand of crookedness

  he thought he had stretched his luck
pretty far but wolfert seemed strange-
ly anxious over the coming interview
and remained insistently mild

  not askin you to tie up with me
the deal is only to cover what happens
in front of vilas your promise dont
hold beyond that i can get along with-
out you afterward as far as im con-
cerned ill be through with you and
youll be through with me

  free to play hide-and-run again
that it queried reno

  just so

  it was an ironic thought reno
chuckled

  your friend thedore would thank
you for the dicker wolfert

  never mind cut in wolfert ill
handle that

  youre pretty sure of yourself
said reno but its a bet

  good in front of vilas ill do all the
talking you stick to yes and no an-
swers and heres the one thing i dont
want vilas to know-that im friendly
with thedore you were in that scrap
last night all right remember that it
was the mcmurtree boys who started
the shootin

  agreed

  heres my part of the bargain
wolfert said abruptly you ask vilas
what time it is

  whats that demanded reno

  but wolfert had no more to offer
he shut up like a trap and spurred
away at a faster clip reno in the rear
experienced an odd sensation in his
brain something long ago forgotten
moved out of memorys grave and was
alive again he swore under his breath
at his failure to grasp it laid the tip of
his rowels across the ponys flanks
and shot on

  the compact with wolfert stung his


all western

pride even though it had been made
at the point of force it belittled him to
himself and made the future even
more complicated the whole affair
was increasingly tangled with the
soiled threads of deceit and greed and
evil he stood at a point from which he
might survey the uneasy relations of
all these men in the worst light wol-
fert the strongest and the most brazen
mirrored the rest in his ruthless and
contemptuous attitude of dog-eat-dog
reno had no illusions concerning the
man wolfert was now using him
when his usefulness was ended wol-
fert would end him

  blackrocks lights stretched out on
the desert to meet them and the out-
lines of the houses broke through the
desert shadow wolfert circled about
the town and advanced on its southern
side dismounting in the gloom of an
abandoned shed he waited for reno to
come along of a sudden his voice was
metallic and domineering

  by god reno you go through with
this

  ill carry the interview through
said reno indifferently after that
wolfert ill be looking out for myself

  wolfert let out a gusty breath and
said all right come on

  he walked straight into the blank-
ness of the building shadows and reno
felt a touch of surprise at the big fel-
lows lightness of step wolferts
knuckles tapped gently on a wall a
door opened on a rectangular yellow
glow pete vilass tall frame strode
across the light and vanished then
wolfert went in and reno followed
closing the door behind this was again
the room behind the saloon bar vilas
stood in a corner of it his yankee face
shrewdly non-committally set

 hal where did you get reno

 found him scoutin the country
this morning wolfert said cautiously
so i took him to camp

 why

  i told you the other night i dont
trust him who told you i got him
but the foremans question failed to
be casual a deep sulky resentment
was in it vilas grinned

  youd like to know that wouldnt
you didnt figure i had my ears cock-
ed that far up in the hills well what
happened

  wolfert eyed vilas with a dull re-
gard trouble the mcmurtrees are
gettin ambitious when we come to
get the beef they shot us off the slope
thats the end of that business pete
mcmurtree started the shooting
broke out vilas all his features grow-
ing pinched mcmurtree did

  yeah i told you that game couldnt
last

  vilas said explosively what took
you so long in cornin to tell me

  ive been all day roundin up the
boys they were scattered all over the
map the mcmurtrees aint quit look-
in for us yet

  vilas had no immediate answer but
he kept staring at wolfert until the
latters dark face changed

  what are you goin to do about it
demanded wolfert sit and take it
or go clean that country out

 leave that to me said vilas
what was your idea about reno
to keep him where id have my
eyes on him grumbled wolfert i
dont trust him you want him roam-
ing around the country knowin what
he does

 depends on what he knows an-
swered vilas wolfert go out front
and bring george here

  wolfert went to the inner door he
the feudists



 was opening it when something oc-
 curred to him he looked back swiftly
 whats that for

    im going to start the ball rolling
  get george

   wolfert nodded and went on closing
 the door behind almost instantly
 vilas turned on his heel and walked
 to the little table in the room he
 pulled out a drawer took a forty-five
 from within and shoved it across the
 tables top

   thats yours reno

reno reached for it puzzled then
his hand snapped back and his eyes
hardened against that gun the butt of
 which held a star and crescent of
pearl this was the weapon he had
 taken from the dying two-bits

   where did you get that he de-
 manded

recognize it do you drawled vi-
i las thought you would never mind
how i got it shove it in your holster
renos mind gripped fast to a grow-
t ing suspicion-that he was being
framed deliberately he pulled away
x from the thought knowing that it
made no difference the possession of
a gun answered all arguments his
fingers closed about the butt he
snapped open the cylinder satisfied
himself as to the loads and shook the
cylinder into its seat vilass face had
changed again and now carried a look
 of bitter purpose about it all the sur-
face show of good humor had gone
 reno dropped the gun to his holster
what for he asked

   you know what wolfert wouldve
 done to you

    yes

   well heres your answer when he
 comes back its your say-so

    vilas said reno ive run a lot of
  errands lately but i draw the line on

hiring out as a killer hes your fore-
man not mine

  never mind when he sees youve
got a gun-

  lost your faith in him vilas

  i was wondering how long it would
take him to figure out his trick said
vilas

  ive got a message for you reno
said mcmurtree told me to ask you to
draw out of this mess he cant stop
his men from raising hell maybe you
can stop yours

  one of wolferts boys fired the first
shot

  all of wolferts boys fired first
amended reno dryly

  i thought so well theyll never be
stopped till wolferts stopped

  he was studying reno with a slant-
ing shrewdness his own secretive pur-
poses lending a hooded quality to the
brilliance of the sharp eyes-returning
the stare reno understood he was be-
ing played for a puppet again he
thought then of another thing back-
ing to a far corner he took a stand
what time is it vilas

  toward nine said vilas and reach-
ed for his watch

  the movement of his arm pushed
aside his coat front exposing the
heavy length of chain looped through
a vest button hole and caught there by
a crossbar of gold made in the form of
a steers horns tipping the watch in
his palm he announced the time
half past nine why

  reno started to speak the words
as dry as crackling paper vilas
youre-

  but he was cut off by the opening of
the door wolfert came in alone closed
the portal behind him

  george is down the street some-
where he explained straightening


all western

around he looked first at vilas saw
something in the old mans face and
whirled his big body flat against the
wall his attention flashed to reno he
saw the gun and his cheeks went pale

  hale said vilas with a slurred
softness youre a cheap crook and
never did own brains enough to fool
me ive called you

  wolfert said slowly youve walked
into your own trap pete look close at
that man he was a little kid when you
saw him last before he came back
here i recognized him and you didnt
why you damned fool theres the son
of hi benton come back to find out
who shot and killed his dad sixteen
years ago youre smart pete yeah
very smart hes lookin at you

chapter nine
the end of a man

cked against the
wall the man who had
been jim reno now
became jim benton in
one sweep of chang-
ing circumstances all
the old fences he had
built up around jim
benton all the safeguards and screens
with which he had hidden that man
fell away

  something inside him brimmed over
during that fractional minute of be-
trayal the even balance of his mind
tipped and the last dissenting scruple
at bloodshed died there in the hushed
suspense that began to grow intoler-
able he had sworn to himself that he
would never resume his true identity
until he had found the killer of his
father and here and now that purpose
was apparently fulfilled no reason
was left for carrying on the false

name and he saw that even if he
wished to continue as reno he could
not he stood exposed to these two
people and presently would be ex-
posed to all the desert and all the hills

  the energy of his body flooded along
his arms and into his brain-and left
the rest of his muscles inert and help-
less in effect he became a machine of
destruction set on trigger tension
waiting for the impulse that would re-
lease the dammed-up rage and drive
him into gunplay for it was clear to
him now that this pair could never af-
ford to let him go whatever their own
quarrels they would unite in an effort
to get him

  wolfert seemed actually at ease as
if he enjoyed watching vilas suffer
there was no doubt of the cattlemans
shock the sly sharp features went
pallid the nut-shaped head sagged
and the scheming eyes flashed out with
wildness akin to the desperation of a
trapped beast then he made the effort
of pulling himself together straight-
ening he said thickly

  youre hi bentons kid

  yes droned benton im the ben-
ton kid that drove out of the country
sixteen years ago with his mother in
a borrowed wagon and ten dollars of
charity money

  vilas said something strange hows
that mother of yours i always won-
dered about her poor soul

  she died six months ago thats
why im here youve had a long
breathing spell vilas but its over
now

  look here boy said vilas a little
more sure of himself why talk that
way to me im the man that lent your
mother the wagon and the ten dollars
youre barkin up the wrong tree
what time is it vilas demanded
the feudists



benton

  vilas started to reach for his watch
then went rigid again one finger
hooked around the chain what in
hell-

  that gold longhorn charm you car-
ry said benton evenly belonged to
my dad youre pretty raw vilas must
be fifty people around blackrock who
know about that charm

  wolfert broke in sardonically but
not fifty people that gave a damn what
happened to hi benton my friend or
could afford to take issue with pete
here even if they did care anyhow
pete always was fond of souvenirs he
gave you another souvenir-which is
that gun two-bits owned

 wait a minute wait a minute
pleaded vilas if its the charm thats
worryin you benton i can damn soon
explain it i bought it off a puncher
five years ago

  bought two-bitss gun also i reck-
on queried wolfert more and more
jeering you dont lie well pete be-
cause you never had to practice the
trick

  vilas almost shook his fist at wol-
fert you know where that gun came
from you hound you stole it from
bentons saddlebags the other night
and brought it here

  what should i steal it for rapped
out wolfert

 maybe you like to collect your
scalps cried vilas dont pull the
wool over my eyes  can guess who
killed two-bits and i can guess why
wolferts single word was flat and
toneless why

  to rile the mcmurtrees bring on
the war again and feather your own
nest said vilas i told you there
wasnt an idea in your head i couldnt
read

  youve got benton to answer now
said wolfert

  they turned on him and benton saw
the anger and the heat go out of their
faces replaced by a dragging worry
the oppressive silence came again and
he could feel the weight of their
thoughts a moment ago the issue had
been clear-cut and his own decision
made now he was not so sure of
vilass guilt vilas shifted on his feet
and carefully raised a hand to wipe a
damp forehead shrewdness sprang
gleaming into his eyes again and he
began talking in a smooth persuasive
manner

  look here benton use your own
judgment ive played this game a good
many years and never made an error
i hire men to do my chores i dont do
em myself all those hands working
for wolfert are really working for me
wolferts fetched and carried going on
twenty years figure that out i never
killed your dad hed been busted soon
enough which was ail i wanted but
wolfert got to thinking that the easiest
way was to knock him over wolfert
did that

  wolferts swarthy features showed
a plain cruelty but he held his temper
back youre carryin that watch
charm pete not me he said

take it or leave it said vilas di-
recting his words at benton now
what are you going to do about it
where is your gun asked benton
the cattlemans answer raced back
across the room i dont carry a gun
benton swung his attention to wol-
fert then it seems to be you and
me he said grimly

  wolferts shoulders rolled forward
and he visibly settled whats that
mean you want to call the number
right now


all western

  benton shook his head not this
time ill pick my own ground when
we go to the smoke wolfert ill see
you in the hills im getting out of
blackrock-now

  but wolferts manner shifted and
the blocky jaws came together stub-
bornly no

  you want it here

  right here grunted wolfert and
cast a quick side glance at vilas

  vilas got that warning and his reply
was to turn himself more squarely to-
ward benton at the same time he took
a backward step placing wolfert so
much the more distant from him and
as he did so benton realized the cattle-
man had lied about possessing a gun
both of them were going for him

  all right benton said evenly let
er rip

  im out of it called vilas

  you lie retorted benton youve
got a gun under your left armpit
wolfert looked as if he was about to
spring his heavy lips were thinned
against each other and a pale streak
deepened on either side of his nose
call it he rasped

  your party benton told him

  im out of it shouted vilas and
deliberately turned his back to ben-
ton he had weakened at the last mo-
ment wolfert started to curse his el-
bows crawled higher and the fingers
of his right hand began to spread
apart but benton was watching the
mans eyes and he saw something in
them that defined the next step for
him he said

  im going to slide to the back door
and go out of it wolfert 

 youll never touch that knob
warned the vilas foreman i-
whats that cried vilas making a
full turn

  a tray had fallen in the saloon with
a banging noise and a table went over
somebody shouted the east end of
the street at the top of his voice
after that those in the saloon stam-
peded for the front door

  there was a shot a lone shot that
sent a flat echo across town and then
benton heard the rush and pound of
horsemen storming into blackrock
the saloon building shook with the
reverberation a mans boots made a
clatter through the now deserted bar-
room and in another moment the in-
tervening door was knocked open to
show a lithe young man paused breath-
less on the threshold he had no hat
and the color of excitement stained his
neck a turkey red

  vilas-hey vilas its the mcmur-
trees i saw em a quarter mile down
the road

  the rest of his talk was overwhelm-
ed by a long blast of gunfire without
trying to finish his warning the young
man threw himself violently about and
raced away wolferts head rose from
its fixed position and benton saw the
fellows eyes mirror astonishment

  why said wolfert i told the-
dore tomorrow night-not tonight

  vilas looked at the foreman only
looked then his turning arm came
against the table lamp and swept it to
the floor it happened so rapidly that
bentons reactions were delayed the
light went out or seemed to at any
rate the room turned dark relieved
only by the glow coming in from the
barroom

  vilas yelled you everlastin fool
and sprang through that door at the
same moment benton dropped to all
fours

  two things happened at once the
room throbbed with the roar of wol-
the feudists



ferts gun and the smashed lamp
caught fire the flame rising and racing
along the path of the spilled oil as he
fell benton dragged the table with him
for shelter but this fresh light in the
room laid him wide open and he had
no choice of chances wolferts bullets
went high screaming through the
flimsy walls beyond and then the gen-
eral crash and batter of the mcmurtree
attack drowned out all else

   righting himself benton came up
 from behind the table with his own
 weapon blasting a cover for him but
 he had no need of it wolfert was gone
 he had retreated into the barroom

   benton made no more mistakes
 reaching behind he opened the rear
 door and stepped into the dark turning
 the next instant to hurdle all the junk
 piles on the back side of the town he
 got to the horses took his own by the
 bridle and led it away paralleling the
 buildings a hundred yards to the east
 of the saloon he left the pony with
  reins grounded and went up an alley
 at full run at the street he halted and
 crouched in the shadows a spectator
 watching the storm

there was no doubt of the fighting
rage of the mcmurtrees their first at-
tack had carried them all through the
i street and out the far end they came
 back now at a rush massed two and
two firing to either side window glass
i fell on porch top and sidewalk like
jangling rain the whine of lead rip-
j ping across the soft walls rose higher
 from his covert benton saw light aft-

	er light go out

j the mcmurtrees were shouting from
 point to point emptying the street

they abandoned their compact ar-
j rangement-benton guessed they were
feeling the tide go with them-and be-
gan to cut through the alleys in pairs

to ride into the stores the taint of
burned powder drifted along the dark
muzzle flashes made weird glows
once he thought he saw thedore in
the mad tangle but a second glimpse
revealed just another mcmurtree

  meanwhile blackrock began to ral-
ly the opposition strengthened and
appeared to collect at the saloon a mc-
murtree fell out of the saddle in pass-
ing that point another hill mans
horse dropped from beneath him see-
ing that the mcmurtrees began to
draw back into the deeper darkness
benton thought they had enough and
were retreating	f

 the same thought moved a few of
the blackrock citizens into the street
again but it was a mistake the mc-
murtrees hurled themselves into the
semi-light once more the head of the
column going like the point of a spear
toward the saloon the volleys blazed
and crackled and then there was a re-
sounding smash of horseflesh and
wood as the mcmurtrees struck the sa-
loon at window and door and literally
broke through benton absolutely
stuck to his tracks shook an aston-
ished head he had never seen men
battle like this before

  must be years of heartburn behind
that he muttered

  he saw now casting a glance farther
into the shadows a lank figure rise
from an alley and begin to throw bul-
lets into that struggling mass by the
saloon presently this man walked
boldly into the street refilling his gun
as he crossed a beam of light he stood
identified pete vilas coolly taking up
the scrap vilas snapped his cylinder
shut and raised his gun with an amaz-
ing coldness of nerve benton did not
hear the shot drowned as it was by the
torrent of sound all about him but he


all western

did see the gun kick back in the old
mans fist and he also saw the nut-
shaped head nod as if in approval
vilas tried again stepped back a few
paces seemed to see some better
chance and pivoted to lay his sights
down an alley

 but he never dropped the hammer
on another cartridge a gun cracked
near at hand at bentons right and
vilas raising his face to the star-
flecked sky above him fell limply
without a gesture benton recoiled and
glanced quickly along his side of the
street he saw hale wolfert rise from
his knees from beside the stable water
trough and cut over the dust the next
moment he was out of sight

  that warned benton as no other in-
cident could havedone he was be-
tween fires in an alien town that was
attacked by men hostile to him there
was nothing left here for him to do
the next move was back to the hills
back to the mcmurtree house before
the crew got there he retreated to the
rear of the alley got to his horse and
climbed into the saddle

 five minutes later he was a mile
away from blackrock aiming for the
bench from that position he turned
to see a long fan-shaped flare of yellow
light sweep skyward blackrock was
burning

  and that is the end of big lafes
hope of peace benton said to him-
self every man on the prairie will
line up to raid the hills and get even
here comes the war and thats exact-
ly what thedore and wolfert want to
see but i wonder why thedore
jumped the attack on blackrock up a
day disregarding wolferts instruc-
tions scowling at the long black out-
line of the hills before him he con-
cluded ive about come to the end of

the drifting stage its time to make a
stand for myself and let other people
take care of their own business

chapter ten
the flame spreads

 the high point of
the bench he paused
to survey blackrock
once again-a great
shield of light spread-
ing against the vel-
vet opaqueness of the
prairie and the hori-
zon the town was lost it would be
nothing but hot ashes by break of day
an insult offered by the mcmurtrees
for all the past injuries done them-
and an insult that would draw the
prairies answer before the passing of
another forty-eight hours looking
steadily at the mark of ruin there
benton saw what he had been partic-
ularly seeking the mcmurtree outfit
traveling at no great speed came along
the lane of light made by the fire
bound back for the hills there was as
clearly as he could make out no party
of townsmen following

  he was a half hour in the lead and
continuing the climb he set a pace in-
tended to increase that advantage he
came to the plank bridge began a
sightless exploration for the lesser
trail found it and after two hours or
better from blackrock rode into the
mcmurtree meadow and heard the
hound pack come baying forward

  the door of the big house opened
immediately drawing abreast of the
porch he saw the girl framed there
her face darkly shadowed

  who is il

  me said benton and got down

  a quick expulsion of breath an-
the feudists



swered him rae mcmurtree turned
half about and revealed a graven wor-
ry she said rapidly come in-come
in jim

   when he passed through she closed
 and bolted the door in this great room
 the scene never appeared to change
 the fireplace rolled out its grateful
 heat and big lafe stood with his back
 to it jim benton went over observing
 how the recent hours had aged this old
 man heavy lines ran down the fine
 face and a shadow that seemed fixed
 beyond any erasure hovered across his
 strong eyes his chin came up but he
 said nothing at the moment only
 watched benton with a manner that
 was full of questioning rae mcmurtree
 came between the two men

   i told you she said hed come
 back there was pride in the words

   you saw vilas asked big lafe
 showing anxiety

   yes but it will do you no good

   he refused

   benton shook his head hes dead

   big lafe stood very still accepting

	the news with a deeper show of strain

   your boys went on benton hit
 blackrock like a ton of dynamite and
 wrecked the town its burning now
 that ought to be some satisfaction to
 you no matter what the conse-
 quences

   were lost muttered big lafe
 absolutely lost the prairie will
 never let that go by itll wipe us out
 my outfit killed vilas

   no said benton thinking it odd
 how his talk echoed and died in the
 barrenness of the room the fire sil-
 houetted the girl beside him she was
 watching him closely no no mcmur-
 tree got vilas his own man wolfert
 shot and killed him from behind

   wolfert

  it should be clear enough to you
now what part wolfert plays in this
mess hes high man

  why grunted big lafe hes kill-
ed the golden goose he made a profit
out of pete vilas every time i turned
over a herd to him

  he intends to make more profit
with vilas out of the way look here
at the time you met him last night in
the meadow he had it all arranged his
own bunch of rawhiders were right
behind him those were the gentle-
men that opened up on you it was his
scheme dont you see it

  he wants a war

  hes made one amended benton
and while the hill and the desert are
tied up in a dog fight hell go out and
rustle the range as he pleases wholl
get the blame for the stock stealing
you will

  and thedore fell for it growled
big lafe i tried to hush the boys
they would have nothing to do with
me it was thedore who cried trouble
and took em down there tonight blast
the man ive got to put on my gun
and settle this for a last time

  he fell for nothing contradicted
benton

  he was silent for a moment feeling
the attention of the girl and big lafe
riveted to him but there was some-
thing more happening in the stillness
of this moment these people were
leaning on him they were uncon-
sciously placing the little hope they
had into his keeping he was aware of
it with a sort of strengthening fire of
energy it changed his outlook stif-
fened him

  i wouldnt say this he went on
except that i seem to be one of the
paities of the first part now thedores
got his irons in the fire too


all western

 big lafes reply was a halting in-
clination of his head the girl how-
ever vented a quick exclamation i
knew it	

  when i left here added benton
i walked right into wolfertand the-
dore holding a directors meeting near
the benton place they creased me i
overheard a lot of talk while they
thought i was out thedore is using
the mcmurtree boys to keep the fight
boiling wolfert suggested the raid on
blackrock thedore agreed its plain
that thedores all the same as a wol-
fert hand

   instead of lifting big lafe to a rage
the news strangely depressed him his
tall frame lost its stiffness and his
shoulders drooped forward

  i wish he said slowly i could
make the boys see that but it will
never stick reno im an old man im
finished

  while were on the subject put in
benton my name is not reno i am
hi bentons son i went away from
here sixteen years ago as a little heart-
broken kid but i never forgot the
tragedy that did away with my dad
and aged my mother im back now to
find out who killed the old man

  big lafes body straightened a
great fire of surging emotions poured
from the drill-straight eyes at once re-
lentless and probing after a long in-
terval he said coldly i ought to order
you away hi benton was no friend of
mine

   since you were in the habit of raid-
ing his range when you chose jim
benton answered sharply why should
he have been your friend

  big lafe nodded and held his tongue
it was fie girl who answered

  all that is over and were sorry
though that is poor consolation now

but-have you found out it was not a
mcmurtree that killed your father
yes

  what in the devils name big lafe
growled showing something of his old
domineering manner are you doing
here youve got no reason to put in
your gun with us it aint reasonable
whats the answer

 benton was watching the girl
watching the light of the fire stream
across her face and shift its expres-
sion her lips moved her hand rose
slowly along the rough woolen shirt
she wore and paused at the exposed
white throat color stained her cheeks
benton suddenly looked away stirred
by odd impulses the girl said calmly
never mind his reason dad it may
be a good one i told you i trusted him
i do now-niore than before

  big lafe came out of his rigid pos-
ture attention running across the
room theyre returning he warned
benton help yourself im not able
to help you

  your horse exclaimed rae and
then ran across the room and hurried
into the yard

  benton stepped slowly backward and
paused against the kitchen door hear-
ing the cavalcade drum along the
meadow voices rough and impatient
struck through the walls of the house
somebody shouted a name somebody
else said therell be a guard around
this clearin tonight

  then the girl gasping and with her
eyes ablaze with excitement came up
behind benton through the kitchen
boots tramped over the porch

  i led your pony to the woodshefl
whispered rae mcmurtree what else
do you want me to do

  ill take a hand murmured ben-
ton and backed into the kitchen the
the feudists	

girl touching him briefly on the shoul-
der passed on closing the door but
benton crouched against its kitchen
side opened it again half an inch or
so and thus saw the mcmurtree crew
stamp in from the night full of swag-
ger and hard temper

  thedore was foremost his sinister
face sought out big lafe and a queer
suppressed pleasure showed itself in
the foremans half smile he stopped
in front of the old man

  ive done what should have been
done years ago he said insolently
you only talked about doin it lafe
make up your mind to it-im boss
here now ill take charge of the mc-
murtree affairs these lads want more
than an old mans pipe-dreamin
youre through

  big lafe answered with a voice that
was choked and trembling thedore
what have you done to my boys damn
your black heart what have you done
to them wheres the others wheres
the other twelve lads

 benton measured the mcmurtree
ranks with a close interest he counted
nineteen hands in that party suddenly
realizing that it had been badly
handled in the fight only twenty-four
hours previous the outfit had filled the
hall now it stood shrunken in the
lamplight blackrock had taken toll

 i have managed this family for
twenty years went on big lafe al-
most shouting for twenty years
and i never led it to slaughter
youve got to fight fire with fire
grumbled thedore not quite so forth-
right in his manner

  you whelp shouted big lafe its
mcmurtree blood youre spillin-not
yours

  blackrock defended thedore is
wiped off the earth

                                      r

  what of it that wont help the
lads lyin dead and deserted down
there

  lafe broke in another man sar-
donically youve lost your grip on
yourself if wed hit back twenty jears
ago like we hit back tonight maybe
wed be out there as kings of the coun-
try instead of spendin all this time
dodgin through the trees well weve
made a start quit raggin thedore

  thedore stared at big lafe with an
ironic gleam theres your answer
he grunted now lets have no more
squawkin

  benton heard big lafes breath rush
into the stillness of the room turning
benton went across the kitchen on the
balls of his feet and out the back way
pausing a moment he scouted the
yard and saw none of the mcmurtree
hands moving around all of them evi-
dently were inside and taking part in
the showdown thus reassured ben-
ton crawled along the house wall until
he arrived at the front porch

  time to do something on my own
account benton told himself quietly
and pushed the door open

  thedore was talking and the unnec-
essary strength of his words cloaked
the smaller sounds of bentons en-
trance he closed the door behind him
and stepped sidewise alertly watching
the row of backs presented to him
only big lafe and the girl commanded
his entry but big lafe seemed not to
see him it was the girls eyes that
lifted touched him and fell swiftly
away

  thedore said therell be a guard
posted tonight lafe make no mistake
about it-the blackrock bunch will pay
us a visit ive got it worked out im
going to lay two big brush piles to
either side of the meadow and drench


all western

em with coal oil when that gang does
come stormin along ill have those
brush piles lighted theyll be caught
between the firelights

  benton lifted his gun wait a min-
ute he said quietly

  he was afraid of that first moment
of shock and astonishment-afraid
that these men might react to the in-
stants warning and knock him out of
his tracks as it was they came around
all at once and he thought he had lost
his battle then and there those lithe
bodies wheeled and swayed and he saw
arms drop lower and lower tense an-
tagonism clamped the dark-tanned fea-
tures into a common expression that
made each mcmurtree look increasing-
ly like the others one man-he was
only a boy-seized the butt of his re-
volver and half lifted it thedore shel-
tered where he stood called out
angrily

  get him-go on get him

  his words were overridden by big
lafes stentorian contradiction leave
him alone the man has done me a
favor 

  benton rode out the crisis with a
smooth cool drawl if i wasnt a
friend of you boys i wouldnt be here
why should i ride into certain grief
then whats that gun lifted for
yelled thedore

  i wasnt so sure of my reception
murmured benton

  get him cried thedore so roused
that his talk was thick and clumsy
hes the man that framed that trap-
and then ducked out of it

  wrong thedore argued benton
with the same relentless calm i
staged nothing and i didnt duck out
you lads rushed away from me ive
had a tough time finding my way
back

  whereve you been since dark last
night challenged thedore

  where would you suppose ben-
ton parried

  he looked straight into thedores
thin slashed face and he saw the sul-
len eyes widen and contract at that
benton knew he had breasted the first
dangerous wave of antagonism as for
the rest of the mcmurtree hands big
lafes long-maintained discipline seem-
ed still to have its effect they held
fast

  leave him alone repeated big
lafe he has done us a favor

  what favor grunted thedore
let him tell it said big lafe and
waved an arm gently at benton

  it was a clear signal that he had
done all he could and that from this
point on benton was the governor of
his own fortune seeing it thus benton
ventured a shift of position he moved
quietly around the group and toward
the fire keeping his back to the wall
when he stopped he was within fifteen
feet of thedore commanding the fore-
man more than that he had flanked
the other hands if they opened on him
now it meant a shifting and an interval
of confusion thedore got the meaning
of that immediately

 you dumb mugs-

  thedore broke in benton why
not leave well enough alone

  he had the foreman guessing the-
dores unlovely visage tightened still
more and he shifted his weight with-
out stepping out of his position still
casual benton allowed the muzzle of
his gun to drop it hung limp in his fist
while he tested his luck

  i saw the bonfire on the prairie
he remarked made a nice little blaze
where were you rapped out the-
dore
the feudists



  on top of the bench said benton
readily

  how- began thedore then he
stopped and scowled you spent a lot
of time foolin around he finished
gruffly

  and learned a lot of things the-
dore when did you decide to hit
blackrock

  for a considerable length of time
thedore delayed the answer appar-
ently reasoning out the question
weighing it

  what difference he finally said
would it make to you

  it was a day premature wasnt it
thedore got impatient didnt you
thedores muscles went tight he
swung into a visible crouch but he
disregarded the question it was one
of the mcmurtree hands who spoke up
puzzled

  hows that

  attack was tove been tomorrow
night explained benton negligently
who told you pressed the hand
benton ventured a brief side glance
at them and saw he had the complete
attention of the crew he drew a deep
breath pinning his eyes to thedore

  youve been badly fooled boys i
dont blame you for wiping blackrock
off the map but it aint your idea like
you think a cleverer head figured it
out-a fellow that wanted a roaring
good war started for his own profit
while the prairie is chasing you fel-
lows all over hells half acre hell be
out stripping the range-and you will
get the blame

  thedore relaxed thedore permit-
ted himself a flicker of a smile that
was wry and dangerous

  seem to have the confidence of this
fellow reno

  it was sort of forced on me

  here said the mcmurtree hand
lets get somewheres whos the
man

  hale wolfert

 and how shot out the hand
would you be wise to this

  when the fight began over the cat-
tle explained benton i drew out of
it wasnt my fight next day i started
down the slope and ran into a pair of
gentlemen seriously talkin shop i was
laid cold but i heard these two talk
plenty they arranged the attack for
tomorrow night one of those fellows
was wolfert-and he took me to his
camp i finally broke away and got
back here to meet the other man that
crook right there-thedore
thedores grin of cold fury grew i
thought youd mess up some such
story he sneered

  benton pressed on driving his point
home that cattle fight was staged
wolfert meant it as a starter

  yeah growled thedore you-
thedore was in on that also
snapped benton for proof of it
where was thedore when the shooting
began on the dead lope away from
the meadows that first bust of lead
found him away to the other side of
the battle you bet he knew he never
showed up till daylight the next morn-
ing

  who are you asked the mcmur-
tree hand with a clear show of
thoughtfulness

  jim benton son of old hi

  oh muttered the hand i begin-
sure mj own irons in the fire but
ive found the man that killed my old
man its no mcmurtrec and so ive
got no grudge against you but youre
playing the part of suckers you went
down to blackrock and you lost a lot of
men where was thedore during that


all western

scrap i didnt see him in the lead-
and i was in an alley watching pretty
close suckers-its the plain fact
that stung them and benton saw
that he had made a mistake he had
been too harsh the mcmurtree hand
turned slowly to thedore

  guess its up to you to answer this
dude thedore

  i can do it rasped thedore ben-
ton just drop that gun

  id as soon see you draw said ben-
ton evenly

  thedores eyebrows came farther
down he half drew a breath seemed
to hold it then he called sharply to
the crew

  spread across the room if he lifts
that gun-

  benton not daring to let thedore
get beyond the focus of his vision
heard the crew break reluctantly from
the compact huddle and obey the or-
der thedore had won

  now repeated thedore just drop
the gun and walk out of the door
something happened then that ben-
ton didnt quite grasp at first the girl
had apparently left the room a little
before she came running from the
kitchen now and her command was
like a dash of cold water

  no get out of here-all of you
march you fools thedore do you
want a load of buckshot

  it broke the tension and turned all
of them in her direction she stood be-
side the fireplace a double-barreled
shotgun lifted on her own people the-
dore swayed forward but big lafes
arm pushed him roughly back then
somebody cursed violently and wheel-
ed around in another moment they
were filing out to the porch stepping
backward to the wall benton trained
his gun on thedore

  you too he said softly

  thedore flung up his head youll
never leave this house he muttered
rae ill have something to say to you
later-when this is ironed out

  thedore went over the boards heels
dragging and left the place benton
waiting for that kicked the door shut
shot the bolt and sprang aside

  blow the light he called get
away from the fireplace outside he
could hear thedores harsh voice de-
nouncing him goading the men urg-
ing them to attacking positions

  it was the girl who whipped out the
lamps glow big lafe stood motion-
less muttering

  were no better off were worse
off should have taken their guns
we didnt have enough bulge on
em to work it said benton its one
thing at a time this was the best we
could do-this time

  part of the crew ran the length of
the porch heels making a clatter

  the girl said sharply dad get away
from that fire

  hide in my own house thundered
big lafe never i-

  the rest of his speech was over-
whelmed by the roar of a gun glass
clattered to the floor a high yelling
began to rise from outside big lafe
slowly turned put a hand to his chest
and bowed his head the firelight show-
ing the grim despair riding his fine
old face then he went down as if
fighting the collapse with every stub-
born fiber in him-went down on his
side and lay there

  the girl screamed dad

  its worse for you two mumbled
old lafe for me its better the re-
wards of a crooked life im glad to go
thisaway there honey stop the cry-
ing benton youll have-to get her
the feudists



away from here you cant hold out in
here never can get her away only
one man couldve-done this thedore
but he did me a favor anyhow stop
crying-

 posted in the darkest part of the
room benton saw the old man die
rae mcmurtree crouched over him
sobbing with a stifled agony that cut
into benton like a knife beyond the
house wall men were running again
and a call went from place to place
then a voice penetrated the boards

 get upstairs rae were goin to
blast benton to hell an gone

         chapter eleven
         into the shadows

i he fire on the hearth
was dying turning to
a dull blood glow
rae mcmurtree still
crouched on her knees
before big lafe but
she had stopped cry-
ing and he saw her
shoulders rigid y framed against the
dwindling light her head raised and
her eyes fixed on some point above the
mantel looking up there benton saw
the framed picture of a woman a wist-
ful middle-aged woman who seemed to
survey the room with a profound sad-
ness and wisdom benton guessed it to
be the girls mother

  the voice called again more peremp-
torily rae get upstairs get out of
the room and stay away from benton 

 come away said benton gently

 the girl got to her feet and came
over to him very slowly he was sur-
prised to find how contained her face
was as if she had exerted her will to
put the tragedy behind her it struck
him that suddenly she looked a great

deal like that older woman whose pic-
ture was on the mantel piece-sad yet
resolute and unafraid benton express-
ed the only reassurance he could find

  he was a tired man your dad
mighty tired and he said he was glad
to go this way id take his word for
that rae

  i believe it whispered the girl
then she raised her dark glance to
him the mcmurtree women have al-
ways gone through this jim always
have cried over men who died in vio-
lence disappointment and heartbreak
and a life of uncertainty in one wild
land or another before my mother
died she told me to expect it-to learn
to smile when there was nothing to
smile for there is a strain of lawless-
ness in the mcmurtree blood that noth-
ing will cure nothing but a bullet all
this-i knew it would come some day
but i never thought a mcmurtree
would ever die at the hands of his own
kind jim ive been a good soldier till
now never saying much because i un-
derstood how much my father wanted
peace to come but i can feel sorry no
longer for what happens to the boys
im all through with that

any brothers of yours out there
no the closest kin i have in that
yard is a second cousin the rest are
even less related thedore-he is no
relation at all

  i wanted to know said benton
gravely ive got to fight back itll
be your own people im throwing lead
at

  go ahead said the girl with a
quick surge of energy there is noth-
ing more i can do they are out to
destroy and be destroyed

its me or them benton added
wanting to make the point very clear
she lifted her eyes so that he could


all western

see them you ought to know by now
how i feel about that jim

 the brusque voice came again
were opening up at the count of ten
are you in the clear rae

  go upstairs whispered benton
ill follow in a minute

  be careful said rae mcmurtree
and held her position but benton
turned her about with his hands and
pushed her away waiting there in the
blackest corner of the hall he saw her
climb the stairs and pause at the head
of them at that benton moved he
cat-footed along the wall came beside
a window and crouched

  somebody outside said all set a
man farther off repeated it a moment
later a body leaped to the porch and
raced across it the man at the window
flung his cry high into the night

  all right

  it was the signal for a rising roar of
guns a rending sound of wood and the
tinkling of shattered glass all around
the room lead ripped the floor at ben-
tons feet lead whined and flattened
against the stones of the fireplace and
the embers of the fire leaped up as one
bullet and another tore into it benton
stiffened catching the silhouette of a
mcmurtree hand wavering outside the
window he lifted his revolver waited
with patience till he saw his target fair
and sure and then he fired that man
went down without uttering a word
but beyond a thick savage shout
broke through the detonations

  go after him-go after him smash
that door down before he kills anybody
else whats the matter with you yel-
low mugs

  that was thedore speaking from
shelter benton wheeled and ducked
away from his location he had been
spotted by some hand shooting

through another window and the slugs i
of that marksman rapped the flooring
right at his heels once more flattened
against the wall benton studied the
windows until he caught the muzzle
flash coming through one near the
front door he flred only once pivoted
again and raced up the stairs to the
gallery they were sledging in the door
with a heavy piece of timber

  jim whispered the girl wed
better try to get away the storeroom
roof leads off from my bedroom win-
dow

  no horses-no chance

  your horse is in the shed beyond
the storeroom

 the end of the timber crashed
through the panels of the door and
jammed there benton took a hand rest
on the gallery railing and put the last
three shells of his load into those
panels with a cold fury savagely
pleased he heard them yelling on the
porch the end of the timber skewed
upward as the outside part was drop-
ped and deserted a moment later a
fresher and more intsnse volley tore
through all the windows the girl laid
a hand on bentons shoulder while he
reloaded

  wed better try it she urged
theres no use trying to hold out
here theyll get in

  theyre in grunted benton and
leaned far over the rail to corrtmand
the kitchen doorway three men came
through it at once bodies dim in the
darkness of the room they literally
hurled themselves through jammed
together and firing as they entered
afterward they broke each man ad-
vancing on a different tangent sweep-
ing the shadows for the target as yet
undiscovered motionless for one brief
second benton watched at the same
the feudists



time hearing the front door grind on
its hinges again one arm moved the
girl backward out of range as the
other brought up the gun with a drag-
ging deliberation

 benton said up here boys and
let go

 the foremost hand almost at the
foot of the stairway emitted a great
gusty cry and snapped his weapon
around but benton pinned him in his
tracks the roar of the concerted explo-
sions washing like waves of water
around him he caught the second man
at the middle of the room-saw him
spin and fall-and with that maddened
coolness still touching every nerve and
fiber he tried for the third hand duck-
ing back beneath the gallery by the
fireplace this marksman shot away a
section of stairway banister knocking
up a loosely nailed board of the gallery
itself not a foot from where benton
stood and then cursing at each ham-
mer fall he hooked himself around
the kitchen doorways edge and got be-
yond range

  the front cried the girl watch
out

 but benton had seen the door go
down from the corner of his vision
and now free to divert his attention
he did all that he could do there were
again three cartridges left and a door-
way full of charging mcmurtrees into
that boiling jam of bodies he placed
the last of his shots wheeled and ran
to a bedroom the girl preceding him
closed the door quietly and stood
speechless in the deeper dark her
breath rising and falling the boom-
ing excited cries of the ranch crew
overflowed the main hall and beat
against the bedroom wall

  that window leads to the storeroom
roof said the girl

    benton closed the revolvers cylinder
 on another load remarking its gone
 this far so it might as well go a little
 farther

   the girl crossed the room pulling
 aside the curtains the window is
 open your luck wont last forever

   no murmured benton it never
 has

   then come on

   he was listening to the noise out
 there in the hall it sounded like an
 ax knocking away on the stairs furni-
 ture tipped and was dragged across the
 floor one mans voice seemed to be
 ordering all this in rapid nervous
 phrases

   its better for you to be left be-
 hind urged benton than to be
 struck by a bullet meant for me cross-
 ing the roof is dangerous business
 rae

   she was not beside him turning he
 saw her slip through the window a
 soft whisper came back

   whether you want it or not youve
 got me on your shoulders come on

   he followed dropping down two
 feet to the peak of the storeroom roof
 and flattening himself beside the girl
 who was lying on the shingles a soli-
 tary figure ran clumsily out of the
 barn passed beneath them and around
 to the front of the house elsewhere
 benton could make out no mcmurtree
 standing guard he let go of the roofs
 ridge and worked down to the eaves
 and a moment later dropped to the
 ground reaching up he seized the
 girl as she came to the eaves and
 steadied her she was whispering
 again

   follow me and ill run for the shed
where the horse is its only-

   hold fast warned benton

   a gun spoke flatly across the front


all western

yard a man began crying for the mc-
murtrees at the top of his voice the
smashing echoes in the house stopped
abruptly and benton made out the
pounding of feet across the living-room
floor hard on that the surrounding
blackness was pierced by the stinging
whine of rifle bullets and off at the
lower edge of the long meadow sound-
ed flat reports strung together like the
explosion of firecrackers

  try it snapped benton got to
get out of here now thats the black-
rock party come to pay back the raid 

  he lost the girl in that space of time
it took him to turn around but he
heard her running out into the shad-
ows and he followed more or less
blindly till the bulk of a small building
came against him she was there wait-
ing and catching his arm she led him
around to a doorway and through it
his horse moved up swung against
him

  out of this door and straight for-
ward said rae swiftly the trees are
only about two hundred feet off

  down-flat down grunted benton
and he fell pulling her with him

  there was trouble nearer at hand
the rifles were rolling out a louder
fury along the meadow and from that
immediate area beyond the shed-
where the girl had indicated their safe-
ty to lie-a great clatter and smashing
of brush announced a flanking attack
he heard men break clear and come on
afoot calling in undertones to each
other and presently he made out the
shifting line of about six men breast-
ing the dark benton crawled to the
door and laid his gun across it

  roll aside and keep your head low
he muttered to rae

 he thought the attacking hands
meant to collect by the shed they

raced on with every indication of do-
ing it which meant disaster for him
and for the girl benton lifted his gun
to throw them back

  but before his hammer fell a new
movement started the main body out
in front of the house seemed to be
halted by the resistance of the mcmur-
trees in the house a heavy call pene-
trated the shadows a call of warning
and direction and in response the half-
dozen men swinging up to the shed
veered sharply and went by it aiming
for the barn

  benton thought that the foreground
was clear and had started to rise when
a pair of men came dimly into view
crossing the ground at a slower pace
they disregarded the general fight in
fact they appeared to be avoiding it
for benton had barely time enough to
roll aside from the sheds doorway
when these two reached it and stopped

  damn-fool stunt-to hit the front
of the house said one

  wolferts full of fool stunts grunt-
ed the other

  you in any hurry to run against
that shootin

  do i look like it

we-ell this is a good place to be
yeah if wolfert dont catch us
hes plumb busy over yonder
dont lay no bets on it hes an in-
dian for findin out things

  say theres a pony in this shed
they stopped talking benton shifted
his gun and held his breath such faint
light as came through the door opening
was blocked out as one of the two men
tentatively stepped in and halted a
long straining moment of suspense en-
sued the pony blubbered a little and
shifted forward one of his feet grazed
benton and that seemed to frighten
him for he fiddled backward with an
the feudists



excited blast through his nostrils the
man remaining outside issued a low
warning

  i wouldnt be foolin around jeff

 somebody said the fellow inside
the shed put this critter here for a
quick run he took another step for-
ward changed his mind and wheeled
about benton saw him cross the dim
shield of the doorway and move be-
yond it

  maybe this aint no place for us
said the first voice too many stray
slugs

 all right well amble toward the
bam

 they went away at a trot and their
steps finally faded into the general up-
roar of the fight in the meadow this
had reached pitched proportions all
the guns were ripping the darkness
into shreds a man in the meadow was
yelling with a crazy ferocity but noth-
ing he said made sense yet it served
a purpose it never varied never
moved nearer or went farther away
and from it benton judged the attack-
ers were no closer to the house than
they had been the mcmurtree fire
held them

  appears to be a break here for us
whispered benton well try it

 she was up and beside him instant-
ly ride out on the dead run jim

  no that wont do you get on your
hands and knees and crawl across to
the tree line ill wait about half a min-
ute and then follow with the pony

 he saw her drop and move away and
then he lost her time lagged intoler-
ably and he caught himself methodical-
ly counting there was a distinct break
in the fight that worried him-a shift-
ing of forces some of wolferts men
were coming along the side of the
meadow apparently with the idea of

  hitting the house on an angle the mc-
murtrees caught that maneuver in-
stantly and began to fire through the
side windows the gun reports shifted
lashing out more distinctly and ben-
ton heard the whipping of the spent
lead along the ground and in the
brush meanwhile his mechanical
counting reached thirty and stopped
seizing the ponys cheek strap he led
it through the doorway paused for a
final check and struck straight across
the cleared area

  suddenly two great bombs of fire
shot into the sky from the meadow
the mcmurtrees had managed to build
their brush piles in that brief period
between the death of big lafe and
wolferts attack and now they had
been ignited the furious spires of
light at once caught part of wolferts
men in a deadly silhouette but the
light did more than that it reached
around the side of tfie house dispelled
even the farther shadows and revealed
benton halfway between the shed and
the brush

 someone cried out catch that
man

  a bullet flicked the dirt at his feet
and he saw two men race for him in
tandem order there was only one an-
swer he went up the wrong side of
the horse to the saddle and dug in his
spurs bent far down he crossed the
rest of the open stretch in great lunges
and drove heedlessly into the marginal
brush a volley of shots followed him
the horse abruptly winced staggered
and as benton threwr himself clear fell
headlong

  benton sprang aside from the bul-
let-swept space shouting rae-rae

then he brought up short feeling
the girls arm reach out and touch him
for answer he picked her up bodily


all western

and ran on into the depths of the tim-
ber a good fifty feet on down the lip
of a gully and into the mushy under-
footing of a forest creek safe here he
stopped and let the girl stand

  weve lost a horse he muttered

   theres a bunch of ponies back by
the edge of the yard said rae left
there by those men that came toward
the shed

  wait here said benton and climb-
ed from the gully the fires in the
meadow were burning brightly and he
saw the horses bracketed against this
light only a little to the left of him
closing in he got out his pocket knife
cut the cinches of all but two and led
these back he missed the girl again
and had to send out a short halloo
when he found her she said

  this is a warning for us jim we
must not get separated in these hills
what i want to do reflected ben-
ton is get back jo the high country
where we were riding the other day
you know the trails lead out

  jim challenged the girl a definite
ring in her words i want to know
are we staying in the hills or are we
leaving them

 well never go-not until were
driven out foot by foot

          chapter twelve
          burned bridges

he had no more to
 say and he wondered
 what had prompted
 the question but it
 was a tricky trail she
 followed and he lost
 her twice before they
 made the long curve
 about the mcmurtree meadow and
 paused on the edge of a southern can-

yon she stopped and turned the horse
about lifting an arm to what was go-
ing on over by the ranch

 jim-ill never go back there
never the ground is saturated with
blood i have nothing left-not one sin-
gle kinsman worth saving or remem-
bering its the end of the mcmurtree
ranch

  he had no reply there was none to
make those great glares were like fu-
neral pyres the house loomed up like
a fortress and the lesser buildings to
the rear were squat and dull crimson
men were rushing out of one covert
into another and long lances of orange-
purple creased the shadows about the
barn in that brief and final inspection
he saw one irregular wave of wolfert
men pour from the barn and stumble
forward converging on the back quar-
ter of the main house some of them
dropped the rest went on and van-
ished from view

  the yelling had increased pitching
across the meadow with a strangled
muted effect on the porch he saw the
climax of one bitter contest a wolfert
hand leaped from the darker side of
the house to the porch and raced across
it just as some mcmurtree hand opened
the door and came out there was no
parrying those two plunged together
in a snarling wrenching body-to-body
conflict and the mcmurtree man at last
caught his opponent under the arms
and forced him back into the house
somebody raced for the trees never
looking behind him a wolfert partisan
sped out of the barn with a lighted
torch in his fist got against the house
wall without injury and dropped the
torch against the wood after that he
scuttled the length of the wall and
passed to the rear rae mcmurtree
drew a quick hurt breath
the feudists



   lets get out of here i dont want
 to see any more

   lead for the high point yonder
 said benton gently and kept his mouth
 closed during the next long hour

   they dipped into the canyon and out
 of it they rose to the summits and
 passed beneath the rolling banks of
 fog the far-oft firing dimmed and died
 but once turning to scan the blank-
 ness of sky and earth he saw a widen-
 ing arc of crimson stain the distant
 obscurity the ranch was burning
 that grim old fortress of the hills was
 being consumed as blackrock had been

	consumed

   they were scraping the ceiling of
 the world and eastward the opaque
 quality of the night began to break
 another day stood on the threshold
 seeing that benton called a halt

they were in a small pine-surround-
ed glade that literally dripped with the
condensing mists unsaddling the two
i horses benton made a bed of the blan-
kets and his slicker

   roll up rae he said well get
 what breathing spell we can

   she dropped without protest ex-
 hausted for himself he crimped a
i cigarette and cupped a match in the
crown of his hat crouched indian-
fashion beside the girl he watched the
broad bands of light wedge the horizon
i -glad to have this long night go even
i though he found no promise in the
 hours coming the worst of the fight
 was still ahead-of that he was abso-
i lutely sure such exits as there were
i from the hills would soon be guarded
 wolfert would never let them go with-
 out contest tipping his head he saw
t that rae was not sleeping very quiet

	in the blankets she watched him
r through the twilight and fog mists

 jim she asked abruptly what

crime could possibly be against you
why should you of all men be run-
ning from a posse i dont understand
youre not that sort of a man you
never could be

  he sat silent awhile puzzling over
his answer herealized now that he
had not told her because he had dared
to wonder if it would make a differ-
ence to her the girl turned away mis-
taking his silence and said rather
quickly

  i dont want to pry into your af-
fairs never mind

 a day might come he mused
when my affairs might be your af-
fairs is that possible rae

  maybe she answered just above
a murmur maybe jim

  as to this posse business-

i told you i didnt want to pry
tomorrow he said simply may
never come and i wouldnt want you
to remember me as a fellow better than
i was-or worse

  dont you suppose i have eyes to
see jim i have watched hard men
mean men youre not that sort you
carry yourself straight you speak as
if there wasnt anybody in the land
you were afraid of you looked directly
at my father

  thanks rae

  as for the posse- her voice quiet-
ed turned wistful as for the posse-
i guess we all make honest mistakes
im not holding it against you i wish
your back trail was clear but if it
isnt t dont care i dont care jim
ill say this much put in benton
swiftly it was nothing much-and
may turn out to be less well let it
ride like that till the shootins over
after a pause she asked what did
you want to do

  well-if i were alone id never


all western

move an inch rae

  then said the girl that is what
well do

  you dont get it he explained i
mean id make my stand on the bench
and wait out whats coming

  i understood it the first time you
said it

  i came back to settle a score im
not entirely sure it is settled when
wolfert dies ill know it is settled but
thats only half the story i was born
in these hills rae this is my old
home i came back to see what it
looked like i dont want to go away
now this country was meant for me
that ranch down on the bench-i want
it

  i dont see how youll ever get it
or hold it the girl reflected

  remains to be seen said benton
casually grim

  rae mcmurtrees two hands came to-
gether tightly jim wolfert will fight
id hate to see you-

 what

 she shook her head and looked
away lips pressed white benton rose
and kicked the cramp from his legs
the mists were sinking into the round-
about canyons and this high peak
stood momentarily isolated from the
world the sky was still full of stars
but the grayness of early morning
filled it lightened it and slowly shifted
to a paling blue eastward a rose light
began to lift false rain dropped from
tree and bush the two horses were a
hundred feet off cropping the lush
grass the smell of smoke drifted on
the slight wind-the smoke of the mc-
murtree ranch buildings the girl
called benton back

  we might as well have it out she
said

  benton turned finding a brighter

glow in the girls eyes the color of
inner emotion shaded her white even
features

 tell me what-what i know you
want to tell me she demanded

  this is no time for it he coun-
tered

  when will be a better time she
challenged him if it wont survive
bad luck it wont survive good are
you afraid of that jim

  all right he answered at once
rough and direct i want you for my
wife rae

  she stood up from the blankets
you can have me

  were not out of trouble yet were
in deep

  all the more reason why we should
settle this i want you to know what-
ever happens

  youve lived among outlaws all
your life said benton coming toward
her youve had no security and no
peace now youve got me on your
hands knowing im hunted rae it
may be a bad bargain

  i know said the girl she reached
out and took one of his hands but i
cant run away from myself if this is
the way it is to be for me then theres
nothing more to be said

  benton gripped her fingers and then
stepped suddenly back

  theres a lot more to be said but
well not say it now im going to that
pinnacle to have a look better lie down
and rest while weve got the chance
twenty yards away he heard her
say something indistinct when he
looked around she was smiling one
small hand rose swiftly to her mouth
and went out to him

  gamblers sometimes win jim she
called but if they lose theyve had
the gamble anyhow run along
the feudists



        chapter thirteen
        renegade justice

arther away the
curve of the hillside
cut her from sight
leaving him with a
strange reluctance and
strange misgivings so
pronounced was the
feeling that he paused
and stood with his attention weighing
the minor sounds arising out of the
mornings primeval calm reassured
he went on found a more or less clear
grade and mounted the rough pin-
nacle

  at its tip the panoramic view of the
hills unrolled to all sides by now the
mists had condensed in the lower can-
yons and coursed along them like
foaming tides of water each jagged
and rounded surface of the country lay
exposed running northward to a still
greater tangle of ravine and ridge and
sloping out southward to the prairie
that way benton made a long survey
seeking the outline of blackrock and
finding only a dim char mark on the
earth of the mcmurtree ranch he
could locate no fragment but he did
see a column of smoke bellying up
from behind a flat-topped butte the
passions of men these last few hours
had consumed much he realized how
hopeless it was now to expect a lessen-
ing of the chase or a softening of the
unleashed antagonisms there was
more to be consumed fire never died
till it had eaten away the substance of
its own heart

  it was bentons habit to analyze his
fortunes pessimistically during idle
spells now he considered the account
to date and found it dismal enough
from first entry into the country he

had been pretty much thrown about
at no time had there been a break or a
breathing spell in which he might
choose his own plan events had rush-
ed him along until now he faced a
three-way attack

  the mcmurtrees were against him
wolfert and wolferts band would
hunt for him and lastly there was
that new force in the battle to account
for-the prairie men they would as-
semble on the ruins of blackrock and
march forward

  each bunch set against the other
benton told himself and all of em
set against me i dont know which
way to look first wolfert may still be
engaged with the mcmurtrees or one
or the other party may have run off
the one mighty certain fact is that the
prairie bunch will be coming this way
theyll tangle with the mcmurtrees
without comment probably theyll do
the same with the wolfert outfit if they
catch up wolfert himself might talk
his way into the prairie delegation but
he could never convince the prairie
boys that his bunch of rustlers were
on the right side so it stands-all
messed up only other clear item is
that wolfert will try to write me off
before i get a chance to betray him to
anybody else

  he whipped his head to the west-
ward and held it rigid eyes focusing
on a clearing on the side of a ridge
about two miles distant a small file of
men charged across that space and dis-
appeared into the smother of timber
again bentons glance ran along the
edges of that particular tree mass lo-
cating the adjoining clearings and for
a long time he waited expecting the
party to come again into view when
it did however it was only briefly and
vaguely in the bottom of the canyon


all western

the course taken seemed to indicate
an intention of reaching the summit
country that he was in

  not very many there he thought
part of wolferts band split off maybe
detachment of the prairie people no
theyd hang together for the big smash
or else it is whats left of the mcmur-
tree boys likely the sad survivors of
a proud outfit

  it was time to move his trail was
still fresh in the yielding turf of the
hills and they might cut it and follow
ten minutes more of sweeping scru-
tiny produced no results and a last
look to the prairie netted nothing im-
pelled then by the sense of time
wasted he left the pinnacle and quar-
tered to its foot

  if i drift backward he said to him-
self i gain nothing and lose ground
if i sidestep i keep in touch- that
was as far as his thinking went

 through the trees and along the
bending trail rae mcmurtrees cry
half scream and half call of warning
came shrill and shocking and ended
on a high note the effect of it was
literally to throw benton back on his
heels and he hung in that odd balance
till the cry seeming to be released by
terrific force struck the shaky silence
again

 benton plunged forward with his
head lowered boots battering the soft
earth his hand lowered once and rose
automatically and thus he rounded
the bend and raced over the little glade
with gun lifted and searching he had
drawn the hammer half back before
he saw that he could not shoot

  the girl struck to her knees rose
with both hands reached forward
thedore-the slash-cheeked sullen-
visaged thedore-stepped away from
her and cursed morosely then raes

arms went around him with a frenzied
strength and for a moment checked
his draw she was aware of bentons
return thedore spilling over with
rage had not yet discovered the fact
all his thoughts were on the girl he
lifted her with a heave of his shoul-
ders got one arm free and struck her
across the face with a force that
knocked her down again

  it was then that his shifting glance
found benton instantly thedores
body stiffened a wild and vicious and
hunted expression flashed across the
sulky cheeks and thereafter settled to
a fixed mask of incredible hatred

  rae cried benton fury throbbing
in the words step aside from him
thedore took a step toward the ris-
ing girl clearly meaning to use her for
a shield but he was checked by ben-
tons veering gun muzzle and the dead
flat-toned command stick to your
tracks

  the girl turned to benton and start-
ed to speak but she saw his gaze
riveted to thedore and apparently
understood the danger of diverting it
white and trembling she moved back
out of range

  thedore droned benton youve
prowled too long

  youve got the drop on me mut-
tered thedore between his teeth i
cant draw

  you want to draw

give me an even chance at it
why should i snapped benton
youve got no break cornin to you
thedores eyes squinted across the
interval red and crafty his tone
turned wheedling persuasive

 look here when you was down
and out yesterday morning and wol-
fert wanted to finish the job right
there i bucked at it its me you can
the feudists



thank for bein alive

  youre a yellow hound thedore
stated benton all that stopped you
from putting the bullet in me was a
streak of butter up your back a foot
wide you wanted to do it bad
enough is that what youre on my
trail for

  me hell im not on your trail im
on my way im leavin this country
im through

 why seemed to me you and wol-
fert had it all agreed what are you
worry in about now

  wolfert-that dog he yelled

 so youre not good friends now
asked benton ironically

ill kill him breathed thedore
for a fact in other words he cut
your throat before you had a chance to
cut his i never knew a thief worth
trusting youre no exception

  call this off pleaded thedore
call it off and ill be on my way you
got grief enough without scrappin me
im  through i tell you

  benton let the talk drop for a min-
ute the forest stillness flowed through
the clearing westward a great glow
of warm bright light rose heralding
the sun a woodpecker attacked the
surface of a dead tree above them and
a long staccato rapping broke the
peace the scent of pine and steaming
earth was heavy in the air the girl
had her back to a sapling her small
shoulders sagging but her eyes were
pinned to benton with an odd care as
for thedore the strain of waiting cut
deeper lines across his lawless visage
he stirred uneasily

  reach across with your left hand
pick your gun with two fingers and
drop it to the ground ordered ben-
ton

  youre not goin to pull a spanish

on me bawled thedore

  do as i say pressed benton
thedore obeyed with a lagging re-
luctance he plucked the gun from its
holster add dropped it at his feet ben-
ton smiled grimly

  youre full of tricks my friend but
thats an old one now kick that piece
over my way

  thedores lips curved to a cruel
vulpine crescent he caught the gun
on his boot toe and sent it spinning
benton reached down got it and flung
it into the far bushes he straightened
suddenly catching a forward gesture
on thedores part and for another
dully dragging interval he studied the
mcmurtree foreman keenly

  now get on your pony and fog out
of here he said at last i ought to use
my quirt on your back but theres
some pleasures i guess ill have to pass
up

 thedore sighed enormously the
strain went from his cheeks and he
reached into his vest pocket with a
careful deliberation bringing out his
tobacco he rolled a cigarette con-
tempt gradually curling into his lip
corners catching this shift of temper
benton realized he had misjudged his
man thedore mistook mildness for
weakness 

  youll never get in the clear
sneered thedore im tellin you this
minute the hills are bein locked up
damn you benton i wish i was
around to see your finish

  he pulled a match from his pocket
and lit it against his thumb nail ben-
ton weary of the delay holstered his
gun

  get on your pony and go if i ever
see you floating around here again i
wont bother about warning you

  he moved ahead a foot and turned


all western

toward the girl

  this seems the best way even-

  that was his mistake and he realized
it even as he tried to whip himself
backward and get his gun in operation
again but he never quite made it
thedore had been waiting for that
off-guard moment his long body set
for the chance hurtled the distance
struck benton viciously and knocked
him back thedores big arms locked
about bentons waist he tripped ben-
ton and fell with him and the sheer
weight of his body knocked the wind
completely out of bentons chest

  half paralyzed benton tried to roll
clear and got a sledgelike smash on
the temple thedore cursing drew up
a knee trying to grind it into bentons
stomach as he meanwhile reached for
the protruding gun butt on bentons
hip at that bentons breath came
back to him at a rush his arms were
free lifting them he caught thedore
about the neck and at the same time
kicked the mans body upward with
his feet thedore emitted a strangled
yell and capsized on one shoulder
shaken clear of benton benton rolled
and got to his feet and stood there
breathing hard

  all right thedore he grunted
ill get my pleasure after all come
on up

  thedore was at him with a swift-
ness and a ferocity born of a gamble
gone bad he tried to grip benton
again but benton sidestepping caught
the man with a driving right-hand
blow that skewed thedores frame
half around stunned and shaken he
made a fair target and benton went for
him with relentless fury ripping the
half-mad face with driving fists the-
dore tried to bring his own arms into
play he groped uncertainly and tried

for his bear hug right then he was
wide open and benton put the full
weight of his body into one mauling
smash under the chin thedore went
down breath gasping out of his slack
and bloody mouth and rolled in agony
from shoulder to shoulder rae mc-
murtree ran forward her hands touch-
ing bentons bruised cheeks

   jim-if id had a gun i would have
 killed him

  hes through rasped benton
reaching deeply for air

   then a slow voice behind them said
 be careful and dbht try to draw

  spinning in his tracks benton saw
 one of the younger mcmurtree boys
 rise from the brush with a revolver in
 his fist seven others of the mcmurtree
 clan advanced from the surrounding
 thicket and closed in

chapter fourteen
home again

jcen aback benton
stood fast but the
girl turned and put
herself defensively in
front of him

 you fools have made
 mistakes enough she
 said angrily i wont
 stand for any more do you hear me
 if you werent blind youd see the dif-
 ference between jim benton and that
 -that killer over there on the
 ground she stamped her foot and the
 flushed color burned brighter on her
 cheeks thedore led you around as if
 you were a bunch of infants he made
 you jump through circles for him you
 believed in him so much that you let
 my father die in his own house well
 what have you got out of it nothing
 the house is gone and most of you are
the feudists



 gone now thedores running away
 do you believe in him now

  easy easy cautioned one of the
mcmurtrees give us a little credit
what for demanded the girl
scornfully

  yeah muttered the man i know
it dont sound so well

  what do you want now
thedore said the mcmurtree hand
bluntly we discovered the dope about
him just a little while ago we had a
showdown he got away from us

  the fellow holding the gun put it
slowly back into its holster explain-
ing to benton

  didnt know how youd act when
you saw us come so we thought it best
to get the drop on you no hard
feel ins

  lin said the girl where are the
rest of the boys

  lin was the spokesman a tall and
gangling hand with the pointed and
darkish mcmurtree features promi-
nent

  this is about the size of it rae
he answered slowly were all shot
to pieces

  you can thank thedore for that
cried the girl bitterly

  thedore replied lin noncommit-
tally will get his pay without
thanks he walked over to the fallen
ex-foreman and looked down with an
expression suddenly bleak beyond
measure he prodded thedore with
his boot and stepped back waiting
but thedore was still senseless and
after a moment lin silently motioned
another hand to keep watch swinging
on benton he began to speak with a
heavy regret

  youve been on the right side all
along weve been on the wrong were
glad you got shut of us without hurt

and were sorry the fightin happened
youre a damned good hand mister i
wish- but lin mcmurtree stopped
the wish short and looked about with
a sort of wistful hopelessness no use
cryin the damage is done and were
through we sure have sung our little
song nothing to do now but pay the
fiddler

 wheres wolfert and his bunch
asked benton

  we beat those boys off grunted
lin with a show of satisfaction just
before daylight they got a bellyful of
it and backed away

  then said benton why dont you
stick it out

  but lin kept shaking his head it
wont do theres another crowd
cornin up the blackrock-morgantown
road we sighted it just before we left
the ranch half the prairie in that
troop you know what those fellows
aim to do dont you sure wipe out
the mcmurtrees for once and for good
theyd do it too and never let us
shout for mercy i said we had to pay
the fiddler didnt i were through
only thing now is to get out of the
country and disappear complete there
aint any more mcmurtree outfit he
looked at the girl gently adding we
buried your dad in the grave lot rae
it was thedore that shot him

 the girl nodded and turned away
from them walking back toward the
edge of the clearing

  well this is wasting time lin
said bring up thedores horse and
tie him to the saddle hes goin with
us

  benton looked at this lank mcmur-
tree and saw thedores fate in the
mans darkling glance thedore was
through then as if answering the un-
spoken question lin said


all western

  hell get his chance-but he wont
survive it

  silence fell full of discouragement
and brooding melancholy they had
brought up thedores horse and were
tying his feet under the animals belly
and his hands to the horn one of the
group mounted and steadied him the-
dore was waking with a painful reflex
of his muscles the scarred face turned
from side to side only half recognizing
the situation he said thickly

  get benton-thats the main thing
then his mind cleared and he looked
down at his roped wrists you aint
got me yet he bawled

 nobody answered him his eyes
went to lin mcmurtree full of fear
but mcmurtree stared back expression-
lessly

  you think wolferts men held to-
gether asked benton

 maybe maybe not judged lin
they took a lot of punishment aint
so many left as youd think id hate
to go through a fight like that again
it was hell-just plain hell if those
crooks stick by wolfert now theyre
bigger gluttons for punishment than
i take em to be he bowed his head
quite thoughtful you want my
straight opinion of it well this coun-
try has had a housecleanin in a
damned odd fashion two crooked
sides killed each other off aint that
somethin to laugh over

  boys said thedore pleading his
case if youll let me go and give me
a gun ill swear ill never stop ridin
till i knock wolfert out of the saddle
so help me

  he was entirely ignored lin looked
at the girl called to her

rae weve got some extra horses
come along were wastin time here
she wheeled im not going with

you lin

  what grumbled lin lord you
dont think wed leave you-

  im not going she said firmly
well howre you going to take care
of yourself when- lin began but
another thought came to him and he
pulled his head about and stared at
benton sharply so thats it huh
yes said the girl thats it

  what do you aim to do lin asked
benton bluntly

  stick this is my country

  dont be too proud of your chances
mister this scrape aint over wol-
ferts around and them prairie lads
wont consider you very kindly
another of the outfit called out
harrys cornin

  a slim small youth spurred up the
slope and through the brush he was
hatless and excited

  that blackrock bunch reached the
ranch he said rapidly circled it once
and lit out thisaway

  weve got to tail out of here de-
cided lin rae its up to you

  no

  the mcmurtrees mounted lin look-
ed down at benton his face sharpened
by that clinging and insistent regret

i wish you luck i wish wed known
you a long time ago one thing im
damned sure about-youll do better
for rae than any of her own kin did
so long said benton

 they moved compactly across the
clearing these ten mcmurtrees with
the bound thedore in the center of
the group another moment and they
were around the trails bend benton
heard thedore lift his voice in a
choked wild-toned cursing and this i
continued until the distance absorbed
voice and hoofbeat alike he looked at
rae
the feudists



   were making a stand he told her
 but i dont want to make it here
 youre thinking about the ranch
 down on the bench she said

   thats it

   they went to the horses and stepped
  up the girl was wratching him curi-
 ously you realize jim that the sher-
 iff will be with those blackrock men
 i know he said smiling grimly
 but we cant dodge it forever rae
 its only-

  she put out her arm and stopped
 him jim id rather run than lose
 you

   he shook his head that aint the
 right answer lets go

  she raised her shoulders with a
 queer gesture of futility and thereafter
 said no more benton left the glade by
 its sloping edge tackled the steeper
 side and reached a canyons bed a
 deer trail went dimly along it through
 sedge and little pools made by the con-
 densing mists they came to a cross
 gulch took it and by degrees worked
 out of the high terrain into lower and
 more open country far behind rose a
 single shot tjrie sunlight began to
 reach between the thinning tree tops
 and they passed across alternate strips
 of shadow and golden puddles of light
 a vista of the far-reaching prairie
 opened before them seeing that sweep
  of tawny earth the girl came out of
 i her abstraction

f and so i go back to the flats where
 i was born you know jim i never
 got used to the hills they are too se-

	cretive-too dark too close they kept
 cutting off my view the hills have
i been a hiding-place for my family all
this time i dont want to hide any
j more

 from the porch of my house said
benton the whole world rolls away

  jim said the girl simply youre
not through with wolfert yet

  no answered benton no not
yet

  the trees made a scattering show
and petered out beside a low-lying
meadow the girl spurred abreast of
benton and they crossed the meadow
at a canter and entered a thicket of
willows beyond that they halted the
benton clearing lay ahead buildings
bathed by the mid-morning sun

  stay here till i go see if weve got
visitors benton said

  then he spurred across the open and
turned the far side of the main house
there were no ponies standing about
dismounting he went inside the house
and explored it thoroughly

  satisfied he went out and signaled
to the girl who rode up and dis-
mounted

  my dad mused benton had an
idea of being a permanent citizen he
built this place to last even now idle
for so many years its still sound a
little repairing would make it snug
and comfortable like it

  another time she answered very
quietly ill tell you about that

  she wheeled abruptly and entered
the house benton grinned slowly and
strolled into the yard

  there was a strange feeling in him
he had been sure of nothing he had
been knocked about betrayed and shot
at until all his thoughts were cautious
and trimmed to each short day per-
manence was something he never had
known safety had always depended
on his own vigilance his own keen
perceptions and so with his feet
planted on soil that belonged to him
that strange unusual feeling grew
stronger and stronger it was as if he
were putting his roots down like some

thirsty plant seeking water this was
the end of his journey-

                                                      i

chapter fifteen
silenced guns

here was a sound a
small quick sound
from the house look-
ing about he saw rae
standing at a second-
story window her
hand pointed not to
him but to the north
in the direction of the willows instant-
ly on the alert he turned and his rac-
ing glance caught a slow weaving of
the brush over there

  for the moment he stood still real-
izing the target he made the line of
willows was five hundred feet away
admirable shelter he immediately
guessed that he was not engaged with
any part of the blackrock posse those
men would not be hiding in the brush
it was with wolferts partisans he had
to deal eyeing the willow edges he
discovered no other point of activity
and meanwhile the movement at the
first point ceased one man then and
this man crouched for a sure aim that
meant a rifle-no revolver could effec-
tively reach a target at such distance
very slowly wheeling benton idled
toward the house with an exaggerated
show of indifference

  between himself and the house stood
a pump and water trough this was
the shelter he wanted against that
threatening gun and as inconspicuous-
ly as he could make it he slightly
shifted his march to come behind the
heavy planks of the trough meanwhile
his leisurely striding covered the dis-
tance

not until he was within a few paces

of the trough did his gait quicken
then he made one great forward
lunge

  his leap broke the intolerable strain
of waiting a crackling echo filled the
clearing and a rifle bullet plucked the
air hungrily beside him he dived for
the trough and rolled behind it and
then the marksman opened up with an
angry abandon lead began to thud
into the planks jets of dust leaped like
snake heads at the exact meeting point
of trough corner and ground tallying
the shots with cold calculation benton
was prepared when silence fell at last
but he held his place waiting for one
more explosion he knew that trick
as the seconds ticked on however he
grew impatient of his sightless posi-
tion and decided on another old trick
he took his hat and pushed it slowly
beyond the end of the planks instantly
afterward it was whipped from his
hand and went rolling away

  this was the break he waited for a
longer interval would follow before
the marksman could get his fresh load
into the rifle pulling himself erect
benton left the trough on the run aim-
ing for the house an enormous bellow
drove out of the brush swinging his
glance to the willows he saw hale
wolfert smash through them and ap-
pear in the open wolfert lifted his
rifle and threw it away he reached
for his revolver came directly on for
a matter of a hundred feet and then
wheeled a little later he vanished be-
hind the house

 damn fool said benton to him
self he threw off his advantage when
he dropped the rifle whats the mat
ter with the man but as he asked
the question he thought he knew the
answer wolfert was quite sure of his
own power he now elected to close in
the feudists



  and end the debate with the revolver

   benton ran along the porch of the
 house and reached the open yard be-
 yond wolfert appeared at about the
 same time not farther than two hun-
 dred yards off pie saw benton at the
 same moment that benton saw him
 instantly he turned from his direct
 charge passed on to an adjacent wa-
 gon shed and got out of sight benton
 came to a halt and waited
 j he had a very brief wait wolfert
 j appeared on the left of the wagon
 shed he saw benton stationed there
 by the smokehouse and broke forward
 into a run the next moment however
 he came to a halt

   benton called wolfert lets do
  no more dodgin im cornin straight
  at you

   come on said benton

    wolfert held his peace briefly look-
  ing all about then he returned his
  gaze to benton

   if youve got any guts he an-
nounced youll stand your ground
r and settle this now
j im waiting

   at that wolfert raised his gun and
i started to run with his head half low-
 ered the two hundred yards quickly

	became a hundred and fifty benton
 stood quite still small and stray im-
pressions registering in a mind other-
wise coldly concentrated somewhere
 behind wolfert-somewhere over by
i the willows-was the sound of horses
solidly pacing down out of the hills

   benton lifted his gun seeing more
 clearly than anything else the big plaid
 checkers on wolferts shirt one of
 those checkers was broader and bright-
 er than the others at a hundred yards
 j wolfert lifted his head and began to
 fire not slowing his pace
 j unconscious of it benton winced as

the first slug went beside him but he
was still waiting for the interval to
narrow thinking of nothing now but
one shot-only one shot-accurately
placed he felt wolferts second bullet
hit at his feet then he shifted slightly
in his tracks pulled his weapon to the
level of his eyes and fired

  it was a direct hit and it jarred wol-
fert out of his forward advance with
the effect of a solid blow the man
straightened and stiffened and across
the brutally stamped visage passed
the strange and astonished and fearful
expression that was a sure forecast of
his fate benton made no attempt to
try another shot he knew he had
seen that expression before on the
faces of men just before they died in
violence

  the sound of horses welled across
the meadow and rather faintly he got
the back-and-forth calling of many
men but it was of no importance at
this moment wolfert shook his shoul-
ders his gun slipped from relaxing
fingers he issued a strangled cough
fear staring out of his eyes and then
struggling against it he fell loosely to
the ground benton pivoted away
wishing to see no more lifting his
eyes he found the meadow full of rid-
ers a group of four circled the house
and charged toward him all of them
covered him with their guns

  if its wolfert you want sheriff
he said calmly youre too late

  there was no doubt about the sher-
iff his vest held a shining star

  youre reno asked the lawman

  i used to travel under that name
im hi bentons son back home

  so said the sheriff interestedly
he bent forward in the saddle more
closely inspecting benton you were
little jim benton


all western

  all the blackrock riders were circled
around benton dusty and jaded men
in scowling humor rae mcmurtree
ran from the house and came across
she passed between the horses and
stood beside benton silently defiant
it was the habit of years this instant
antagonism to the riders of the flats
and she could not break it now

  youve run me a merry chase jim
said the sheriff you know i want
you dont you

  youve got a warrant sworn by
dave latouche from over shell river
way

  yeah said the sheriff chargin
you with cattle stealin sorry get
your horse

  the warrant is no good explained
benton gently he reached into his
pocket the motion brought the trained
guns quickly down on him but he
smiled and drew out a folded bit of
paper he walked over and handed
it up to the sheriff the deal was
framed this is from latouche

  the sheriff unfolded and read the
note he looked up coldly angry

  i dont get this you and latouche
frame a deal latouche swears out a
warrant and i spend my time chasin
you all over the flats and here la-
touche says it dont mean anything i
want some clear talk on this

  heres your answer said benton
indicating the ranch i wanted to
come back my idea was to find the
fellow that killed my dad well how
was i going to get into this country
if i rode into blackrock as an ordinary
hand id be suspected of something
right away those fellows are always
looking for the joker only way i could
rig it was to come in all lathered you
on my trail it made me out a crooked
customer and it explained me thats

what blackrock needed-an explana-
tion

  and supposin said the sheriff
id got you

  had to take the chance benton
drawled it worked didnt it i got
in i found the man that killed my
dad im back on the ranch

  who killed hi inquired the sher-
iff bending still farther forward

  one of two men both of them dead
-both bad enough to have done the
trick and probably working together
on that deal vilas or wolfert

  the sheriff sat back deeply thought-
ful his head nodded slightly as if ben-
tons talk satisfied some long-suspend-
ed judgment he had a reputation for
taciturnity and quick action and now
he justified the reputation by reaching
into his pocket and throwing a long
folded sheet to the ground it was the
warrant

  burn it up and consider the story
finished the sheriff said slowly even-
ly the hills are pretty clear of trou-
ble are you fixing to stay here

  im back for good benton stated
this is the end of the road for me
as for the girl-

  this mcmurtree stays too sheriff
well run the hills together

  the sheriff turned to his nearest
man put wolfert in a saddle well
take that chore off bentons hands
looking back to the girl he raised
his hat and bowed with a rather for-
mal courtesy im glad to see it come
out this way always admired you
rae always had a sneaking respect for
your dad hes restin-as we all will
some day knowin him id say he was
satisfied with the end for you life is
only beginning benton i consider you
lucky good luck turn around boys
were through	the end

by stephen payne

he man hiding in the aspens atop
the hill had not eaten a square
meal for a week twenty-four hours
had passed since he had eaten at all
gaunt and bewhiskered his eyes sunk
deep in their sockets his skin stretched
taut over high cheek bones his drab
clothing torn and ragged he looked
more like a scarecrow that a human
being

 his raw bruised swollen feet
throbbed and ached every muscle was
a numbing torture the griping hunger
pains were so acute that at times he
twitched convulsively yet the same
grim purpose which had driven him
onward these past seven days still

held him in its grip so eager was he
to continue onward that he resented
fiercely the delay caused by the meet-
ing of two horsemen in the valley be-
low him

 he knew these men for this was
only a few miles from the little ranch
on buffalo creek where he once had
lived to reach it he must cross this
valley and he dared not be seen and
recognized so as sunset spread its
flamboyant banners across all the
jagged mountain sky line he crouched
among the aspens waiting for these
two men to end their argument and
ride on

  voices lifted in anger reached up to
joe kildares ears armstrong the
younger of the two horsemen was ac-
cusing drake of stealing his water
well let them argue it was no skin
off his nose he had enough troubles
of his own-but damn them they
were holding him up costing him

precious time

 he remembered george armstrong
as a friendly decent sort a steady
young fellow who had built himself a
nice little outfit on squaw creek just
below farley drakes holdings joe
kildare recalled the rumors that he
had heard more than five years back
just before he had been convicted of
murder and sentenced to twenty years
in prison that armstrong was soon to
marry molly oliver

  kildares eyes softened as he thought
of molly-a mighty fine girl shed been
he mused- now what was drake
shouting

  betcher life m headgates open
armstrong-and open she stays

 an ornery old cuss drake-domi-
neering and quarrelsome kildare re-
membered nor was he above maver-
icking all the calves and colts he could
get an iron on or so it was suspected
anyway though hed never been
caught redhanded at it the fight brew-
ing between him and armstrong re-
minded joe kildare forcibly of his own
troubles on the buffalo

  larsen parks a sullen and ill-tem-
pered neighbor had tried to run a
whizzer on kildare and failing had
started cutting his fence kildare
thereupon served notice that anyone
he caught fooling with his fence would
stop lead two days later at dawn he
had been called upon to make good on
his wild talk so he had fired a rifle
shot high above the head of the man
wielding the wire cutters-and to kil-
dares amazement the fellow had
dropped in his tracks

  swiftly investigating kildare had
found the man a total stranger dead
a rifle bullet had torn clear through
him then most abruptly larsen
parks had appeared with the sheriff-

and joe kildare went over the road on
a murder charge he believed he knew
what had happened parks had a rider
named flame halliday who had a
killers record he must have been hid-
den near by and when kildare fired
halliday shot simultaneously murder-
ing parkss fence-cutting pawn still
joe kildare couldnt prove it-they
didnt give him a chance

  now he inched forward alert again
interested in spite of his own driving
obsession armstrong face flushed
was telling drake what he thought of
him

  ill shut that headgate and let the
water im entitled to run down to my
ditch and nobodys stoppin me ev-
eryone knows youre a damn thief
drake-

  thats fightin talk you sob
yelled drake fill your hand as the
challenge rang out his  was clear-
ing leather

  the crash of gunfire echoed across
the little valley two streaks of flame
licked out toward armstrong as he sat
astride his wheeling horse before he
got his own weapon unlimbered then
he fired once

 drake swaying drunkenly in the
saddle was carried a hundred feet by
his snorting mount before he slipped
from its back a little spiral of dust
rose slowly from the figure huddled on
the dry grass

  armstrong rode over swung off and
looked at the man on the ground he
pushed back his hat mopped his face
with his bandanna then mounted and
loped away up the valley drakes
frightened horse had vanished

 the brief mountain twilight was
fading when the gaunt scarecrow with
the sunken eyes and whisker-stubbled
cheeks stole out of the aspens to limp
the gun



down and stop by the still body of
farley drake

  seems like fate gave me this chance
to heel myself he thought unbuckling
the dead mans gun belt and putting it
about his own lean hips he pried the
colt out of drakes stiffening fingers
the effort made him weak and dizzy
how feeble and shaky he was-in this
condition he could hardly hope to
tackle parks and his hired killer
something to eat a good nights sleep
-these he needed before he would
dare to try it

  but could he afford to take the time
pursuit might be close at this very mo-
ment though he had seen no signs of
it for three days now another dizzy
spell decided it for him-he would
have to take the chance

  three hours later he was hiding in
the hayloft in the new log barn of
george armstrongs hat bar spread
the place closest to the scene of the
afternoons tragedy here he could find
food stealing into the kitchen after all
had gone to bed here his exhausted
body could get the rest it so sorely
needed tomorrow-he licked his dry
lips-ah tomorrow he would square
accounts with larsen parks and flame
halliday

  he had arrived in time to see arm-
strongs hired hand go riding off to-
ward the distant town of buffalo
through a lighted window of the little
ranch house he could see armstrong
holding his young wife in his arms-
yes it was molly oliver

  she was still as pretty as ever but
her face was white her dark eyes wide
with anxiety and fear she citing to
armstrong as though she never meant
to let him go and her husband
smoothed her hair kissed her patted
her shoulder seemed to be speaking

reassuring words

 all this the ragged fugitive had
seen peering into the lighted room be-
fore he climbed into the hayloft the
pain of his overtaxed muscles the tor-
ture of his bruised and aching feet
now seemed as nothing beside the
wracking hunger pains in his belly as
he smelled the savory odors of coffee
hot biscuits and beef that wafted to
him across the yard tempted almost
beyond endurance he still stuck to his
place in the concealing hay he dared
not reveal himself to ask for food-
george and molly knew him knew his
record he could take no chances until
he had found the men he had come
over a hundred and fifty miles on foot
to kul

  joe kildare peered out of the barn
as a group of horsemen rode into the
ranch yard in the yellow lamplight
that streamed out of the open kitchen
door and through the windows of the
house he recognized armstrongs
hired hand sheriff adams and four
ranchers all of whom he had known
more or less intimately in the old days
armstrong and molly came out to meet
them	

  the grizzled sheriff spoke tersely
george it was to your credit you sent
for me now lets have your story

  me and drake have been at odds
armstrong answered readily we met
in shadow valley late this afternoon
and quarreled about water one word
led to another and finally he went for
his gun-tried to kill me he fired
twice before i finally shot in self-de-
fense my first shot dropped him
thats all

  the sheriff and the four ranchers
all stony-faced looked at each other

  george the old peace officer bit
out we brought the coroner out with


all western

us to take the body back to buffalo
we found drake layin there where he
fell man there wasnt a gun on drake
-not even a cartridge belt

  joe kildare saw mollys hand fly to
her mouth saw her husband turn
chalky-white then flame-red and
heard him gasp

no gun why drake was heeled
id like to believe that george
said adams itd be nice for you if
you could prove it but they wasnt
any witness-was there george

  it came to joe kildare that the law-
mans voice was trembly he knew
armstrong well and liked him-want-
ed to clear him if he could

 the ranchers were exchanging
glances again they probably had felt
sympathy with armstrong too in his
quarrel with drake but they had seen
drake dead from a gunshot wound
though he himself was weaponless

  up in the loft joe kildare bit his
bloodless lips and his eyes burned
with a strange glow

 witness armstrong repeated
why-why no we was alone-
sheriff i tell you he had a gun-he
started the fight i didnt touch him
afterward either-damn it he still had
that gun in his hand when he was
layin there dead its the truth- dont
look at me that way like i was a-
he choked off stepped close to the
sheriffs stirrup and stared bleakly up
into the lawmans face with a half-
stifled sob molly turned hid her eyes
with her arm groped for the door
frame and went back into the house

  adams reached into one of his sad-
dle pockets and a metallic jangle rang
in joe kildares ears like a knell of
doom the sheriffs voice seemed to
leap up at him

  wont have to use these bracelets

george if youll come along peaceful
i dont like to do this boy-but im
afraid itll go hard with you dont see
how any jury can reach a verdict of
lessn second-degree murder

  god thats tough one of the other
men said itll mean twenty year in
canyon city pen george why in hell
did you do it

  twenty years it was molly back
again at the door oh my god you
cant dont-dont take him away
from me-hes all ive got except the
baby george wouldnt lie sheriff ad-
ams-the fight was forced on him
she ran to the horses oh please
please-no

  the sheriffs voice was husky strain-
ed there aint nothin else i can do
molly

  lets get out of here one of the
men said mis armstrong im-well
the hell of it is george aint got any-
body to back up his say-so

  cold sweat broke out on joe kil-
dares half-starved body he thought
of the years in prison locked behind
gray stone walls shut away from all
the things he loved-the feel of a good
horse between his knees the sweep of
plain and the lift of hills the days of
hard and honest work and the com-
pany of his kind-the bitter years
when he had lived for but one thing
to come back and deal out vengeance
to the men who had wronged him

 that vengeance would be sweet
why should he meddle in this busi-
ness why should he cheat himself
out of that soul-balm that would come
to him when larsen parks and flame
halliday died-died by the gun with
which fate had provided him the
very gun by whose taking he had
doomed an innocent man to the spirit-
warping stone-walled hell that he had
the gun



endured for five long years-and molly
armstrong to a life of anguish and
torment

  joe kildare saw the accused man
his shoulders bowed swinging astride
the horse his hired hand had ridden
he saw the sheriff and the others turn
their horses heads averting their
faces from sight of the weeping wom-
an on the ground

  then from inside the house came a
wail mamma daddy

  the riders were almost out of the
ranch yard when jqe kildare stepped
from the barn door as he came on tot-
tering legs he stripped the cartridge
belt from his waist and held it out

  adams his voice was harsh loud
in spite of his weakness heres
drakes gun i took it off him after the
fight i saw it all-drake shot first
its joe kildare talkin-come and get
me-take me back

  horses wheeled came toward him
men sprang from their saddles took
hold of him half carried him into the
lamplight

  by heaven it is kildare exclaim-
ed the sheriff

  i broke out joe kildare croaked
come back-to get parks and halli-
day needed a gun-bad saw the fight
-drake shot first all right i saw it
all came here to get food rest up-
before i braced the two bastards that

framed me i dont care now-much-
long as george dont get sent up for
doin nothin like i did-

  well damn my eyes if this aint
something for the books

  the sheriffs words came to joe kil-
dare through a haze of mist in which
he wobbled so that he had to be held
up

  joe larsen parks is dead him and
that pet sidewinder of his flame
halliday had a shootin row just three
days ago something to do with money
halliday claimed larsen owed him
flame lived long enough to get some-
thin off his chest joe-he signed a
confession that proves you didnt do
that killin

  joe kildare stared at him mutely
when comprehension finally came he
closed his eyes tears trickled slowly
down his sunken cheeks

  a full pardons on the way already
joe the sheriff went on youll have
to go back to canyon city and get dis-
charged regular- then youll be a free
man

  well he wont go anywhere till
hes had a square meal and a nights
sleep sheriff molly armstrong said

  her eyes were soft and shiny reach-
ing out she took joe kildares thin
hand she lifted it to her lips

  come in joe she said come in-
and welcome

by eugene cunningham

a town-taming young hurri-
cane does his stuff to the tune
of roaring six-guns all for the
sake of the worried and dis-
tractingly lovely daughter of
palograndes head lawman

chapter one
pretty attractive-and worried

teve tormey sat the palomino
horse within two yards of the girl
his black boss stetson at his knee and
stared at her she turned at the gate
and looked at him absently at first
then with some interest

  could you tell me he put the ques-
tion again if ronnie steeles still
sheriff in palogrande

she shook a smooth dark head
something like worry came into the

clear young face the hazel eyes

  hes been dead almost a year my
father-plato mahr-is sheriff now
steves gray eyes- narrowed it
sounded almost as if she meant-and
worse luck

  im certainly surprised-and might-
ily sorry-to hear that he told her
slowly beginning to frown i mean
about ronnie bein dead not about yo
father bein sheriff i hadnt seen ron-
nie or heard from him for quite a spell
but i was ridin this way an-

  he was shot ambushed murdered

sheriff trouble



beside the road a mile or so out of
town a special election was held and
my father was elected he used to own
the general store here and he had a
great many friends you-knew ron-
nie steele very well

  she was just making conversation
he thought something was on her
mind something that weighed there
heavily he guessed that easily he
nodded

 we were boys together he was
older by five-six years but we punched
cows together along the pecos a good
man ronnie i gather nobody was
caught for that bushwhackin
nobody it was probably the whin-
rights snake and curt

  the whinrights didnt they go up
for life from palogrande why it
mustve been yo father that sent em
up

  she looked hard at him and the clear
face went dusky red but very slowly
after an instant of staring she nodded
her head

  yo father handy id like to talk to
him steve said	t

  hes downtown somewhere i sup-
pose around the courthouse are you
-an officer from anywhere

  again there was that oddness in her
tone steve looked at her thoughtfully
but he couldnt probe through to the
cause of it however much he tried
she was simply the prettiest girl he
had ever seen and about the most at-
tractive-and as worried as any he had
ever encountered

  no he said no im not an officer
but i wouldnt mind bein a deputy
sheriff in fact i sort o had it in view
to ask ronnie for a job but unless a
mans got connections in the country
its hard to land a job a stranger is
crowded out

  on impulse then he cleared a foot
from his tapaderoed stirrup and swung
down letting the split-reins fall he
stood close to her and his high-nosed
tightmouthed daredevil face softened
with a smile she frowned a little
looking up at him

  my names steve tormey he told
her an im a kind of fortune teller
im a stranger to you an yet id like
to ask you a question an not have you
feel that a stranger was tramplin in
on private property is there somethin
on yo mind that a fella about my size
an weight could help with i havent
got a thing in the world to do an the
rest o my life to finish it in so-
theres nothing she said quickly
nothing at all but what made you
think there was do i-look worried
miss mahr you do that if theres
somethin about the sheriffs job an
you dont mind tellin me-

  youre a nice-looking boy she said
suddenly i-i am worried about my
father about those whinrights

 but theyre in huntsville- did
they leave friends

  i think they did but that isnt the
thing they have sent us a message
they are going to break out of the
penitentiaryand come back a note
was pinned to our door with a dagger
saying so theyre coming back and
theyre going to kill him

  steve tormey frowned he shook his
sandy head

  lead travels both ways he sug-
gested with the warnin hes got he
can meet em with a sawed-off shotgun
an save the expense o shippin em
back to huntsville

  hes not that kind of man thats
the trouble she said almost hysteri-
cally he can handle the routine of
the office but hes not a fighter not a


all western

gunman the whinrights are deadly
the whole county walked on tiptoe
around them if they get out and come
back-oh i wish he hadnt run for the
office i wish hed let zeke ranier have
it i wished that at the time

  from the same direction that steve
tormey had approached palogrande a
horseman came he rode at an easy
running walk on a black as tall as
steve tormeys palomino horse he
was a good deal bigger man than
steve nearly six feet tall wide of
shoulder looking bigger under the
wide white stetson he wore cockily
he pulled in at the gate and stared at
them heavy squarish face unpleasant
black eyes close-set against a hooked
nose wandering over steves dusty
overall-jumper and pants he made a
rasping noise and looked at the girl

  hi lucille wheres the old man
the honable sherf

  downtown frisk the girl said
she seemed nervous now

  whos this guy frisk said with a
head-jerk toward steve he didnt look
at him steve might have been some
unimportant animal judging from the
big punchers manner

 excuse me lucille mahr said
quickly mr steve tormey- mr
frisk ranier mr tormey is an old
friend of ronnie steele frisk he
didnt know that ronnie had been
killed he came by to see him they
were old friends she repeated a little
nervous

 didnt know he was dead huh
frisk grinned lifting one side of his
hard mouth unpleasantly well steele
never knew he was alive before he
cashed

  you told him that to his face-
when he was alive steve inquired
mildly you see i dont know you

well enough to know what scars you
have got

  yeh frisk ranier snarled lean-
ing forward belligerently well i can
tell you one thing right quick mr
mouthy saddle tramp didnt none o
the z take a thing off ronnie steele
an me-well i take jist a little lessn
most off anybody

  you wouldnt have had much luck
tryin to take anything off ronnie
thats so steve grinned you an
yo whole family not monkeyin with
a real man not monkeyin with ron-
nie steele oh i play my bets clean
across-

  lucille mahr inserted herself quick-
ly between them she caught hold of
steves jumper sleeve holding it with
nervous tightness her back was turn-
ed to the big furious-faced frisk

 please dont she whispered
please

  he took his eyes away from frisk
and looked at her smilingly

  go talk to my father she said in
ordinary tone please

  steve nodded he turned and passed
the reins up over the palominos neck
and mounted with quick easy move-
ment still he held the black stetson
he ignored frisk ranier and looked at
her

  ill be seein you he drawled

  she looked at frisk then back at
him her face was dusk-red again she
nodded

  i-i hope so she said in a defiant
tone i hope so

  he rode on settling the stetson on
his sandy head he thought of ronnie
steele and his face hardened into an
ugly cast it seemed to be a nasty kind
of country or perhaps he had been
seeing only the ugly side of it frisk
ranier


sheriff trouble



  but lucille lucille- theres some-
thin to make up for a hell of a lot o
things ill be seein you i-i hope
sol no chance o her thinkin the way
i was thinkin o course what would
there be about the likes o me to make
her feel that way but can happen a
hairpin like me might have a chance

          chapter two
easy go

teve saw that palo-
grande was rather
larger than he had ex-
pected the county seat
to be there was only
one main street but
it was quite long and
on the cross streets
were good solid buildings he jogged
into the business blocks and looked to
right and left out of a big wooden
store came two men both were tall
but one was tall and black and big and
reminded steve of frisk ranier and
when he turned squarish hook-nosed
fleshing face toward the street there
was no questioning the relationship

  the other man was obviously plato
mahr the sheriff he was six feet tall
and very narrow of stooping shoulders
he was gray and his hollow-cheeked
face was warily inoffensive one long
steady stare at mahr and steve under-
stood what lucille mahr had meant
about her fathers inability to handle
such as the whinrights or any other
fast-smoking hardcases he would look
natural only in a grocers apron with
pencil over his ear

  the sheriff said something in a drab
tired voice to the big ranier he moved
on along the sidewalk and ranier with
a long stare at steve tormey went the
other way toward a saloon

  steve pushed the palomino in closer
to the sidewalk but before he came
up to the sheriff a galloping horse cut
across the street pushed by a stocky
redheaded cowboy who pulled in his
mount flashily set him down on his
tail and called mahr

  telegram he added holding out
the yellow paper operator give me
this to bring to you in a hurry sheriff
whinrights has busted out o the pen
it says

  whinrights mahr said in a thick
shaking voice his lank hand coming
out mechanically to take the folded
paper began to shake his eyes half
closed and steve saw the adams apple
in the scrawny throat bob convulsive-
ly he looked deathly sick

  the cowboy sat staring at him his
heavy mouth twitched contemptuous-
ly he shook his head and with a shrill
yell rammed in the hooks and jumped
his little buckskin ahead he went
tearing down the street to that saloon
into which ranier had vanished he
flung himself off and hitched the
horse ducked under the crossbar of
the hitch rack and swaggered in

 steve pushed the palomino in
abreast of the sheriff he looked with
grim distaste at the strained face the
blank-staring eyes the sagging mouth
and tremulous hand of mahr he
swung down

  so they busted the pen an are
headin back to pay off old scores he
drawled

  mahr did not turn did not seem to
hear

  steve repeated it pushing up direct-
ly in front of mahr

  what huh the sheriff said stu-
pidly what y want

  first steve said deliberately id
like to see you put a bone in yo back


all western

stand up like a man no matter what
you feel like aint but two whinrights
an if theyre twice as salty as the aver-
age that only makes four of em por
amor de dios man stiffen up maybe
shes not so bad maybe i can help
you some

  you dont know them whinrights
mahr said in a sick voice you dont
know em theyre jist devils twas
plumb bull-accident we got em that
time now itll be different theyll
come a-sneakin up to a winder an le
go through it theyll dry-gulch me
from alongside the trail like they done
ronnie steele they-

  listen steve said fiercely in a low
voice he put out a hard strong hand
to catch mahrs sleeves he shook it
savagely are you yellow all the way
through you aim to stand here on the
street like a kicked alley cur an howl
youre goin to be killed aint there
anything thatll make you ashamed o
yoself here i rode in aimin to ask
ronnie steele for a job as deputy ill
ask you for the same thing give me a
job as deputy an le me take the
chances o the whinrights landin in
town

  mahr blinked at steve dully for a
moment then something like interest
something like hope came into the
glassy eyes

  youre jist a kid he said then
and slumped once more

  lets go down to yo office an augur
some steve said grinning slightly i
havent got a whole load o rings on
my horns but im not worryin about
a wagonload o whinrights

  mahr nodded uncertainly he began
to walk shamblingly along the side-
walk steve mounted again and rode
after him so they came to the two-
story courthouse where a faded sign

hung over a door sheriffs of-
fice-tax assessor and col-
lector

  out of the fullness of his observa-
tion steve understood why so appar-
ent a misfit as plato mahr had run for
the sheriffs office in a county like
this the fees of the united offices
would total from two-hundred-fifty to
four hundred or even more a month

  he tied the palomino at the sheriffs
hitch rack bobbed under the bar and
went clink-clumping across the board
sidewalk into the office mahr was
standing at a long pine table he was
staring fixedly at the telegram steve
glanced flashingly around the large
bare room with its plank walls plas-
tered with dingy reward flyers its big
old-fashioned iron safe and rolltop oak
desk a barred door was in the back
wall-to the jail he thought

  he came over to the table half sat
half leaned on it he grinned easily at
mahr he was well pleased with him-
self steve was the notion had come
as lie talked to lucille at her gate to
slide into her fathers employ take the
hard and dangerous work off his hands
and see a great deal of lucille mahr
and it had worked out so simply

  now these whinrights he diwl-
ed they are probably bad enough but
at least we know theyre cornin an if
they come a-sliootin an palogrande
sheriffs office meets em shootin-
hell somebodys goin down no two
ways about that gi me a chance mr
mahr ill try to make you mightily
pleased you swore me in

  you dont look old enough mahr
objected but feebly if i got to git a
shootin depty or two to back me
up-

  ex-act-ly a grim harsh voice said
from the door
sheriff trouble



  steve turned his head a little his
face did not change except that it
hardened almost imperceptibly at the
sight of that big ranier who had gone
into the saloon

  ex-act-ly ranier said again

 he came inside he looked steve
contemptuously up and down then
he moved over to stand beside mahr
and looked him contemptuously up
and down mahr starred dully at him

  steve heard other feet outside his
eyes shuttled away from ranier and
found lucille mahr on the threshold
saw frisk ranier crowding after

  listen plato the elder ranier
said grimly soons red tol me about
that telegram about the whinrights i
knowed yuh was in plenty grief plumb
bogged down so when frisk came
along i told him what hes to do now
i do know a thing about this cowboy
but what you needs a fightin depty
an you dont need to look a bit
farthern frisk to fill that order you
swear frisk in an if them looney
gunnin whinrights hit palogrande
theyll mighty quick slide under the
daisies

  shore frisk ranier said emphat-
ically staring at steve

  steve said nothing merely looked at
the girl blankly she made a hopeless
little motion of slim shoulders and
looked away

  well i aint got a depty the sher-
iff said at last i aint aimin to run
from snake an curt whinright poison
as they be i never figgered on frisk
no but-

 well ranier said arrogantly
you can start figgerin on him now
no sense to pickin some green kid
from outside the county when the best
man in the county is willin

  a right zeke mahr nodded very

like some mechanical toy ill swear
him in an im mighty grateful

chapter three
clean-up marshal

rinning at the girl
steve slipped down
from the table and
went out he unhitch-
ed the palomino lu-
cille came out to him

  i-im sorry she
said i hoped that my
father would deputize you of course
frisk is a very efficient man but i am
sorry that youll go you were so kind
about asking me the trouble and-
and-

  shoo steve grinned id like to
have that deputys job for two rea-
sons to sort o ride herd on yo father
an because itd le me see you wantin
it a lot-wantin it moren i ever
wanted to see anybody

  ive an idea she said quickly and
she blushed go up to the store and
find mr leemans hes the-oh the
acting mayor you might call him he
runs the town as zeke ranier runs
the county ask him for the job of city
marshal its been vacant for months
but mr leemans has been thinking of
hiring someone he may not think
youre old enough but its a chance

  youre a plumb darlln steve
breathed for out of the office now
the raniers were coming but i knew
that the minute i laid eyes on you ill
take that job if i work for nothin a
year

  he passed the reins up and swung
into the swellfork kak he touched his
hat rim as he grinned at the girl then
rode upstreet

when he got down at the big store
	all western

and hitched the palomino he had only
two yards to go to find the important
mr leemans that gentleman fat
pompous red-faced and middle-aged
very similar to a turkey gobbler was
talking vehemently to an ancient cow-
man the subject steve discovered in-
stantly was the return of the whin-
rights mr leemans was agitated

  steve pushed up to the storekeeper
leemans stared at him

  mr leemans said steve thought-
fully i would like to talk to you in
private a lil bit talk to you as the
mayor o palogrande i am not a talkin
person an so i like to come to plumb
headquarters to the last word when
i say my piece

  well leemans said jerkily well
i dunnos i could say im the last
word in palogrande i aint really the
mayor you see we dont have a may-
or but-come on in young feller
steve nodded respectfully and fol-
lowed the storekeeper into the long
dusky room of the store and back to
the partitioned office inwardly he
grinned leemans sat down waved him
to another chair beyond the cluttered
desk

  o course steve said thoughtfully
its maybe like the raniers claim
that the town dont need a marshal
the raniers now that frisk is mahrs
deputy can run the town an county
theyd like to leemans sputter-
ed leaning forward yeh like to but
they aint doin it yet we can settle
about the marshal job you after it
if you feel that with the whin-
rights cornin back to wipe up the
town hit the stores an all you can use
a marshal that will ride the job plumb
steady-yeah i want it was ronnie
steele a friend of yours i know he
wasnt o the raniers

 he was a good friend leemans
nodded the raniers didnt buck him
either did you know steele

 raised with him punched cows
with him worked as stock detective
with him rode in today to hit him
for a job

  well thats all the recommenda-
tion we need you can have the job on
a months trial fifty a month whats
your name

  steve got up a few minutes later
pinning onto his dungaree jumper a
large nickel-plated shield which bore
the word marshal

  now leemans grinned at him i
feel a lot better for the talk an for
hirin you tormey you better belt on
a couple o six-shooters an when the
whinrights come in if they do come 
in pour it onto em i want you to keep
a close watch on this place because
next to mahr theyll be after me we
had plenty trouble

 steve nodded and went down the
stores length customers looked curi-
ously at the marshals badge then at
his slender-seeming middle height his
quiet brown face and his gunless ex-
terior he went out on the street got
the palomino and rode it across to a
boarding-corral where he left it

 coming back to the main street
steve met the raniers they stopped
short to gape at him frisk shook his
head dumbly

city marshal he gasped well
can you beat it leemans dont care
what he hires for marshal looks like
steve grinned he asked about the
lock-up

 you can use mine in case you
should happen to git ary prisoner
frisk said and laughed but i reckon
if you was to try and arrest somebody
itd be right hard to tell if you was
sheriff trouble



bringin in the prisoner or he was drag-
gin you somers

  steve grinned more widely but not
pleasantly he went on past them
headed for the courthouse but he
found the girl before he got there she
was coming out of a narrow-fronted
store with a package she looked first
at the glittering shield then at his
face she smiled

  thanks a lot for tellin me about
leemans he said quietly hows your
father now that hes got frisk ranier
to do all the fightin looks like itd be
a good time to take a trip

  i wish he would hes really not
well but he has a stubborn streak in
him he hates fighting he never was
a fighter he likes peace and quiet but
he knows that the county expects him
to run away from the whinrights so
hes suddenly decided to stay right
right here and-and face being killed
i wish i could persuade him to go up
to dallas or fort worth or temple
and have specialists look him over but
he wont mr tormey-

  have to be mister he asked her
softly id a lot rather you said steve
would it strain you just a lot
steve she said and flushed steve
im glad youre going to be here even
though my father says youre just a
boy that frisk makes an ideal chief
deputy and that you couldnt hope to
handle killers like the whinrights es-
pecially snake curt is bad enough but
hes nothing compared to his brother
you have to get a pistol dont you i
saw a carbine on your saddle

  i reckon your fathers right ac-
cordin to his lights steve said an
if these whinrights are so plumb dead-
ly maybe a couple shotgunsll be what
i need well ill try to be around to
kind of pick up the pieces after frisk

if hell knock em down ill stack
em- whos that doin all the yellin
she listened half turning from a
saloon two or three buildings down
the street came wolf-howls someone
was announcing himself as a terror of
the prairies she looked frowningly at
steve

  its dud abies hes zeke raniers
foreman on the z hes not a bad sort
when hes sober but he comes out and
just raises cain when hes drunk he
was the cause of the last marshal leav-
ing the marshal tried to arrest him
dud put him in the watering-trough
after hed taken the marshals gun
goodness itll be an education just
to see him steve cried his face lit
with gentle interest be seein you
dont you never think i wront uh-
you dont mind

  of course not but youre not going
to try to arrest dud

  he oughtnt to disturb the peace
like that steve said gravely likely
he just needs a word or two of re-
mindin

  he touched his hat rim and walked
briskly down to the corner of the sa-
loon he turned between it and the
other building walked down its length
to the rear and so around the corner
he entered the saloon by the back door
and stood looking toward the bar

 a squatty swaggering man red-
haired red-faced amazingly freckled
stood by himself in the bars center
he had a pistol in his hand he was
pounding on the bar and yelling fero-
ciously a pallid bartender was ex-
postulating

  shut up dud abies bellowed if
y dont like how im hammerin y
damn bar come on out an say so
howd y like fer me to take out my
knife an start whittlin on the bar or


all western

on y gizzard maybe y want to think
about things like that

  but dud the unhappy bartender
whined you hadnt ought-

          chapter four
          trough justice

rossing the space to
  the bar silently and
  swiftly steve was be-
  hind abies before any-
  one noticed him his
  hand shot out he
  twitched the pistol
  from abless hand and
  stepped back

  barkeeps plumb right he said
gently you hadnt ought to beat up
other folks property an the noise you
been makin thats disturbin the
peace you know i thought id tell
you i aim to marshal this town fair
an right ill tell you once

  dud abies had whirled with the jerk
of the gun he gaped at the slender
figure incredulously his piggish blue
eyes roved to the shield then up to
steves unconcerned face

  gimme that gun you he roared
ill bust y in two ill-

  steve stared narrowly at him then
stepped another pace backward he
bent swiftly put the colt on the floor
then walked at the z foreman abies
snarled and rushed at him steve bent
slightly caught abies about the thighs
and heaved

  the heavier man went hurtling over
steve it was his misfortune that a
round-bellied iron stove was directly
in his trajectory he struck it headfirst
and knocked it over he sprawled mo-
tionless beside it with stovepipe and
soot over all

  steve went across picked up the

pistol and stuck it into his waistband
then stopped to catch abless shoulder
he dragged him out of the mess and
looked at him then grinned faintly

  dear dear he said softly if it
didnt knock him out waters the
thing to bring him to yes sir water

  he heaved the limp figure up to his
shoulder and walked out of the bar-
room to the sidewalk the watering-
trough was ten steps away he moved
to it while behind him at the saloons
swing doors and on the sidewalks men
stood staring he stooped a trifle and
there was a mighty splash as dud
abies flopped into the water steve
watched him with anxious face he
took abless collar and ducked him
lifted him ducked him until abies
came back to consciousness with a
great thrashing of arms and tremen-
dous sputterings then steve turned
him deftly face up

  be still he said that mouth o
yours is en-tirely too big an loose-
hung im tired o hjearin so much
racket im goin to let you out now
an im not jailin you-now but you
remember one thing abies you start
raisin hell around town an ill have
you in the jug so quick itll make your
head spin

  he dragged the heavy figure over
the trough edge and let it drop abies
was a miserable-seeming caricature
of the belligerent bully he had been at
the bar blood seeped down his fore-
head and into his eyes from the gash
in his head his right hand was swell-
ing as with sprained or broken fingers
he got up painfully and all but fell
again he staggered off without a word

  good-work a voice said enthu-
siastically if softly

  it was leemans grinning like the
party of the first part in the cat and
sheriff trouble



the canary fable steve fell into step
with him and they walked toward the
store

  you better watch out for zeke and
frisk though leemans warned him
they wont like you manhandlin that
hard foman of theirs next to frisk
he wras supposed to be the poisonest
man in the country now the whin-
rights aint with us

  he turned sober instantly with men-
tion steve thought of the dread name
whinright steve paid little attention
he had almost forgotten dud abies
he was thinking hard of lucille mahr

 who is the doctor he asked
abruptly

 leemans stared at him a young
feller named higgins good boy too
athlete run like a jack rabbit and
box and wrestle and hes an all-fired
fine shot thats his office across the
way yonder

  see you after a while said steve
turning to cross the street

 steve went through the doctors
open door and a big red-haired blue-
eyed young man looked up from the
table where he was writing

  another marshal he cried an-
other sacrifice on the altar of civic
righteousness sit down-sit down
friend what was the commotion a
minute ago not dud abies trying to
put you in the watering-trough

  no-it was me puttin dud abies in
the trough but i got somethin to ask
you doc i reckon you know about the
whinrights

  about their breaking huntsville
and threatening to come back and kill
a few of us and mahrs case of shakes
and leemanss oh yes im on their
list-knocked curt whinright through
a store window one fine morning

  i didnt know that but doc im
thinkin about mahr hes all screwed
up to die like a he-ro just to show the
town he aint afraid o the whinrights
well id hate to see that i was won-
derin if you couldnt send him off to
dallas to be looked over by the special
docs up there

  hed see through that dr higgins
said shaking his head only chance i
see is that his fright will combine with
his actual poor health-or rather act
so upon it-that hell be knocked out
but if it dont- steve stopped
contemplated higgins then leaned
eagerly forward doc couldnt you
give him some medicine thatd put him
to bed for a few days

  higgins stared then began to grin
he nodded

  i certainly could do that i can put
him to bed and make him so sick hell
stay there for a while but if i do that
for you will you help me do some-
thing something the beloved sheriff
and his newly acquired deputy wont
do

  whats that steve asked

whats he done 

  hes done one murder thats of rec-
ord hell do another tonight if hes
not stopped but mahr and frisk
ranier insist hes not even in town i
know he is hes hanging out at the
toro a tough mex joint in south

me after a while down to the toro
o course if hes in town an a
murderer hes in my bailiwick its
my job-an none o yours iif go hum

  no im going too but ill keep in


all western

the background i know marquez and
you dont ready now

  before they went out of the doctors
door steve made one slight adjustment
in his costume he unpinned the shield
from his jumper and put it into a
pocket

  ill walk straight down to this toro
place he told higgins ill go in side
an look around you can stop behind
me and if you see this marquez tell
me has he got any scars or anything
no scars but hes tall almost as
tall as i his face is yellow not brown
his nose is as hooked as the raniers
family proboscis his eyes are very
small and very dark he usually wears
gray cotton pants rammed into half-
boots and i remember that he had
stars and crescents on his bootlegs
id know him in church steve
nodded lets go

  he attracted no attention when he
got to that end of the main street off
which jutted ragged cross streets lined
with unplastered dobes he found the
toro without difficulty for a blue bull
announced it-a large snorty bull on
a plank sign over the toros central
door without seeming to take care to
be quiet he came very softly up to the
door

chapter five
an old spanish custom

t the toro there was
a bar of sorts home-
made of native wood
there was a store on
the other side of the
big room there were
some homemade ta-
bles and benches and
rawhide-bottomed chairs

  steve did not need to wait for hig-

gins to identify marquez he saw him
sitting at a table face to the door and
at the table with him was that red-
headed cowboy who had brought the
telegram to sheriff mahr and who had
gone instantly to tell zeke ranier of
its contents somehow the association
seemed odd to steve

  but he went in and loafed over to
the bar stopping near the table he
could see the cowboy staring at him
when marquez looked suddenly his
way he thought probably the cowboy
had jogged the mexicans knee under
the table but he asked for tequila in
english the bartender spoke a span-
ish sentence asking what brand of
tequila he wanted

  steve shook his head impatiently
no sabe he said and again te-
quila

  he does not speak spanish mar-
quez grunted to the cowboy you say
he is now the marshal and that he
threw abies into the water trough it
does not seem possible is he one of
those fools who does not wear a gun
i do not see one about him or sign of
one i think i will amuse myself rojo
amigo-watch

  marquez came up in a lithe swift
movement he lounged over to where
steve stood with the tequila lifted in
his hand humming marquez jostled
steves elbow the tequila splashed
upon steves jumper upon his face
upon the floor marquezs face was
twisted apologetically he stepped
back flinging up both hands in a ges-
ture of concern and spoke in smooth
spanish in the tone which would be
used in an apology

  dirty cur of the alleys never yet
has there been born the gringo who
was not the fool the child beside
pedro marquez i will now play with
sheriff trouble



you for a while before with a sharp
knife i trim those ears and send you
howling back to show all the handi-
work of pedro marquez on palogrande
streets

  the listening mexicans bellowed
they leaned against the bar against
each other they dropped heads upon
the tables and roared for steves irri-
tated expression had softened he was
smiling at marquez the mexican
turned with artistically bewildered
face to stare at the laughing men
they laughed the louder the more
hysterically he shook his head and
turned back to steve

  it will be very funny that silly
ancient the sheriff he will blink and
he will say but marquez is not in
town how can a man who is not here
trim your ears ah yes it is too sad
too sad that you do not understand
the spanish

  steve gestured toward the chair at
marquezs table he moved over to it
put his hand on its back and smiled at
marquez the redheaded cowboy was
leaning back in his chair his mouth
working

  but said steve in fluent pelao
spanish who said that i do not under-
stand spanish

  he pushed sideways with his hip
the table moved catching the cowboy
off balance he fell backward the
chair came flashing up in steves
hands it crashed down upon mar-
quezs head the murderer dropped
with the groan of a pole-axed bull

  there was still the shaky silence
that had come with steves words in
spanish he stepped backward until
he was against the wall sidelong he
looked at the redhead who was furi-
ously scrambling up hand going inside
his shirt

  dont you steve snapped at him
or ill stitch buttonholes up an down
ypur bellyband

  his hands twinkled the flaps of his
jumper front twitched out of the john
wesley hardin vests slanting holsters
came twin walnut-handled colts the
one in steves left hand continued
downward l crashed across the red
head of the cowboy he slumped six-
gun falling out of his limp fingers

  aright doc steve called and
higgins stepped into the room in his
hand the doctor carried lightly and
easily the very short-barreled shotgun
which he had worn into south town
under his coat right on back steve
grinned

  ill take rojo outside first he de-
cided watch marquez a minute if
he wiggles let him have the blue
whistlers

  he reholstered the colts caught the
redhead by pants seat and jumper
back and swung him up easily he
walked through the room to the front
door and half turned letting the cow-
boy fall to the dust of the street

 he went back and with higgins
standing guard by the table took mar-
quez with left hand under chin right
hand at the back of the head he did
not lift the senseless murderer he
merely dragged him to the door hig-
gins followed there broke then a
gabble of voices within the toro but
nobody came out of the door

  there were horses in front of the
toro steve grunted and higgins went
out and got two taking down the lar-
iats from the big-horned saddles a
loop under the arms of each prisoner
a turn around the horns then higgins
went into one saddle steve -into the
other they started toward town be-
hind them in the dust the prisoners


all western

plowed along

  marquez yelled suddenly and steve
looked back at him marquez caught
hold of the lariat and jumped to his
feet steve kicked the mexican horse
into a trot then into a lope marquez
began to run faster and faster

  steve grinned tightly marquez could
do nothing but hang to tlie lariat and
try to keep his feet so they came to
the front of leemanss store steve
kicked the pony to an extra burst of
speed whirled him off to one side and
snapped marquez into the air he
threw himself out of saddle and ran
down the rope as to a calf

  he had a gun in his hand now he
rammed the muzzle into marquezs
belly searched him swiftly took a pair
of pearl-handled s self-cockers and
a dagger from him

  leemans and others from the store
porch came slowly out higgins rode
toward them with the redhead walk-
ing beside his stirrup steve grinned
at the storekeeper

  id like a couple of tug chains an
some locks i could slam marquez into
the calaboose but id rather chain him
up to the cottonwood yonder not
much chance his gettin out then

  when he had adjusted a trace chain
around the mexicans neck and locked
it then locked another chain around
the tree trunk he looked thoughtfully
at the cowboy who stood sullenly by
higgins the cowboy was a shade un-
certain of face

  what the hells this frisk ranier
demanded abruptly shoving belliger-
ently through the watching grinning
townsmen

  just try in to figurate steve said
mildly if it ought to be an arrest or
just a warnin what about it red
you still feel like teamin up with the

likes o that killer marquez or if i
let you off this time-

  if you let him off frisk ranier
cried he leaned forward a little furi-
ous-faced glaring at steve you
what the hell

  steve passed the weapons taken
from marquez to higgins then frisk
ranier jumped savagely at him hands
curled into huge knotted fists

  but steve was not there on the re-
ceiving end he slid backward snakily
twisted to one side on frisks left shot
a straight short right-hand punch
that sent frisk sideways to his knees
and one propping hand

  frisk shook his head dizzily and
jumped up steve went flashingly in
again twice he struck the big man
setting his feet hooking right and left
in terrific alternation to the two angles
of raniers jaw

  and thats that dr higgins nod-
ded how about it red

never said a word red shrugged
go climb onto your goat an pull
out o town for the day steve told
him when you come back tomorrow
come quiet

          chapter six
          fix and finish

lte that afternoon
steve again called on
higgins they sat in
the doctors parlor for
a while over a bottle
of excellent whisky
and cigars of a qual-
ity all but unknown in
the cow country when steve got up
toward dark they understood each
other very thoroughly

  watch for frisk higgins said
quietlyat the door hes a born bush-
sheriff trouble



whacker and hes got a grudge against
you steve for showing him up before
the whole town but he hated you be-
fore that-because a certain young
lady fell head over heels in love with
you pn sight

 ha ha steve said grimly i
might fool everybody in the world
doc but i couldnt fool myself no
girl like thats goin to fall in love with
me on sight

 he went dowmstreet adding under
his breath no matter if i did fall in
love with her like that

  he saw nothing of frisk as he went
to a restaurant and ate coming out
he walked down to the livery corral
and saddled his palomino to ride out
to the sheriffs house

 lucille came to the door when he
knocked

  oh she said i-i didnt expect
you

 hows your dad higgins told me
he was doctorin him

  hes really very sick not danger-
ously so dr higgins says but terribly
nauseated and very weak you-have
had trouble

  she came out onto the veranda they
sat down in a cypress porch swing
he could not see her features merely
the white blur of her face above the
dark blue of her dress

 nothin to speak about whatd
you hear

 dud abies and marquez and
frisk ranier you must be careful
about frisk-hes really a dangerous
man when hes angry- do you like
palogrande

 he put out a hand cautiously and
touched hers she pulled her hand
away and he jerked his back

  i-i certainly do as to some of the
people i cant tell though how the-

well the people i like feel about me
she stood up quickly i must go in
nd see if father wants anything she
said i-well i wouldnt worry steve
about how the people feel toward you
mr leemans-

  yes-and the others

  i wouldnt worry she repeated
and laughed not for a minute she
vanished indoors

  he rode the palomino back in con-
siderable of a daze pulling in at the
jail when he had intended going to the
livery corral but he got down and put
the palomino in the jail corral behind
the courthouse there might be a little
riding to do after all

  he walked from the jail toward the
center of town and met zeke ranier
who looked thoughtfully at him grunt-
ed and went on he made a round of
the whole town with a look at lee-
manss store coming back he was al-
most at the courthouse when in the
pallid light from saloon windows he
saw frisk ranier and a prisoner com-
ing out of the shadows that lay thick
between two buildings the prisoner a
shabby figure was reeling grotesquely

  come on you frisk was snarling
at him ill bust y damn head in a
minute come on youre goin to have
company then he stopped short and
looked at steve

  theres a prisoner ought to be
yours he growled him an some
more was tryin to get into the feed-
store back door if youll ram his rump
into the lock-up i know where the
rest went heres the keys

  steve nodded grinning faintly he
took the iron keys and the prisoners
arm leading him toward the jail frisk
vanished between the buildings again

  they went into the sheriffs office
and steve took a match from his hat-


all western

band he shoved the man toward the
center of the darkroom and the match
flared in his hand he saw the mans
movement as a blur and as the gun
flame came with the roar of the shot
he was down on one knee and to the
side of where he had been the match
was out in a snap there was a creak-
ing sound as the man shifted his
weight

  out of his pants pocket steve work-
ed hib heavy stock knife he flung it
so that it rapped the door beyond the
man then sprang up and toward the
man as he jumped he smashed down-
ward with his colts barrel downward
again and again the mans fall was
preceded by the thump of his pistol on
the floor

  a fix steve thought swiftly frisks
fix hell be cornin to sweep up the
pieces lets see now-

  he found the dropped gun rehol-
stered his own rammed the other one
into his waistband he picked up the
man and almost trotted out of the of-
fice and around the building to the
corral he clucked softly to himself
for another horse saddled was now in
the corral beside the palomino he put
the limp body across the saddle and
secured it with quick turns of the
mans lariat then he took the horses
reins and swung up on the palomino

  he rode softly out of town and into
the mesquite growth he tied the man
securely to a thick bush gagged him
with the tail of his own shirt hobbled
the horse and rode back to town
hitching the palomino behind a house
fifty yards from the sheriffs office he
moved carefully and quietly up toward
the courthouse

 there were men standing in the
darkness beside the building low
voices carried to steve as he worked

toward the men

  so i reckon shes all right frisk
ranier was saying confidently jerry
likely carted him off to hide somers
you think everybody believed you
red about droppin your gun an it
goin off

 shore they did zeke ranier
snarled time to git goin we dont
want to give leemans time to finish
countin an lock up that damn ex-
press safes like to be grief enough
they moved off steve stood staring
after them then whirled and went at a
dogtrot along the backs of the build-
ings that fronted this side of the main
street he came to the back door of the
doctors house and rapped upon it
presently the doctor spoke through it
steve gave his name

  doc if youd like some practice
with that greener slip a dozen buck-
shot shells into your pockets an come
on out the funll be at leemanss
im ahead of you higgins cried
in rather less than two minutes he was
out with steve the shotgun over his
arm

  they went quietly toward leemanss
store steve whispered to higgins who
stopped flattening himself against the
wall steve went on putting down each
foot cautiously inch by inch almost
he came to the door of the store he
heard someone breathing in the door-
way-embrasure he stiffened breath-
ing silently himself the colt lifted in
his right hand he leaned forward

  scientifically he swung the long
barrel when he had located the sen-
trys head then stepped forward and
caught the mans slumping body under
the arms he stood still holding it up
and listening from within the store
somewhere out of sight came a sudden
drone of voices he stepped backward
sheriff trouble



moving slowly supporting the limp
weight

  when he was ten feet back he set
the body down higgins came to him
steve brought out a pair of handcuffs
and gave them to the doctor

  take this hairpin somewhere you
can cuff his hands behind him around
somethin then go to the front door
an rattle it an call out ill be inside
lookin things over

  he went back as higgins picked up
the senseless lookout and turned away
he went into the door and worked to-
ward leemanss office before he
reached it he could see red the cow-
boy and another man whom he didnt
know standing outside of the office
door light came from inside to shine
on their faces odd he thought that
neither of these was masked leemans
knew red certainly

  he moved closer an unfamiliar
voice was talking

  so thats all you can rake up huh
lessn three thousand leemans
youre a double-damn liar you got the
roll for half the cowmen an saloon-
keepers in this neck o the woods talk
up or well roast your feet where you
got the real money hid

  from the front corner of the store
where was housed the express office
two men came steve could not see
their faces but nearing the door of
leemanss office they spoke

  we better take that damn safe out
into the mesquite an blow her zeke
ranier said

  hell this from frisk ranier we
could easy hide her a long way off
blow her any time dont need to
bother about tonight ill git the
hawsses

  i tell you-this was leemanss
desperate voice from within-thats

every last cent thats in the place
snake every last cent sometimes
theys more but now-

  there came to steve the flat sound
of a blow then the level almost tone-
less voice that had threatened the
storekeeper

  curt you bring that lamp off the
wall set her on the floor ram some-
thin in his mouth so he cant howl
go on an git the hawsses frisk you
an zeke snake that safe out an hide
her in the brush then cover up the
tracks me an curtll be plenty to
handle this illegitimate well roast his
feet

  steve scowled uncertainly the ra-
niers were beginning to move toward
him then from the front door came a
rattle of handle and latch and a yelling
voice demanding leemans

  slide around the grim voice
barked see who that damn fool is
bend a gun barrel over his knot-
hightail

  stick em up steve yelled stick
em up youre surrounded

  then several things happened in a
twinkling the light went out in the
office from the windows in front fil-
tered a pallid glow of street light fig-
ures moving hurriedly were silhouettes
in the passage between the counters
of the store steve squatted then the
floor in front of the office door breath-
ed flame he heard lead singing with
the roar of the guns

  he had the advantage of them he
was low he could shape them in that
dimness he fired steadily if half-
blindedly as to actual targets-right-
hand colt left-hand colt and there
was the boom of a shotgun from far
up at the front higgins was unlim-
ber ing there another boom-that
would be the other barrel


all western

  but they were running at steve now
he fired as rapidly as he could snap
back the big hammers and let them
drop a man fell across him groaning
steve gun empty snatched his hand
touched the metal of a carbine he
jerked at it got it straightened and
ran backward toward the door some-
one cannoned into him swore and re-
coiled he rammed the carbine muzzle
out felt it prod flesh cocked it and
pressed trigger then ran on

  he stood outside of the back door
carbine up someone was yelling from
the front he made out his name final-
ly-

  i-we got em cut off back here
he yelled in answer

  men came running around the cor-
ner of the store they called to him-
called him marshal he answered
curtly then sent a yell into the store

  somebody in there light a lamp
games up-we got you

  there was no answer one of the
men behind steve went down the line
and came back with a lantern when
it was lighted steve took it from his
hands and bent to set it inside the
store-

  nothing happened he slid in and to
one side someone was groaning up
near the office

  leemans steve called stooping
cautiously leemans

  all right the storekeeper answer-
ed i-im all right whos that tor-
mey

  light the lamp in there

  there was a fumbling noise the
scratch of a match then out from the
office door shone the light-upon a
huddle of bodies

  steve could see red sprawling half-
way down the stores rear section and
almost under fiis feet the man who

had stood beside red outside the door
-curt whinright it must be both
were dead

 steve went slowly up toward the of-
fice frisk ranier and his father were
lying there they had virtually been
shot to pieces he saw evidence of
many pistol and rifle slugs as well as
shotgun charges he looked in at lee-
mans who sat at his desk with one
hand feeling shakily of his blood-
dabbled forehead then he poked on

 snake whinright had almost made
the front of the store when a blast of
gunfire from the broken windows had
caught him

  calling to those outside the store
steve went back to leemans presently
the store was crowded steve listened
to leemanss tale of the holdup he
said that he had recognized every man

  funny they wasnt masked know-
in you knowed em a man comment-
ed slowly

  steve laughed harshly funny it
kinda gives the show away-them not
bein worried about his ever tellin on
em

  well thisll shore ease the sherfs
mind the man said and laughed
somebody ought to go tell him

  you ought to go steve higgins
said solemnly

  steve nodded blankly he went out
of the back door and down to the palo-
mino mounting he rode along the
street

  at the sheriffs gate a white figure
stood bathed by the light of the slow-
rising moon she looked very slender

  mop-up steve told her quietly
swinging down both the whinrights
both the raniers that fool cowboy
red at leemanss store reckon your
dadll want to know

  as he walked through the gate she
sheriff trouble



put a hand on his arm he covered it
with his hand and they walked up to
the veranda together

  inside the sheriffs bedroom steve
looked at the sick man almost his
hard mouth curved at thought of dr
higginss doing but gravely enough
he told the story of the mop-up

  the raniers plato mahr said over
and over i cant figger em they
been the biggest folks in the county so
long i knowed they wasnt havin
trouble with the whinrights ever
but- an theyre both gone well son
looks like the county owes you plenty
hadnt been for you cornin in theyd
have got poor leemans an likely me

  steve looked at lucille whistled
soundlessly moved a little and dip-
ped his hand it caught hers she began
to pull it away but he held onto it and
she relaxed though the color came

flooding to her face

  id like to stay in the county steve
said thoughtfully if youd like to
give me a chief deputys star i certain-
ly would like to settle down in palo-
grande

 course you can have the star
mahr said with the most decided tone
steve had yet heard from him but
shucks alive man like you seems to
me would want to hit the rangers

steve said just finished up seven year
in em you see quit sergeant last
month after havin about a peck o
lead shot at me i was actin capn of
y company for a year now i want to
quit raisin hell id rather settle down
an raise roses an onions an-

  he looked at lucille again and she
smiled encouragingly

  an-well other things you grow
around homes he grinned the end

broomtail rancher

back in the days when tap duncan was running the walking x iron on
more cows than there were in arizona a covboy of his acquaintance took up
horse raising in the hualapai mountains his unpopularity with the cowmen
who ran on the same open range wasnt due to his personal peculiarities or
to his fondness for other peoples beef-a fondness which after all he but
shared with every other man in the territory horses on cow range are
anathema particularly in dry years still they got along did the horse man
and the cowmen who were his neighbors-neighbors that is in the sense
that they might be found forty miles from a given point when the sign was
right

  one such neighbor cowman by trade rode up to the horse camp about
dark one day and was greeted with light and eat-got some fresh beef in
camp

  whose is it this time asked the cownan who knew the customs of the
country

  the man frying steaks in the dutch oven grinned across the fire its an-
other of old man cunninghams and im right embarrassed about it too
i been eatin genes beef all year keepin tally on the wagon tongue sos i
could tell him if he ever asked but dyou know a couple of saddle tramps
rode by the other day and i made em free of the camp whilst i was ridin-
and danged if those lazy scamps didnt burn up that wagon tongue for fire-
wood

   when a mans been branded plumb worthless by his sweethearts dad
   hell likely try to do something about it angel patmore does-with a
   vengeance

dollars to clink

by bertrand w sinclair

aybe that was foolish of me
angelo patmore murmured
still i dont know darn the luck any-
way

  he stood at the bottom of three steps
that lifted to a broad veranda running
like a gallery around three sides of a
rambling house angel had a narrow
pink strip of paper that he turned ab-
sently in thin sinewy fingers as he
took that last look he did not need to
see through the door to get the picture

 he could visualize a middle-aged
man six inches taller than himself and
fifty pounds heavier striding up and
down the room uttering blasphemous
words there was a girl sitting on a
couch with tears in her eyes and a
mixture of fear and anger on a face
that was almost plain until she smiled

-when it seemed that her features
grew illumined by some inner radiance
that always went straight to angels
heart

  angel stood for perhaps ten seconds
in the warmth of a spring noon the
trinity river flowed like molten silver
a stones throw on his right he had
come galloping down the trinity bot-
toms since sunrise that morning after
a hectic night in a little cow town forty
miles west now he shrugged his shoul-
ders and turned away

  half an hour later he was jogging
east toward post oak mounted on a
fresh horse leading a fat seal-brown
pack pony with his bed his warbag
all his few belongings lashed across a
sawbuck saddle

  halfway to post oak a rider loped

dollars to clink



out of a hollow they met on a rutted
wagon trail

   lo steve

  steve only stared he loomed like a
giant on a mount smaller than either
of angels horses he was a very tall
man with wide square shoulders
topped off by a face like a good-natured
eagles

northers his luck at poker and vari-
ous other exasperations over a three-
year period

cerned lukell be inclined to make you

hopefully

  they shook hands and parted pres-
ently angel rode into post oak april
in that latitude shed a beneficent
warmth roundup season was at hand


all western

trail herds were organizing for depar-
ture post oaks dusty street was full
of saddled horses beyond the rim of
the valley in which the trinity flowed
a dozen herds were marshaling or tak-
ing their leave for the far mysterious
northwest i-iunters were killing the
last of the buffalo up there u s cav-
alry ran down hostile redskins herd-
ing them back on reservations an un-
measured empire of virgin grass and
water beckoned to southern cowmen
from the ranges where the longhorns
crowded each other for room

  the greatest pastoral movement in
the history of the world waxed to its
zenith when angel patmore rode into
that little texas town and for a foun-
dation to a desire newborn in his
breast angel had two good horses his
riding-gear blankets a colt on his hip
and a winchester carbine under his
left stirrup leather-and a check for
one hundred dollars

  that pink slip took him back to the
curse luke karsten laid on him he
dismounted a gambling riding fool
who would never have two silver dol-
lars to clink together he shoved it
back in his pocket and walked into
morrows saloon angel thought he
needed a drink

  but he did not take a drink the
bartender leaned on his polished
counter watching five men at a green-
topped table half a dozen other men
stood about watching the players
angel looked awhile his fingers itch-
ed no matter that he had dropped
twelve hundred dollars-a years pay
for a texas roundup boss-in san
marco the night before no matter that
he knew in his soul that poker was like
a fever in his blood he looked at this
game with eager eyes three cattlemen
and two punchers they were dealing

and betting silently angel estimated
the size of the game at least two
thousand dollars variously stacked be-
fore the five if a man could clean that
game and angel had cleaned many a
poker game-as well as having himself
gone to the cleaners in others

  he walked out along the street to
the post oak county bank

  a tall thin-faced dark man in the
middle of the open floor space flanked
by a tellers and cashiers grilled
cage glared and stormed colonel john
hyams stood behind the counter with
his hands on the mahogany surface
the colonels genial old face wore a
mixture of annoyance and apprehen-
sion colonel john was strictly speak-
ing the post oak county bank-an
institution in person as well as finan-
cially he had been casting funds on
the limited waters and boundless
plains of the post oak country for two
decades and watching it come back to
him manifold with the good will of
every cattleman he dealt with

  but there was no atmosphere of
good will in that room when angel
patmore stepped through the doorway
he knew the tall dark-visaged man
he knew blind fury when he saw it
written on the human countenance
and he knew colonel john for a kind-
ly upright soul who would rather help
than harm any man

  so angels eyes dwelt curiously on
jack ratseys right arm and hand
after one glance at his flaming face he
had seen men in that same tense-
armed posture before oblivious to
everything except a venomous passion
to destroy

  hence angel was quite prepared for
what was an instinctive reaction on his
own part he knew that ratsey was
getting ready to go for his gun he did
dollars

not know what it was all about he
did not care to angel it was sheer
murder no matter what provocation
what grievance had worked ratsey up
to the killing pitch

 thus when the curving fingers
closed on the grip of the  with an
upward swoop angel whose muscular
motions were as lightning-quick as his
agile brain was drawing also

  and only one shot cracked in that
room with a flash and a roar magnified
by the enclosing walls ratsey stood
gripping his right hand with his left
his gun fell with a clatter halfway
across the house of money

  thatll be enough from you mister
jack ratsey angel said and you
two- he frowned at a cashier and a
ledger clerk who had each pulled a
gun  tend to your pencil-pushin
you were both a mile behind anyway
ratseys mouth opened in a snarl
he rubbed at his numbed hand he
glared at angel at colonel john his
fingers had only suffered from shock
he gave that hand a last tentative
shake and stooped for his gun with
that retrieved he bent burning eyes on
angel patmore slim small watchful
unsmiling angel looked like a school-
boy in riding-boots and stetson-but
ratsey knew better than that

you can go as far as you like jack
angel said softly but whats the use
of bein a damn fool twice in one day
ill see you later ratsey muttered
both of you

  ill always see you first angel
replied

  the man went out head down mut-
tering to himself colonel john looked
across the counter and sighed

  that was right smart of you an-
gelo he said you certainly kept me
from bein meat for the undertaker

to clink	

  maybe he was just aimin to run a
bluff of some kind angel suggested

  no- colonel john shook his head
-hed gone toco i know killin when
i see it in a mans eye

  lucky i happened in to cash a
check then angel said still twasnt
nothin a-tall

give your check to smith the
colonel indicted the cashier come
back into my office and have a drink
colonel johns hand shook as he
poured two drinks from a decanter

  ratsey was terrible worked up he
explained hes spread himself over a
lot of territory shootin at a fortune
stands to lose it all if he dont raise a
hundred thousand to carry him over
till fall i never did consider him a
good risk too much temper and not
enough judgment i just wouldnt let
him have any part of that sum he lost
his head

  hes sure a darned poor specimen
angel frowned pullin his gun on a
unarmed man everybody in texas
knows you never packed a pistol in
your life yes i think he was fixin to
kill you he shore looked wall-eyed

  i know he was colonel john ad-
mitted and now darn it hell prob-
ably try to kill you on sight im wor-
ried about that angel it isnt your
war

  dont worry angel shrugged his
shoulders

  youre bound to meet operatin
here in the same territory old hyams
rumbled

  maybe maybe not angel drawled
i wont be lingerin long in these
parts

  oh how come

  men lukes parted angel ex-
plained a little sadly and we parted
angry i aint nothin but a gamblin


all western

an ridin fool colonel john ive run
through twenty thousand dollars since
i come of age two years and we
locked horns finally today over grace
he says hed sooner see her in her
grave than married to a plumb no-ac-
count like me says ill never have two
silver dollars to clink together

  he repeated more of old luke kar-
stens scathing phrases that burned
him for all his nonchalance

 you been a darned good roundup
boss for him three years now colonel
john reflected luke karsten never
had a no-account that long on his pay-
roll

  i manhandled him a trifle too an-
gel confessed hes foamin at the
mouth yet i expect now mister jack
ratsey has a grievance against me too
im not goin to be popular around
these parts thanks

  this last to the cashier who laid five
twenty-dollar gold pieces before him
angel rose

  so long colonel john he said
before sundown ill be travelin
listen boy- the colonel pulled at
his white mustache towering a head
over angel what do you aim to do
go north to a new country and
make a stake angel voiced his re-
solve this is the last money i got
all i got i been a poker-playin fool
you know what im goin to do with
this hundred theres a good liberal
game goin in bill morrows place im
goin to clean it or be cleaned

  colonel john nodded comprehension
if i dont see you again angelo he
said after a little pause remember
this you done me a good turn a few
minutes ago if you got any ambition
i could help you gratify id stretch a
point

  a mans got to gratify his own am-

bitions angel said slowly he aint
much good if he needs a wet nurse
colonel john grinned and stuck out
his hand well you remember what
i said he concluded if you ever
have to holler for anything you think
of john hyams in post oak texas
ive known wild gamblin rip-roarin
kids that was pretty good men in a
pinch you do know the cow business
angel stay with that and youll wear
diamonds

  angel went a trifle warily down the
street to morrows post oak since he
shot that gun out of ratseys hand
held immediate danger for him if old
luke karsten should get to brooding
over the indignity angel had visited
on him that morning he might come
riding in also there was a matter be-
tween them that angel hated to think
about not that angel worried as he
made his way to that poker game only
being for all his years and his boyish
smallness potentially deadly in a pri-
vate war he preferred peace in any
case regardless of enemies and gun-
powder lightning pride would not
have him dodge out of post oak until
he chose to go meantime that poker
game lured him the time to gamble
he told himself was when a man had
nothing to lose possessing resources
it was better to be conservative so-
angel joined the watching crowd
with his back to the wall just in case
ratsey came looking for trouble card
sense told him in five minutes that
one cowpuncher in that game was out-
classed angels hunch was right with-
in twenty minutes there was a vacant
chair he slipped into it and slid his
five twenties across to the man bank-
ing the game small capital starting
on a shoestring angel reflected he
could go broke in one hand
dollars to clink



  a fool for luck he said to himself
within ten minutes the first hole card
dealt him was a king the second a
king kings back to back in a texas
stud game angel wore his poker face
and bet his hand like a drunken sailor
he tapped himself when the last card
fell

  angeleno you always were hell to
bluff with high cards in sight one
cowman said and called the bet

  angel more than doubled his money
on that first play on his own deal he
got every chip before him in the pot
and was called irrtwo places he could
not go wrong a queer glow began to
light him up inside he was six hun-
dred strong now and he could not be
sitting in a better game

  homer stultz across the table had
forty thousand cattle owned half a
county stultz loved stud poker for it-
self money was nothing to him paul
stratton had three trail herds bound
north stratton had once bet a trail
herd on the last card to his hand in a
stud game at abilene

  at the end of an hours play angel
patmore had half the chips on the ta-
ble piled under his chin paul stratton
was signing ious stultz humped in
his chair this was the sort of game
he liked he was winning so was an-
gel the other three were outclassed
or outlucked

  and in the middle of a hand jack
ratsey clanked in from the rear ab-
sorbed in the game angel was not
aware of him until he saw ratseys
mean eyes bent on him over a players
shoulder ratsey did not say anything
his look was enough angel knew the
signs it annoyed him but there was
nothing he could do now he did know
that something was going to be forced
-because ratsey stood waiting until

the remaining cowpuncher decided it
was too stiff a game for him and cashed
what chips he had left ratsey took his
chair and ratsey was a notoriously
poor stud player he seldom played
and never in that stiff a game the
ante was ten dollars now and the sky
the limit angel knew that ratsey was
getting in that game to ride him to
start something

  it came before long angel had the
deal ratsey sat on his right angel had
raised him out of a pot by sheer weight
of money the hand before it was rat-
seys cut now when angel picked up
the deck to deal ratsey snarled-

  set them cards down you pie-faced
rat

angel looked at him dont call
names ratsey he murmured ill
ram em down your throat if you do
you slipped that cut ratsey
growled i seen you

  if youre lookin for trouble an-
gel replied deliberately it aint nec-
essary to have an excuse nor is it
necessary to break up this game have
some sense

  for answer ratsey slapped him
across the mouth paul stratton clamp-
ed him with one powerful arm and
stopped his draw angel sat white-
faced shaking with sheer anger at the
stupid vindictiveness of the man then
he got up

  let him go he said

  no both stratton and stultz de-
clared its a good game and no damn
fool like him is goin to break it up
that way get to hell outa this saloon
ratsey and stay out till this stud game
is ended then if you wanta shoot it
out with this patmore kid go to it
itll be your own funeral

  ratsey tore himself loose his face
livid you blamed runt he shouted


all western

if youre in post oak moren another
hour ill drop you in your tracks
they watched him out the door and
dealt again no one commented on the
incident angel shook it out of his
mind he would not get out of post
oak without burning powder now but
it did not crimp his play in another
hour stratton and the strange cowman
grimaced uncomfortably and cashed in
their few remaining chips stratton
made out a check to bearer and gave it
to stultz who was banker

  we resign he said youn angelo
are too many for us besides i got
business to attend to bet em high
boys an sleep in the street

 it narrowed to angel and stultz
they played four hands angel won
three pots then he laid down his last
hand

  i dont like single-handed stud for
one thing he said for another i got
ratsey on my mind youre winner a
little stultz im winner a lot and it
means something to me do you mind
if we close the game

  hell no stultz grinned im just
playin for pastime

  angel cashed in filled his pockets
with gold and silver and banknotes-
to say nothing of paul strattons check
he loosened his gun in its scabbard
and turned to the door

  hey kid stultzs voice was like a
hiss in his ear

  angel whirled ratsey had come in
from the rear his gun was flashing to
a level angel felt his hat whirl off his
head

  if ratseys speed and accuracy had
been equal to his ferocious intent an-
gel patmore would have been an added
unit to the small company on post
oaks boot hill he left angel no
choice being earnest in his desire to

live his allotted span angel did his
best left to himself he would no more
have tried to kill jack ratsey than he
had tried to kill him in colonel johns
bank but this was a case of kill or be
killed and so it was ratsey who went
down in the bluish haze from two spit-
ting guns

  angel knew he would have a feud
on his hands later ratsey had rela-
tives right or wrong any texans kin
could be depended upon for reprisal
so angel standing gun in hand re-
sentfully concluded that the climax
had been reached and his immediate
exit from post oak ordered both by
destiny and prudence

  so he hurried to the livery stable
repacked and saddled

  well he said to himself if i head
north and keep going ill live longer
abreast of the county bank he halt-
ed an impulse partly born of luke
karstens contemptuous summary of
his nature and deeds and partly from
that poker fund heavy in his pocket
gave birth in his brain to an idea he
strode through the doorway colonel
john peered cautiously from his pri-
vate office and came out to meet
angel

  i got ratsey angel explained
he jumped me roughshod all i could
do was defend myself so im splittin
the breeze for foreign parts

  stand pat colonel john advised
stand your trial youll come clear
only mean more gunplay later
angel said i know the ratsey tribe
no im on my way i was goin any-
how i beat that poker game colonel
john bank my money for me will
you

  h-m colonel hyams grunted as
angel disgorged hia winnings you
sure did
dollars to clink



  six thousand three hundred and
thirty angel finished counting ill
take the three hundred and thirty with
me im a gamblin fool colonel john
luke was right

  i wouldnt say a fool son the old
man murmured

  fool or not angel said seriously
i have played my last poker touched
my last card for money that aint a
promise to nobody its a plain state-
ment of fact ill show that old high-
binder sittin on the trinity river im
good for somethin besides gamblin
and ridin never have two silver dol-
lars to clink together ill show him
if i can see an openin in the cow busi-
ness somewhere colonel john would
you consider lendin me as much cap-
ital as i got on deposit

  i have backed poorer risks in the
cow business than youll ever be an-
gelo hyams said without hesitation
you can draw on me through any
bank

  you sure mean that angel asked
a trifle incredulously

  colonel john nodded

  ill remember that angel replied
maybe ill call your bluff im headed
for montana but dont tell nobody
where im gone i dont want no more
fire-eatin ratseys on my trail

  and he was gone with a deposit slip
for six thousand dollars in his pocket
and the colonels last shout was to the
effect that it was no bluff

  in a month angel was skirting the
fringe of colorado on a fork of the
republican river he fell in with a
trail herd-two thousand longhorns
short-handed with an unruly crew a
feeble ineffective trail boss welcomed
angel like a long-lost brother he went
to work as a hand in a week he was

virtually in charge by sheer energy
and one brief display of force he
whipped a dozen snarling shirking
disgruntled riders into an orderly ef-
ficient crew long before they turned
the eastern fork of the bighorns and
marched down to the yellowstone
twelve hundred miles in an airline
from post oak sixteen hundred as a
herd traveled a distance from his goal
not to be measured in miles

  sometimes angel would look at the
little picture of grace karsten he car-
ried in his watch case then he would
hear old lukes contemptuous epithets
never have two silver dollars to clinic
together plumb worthless except to
ride and shoot and play the fool a
man that had had a small fortune
handed to him on his twenty-first
birthday ought to have something and
be somebody damned gamblin pup

  angels face would burn a little
funny he had never thought of him-
self as being measured by what he had
-by what he could acquire in material
possessions where would he be any
different if he had ten thousand cattle
and a hundred thousand dollars in the
bank he would still be angelo pat-
more no better no worse

  well it was not that angel con-
ceded so much to old lukes estimate
it was a game you beat it if you were
up and coming if you werent-

  gosh shes a big country angel
would say then staring over a thou-
sand square miles of unfenced pasture
from a little rise on the rolling plains

  not a rider in sight not a house no
life but wolf and jack rabbit and bands
of antelope the buffalo were gone and
the longhorns were moving in empty
from dawn to sundown for a hundred
miles in every direction twinges of
homesickness would seize him then


all western

he would square his shoulders

  when the herd rose dripping out of
the yellowstone within sight of miles
city the little fussy trail boss rode for
town he did not come back that night
angel grazed the herd ten miles north
to a night camp in the morning he
galloped into miles found his boss in
a hotel room with a broken leg his
horse had fallen on him a military
surgeon had set the fracture

  im here for two months darn the
luck the trail boss complained you
take the herd on angelo you been
same as runnin the layout anyway
id never a got that herd this far with
that crew i was expectin to meet slee-
man here but he aint showed up
cross the missouri at fort benton an
get further orders there so long
angel was two days north of miles
when a big red-faced man rode into
his noon camp and handed him a note
it ran

this here is george sleeman of fort
worth he owns this herd of xp two-
year-olds youre handling

                       yours truly

                     -d ayres
well angel said there they are
in good flesh an movin north mr
sleeman whats your pleasure
theres darned little pleasure for
me in the cow business these days
sleeman said morosely i just come
out to see if you was any improvement
on that poor stick thats layin in miles
with a busted leg

  angel said nothing to that he knew
men and their moods he perceived
that sleeman had something on his
mind that did not sit well it was not
angels business to make talk-only to
take orders 

  whod you ride for down south
sleeman asked abruptly

  id as soon not tell you angel said
frankly i was forced to down a man
and i dont want his kinfolk gunnin
for me up here but i was a roundup
boss three years in texas

  if you was a range boss in texas i
reckon you can handle a trail herd for
me sleeman conceded

  i can handle a trail herd for any-
body angel replied coolly if they
tell me what they want done an leave
me do it

  trail em to fort benton n hold
em around there till you hear from
me thats all i got seven herds strung
between southern wyoming an the
missouri river right now im cattle-
poor and i kinda miscalculated the
strength of my hand ive got to try
an turn one of these herds into cash
angel watched a hundred sleek two-
year-olds string past

  i wouldnt mind ownin this bunch
myself he said a bit wistfully you
could keep the other six herds an
welcome

  ill sell em to you dirt-cheap slee-
man bent an inquiring eye on him
you got any money kid

 now the conjunction of money and
cattle revived in angels mind instant-
ly the very look and tone of colonel
john hyams and angel thought fast
letting his imagination play

  i dont carry the price of two thou-
sand cattle in my jeans he said
maybe i could raise it in a few days
whatll you take for the outfit herd
saddle stock an wagons

  sleeman chewed his under lip for a
second for cash down ill make you
a gift he said at last twenty thou-
sand dollars

  nobody knew better than angel pat-
more just how much of a gift those
two thousand s were at that price
dollars to clink



he sat a little straighter in his saddle

  id have to go back to miles with
you where theres a telegraph line
he said i can raise that much i think
not sure but ill try

  if you could raise twenty thousand
cash to take this herd off my hands
id pay your railroad fare to texas an
back sleeman said feelingly i need
hard cash young feller and i need it
bad

  from miles city angel wired colo-
nel john hyams briefly

  can buy two thousand two-year-olds
of george sleeman at snap price un-
limited range up here for taking need
twenty thousand deposited in miles
city montana bank to close deal give
you note and mortgage on brand as se-
curity or operate on shares if you like
will wire details if interested

-angelo patmore

  twelve hours twenty-four hours
colonel john might be out of town
maybe it was out of sight out of mind
and it was good business the kind
the post oak county bank dealt in as
a matter of course angel could see
that investment doubled perhaps
trebled in three years off that herd
but it was a long way to post oak
angel went to bed the second night
with gloom for company

  but as he sat eating breakfast the
cashier of a newly opened bank in
miles city sought him out you mr
angelo patmore he inquired

  angel nodded

  expect any important communica-
tions from anybody anywhere the
man asked guardedly

  angel looked at him a moment and
took a chance im expectin twenty
thousand dollars to my credit from
colonel john hyams of the post oak
county bank in texas he said calm-

ly has she arrived

 she has arrove the cashier
smiled you can draw on us for twen-
ty thousand providing you can iden-
tify yourself

  angel could and did he rode out of
miles that afternoon with a bill of sale
in his pocket the owner of two thou-
sand mixed two-year-olds a hundred
saddle ponies and a chuck wagon-
and a cash balance of six thousand in
texas to run on

  im in up to my neck angel said
over and over its sink or swim be-
cause ive got the colonels money
runnin on four legs i got to make a go
of this

  it was not so easy two men in the
crew had been up the trail to miles the
previous season none had ever been
north of the yellowstone for three
hundred miles angel had to grope his
way he knew that fort benton lay on
the missouri river sleeman told him
that north of benton especially along
the marias unoccupied grazing land
well watered spread for two hundred
miles

  free grass free land free water
no taxes no wonder the southwest
was moving north there was more
gold in the grass roots angel knew
than the placer miners ever sluiced out
of last chance and virginia city so
he moved on with his herd looking
for a prime location

  when he swam them over the big
muddy half a mile below benton an
elderly man sat his horse on the bank
to watch the crossing he nodded to
angel when that young man punched
out the last of the drag

  youre quite a kid to be runnin a
trail herd for sleeman he commented
when he found out who was trail boss

  me angels amusement at the


all western

tricks his boyish face and diminutive
stature played on strangers rippled his
face in a smile im runnin this herd
for myself

  sleemans road brand the stranger
pointed out

  was angel corrected i bought
this outfit off sleeman at miles

 oh the cowman grinned time
youre growed up youll have plenty
cattle

  what i lack in size angel retort-
ed i make up in speed ask them
that know me

 i will when i know who to ask
about the old man replied my
names gray i range the diamond g

  mines patmore angel returned
and where ill range this bunch i
dont know yet

marias gray said genially neigh-
bors is darned scarce patmore eh

range boss for luke karsten

  yes angel admitted but i am

trinity before i left theres folks

family is clannish i knowed you right
off happens i was in post oak that
day started two trail herds south from
there i watched that poker game
awhile wont advertise you kid old
luke talked to me about you after
that

  he would angels bitterness was
not so keen but it still lingered i
know about what hed say plumb
worthless never have two dollars to
clink together

  gray looked him over thoroughly be-
fore he replied you got two thousand

head of cattle accordin to your own
say-so he observed

  ill have more byn by angel
frowned ill show that old trinity
river hardshell a man dont have to
grow a beard an look sour to make
money in the cow business

  gray laughed well dont forget the
diamond g ranch at boulder cross-
ing he said its a lonesome country
a neighbor or two would be welcome

  angel did not forget he loaded fresh
supplies in fort benton crossed the
teton drew north to the marias with
the hump of the goosebill a landmark
on the western sky line and threw his
herd in on a broad river bottom when
the first nip of autumn frosts was in
the air of nights

 no surveyor had as yet squinted
through a transit in that region it was
public domain free for the taking
angel rode miles up and down the
marias picked a spot where crooked-
 imbed cottonwoods and compact
groves of poplar gave him both shade
and building material-hard by a nat-
ural meadow where with a mower and
rake he slashed down and stacked a
hundred tons of hay while the rest of
his crew labored with ax and hammer
and saw in an incredibly short time
he had a house of sorts a stable a set
of corrals created by that magic which
the frontiersman carries in his hands
and brain

  then with no more to do for his
cattle must care for themselves till
spring he paid off his texan crew
gave them railroad fare home and let
them go when they began to shiver in
the first winter winds two men elect-
to stay the others were sick for the
south and departed gladly after which
angel sat down to compose a letter to
colonel john hyams
dollars to clink



  any tiijie you want your money out
of this stock proposition let me know
i can turn em over at a profit anytime
unless a hard winter hits me i aim
very soon to get myself crowned as a
cattle king this is one grand coio
country i had an idea it was like the
north pole but barring colder winters
its got texas backed off the map for
grass water and timber

  and a great deal more because an-
gel was truly in love with montana
when he wrote to grace karsten he
talked more of himself and less of the
country he told her that if his mind
and body were in montana his heart
was still on the trinity river

  having dispatched those letters an-
gel somehow felt blue and forlorn the
marias seemed suddenly a most god-
forsaken wilderness in which he was
doomed to struggle with bad weather
straying cattle all the contingencies of
a desperate undertaking merely to
prove to himself and a stubborn old
fool in texas that he was a man and
not a wayward child

  so angel saddled his best horse and
went visiting

 he was used to women there were
sisters in his family also there was
grace karsten so that angel was
pleased and surprised rather than em-
barrassed to find every man of the
diamond g absent except the cook
and a slim imperious-looking wisp of
a girl asking him to stable his horse
and make himself at home after the
custom of the cow country

 youre angelo patmore arent
you she sat across the table where-
on she had placed beefsteak and corn-
bread and coffee hot from the cooks
range im molly gray

  why yes thats me angel replied
youre a good guesser

  i saw the brand on your horse
said molly besides grace karsten
told me quite a lot about you in fort
worth just after you quit the luk
i didnt quit angel corrected
luke fired me

  well you quit the country molly
returned like a fool

  like a no-account fool angel in-
toned he had the impression that
molly gray did not know about his
run-in with jack ratsey or she would
not have said that thats what old
luke said i was hed be glad to know
somebody agrees with him i dont
molly cupped her hands over her
chin and stared at him she had dark-
gray eyes and black hair and a mouth
like a slash of carmine

  come to think of it now that i see
you personally perhaps grace was the
fool she said after a minutes con-
templation that almost made angel
uncomfortable

  but she did not say why and angel
deftly changed the subject but he
wondered what the devil she meant
just the same

  at dusk gray came in with half a
dozen riders they yarned around the
fireplace till midnight when angel
left next day molly said to him dont
forget where we live

  nor did angel forget his horses
hoofs made many a track to the dia-
mond g through the snows of that win-
ter going and coming he would turn
aside here and there to look at little
bunches of xp cattle making shift
against the wolf and the blizzard nos-
ing for grass in loose snow wild cattle
in a wild country

 a gamblin fool he said once
scornfully why every cowman from
here to the rio grande is gamblin
from season to season on weather and


all western

water and grass the winds and the
rains can make him or break him
whats the difference between cattle
and cards

  and once he snapped the case of his
watch to look at grace karstens face

  no old girl im not foigettin he
muttered to himself

 spring brought blue windflowers
and green grass and the muster of
roundup angel joined forces with the
diamond g gray led his roundup crew
for a month he had fifteen thousand
cattle north of the big muddy as
many more in the south he was past
sixty and weary of saddle work he
said to angel patmore

  youre younger and swifter than i
am run this outfit for me

 and angel ran it at a bank man-
agers salary and took care of his own
stock besides that season and the
next

  when beef gathering closed at the
end of the third summer and the last
returns came in from the chicago
dealers angel took stock his original
herd had been made up of one thou-
sand two-year-old steers one thousand
heifers his thousand heifers had bred
so that he now owned twenty-six hun-
dred head of stock cattle his thousand
steers less a few winter-killed had
netted him thirty-five thousand dollars
in the market he could repay colonel
john hyams with interest at seven per
cent and still have a comfortable bal-
ance in the bank and more cattle un-
der his individual brand than he
started with

  luke karsten said i would be no-
account he told molly gray never
would have two silver dollars to clink
together well ive proved him plumb
mistaken im goin south and make
the old hombre eat crow

  therell be a lot of satisfaction in
that i suppose she said gravely

  satisfaction say what you think
ive sweated in summer and froze my
fingers and cheeks in winter in this
darned north-pole country for angel
demanded for the fun of thething
i know pleasanter countries to make
a livin in i was raised in texas im
goin back

  to stay molly asked

  well that depends angel said
thoughtfully i got a good start here
i wouldnt like to close out i guess ill
be back in the spring

  dont go angel molly said slowly
i was in fort worth last winter-
in post oak too jack ratsey has two
brothers there they have made their
talk they havent forgotten that kill-
ing

  i got to go angel murmured i
promised

  youve been up here three years
molly told him it wont be the same
a woman isnt like a tree you dont
plant her and go back long after to
find her with her roots in the same
spot

  angels cattle were bunched pretty
close around his own ranch his orig-
inal meadow had grown to several
hundred acres of irrigated hayland
he had five hundred tons of winter
feed stacked for a hard-weather emer-
gency he had four riders hand-picked
for the job there was nothing to hold
him

  eventually he landed in san marco
the nearest point to the trinity he
could reach by train from there he
headed for the luk and post oak very
much as he had left it on the back of
a horse in san marco he met men he
knew riders with whom he had work-
dollars to clink



ed the range they passed him without
recognition

  whats the matter with me angel
asked himself fretfully folks dont
know me any more

  angel pondered as he rode down into
the trinity valley of course people
changed he could feel change in him-
self but not in most things tenaci-
ously he had clung to a determination
to show luke karsten that he could
laugh lightly ride like a fool and still
be a man in a mans world the invisi-
ble thread that linked him to grace
was like a chain mr strength-had
been for three years only for that-
molly gray-he recalled her last
words a man could interpret them in
various ways angel thrust that out of
his mind the feeling that he was
about to prove himself set his shoul-
ders back and his head up as he rode
into the luk dooryard

  change here yes angels keen eyes
noted sagging barn doors and broken
fence panels the luk sat on a bald
flat the dry fall wind blew texas dust
in little swirls from under his horses
feet the trinity looked gray shrunk-
en where he remembered it as spark-
ling like molten silver a man a tall
thin-faced man with a face like a good-
natured eagle stood in the door of a
bunkhouse-steve murray he said
howdy stranger put up your horse
its high noon

  steve did not know him something
in angel tightened up

  luke karsten home he asked
  yeah over in the house

 gosh angel breathed and rode
the fifty yards to the old ranch house

 he swung down by the same three
steps he doffed his hat in the door-
way old luke gtood with his back to
the fireplace where a yellow flame

flickered in a sooty cavern the old
mans bearded chin was sunk on his
broad chest

  hello luke angel greeted

  i dunnos i can place you karsten
stared at him a few seconds you look
familiar too

  lord lord angel cried have i
slipped a few years like rip van
winkle im angel patmore luke
karsten walked aroimd him into a
better light why so it is he said
darned if it aint

  last time you and me talked right
here in this room angel reminded
you give me hell luke you said i
was nothin but a gamblin fool that
id never have two silver dollars to
clink together and i told you id show
you

  i remember old luke nodded
you still sore at me because i got
mad an tore into you angel asked
diffidently

  karsten shook his head a ghost of
a smile flitted across his face

  well im back angel issued his
ultimatum i come back for grace
where is she i sent her a wire from
chicago

  yeah she got it old luke rumbled
so you got cows of your own now
a couple of thousand head angel
told him casually a ranch in mon-
tana and cash in the bank i aint
braggin luke im just tellin you to
show you you were wrong about me
karsten stared at the floor i reckon
i was he said at last and only angel
knew what a concession that was from
that stubborn old cattleman who had
known him since he was knee-high to
a grasshopper

  youve done all right old luke
continued i havent done so good
since you left here used poor judg-


all western

ifient itch got among the luks an
raised old ned im closin out here on
the trinity thinkin about makin a
fresh start up north in the spring
anywhere north of the yellowstone
is made to order for cattlemen angel
said shes a gold mine wheres
grace

  you dont want to see grace he
muttered

  the hell i dont angel exploded
you still got somethin stickin in
your crop shes past twenty-one
yes and married three months
ago old luke blurted out married
to bob ratsey brother to the feller
you downed in post oak the day you
quit the country im sorry angel
angel patmore stood for ten seconds
as if he had frozen in his tracks his
body was taut immobile but his mind
was not he could see the whole se-
quence like pictures flashing before
his eyes out of sight out of mind all
his struggle his self-discipline his
achievement gone by the board once
more he had gambled and lost yet he
did not feel the pangs of a loser that
puzzled him

  why he thought to himself i ought
to be as mad as a hatter or plumb
brokenhearted gosh darn it what
kind of a feller am i anyhow

  aloud he said well its a free coun-
try but she might have told me i
reckon ill travel

  have a drink before you go old
luke offered

  they lifted glasses by a sideboard
angel looked at the red liquor at luke
karsten at the room which had once
seemed the most homelike place on
earth and which he now perceived to
be shabby uncared-for less attractive
by far than his own log house on the
marias he looked out the window at

miles of brown flatness at a dust ban-
ner streaming where a rider fogged a
bunch of horses toward the luk cor-
rals it was all over there was not any
shouting he had come two thousand
miles to draw a blank

  heres lookin at you angel kar-
sten gulped his drink

  heres how luke angel drained
his glass put on his hat turned to the
door so long

  two miles along the trail to post
oak angel stopped to look back a
whimsical noticri made him laugh
aloud he took two silver dollars out
of his trousers pocket and jingled
them in the palm of his hand

  nothin but a gamblin fool never
have two silver dollars to clink to-
gether he said thoughtfully well
he was wrong i proved him wrong
but it dont mean nothin to anybody-
only to me i reckon

  only to himself angel suddenly felt
a vast sense of relief a profound grati-
tude as if some weight had rolled off
him he did not quite know why it
took him some time to get that figured
out it was a simple conclusion he ulti-
mately reached certain things that
happened to a man were just growing
pains

  she said a woman aint like a tree
you dont plant her and go back long
after to find her roots in the same
spot angel murmured now i won-
der was she referrin to grace-or to
herself

 he swung his horse about and
pointed straight for san marco the
nearest railroad point all at once im-
petuously eager to get back to the
marias angel wanted to prove one
thing more to himself-and this time
he was not going to take three years
to reach the point
one good turn deserves another says the old maxim-but mina colcord
thinks of something bigger and finer than that when she holds grat
spanes fate in the hollow of her hand

 raw land

by harry sinclair drago

ith the short afternoon of this
wild snow-lashed january day
drawing to a close mina colcord a
fevered look in her dark eyes watched
from her kitchen window as her hus-
band floundered through a waist-high
drift on his way to the barn to feed
the horses he was a clumsy grotesque
figure in his big sheepskin coat his
hat tied to his head with the bright
woolen muffler she had knitted for him
that christmas

  a sharp sword-thrust of pain ran
through her young body as she stood
there thinking she was going to faint
she pressed the rounded softness of
her cheek against the glass and was
grateful for its coldness it was her
second warning that her hour of mar-
tyrdom was much nearer than she had
supposed in the early afternoon she
had not been certain now there was
no mistaking the clutching of the tiny
hands of her unborn

  last evening before the storm
struck they had decided to start for
town in the early morning asa want-
ing her to have the best of care and
not minding the extra expense for he
had done well on this little ranch on
ute creek the storm had brought
their planning to nought but believ-
ing that another day or two did not

copyright  i

matter it had not seemed important

  all that was changed now and
mina found herself facing the terrify-
ing fact that the doctor was thirty-five
miles away in ruby city-long cow-
country miles-and not even a woman
nearer than mrs macglashin at the
ox-bow high in the calico hills

  in the pleasant summertime mina
had visited there a -ride of less than
two hours she had not mentioned it

ies inc


all western

to asa but she had hoped that a lull
in the storm might permit him to go
for old mrs macglashin she would
come if she knew she was needed

  and im going to need her so des-
perately mina murmured digging
her fingers into the window frame

  with the coming of evening the
growling of the wind had risen to a
shrill soprano scream all day long it
had raged at the corners of this snug
stout house that asa had built for her
here in the lee of the ute creek bluffs
listening to its baffled fury she told
herself that never in the three years
since he had brought her to this new
home a bride of eighteen had there
been such a blizzard as this

  having in mind these bad storms of
winter asa had built the house close
to the foot of the bluffs he often spoke
of how protected they were his words
coming back to her now made her
wince if they were protected here
what must it be like out in the hills
and on the big flats where the full
sweep of the wind had play a glimpse
of him his shoulders hunched and his
head lowered throwing all his great
strength against the storm fighting for
every foot he gained filled her with a
crushing awareness of her complete
isolation thered be no fetching mrs
macglashin tonight in her minds eye
mina could see that mountain road to
the ox-bow choked with snow per-
haps long since blotted from sight it
made her realize how foolish she had
been to think of it

  asa pulled down a generous quan-
tity of hay for the horses he had to
break the ice in the pails before he
could water them he cleaned out the
stalls then the scouring snow had
rubbed his face red working his

  breath steamed on the frosty air the
scraping of the shovel every sound
even the munching of the horses had
the sharp ringing clearness that comes
only with great cold

  he went to the barn window when
he had his chores finished it was white
with hoar frost raising his sleeve he
rubbed away the rime peering
through the cleared space he could see
the near-by creek where the snow had
piled up against the willow brakes in
great drifts eight to ten feet high his
steers were somewhere along the
creeks drifting with the storm he
knew he was bound to lose some but
in his concern for mina he was only
dimly conscious of the plight of his
cattle

  a momentary eddying of the storm
gave him a glimpse of the flats beyond
ute creek there were brown spots
out there where the frozen hard-
packed earth was showing the sight
heartened him

  thinking aloud he said a team
might get through itll be tough going
but it is a chance and then with
bitter self-reproach we should have
started an hour ago theres no bring-
ing the doctor here

  in such a storm they might easily
lose their way death would be the in-
evitable penalty in all that first twen-
ty miles to dutchmans ford there
wasnt so much as a sheep camp

  i know the country too well to get
lost he argued ill find the ford all
right its terrible asking mina to make
the trip but-

  he broke off abruptly struck by a
sudden thought there was a back-
country saloon at dutchmans ford a
saloon and nothing else it bore an evil
reputation but that was beside the
point on a night like this soapy tap-
raw land



per would have a big fire going the
last time he had passed the place he
noticed that soapy had it well banked
with sod it would be warm even to-
night they could stop there for a few
minutes and thaw themselves out he
knew how mina would feel about ever
setting foot in that saloon but this
was no time to be swayed by such
prejudices he wondered why he had
not thought of it beforp

  he made his decision instantly it
placed a great responsibility on him
but he felt strangely relieved running
to the feedbox he filled a battered pan
with oats for the team spilling some
in his haste he had not been grain-
feeding the horses of late but theyd
need something to keep them warm
tonight he put the pole in the light
rig then and filled the wagon box with
hay over it he spread an old buffalo
robe and over that a second robe
well tucked in mina would be warm
enough in the wagon

  for himself he placed a blanket on
the seat he could wrap it around his
legs he put a shovel in the wagon
carrying the double harness into the
stall he tossed it on the team

  it did not take him long to hitch
the horses were long in hair the wind
fluffed it and flattened out their manes
as they stood waiting while he closed
the barn door with some urging he
got them started and drove up to the
house habit was strong in him and
he paused to knock the snow from his
boots before he stepped into the kitch-
en mina sat at the table the color all
gone from her face

 mina youve had another bad
spell he said anxiety tearing at him

  im all right now she answered
she raised her face and smiled he
looked so grave and sorry standing

there as though he were responsible
for her suffering she laid her hand
against his cold cheek you mustnt
be afraid asa youve got to help me
to be brave maybe the storm will blow
itself out before morning

 his heart was in his eyes as he
gazed at her mina ive hitched the
team im taking you to town ive got
some hay and the robes in the wagon
well take some blankets from the
house when we get to the ford ill
carry you into tappers place until you
get warm

  mina stared at him aghast slowly
she shook her head no asa-no we
couldnt make it-and that saloon-in
my condition those men-

  mina were going he said his
voice harsh with an authority he had
never used to her before theres no
other way

  no asa please she insisted its
brave of you to offer to take me i
know you are thinking only of me but
ive got to think of the baby

  im thinking of both of you thats
why were going youll need some
things tell me where they are and
ill put them in a bag for you

  he sounded so sure of himself she
couldnt remember when he had ever
failed her it made her believe he must
be right now

 very well she murmured as she
rose well go suddenly her arms
went around his neck and she kissed
him fondly ill get the things she
said ill feel better if i walk a little

  night fell suddenly soon after they
crossed the creek but asa had taken
his bearings he had the wind at his
back now and knew he could not go
far astray as long as he kept it there
the team had settled down to its task


all western

and moved along without much urging
from him

  at long intervals he found traces of
the road there was no keeping to it
time after time the drifts forced him
to strike off across the flats he spoke
to mina she said she was warm the
cold was getting into his bones when
he could stand it no longer he got
down and trotted alongside the horses
once the team stopped and could not
be urged forward he went ahead and
sank in the snow to his armpits he
knew this dry wash it told him exact-
ly where he was knowing he could
not hope to find a way across he had
to quarter and swing far around it

  it all took time he could see that
the horses were tiring and fully half
the distance yet to go but the valley
was widening and the great force of
the wind was scouring the flats clean
he got back on the wagon and used
his whip for the better part of an
hour they made fairly good time the
bitter cold was slashing at him but he
didnt mind mina was warm and rest-
ing easily and they were getting
through nothing else mattered a few
minutes later the team balked at a
drift he got out his shovel and went
ahead to dig a way through

  back in the wagon mina pushed
back the blankets and robes and raised
-jierself on an elbow she was in great
pain seeing they had stopped she
called to asa but the wind wiped
away her pitiful cry before it reached
his ears the mad urge to get out of
the wagon and run and run until she
fell exhausted in the snow almost over-
came her but the spell passed and
when asa put his shovel under the
seat she lifted her head again and
spoke to him

  how long have we been here she

asked raising her voice to make her-
self heard above the whooping of the
wind

  he had to work his jaws before he
could answer not long he said his
words all blurred with cold about
two three miles more with his mit-
tened hand he brushed the snow off
the robe

  youre freezing to death asa
mina cried i wouldnt know your
voice let me drive the team awhile
you get under the robes and warm
yourself

  ill make out was all he said but
as he trudged along beside the horses
he told himself that no man had such
a wife as he

  repeatedly he shouted at the horses
and slapped old belle on the withers
trying to coax more speed out of them
it was to no avail he knew the whip
would have no better effect bucking
the drifts and wallowing through
snow that was belly-deep on the level
for miles had taken everything out of
the animals knowing horses he real-
ized that the team would never get
them to town every passing minute
made it plainer indeed the fear grew
on him that they might not even make
the ford

  in the wagon wide awake mina lis-
tened to every turning of the wheels
how slowly the horses move she
whispered

  asa walked all the time now not
wanting to add his weight to the
teams load it was all he could do to
drag himself along if he needed any-
thing to tell him how far gone he was
it came a few minutes later when he
missed his footing and sprawled full
length in the white smother it was
the first of many times that he went
down
raw land



  he told himself that he should be
seeing soapys light with squinting
eyes he tried to peer through the hiss-
ing flakes he could see nothing

  be right on top of it before i locate
it tonight he muttered brushing
away the fringe of ice on his brow
his thoughts did not go beyond dutch-
mans ford he knew he might find
some horses there but they would be
saddle stock and not broken to harness
what they were going to do he didnt
know it seemed relatively unimpor-
tant compared to the driving necessity
of reaching the ford

 he wondered how cold it was the
snow had an icy edge he could hear it
strike his coat and drift off with an
abrasive rustle he had seen this coun-
try show its fangs before and it had
not made him love it any the less his
loyalty to it did not waver now but he
saw it for the harsh land it was its
all right with me he thought but i
didnt have any right to ask mina to
face it

  the team had stopped old belle was
puffing and snorting asa did not urge
them on he knew it was time to
breathe them again throwing an arm
over the mare he huddled against her
trying to draw what warmth he could
from the animal

  surely tappers saloon could not be
much farther the crucifying thought
that he might have missed the ford
came to him but he knew better than
that all along here the south fork
bottoms were choked with willow and
scrub it would turn him back until
he finally found the ford

  there was no sound from the wagon
surely the lord was looking out for
mina tonight he bowed his head hum-
bly thinking how helpless a man could
be at times

  with an effort he roused himself
and shouted at the team the horses
refused even to raise their drooping
heads making his way around in front
of them he caught them by the curb-
chains and tried to break them out
he met with their uncompromising
fore-legged resistance

  it puzzled asa remembering his ex-
perience at the dry wash he turned
his back on the team and began to in-
vestigate he had gone only a few feet
when something loomed darkly before
him another step and he knew what
it was to make sure he moved off to
his right a yard or two there blink-
ing at him through the snow was a
buttery daub of light this wooden
wall was the rear end of soapy tap-
pers horse shed trying to run he
made his way back to the team

  mina were here he told her
were at the ford-

  she caught his excitement and the
faint note of pride in his blurred voice
he had a right to be proud she
thought for he had accomplished what
few men could have done even though
those bright blades of pain were slash-
ing at her again she smiled at him

  ill have you inside in just a min-
ute he promised

 she watched him as he struggled
with the horses and finally got them
into the shed the animals seemed
barely able to drag one leg after the
other asa was no better off panic
seized her momentarily as she realized
their situation she sat up in the wag-
on hardly aware that they were out of
the wind and snow

  asa- she cried asa we cant go
on look at you you are half dead
with cold

  ill be all right as soon as i get
thawed out he assured her dont


all western

worry about me

  and the team-theres no going on
with them she insisted you know
it

  theyre in pretty bad shape it was
a grudging admission theres horses
here but theyre just cow ponies
theyd never go to harness he shook
his head hopelessly ive been putting
this moment off for a long time i-i
dont know what were going to do

 you could borrow a pony-when
you are warm asa the suggestion
was born of desperation but her tone
was steady as she voiced it he stared
at her amazed as comprehension came
to him

  and leave you here you mean

  yes if you could bring the doc-
tor-

  no mina no he cried you dont
know what youre saying our baby
born in a saloon

  what difference can it make what
can it matter the fortitude of her
pioneer forbears was speaking now
after all this is still a wild land-

  damn this land he muttered i
hate it

  no you love it asa and so do i
she said some day it will be a fine
rich land and some of it will belong
to us our baby will be proud of it
you ask soapy tapper if you can bring
me in

  asa colcord thought he knew this
woman who bore his name but as he
stumbled up to soapys door he told
himself he would never know her

  his hands were too cold to turn the
knob but it was flung open in answer
to his banging a white ghostly figure
he stumbled into the barroom and
stood there swaying dizzily the heat
of this room making his senses reel

 with fogged eyes he saw soapy

obese heavy-featured standing be-
hind his bar two men had a foot on
the bar rail asa knew yiem stuffy
andrews who rode for the big 
square outfit and young grat spane
a rough tough puncher with an un-
ruly shock of red hair in the year that
had passed since he drifted into this
country grat had had many jobs and
stuck to none if he had caught on
somewhere for the wihter asa could
not name the spread

  a third man had opened the door it
was old watery-eyed bitter creek cas-
sidy he owned a little range on the
headwaters of the south fork

  these men evidently trapped here
by the storm had settled down to
make the best of it now their conver-
sation abruptly arrested they froze in
grotesque attitudes and stared at him
with unbelieving eyes soapy was no
less confounded his hooded gaze sud-
denly wide and incredulous he leaned
forward his bulbous stomach draped
over the bar and sucked in his breath
noisily

  why its asa colcord-or whats
left of him he cried man yore
about done for here- he grabbed a
glass and a bottle of rye-git a shot
of this into yuh in a hurry yuh need
a drink if ever a gent did where yuh
from anyhow

  ute creek asa mumbled

  stuffy andrews got a chair from the
card table and tried to slide it under
him as he saw him sway asa steadied
himself against it but he did not sit
down

  all the way from ute creek on a
night like this soapy demanded
you must be mad

 my wife-shes going to have a
baby said asa im taking her to the
doctor she-shes outside in the wag-
raw land



on id like to bring her in if i can
she-she hasnt long to go i hardly
know what to do my team is all stove
in if i coidd leave my wife here and
borrow a horse i-i could bring doc
mighels back with me-

  a baby soapy gulped a baby-
his loosely-hinged mouth fell open
and something akin to terror froze on
his crude face the others were equal-
ly aghast

 you mean the baby will be born
here stuffy andrews gasped

  grat spane flashed a glance at the
door as though considering bolting the
place at once old bitter creek was
nervously shifting from one foot to the
other reading the look in their eyes
asa realized the enormity of what he
was asking

  ill be damned soapy groaned as
men went he didnt amount to much
there had been talk about him and
always to his discredit rumor once
having it that keeping this saloon was
only a cover for his real business asa
thought of these things now and knew
he should have considered them be-
fore speaking and yet there was
soapy suddenly glaring fiercely at the
others and saying well why not
why cant miz colcord have her baby
here will yuh tell me what yore
waitin for yuh bring her in here at
once and yuh be mighty gentle with
her well he roared as they hung
back for a moment

  that angry bellow had the desired
effect the men shuffled out and soapy
came around from the end of the bar
he poured some whisky into the empty
glass and made asa down it

  yuh git them frozen things off he
commanded and stay away from the
stove till yuh thaw out ill shake up
my bed a little shame to ask a woman

to use it-aint got no sheets or
nuthin-but its the best there is
here

 asa tried to murmur his thanks
soapy growled him to silence aint
nuthin to be thankin me for he said
well stretch a rope across the room
and hang up a couple of blankets so
yore wife will have the back of the
saloon to herself

 the men brought mina in bitter
creek helped soapy string up the
blankets from where he sat asa
stared at them dully he wanted to
help he wanted to go to mina but
there was a lethargy on him that kept
pushing him deeper and deeper into
his chair

  his frost-bitten face was beginning
to burn he knew that rubbing a little
snow into it every few minutes would
help even that was beyond him

 stuffy andrews went out again
when he returned he said i put up
your team

  it roused asa what was he thinking
of sitting here like this he had to go
on to town he had to borrow a pony
slowly he dragged himself to his feet

  he said ill have to ask one of you
to loan me a horse ive got to be go-
ing

 something touched grat spanes
blank inscrutable face briefly and was
gone he said my broncs in the shed
but youre all in you better stay here
with miz colcord ill go fetch doc
mighels

 asa was surprised and touched-
having faced the storm for five hours
he could appreciate w hat grat was of-
fering-but he could not rub out of
his eyes his reluctance to put the fate
of mina and the baby in spanes hands
by every tale he had heard of him he
was shiftless and unreliable looking


all western

for a man you could trust in an emer-
gency you would not have picked grat
spane

  grat pretended not to notice but he
read that reservation in asas mind

  the kids right soapy spoke up
he had finished hanging the blankets
hes young and tough as bullhide
yuhd never make it yoreself col-
cord he turned to stuffy yuh let
grat take yore hair chaps theyll keep
his legs warm

 grat-you know how much depends
on this said asa you wont fail
me

  ill fetch him as i said grat an-
swered quietly

  soapy poured him out a drink before
he left git this inside yuh and be on
yore way he ordered grat dashed off
the liquor and hurried out soapy put
the bottle on the back bar signifying
that his establishment was closed for
the night

  old bitter creek insisted that snow
water was better than snow itself for
drawing the sting out of frost bite he
worked over asa until the pain was
gone

  yore shore lookin better soapy
observed

  yes im coming around all right
asa agreed

  he went back to sit beside mina
she reached out and caught his
hand

  asa these men have been very kind
to us she murmured softly we must
never forget

  he squeezed her fingers affection-
ately and said nothing a few minutes
later she had another bad spell they
were coming oftener now he knew
they would he prayed that grat
would be back with the doctor in
time

  at the front of the barroom soapy
bitter creek and stuffy andrews sat
at the card table a strange silence on
them had there been any place they
could go stuffy and bitter creek
would have gone but they were pris-
oners too at soapys suggestion they
tried playing cards it soon palled on
them soapy got up and turned the
lamps low

 never thought about the light
gittin in her eyes he explained

  bitter creek built up the fire mov-
ing back and forth on tiptoe so as not
to make any noise and being rewarded
by a smothered curse from stuffy
when he closed the stove door with a
faint bang

  soapy wound his watch at midnight
grat had been gone barely an hour

  be some time before he gets back
stuffy murmured guardedly he lis-
tened to the booming of the wind
this country is sure gettin a house-
cleanin tonight

  mina was in great pain again they
winced every time she groaned un-
consciously they were trying to bear
her agony somehow her suffering
seemed to rub some of the hardness
out of their faces

  life and death- soapy murmured
soberly he shook his head makes a
man think

  the others nodded and said nothing
but they were humbled too and far
out on the flat lands grat spane rode
with head lowered against the storm
and roundly damned himself for hav-
ing been so ready with his offer

  many times he pulled his stumbling
pony out of the drifts the blizzard
was really beginning to howl at first
he had been contemptuous of its sting
for already a man of parts he knew
what it was to come to grips with the
raw land



northers on the llano and the knifing
cold of the poganip on nevadas high
deserts he had been taking this storm
seriously enough for the past hour he
knew a man didnt want to make a
mistake tonight it made him a little
more careful not to miss the heavy
stand of aspens at iron point

  there out of the wind he managed
to build three fires he got in between
them turning round and round until
he was warmed through he still had
the long swing around ruby mountain
ahead of him it wouldnt be easy but
he knew hed make town now

  it was long after midnight when he
stalked into the hotel barroom where
doc mighels sat playing poker doc
listened to him and then took another
look at his cards

  ill play this hand then well go
said doc you get yourself a drink
and order me one

  fifteen miles to dutchmans ford
and a howling blizzard tearing at you
all the way one of the players com-
miserated him wimmen might have
more consideration

  doc won the pot and heaved himself
to his feet-he was a big man-and
said quietly reproving charley mir-
acles dont wait on you or me or the
weather

  downing his drink he led the way
to his office and got his worn black bag
and the few things he knew he would
need there was nothing prepossessing
about doc mighels in his ill-fitting
clothes the front of him invariably
spattered with cigar ashes undoubted-
ly he drank too much judged by city
standards he wasnt even much of a
doctor his ways unorthodox and often
harsh but whatever he was he gave
of himself without stint and when he
walked into a sick room it often seem-

ed that some heavenly healer entered
with him for just his presence seemed
to imbue the ill and dying with hope
and courage and his dowdy clothes
and the shabby black bag with the
hole worn through one end from years
of rubbing against his saddle skirt
were forgotten

  it was that way with mina colcord
he reached her in time and it was in
soapy tappers barroom her son was
born

  asa knew what he owed these men
he also knew how things were with
grat spane he called grat aside i
can malye a job for you grat he said
the boy shook his head and thanked
him

  a job is what youre needin asa
told him they gazed at each other for
a second and grat knew that asa had
his secret

  it wouldnt do any good he mut-
tered i wouldnt stick

  in the morning mina let them see
the child grats hard young face sud-
denly corded into a bleak mask with-
out a word he turned and headed out
to his pony never glancing back he
rode away

  soapy insisted on holding the baby
mina gazed at him and saw through
all his worthlessness and found some-
thing good

  yore sure somethin to be proud
of young feller soapy declared ad-
miringly - was sorta hopin youd
be a girl mina saw his chin quiver
and knew that memory was reaching
back across the years to something that
was clean and good then suddenly as
though frightened at what he beheld
soapy laughed nervously shucks
he exclaimed men is what this coun-
try needs like as not theyll be sendin
yuh off to congress or sunthin


all western

  there was the usual amount of rus-
tling that spring mina occupied with
the boy was only remotely aware of
it until in the dusk of one evening
early in may fred isbell of the 
square rode into the yard as they sat
at supper he spoke to her through the
window and asked asa to step outside
raising his voice against the barking
of the new pup which they had recent-
ly acquired

  something in fred isbells flat ex-
pressionless face told her that he did
not come on pleasant business asa
joined him bidding the dog be quiet
they spoke for a few moments mina
caught asas shocked no you dont
say 

  we cant be mistaken isbell an-
swered we mean to put an end to it
this time they talked on for a while
leaving isbell said loud enough for
her to hear you be at my place before
daybreak colcord asa nodded and
the man rode away

  although he had not finished his cof-
fee asa went down to the corral be-
yond the barn instead of returning to
the house he stayed there a long time
his foot on the corral gate he might
have been watching tihe new colt that
had been foaled this morning mina
thought differently and when he came
back to the house she had to put a
question to him to elicit any informa-
tion

  rustling again he told her isbell
says everybody is organized this time
im to be at his place before sunup
she saw his mouth tighten i wish i
didnt have to go and then without
meeting her gaze he added lamely
theres so much to do right now

  he did not deceive mina she busied
herself with the dishes not wanting
to embarrass him i know how busy

you are she said believing she knew
what was troubling him it was not
easy for her to hold her voice steady
but rustling has to be put down this
seems to be the only way to do it

  the matter ended there and they
were careful not to refer to it again it
placed a restraint on them that made
the evening long

  asa finally knocked the ashes from
his pipe and went to bed at two in
the morning she heard him out in the
kitchen making himself a cup of cof-
fee later he let himself out of the
house and in a few minutes she
heard him riding away it was the first
time he had ever left without kissing
her good-by plainer than words it told
her what impended

  the morning dragged along out in
the yard ring the dog barked and
growled by turns at the end of his
chain half a dozen times mina came
to the door and bade him be quiet at
noon fred isbell and four others
stuffy andrews among them rode up
to the house isbells manner was grim
and uncompromising but he found
something in minas eyes that made
him reframe the question he had come
to ask

  mrs colcord he said markedly
uneasy you havent seen anything of
grat spane over this way today have
you

 though mina heard him without
surprise she felt her blood go cold
fred isbell had told her only what she
had already surmised no she said
i havent seen anyone

  the man nodded but was not con-
vinced mina could feel him weighing
her answer he said he cant be far
hes wounded some his trail was as
plain as day to mud springs when we
lost it he was headin for ute creek
raw land



  hes very likely gone down the can-
yon said mina a slow fury beginning
to burn in her i couldnt imagine
him coming this way

 fred isbell did not say what had
given him the idea but mina knew
what was in his mind and it did not
need the cooing of her baby awake in
his crib to tell her their eyes met and
something ran between them that
made isbell flush darkly under his tan

  you are free to search the house
and barn she said

  no he protested hurriedly sorry
we bothered you mrs colcord well
whip out the canyon we made sure
old bitter creek wont do any more
rustling and were going to be just as
sure about spane he started to turn
his horse if your husband and the
others come looking for us tell them
where we are

  where is my husband mina asked
macglashin your husband and
quite a bunch pulled away from us to
round up soapy tapper he informed
her it shouldnt take them long he
raised his hand to his companions and
they rode away at a driving gallop

  still burning with indignation mina
watched until they were only puffs of
dust in the distance suddenly they
were gone altogether she felt as they
did about rustling but it did not keep
her from hoping that grat spane
would win free thought of him so
young and his life forfeited to his fool-
ishness filled her with nausea he had
served her well and not counted the
cost to himself soapy had been kind
to her too but she had an entirely dif-
ferent feeling about him she pitied
soapy and bitter creek though she
realized that the pattern of their lives
had made the end that had overtaken
them well nigh inevitable once there

might have been some excuse for
them some hope that they would
change their ways that time had long
since passed

  she couldnt believe it was quite that
way with grat spane-at least not yet
she knew the good and the bad in a
man were often sadly scrambled that
sometimes it needed only a push in
the right direction to enable him to
find himself feeling as she did she
wondered what she would have done
had it been in her power to help grat
get away

  i dont know she murmured so-
berly i perhaps would have done the
wrong thing

 weary of the dogs barking she
freed it and straightaway it raced to
the barn door and raised its voice
louder than ever ring you come here
at once she called whatever has
got in-

  she stopped abruptly struck by the
fact that the barn door was closedfor
days indeed ever since the weather
had turned mild it had stood open
the closed door the frantic dog-un-
derstanding came to her quickly her
cheeks tightly drawn she walked to
the barn with long clean strides she
had to put her shoulder to the door to
force it back

  quite simply she said grat if you
are hiding up there in the hay come
down at once

  in the silence that followed she was
aware of the pounding of her heart
she knew he was here and that she
had already decided what she was go-
ing to do with him a moment later a
rustling in the hay rewarded her a
board creaked above and then a pair
of overall-clad legs appeared on the
ladder when grat finally stood before
her she saw that all the swagger and


all western

bluster had gone from him he had
found some old rags in the barn and
managed to bandage his wounded arm

  with one foot clawing the other and
looking the picture of dejection he
said i dont care what you do with
me miz colcord you can turn me over
to the posse if you want to i jest want
you to know i didnt come here cause
i figgered you owed me anythin

  mina felt her throat tighten im
sure of that grat

  my bronc folded up on me he ex-
plained i knew i couldnt make the
canyon-so i came here i-i never
thought how it might look he tugged
at his hat nervously and looked away
his eyes bleak and bitter with self-re-
proach i know i dont amount to
anythin but there is some things i
draw the line at he muttered with a
trace of pride

  if i were you i wouldnt be so
quick to admit to myself that i didnt
amount to anything mina reproved
him that may be what is at the bot-
tom of your trouble you get yourself
up to the house now and be quick
about it

 never having dressed a gunshot
wound it took her twice as long as it
should have the only antiseptic she
had was a bottle of creosote dip that
asa used on the stock it had tongues
of fire that made grat spane grit his
teeth

  your arm will be all right she told
him pausing at the window to scan
the flats she knew that asa and myles
macglashin and the others riding with
them must be coming soon it warned
her that she had no time to lose a
horse wearing a cross t brand drifted
in here this spring she told him no
one ever came to claim it ill saddle
it for you and you can go

  grat swallowed hard miz colcord
you shouldnt be doin all this for me
he protested huskily mina turned on
him very sharply

  maybe you are right she said flat-
ly maybe it is a waste of time to try
to help you if you are determined to
be hanged for a rustler it doesnt
make much difference whether you are
hanged here or over in wild river
and thats what it will get to grat
unless you change your ways just get-
ting to a new country wont help you
you know

  yesm he muttered as miserable
as though he were actually about to be
jerked to eternity

  i know you got off to a bad start
mina continued so have a good many
others those who changed their ways
are here today respected her eyes
were level and unafraid as she gazed
at him you can amount to something
if youll only have half as much faith
in yourself as i have in you

  opening the door she told him to
wait there until she returned

  it was only a matter of minutes be-
fore she was back with the saddled
horse about to ride away he looked
down at her and mina saw something
in his eyes that said she had not made
a mistake

  dont you worry about me miz
colcord he advised haltingly no
reason why you should believe me but
im goin to try to amount to some-
thin

  mina smiled at him i believe you
grat she murmured her eyes begin-
ning to mist

  late that afternoon riding home
alone across the flatlands asa encoun-
tered doc mighels doc had seen the
smoking ruins of soapy tappers sa-
raw land



loon at dutchmans ford and knew
what had happened to soapy himself

  its a sad days work said doc i
hear that only grat spane got away
yes asa nodded soberly i dont
know how to tell my wife doc the
two of us always felt indebted to those
men im afraid she wont understand
i think she will doc said confi-

dently our womenfolks have a sur-
prising way of mixing sense with sen-
timent this is a wild lawless country
but they dont have any trouble no
matter where they go they are safe
and respected if thats the way they
want it maybe its because they under-
stand so well

 oh ride the dry river

                      by s omar barker

           oh ride the dry river and ride the gray hill

          where the dry western wind that can never be still
          has withered and scorched to the roots every blade
          of grass in the sun and of grass in the shade

           ride where the poor cattle that havent yet died
           drift hungry and bony and starvation-eyed
           in vain hopeless search upon tottery feet

           for a swallow of water a thin bite to eat

          oh ride where you will when the withering hand
          of drouth dries the rivers and parches the land

          and up from your heart feel the bitterness rise
          of a man beaten down by a whip from the skies-
          a sun-man no longer a friend of the sun

          with death all around you and naught to be done

          old cowmen tormented by dried water holes

          know how the long dry spells can wither mens souls

           yet ride the dry river and ride the scorched hill

          with a hope in their hearts even drouth cannot kill

          oh ride the brown mesas and ride the parched plain-
          and some day come riding back home with a rain

chapter one
the quitter

happed and spurred aaron rose
rode his gray saddler at a pleas-
ing singlefoot into campbells flat the
county seat before the hardware store
he swung easily to the ground tied his
horse and nodding right and left at
acquaintances entered the stairway
that led to the offices above the store

  he opened the first door on the right
on which was painted

marcus t lloyd
attorney and counsellor-at-law

  aaron rose disappears and plays
  an unexpected role as rangeland
  magician for the benefit of a come-
  ly and charming tenderfoot

  lloyds stenographer looked up from
her battered desk and smiled at the
caller

 good morning mr rose she
greeted him

 aaron rose smiled gravely and
lifted his hat pretty mornin isnt

  no he wont be going for a quarter
  of an hour did you wish to see him

    i guess hes seldom too busy to see
  you mr rose-and with a smile she
  rose and went through a door marked
  private

   have him come on in rose heard
 the attorney tell the girl

    without waiting for further invita-
  tion the rancher stepped through the
  door

   mornin aaron was attorney
 lloyds greeting pretty mild for this
 time o year have a seat

    the girl went out softly closing the
  door behind her

   well aaron said the thin-nosed
 lawyer i guess we got em goin eh
 aarons well-cut lips contracted to a
 straight line but his perpetually good-
 humored face was creased by a smile
 that offset the sternness of the lips

    got em goin nothin he contra-
  dicted rather mildly i came in mark
  to tell you to drop the case

   what whats that

and ask for a dismissal pay the costs

   why aaron were just beginning

 ture have suffered in your eyes your

 down to the courthouse mark and call
 her off

   aaron i didnt know you were a

quitter reproached lloyd

  neither did i grinned the rancher
but you got my instructions mark
im posi-te-ly through thats me
without more ado he passed into the
outer office smiled good-by at the busy
stenographer and clanked into the
dusty hall down in the street he
walked along for a block and entered
the corner saloon

  several men leaned over the bar
others hovered over a warm stove at
the rear end of the room for the april
mornings were still crisp in this foot-
hill country the men at the bar looked
up quickly as the swinging doors flew
open

  the coldest bottle o beer you got
jennings said rose this is my
thirsty mornin

  hows yer suit cornin on rose

the white froth climbing up its neck

all western

aaron remarked a man i was tellin
my wife last night ye was a fool for
throwin good money away they got
moren you have aaron

  over by the stove a large man sud-
denly rose from his chair and lurched
toward the group at the bar a glance
was enough to show that he was under
the influence of liquor though it was
only ten oclock in the morning

  aaron roses lips tightened as in
the clear lower portion of the back-bar
mirror he saw and recognized him

  he was a man as large as the rancher
himself he possessed a great pyra-
midal head topped off by a shock of
heavy black hair he wore a canvas
coat corduroy trousers and heavy
tramping-boots this man was cyrus
hurley the ranchers enemy for the
past two years hurley was the local
zanjero for the water company that
rose was suing

  a zanjero it may be necessary to ex-
plain is a man who has charge of the
distribution of water among the vari-
ous ranches that are supplied by an
irrigation system before he had
bought his ranch aaron rose had
served as zanjero in this water district
hurley had been his chief assistant
they had quarreled over hurleys per-
petual drinking which rendered him
unfit for his work also rose had sus-
pected him of giving certain ranchers
more water than they paid the com-
pany for thereby pocketing small tips
for himself rose had not discharged
him because of his family but let him
off repeatedly with warnings then
rose having saved his money had
bought the rose ranch titled by him-
self because of his name and the count-
less roses that he grew wherever they
could thrive best and to the surprise
of the neighborhood cyrus hurley

had been appointed zanjero in his
stead and cyrus in a spiteful spirit
had done a great deal of injury to
aaron rose since the days when they
both had been working together

  when he reached the bar he sidled
up to the rancher and leered at him
wickedly

  ill tell the world he said rather
thickly that ye was a fool rose we
had ye beat from the start you poor
fish ye dont know that it was me that
kep ye from gettin yer permnt in-
junction do ye ye dont savvy that it
was me that worked on the chief engi-
neer and made him believe it was best
to run that canal across your poor
piece o land instead of cummingss
do ye anddye savvy why i done it
to get even with ye fr many a dirty
little deal ye handed me when ye was
zanjero thats what i done ye poor
fish

  rose laughed shortly after a moment
or two of silence good imagination
you got cy he said winking at the
bartender dont try that stuff on me

  but aaron rose was not as sure as
before that his destination would be
new york

chapter two
aaron gets an idea

hat evening aaron
 rose sat in his ranch
 house brooding over
 the events of the day
 the early california
 evening was cool
 and brisk he looked
 through the window
 at his beautiful acres and sighed
 deeply

pasture lands were turning green be-
fore him and the smell of early flowers
enchanted ranch



floated in through the open window
here and there over these pasture
lands were groves of gigantic oaks
and beyond was a forest of spruce and
sugar pines there were patches of
chaparral that rose had refused to
eliminate because of their wonderful
color under the changing light of the
sun red cattle nibbled at the young
grass there were sheep of a fine
breed herded into a corral for the
night his horses rubbed their noses
against rail fences or bit playfully at
one another it made a scene that
aaron rose loved but in his mind it
was marred by the irrigating canal
that crossed it from end to end

  deeply he brooded over his difficul-
ties he had been brooding over them
entirely too much of late obstinately
he had refused to use one pint of the
water that flowed gurglingly through
his picturesque ranch matters were
not so bad as he allowed himself to
imagine the rose ranch a dry ranch
until the lateral had been constructed
might have been under irrigation now
but for the stubbornness of its owner
his land had doubled nay trebled in
value since the water crossed it but
he could not see it thus aaron rose
was pretty much of a dreamer and in
reality cared little for this worlds
goods he wanted peace and plenty and
the joys of the big outdoors-little
more he loved his stock and his work
more than the returns they brought
him hence his bitterness toward the
big water company who cared not for
scenery but dividends which they did
not need

  and so his old enemy cyrus hurley
and this big companys engineer were
at the bottom of his defeat and the
court had been with them for aarons
lawyer had at the preliminary hear-

ing pointed out that the ditch might
just as well cross cummingss prop-
erty as the rose ranch on this show-
ing they had got their temporary in-
junction pending final action by the
court but in the meantime the dirty
work had been done and at the second
hearing a permanent injunction had
been denied

  well hed fix them yet he was not
without ideas that morning he really
had had it in mind to stop the useless
controversy for he had reached the
conclusion that the jury had been
fixed he really had intended to go
to new york for a short time to forget
the entire matter now however he
had no intention of going to new
york but he was glad that he had
spread the news of his intended trip
he was glad too that he had spoken
of the big supply of provisions he
meant to lay in for oswald jacks to
use during his absence no he would
not go to new york but he would go
somewhere and the supply of provi-
sions that he would buy would startle
the groceryman

  he left his chair and went to the
wall telephone he called up jacks and
told him to report for duty in the
morning then he went to bed feeling
better than before

  cyrus hurley had given him a great
idea he would make them pay dam-
ages for the great trees that had
groaned to the ground on the rose
ranch theyd pay dearly too no man
could beat aaron rose out of his rights
and get away with it

  but manlike aaron rose had fig-
ured without the girl someone has
facetiously said that it is a noble thing
for a man todevote his life to man-
kind but that it is nobler still and far
more interesting for him to devote it


all western

to womankind aaron rose had no girl
to work for-no girl to show him his
foolish stubbornness but a little boy
who wears no clothes and carries a
quiver filled with arrows and a bow
was at that very moment chuckling
against his sleeveless wrist at aaron
rose

          chapter three
          grapevine creek

ving thus decided
that what ailed aaron
rose was too much
aaron rose cupid
had looked about for
the girl and found her
he found her rid-
ing down grapevine
creek some twelve miles from the
rose ranch in a big wagon squeezed
in between two men she was a pretty
girl and her hair was dark and wavy
and there came a dimple in each cheek
every time she even thought there
might be occasion for a smile

  the road down grapevine creek was
so old that no one in that country
could have told if asked when it had
been built the district through which
the wagon groaned its weary way was
an abandoned district and for years
and years the road had not heard the
ring of pick or the scrape of a shovel
grapevine creek itself had tended to
the road in a thousand places it had
washed over it and uncovered boulders
that had once been hidden by the hand
of man or piled up snarls of driftwood
also its moistness had festooned grape-
vines overhead like the tangled hair of
a mad woman over the drifts and
boulders the wagon rocked up and
down the four-horse team plowing its
way through the grapevine entangle-

ments the riders bending forward
and plucking at the vines tearing them
away from their throats expecting ev-
ery moment to be hung by the neck
until they were dead dead dead be-
hind them a large load of household
goods swayed from side to side and
any moment the riders expected the
entire mass to pitch off into the creek
or against the bank on the opposite
side the pretty girl rode between the
driver and her brother lest she be like-
wise lifted from her perch and hurled
into oblivion

  her name was diantha stanley her
brothers name was duncan stanley
the name of the driver does not mat-
ter since he was hired only for that
one trip and was nursing a terrible
grouch because he had not had the 
sense to refuse when diantha looked
at him so reproachfully with her big
black eyes he knew the road down
grapevine creek of old for years no
teamster had attempted it yet here he
was praying only that his reach
would hold out to the end of the silly
trip

  about a mile beyond the point where
the travelers were struggling onward
there lay a tiny valley in the cup of
the hills here grapevine creek swung
in toward the steep hills on the right
of it so that it did not break the tiny
level spot and divide it in half here
stood an old tumbledown cabin and
this cabin was the goal of the three
who fought their way down the creek
bed road

  now if one were to walk from the
shaky and ancient cabin pass over the
little flat so green and tempting to an
inexperienced agriculturalist cross
grapevine creek and climb through
alders bays and oaks a way he would
come upon a dense patch of chaparral
enchanted ranch



this great patch extended for miles
almost to the outskirts of campbells
flat the county seat it was what is
known in the west as locked chap-
arral its branches were so intertwined
that nothing larger than a bird could
pass through the thicket but by crawl-
ing on hands and knees and occasion-
ally lower still one could pass through
it provided he needed neither food
nor water for perhaps a month

  but if on this particular day one
were to have made the attempt telling
himself that he would just crawl a
short distance to see how it felt he
might have crawled unexpectedly up-
on a man seated on the ground in one
of the occasional open spots training
a long telescope upon a distant ridge
beyond the rushing falcon river and
if the crawler were acquainted with
mr aaron rose owner of the magnifi-
cent rose ranch he might have won-
dered what mr rose was doing there
provided he had not lost his reason
altogether

  but here he sat and did not know
that there was another human being
within twelve miles of him and be-
hind him was a cave-a long tunnel-
like cave forty feet in length by about
seven in diameter and in the cave was
a store of provisions that would have
convinced the crawler that mr rose
meant to stay for an indefinite length
of time also there were canvas bags
filled with water from grapevine
creek all the comforts of a home for
there was firewood in plenty all about
-the remnants of fallen trees that had
gone down in a great forest fire that
swept the land before the chaparral
grew there

  so here placidly sat aaron rose and
it must be admitted that his perch on
the steep hillside surrounded by a vast

and uncompromising sea of chaparral
was a far cry from the bright lights of
new york city

  and as he gazed through his tele-
scope at the distant mountains he
heard the agonized rumble of a wagon
coming down the creek below him

  great guns whats that he mut-
tered a wagon a wagon hasnt
come down that canyon in twenty
years

chapter four
to new york one way

bout a week had
elapsed since aaron
rose had telephoned
oz jacks to come
next day and take
charge of the ranch
the new foreman had
appeared on schedule
and shortly after his arrival aaron
had driven his  team of immense
clydesdales to campbells flats where
he purchased what was perhaps the
largest single order of groceries that
the emporium had ever sold

  it was late in the evening when the
purchaser started back with his load
it was eight miles from the town to
the rose ranch approximately five
miles from home aaron turned off on
a cross-road despite the protests of
the squat bays and traveled for an
hour into an uninhabited country

  reaching a particularly secluded
spot that he had in mind he stopped
the clydes and began unloading gro-
ceries

  he took off a goodly portion of the
load and a piece at a time carried it
into the woods and hid it in a remote
little ravine also he hid a large bundle
that had been in the wagon when he


all western

left the ranch then he drove hurried-
ly home and deposited what was left
to the credit of oswald jacks

  next morning dressed in his best
and with his suitcase at his feet he
was driven to campbells flat by the
new foreman at the county seat he
strolled about gossiping with old ac-
quaintances and took pains to let it
be known that he was going to new
york

  then he sauntered toward the depot
where the agent tried to sell him a
round-trip ticket but he took a one-
way instead arguing that he might not
wish to return to california by the
time that the return date had arrived

  when the long overland train pulled
in with one huge locomotive ahead
and another pushing he waved his
hand right and left and boarded his
sleeper it was nearly night an hour
after the train had started climbing
the mountain he slipped out at a wa-
tering-station grip in hand the offi-
cials of that train saw him no more

  he knew that there was a little town
quite close there was little about that
country that he did not know how-
ever the overland was wont to pass it
as if it were a jungle camp of tramps
rose walked to this town where he
felt sure that no one lived who knew
him awoke a sleepy garage man and
ordered a car for a ranch in the neigh-
borhood of campbells flat

  they were away shortly and long
before midnight the passenger ordered
the driver to stop telling him that the
ranch was up a certain cross-road that
they had reached and that it was too
rough for machine travel by night
the distance was short he said and he
did not mind walking

 he paid the driver watched him
turn his car and start back then grip-

ped his suitcase and hurried along the
road over which he had driven the
bays the day before

  he reached his cache in the ravine
and found everything as he had left it
he undid a parcel and shifted into the
rugged clothes that he was wont to
wear at home instantly he felt much
better his good clothes he placed in
the empty suitcase which he had let
no one handle but himself

 next he walked cross-country
through the woods and came to a little
ranch every detail of which he knew
here stealing up to a corral he bor-
rowed four burros which the owner
used on occasional prospecting trips
up the falcon river he knew where
to find the pack saddles and ropes in
the stable and in a little while hevas
hurrying the small burden bearers
back to his cache

  in the early hours of the morning
he deposited the last of his hidden sup-
plies on the banks of grapevine creek
close to the ramshackle old cabin on
the abandoned john wharton place

  just before dawn he returned the
burros and hastened away for it was
about time for his neighbor to be up
and doing

  it required all of the entire day that
followed for him to crawl with his
necessities of life under the chaparral
to the hidden cave he could carry or
drag only one piece at a time and it
was a herculeantask but aaron rose
was a herculean man

  at last everything including the
telescope was in the old tunnel he
had gone back to the creek as darkness
fell and carried up water in his canvas
bags then sore and weary he had
collected fuel and built a small camp-
fire over which he squatted and cook-
ed his evening meal
enchanted ranch



  the tunnel needs a bit of explana-
tion for it was known perhaps to no
one in that country but aaron rose
at least aaron thought that this was
true

  over seventy years before in the
days of the forty-niners a long ditch

had been run from the headwaters of

                                      

grapevine creek to a gold mine miles
down the valley high up above the
falcon river the mine had long since
been forgotten as were the men who
had operated it in that day no doubt
the ditch had extended through heavy
forests through the forests cattle had
wandered in later years and trampled
down the old ditch until scarcely a
vestige of it remained then the great
fire had swept the country and chap-
arral had grown up where the forest
had stood so the ditch was forgotten
the greater part of it hidden away in
the dense chaparral

  but in following the contours of the
hills the diggers of the ditch had oc-
casionally found it necessary to tun-
nel and the cave that aaron had
chosen as his secret rendezvous was
one of these tunnels through the
rocky brow of a hill for years both
ends had been closed by the shattering
dirt and eroding rock

  in trailing a wounded mountain lion
into the chaparral one day the loose
dirt had given way under aarons feet
and the secret tunnel was exposed

  at the time aaron had thought what
a wonderful hiding-place this unknown
tunnel still closed at one end would
make for a man who wished to hide
from his fellows but then it had not
occurred to him that he ever would
want it for that purpose

  now that he did want it however
he found that a little work was all that
was -required to clear the mouth en-

tirely and this he did the first morning
after he had dragged his goods to the
tunnels mouth

  and now everything was in readi-
ness for his lengthy stay here in the
chaparral while his acquaintances be-
lieved that he was in new york city
he had a few books and magazines
he would not be very lonely and in
two wreeks a man would follow the
ridge that he had looked at through
his telescope a man who would drive
a laden burro ahead of him for the
passing of this man he was waiting

  then there appeared upon the scene
a dark-haired man and a girl with
black- hair and dimples and they
moved bag and baggage into the old
john wharton cabin he was not going
to be so lonely after all it seemed
the possibilities looked promising

chapter five
knock em dead

aron had little fear
that the new arrivals
down below would
discover his secret
hiding-place for they
would be too busy re-
pairing the old cabin
and establishing them-
selves therein to make any exploring
trips of the hills about them even if
they felt so inclined there was not one
chance in a thousand of their crawling
under the locked tops of the chaparral
merely for pleasure one did not ordi-
narily stroll about for diversion or in
a spirit of exploration on his hands
and knees

  it was about noon when they ar-
rived they unloaded their belongings
before the cabin and paid the teamster
he immediately swung his team about


all western

and departed without one backward
glance

  in days that followed aaron saw the
two at work on the cabin cleaning
out the old spring to get clear domestic
water and attending to numerous
other tasks of settlement he noted
that the girl did most of the work and
at this he frowned often he heard her
singing and her clear contralto notes
drifted up the hillside in pleasing melo-
dies aaron liked to hear a woman
sing

  she was indeed a busy little body
always doing something with sleeves
rolled above her elbows and doing it
with a snap and preciseness that ap-
pealed to him every time he saw her
carrying two buckets of water from
the spring he ground his teeth what
on earth did her husband mean by al-
lowing her to do that heavy work he
was in the cabin most of the time
while the girl was almost continually
at tasks outside he was a good-for-
nothing loafer rose decided and
longed to give him a piece of his mind

  and what on earth were they doing
there anyway were they just camp-
ing out no everything pointed to the
belief that they had come to stay were
they crazy did they expect to make a
living on those rocky forty acres with
the creek bed dry as a bone by the
middle of june

 about ten days had passed after
their coming when early one morn-
ing aaron saw the two walk hand in
hand up the canyon they were away
so long that he decided to go down
and investigate but shrank from such
a thing instinctively

  they returned shortly before dusk
proudly driving an old bay horse that
aaron instantly recognized it be-
longed or had belonged provided it

had now changed hands to a rancher
who lived at the upper end of grape-
vine creek it was twenty-three years
old if it was a day-an old mare that
had at one time been a three-minute
trotter if they had paid over ten dol-
lars for the mare they had been
stung behind the still proud old ani-
mal bumped a dilapidated buggy and
from the buggy when the outfit halted
before the cabin the owners took sun-
dry articles among them a small plow
heavy harness and one section of a
harrow

  great guns theyre going to try
to farm aaron groaned

  the unhitching of the mare took fif-
teen minutes both at work she grew
impatient and nipped at the girl in
retaliation the girl shook a reproving
finger in her face and fondled her
neck they unbuckled every buckle in
sight aaron thought and it would
take a harness maker to put the har-
ness together again

  but at last the old crowbait was free
of leather whereupon she lifted her
still youthful heels lammed out a cou-
ple of wavy kicks to right and left
and trotted magnificently on to the
flat to bury her graying muzzle and
long teeth in the ankle-deep grass

  theyre going to try and plow with
that old speed horse aaron groaned
shes still good for a quarter of a mile
at a three-thirty clip lord wont the
dirt fly 

  next morning the fun began at an
early hour the man proving by every
movement he made that what he knew
about horses would fill many volumes
led old knock em dead-which was
the mares name-down to the flat the
girl followed the center of a set of
single work harness they left the
mare grazing and went back to the
enchanted ranch



cabin returning with the small plow
between them

  never occurred to em to make the
mare drag it down chuckled aaron
this is gonta be good-if nobody gets
hurt

  and now they packed the harrow
down

  when the mare was harnessed to the
plow-a feat that had required nearly
half an hour-there arose a lengthy
discussion down below as to ways and
means of starting the agricultural
project but at last it seemed to be de-
cided that they would begin operations
just below the cabin plow lengthwise
of the flat and end up at the creekside
when the work was done at once the
girl established herself between the
handles of the plow and the man took
the lines and began swaying them up
and down as a signal to knock em
dead that they were all set through
his telescope aaron noted the stern
look of determination on the face of
each get up get up floated up the
hillside

  immediately knock em dead got
up

  she gave a leap that stiffened the
tugs jerked the girl forward-all but
her feet-and started the man to trot-
ting another leap and the handles of
the plow left the girls hands she fell
flat on her face in the grass the plow
turned sidewise and went skidding
over the turf while the mare and her
driver went trotting rather gracefully
with the lines stiff between them

  the girl sprang nimbly to her feet
and began waving her hands after the
departing pair

  tell her whoa tell her whoa she
shouted shrilly i fell down

  the driver had not noticed this at
all he was too busy watching the

mare to see that the girl was not trot-
ting along with them

 whoa he responded whoa

  pull on the lines screamed the
girl pull hard and say whoa knock
em

  the man accordingly put more pres-
sure on the lines and repeated the
magic words knock em dead was
used to being driven with a tight line
and doubtless it had not occurred to
her at all that she was not traveling at
the required speed while she loved to
go and possessed an abominably hard
mouth she was an amenable old crea-
ture and as the driver added more
weight on the reins and continued to
call whoa she responded slowed
up and stopped

  running the girl rejoined the group
another lengthy discussion took place
the result was that knock em dead
and the plow were turned in a wide
circle that half covered the diameter
of the flat and returned to the start-
ing-post again

  once more the point of the plow was
inserted in the ground and the girl
stood between the handles her cheeks
aglow her eyes wide and expectant

  get up floated up the hillside

  and away they went again

  this time however the farmerette
was prepared when knock em dead
leaped forward she leaped forward
too so did the plow skinner at a good
clip they started down the flat imme-
diately the plow point came out of the
soil like a trout leaping for a fly the
running girl lifted the handles as she
probably had been told to do and the
plow point dived for the bowels of the
earth

  immediately the traces went taut
old knock em dead stopped leaped
forward stopped leaped stopped and


all western

shook her head angrily-and then be-
gan to stamp a nervous foot

  get up get up coaxed the pan

  knock em dead leaped once more
viciously nothing followed her she
was not accustomed to this if a buggy
or a racing sulky did not move when
she felt of it-well that was a funny
sort of buggy or sulky she knew noth-
ing whatever about that kind if it re-
fused to move with the ordinary pull
that she had been accustomed to give
for many years then it could not be
moved at all she stopped therefore
and lowered her muzzle to the grass

  get up get up raged the man
and get up get up the girls shrill
voice added

 knock em dead lifted her head
shook it rebelliously and pawed the
earth alarmingly

  another discussion another trial
another failure with results similar
tp those heretofore depicted then the
girl sat down hard on the ground and
began to cry the man wiped sweat
from his brow and looked down at her
commiseratingly patted knock em
deads neck in a sort of reproachful
manner then went and patted the
bowed head of the girl

  poor nuts grieved aaron rose i
wish i could help em out but i might
as well be ten miles from here theyll
never plow that strip o land with
knock em dead i doubt if i could do
it myself

  it was a world-worn girl who at last
lifted her head and got slowly to her
feet once more they tried to coax the
old mare to serve her new masters but
without avail so they sorrowfully un-
hitched her from the plow and took
off the harness they loosed her she
snorted kicked up her heels raced to
the other end of the fiat and buried

her nose in the grass

 with slow movements the man and
the girl dragged the plow to the higher
land threw the harness upon it and
went to the cabin

  five minutes later the girl had start-
ed to turn over the soil of the flat with
a spading fork

  aaron pulled his hair thatll take
her a lifetime he moaned my
heavens whats she thinking about
and why isnt her husband doing that
work instead of her ill go down and
hurt that fella yet

  for half an hour the girl spaded
earth clumsily and slowly she rested
often at the end of that period she
was looking at the palms of her hands
frequently and occasionally wetting
them at her lips but she worked
bravely on resting repeatedly

  then the man came out and after
what seemed to be an argument be-
tween them took the fork from her
hands he worked with more skill and
strength but he stopped often too
then suddenly he threw a hand over
his heart and swayed instantly the
girl was on her feet and had thrown
her arms about him he stood there
awkwardly head lowered then aaron
saw him smile and try to resume the
work

  but she grabbed the spading fork
out of his hands and stood with it be-
hind her when he tried to take it
away from her she ran from him
stopping a short distance off but well
out of his reach she lectured him em-
phatically with the result that he
walked to the cabin and disappeared

  once more the girl began the spad-
ing but aaron knew that her hands
were blistering fast and was not sur-
prised when she finally threw herself
down in the grass and hid her face 
enchanted ranch



against her arms he saw her comely
shoulders quivering and knew hat
sobs were shaking her body

 now aaron rose was a tender-
hearted man and quite unexpectedly
there raced down both cheeks two hot
tears

  angrily he absorbed them with his
shirt sleeve this is the limit he
growled angrily that fellas a help-
less invalid i guess and shes gonta
try and make a living for the both of
em down there theyll starve to
death theyre poor as church mice
or theyd never bought that worthless
piece o land what in the dickens can
i do for em

  the answer to this did not come to
him until long after the girl had given
up her hopeless task and gone into the
cabin for a rest but when it did come
about three oclock that afternoon he
acted upon it instantly

 chuckling at the wildness of his
plan and the fun that he knew it would
give him he crawled under the chap-
arral to the creek bottom there hid-
den from the cabin by fragrant bays
and alders he slipped down the creek
and had put many miles between him
and the john wharton place before
darkness came

           chapter six
           the magician

ed the light of oswald jacks to vanish
any moment but he had to wait an
hour before this occurred

  he allowed oz half an hour to drop
to sleep ten seconds probably would
have been sufficient but aaron was
taking no chances

  at the end of that time he arose and
walked toward the lower corral below
the big red barn

  here he entered a shed in which
odds and ends were kept he lighted
matches and finally discovered what
he sought-an old lead rope oz would
not miss it for he was not yet familiar
with the equipment of the ranch the
next thing that he appropriated was a
canvas plow collar one that had been
cast aside as having seen its day he
dared not go to the stable and get the
collar now in use for the horse he had
in mind oz jacks was plowing too
these days and that collar would be
missed the one on the john wharton
place he knew would not fit the enor-
mous column of one of his precious
clydes if it fit the scrawny neck of
knock em dead but this old collar
would answer for a short piece of
work then he found a sack and filled
it with rolled barley at the barn

  with the barley on his shoulder and
the other articles in hand he walked
down to the live oak pasture as it
was called and brought soft suspi-
cious snorts from his grazing herd of
work animals

  his voice was sufficient to allay
their fears aaron loved his horses and
the clydesdales loved aaron in a very
short time the old collar was about the
neck of omar khayyam the lead rope
looped in his mouth as a bit and the
sack of barley over his withers then
aaron leaped to the broad slick back
whereupon omar started obediently

still gleamed

aron rose lay close
  to the odious canal
  that crossed his prop-
  erty and had cost him
  so much money and
  worriment darkness
  had fallen but up at
  the house the lights
  hard-working ranchers

ordinarily retire early and he expect-


all western

for the stable doubtless thinking that
this was an odd hour of the twenty-
four to go to work

  a pat on his neck guided him the
rider turned him and they trotted
ponderously to the far end of the pas-
ture here aaron dismounted delib-
erately tore down his own rail fence
and led omar through the gap he
rode away leaving the fence as it was
the chances were ten to one that the
rest of the animals would not find the
gap and they were ten to one too
that if they did find it it never could
occur to them to wander through
such is the domestication of the pa-
tient home-loving clyde

  but oz jacks when he found omar
missing and saw the gap would imag-
ine that the horse was not true to
breed or had lost his senses when he
wandered away from his friends

  omars trot was a crime but aaron
kept him to it long before morning
they entered grapevine canyon and
stumbled up it over the stones half a
mile below the old john wharton
place aaron dismounted tied omar to
a tree deposited the barley close at
hand and went back to crawl to his
cave in the chaparral

  he was up at an unearthly hour it
was necessary for him to rise early in
order to cook his breakfast and drown
his campfire before the newcomers
were about for they must not see his
smoke the dawn was still gray when
he stole out and down the creek to
omar khayyam whom he found lying
down and sound asleep

  he roused the horse led him to the
creek for water and gave him a gen-
erous feed of barley watering him
again after he had eaten he begged
him to be patient until evening and
then hurried back to his rendezvous

omar could go without his noonday
meal in a cause like this

  all day long intermittently aaron
watched the girl trying to spade up
the cattle-patched land she had no
gloves it seemed but had tied hand-
kerchiefs about her burning hands

  once or twice the man came out to
help her but she would not allow it
she rested for an hour at a time but
bravely returned to her task again
what a pitifully small space she had
spaded up when evening came wea-
rily about four oclock she trailed to
the cabin the water buckets were full
she found for aaron had seen the man
sneak cautiously down to the spring
with them when her back was turned
he had set them down twice between
the spring and the cabin once aaron
thought the girl was about to catch
him at this forbidden task but she had
stopped her work only to watch a robin
filling his bill with the worms that she
had spaded up

  impatiently the watcher waited for
darkness when it came and he saw
the lights gleaming in the cabin win-
dows he hurried down and followed
the creek bed to his horse he watered
and fed him then rode him up the
canyon

  some time had elapsed and now the
cabin lights were out he waited half
an hour to make sure that the occu-
pants were asleep then led omar
across the flat and up to the little
plow

  in no time the tangled harness was
straightened out and omar into it
aaron hitched him to the plow he set
the point and a soft flip of one line
started omar on his accustomed task

 never before had omars master
made him walk so fast and never be-
fore had he plowed at night but what
enchanted ranch



mattered it all things were well with
omar when this man directed his
destiny

  in regular even rows the soil rolled
from the mold board the only sound
was the soft thud of omars immense
feet as they trod the matted grass
furrow aftwr furrow appeared as if
by magic gradually the land turned
blacker and blacker under the moon
as the plowers weaving back and
forth neared the creek the last fur-
row was turned at two oclock in the
morning they harrowed the piece
twice in three-quarters of an hour

 then aaron rose had another in-
spiration he left the plow close to the
completion of the work at the end of
the last furrow he left the harrow in-
stead of dragging it back to the place
where he had found it he unharness-
ed the clyde and laid the harness on
the ground leaving the traces still
hooked to the single-tree he went for
knock em deads collar and laid it
where it would be if the old mare had
plowed and harrowed the land while
the ranchers slept and had jumped
out of her harness when she had fin-
ished

  then the big boy-man called aaron
rose chuckling happily rode omar
down the canyon and back toward
rose ranch loosing the horse in the
county road two miles from home he
dog-trotted most of the way back to
grapevine creek in order to be on
hand when the girl came out to spade
that morning

  diantha stanley was cooking break-
fast over the little second-hand wood
stove that she and her brother had ac-
quired when they started on their
great adventure duncan had risen be-
fore her and begun work on his book

the one over which he had been toiling
for thirteen years-the book that had
ruined his health and which seemed
destined never to be completed it was
a book of general science and science
was progressing with such leaps and
bounds that duncan was obliged to re-
vise and revise and revise his book
continually

  their hoijne had been san francisco
where she had worked as a typist
while duncan pursued his studies he
had no college degree but he was an
ardent student and by dint of hard
work and what seemed almost bound-
less scientific knowledge hoped to
overcome this drawback she had been
able to support him and now and then
he had earned a little from lectures
that he delivered

 then while they were struggling
bravely and managing to make both
ends meet came the bitter blow he
had dropped in the street one day
taken to the emergency hospital
where he had been resuscitated his
case had been diagnosed as angina pec-
toris a rather rare disease of the heart
he was advised to renounce tobacco
alcoholic liquors and coffee he must
do no more physical work than abso-
lutely necessary and he must not
study so hard furthermore he ought
to leave the city and get out into the
open air of the country

  so to make a long story short here
they were on the john wharton place
which they had bought with the re-
turns from a sacrifice sale of the prop-
erty in which they lived in san fran-
cisco they were orphans and the
property had been left to them at the
fathers death there had been four
hundred and eighty dollars remaining
after they had paid seven hundred for
the place moved their belongings to




all western

a village at the head of grapevine
creek and bought a months supplies
now seventy-five dollars of that was
gone and was represented by knock
em dead and the equipment with
which she was supposed to farm for
them

  both brother and sister were lovers
of nature they had fanciful hopes that
they could live off the soil until vol-
ume i was completed then the royal-
ties would come rolling in while dun-
can turned out volume ii living on
vegetables and berries and eggs-they
meant to buy hens later-they wrould
whirl through volume ii and when it
was offered to the public they would
be independently rich	

  it is not a very new story at that

  but knock em dead refused to till
the land and they were seventy-five
dollars out at the very start however
she would take them in the buggy for
their mail and supplies and if ever
diantha could get the garden spot
spaded up and seeded it would be no
time until the vegetables would be up
she knew just how to raise them
there were instructions on the back
of every package of seeds

  but this morning as she fried bacon
and eggs grave doubts assailed her
all of her hopefulness seemed gone
duncan working away furiously with
his pencil and countless notes was not
worried at all it seemed he was al-
ways that way when at work but one
can think of mundane matters while
frying eggs and diantha did a terri-
ble black cloud seemed to be hanging
over them she knew in her heart of
hearts that she would die before that
land was spaded up and if she did not
die the soil would be too dry for plant-
ing before she-

  ouch

  she had taken hold of the frying pan
to turn the eggs and her blistered
hands responded instantly to the heat
of the iron handle

  what were they to do her dark
eyes grew tragic everything looked
hopeless-black as ink oh why had
they been such fools

  with a heart-rending sigh she
stepped out onto the rickety porch for
a dipperful of water to add to the boil-
ing coffee in a weary way she glanced
down at the flat

  the dipper dropped from her hand
she stared like a somnambulist asleep
with both eyes open her lips parted
she closed her eyes wearily while it
seemed that her brain was swimming
off into space was she ill

  she opened her eyes again then-
duncan duncan she shrieked i-
i believe im losing my mind come
here quick

  she was standing in a tragic attitude
when the running man reached her
side

  duncan look she gulped once
then closed her eyes and breathed
huskily

  for several seconds he stood with
his arm about her slim waist the time
was so long that she opened her eyes
again

  say something she whispered
am i crazy what is it

  suffering cats he gasped

  lets-lets go see what it means-
whats the matter she stammered ex-
citedly

  half running hand in hand they
hurried down to the flat where he
stooped and ran his long white fingers
through the mellow soil

  its-its done he decided scien-
tifically yes sir its done but who
did it
enchanted ranch



  she pointed theres the plow over
there lets go look at it

  they hurried across the harrowed
land to bend over the mysterious plow
that had worked for them in the night
here too just at the end of the work
lay the magic harrow and to the sin-
gle-tree was hooked the traces and
the harness and collar lay on the
ground as if knock em dead had
sprung out of them when her task was
done there was knock em dead
grazing peacefully on the slope of the
hill

  i-i wonder if shed show signs of
peispiration dune said diantha in
an awed little voice

  lets go see he replied

 and as they later stood one on
either side of the dry and wondering
knock em dead the magician hid-
den in the chaparral above them
laughed until the tears ran down his
sun-bronzed cheeks who wanted to go
to new york city in quest of amuse-
ment

chapter seven
a piece of paper sack

uncan stanley
 brushed the long
 black hair back from
 his eyes and gazed
 speculatively from
 knock em dead to
 the marvelous imple-
 ments across the field

  its scientifically impossible he
gravely decided yes sir scientifical-
ly impossible

  this point settled he thought to re-
mind diantha that the breakfast might
be burning so they hurried to the
cabin

 breakfast was burning but they

cooked more

  i know what has happened the
sister burst out suddenly breaking
more eggs over the pan that old fel-
low brooks has done this i just know
it dune he knew when he sold knock
em dead to us that she wouldnt plow
you remember he said she might so
after wed gone with her his con-
science got to troubling him and he
came down last night with a farm
horse and did the job hoping wed be
mystified and never think to attribute
it to him well we were mystified for
a time all right she added with a
complacent smile of one who is not de-
ceived but we know who did it shall
we mention it to him or not-thank
him you know-and try to pass it off
as a joke

  her studious-minded brother gave
this careful consideration duncan
stanley did not believe in deciding
upon a matter until his scientific mind
had weighed it pro and con

  i believe i wouldnt mention it to
him at all was his conclusion it
might embarrass him greatly and
now that the plowing and harrowing
are done what does it matter if he did
sting us knock em dead is good as
a buggy horse and well need her for
that

  but what about other work she
asked

  perhaps shell learn in time he
said why worry the land is well
prepared for seeding all we have to
do is to seed and by the time volume
i is out three months we can buy
twenty plow horses if we want to and
put moleskin blankets on em during
the winter but well get one of these
little garden tractors then i guess
ive always wanted to monkey with
some sort of machinery if such stupid


all western

people as i have met can get results
with machinery what ought not i to
accomplish

  how you hate yourself duncan
she laughed

  of course as usual diantha you
mean just the contrary is it against
me that i have confidence in myself
i should know what i am capable of
doing

  certainly certainly dune dont
try to start a quarrel lets eat-the
eggs are ready anyway and surely the
coffees boiled sick im anxious to get
at the planting now

  of course he agreed drawing his
chair up to the table

  whatll we plant first murmured
diantha pouring out his coffee

  what do you like best of all the
vegetables

  watermelon was her prompt re-
turn

  citrullus vulgaris he mused a
vegetable decidedly from the neck
down with an ellipsoidal head that
surely must be fruit has a very low
food value id say but if you yearn
for watermelon little one watermelon
seed shall go first into the ground
next choice

  muskmelon

  live longer on them i guess num-
ber two is muskmelon and number
three

  diantha placed the remainder of the
breakfast on the table and seated her-
self opposite him

  lets see she said thoughtfully
i think i like roasting ears next best
but you choose one dune

  sirloin steak replied duncan

  then they both laughed

  honestly i dont like any of em
he continued but weve get to live
on vegetables so ill drive myself to

it well decide on my first three to-
night i fancy attending to the melons
and the corn will take about all the
time that i can spare this morning
im right in the middle of aristotle
now and cant think too much about
garden stuff old aristotle is a bear-
hes giving me a lot of trouble that old
bird think youll have time to type a
couple of chapters today

  plenty she told him cheerfully
which goes to prove that the happy
carefree life of a rancher permits him
plenty of time for mental stimulation

  shortly after breakfast the forti-
tudinous pair fared forth with hoe and
rake and packages of seeds

  watermelon first said duncan as
they reached the cultivated land then
he read the instructions on the back
of the package of seeds

  when all danger from frost is past
plant from ten to twelve seeds in hills
about six inches apart leaving five feet
each way between hills

  he frowned at it simple concise
and quite unmistakable he remarked
lets make the first hill right here
diantha

  eagerly they went to work diantha
poked her index finger into the
ground and duncan dropped a seed in
the hole and sifted loose soil in on top
of it they treated a dozen seeds in
this fashion forming a circle with
them then duncan took two steps and
indicated the spot for another hill

 up in the chaparral aaron rose
watched them through his telescope
what they plantin i wonder he
muttered something in hills seems
cucumbers squash pumpkins melons
-something like that any one of em
will be frozen stiff the first night after
the plant breaks through the surface
of the ground poor nuts
enchanted ranch



  throughout the morning he watch-
ed the operations down below and
just before noon-for the work re-
quired more time than the brother and
sister had counted upon-aaron de-
cided that they were planting a row of
corn close to the creek bed

  his agricultural instinct was out-
raged grapevine canyon was low and
cold vegetables that were very sus-
ceptible to frost ought not to be plant-
ed before the first of june their work
was only a waste of time how could
he let them know their ignorance and
make them conform with mother na-
tures inexorable laws

 then night settled down there
came the hum of insects over the chap-
arral the sweet odors of budding wil-
lows floated up from grapevine creek
to the nostrils of the lonely man on
the hill from the falcon river over
the ridge came the low rumble of a
gold dredger working trere in the
green waters coyotes began their
good evenings to one another in
the cabin down below lights gleamed
brightly

  now aaron was free to build a tiny
fire and cook his supper after eating
he crawled down to the creek with his
empty canvas water pails he returned
to his cave lighted a candle in its
mouth and sat reading one of his
favorite persian poets

  why what on earth is this

  diantha stanley had stopped on her
way to the spot where they had left
off planting corn the day before dun-
can slightly behind her stopped also
for he too had seen a stick stuck up-
right in the ground held by a cleft in
the top of the stick a piece of paper
fluttered gently in the soft morning
breeze

  diantha stooped and pulled the stick
from the soil the paper a piece torn
from a yellow grocery sack was folded
twice duncan looked over her shoul-
der and together they read

  for heavens sake dont you knoiv
any better than to plant sweet corn
and melons this time of year get some
shallow boxes and put some rich soil
in them plant your melon seed in
them and keep them well watered
give them sun in daytime and carry
them into the house at night when
they are about five inches high trans-
plant them in your garden and in the
meantime have other plants growing
in boxes two weeks younger so that
if frost gets the first ones you can try
again do the same with cucumbers
squash pumpkins and tomatoes bet-
ter let the sweet com go until about
the first of june then plant several
rows side by side instead of one long
row it will pollenize better that way
dont plant sweet potatoes radishes
celery cauliflower or beans until you
plant the corn plant now peas beets
cabbage carrots lettuce onions pota-
toes spinach and turnips your springs
are late in this canyon but how are
you going to water the other things
when the creek goes dry anywhere
from the middle of june to the middle
of july 

yours truly

the magician

  well goodness gracious exclaim-
ed diantha somebodys taking a
pretty lively interest in our personal
affairs

 duncan gave the note judicious
thought

  its printed he remarked on a
piece of paper sack that had a notched
edge on top which is the only edge
that a paper sack has

chapter eight
diantha signs her name

ft dune the romance
of it cried diantha
her dark eyes shining
who cares what it is
written on the ques-
tion is who wrote it
that replied her
brother with his usual
gravity is more or less problemat-
ical

  more i should say the girl re-
torted why this is the most myste-
rious thing i ever heard of im con-
vinced now that brooks lias nothing
to do with it this is an enchanted
ranch dune

  her black eyes were sparkling and
her red lips were parted with excite-
ment she would have moved most
men to her fanciful way of thinking
but not her studious-minded brother
duncan only looked at her specula-
tively and tried to solve the vexing
problem

  of course he said we both know
that you are all wrong to talk of en-
chanted ground is utter rot what we
want is fact diantha now who wrote
that impertinent note

  impertinent

  certainly this is our property and
we shall handle it as our judgment
dictates no one is going to tell us what
to do

  diantha read the note over again
it sounds experienced she mused
seems as if the writer knew what he
was talking about i am in favor of
following his instructions after all
dune what do we know about farm-
ing

  we can learn he told her

  by bitter experience yes but why

 not profit by the experience of our
 magician and what he writes about
 the uater giving out in june worries
 me

   we were told that this creek runs
 the year round diantha he reminded
 her

   we were told also she shot back
 that knock em dead would plow
 and harrow for us

   after a long period of thought he
 asked soberly do you mean to inti-
 mate diantha that you and i are
 suckers

   suckers is right she answered
 promptly

   perhaps we are he said i am al-
 ways willing to accept any seemingly
 logical theory until it has been proved
 completely untenable then assuming
 that we are suckers what shall we
 do

   act upon the advice of the magi-
 cian plantwhat he tells us to plant
 and refrain from planting other things
 and in the meantime well ask him to
 answer his own question about the
 water

  how

   write him a note and ask that
 since he has taken it upon himself to
 control the destinies of this ranch he
 be so kind as to solve our water prob-
 lem for us instead of questioning us as
 to what we intend to do for my part
 i dont know do you

   not yet admitted duncan but
 how will you get your note to-to-er
 -him

   slip it into the slot in this same
 stick she said

   we might give it a trial he agreed

 but you must attend to that its too
 trivial for me

   trivial sniffed diantha its the
 most delightfully romantic thing i
enchanted ranch



ever heard of oh i just love the ma-
gician then she quickly placed a
hand across her mouth opened guilt-
ily you dont suppose he heard that
do you dune she muttered through
her fingers

  to this her brother retorted piffle
and mundanely gripped the hoe

 they spent the morning preparing
beds for such vegetable seed as the
magician had advised them to plant
now and that afternoon while duncan
was at work on his book his sister did
the planting about three oclock she
went into the cabin and typed this mes-
sage to their unknown adviser

dear magician

  we thank you for the plowing and
harrowing and the planting instruc-
tions we are following the instruc-
tions to the letter we hope that you
will continue to control our destinies
here on the enchanted ranch for we
are beginning to believe that we must
depend on you for success

 wont you please answer your own
question about the water we under-
stood when we bought the place that
the creek would continue to run the
year round if it goes dry in june
what in the name of heaven are we
to do anyway you frighten us

  she leaned back from her typewriter
and read the note to duncan at first
he disapproved of her consigning the
fate of their project to their unknown
friend but gradually his sister talked
him down from his high scientific
horse

 how shall i sign it dune she
asked

   the suckers of course he sug-
gested promptly

  no i wont since youll have noth-
ing to do with it im going to take
the responsibility myself ill sign it

diantha 

  and diantha it was signed

  up in the chaparral the brass tube
of aaron roses telescope was follow-
ing the girl as she walked deliberately
to the cloven stick that had held the
magicians note that morning she had
thrust it back into the soil where she
had found it now she reached it and
plucked it out and inserted her note
in the slit she replaced the stick in
the ground then turned slowly and
searched the surrounding hills with
her eyes

  the evening quiet was upon the lit-
tle valley frogs croaked beside the
creek from the chaparral to the south
came the admonitory call of a cock
valley quail perched sentrylike on
some overtopping bush

  cut that out cut that out

 i wont shouted the girl and
laughed at the echoes of her voice

  from over the steep ridge back of
the property came the dull clankety-
clank of the gold dredger tearing
away the banks of the beautiful fal-
con a coyote laughed as he mounted
a bald summit and surveyed his broad
domain spring smells were sweet in
the air the creek crooned to itself as
it journeyed to the sea

  then suddenly the girl lifted her
clear contralto and catching the con-
tagion of natures joyfulness cried to
the solemn hills good night magi-
cian

  she waited breathlessly but her on-
ly answer was the laugh of the lone
coyote on the baldpate knob

  aaron caught his breath as he heard
her voice he could not afford to shout
a response though he wanted to
through his strong lens her pretty
youthful face was tense with expect-


all western

ancy he saw her parted lips her flash-
ing eyes her bosom rising and falling
softly he heaved a sigh as she turned
disappointed and walked slowly to the
cabin

  dont be an utter idiot he growled
at himself shes that mans wife

  and he lighted a candle in his cave
to console himself with his persian
poets

  im a fool he said a reglar fool
i hadnt ought to started this thing i
came here for business and that wom-
ans made an ass of me

  he turned the pages of a small book
idly and before he realized it he was
reading

do what thy manhood bids thee do
from none but self expect applause
he noblest lives and noblest dies
who makes and keeps his self-made
laws

all other life is living death

a world where none but phantoms
   dwell

a breath a wind a sound a voice

a tinkling of the camel-bell

  all right old-timer said aaron to
the poet well let er go at that

 an hour later he slipped down
through the chaparral and took dian-
thas note from the cloven stick the
lights were still agleam in the cabin
windows so he carried it back to his
cave to read

  another hour passed while he sat in
a dreamy mood occasionally pro-
nouncing the name diantha then he
tore a strip from one of his grocery
sacks and printed his reply on it even-
tually it found its way into the cleft on
the stick and was there when diantha
came out next morning

chapter nine
the man with the burro

hat morning the girl
  read

  dear diantha 
so you think the lit-
tle ranch is enchant-
ed eh well maybe
it is anyway it seems
to be growing more
beautiful every day but you must be
practical you cant exist on the beau-
ties of natzire you know so heres
the magicians answer to the water
qxlestion and pm afraid its not a very
good one

  that big round pool in the creek be-
low the little falls is pretty deep some
seasons pve noticed water in it as long
as three months after the creek stop-
ped running i think that perhaps wa-
ter seeps into it from some hillside
spring but of this i cant be certain
it is so well shaded that maybe the
lack of evaporation by the sun causes
the water to remain there so long
anyway it is your only hope

  you must get a small gasoline en-
gine and a small pump and when the
creek stops running and you can no
longer bring the water onto your gar-
den by gravity you must pump it from
the hole below the falls it is just pos-
sible that with the rather heavy rains
we had last winter you can pump
enough to keep your things growing
until they have matured but you must
save your water once you start to
pump dont waste it youll have grav-
ity water until the first of june any-
way and you neednt buy your engine
until shortly before then youll see
the creek lowering and be warned in
time

if i were a real magician i suppose
enchanted ranch



i could order the creek to continue its
flowing but alas i am not a real ma-
gician

  this xoill probably be my last com-
munication to you so good-by and good
luck to yourself and your husband

                   sincerely

the magician
my husband cried diantha
oh i must set him right about that
then her face grew very red as her
brother regarded her with his owlish
sincerity

  why he asked

  oh i dont know she replied
i-im just foolish i dont know why
i said that

  you are foolish diantha he told
her but what about the engine
can we afford one what will a
pump and engine cost

  i havent the remotest idea he re-
plied

  well have to ask the magician
she determined he cant quit us now
-i wont let him

  whatll we plant this morning
asked duncan turning away in high
disgust

  that night another typed note was
thrust into the cleft in the upright
stick and aaron rose saw it was de-
posited he was reading it at nine
oclock

dear magician

  you mustnt quit us now we have
come to depend upon you we dont
know what an engine and pump will
cost nor what kind to get nor what
size or anything wont you tell us all
about itf-and how to run it dont go
away dont take away the enchant-
ment of the enchanted ranch we
must raise a garden to live we have
almost all of our money invested in
this ranch

 our names are duncan and diantha
stanley and were from san francis-
co my brother is going to make a for-
tune some day with a set of scientific
books that he is writing volume i fo
nearly ready for the publisher now
we must hold out here and live until
it is offered to the public then well
try to repay you for your interest and
kindness

diantha

  aaron rose gazed into the red light
of the candle idly folding the note in
his big fingers his heart was beating
swifter his blue eyes were brighter

   my brother  he repeated softly
thats different yes ill tell the
world thats different

  next morning at ten oclock aaron
squatted at the mouth of his cave with
the telescope trained on the distant
ridge between the enchanted ranch
and the falcon river a man driving
a laden burro ahead of him slowly
picked his way through the chaparral
along the ridge for this mans passing
aaron rose had been waiting patient-
ly many days and now that he had
come in sight aaron merely watched
his progress through the chaparral
and made no move whatever they
went from sight the man and the
laden ass and aaron trained his tele-
scope on the flat below where diantha
was filling shallow boxes with rich
earth in which to plant tomato seed

  hell be makin another trip next
month mused aaron and i got lots
o grub everybody expects me to stay
in new york four or five months any-
way theres lots o time i gotta keep
this ranch enchanted since-since hes
only her brother

 so aaron sat down and wrote an
elaborate letter telling diantha about
the pump and advising her to invest


all western

in chickens

  that same day diantha and duncan
drove knock em dead up the road of
surprises in quest of hens an engine
and a pump

  when they drove back in the middle
of the afternoon aaron watching
through his telescope saw that they
were not alone a man tailed the
bouncing buggy on a big sorrel horse

  there was no mistaking that im-
mense pyramidal head and the huge
shoulders he was cyrus hurley head
zanjero for the water company that
had ruined the scenic beauty of the
rose ranch with its new lateral canal

           chapter ten
dry days

 hat was cy hurley do-
  ing on the enchanted
  ranch

  this was the ques-
  tion uppermost in the
  mind of aaron rose
  as he watched his old
  	enemy swing from the

saddle and aid the stanleys in the un-
loading of their buggy the zanjero
so far as aaron could determine had
no business which would take him in-
to grapevine canyon the canyon was
out of the water district all of the
companys ditch lines were on the
other side of the hills in which aaron
was hiding where lay the pick of the
foothill land no cy hurley had no
business here at all and aaron did not
like it

  they removed a crate tied on be-
hind which evidently contained chick-
ens then came groceries and other
necessities and poultry netting the
zanjero loosed the hens which went
contentedly about their daily task of

hunting for things

  the three sat together before the
cabin for half an hour and finally cy-
rus accompanied them within a little
later aaron saw him washing his face
in a basin on the porch he was stay-
ing for supper it seemed

  what if they tell him about me was
aarons concerned thought and whats
he doin here anyway

  cyrus rode away shortly after dusk
the girl waving after him from the
porch then she hurried into the
house and ten minutes later aaron
was just barely able to see her figure
as she hurried with a note to the
notched stick in the garden

  the cabin lights had been agleam an
hour before he felt safe to crawl down
and secure it he read

dear magician

  we have bought hens and a rooster
and some poultry netting the old
chicken house will do i guess also we
were able to buy a cheap little gaso-
line engine and a pump from a mr
hurley who rode down with us horse-
back today to see how the road was
he thinks he can get in with the en-
gine in a wagon and will deliver it to-
morrow and show us how to run it
he seems very kind and considerate
hes something for the ivater company
i cant remember it and couldnt spell
it if i did its spanish the hens and
rooster are dear things and seem to
like us already they went to bed in
the old chicken house without iis hav-
ing to drive them or even suggest it

  ill get at the mending of the fence
as soon as i can but mr hurley said
hed tell everybody that we have
moved in here aid ask them to keep
their cattle away hes very kind to us
and offered to help us any way that he
could
enchanted ranch



  but i didnt tell him about you that
might break the spell and take away
the enchantment i wonder who you
are anyway and where you are cant
you let me knoiv i want to know xvhat
you look like cant you leave your
photograph in the notched stickt ill
return it promptly or are you a spirit
that cannot be photographed and
why are you helping us so much how
can we ever show our appreciation

                    very sincerely
                            diantha

  for a long time in the light of his
sputtering candle the owner of the
rose ranch sat holding the letter i
wonder if she would like my looks
was the tenor of his musings but ive
got no picture to show her anyway
wouldnt dare take a chance if i did
have

  after this the days passed swiftly
and spring marched on apace the ma-
gician and diantha exchanged many
letters all sent and received through
the post-office stick while the moon
was bright aaron helped to mend the
fence stealing down and picking up
the tools where the girl had left them
it was necessary only to stretch the
old rusty barbed wire across both
ends of the canyon and run it well into
the deep chaparral on either side for
the dense brush covering of the hills
made an impenetrable barrier on the
north and south

 when diantha and duncan had com-
pleted their chicken lot aaron sneak-
ed down one night and banked it all
about with dirt to make it more dif-
ficult for carniverous animals to crawl
under it

  daily his letters guided their simple
operations-simple to him but vastly
complicated to their inexperienced
minds cy hurley had driven in with

the engine artd the pump-a sorry out-
fit which aaron knew he had long ago
discarded for a better one they set it
up beside the deep pool and cy work-
ed industriously at laying the two-inch
pipe line to the site of a prospective
ditch which would border the garden
the engine coughed and stuttered and
wheezed when they set it going but it
ran and poured a sizeable stream of
water from the end of the pipe line
now diantha started digging her ditch
by hand and in one nights work
aaron completed it for which he was
fervently thanked

  so ran the days and nights on the
enchantpd ranch and once more the
traveler and the burro passed along
the ridge between the falcon and him
who hid in the chaparral once more
the man told himself that there would
be another trip next month and con-
tinued his secret vigil over the en-
chanted ranch

  hurley was coming frequently ev-
ery two or three days he put in his
appearance and aaron wondered if his
job were not suffering and his assis-
tants muttering vague complaints
aaron sighed with jealousy he knew
well what brought hurley to the en-
chanted ranch why he had worked
industriously at laying the pipe line
and persuading the old engine to
stammer metallically again diantha
was the answer but aaron had cau-
tioned her to tell nobody of his strange
administration of the ranch and she
had promised faithfully

  the green things were up and the
pseudo-ranchers were irrigating them
with gravity water taken from the
creek at a point a hundred yards above
the garden everything was growing
well and the face of the girl showed
happiness there had been some vege-


all western

tables for the table but by far the most
prolific crop that the enchanted
ranch had delivered was grasshoppers
for the rooster and his harem the
heat was growing too and gradually
day by day the creek was gurgling
softer notes as it receded from its wet
silt banks

  then came an afternoon when there
was but a tiny trickle into the deep
pool below the little falls next day at
about eleven oclock the creek had
ceased to run ranchers above the
stanleys were taking all the water it
ran again during the night and up un-
til the heat of the following day then
ceased again entirely pools began to
dry up in the fierce heat of june in a
weeks time the only water that re-
mained save for shallow pools here
and there that were alive with tad-
poles and baby trout destined to die
before maturity was that in the deep
hole beneath the dead waterfall

  the beans cauliflower corn cucum-
bers sweet potatoes melons squash
and tomatoes were in and growing
nicely they would be thirsty soon it
was time to test the endurance of the
water supply in the pool

  start pumping tomorrow morning
aaron rose printed on a paper sack
theres only about two feet of soil un-
der your plants under that are nigger-
head boulders down to bedrock so ir-
rigate lightly and often rather than
give the ground a thorough soaking at
long intervals if you do that the wa-
ter will only seep through to the nig-
ger-heads and run back into the creek
bed you are now at the critical period
if the pool holds out and your engine
too youll have a fine garden ill help
you all i can

  so having read this communication
diantha and duncan started the engine

at nine oclock the following morning

  everything worked beautifully the
engine hesitated and stuttered but it
kept a stream of water flowing from
the end of the two-inch pipe diantha
and duncan worked ahead of the flow
making furrows between the plant
rows with their hoes aaron looked on
through his telescope with a sense of
satisfaction but about eleven oclock
he noticed the alarming shallowness
of the pool

  theyll pump her clean dry before
noon he surmised then we can see
whether or not im right about a seep-
age from hillside springs theyll have
to run water again in about five days
if the seepage amounts to anything
the pool ought to fill again in that
time

  the pool went dry about one oclock
but the garden had received plenty of
water for that irrigation next day the
ranchers covered their furrows with
loose earth and two days afterward
they cultivated with rake and hoe

  but the pool was not filling and
what little water remained below the
reach of the little pump was fast be-
ing sucked up by the sun three days
more went by and the mud in the bot-
tom of the pool was dry and cracking
into shards aaron had been getting
his water since the creek gave out
from a spring a good distance down
the canyon diantha wrote him a note
fraught with alarm would their spring
go dry too she asked

  aarons return note reassured her
on this point he had never known the
spring on the old john wharton place
to cease its flowing they had better
dig a small reservoir below it and com-
pound the water that went to waste
during the night they could siphon
it out he said and carry it to the
enchanted ranch



thirsting plants through their pipe
line it would not be much but it
might save some things

  for three days the brother and sis-
ter worked in following these sugges-
tions they unjointed the pipe and
carried it below the spring where they
screwed the joints together again

  they dug a tiny reservoir with great
effort and it filled to overflowing the
first night after its completion they
had driven out with knock em dead
and secured a short length of hose
and now diantha practiced sucking
the water through it to start the si-
phoning process when it was flowing
freely she thrust the end of the hose
in the two-inch pipe which carried the
water to the garden

  but in an hour and a half the reser-
voir was empty

  before their eyes now the plants
were wilting the flow from the spring
was not sufficient to take care of the
cucumbers and melons-all exception-
ally thirsty plants aaron saw the de-
spair in the eyes of both the threat-
ened loss of their garden loomed as a
tragedy for their account in the bank
was very low

  aaron rose too was in despair two
more hot days and the garden would
be only a bitter memory it must have
water immediately to survive-and
there was no water rain was out of
the question no one thinks of rain in
california after the middle of may
and the middle of may was a month
behind them

  oh magician cant you do some-
thing diantha wrote piteously youve
helped us so much-youve worked
such marvels has your magic desert-
ed you is the enchantment of the en-
chanted ranch a mockery we must
live we must live here volume i is

nearly finished we must hold out
some way until it is published and the
royalties start it will be a year per-
haps before we can realize anything
on it were almost broke we were de-
pending entirely on our garden oh
magician cant you save our garden
wave your wand once more

                   imploringly

diantha

  with tired steps she walked through
the wilting greenery to the post-office
stick where she inserted the note in
the slit she returned slowly to the
house as the cool of evening wrapped
itself about the little valley supper
was over duncan was straining his
eyes at a western window reading the
latest scientific magazine the scien-
tific magazines were so expensive and
they just had to continue their sub-
scriptions a library was not within
their reach duncan had to have mag-
azines she sat down on the porch and
rested her forehead against one of the
ancient pillars then slowly the tears
began to trickle down her cheeks

          chapter eleven
          the water trail

he sun arose on an-
other day the air felt
warm and dry with
none of the usual
freshness of the cali-
fornia morning the
early rays streaming
in her window awoke
diantha she turned over in bed sigh-
ing wearily when she remembered her
troubles and tried to slip into forget-
fulness once more but she could not
sleep so she climbed out of bed and
dressed

  she built a fire in the stove then


all western

went to the spring with her empty
pails she filled them and set them
down to look over the wilting garden
the plants had revived during the
cool night just passed and looked even
thrifty but diantha knew that that
bright look would depart when the sun
had climbed his ladder in the sky

  a faint familiar tinkling caught her
ear she had missed it so much since
the creek went dry-the music of the
ever diminishing waterfall

  she turned her eyes toward the pool
into which early in the spring the
water had splashed uproariously the
rays of the climbing sun were shot
back at her as from a mirror and once
more she stood spellbound and speech-
less on the enchanted ranch

  the pool beneath the falls was brim-
ming full and into it a thin stream of
water still trickled happily

  she rubbed her eyes she was asleep
she opened them again and looked

  the magic pool still cast back the
golden beams of the sun and a huge
crane swooped down from the sky and
settled lightly on its bank great wings
outspread for balance

  this said diantha carefully is
impossible im sound asleep or-or
dead

  and then she ran for the pool of
water at which the great crane awk-
wardly took wing and sailed away
over the trees long legs dragging the
air at the pool the girl stooped and
thrust her hand into thev clear cold
water up to the elbow

  the magician she muttered and
hurried to the cloven stick

  with feverish haste she removed the
piece of folded yellow sack and read
dear diantha

  it teas hard and required every atom
of my mysterious poiver but i accom-

plished it start the pump immediately
after breakfast and get the water to
going before the heavy evaporation
sets in my magic may not be able to
fill the pool again

                 faithfully

the magician

  to anticipate the delighted astonish-
ment of the brother and sister is be-
yond words the magician had done it
both halfway believed but how had
he done it as they worked that morn-
ing at carrying the pipe back to the
pool and stretching it along its old
course to the ditch they asked each
other this question a hundred times in
a hundred different ways but found
no answer that the water had come
down the dry creek bed was plainly
evident but what had caused it to
come a cloudburst farther up the val-
ley duncans scientific mind was in-
clined to this explanation and they
meant to inquire when next they rode
out of the canyon but diantha held to
the belief that her magician had work-
ed this miracle despite the scoffing of
her brother he had intimated in his
note that it was the work of his hands
she believed him

  the old engine was snorting the
pump revolving and water trickling
down the furrows to the eager plants
when cyrus hurley rode in on his big
sorrel horse he left the horse before
the cabin and strode down to the gar-
den to talk with the ranchers while
they worked at the distribution of the
water

  he looked at them in an odd way
diantha thought and there was a
twitching at one corner of his mouth
he gazed often at the pool of water
and remarked once that he had
thought it would be dry by this time
duncan started to speak but diantha
enchanted ranch



nudged him and gave him a significant
look duncan shrugged his lean shoul-
ders and went on hoeing a furrow

  does it ever rain up here this time
of year the girl asked innocently at
last

  very seldom cy informed her
and when it does it dont amount to
nothin

  ever have any cloudbursts asked
he of the scientific mind

  i guess so-now and then cant
remember any though why you
askin mr stanley

  i was just figuring on a possible
way to keep our garden going after
the pool goes dry again said duncan

  diantha gave him a warning look

  again repeated the zanjero

  she looked up her face flushed she
found cyrus devouring her with his
dark eyes he smiled as his glance en-
countered hers and slowly one eyelid
drooped in a crafty wink

  duncan had begun a labored ex-
planation of his use of the word
again but hurley was telling the
girl that he merely had dropped in on
them a moment having been in the
canyon looking for some stray cows of
his and must be getting back to his
work he commented on the healthy
look of their garden which look if it
existed was of very recent origin and
walked back to his sorrel horse he
waved good-by at the gate and the
horse pressed his way through the
chaparral to the road

  during the hight what was perhaps
the greatest catastrophe yet overtook
the enchanted ranch a jack rabbit
wandering from the chaparral in
search of something green discovered
the garden and sojourned in a region
of delectability muskmelon vines cu-
cumber vines peas beans-all were

laid low by his long sharp teeth this
thought poor diantha was the un-
kindest cut of all they could not af-
ford the money to buy more poultry
netting to keep the rabbits out a
dozen or more handsome plants had
fallen prey to this new menace the
rabbit would come again and bring
his family they would tell others and
other families would come to the feast
of salad the pool was empty of water
again but they were used to wonders
now and expected it to fill at any time
but how could they fight the rabbits

  diantha had seen the down plants
from her window and had hurried out
to them the night before she had left
a note in the cloven stick thanking the
magician for the brimming pool the
devastated portion of the garden had
claimed her thoughts till now but on
her hurried way back to make report
to duncan she saw the familiar bit of
yellow paper in the cleft she changed
course and plucked it out to read
dear diantha

  its just too bad thats all i saw
what theyd done to the cukes and
melons first thing this morning i sup-
pose you cant afford to buy poultry
netting it would cost a lot to fence
that plot and would take a lot of time
too much work too for one seasors
garden youll remember youre not
going to be here next year

  so heres the magicians suggestion
go up the road about a mile and turn
off up the little canyon on the right
just beyond the big rock that over-
hangs the road you know it there
are big black oaks above it and one
of them is growing right out of the
stone and leaning over the road and
the creek well follow that canyon to
its beginning then cut off toward the
north over the hills youll presently
	all western

i

see a big blasted bigger pine keep on
past it in the same direction and youll
come to a cow trail that meanders
through the chaparral toward the fal-
con river after youve folloioed it
about an eighth of a mile youll sud-
denly find the land dropping aivay be-
low you over a thousand feet down to
the rivers level just as soon as you
sight the river turn to your right and
press through the chaparral until you
come to an old dead white oak under
a rock close to this white oak youll
find a gunny sack filled with steel
traps

  if you cant carry all of them at one
trip make two trips spread the traps
over your garden and stake them
down set them and youll not only
save your garden but have young jack-
rabbit for dinner tomorrow

  id set these traps for you myself
but for reasons that i cant explain i
cant do it noiv and anyway the ma-
gician helps those who help them-
selves

  luck to you

the magician

  beyond all doubt the note had this
time at least been placed in the cleft
of the stick after sunup for the ma-
gician could not have seen the devas-
tated melon and cucumber patches
while the dark remained

  and he had underscored youll re-
member youre not going to be here
next year how did he know

  she was distractingly pretty that
morning as she set off after the traps
with the magicians note containing
her instructions she wore her new
high-laced hiking-boots an old felt
hat of her brothers and a short whip-
cord skirt under grapevines and the
sprawling limbs of oaks she followed
the creek road sniffing the odors of

alders and flowering buckeyes all the
way she noticed the evidences of the
recent miraculous flow of the stream
where the creek banks were not com-
posed of stones and boulders as was
usually the case cracking mud show-
ed now and then she encountered
pools where the water had settled

  presently she saw the grim rock that
the note mentioned just ahead she re-
membered it well it was so pictur-
esque with her eyes upon it she did
not notice that there were no longer
any pools of water nor muddy banks
as she passed along but just before
she reached the rock she became aware
of the dryness of the creek bed

  why no water has run here recent-
ly she exclaimed im going back to
find out where the dryness begins
accordingly she retraced her steps
and not far back she encountered
moisture once more with dryness just
above it she crept through brush and
grapevines into the creek bed for a
thorough investigation

  at once she saw a little branch can-
yon that extended into the hills almost
at right angles to the main bed of the
creek this branch watercourse was
moist while the creek bed proper was
dry above it

  it came down that ravine she
said and im going up it-if i can
for two hours she struggled ever up-
ward over outcroppings of stone
creeping under the branches all the
way the bottom of the ravine was
moist and then on the side of a hill
she suddenly encountered a branch of
the branch ravine extending at right
angles to the direction in which she
had been scrambling

  the branch much smaller than the
main ravine was moist while the ra-
vine above it squirming on up the
enchanted ranch



hills was dry as bone

  she was about to turn off and follow
this branch watercourse to its source
when she noted that it did not end at
the ravine an elongated depression
extended from the ravine on the other
side evidently a continuation it was
dry and a thorough examination of it
proved that it was an ancient ditch
line following the contours of the hills
to the west she saw the marks of a
spade where it crossed the ravine

  she stepped to the other side and
followed the moist portion of the ditch
it circled about the hills on a shelf
and every now and then she saw where
it had recently been mended with a
spade or shovel then almost before
she knew it she found herself in a
well defined path and looking down at
the racing water in a great canal

  for a way the small moist ditch fol-
lowed the canal and she followed the
ditch then she came to a weir but
she did not know what it was she rea-
soned however that the mechanism
she saw before her was designed to
check the flow of water in the canal
so that it would rise to the level of a
huge pipe line that she saw on the op-
posite bank when it had risen to the
height of that pipe she thought it
would flow through it to some ranch
on the other side of the ridge in this
instance however everything pointed
toward the belief that the pipe line
had been left closed as it was now
and that the water when checked had
risen and flowed through a man-made
break in the bank of the canal on her
side it had spilled out into the little
ditch and eventually by way of the
little ravine it was delivered to the
dry bed of grapevine creek and thence
to the enchanted ranch

  diantha stood in thought a finger

to her lips then she half whispered
in an awed little voice he stole that
water the magician stoleit from the
big water company and sent it down
to-to me

  up the path a sorrel horse stopped
suddenly as a man reined it in with a
jerk for just a moment cyrus hurley
zanjero for the water company sat in
his saddle looking at the thoughtful
girl and then as softly as possible
he moved his horse into the chaparral
dismounted and stole back on foot to
look again

chapter twelve
traps

        ell the water had
gr been stolen diantha
and duncan had used
it and it could not be
helped

  she turned in the
well-beaten path that
followed the canal and
went the way of the moist ditch to the
ravine once more she ducked under
scrapy branches as she trailed the ra-
vine down to grapevine creek how
could she know that cyrus hurley was
following her her progress made
such noise that the sound of his was
drowned

  she descended to the floor of grape-
vine canyon much swifter than she
had climbed to the canal noon was
still far off as she turned away from
the big rock that overhung the road
and walked up the hill on the other
side on the lookout for the blasted
digger pine

  she discovered it eventually and con-
tinued on until finally a dizzying
slope diopped from her very feet and
she found herself looking over a vast


all western

forest down at the green falcon river
rushing pell-mell to the lower levels
she heard its roar and from around a
sharp bend cut off by innumerable
trees came the rumble of machinery
from where she had been told a gold
dredger was at work

  for a long time she gazed for the
scene was spellbinding then she fol-
lowed directions and entered the chap-
arral to find the dead white oak in
time and the sack of traps cached un-
der an overhanging stone

  she decided after speculation that
she could carry half of them so she
emptied the sack of half its contents
hid the loose traps again and took the
sack containing the remainder upon
her shoulder

  she passed through the chaparral to
the old trail and immediately after she
had started following it toward home
she rounded a brushy bend and found
herself face to face writh hurley

  she stopped alarmed there was an
odd look of deepest interest in the
zanjeros eyes his smile was trium-
phant

  why hello miss stanley he
shouted perhaps too loudly thought
i heard someone cornin along this
trail been gatherin nuts thought
they come only in the fall what on
earth you been doin anyway

  i-i-i found some traps she fal-
tered i-i thoughttheyd be good for
rabbits

  good for rabbits eh ill say they
are but whered ye find em now

  over-over there she pointed be-
hind her

  jest find em layin right out in the
open sack and all

  well not exactly she admitted
they were-sort of under a stone

  he came closer to her she drew

back instinctively she did not like the
look in his eyes at all

  do you know he said that youre
about the prettiest girl i ever met
dianthy

  please call me miss stanley she
corrected but failed to put into her
tone the severity she wanted to com-
mand will you please let me by
she asked i must be getting home
listen he said you folksre
gonta starve down there on the old
john wharton place ye cant make a
livin there girl now i got a good job
with th water company im practical-
ly my own boss and im makin
money on the side i got a good little
ranch that im rentin and maybe ill

growled menacingly

  will you stand one side then so
that i can pass in the trail

  why o course i will i aint goin
to try to force ye to marry me but ill
tell ye right now girl ye better think
it over

  she said nothing but catching her
lower lip with her teeth started to-
ward him with all the bravery that she
could muster he promptly stepped to
one side against the deep hedgelike
wall of the chaparral

  she was greatly frightened she
glanced once into his eyes as she
neared him and the look that she saw
in them she did not like he was stand-
ing very still awkward-looking in his
bigness while she drew near to him
enchanted ranch



the look on his face was one of dog-
like humility as she came abreast of
him she shrank to the other wall of
the chaparral and her legs felt like
running

  then he took two quick steps and
folded her in his arms

  got fooled that time didnt ye
dianthy he leered while she strug-
gled frantically as helpless as a bird
in a trap

  let me go let me go she cried
striking at him with her free hand

  listen he said in a low tone hold-
ing her in one great arm and clamping
the fingers of his other hand about her
wrist i know whose traps ye got in
that sack ye didnt find em exactly
they was cached and i know where-
dost to where anyway ye musta
known nobodys lost em when ye
found em tucked away maybe under
a log or a stone thats stealin di-
anthy up here in th foothills us folks
let other folks things alone when we
find em hid in the woods like this the
fella that owns them traps was trap-
pin in here winter before last hes in

matterll be a secret between you an
i dianthy i aint gonta say nothin

anthy didnt say nothin to ye about

  i did not steal water she flamed

  well maybe big brother was th

one that actually did the trick and it
was pretty smooth too dianthy itd
never occurred to me to try and patch
up that old ditch and carry water
through it to that hidden little ravine
down to grapevine creek and onto
the old john wharton place why that
ditch is fifty year old ill bet dianthy
yere a clever little girl and i -want ye
now what dye say ye wont have to
work like ye do if ye marry me and
well take care o that lazy brother o

  my brother is not lazy she cried
hot with indignation he did not steal

us and my brothers writin  is won-
derful and dont you insinuate that it

went right to em from th crick
how do you know i did she flash-
ed suspiciously

  he only winked at her knowingly
im not such a fool as ye take me for
dianthy how come ye to walk direct
to them traps after ye left grapevine
desperately she searched her mind
for a retort she must not mention the
magician she had promised

  i-i was up here the other day
she lied bravely and saw them but
i couldnt take them then i-i had no
sack so i came for them today-with
a sack thats all

  didnt see ye packin any sack when
ye walked up from th crick

  i-it was rolled up just a small
roll it was i-i was carrying it in my
-my waist

  oh his dark eyes twinkled with
amusement so thats it eh funny
place to pack a sack aint it dianthy


all western

  i dont care if it is i carry sacks
any way i want to are you going to
let me go mr hurley

  not yet he replied complacently
not until you an me has reached an
understandin dianthy

  you were sneaking after me she
accused

  maybe i was an maybe i wasnt
what business have you to do
that

  im lookin out fer th water com-
panys intrests aint i they pay me
to anyway i seen ye up alongside th
main canal and i trailed ye along th
wet ditch down to grapevine then
seein ye climbin up on this side i jest
trailed along to see what ye was up
to

  well if i stole your old water
why should i go to the canal in day-
time and stand there looking at it

  thats what i cant quite make out
so i was lookin into th matter a little
dye know its a serious business to
steal water from a big corporation like
that dianthy

  i didnt steal it i tell you

  o course not it jest rose in th
canal of its own free will spilled over
in th ditch and ran down to your place
and filled th little pool for ye but they
cn put yer brother in jail for it jest

ye can have all th water ye want that
way ill even run her down fer ye my-
self now that yeve showed me how to
do it but ye gotta treat me square i
aint so bad little girl ye cn learn to
love me

  this started her to struggling again
with an unexpected twist she freed
her hand and clawed at his face then
while he was defending himself she
suddenly lowered her head and sank

her teeth into his other wrist

  he did not howl out with pain but
he released his hold on her she darted
forward instantly head down the
traps clanking on her back she had
run not over a half a dozen steps when
his arms went around her again from
behind he pinioned them to her body
laid one broad hand on her forehead
and pressed her head back he drown-
ed her scream of terror with a trium-
phant kiss then freed her and stood
laughing as she stumbled along the
trail with tears streaming down her
face

  remember that water he called
after her i mean business

ing the night the
brother and sister
were awakened by a
great squawking and
a frenzied metallic
clanking in the melon
patch one jack rabbit in steel trap
will make more noise than any carniv-
erous animal in the same predicament
with a few clothes hurriedly thrown
about them they hurried out with a
lantern duncan dispatched the pite-
ously screaming victim while the ten-
der-hearted girl looked the other way

  carrying his warm trophy by the
hind legs duncan started to return
to the cabin but diantha wondering
whether the magician had already
visited the post-office stick turned her
steps in that direction

  yes her note on white paper was
gone and one on yellow paper replaced
it she took it in hand and in the cabin
enchanted ranch



she read by the light of the lantern

  i see you found the traps all right
hope you get the jack that visited you
last night maybe hes the only one that
has discovered your garden but when
the moon is bright again therell be
more of them playing around with
him how fine the garden looks after
its big drink

                faithfully

the magician

  hurley did not come to the en-
chanted ranch for several days and
in the meantime the shallow soil be-
gan to dry out again the plants were
showing signs of wilt then one night
aaron rose stole from the chaparral
to a canyon that ran into grapevine
creek a short way above the ranch
this offered an easier route to the
main canal than diantha had gone in
following the moisture to its source
three-quarters of an hour after lie had
picked up the stanleys shovel aaron
drew cautiously near to the weir and
stopped to listen carefully

  all was silent save for the croaking
of frogs in the watergrass that grew
along the banks of the canal and the
murmuring of the swiftly flowing
water bounding down from the melt-
ing snowlands of the high sierra ne-
vadas aaron stole along the old ditch
line of which the tunnel that he lived
in was a part and used his shovel here
and there to patch up the bank on the
downhill side he reached the place
where he was to take out the water
and ever on the alert started lower-
ing the creaking iron-bound gate to
check the stream then he crossed a
tiny bridge near the gate made sure
that the pine line on the other side was
closed and returned

  the water was rising swiftly cata-

pulting furiously against the broad
obstruction just above it aaron dug
through the top of the bank a ditch
about two feet deep through the loose
earth that he had previously removed
and shoveled back in place again

   the water rose to the level of his
ditch hesitated ran through in a
trickle that steadily gained in volume
until a flow ten inches in diameter was
racing into the old ditch he clambered
down the bank of the canal to the
ditch line and began following it to
see that his earthen patches were hold-
ing the stream then suddenly above
the rush of the water there rang in
his very ear

  hands up stanley

  a black bulk loomed beside him
the voice was hurleys it was very
dark and the zanjero had no way of
knowing that it was not the weak-
hearted science writer with whom he
had to deal

   this is a fine piece o business aint
 it came in the same sarcastic tones
 dont ye savvy ye might as well go
 into a bank and grab a handful o coin
 as to take this companys water

  the dark bulk came closer aaron
made no reply he was waiting for the
critical moment and it was near at
hand

   i warned yer sister the voice went
on but she was so smart she wouldnt
listen to me anyway here ye are
helpin yerself to water agin so  take
it that means shes begun to think a
little what did she tell ye mr stan-
ley did she say i told her ye could
have all the water ye wanted if shed
listen to reason i wanta know tonight
sos ill know how to act

   still no reply

  whats th matter cant ye talk
  there was a sudden leap through ithe


all western

blackness a groan from the zanjero
and a terrific blow on the point of the
jaw sent him reeling backward with
sparks darting before his eyes taken
completely by surprise he was unable
to defend himself against a second
stunning impact and this one deliv-
ered in the same place by aarons
massive fist stretched hurley on the
ground unconscious

  kind of a little surprise party that
one eh cy chuckled aaron as he
lighted a match and bent over his fal-
len enemy how these scientific bugs
can hit when you arent expecting it

i dont know what the outcome of this
will be but i know that the enchant-
ed ranch needs water immediately
the outcome will have to take care of
itself

  he stooped and lifted the big man
on his shoulders into the trees and
brush he carried him and in the thick-
est part he eased him to the ground

 if you know where you are when
you come out of it he said ill be
pretty much surprised the woods will
look all alike to you but ill stay here
half an hour and watch you thats
long enough to fill the pool

  he squatted near his victim on the
alert for signs of recovering conscious-
ness presently hurley began to groan
and throw his arms about but made
no motion to rise

  then aaron had an inspiration and
dragged the big man to a clump of
blackoak suckers he sat him upright
against one of them brought his two
hands around the tree behind him and
tied the wrifcts securely with his big
bandanna handkerchief

  he can yell he said and tomor-
row morning somebody going along
the canal path will hear im

  and with a single peering glance

through the darkness at the great
pyramidal head lopped over on one
shoulder aaron returned to his work

  he heard the zanjero yelling lustily
before he raised the gate and allowed
the water to lower in the canal paying
no attention to the cries for help he
patched up the canal bank hastened
away along the ditch toward grape-
vine canyon

  the pool below the little falls he
found was brimming full of water by
the time that he reached the enchant-
ed ranch he replaced the shovel and
then walked to the post-office stick

  he found a note carried it into the
creek bottom and read it by the light
of a match diantha had had nothing
important to communicate but he
placed the note in his shirt pocket to
be treasured with the others that he
had received from her

  next he took out his slick old gold
watch and opened the hunting-case
with the point of his jackknife he
pried something loose from the inside
of the cover and pocketed the watch
again the round piece of paper that
he had pried from the watch he placed
with the note that he had written
earlier that evening and carried both
to the notched stick where he slipped
them in the slot

 then he crawled back under the
chaparral and sought his cave

  diantha and duncan stanley stood
beside the magic pool which had once
more filled miraculously during the
night just passed in the girls hand
was a note of yellow paper and a round
photograph of a comely-looking wom-
an perhaps twenty-six or twenty-seven
years of age to her brother the girl
read aloud the latest communication
from the magician of the enchanted
ranch
enchanted ranch



dear diantha

  i just thought yesterday to let you
see the photograph of ruth shes my
twin sister and lives in san francisco
i had it in my watch case all along but
never thought that by shoiving it to
you you might get an idea of how i
look ruth and i are very much alike
especially about the nose and eyes and
chin when we were babies they say
they couldnt tell us apart im trusting
you with this place it in the slit in the
stick this evening so that i can get it
tonight you mustnt let anybody see
it

  i notice your pool is full of water
again your little ranch has many con-
veniences to say the least

                  faithfully

the magician

  i like her face immensely decided
diantha after a long space of silence
she has character that woman if
hes anything like her-but he says he
is oh when will we ever know the
answer to this mystery dune

 you seem anxious to know him
observed her brother

  and why shouldnt i be she re-
torted

  after a long period of study he re-
plied lamely i dont know diantha
i guess ill give that one up

  are we going to use this stolen wa-
ter asked the girl her broad brow a
trifle puckered with worry

 why not its here the garden
needs it we cant return it to the wa-
ter company

  she had not told him about cyrus
hurley and her misadventure in the
trail above the falcon river

 i suppose we may as well-now
that its here she agreed but-but
im afraid were going to get into trou-
ble dune

  we cant be in any worse trouble
than we are already he said lightly
ill turn over the engine and start the
pump

 they pumped from the pool until
the water receded below the end of the
suction pipe and once more the garden
flourished shortly after noon they
hooked up knock em dead and drove
up grapevine creek to get the mail

 the country storekeeper at the
three-house village where they bought
supplies and received their mail look-
ed at them with renewed interest to-
day he talked with diantha while
wrapping up her order duncan being
absorbed in a scientific magazine that
had just arrived

   twasnt you folks that held up the
gold messenger from the dredge this
mornin was it he wanted to know

  no such luck laughed the girl
where did it happen tell me about
it

  happened not far from your place
was the reply on top o the ridge
that runs in between you and the fal-
con the dredgers workin up the fal-
con about two miles from you you
know when they make their clean-up
they send out a messenger with the
gold amalgam anywhere from five
thousan to ten thousan dollars is their
usual clean-up the messenger-alf
newberry is his name-takes this
amalgam in pack bags on a burro and
climbs the hill to the top o the ridge
then he follows the ridge parallel
with the river into campbells flat
where the bank takes the stuff and
sends it to the mint hes been held up
once before but they got only about
three thousan dollars and the fella
got away with it

  but that was a holdup what hap-
pened this mornin was a knockout


all western

somebody slipped up behind im as he
was goin along with his six-shooter
in his hand and cracked im in the
back o the head got away with eleven
thousan six hundred dollars worth o
gold alf come to in about half an
hour he thinks and found his burro
browsin off the sage and the pack
bags empty thats about all there is to
tell the sheriff and a big posse are
scourin th country they say th ban-
dit cant possibly get away old john
beebee hes offered fifteen hundred
dollars reward for the capture o the
bandit beebees president o the water
company ye know and is a big stock-
holder in th dredger company on th
side

  the posses mighty keen to nail this
bird and its a hard country to get
out of if a posse gets after a man in
time

  diantha was very thoughtful as she
sat beside her brother still immersed
in his magazine and drove knock em
dead toward home

  was this the answer at last to why
her magician had been hiding in the
hills

chapter fourteen
confession

bout half-past five
that same evening cy-
rus hurley lifted his
head cautiously from
the chaparral on the
northern side of the
old john wharton cab-
in this was not the
first time that he had done so that aft-
ernoon for he and a couple of his
friends had lain in hiding there for
several hours but something of par-
ticular interest was taking place now

  cyrus hurleys face was bandaged
and he had been to the dentist to have
three misplaced teeth attended to this
was the cause of his not being on hand
earlier to get even with the brother
and sister down below and while he
had been at the dentists news of the
holdup came in and he had immedi-
ately drawn his own conclusions

  had it not been for his aching jaw
and dangling teeth he would have
been on the enchanted ranch early
that morning with john beebee to ac-
cuse the stanleys of stealing water
and to prove to the president that they
had done so also he meant to accuse
duncan stanley of assault with a dead-
ly weapon said weapon being a round-
pointed shovel for he reasoned dun-
can in his weak state could have
struck him with nothing else and
wrought such havoc with his facc

  then came the news of the holdup
and changed his plans completely

  lay low boys he said to his
friends the girls doin somethin fun-
ny at last gimme th glasses

  a pair of binoculars was handed to
him and he raised his head higher and
trained them on the little figure cross-
ing the garden toward a stick pro-
truding from the soil when she reach-
ed it she thrust something that looked
like a piece of paper into a crack in
the stick then stood looking up at the
hills that rose about her she turned
and retraced her steps to the cabin
and the white object still remained in
the split stick

  heres somethin interestin at
last hurley excitedly told the others
ever since they come home theyve
done nothin outa the ordinary but
that jane slipped somethin in that
stick in th garden its a signal or a
note or somethin boys that fifteen
enchanted ranch



hundred is ours we got the right dope
now well wait and see what happens

  thats a bad pair fellas he con-
tinued i wonder i didnt get on be-
fore cornin up here an pretendin to
be ranchin it on that miserable piece
o land and him makin out hes an
invalid and cant do any work some
stall ye oughta seen th way that bird
beaned me last night up at th canal
invalid hot dog but i gotta hand it
to em it was a clever stunt and that
amalgams hid somewhere within two
hundred yards of us ill bet theyre
just waitin fer th noise to die down
maybe theyll stick it out here three
months more then suddenly theyll
blow ill bet thats the girls scheme
shes a deep one

  mr hurley sighed heavily and fixed
his eyes on the paper again

 before very long the advancing
night made it almost impossible to see
the little scrap of white against the
opposite hill

  then said hurley this wont do
fellas if somebodys cornin fer that
note hell get it after dark and we
wont know nothin about it im goin
to get her and see what she is while
th gettins good

  so he stole back into the chaparral
made a half circle about the cabin and
came out in the dry creek bed below
the pool he sneaked along the creek
bed until he thought himself abreast
the stick and the paper then cautious-
ly parted the willows and saw that
lights were gleaming in the cabin win-
dows boldly then he stepped out into
the garden but the white paper was
not in the clasp of the stick

  disgusted hurley returned to his
friends and all went home with the
idea of continuing their spying in the
morning

  but on his ranch that night hurley
changed his mind again why not have
done with the entire matter he knew
that diantha had robbed the trap
cache of aaron rose which was not
being done in that locality by the best
citizens he knew that duncan stanley
had stolen water and loosened several
of his teeth in the operation he would
call up old john beebee and the sher-
iff right away and arrange for them to
go with him next morning to the stan-
leys and accuse them of the crime
they would find the gold amalgam
hidden somewhere in the neighbor-
hood and he would receive his fifteen
hundred dollars reward hed show
dianthy that it wasnt healthful to
spurn his offer of love and a home as
she had done hed fix her

  it was very early next morning
when two mounted parties rode onto
the enchanted ranch a dozen or
more men rode in from the south up
grapevine creek as many more with
cyrus hurley at their head rode down
the creek the two posses came to-
gether before the cabin door where
they were confronted by the amazed
owners of the property

  a tall dark gloomy-looking man
touched his black felt hat to the girl
and bowed out one strap of his sus-
penders with a thumb to center atten-
tion on his metal badge

  im jim dunne he announced
sheriff o chaparral county this here
gentleman-he indicated a heavy-set
man-is mr john beebee president
o the water company we come to see
ye about a little matter in fact the
holdup the other day on the ridge be-
tween you folks and the falcon river
know anything about it

  why-why nothing gasped dian-
tha


all western

  beebee spoke in low tones to the
sheriff no use to go at them that
way he said of course theyll deny
it accuse them of stealing the water
been irrigatin lately aint you
drawled the sheriff thought this
crick went dry durin the summer
whered you get yer water

  we pumped it from that pool di-
antha told him since duncan seemed
suddenly to have been rendered
speechless

  uh-huh and howd it get into the
pool

  why it just-just came in there
faltered the bewildered girl

  a loud laugh greeted this

 madam said john beebee pom-
pously we have absolute proof that
you or your brother took water twjce
from our main canal our zanjero has
showed me where it was taken out
and how it was brought to this prop-
erty thats a serious offense and i
have sworn to a warrant for the arrest
of both of you the sheriff has it sher-
iff dunne i demand that you place
these people under arrest

  the sheriff produced a paper if
youll tell me about the holdup now
he said itll go easier with you for
as sure as the district attorney gets
hold o you down to campbells flats
hell get the truth outa you what dye
say

  diantha stood as if in a trance dun-
cans brow was working he seemed
to be trying to apply his scientific rea-
soning to this strange problem and to
arrive at no conclusion

  but before either could respond to
the sheriffs speech a voice drawled at
the corner of the cabin

  just a minute jim im the fella
that did it you do your talkin with
me

  in stupefaction every one there
stared at the gigantic figure of aaron
rose whose face displayed its habitual
good-natured grin

  rose cried the sheriff man
whered ye come from i thought you
was in new york and you say you
done it

  sure drawled rose why not
but-but whatre you doin here
puzzled the sheriff unable to grasp the
situation

  ive been hiding in the hills said
aaron pointing up toward his cave
been there since the night i said i
was goin to new york ill be perfectly
frank with you jim i been layin to
hold up the messenger from the dredg-
er for a long time beebees a heavy
stockholder in that outfit it was the
only way i could see to get damages
out of him for ruinin the rose ranch
while they all stared at him the
sheriff suddenly awoke to his duty
produced a pair of handcuffs dis-
mounted and stepped toward the lover
of roses and persian poetry

  aaron he said i hate to do it
but youve confessed and-

  confessed to what snapped 
aaron drawing back from the cold
steel of the handcuffs

  to holdin up the amalgam messen-
ger from the gold dredge the sheriff
told him

  youre crazy snorted aaron i
said i was layin to hold him up but i
let him go along the ridge time and
time again and never made a move
theres a reason but i aint tellin it
to you fellas he looked significantly
at diantha to find her dark eyes fixed
upon him and sparkling with intensity
what im confessin to he added

is takin the water from the main ca-
nal and bringin it down here to the
enchanted ranch



enchanted ranch

  to which ranch

  to this ranch here rose corrected
himself

  you stole our water cried john
beebee

 and assaulted me with a deadly
weapon chimed in cyrus hurley

  i took my own water said aaron
rose and heres the deadly weapon i
assaulted you with hurley he held
up his enormous right fist and grinned

  what dye mean you took your own
water demanded the president

  why didnt you yourself write me
a letter offerin to give me all the water
i wanted free for five years if id drop
my damage suit asked aaron

  beebees face went red i did he
admitted but i expected you to use it
on your ranch

  you didnt say so in your letter
rose retorted and youll have to ad-
mit that the offer became effective after
i dropped the case

 but-but the way you took it is
highly irregular stammered beebee

  and im a highly irregular guy
aaron told him impudently

  but what about the holdup the
sheriff cut in

  i dont know anything about it
aaron told him didnt know the mes-
senger had been held up till now i
called it off some time ago for reasons
that concern-well me and someone
else

 then if you didnt do it- the
sheriff came to a stop and his eyes
coasted over diantha and duncan
again

  listen said someone whos that
hollerin

  all kept quiet and down the canyon
there floated who-hoo who-hoo

  answer it somebody ordered the

sheriff

  three minutes later a man rode in
on horseback and called

  all off sheriff theyve got the
bird in sacramento he had some of
the stuff on him and hes confessed
said he was the one that held up alf
before

  all right said jim dunne gloom-
ily im goin home

 they all rode through the upper
gate singly and by twos and their
horses breasted the chaparral and dis-
appeared alone on the rickety little
porch stood diantha and duncan stan-
ley and the magician of the en-
chanted ranch

  do i look like my sister asked
aaron

  the dimples showed in dianthas
cheeks i liked her eyes she said
and yours are-are quite like them

  and then she blushed furiously
while her eyes were downcast aaron
bestowed a prodigious wink upon her
brother who looked puzzled a moment
then smiled and went into the cabin

  aaron cleared his throat and grew
very red do you know he asked
why i didnt hold up the messenger

  no she replied why did you
want to and is aaron rose really your
name

  thats it he said and i couldnt
bring myself to the holdup after id
begun workin the magic on the en-
chanted ranch-after id seen you ill
tell you soon why i wanted to pull off
that holdup but i dont want to now
im goin home today and-and i want
you and your brother to go with me

work in where hell be alone and

up old knock em dead right now and

she flashed one swift look into his
earnest blue eyes then turned into the
cabin to tell her brother

a little later knock em dead was
bumping the three of them over the
stones of grapevine creek
