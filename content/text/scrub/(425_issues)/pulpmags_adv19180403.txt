        a change of couriers

f vj hhe blood-red five-pointed stars
emblazoned on the warm yellow
r	bows of the seven birch-bark

        canoes which skirted lake su-
periors north shore advertised the fleet as
a hudsons bay company brigade the
predominancy of james bay crees among
the crews told that the brigade was fresh from
one of the bay posts-in all probability
moose factory and that the route of travel
had been up the moose and missinaibie
rivers across the height of land and down
the michipicoten to the broad and restless
bosom of superior itself

  also the magnificence of the leading canoe
and the elaborate costumes of its occupants
proclaimed it a factors craft a splendid
six-fathom canoe molded sewn and gum-
med by master aborigine hands it glided

lightly as foam under the urge of half a dozen
indian paddlers bowsman steersman two
middlemen paired forward two paired aft

  in the bow fluttered the crimson flag of the
ancient and honorable company from
the stern streamed a long gonfalon of the
same shade crisping and crackling in the wind
and slapping its pennant-like tip with a re-
sounding smack upon the passing wave crests

  from the paddle shafts blew streamers of
gaudy wool and these flying gleams of color
mingled with the glint of bright-beaded moc-
casins red and blue leggings flaming belts
and scarfs brilliant fillets bound about the
black-haired heads carrying still more bril-
liant feathers long graceful plumes dyed in
violent colors which slanted back on the
wearers shoulders and marked them as
trusted canoemen of a factor

  the factor himself a young man com-
pared to the aging priest who shared his
place amidships half sat half reclined upon
a rich robe of snow-white ermine-skin the

adventure

priest was dressed somberly cowled and cas-
socked in black after the fashion of jesuit
missionaries with canvas gauntlets upon his
hands and a mosquito veil covering his face
but rich as the robe they both reclined upon
was the young mans every garment fastid-
ious distinctive elegant at once suiting a
personality of superior tastes and fitting his
rank as an overlord of the mighty company

  upon abnormally heavy shoulders he wore
a blanket-cloth coat of a rare fawn color

  across his wide chest the coat was thrown
open to the sweeping lake breeze and under-
neath a low-collared shirt of fine flannel
also unbuttoned fluttered and crinkled and
bellied revealing his huge deltoids and the
great muscled ridges extending from neck to
shoulder his lower limbs were clothed in
short trousers of creamy deerskin tanned
soft and pliable as chamois and meeting sum-
mer moccasins of the same material high-cut
above the calf like winter shoe-packs

  a massive frame he possessed and possessed
it proudly rugged like the neck was the head
that rose above it the clean-shaven well-
rounded jaw hollowed above the chin the
mouth full and firm nose straight and spa-
ciously nostriled for the big lungs cheek-
bones high and well-fleshed hollowing the
face again in front of the small close-set ears

  hair short-cropped and clean of scalp his
head was covered with a cap of soft amber
leather the visor peak of which shaded his
gray eyes from the sun calm self-reliant
determined yet with the flash of the youthful
spirit in them tempered by a wealth of ex-
perience the eyes looked ahead over su-
periors rollers toward the rock-ramparted
spruce-sentineled shore and his voice when
he spoke belied nothing of the masterfulness
of his frame his face or his eye

  it was a deep voice strong and resonant
thrilling with a peculiar timbre which be-
trayed the fact that he was accustomed to
read aloud from books or perhaps make
oration to gatherings of traders and tribes
it was the voice of one in authority one who
supremely commands decrees the law

  look father andrews he exulted ex-
tending a powerful brown mobile hand
yonder is our island it hides the bay be-
hind eugene drummond will meet us in
grande portage to-night and to-morrow we
shall be well  our way to our new district

  but are you sure your voyageur will not
fail you carlisle hazarded father andrews

  eugene never fails me declared carlisle

with a shake of his head last fall when i
got news of my transfer this summer from
moose factory to cumberland house and
sent him in to spy out the land  gave him
especial warning to be at grande portage
not later than july the ninth  told him 
would reach there today the ninth on my
way to cumberland house and he was
under orders to lead the brigade on no he
will not fail

  with a swing of his body he twisted his
head and nodded to his ojibway steersman

  the channel missowa he directed in
the ojibway dialect

  ae factor returned missowa who was
standing up to his work in the high-curved
stern and in a different guttural lone he
added the laconic word-canoe

  so demanded carlisle sitting erect to
stare under his hand maybe its the iro-
quois indian who passed without seeing us as
we ate dinner down the shore

  no iroquois decided the ojibway steers-
man no indian white man a man of
the french company

 a northwest fur company man eh
yes missowa yes-i believe you are right
for now he saw it was indeed the north-
west fur companys livery that the approach-
ing paddler wore a northwest canoe he
paddled out through the molten wash of gold
that the westering sun spilled over the high
wooded mainland ridge where the pigeon
river brawled down to superior

  like a northwest voyageur passing out of
grande portage bay upon the customary
evening fishing excursion the canoeman drift-
ed his slender paddle stirring the golden wash
and gilding itself therein his glistening yellow
craft slanting like a shaft of sunshine from
roller crest to roller trough and back again

  but once outside the channel where the
tree-crowned island which hid the bay
screened him from sight of any one on shore
carlisle noted a change in his attitude
from the casual pose of a fisherman he sud-
denly threw himself into the pose of one who
runs a race and paddling viciously bore like
a surf-rider down upon the factors craft

  every time he retrieved his paddle after
the plunge he caused it to touch the lake sur-
face with a vicious forward poke which sent
the spray spattering like shot against his
canoe bow where the letters n w were
smeared in black pitch the smear seemed
to annoy him and at every splash the factor
could hear him growl low in his throat
ambush





  certainement he reiterated i change
you soon i change you soon

twenty feet away and still
in mid-career he whirled his prow
with one flick of his paddle on to the
nose of a cross-sea and there he poised spec-
tacularly balancing with superb skill the
while he threw the tasseled cap from his head
into the canoe-bottom and followed it with
the red shirt stripped from his tody naked
to the waist around which buckskin trousers
were loosely belted he stood silhouetted
against the flaming disk of the sun his short
squat powerful body tanned to a smoky
bronze shining dull-red

  all the time his expressive hands gesticu-
lated his volatile face tanned like his
body creased itself in a cunning grin so that
the milk-white teeth gleamed the thin nos-
trils quivered the cold-black eyes danced
the grin became a chuckle and he tossed his
head from side to side streaming his raven
hair this way and that in wild disorder on the
whistling wind

  eh wat you tink camarades he salut-
ed as he stamped upon the discarded shirt

  drummond ejaculated carlisle and
missowa in one breath

  oui laughed the voyageur an glad to
be rid of dat disguise once i scrape dat
diable pitch off ma bows an paint dem wit
de crimson star i feel happy again
carlisle glanced aside at the priest with a
quiet smile of vindication

  i told you father that eugene would
not fail me he reminded

  aye paul nodded andrews and may
all your subjects always be as faithful

  the factor turned back to eugene drum-
mond

  but why did you not wait in grande
portage as i ordered he demanded why
are you in that disguise and why have you
come down the lake to meet me

  de norwestaires close grande portage
announced drummond with a dramatic
sweep of his arm nobody goes troo-
hudsons bay men free-traders nor any-
body else

  something like an imprecation rumbled in
carlisles throat a wave of anger suffused
and darkened the sun-bronze of his face and
his gray eyes widened glinting hard

  they would try that he blurted in a
voice so heavy that it was almost a bellow
they would dare

  dey have dared assured the voyageur
dey claim her as norwest ground ba
gar factor dis beeg fight dat treatens so
long shes come at last all troo de sas-
katchewan were you sent me spyin i be see
de signs

  what about our trade on the saskatche-
wan now

  its wan long report an im have to
geeve you de figures ashore but to spik her
brief im find de norwestaires be winnin
our trade oui and deres anodder winnin
more dan us or de norwestaires

  a free-trader eh

  certainement wan american frontiers-
man named ralph wayne

  the six-fathom canoe gave a violent lurch
father andrews had started suddenly and
even as carlisle gazed at him in mild surprise
the priest viciously smote the palm of his
left gauntlet down the back of his right

  a mosquito under your glove eh father
the factor bantered angry gravity disap-
pearing from his face under the impulse of
whimsical laughter it takes more than
canvas to stop those whining bloodsuckers
the priest answered nothing but while he
rubbed his hand eugene drummond gazed
keenly at him across the twenty-foot water
gap for andrews had been a mystery to
drummond ever since the first time he had
set eyes on him that was twenty-one
years before when the priest had drifted up
lake huron into fort michillimackinac in
charge of the nine-year-old boy paul carlisle
the boys father so andrews gave it out was
an english officer captain charles carlisle
of butlers rangers stationed at niagara
who had been killed in butlers raid upon the
wyoming valley and who being a widower
had left the boy in his charge

  that was all eugene drummond knew
of the history of either of the two and the
passing of twenty-one years had not increased
his knowledge very much true he had seen
young paul schooled given entrance as a clerk
into the service of the great company advanc-
ed little by little transferred for a period to
england where he managed the london fur
sales and at the same time dipped into the
higher learning and finally made factor of
the important james bay post of moose
factory whence he was now moved to be lord
of cumberland house on the saskatchewan

  although andrews was his companion and
guardian through it all and eugene drum-
mond was in almost constant contact with


adventure

them in the hudsons bay companys ser-
vice the voyageur had never solved the
intangible mystery that he fancied surrounded
the priest never in those twenty-one years
had drummond fairly seen the man andrews
his figure or his face

 always he looked upon a gown that
seemed to him to shroud and to conceal upon
head-gear that was something of a mask
now in summer it was the heavy dun cowl
and the thick mosquito veil in winter it
was the dun cowl and a fur-fringed helmet-
like hood on his capote that proved just as
impenetrable

  drummond always imagined that if an-
drews but dropped the mask his mystery
would dissolve and the suspended possibility
continually fretted and irritated him mon
dieu why could not the man be human like
the rest of these large-thewed tangible
northmen he was tired of watching an
elusive ghost flitting about in a black gown
and why le tdiable had andrews started and
lurched the canoe just now

  was it because of a mosquito-bite or was
it because he eugene had voiced the name
of ralph wayne the voyageur determined
to watch and see but as he went on to speak
further of the free-trader his shrewd dark
eyes could read nothing for the priest now
sat impassive still rubbing lightly the thumb
of his left gauntlet along the back of his right

  dis man wayne is de great powaire in
dat west elucidated eugene an he be
built wan stronghold fort wayne to defend
hees district he be de mightiest of de in-
dependents de leader of dem all an he be
de enemy as mooch as de norwestaires dat
we have to fight an absorb

  carlisle listening nodded ponderously his
face clouded his forehead ridged in a frown
as if he weighed the voyageurs news within
liimself and found it of heavy portent his
nod was a sign of complete understanding and
an intimation for eugene to go on

  so as well as to warn you about grande
portage bein closed i be come out to tell you
of dis man wayne he be beeg menace to
de norwestaires joost lak us an deyre
goin to light an absorb heem-queeck

  how quick demanded the factor

  dis night i sign on wit de norwest-
aires an wear deir clothes to get de infor-
mation an im come down from de west
wit wan lake wimiipeg brigade we pass
wayne dis mornin on de pigeon river he
be on hees way to montreal wit hees sea-

daughter joan wayne be travelin wit
heem to montreal an de norwest partners
goin seize her along wit her father wan
of de partners has hees eye on her dis long
taim so dey tell me in de post

  which partner carlisles words slipped
forth sharp as slitting steel

  richelieu

  then this things serious eugene
declared the factor and it means that you
and i have to get into grande portage this
afternoon we must meet waynes brigade
at the other end of the portage and warn him
and his daughter we must do il for trade
and other reasons you have your disguise
all ready well go ashore and fashion
mine

  ba gar cried drummond with a gri-
mace im tink im done wit dose diablc
trappings but shes de good cause an in de
good cause im glad to wear dem leetle
longaire an you factor im tink mebbe
you pick wan off de lake

  he pointed straight down the north
shore

  you see wan iroquois indian paddle in
to grande portage dis afternoon ver
well dats de guide of de montreal mail
canoe de courier send heem ahead de
last few miles to report de mail coinin
an im know shes coinin soon for yon-
daires paddles flashin lak loons wings off
de temple rock

the hudsons bay brigade lay
fairly in the sun glare streaming like
a path of gold across the heaving lake
swells the sun itself was at their backs as
they all stared in the indicated direction
and they could see without being readily
seen

  by heavens youre right exclaimed
carlisle it surely is the montreal canoe
i take your hint drummond it is as the
courier i shall go in missowa command-
ing the ojibway steersman lie in the
shelter of yon small island we can not be
seen there and there it does not matter to
us whether the northwester takes the inside
or the outside passage eugene fall in with
the other craft behind

  at a spoken word from missowa the port
ambush



paddlers dipped a strong forward stroke
the starboard paddlers hung with a back-
water stroke as strong the factors craft
swung in a choppy half-circle and slanted off
for the lee of the island round the bouldered
point where the big rollers broke in a white
smother drummond turning in behind
with the six smaller canoes greeted the
motley crowd which filled them four men
to each craft with a knowing grin

  james bay crees the indians were to-
gether with ojibways and an occasional
chippewa all trusted post runners and
trippers of the company and all personally
known to the voyageur known likewise
were the white men hampton the younger
son of an english squire jarvis the street
arab picked up from the pavements of lon-
don and in the service as a clerk wells the
country youth from a south-of-england
shire garry and lea the two hardy scots
from inverness and cromarty and the hardier
highlander lewis from the savage hebrides

  although eugene had not seen any of them
for nearly eight months he recognized every
member of the brigade at a glance greatly
his volatile nature longed to hail each by
his familiar name and pass with each a fitting
and peculiar jest but the montreal canoe
was approaching and silence was the order
from carlisle

  not long had they to lie in ambush behind
the concealing island presently arose a
sound of water thrown from a pail upon the
lake surface in spaced gushes-the splash of
careless paddles

  line them out missowa carlisle com-
manded in a whisper

  like magic the eight canoes slipped from
concealment and bow to stem throughout
the line totally barred the channel passage
which the northwest courier was taking for
smoother water his two iroquois canoe-
men brought up the craft suddenly with
bending paddle shafts and foaming blades
while the courier himself a swarthy-skinned
frenchman half arose in amazement from
amidships either hand upon the gunwales

  i am bertand northwest mail courier
from montreal he began in french and
you are-

  of hudsons bay as you see smiled
carlisle answering him in his own tongue

 and you want  

  your letters your clothes and your
canoe the letters will go on safely to
grande portage your clothes and canoe

the same or better will be returned to you
meanwhile you test quietly on shore here
do you agree

  the couriers eyes ran over the line and
he shrugged his shoulders in resignation

  but yeshe agreed because i am no
fool especially in the face of superior num-
bers

  very well nodded carlisle and waved
the northwesters indian paddlers inshore

  eugene he directed put on your shirt
and cap and slip back as you came it is
best for us to go in separately and besides
i leave it to you to get the iroquois guide
who arrived this afternoon out of my way
when i come do it any way you can but
be sure to get rid of him short of bludgeon-
ing him ill waste no time other than to
arrive at a decent interval after you

  and i eugene put in father andrews
abruptly shall drift in alone a little ahead
of paul

  taken unawares the voyageur exclaimed
loudly in his french tongue and darted
andrews another of those sharp wondering
looks with which he was wont to regard the
priest par dieu here was that mystery
again what le diable he demanded of
himself did a priest want in mixing in such
affairs

  and even carlisle regarded andrews with
grave astonishment

  you had better not risk it father he
advised you know there will be danger
in the business

  for you admitted andrews but not
for me why should the northwesters
bother their heads about a lone priest
does my breed not watch at birth of north-
westers and hudsons bay men alike min-
ister to their living needs alike and bury
them alike at death i shall surely go for
i have in mind what eugene said about the
girl

adventure

canvas leather-bound mail-sack between
his knees as the craft rounded the island
which screened grande portage bay

  their own brilliant and picturesque cos-
tumes discarded for the drab gear of the
iroquois canoemen missowa the ojibway
steersman and waseyawin the cree bows-
man stoically paddled him in with their short
quick strokes the canoe nosed into the
channel a mile and one-quarter wide and
the wilderness post broke suddenly upon his
vision

  on his left hand lay the sheltering island
with its rubble of great gnarled boulders
littering the beach its long sloping point
sheering up and its rampart of bush stand-
ing solid above on his right spread the
amphitheater of the bay a crescent sweep of
shallow water delicate green in color and
clear as air edged by a low flat shore which
was backed in turn by terraced laurentian
hills

  tier upon tier they rose the lowest three
hundred feet in height the highest over one
thousand covered with crowding forest of
birch and spruce and pine thrusting out
virgin arms to embrace the lesser island

  walling the back of the level shore land
and curving westward into the lake rose a
natural barrier a forty-foot cliff of rock
along the eastern side foamed a small
stream and hard by the stream the post
buildings crouched in the clearing under
the first hill tier they huddled surrounded
by cedar palisades eighteen feet in height

  tent villages and indian cabins spiraled
with the smoke of many fires dotted the
eastern bank of the stream while on the
meadows and terraces farther back grazed
cattle brought up the lakes in large boats
or driven overland by wood trails from st
paul on the mississippi

  over the bouldered channel-bottom dis-
tinctly seen through the intensely clear
water over the pebbled reach farther in-
shore carlisles craft drove straight for a
long canoe pier whereon he glimpsed many
men at work loading or unloading canoes
as he approached he noted that the pier was
built so as to form a canoe harbor fash-
ioned of great square-timbered crib-work
spiked with iron its foundation heavily
stone-weighted to hold it in the bay it
was formed by two arms

  the long western arm or shoreway streaked
out from the curving sand beach into
the bay meeting at an angle the short

eastern or harbor arm which extended but
half-way back to land thus with only
a narrow water gate for entrance was en-
closed a canoe harbor which was safe for
fragile crafts in any storm

  though only a slight swell disturbed the
channel outside the harbor inside was
calmer still it lay like a mill-pond parting
to carlisles rippling bows as he passed the
fur sloop otter lashed to the pier just out-
side the water and the arm of the pier it-
self his eyes following the curving bilge of
the sloop from water-line to keel and marking
the bottom-most timbers of the crib-work
weed-grown in the clear green depths who
had built the old pier he did not know for
here he touched upon ancient ground

  perhaps he thought it was the wanderer
dulhut who first of all established grande
portage post in  perhaps it was the
later adventurer lanove who rebuilt dul-
huts post in  or again it might have
been any one of the swarm of french and
scotch traders who after the fall of quebec
to the english in  pushed their trading
places along the great lakes to detroit
michillimackinac the sault the kamin-
istiquia river and finally to grande portage
at the mouth of the pigeon

  later and before carlisle was born
english traders foregathered there and a
score of fur lords competed bickered and
fought to finally amalgamate into the north-
west fur company with the avowed inten-
tion of slowly but surely sweeping the
hudsons bay company from the continent
how well the northwesters were succeed-
ing in this his own generation carlisle
realized wasknown only to a few like him-
self who occupied high posts in the service
and his whole being thrilled at the trust
imposed on this few by the older corporation
when it commissioned them to throw down
the gage of decisive battle

  no ordinary routine incident was his
transfer from moose factory to cumber-
land house but the first move in a mighty
struggle which could mean for his company
only one of two things conquest or cession
and how desperate must be that struggle
was borne in upon him by the plain truth
that here at the very outset he was setting
foot into a stronghold of his enemies almost
single-handed 

  enemies his gray eyes lightened with
the anticipative gleam of conflict but
abruptly came remembrance of the courier
ambush



rsle he had assumed and he motioned his
two pseudo iroquois canoemen to work him
in against the crib

  a pause in the toil and a shout from the
toilers greeted him all along the pier
within reach of his hand were tied the big
rabiscaw freight canoes from montreal and
the men who worked them through the
ottawa and french rivers and the lake
route to grande portage were the ones un-
loading the cargoes they had brought
arms and ammunition knives axes blan-
kets cottons from the looms of far man-
chester gaudy handkerchiefs of silk and
cotton rope and twine fishing nets and
lines copper kettles and other cooking uten-
sils beads and mirrors kegs of rum car-
rot tobacco twist tobacco tea flour sugar
-articles of food and trade in endless variety

  and the men themselves carlisle recog-
nized as the giant pork eaters famed on the
trail french voyageurs off the ottawa river
and the parishes around iroquois indians
caughnawaga indians fierce untamed
they yelled shrilly the white men dancing
joyously at the arrival of the mail but
carlisle gave no answer other than to shake
the pouch suggestively as his canoe glided
close in at the end of the shoreway there
he leaped out and his two canoeman stalk-
ing at his back strode across the flat and
in through the open gate of the palisade
leaving missowa and waseyawin in the
yard he went on to the main warehouse
where he knew he would find the post-
keeper in charge

  with his blood leaping in his body he
stepped over the threshold for he knew also
whom he would see sitting there if his
disguise deceived david thompson he was
safe to go where he willed in grande portage

  he had full confidence in his masquerade
but at the same time the knowledge that
this was a critical test keyed him to severest
tension poised his physical being for a dash
to escape if his confidence should not be
instantly justified he carried the mail-
sack on his shoulder as he passed between the
door-jambs shooting a glance under the sack
and his curved arm seeking out the keeper

at sight of a little office railed off
from the general warehouse car-
lisles fibers thrilled again for be-
hind it he beheld thompson as ever astron-
omer and explorer rather than fur-trader
poring over his maps and plans

  at the swish of the couriers moccasins he
looked up

  ha art here then he nodded hiswelsh
origin betraying itself in his speech tuh
guide reported ee some hours ago put thy
sack down there whilst make tuh entry

  as thompson drew forward the journal
of the post carlisle silently expelled a deep
breath thompson had passed him thomp-
son who for thirteen years had served in
the hudsons bay company with him who
had lived the routine post life or taken the
far trail with him thompson with whom
he had built manchester house and win-
tered among the indians and sojourned at
samuel heames old post cumberland
house which was now to be his own

 thompson with whom he had parted
regretfully when on being ordered by colen
factor at york factory to do less survey-
ing and get more trade returns thompson
had left the service in a heat and gone
over to the northwest company to under-
take a journey of discovery that shamed
colen and all the hudsons bay how
carlisle envied him and his new company
that feat-the survey west from grande
portage to lakes winnipeg and winnipe-
gosis south on the assiniboine to the souris
across the plains to the mandan villages
on the missouri thence to the assiniboine
again down to the red river across to the
mississippis headwaters northwest to du-
luth on lake superior round superiors
shore-line to the sault and home once more
to grande portage

  four thousand miles of virgin wilderness
mapped in ten months and to be fur-farmed
on the basis of the mapping by the north-
westers the magnitude of it was astound-
ing the attendant loss to the hudsons bay
company colossal holding his companys
honor as he held his own it hurt carlisle
keenly to think that his former friend and
the companys former servant had been
the cause

  but of carlisles state of feeling thomp-
son realized nothing it was to his mind
the montreal mail-courier who stood be-
fore him and he dipped his pen in the pot of
brown ink carlisle leaning sidewise
against the grill his elbow on the mail-
pouch so that his big arm hid most of his
face waited with a renewal of his trepida-
tion the other entries of the journal written
in the fine cramped hand he knew so well
dancing before his eyes but in a moment


adventure

thompson finished recording the mail-
couriers arrival and closed the book

  art free now he announced thou
wilt rest four days then ee wilt start back
for montreal

  carlisle flopped his battered hat-brim
in a nod of comprehension swung on his
moccasined heels and passed out without a
word to where missowa and waseyawin
awaited him

  the order is to start back for montreal
in four days he informed them with a
grim smile in the meantime we are free
to amuse ourselves

  good grunted waseyawin in cree
it is well for us to have that knowledge if
any man should ask

  yes nodded carlisle and now we
must get over the portage as fast as we
can have you seen eug- ha yonders
his red shirt at the gateway come and
well see how things stand

  carlisle and drummond met casually
outside the palisade exchanging brief
greetings and passing the news of the trail
after the custom of northmen meeting as
strangers then still talking carelessly
strolled off up the path which led to port
charlotte on the pigeons bank

  not till they were completely out of sight
of the post did they drop their careless pose
and not till then did the cree and the ojib-
way who had been loitering behind presume
to catch up with them

  what about the iroquois guide car-
lisle demanded abruptly of drummond

  he be served wit extra rum for hees
news of the mail cornin an im see dat
he get lee tie more wen i come back
chuckled eugene mon dieu-dancin
drunk-aint trouble you

  and father andrews

  he be gone on ahead informed eugene
he ver mooch afraid you be delayed some-
how at de post an he tink in dat case it
best for heem to go on to meet dem

  then let us hurry up and join him
exclaimed carlisle feverishly i want to
be there when wayne and his girl arrive
you lead off eugene

  with the woodsmans lope swift though
easy the lope that never tires never varies
drummond led off carlisle at his heels the
two indians swaying lithely in the rear
the portage was nine miles in all and for
the first half-dozen miles they climbed a
stiff grade dropping into hundred-foot

gulches and clambering out again fording
small creeks or thumping over them on
roughly timbered bridges threading swampy
beaver meadows on paths of corduroy

  then they topped the loftiest ridge
whence the land rolled down in gentle con-
volutions to the brink of the river three
miles away through the heart of a mag-
nificent pinery speckled here and there
along the creeks with birch and poplar
carlisle and his companions ran upon a
trail the like of which was not to be found
upon the continent it was the connecting
route between the great lakes and the vast
west beyond

  below port charlotte the pigeon river
ran wild plunging in great cascades un-
navigable by even the hardiest voyageurs
there was no following it to its mouth so
brigades from the west unloaded here and
packed over the nine-mile carry to grande
portage on superiors open water

  every bale of fur gathered by the north-
westers in that gigantic wilderness from
lake superior on the east to the pacific on
the west from the mississippis headwaters
on the south to the arctic ocean on the
north was freighted here by the northmens
canoes and carried across on their backs
likewise all the supplies for that immensity
of river lake forest mountain plain and
barren every pound of food and article of
trade brought to grande portage by the
rabiscaw canoes of montreal went across
in the opposite direction upon the same
muscled backs

  all along the rugged twisting trail car-
lisle and the others met or passed them in
the act huge northmen from the pays
den haut pork eaters caughnawagas and
iroquois from the ottawa monstrously
back-laden working in the pack-straps in
relays setting down their burdens every
thousand yards and breathing themselves as
they retraced their steps for more

  packing for the glory of the packer and
a spanish dollar a hundred pounds they
sweated and toiled coming and going dot-
ting the up grade and the down and hiving
thickly round the port charlotte landing
where carlisle and his three men came out
on the river

  ba gar we be none too soon panted
drummond in a low voice yondaires
ralph waynes brigade

  he pointed toward the mid-current of
the pigeon and carlisle glimpsed half a
ambush

ii

dozen canoes swerving in for the landing

  and theres father andrews close by the
waters edge exclaimed carlisle slow
down to a walk and scatter out a little
and wed better take packs as we go
load up with anything handy and drop
where  drop mine

      from the spot where the last relay
had deposited the loads bound west-
ward over the portage they took up
bundles and sacks of provisions and bent
under them as if they were regular burden
bearers shuffled down through the crowd of
northwesters on the river bank carlisle
dropped his pack directly behind the priest
and the others following suit they all
straightened up stretching their arms in
the air pretending to breathe themselves
as they idly watched the incoming brigade

   were here father carlisle whispered at
andrewss back and so is the free-trader
i see are you going to tell him or shall i
i must paul returned andrews in a
voice of intense gravity it may seem
strange to you but neither wayne nor his
daughter must know your real name-yet
you may wonder but i tell you in all faith
it must be so it is important-more it is
vital to your interests and waynes as well
i must be to him a courier that is
for the present

  yes you believe me when i say it is
imperative

  of course father you know i have
faith in your slightest word

  all right let me do the talking the
canoes are almost in

  the prow of the foremost craft all but
grazed the landing then swung broadside
in to it under skilful paddle-strokes from
amidships a man of fifty-five or so clad in
buckskin garments unornamented except
for the customary fringes stepped cleanly
out upon the shore carlisle scrutinizing
him eagerly was struck by his great height
although the hudsons bay factor himself
stood fully six feet this man topped him
by four inches and the impression of height
was intensified by his lanky erectness

  clean-flanked sloping-shouldered long-
armed he seemed to poise in the air rather
than to stand upon his battered moccasins
his head was bare and from it the brown
hair luxuriant in spite of his advancing
years ran down in waves and curls almost
to his shoulders his face was darkened by

exposure to a mahogany shade in which the
only high lights that showed were the golden
flash of odd-colored eyes eyes between a
fawn and a green hue and the sheen of the
copper-colored mustache which swept down
in long heavy curves over the grim mouth

   every inch a frontiersman carlisle sensed
about him that greatness of spirit which
ineffaceably dings to those who have dared
the wilderness in all its immensity all its
ruthlessness all its cruelty who have dared
it and conquered and inevitably in the con-
quering brought the depths of their natures
to the surface even while carlisle swiftly
appraised him he stooped with agility one
hand on the canoe gunwale the other held
toward his daughter to steady her as she
disembarked

  out upon the landing she leaped beside
him and although her head scarcely reached
to his shoulder carlisle recognized in her
swelling-hipped full-bosomed figure the
erect agile supple poise of her father
it showed in the curve and grace of her
ankles and calves encased in elk-skin moc-
casins and revealed by the short gray wool
canoe skirt she wore it showed too in the
straight arms whose swell of forearm and
upper arm but enhanced the direct line of
her limbs

  but her looks he knew she must have
inherited from her mother for here was no
skin of swarthy shade or mahogany tan
fair as northland snows was the face re-
vealed as she threw back the veil of mos-
quito netting round her head indeed so
pallid shone her complexion in contrast
with her fathers that it seemed to be wanly
bleached and her hair yellow wheaten
and spun-gold all in one-like the mingling
hues of birchen leaves in autumn-seemed
against his brown hanging curls to be like-
wise bleached

  but carlisle was aware that the art of
bleaching did not extend north to latitude
fifty-four and besides the glow and sheen
of both skin and hair told that they were
natural as natural as the lake-blue laughing
eyes or the spray of crimson which tinged
her cheeks at either side of the delicately
chiseled nose

grande portage at last
father she exclaimed laughing so
that her red lips parted whimsically
poutingly over splendid teeth it is good
to get the canoe cramps out


adventure

  yes joan nodded her father a smile
cracking the grim mohogany of his face
its been a long day but heres a nine-
mile walk to stretch your legs

  youve come far then i take it put
in father andrews rising from the bundle
upon which he sat and extending his hand
to the frontiersman

  from fort wayne on sturgeon lake
replied the other returning his grip im
ralph wayne the free-trader and this is
my daugher joan were bound to mon-
treal and you i see by your netting have
followed the mosquito-pestered trail too
where are you bound father

  but here responded the priest turning
his head to see that none of the north-
westers were in hearing and speaking in a
lower voice i am father andrews and
ive come with a warning richelieu and
his partners have closed the portage as
private ground they will seize you at the
post the partners want your trade i
understand and richelieu-well with a
nod aside at joan richelieu wants some-
thing else

  into the fawn-green eyes in the mahogany
gloom of waynes face blazed a light like the
flare of lightning in a murky cloud in-
stinctively his hand fell upon joans arm in
a protecting gesture his tall frame straight-
ened another inch and his sweeping mus-
taches began to quiver as a precursor of
violent speech

  but andrews was quick to forestall him
be careful the priest warned hurriedly
be very careful these northwesters all
know what is going to happen to you but
dont precipitate it by letting them know
that you know is there any chance of
your getting back up the pigeon by a swift
dash now are there any of their fleets
afloat

  two of their winnipegosis brigades
behind me rasped wayne in a voice
virulent with bitterness and rage if
things are as you say theyll be notified
too theres no chance to pass them
then there is nothing left to do but try
for escape at the superior end decided
andrews you wont be able to count on
your own men since theyll be watched or
overpowered but you may count on me and
these four behind me the courier the voya-
geur and the two indians trust them as
you would me

  thank god for your kindness and your

warning father breathed wayne turning
in the middle of his words as if from some
trivial conversation to loudly order his men
to lift the canoes and adjust the fur bales in
tump lines for packing over to grande por-
tage thank god for it i say on account
of my girl if we can manage to get her
safely through for the rest i do not care
but i do father declared joan in a
tremulous voice if i get through you
must too otherwise i dont want to

  and as the white men of waynes brigade
men of the mississippi men of the missouri
men of the red-independent-spirited ad-
venturers like himself-together with his
crees and chippewayans shuffled off under
their burdens of canoes and furs on the up-
grade from port charlotte the girl flashed
a glance at the four whom father andrews
had named as to be trusted

  tell me she urged intensely with the
painful desire of one who will know the
worst is there any real chance of getting
through

  her beseeching eyes went past drum-
mond past missowa and waseyawin as
if the magnetic personality of carlisle hid-
den though it was drew them to himself
and for the first time since he had assumed
the couriers disguise the factor silently
cursed his masquerade

  by heavens yes a real chance he
swore fervently for rather than see harm
come to you i myself will sheathe a knife
in richelieus heart

chapter iii

an interrupted marriage sacrament

carlisle and his men running empty-
handed had loped over the portage in a
little better than an hour but it was more
than a two-hours walk back for the laden
brigade and the laggard summer dark came
down as they neared the post all the way
across the two groups had kept well sepa-
rated so as not to invite the notice or arouse
the suspicions of the trooping northwesters
who at the end of their days work were
flocking back to grande portage and in the
ordinary routine of superintending the pack-
ing ralph wayne had managed to let each
member of his brigade know what to expect

  that no northwester attempted to mo-
lest them yet or even speak to them further
than to pass the customary greetings of the
ambush



trail did not make them any easier in mind
for it was plain that throughout every mile
of the nine they were unostentatiously kept
under vigilance one large body straggled
ahead of them one behind them upon the
winding path and when they reached the
square of the palisades they became aware
that there were crowds of men as a pre-
ventive of flight between them and the
open beach

  instinctively the two groups which policy
had kept separate now united against a
common menace carlisle gradually worked
his way to the head of the line close to
joan wayne while eugene drummond
missowa and waseyawin glided silently at
his back hard at their heels came the
free-trader and the priest themselves
trailed by the thirty-odd brigade men
bunching together under their packs of fur

  as they passed into the stockade a ribald
clamor greeted them sounds of men singing
and shouting and roaring with laughter all
sharply punctuated by the explosive pop-
ping of corks and the crash of a shattered
wine-glass on hard boards the babel rose
from a big residence building which they
were skirting and as carlisle the girl and
the rest came into line with its row of open
lighted windows the brilliant scene within
the dark-walled building flashed vividly
upon their eyes

  under flaring hanging lamps round many
feasting tables spread up and down the long
hall were gathered together one hundred or
more officers of the northwest company
interpreters guides clerks wintering part-
ners from the west meeting here the execu-
tive partners from the east the most ag-
gressive of the thirty-five lords of beaver
hall

  among the rows of faces carlisle glimpsed
many known to him macgillivray and
sager from fond du lac todd from fort des
prairies james mckenzie grant mctav-
ish and mcleod from english river and
the athabasca mckay from the swamp
country roderick mckenzie and the rest
of his cronies from montreal and lastly
simon richelieu black-bearded of face ram-
rod-like of figure resplendent in the uniform
of a french colonel reckless voluble ad-
dressing half a dozen different persons at
the same moment

  there they sat noisily devouring such
epicurean marvels as bisons hump mooses
nose beavers tail wassailing in the finest

italian french and spanish wines and
flinging their souls out in laughter and song
but even as those outside gazed and passed
the windows the clamor stilled with strange
abruptness it was evident that a mes-
senger had entered and spoken that waynes
unostentatious warders upon the portage
had communicated with their roistering
overlords the company rose in a body
and simon richelieu in the lead poured out
upon the steps and sand terrace of the
building

  richelieu stood upon the outer step the
lamplight falling upon his gay uniform
laughing like a sardonic devil in his black
beard and bowing his ramrod body from the
hips

  welcome ralph wayne he chuckled
welcome mademoiselle joan the sup-
per is ready mon dim but i thought you
were never coming

  the devil exclaimed wayne startled
in spite of forewarning what does this
pleasantry mean

  ill tell you spat richelieu the iron in
him showing up through his levity as he
shoved his brutal domineering face into
waynes ill tell you ralph  for sev-
eral years we have tried to buy jtour trade
which you switch in secret to the hudsons
bay-

  you lie richelieu thundered wayne

  richelieu his face contorted doubled up
his arm as if to strike but with a glance at
the girl thought better of it and flung out his
open hand with a dramatic snap of the
fingers

  there but i will have the indian
whippers whip that out of your hide in the
post cellars to-night

  no no colonel cut in the voice of
david thompson who arrived suddenly out
of nowhere and the dark wilt have no
whipping in my post whilst i am keeper

  ciel thompson but your tongue is
ready if it were not that we need your
map-making i would have you drafted for
that

  but i knows ee do need tuh maps
nodded thompson so wilst have no
whippin in tuh cellars besides would
break tuh wine bottles

  well spoken whatever dawy grinned
james mckenzie while the company roared
and richelieu himself catching the con-
tagion relaxed into laughter again at the
public criticism of his own habits


adventure

  thompson for that thrust i forgive you
and ralph wayne escapes he chortled
are you not glad ralph as i was say-
ing we need your trade and so because it is
easier to take you here than at fort wayne
we do so also because mademoiselle joan
would as usual flout me there i take her here
where there is no flouting understand me
hola-couriers voyageurs metis all-seize
them

instantly carlisles arms were
round joan wayne making show of
seizing her before any one else could
touch her and swift as he eugene drum-
mond missowa and waseyawin laid rough
hands on wayne and held him fast seeing
the principals apparently in the grasp of
their own men the rest of the northwesters
pounced in a body upon waynes laden
brigade and before they could drop their
canoes and packs their arms were gripped
from either side by many hands

  off to the cellars with the canoemen
ordered richelieu and pushing fighting
cursing making vain efforts to break from
the grip of so many hands waynes brigade
swayed out into the dark

  now ralph wayne come and eat sup-
per with me you and mademoiselle joan
and see if a full stomach and a bottle of good
wine will make you change your mind if
you show sense you may come back to my
sturgeon lake post with joan and me if
you do not show sense you will go to join
your men in the cellars while joan goes back
alone with me

  the moment he heard the words father
andrews pushed through the crowd past his
friends elbowing his way to the front

  richelieu is half drunk he whispered to
them as he went they are all half drunk
-all but thompson mark my speech and
follow my move

  moil dieul exclaimed richelieu star-
ing at andrews in surprise who is this
but wait i remember now you are the
jesuit missionary who asked a nights shel-
ter at the post he gave andrews a
friendly hand donald mckay spoke of
you this afternoon but i did not catch the
name

  anrews

  par dial yes i know more of that
name than you think perhaps how dis-
courteous of me not to have inquired better
a famous name father and a herald of

deeds i have heard of you for years you
go among the men of the rival hudsons
bay too eh

  chiefly to bury them answered an-
drews gravely

  ho ho you are a wit father i
had heard that you must join us in the
meal you must sit at my table with
mademoiselle and her father comments
was there anything else you wanted

  i just wanted to ask about the maiden
parleyed the priest calmly turning to joan
wayne it occurred to me that she may
not be willing to have you carry her off like a
buccaneer to your sturgeon lake post
ah mademoiselle is father only she
does not know that she is

i only know flashed joan with a hate
and passion in her voice that bit like flame
that as sure as you put out one finger to
touch me you will feel a knife in your heart
but richelieu roared in ridicule

  ciel listen to that he pooh-poohed
what a death from gentle hands and
par dieu i believe it would be worth it
would it not father andrews name of a
name yes i do not care to remember the
number of months she has driven me crazy
with her coy refusals and her floutings
and is she a mate to hide away or be
ashamed of

  diable just look at her there-just look
but come my stomachs hungering for my
unfinished supper and i cant wait much
longer come father come all

  but it is not right for casual travelers to
take up space at your tables to the exclu-
sion of your own men who have worked hard
all day demurred andrews to gain time
here are packers whom i see to be raven-
ous for their meal and i who have cause to
know something of hunger will keep no man
waiting while i eat in his place

  these do not eat with the officers
richelieu pointed out and they do not all
eat at once neither is their fare what ours
is although at the same time it is good
enough for them

  for them echoed andrews are we
all not dwellers in the wilderness together
and is one man not as good as another
richelieu i have heard of you even as you
have heard of me and i know you are no
niggard therefore i ask a favor it is a
special occasion so let these men eat at once
with us and eat of the best you have when
strangers come men keep an open board
ambush



  mon dieu no i am no niggard rich-
elieu boasted pompously i grudge them
nothing father for they serve me well and
they shall have what you say and all that you
say only none of the grande portage
buildings will hold one-tenth of their
number

  true yet the stockade ground here will
hold them all suggested andrews craftily
straining for the point he wished to gain
and it is lighted like day with the canoe-
mens fires on yonder beach have canoe-
men and all gather here to eat and let every
man of your company see for himself how
fair a mate sits at your table

  del but you have spoken it father
cried richelieu swallowing the bait offered
to his conceit to his love of pomp and dis-
play thompson send out the word to
the beach for them all to gather within the
stockades they can sit on the steps and
the sand terrace and i will have them
served with food and wine where they sit

  thompson himself strode out of the stock-
ade ground and moved amid the mob across
the level sand beach toward the shoreway of
the long canoe pier at his word the canoe-
men leaving their fires with joyous whoops
over their good fortune surged up the beach
and into the stockade ground

  just when richelieu turns to lead us in-
run for the sloop was all andrews had op-
portunity to whisper to carlisle who under
richelieus watchful eye still had joan by
the arms

  carlisle passed the whisper to eugene
drummond missowa and waseyawin who
likewise had their hands upon the free-
trader and they all felt their tense nerves
thrill vibrantly as the last of the mob of
canoemen came in through the gateway
it required only a slight shifting of their
gaze to mark the eastern cribwork of the
old canoe pier where the fur sloop otter
empty after its run to the falls of st mary
lightly rubbed its rail against the timbers

  the harbor water within the angle of the
pier and also the curve of the sand beach
nearer at hand were lined with canoes the
beach itself starred with scores of camp-
fires sending their crimson flares across the
lake was deserted as andrews had schemed

  here stamping on the sand terrace
climbing on the steps were the men who had
peopled it eleven hundred and twenty en-
rolled canoemen-thirty-six brigades-the
total strength of the northwest companys

boatmen drawn from the worlds outposts
and massed together in one spot three hun-
dred and fifty rabiscaw paddlers of mon-
treal in company with all the countless in-
dians of the district gathered for the yearly
trade the carousal and the carnival

  never had carlisle gazed on so weird and
motley a horde of northmen and indians
and nowhere else on the continent could
richelieu have marshaled such a retinue
for these men canada and the atlantic
states were only faint memories somewhere
east the church for them was an im-
pression fainter still no man-made law
had they ever seen forged farther than the
sault

  they drew breath in an unclaimed land
and rum and bedlam rioted in their hearts
only their fear of richelieu postponed
their songs and their brawls as they jostled
up for their unexpected feast and in the
moment of their silence richelieu raised his
voice from the threshold of his dining hall

  ho northmen from the pays den
haut and you rabiscaw paddlers from
montreal he smirked voild here is a
priest with a kind heart and on his thought-
ful suggestion i-

  the snoring surge of waters swiftly
cloven a triumphal yell out of the lake-
ward dark the thump of a quickly-wielded
paddle upon a canoe gunwale interrupted
richelieu and the next instant a lone birch-
bark craft tore through the water gate of the
pier and spilled its single occupant upon the
beach outside the stockade

  who in the devil are you bellowed
richelieu glaring truculently as the in-
truder bounded in through the open gateway
and drove like a wedge up the jammed steps

  bertand-montreal mail courier-way-
laid-just escaped from the hudsons bay
mens camp down the north shore panted
the courier in french his furtive eyes filled
with the streaming lamplight scanning
them over and there leveling an excited
finger at carlisle is their factor wearing
my very clothes

carlisle his left hand keeping
its hold on the arm of joan wayne
launched his mighty body forward
his right foot shot into bertands chest his
right fist into the black beard of richelieu
and both men catapulted back off the
steps went rolling down the sand terrace
among the massed men
i

adventure

  swift as he struck he wheeled with the
girl to find that his companions had been
equally quick as one man they had
vaulted over the railing of the steps sheer
over the heads of the crowd sitting on the
terrace beneath knocking flat a dozen in
the outer rank who stood directly in the
way

  before they had fairly landed carlisle
gathering joan in his arms leaped after
them he alighted ankle-deep in the sand
plowing a furrow for yards in the loose
sugary grains and without halting his im-
petus plunged for the opening in the stock-
ade

  with a yell of exultation his five com-
rades clanged it behind him and dropped
the bar in place on the outside just as the
roaring avalanche of northmen brought up
against it then like fleeing deer they were
across the beach out on the pier and into the
fur sloop otter missowa and waseyawin
severing the hempen hawsers with their
sheath knives drummond kicking loose the
tiller and wayne and the priest running up
the big mainsail with a jerk

  the breeze had shifted at dark it now
blew steadily from the south snoring in
through the channel and like a live pal-
pitant thing the vessel responded to its
urge they could see richelieus horde of
northmen climbing the eighteen-foot pali-
sades and dropping to the ground outside
but before these could reach the waters
edge the mainsail tightened with a clatter of
blocks the boom uprose and the otter heeled
over as she left the pier

  ashore reigned bedlam pandemonium
all the vast motley crowd shuttling crazily
in the light of scores of fires shouting ex-
plaining commanding and countermanding
northwest officers were dashing out on the
pier yelling directions as they ran mctav-
ish macgillivray and todd in the lead and
fragments of their shouts rang stridently on
the ears of those in the boat upon the
channel

  - off in the sloop mctavish was

roaring launch the canoes and stop
them

  condemned scoundrels those four-
it was the shrill declamation of todd-and
the rascally priest as well

  and loudest of all the bull moose call of
macgillivray demanding of his partner-

  sager sager where in perdition are our
fond du lac brigades

  into the huge rabiscaw canoes they were
madly urging the crews all clamoring at
once and spurred by the curses of richelieu
who with the montreal mail-courier ber-
tand was running here and there like a mad-
man his uniform all dirty and his black
beard filled with sticky sand as he spat
forth french english cree and chippe-
wayan in one breath

  but the rabiscaws even though manned
by twenty paddles could not beat the
wind the otter already in mid-channel
maintained her lead rounded the island and
tore like a racing yacht down the rugged
loom of the north shore

  out of the desert into the mirage as the
western saying goes breathed joan all
her suspense and anxiety of the last few
minutes finding an expressiqn in a hysterical
laugh

  yes bantered carlisle you were pris-
oners of the northwesters now you are
prisoners of the hudsons bay-with every
prospect of improved treatment well
pick up my brigade at their camp down
here and go on to the mouth of the ka-
ministiquia

  so its not a courier i have to thank
after all but a factor she marveled whim-
sically and your men were in the mas-
querade too

  as it happened he admitted drum-
mond at the tiller yonder gave us warning
on the lake and it all worked out as you
saw andrews was a marvel

  he was that put in wayne warmly
not to speak of yourself i am not the
man to forget such a service to what post
do you belong

  lately to moose factory but to cum-
berland house when i reach there

  the devil the factor to fight us eh
and your name

  carlisle

  with an animal-like snarl wayne let go
the jib halyard and snatched the sheath
knife from the belt of missowa by his side
his face under the weak starlight was a
veritable blaze of ferocity and his fawn-
green eyes shone like the eyes of a lynx as
he lunged at carlisle with the long steel
blade

  stop man wait appealed andrews
leaping as wayne lunged

  but quick as was the priest to spring
joan was quicker she launched herself
between her father and carlisle her hands
ambush



upon waynes striking arm her whole
weight bearing down upon it like a leaden clog

  father you are mad she shrieked
he has just saved us from richelieu
youre forgetting the wilderness code you
cant touch him

  for a moment they swayed thus in the
careening sloop under the reeling stars car-
lisle grimly amazed vaguely angered poised
for resistance wayne suddenly frozen still
in his fury moving nothing but his fawn-
green eyes in continual shift from the factor
to the beseeching girl on his arm then the
free-traders body relaxed with a sound like
a groan as he allowed joan to wrest the
knife from his fingers and push him down to
his seat

no youre right girl he mumbled
its the code i cant touch him-yet

  carlisle also sat down

  by heavens he sneered sensing noth-
ing but bitter trade antagonism i like
your knife-edged gratitude

  but eugene drummond replacing the
long sweep he had unshipped to crash down
upon the free-traders head from behind
sensed something deeper it was the diable
mystery he had always sensed here it
was darker than ever andrews knew of it
wayne knew of it the factor did not
know that was plain

  eugene shook his raven hair this way and
that and swore darkly into the driving
wind as he brought the otter back on her
course

  for mm dieu had he not seen enough
to know that between the names wayne
and carlisle there was hate or fear or
wrong blood-feud or crime or worse

chapter iv

ambuscade

their weapons in their hands the hud-
sons bay men started up from their
camp on the north shore as drummond
steered the otter in half a dozen hands let
go the sheets and carlisle himself sprang
out into their midst

  by a the wilderness gods factor whats
happened noo cried lewis why are
ye back who are yer prisoners an
what in the deil are ye daein wi the north-
westers sloop i kenned at first it was a
drunken crew  the french company led
by yon slippery courier bertand



  im back lewis laughed carlisle
because richelieu and his partners are in
too great force at grande portage and the
kaministiquia is the only other route into
the west these with me are ralph wayne
the sturgeon lake free-trader and his
daughter joan who thought the hudsons
bay company men better warders than
the northwesters and we stole the sloop
in order to escape well beach it some-
where up the kaministiquia i have to
get into the pays den haut with all speed
things have come to a head now on the
saskatchewan

  shades o rupert ye are sayin so fac-
tor blurted lewis nodding to wayne
and doffing his glengarry cap to joan
tae a heid

  yes to a head repeated carlisle and
the quicker i am on the ground the better
who let bertand the courier away

  yon hound o a chippewa cotameg
cotameg was his warder ye ken an he
dozed lang enough tae let the courier roll
ower tae the mosquito smudge an burn the
thongs frae his wrists an ankles

  fine him three months pay was car-
lisles swift judgment if the like happens
again he leaves the service understand
lewis now strike camp at once

  the otter took them all aboard men
dunnage and canoes and bore away for the
mouth of the kaministiquia river before
daylight they made it tacked about in the
face of a strong head wind and through the
dark ran unseen past the sleeping north-
west post on up the river they scudded
till with the first streak of dawn the otter
grounded in rapid-broken shallows

  carlisle leaped out and caught his gear
bag tossed from the hands of drummond

  eugene he ordered have the canoes
loaded and all ready to go on while i get
rid of these couriers clothes

  he disappeared into a thicket up the
shore and in a few minutes appeared again
the swarthy stain washed from his face and
hands the battered blue felt hat cheap
cotton shirt and trousers gone he was his
old self once more clad in his cap of soft
amber leather rich blanket-coat deerskin
knickerbockers and high-cut moccasins and
with the assumption of his own garments he
had immediately assumed the greater ex-
clusiveness of his rank

  above all others in the brigade he loomed
large on the conception calm self-reliant
i

adventure

determined the reckless impulse of youth
within him curbed by an ancient wisdom
his whole personality manner speech in-
vested with unostentatious dignity sur-
charged with irrevocable authority

  as he walked down to the shallows where
joan wayne and her father awaited the
preparations of the brigade the girl gave
an involuntary exclamation she had ex-
pected some change in his appearance but
not such a change as this

  great as was the difference between the
status of courier and factor just so great
was the difference she saw and the spray of
red in her cheeks deepened and ran riot as she
remembered the grip of his arms round her in
grande portage and the ring of his voice as
he swore he would save her from richelieu

  but her father at her side was in no such
pleasant attitude of mind joan glancing
at him saw his face working with an emo-
tion that was nothing less than terrible

  charlie carlisle he was reiterating in
a low snarling tone charlie carlisle all
over again

  paul carlisle father corrected joan
laying a hand on his arm to quiet him
paul i heard father andrews call him
be calm wont you hes our enemy in
trade only and why should you make it
such a bitter personal hate

  you dont know what you are talking
about girl growled wayne you dont
know by the doom-the image of his
father before him

  waynes hand went to his waist clutching
for the weapon that was not there as his
fingers fumbled helplessly he seemed to re-
member his present plight and with a curse
abruptly turned his back

  all ready eugene called carlisle
cheerfully

  oui factor assured drummond
sweeping an expressive hand over the fleet
all ready for start i be got to double oop
two crews in dese canoes on account dose
crafts fadder andrews an bertand left on
grande portage

with garry as steersman eugene
himself had taken charge of one of
these canoes the second in the line
where from its bow he could command the
whole brigade and the fact that in so short
a time every bit of dunnage was trimmed for
balance every paddler in his proper posi-
tion bespoke his keen efficiency

  behind him one in charge of each separ-
ate craft were the three white men lewis
hampton and lea ahead of him floated
the splendid six-fathom canoe of the fac-
tor lipping a flat rock in the shallows wait-
ing for its owner its crimson flag and gon-
falon crackling as before the gay woolen
streamers blowing from the paddle shafts
and the paddlers themselves poised in their
bright costumes of gaily-decorated mocca-
sins leggings sashes fillets and plumes

  and gayest of all posed waseyawin and
missowa standing in the high curved bow
and stern their common disguises thrown
aside to let the wilderness world know their
rank as bowsman and steersman

  carlisles eye glistened with pride as he
glanced them over but with only a momen-
tary dwelling his gaze passed on to wayne
and his daughter

  now it comes to your decision he
spoke bluntly yet in the spirit of earnest
friendliness i can double up another
crew and spare you a canoe to go on to
montreal as you intended you may walk
down the bank to the kaministiquia post
or you may come back with me to cumber-
land house in the first two cases you go
freely in the third case you will be in cus-
tody

  waynes eyes held carlisles with a blaz-
ing gleam his whole intense being seemed
to leap out in that bitter gaze leaving his
lips no mission in speech and it was joan
tremulous and fearful of his wrath who
hastily answered for him

  there is no use in our going on to mon-
treal she pointed out the furs are gone
-a sixty thousand-dollar cargo besides
neither i nor my father wants to risk going
into northwest headquarters after what
happened at grande portage you know
that

  yes i judged so nodded carlisle
then its the kaministiquia post or cum-
berland house and i hope its cumber-
land house you see white women are so
scarce in this land that a man does not meet
and part with them lightly good heavens
i spent four years in london and there was
a woman there for every square rod of the
city

  ive lived seventeen years in wilderness
posts and in all that time seen very few
do you understand its made me appre-
ciate them wonderfully and somehow now
when i look at you im-im-well
ambush



frankly im glad that ive seen but few
  joan flushed at his patent warmth

  but its for my father to say she
evaded in confusion

  its cumberland house cut in wayne
suddenly finding speech and taking car-
lisles option as if he had heard nothing
that intervened condemnation why
should we rot in the kaministiquia post
we will go back to our own district joan
the district they would wrest from us and
there by the doom theyll see who does
the wresting

  youll give parole asked the factor
ignoring the threat

  no thundered wayne put a guard
on us and keep us if you can

  very well nodded carlisle grimly my
eyes will be guard enough

  he took a step aside to where father
andrews waited silently on the bank

  a strange violent man father-yes
and bitter as gall against the hudsons
bay he whispered if it were not for
the girls sake i would give him back some
of his own medicine she interests me
greatly so will you pair amidships with
wayne then the girl and i will sit be-
hind you

  as you like paul agreed the priest
taking the indicated place i am glad
you have your temper under control there
is no gam in letting it slip

 carlisle gave joan his hand as she
stepped in but when he motioned the free-
trader to follow the latter drew back de-
fiantly

  i ride in the next he growled i will
not ride with you though youve put me
under the code my hands still itch for the
ojibways knives

  all right if you feel like that assented
the factor

 he waved wayne aboard drummonds
craft

  eugene he enjoined he is under
your eye

  then he stepped into his own canoe
meeting with a good-humored laugh joans
deprecatory face rendered ashamed as
well as alarmed by her fathers fresh defi-
ance she had remained standing perturbed
uncertain as to the outcome of the verbal
clash now quite naturally they sat down
together upon the rich ermine robe and
the brigade shot up the kaministiquia

  in the wake of la verendrye whose prow

had first cut these waters in  they
went and as the silence of the forest en-
veloped them eugene drummonds clear
tenor struck up an air to time the paddles
of his canoemen

  all day and half the night the fleet wound
up the rock-walled spruce-hedged kamin-
istiqua to its source lake shebandowan
across golden shebandowan over jeweled
lake kashaboyes toward the range of gran-
ite which hurled the western waters back
to winnipeg

  the setting sun did not drop behind the
gray crags of the range till nine in the even-
ing and then the orange-rose afterglow
burned its witch-light for an hour more
but abruptly as the orange-rose turned
saffron stalked the jealous dark and night
and the brigade camped together upon the
crest of the superior divide

  at morning they left the height of land
behind them and like the flash of their pad-
dles the days went by as they plunged
down the western slope of the watershed
through lac des mille isles the seine
river rainy lake rainy river and lake
of the woods all the way by paddle pole
and portage eugene drummond pitched
the canoe song for his gay-souled voyageurs

  ralph waynes glowering hate grew
darker as he hit upon no opportunity to
escape and the strangely-begun intimacy
between joan and carlisle blossomed and
thrived at a pace that set her father to
brooding stately figures upon the vast
tapestry of forest verdure they passed with
no untoward incident until after leaving
lake of the woods

then as they rounded a bend of
the winnipeg river some miles
above lac du bonnet waseyawin
uttered a cry of warning from the bow of
the factors flying canoe instantly mis-
sowa and the middlemen caught it their
blades back-watered with a gurgling roar
and the prow of the craft brought up within
ten feet of a chaos of dead tamarack trunks
which choked the stream

  a windfall eh cried father andrews
that was a close thing paul

  no-no windfall declared carlisle
standing up to see better look at the
ax marks on the butts its a barricade
missowa waseyawin-back back drum-
mond-quick

  but hard on his words and before the


ac venture

brigade had time to swing about came the
chug-chug of axes behind them a score of
dead birches swayed out from the bushy
margin and crashed into the river in an
impassable tangle of crossed trunks and in-
terwoven branches and out upon the
barricades before and behind poured over
one hundred northwesters the choppers
with their bright-bladed axes still in hand
the others with long-barreled rifles trained
on the hudsons bay brigade

  carlisle recognized on the instant james
and roderick mckenzie mcleod and mc-
dougall with their returning athabasca
brigades and richelieu with his sturgeon
lake brigade all apparently bound into
the pays den haut

  mon dieu carlisle but i have you
trapped now roared richelieu you and
ralph wayne and mademoiselle and your
renegade priest

  yes carlisle guffawed roderick mc-
kenzie i had thought you too good a
woodsman to put your head into a deadfall
like that 

  never mind your tongue play you two
the impetuous mcleod cut in on them
take these men prisoners lift their arms
clear yon barricade and lets be on our
way

  in my own good time mcleod bul-
lied richelieu neither you nor an
other man can hurry me you see carlisle
youve tried the patience of mcleod and
the others the pigeon river route into
the lake of the woods is faster than the
kaministiquia route and par dieu weve
waited for you here longer than weve liked
comprenez-vohs do you surrender
quietly

  carlisle sweating in the sun-heat off the
river which seemed suddenly to have grown
more intense cast swift calculating glances
to right to left and behind

  surrender he echoed trying to gain
time by parleying and all the while seeking
for some means of apparently impossible
escape what under heaven do you
northwesters set yourselves up to be
even though your claim to grande portage
holds good-and t tell you bluntly that it
doesnt-this is not grande portage this
is the winnipeg-the west and i want to
ask you by what right you stop any traveler
on winnipeg waters

  by the right of might msieu an-
swered richelieu insolently we have our

secret service also and we know your mis-
sion into the saskatchewan ciel do you
think i am fool enough to let you go on to
sturgeon lake when i have the chance to
cut you off here it was my plan to take
you at grande portage but there was a
slip i lost track of you for a little-until
the courier bertand exposed you

  diable i have not forgotten your mas-
querade nor the blow you gave me for
everything you will answer toute suite car-
lisle-oui and mademoiselle will come back
where she belongs

  through every word of richelieus tirade
carlisle felt his face fairly crisping with the
increasing heat he put his feeling down
to the well-nigh unbearable suspense of the
moment and to the fact that they lay mo-
tionless upon the sun-refracting water in
windless air held stagnant by the forested
shores but as richelieu finished his bold
prophecy a sharp tang permeating the
heat wave stung carlisles sensitive nostrils

  smoke he exclaimed hoarsely to the
others in the canoe is that another trick
of these curs

  mcdougall up on the loftiest log of the
barricade caught the tang at the same mo-
ment he whirled suddenly to face down-
stream

  holy dog-ribs he shouted look-
richelieu look the whole forests on fire
mcdougall pointed aghast where not
over five hundred yards away as far round
the river bend as he could see a black pall
rolled up above the tamarack tops along
both banks and shooting flames darted like
red horned devils between the dark trunks

  diablement richelieu swore some
of your careless whelps have dropped match
or pipe mcdougall run everybody run
in canoes and up-stream and mon dieu
paddle for your cursed lives

  he himself led the rout before the charg-
ing flames plunging headlong from the bar-
ricade into the thicket of green where they
had hidden their canoes when they arranged
the ambuscade like madmen the hundred
of them ripped and tore through the growth
bending chopping trampling down ob-
structing saplings and shoving their crafts
afloat above the upper barricade

  name of a name come on yelled
richelieu as the paddles foamed away
carlisle - wayne - joan chere - all you
there hola follow us its your only
chance
ambush



 what do you think drummond
snapped carlisle feverishly follow and
be captured or try to run through the fire

  ba gar breathed his brigade leader
shes so hot im tink we burn to cinder
still de smoke she seem to start close mab-
be i be take wan look an see if de rivaire
be smokin for miles we nevaire do it if
shes shallow fire mebbe we make de dash

  in an attempt to gage the depth of the
conflagration eugene leaped out upon the
barricade but as he thrust a bronzed face
over the topmost trunk another face was
thrust into his from the other side a brown-
bearded long-jawed plainsmans face
weather wrinkled and alkali seared the yel-
lowed teeth jarred apart in a triumphant
grin

  mason exclaimed joan wayne in an
odd high-pitched tone

  by the doom-yes mason echoed her
father

  and carlisle drummond andrews mis-
sowa and waseyawin suddenly remem-
bered him one of the missouri men
waynes brigade leader whom they had
last seen in the grip of the northwesters as
they dragged him and his companions off
to the cellars of grande portage

  come on implored mason frantically
my pardners fired her back a bit to skeer
them cusses off twas the only sartin way
we seen come on ye kin run through
her

  the missourian had an ax in his hand
and even while he implored he brought it
into play upon the up-thrusting branches
of the barricading trees slashing a three-
foot passageway down to the water level

  there was neither time nor need to cut
the floating trunks at a command from
carlisle the whole brigade swarmed out
upon them the six canoes were whipped
from the water passed through the gap and
launched on the other side

  all aboard shouted carlisle now
-wet blankets on your heads and paddle
like very demons

  he swiftly set the example soaking a
blanket overside and drawing it as a pro-
tecting canopy over the girl the priest and
himself

  thats the trick approved mason who
had tumbled in beside wayne in drum-
monds canoe  twould be a turrible sin
to scorch yon ha-ar of joans its a short
run boys but hot as hades

flying down-stream into the face
of the flame the heat struck them
with magnified force like a searing
furnace blast either bank was a moving
wall of fire sputtering and shrieking in a
medley of impish voices flare of dry leaves
crackle of underbrush sizzle of green pine-
needles pop of resinous knots crash of
half-consumed stubs and the patter plop
and hiss of embers ceaselessly raining upon
shore rocks and river surface

  and all these lesser voices blended as
separate notes into a symphony of vast
volume of awesome power the gargantuan
roar of the fire giant bellowing a thunder-
ous diapason

  carlisle felt the blanket on his head
grow warm and commence to steam he
breathed in gasps in the stifling heat and
smoke the blood pounding so hard in his
head as to make him dizzy he wondered
if joan would faint in that inferno and he
blindly put out his hand toward her to re-
assure himself his fingers touched and
closed on hers burning fever-hot beneath
the blanket folds

  a moment more and well be through
joan he cheered

  joan had one hand covering her mouth
as an additional safeguard against the
smoke but her fingers tightened on his
in answer and the grip sent a fierce thrill
through his frame

  the devil boomed the cavernous voice
of lewis somewhere behind were gaein
doon

  at the cry carlisle threw back a corner
of the blanket in time to see lewis canoe
disappear suddenly leaving its four occu-
pant swimming with the current the ter-
rific heat had melted the pitch on the birch-
bark seams letting in the water as into a
sieve

  gae on lewis urged dinna stop
for us its muckle cooler swimmin

  before the man of the hebrides and his
indians had taken a dozen strokes in the
water down went hamptons canoe and
twelve heads now dotted the river surface
diving reappearing and diving again to
escape the blistering breath of the flames
leas craft waterlogged and careening
promised to follow suit but drummonds
heavily-laden canoe still flew like an arrow
and the factors canoe ahead likewise
heavily-laden so that its seams lay mainly
under water traveled as yet unharmed


adventure

  flying canoes and racing fireline were
meeting at tremendous speed but as if the
fireline were standing still the faster crea-
tures of the forest broke from cover and
passed the whizzing canoes like scurry-
ing autumnal leaves the lesser birds flew
through the rolling smoke pall

  wedges of geese and ducks drove by on
whistling wings coveys of partridges
flushed with a drum-like roaring palpitant
hares spurned the ground in fear-mad
leaps squirrels chattering demented
hurled themselves across the latticework
of branches the lordly caribou antlers
back and noses outstreched crashed up-
stream like bombshells through the forest
growth

  amid a demoniacal tumult of earth and
air they struck the fireline a mass of blaz-
ing limbs whirled down and lodged on the
bow of the factors canoe like tinder
the dry birch-bark flared up but waseya-
win bare-handed cast the burning debris
off and with a scoop of his paddle dashed
a gallon of water on the flaring bow

  the blaze sputtered out with a malig-
nant hiss the cree dug in his blade and
the next moment the craft leaped out of
the seething inferno into a strangely-quiet
reach of stream where the smoking ash-
filmed ground lay white as snow and the
blackened trees slid by like specters wink-
ing red-hot eyes at every puff of wind

chapter v

the iliad of the forest

 toan are you burned at all demanded
j carlisle throwing the half -charred
blanket aside scorched even hair-face
-hands

  the girl drew the sweet smokeless air
into her lungs with a gasp

  no paul no she assured him the
flames never touched me are you all
right-and my father and father andrews
and the rest

  all safe apparently therell be singed
heads and blistered skins for a while but
everybodys come through fine

  aye murmured father andrews they
have-by the grace of god

  and mason supplemented wayne
from drummonds canoe behind

  by jove yes by grace of mason too
carlisle lauded if it hadnt been for

mason we might not have tried to run the
gantlet

  thats what i was thar fer to give ye
the word grinned mason ye see they
had a celebrashun fer the mckenzies
mcleod mcdougall and richelieu when
they left grande portage fer the athabasky
everybody got roarin drunk and some-
body left the bar off the door of our cellar

  thompson dropped a word about ye git-
tin away wayne with hudsons bay men
bound into the saskatchewan so on course
we got out of the cellar at dark and stole
canoes rifles and grub to last and follered
them drunk cusses up the pigeon we
figgered yer partyd come in by the kamin-
istiquia and we soon seen richelieu fig-
gered so too they traveled like hell-fire
aimin to head ye off and git to the winni-
peg river first

  they done it all right and barricaded her
and lay by fer two days and when they
bushwhacked ye jist now we had to chase
them with fire shell heel them miles back
to the pechilaux and red sand rivers
cornin in on either bank shell stop thar
i calkilate hullo thars my men on the
shore time too fer this cussed canoes
goin down

  leas craft had already gone drum-
monds settled by the river margin amid all
the swimmers from the other crafts and all
pulled themselves out dripping upon the
ashy shore where waited waynes men of
the mississippi men of the missouri men
of the red along with his stony crees and
chippewayans

  wayne stamped the water off as he made
his way along the bank to the factors
canoe still sound and strong where it lay
grazing the river rocks

  well he laughed grimly his fawn-
green eyes glowing into carlisles where the
latter sat amidships fire is always a mans
friend if its properly used and i guess its
my friend right here

 you mean-

  of course i mean that im the big
chief now and its my turn to powwow
your crew of six have their arms left the
arms of all the other crews are at the winni-
pegs bottom you cant stand up against
my thirty-two armed men so tell your
paddlers to step out with their hands up

  wikl wik carlisle yelled sharply to
his crew

  swift as lightning they dipped their
ambush



paddles in a terrific drive the great
canoe leaped its own length like a spurred
horse and sheered off into mid-river

  stop wayne bellowed rapide des
boisfrancs just below you cant run it
its never been run by the doom before

youll drown my girl ill-

  he broke off to snatch a rifle from the
hands of the nearest man and level it at the
canoe

  carlisle-stop stop or ill shoot you
like a skunk

  but at the menace of the rifle muzzle joan
sitting on carlisles left hand sprang up as a
shield between

  father dont fire she implored you
forget-you forget

  i forget nothing sit down girl-sit
down i say

  joan did not sit down but a lurch of the
canoe in the eddies set her swaying so that
carlisle pulled her down the action put
their bodies out of line where they sat and
instantly waynes rifle cracked carlisle
heard the rip of the puncturing ball through
the canoe from side to side above the water-
line and at the same moment he felt a solid
blow like the thud of a stone on his left
leg below the knee

  blankly surprised he looked down to see
the calf of his high-cut deerskin moccasin
punctured from side to side as neatly as the
birch-bark skin of the canoe blood was
spreading over his leg and trickling down
the creamy deerskin to his ankle hastily
he thrust the wounded limb under a dun-
nage bag before joan should see

  missowa twisted the stern and flung the
craft cleanly across the river bend so that
a rock shoulder intercepted waynes line of
fire they were round the bend swinging
into the grip of the powerful tugging cur-
rent writhing down to rapide des boisfranc

  waynes free-traders had hidden their
own canoes in the forest below the rapid
ready for hasty flight when they crept up
the shore to spoil richelieus ambuscade
now those in the racing factors canoe
could hear them clamoring as they crashed
along over the mile portage in a vain at-
tempt to overtake the craft before it could
reach white water

  oh my father shouldnt have fired that
way censured joan still unaware of
carlisles wound for he might have killed
you paul hes not himself i swear hes
not himself hes mad with an enmity ive

never seen him hold before-with a hate
thats quite beyond me

  i know nodded carlisle turning a
grimace of pain into a smile and you see
how impossible it was for me to let myself be
taken prisoner im sorry joan to have to
hurl you through these infernal rapids but
it cant be helped now we cant stop to
land you youll have to hold on tightly
and keep your weight as low as possible
now take your grip yonders white
water ahead

with terrific speed they were
shooting down the black ominous
surges at the head of the rapids
surges twisting and writhing like a brood of
mighty pythons between the crowding walls
of rock fast as the river ran the craft
was running faster flung bodily ahead of the
mad current by the desperate paddles of
waseyawin missowa and the four middle
men

  not for an instant might they allow the
rivers velocity to approximate the canoes
velocity because in that instant control
would be lost to their blades and disaster
ensue

  half a dozen canoe lengths from the foam-
ing snarl of white water the bowsman
waseyawin gave a high-pitched yell as a
signal at his cry the tremendous speed of
the paddle strokes abruptly doubled till it
seemed some deep magic and not the skill
of men which plied blades that the quick eye
could scarcely follow

  the canoe was fairly torn from the suck
of the dark water and launched like a
meteor through the white waseyawin
gave another yell as one man the four
middlemen shipped paddles leaving wase-
yawin and missowa standing at bow and
stern to twist the huge craft this way or that

  waseyawin eyes focused on the moil
below read the river as white men read a
book and ever his high-pitched yells split
the tumult of the waters drifting back to
missowa in the stern telegraphing him what
lay ahead-tossing billow seething white
water angry eddy treacherous cross current
fountained spray that marked the jagged
rock or shallow foam that masked the
sunken boulder

  through a mist of flying drops they
rocked over the edge of the cascade proper
and plunged sheer down a milk-white chute
as steep as a flight of stairs


adventure

  nerved as she was by her fathers training
against all northland menaces joan felt her
spirit quaking at the sickening drop nau-
sea dulled her senses terror gripped her
heart she shrank from the roaring brutal
maw of the river shrank from its slaver and
fangs pressing tremblingly closer and closer
to carlisle

  my god-my god she quavered as
they struck the base swells of the cascade
with a tearing sound like the ripping of a
thousand yards of silk are we gone
paul

  no joan were all right carlisle
soothed well go through if i hadnt
full faith in my indians do you think i would
have risked it with you

  he loosened his grip and like a child he
drew her shrinking body into the hollow of
his arms

  i wouldnt have risked it joan he de-
clared i havent found you that long to
lose you so soon dont you understand
girl cant you realize what finding you
back there at grande portage has meant to
me

  the frightened face upturned to his the
face blanched of its customary color lost
the rigidity of terror grew mellow warm
sprayed with its crimson again and her eyes
deepened under some potent emotion to an
amethyst shade in the grip of the colos-
sal elemental forces heaving through a boil-
ing caldron on the edge of death her
feminine finesse that under other circum-
stances would have kept him at bay tan-
talized in doubt was torn away and to her
lips of no denial carlisle on wild impulse
suddenly pressed his own

  a barrel of water shipped over the bow
when the canoe buried its nose in the grand
swell drenched them both as it rolled from
end to end

  bail carlisle commanded the middle-
men

  with a mighty trembling the canoe shook
itself free and aided by the increased buoy-
ancy as the shipped water was flung out
rose upon the silver-gray backs of the
swells tobogganed down a series of fluid ter-
races and shot between two madly-gyrating
whirlpools studded with stump-like rocks

  once more waseyawin uttered a violent
yell the four paddles of the middlemen
came down into the swirl and though the
giant tentacles of the twin maelstroms
gripped and tore at the craft like the arms

of a gigantic devil-fish the added impetus
carried them through

  they were in the leaping lashing billows
near the end of the rapids a few more
strokes meant calmer water but squarely
in the path showed a half-sunken boulder
round wave-worn dark-green in color
standing like some titan warrior of old
taking upon his bruised face the eternal
hammering of the river

  swiftly waseyawin jabbed his paddle
deep under the bow to swing wide but the
already strained paddle snapped like a dead
branch in his hands the head of the canoe
swerved back toward the rock missowa
the steersman taking the opposite stroke
to waseyawins in the pivotal shift could
not throw the stern round far enough to
clear and before the middleman behind
waseyawin could hand him his paddle in
place of the broken one the craft reared
upon the boulder

  a grating sound ran along the bottom
and the thin birch-bark heaved in the cen-
ter all in a flash they lodged whirled
half-way round were spewed off to bring
up with a drifting smash among a litter of
granite blocks lying like thrown dice in the
shore shallows the canoe pitched on its
side spilling its occupants headforemost
into the rubble-filled pools and the first
ones out of the tangle were waseyawin and
missowa

  crying to their middlemen to salve the
canoe packs and arms they rushed to the
aid of the whites father andrews in
water to his waist and weighted by his
soaked cassock was slowly making his way
ashore carlisle lay motionless in a foot of
water his head upon a stone with joan
bending over him

  hes stunned she gasped as missowa
and waseyawin reached her see the
bruise there on his temple his leg is hurt
and bleeding as well carry him ashore
quickly

  for answer missowa whipped the gay
sash from his waist over her mouth while
waseyawin seized her wrists and tied them
behind her back with the fillet from his
head

  be quick my cree brother urged
missowa deftly knotting the gag the
free-trading men must not find us here

  he pushed the girl up the bank in wase-
yawins charge and exerting all his lithe
strength raised the limp form of the factor
ambush

 

and followed father andrews splashed
out on his heels and after the priest ran the
four middlemen carrying the arms and
packs and rent canoe upon their heads

  they left no dripping water trail if any
one should search for the rocks for yards
around were wet with the spray of the
rapids and once off the rocks they staggered
up the granite bed of a little spring that
trickled the length of a deep ravine

rat the head of the ravine they
clambered over lichened stones
dank moss carpets and beds of fern
is green as chrysoprase through the
loom of the pines treading soundless as
hosts upon the fallen needles they passed
md came out on rolling ground forested
with silvery birch

  they had worked over half a mile from
the river and in a tiny clearing missowa let
down his burden upon a bed of dry leaves
waseyawin pushed joan to a seat upon a
mossy rock beside and taking a rifle from
the middlemen who crowded up glided back
to keep watch upon the river

  father andrews seized one of the packs
and from it extracted the medicine kit he
was accustomed to carry in his ministering
among the indians it contained a flat tin
llask full of brandy and using the screw-
cap the priest poured a few spoonfuls be-
tween carlisles lips and began to chafe him
while missowa cut away the water-soaked
blood-stained moccasin from his leg

  a flesh wound announced the ojibway
unemotionally baring the calf and manipu-
lating the leg to feel for a break the
bones are sound

  thats good andrews exclaimed i
was afraid the jagged rocks had broken it
clean

  but ayumeaookemou priest it was
not the rocks

  ah-hah what then

  it was the free-traders bullet and had
it not been for the twist of my paddle it
would have been through the factors
heart

  father andrews gave a startled exclama-
tion his eyes met missowas fell to the
bullet-torn limb and then shifted quickly
to joans face he and missowa had been
talking in cree but he realized all at once
that she understood the language she
could not speak for the sash over her
mouth yet into her eyes flooded a silent

eloquence surprise commiseration anxiety
-yes something deeper andrews thought

  she rose from the rock one of the mid-
dlemen made as if to stop her but the priest
shook his head and she came and stood be-
hind while they worked upon carlisle for
nearly an hour they persisted before he
showed signs of returning consciousness
missowa had the leg bathed the bullet-rip
rinsed with pure water from a spring near-by
poulticed with healing balsam gum brought
from the ridge beyond the clearing and all
neatly bandaged before the factors eyes
opened

  when they did open upon the mask-like
mosquito veil of the priest upon missowas
swarthy face with the surface lights in the
black eyes gleaming in solicitation almost
akin to tenderness upon joan standing there
in her gag and bonds carlisle felt himself
still in the nightmare of the canoe smash

  wha-at-what under the- he began
in shaky syllables

  dont talk too loud warned father
andrews were hidden here from the
free-traders and voices carry far in the
forest

  the free-traders are gone spoke the
voice of waseyawin who glided like a wraith
out of the gloom of the pines they came
searching at the foot at the rapids they
found all our paddles the nose-cloth of the
golden daughter and one pack that was
washed away it was the nose-cloth that
set shining horns to weeping

  they think the canoe sunk and all of us
drowned demanded carlisle

  so answered waseyawin the grief
of shining horns was terrible to see i
think he would have cast himself into the
whirlpool had not others led him away
they dared not wait long these others for
fear of the french companys men behind
they went on with our own men as pris-
oners in their canoes and it is well they
went because black-beard and his followers
came after i waited to see if that would
come to pass before i left my watch

  your eyes are good my cree brother
eulogized missowa even as good as your
paddle in white water now that shining
horns and his men are gone golden daugh-
ter may be freed

  with deft hands the ojibway unknotted
the sash and whipped it back on his waist
at the same time handing waseyawin the
fillet for his head


adventure

  oh my poor father cried joan tears
in her eyes hell be half-crazed and
richelieu may catch him yet upon the
river

  how much start had he andrews
asked carlisle

  about an hour informed the priest
then richelieu wont catch him joan
decided the factor once warnedwayne
is not the man to be overtaken hell have
a scouting craft out behind his brigade if
hostile canoes are reported he can leave the
rive the same as we did so dont worry
your father will be safe all right and well
bring you back to him as sound as ever at
sturgeon lake

  but yourself paul she burst out im-
petuously dropping to her knees beside him

your own hurts-

  im all right checked carlisle with a
smile theres nothing the matter with
me but a good headache and a gash in the
leg that a spiked branch might have made
yet how can you forgive me my fathers
intent

  you know why dont you he mur-
mured so low that the others could not
hear besides he fired out of desperate
fear for you as any one-as i myself would
have done dont you worry girl but
hurry and dry your clothes the indians
will have a shelter ready for you in a few
minutes missowa waseyawin address-
ing his familiars bid the middlemen make
three bough camps and small fires in front
that will not smoke above the tree-tops
also gather and cook the evening meal
very soon the shelters were ready and
occupied one by each of the three whites
shelters consisting simply of circles of
forked saplings thrust into the ground like
teepee poles overlaid with balsam boughs
and floored with the same in the opening
glowed heaps of charred fragments taken
from blackened tree trunks and stumps the
remains of former forest fires

  in the central space of the clearing wase-
yawin had kindled another cooking fire
missowa had taken the middlemen off to set
a length of gill net in the river and hunt the
evergreens for grouse presently these re-
turned with both finned and feathered game
several giant trout and pickerel and half a
dozen partridges knocked from their roosts
by sticks

  the delicious odor of crisping fish of
broiling partridge of baking bannocks of

simmering tea filled the camp space drifting
tantalizingly upon the evening breeze
with magical celerity a home-like atmo-
sphere had been created in the midst of the
wilderness and the tiny clearing hard by the
pine gloom and walled round with the
creeping dusk took on the well-defined air of
ancient use

  lying in their shelters the whites ate their
meal while they dried their steaming clothes
and once they were done with the serving
the canoemen squatted by themselves
bending over the kettles and pots of the cen-
tral fire their red-bronze frames and
swarthy faces touched carmine by the
flamelight hungrily they ate and lighted
their pipes missowa delaying long enough
to bring carlisles own pipe to his teepee

  here is dry tobacco factor he an-
nounced and the steel that makes the fire
flint and steel

  put them there directed carlisle and
missowa have the middlemen whittle out
new paddles weaving woolen streamers for
them from the ball of wool you will find in
the packs also see that the canoe is
mended with care we start on at
dawn

  when the ojibway had gone back to the
fire to set the middlemen at their tasks
carlisle filled and lighted his pipe ecstatic-
ally savoring the tobaccos perfume and the
other camp fragrances that stole so fa-
miliarly into his nostrils the supper scent
the pungent wood smoke the spice of bal-
sam and pine the resinous pitch the in-
dians were melting the steam of human
garments

  for it was ever at such moments as these
that the incomparable thrill of the life in the
wild rushed over him in a surge of joy so
fierce as to be akin to pain here men
lived he exulted here was no cramped
purposeless existence no desk-bound slavery
such as he had come to visualize in his four
years of london this was the epic life
the homeric essay the iliad of the forest

  dreamily his eyes and his soul and his
senses lapsed and before he was aware his
hand slipped limply from his pipe and the
pipe fell from his lips the night crept on
the young moon showed for a little over the
balsam ridge bathing the forest like a radiant
mist glowing through the latticed branches
checkering each clearing in silver and black
overlaying the ghostly birch trunks with
luminous pearl
ambush



the transient light filtered
through carlisles bough shelter
touched his face and receded again
as the moon set behind the ridge but
neither moonrise nor moonset served to
waken him still he dozed till the slight
scuffle of a moccasin stirred him

  yet true to his woodsmans instinct he
stirred inwardly not outwardly giving no
muscular response to the impression from
without till he should have sensed whether
friend or enemy wore the scuffling mocca-
sins his body retained its immobility
only his eyelids parted almost impercept-
ibly till he could glimpse the fire-lit en-
trance where his mosquito smudge flared and
smoked and hissed its defiance to the
whining pests

  then he saw in their dainty materialism
the moccasins that had wakened him two
tiny creations of elkskin like cinderella
slippers of the forest so small that they
could have walked upon his outstretched
palms they revealed the identity of his
visitor none but joan wore such fairy
footgear

  he shifted his furtive gaze upward to
see her swelling-hipped full-bosomed figure
silhouetted in the ochre glow he could
mark the wonderful fairness of her skin the
sparkle of the lake-blue eyes the shimmer
of her hair that gleamed like a frosted web
of fine gold threads with every flare of the
smudge

  paul how does your wound feel now
she asked

  some sudden unaccountable whim kept
carlisle silent

  hesitatingly joan stepped over to where
he lay upon the balsam boughs he seemed
asleep his eyelids closed in the dim light
of the interior she noted the bandage upon
his stockinged leg and the discoloration of
the bruise upon his temple and a flood of
mingled feeling rushed over her

  all in an instant she was swept and
shaken by the romantic glamor of their first
meeting that eventful night at grande
portage by the sweet companionship of
their days of wilderness travel by the pas-
sionate unbaring of carlisles heart in the
wild dash through the rapide des boisfranc

  standing over him her own heart beat in a
tumult and though her intellect flashed a
vague warning of restraint it could not
curb the impulsive surge of her emotion
swiftly she stooped pressed her warm bps

to carlisles lips and fled back on silent
winged feet to her own tent

  his fibers all a-throb carlisle opened his
eyes instinctively his arms went out but
joan had vanished too quickly like a
wood nymph she had come and like a wood
nymph she had gone too ethereal for the
human grasping

  all carlisles arms encircled was the
empty air all his wide-open eyes saw was
the stoic indians mending the six-fathom
canoe it lay  its side by the fire one
gunwale propped up with sticks the yellow
bark shining deep orange under the magic
flames

  over the rents missowa and waseyawin
were fitting strips of canvas while the mid-
dlemen poured on the resinous pitch a
study in red yellow bronze crimson um-
ber and orange they worked ringed round
by the velvet band of the forest starred here
and there with the prying eyes of the watch-
ers of the wild

  carlisle followed the shift of the eyes un-
consciously and by the eyes and the scurry-
ings among the leaves he read the identity
of each-a darting weasel or mink a timid
doe with her fawn a porcupine running a
log a pack of full-bellied harmless wolves
worming like dogs toward the fascinating
glare

  and in the trees above he read analogous
sounds the feathered wild things of the air
going abroad with their kin of the earth the
plaintive whippoorwill the rasping night
hawk the hooting owl on its noiseless pin-
ions all the wilderness had awakened
with the moonset the susurrus of the pine
sang overhead like passing winds and
winds themselves arising no one knew how
dying no one knew where came and went
like unseen hosts on the march

  beaver slapped their pistol-like warnings
in the ponds below the balsam ridge bull
moose called from the thickets beside
never for a moment was the night-world
still yet buoying all these noises car-
lisle sensed an underswell of silence the
poise of the lonely land passive brooding
nirvanic the voiceless spirit of the north
itself lying mute in its ambush waiting to
spring upon men in the unguarded moment
of their weakness

  the pale-yellow stars in the purple sky
seemed planets appointed to another sphere
and the only gleam which showed in the
dark austere immensity of the earth itself


adventure

was the fitful sweep of the aurora above the
trees on the ridge and the phosphorescent
smear of organic gases waving over the black
muck marsh beneath carlisle gazed at
the pyrotechnic display till too prolonged
gazing began to produce internal flashes in
his brain and he dropped his head for
sleep

  all the rest of the camp slumbered save
missowa and waseyawin who before turn-
ing in with their fellows were sitting a mo-
ment by the fire pointing with the stems of
their pipes at the aurora and the will-o-the-
wisps they were talking in hissing gurg-
ling lisping cree and the trend of their
speech was the last sound to reach carlisles
drowsy ears

  behold my cree brother spoke mis-
sowa there are the spirit lights in their
summer garb the souls of our forefathers
rushing rank on rank into battle for the
dead die not waseyawin but live to hunt
and fish and fight again even as you and i
shall do their robes of light and flashing
spears are but signs for their children and
their childrens children here in the forest
below

  ae missowa nodded the cree signs
that we will follow when our last camp-fire is
burned but these others indicating the
dancing incandescent will-o-the-wispswe
do not follow for they my ojibway
brother are the lures of our enemies of
shining horns and his men they think us
at the bottom of the whirlpools and these
lights they have put out by magic to lead
our drowned souls astray

chapter vi

the dead arise

three hundred miles of headland-
broken island-studded gale-thrashed
roller-raped winnipeg lay behind one hun-
dred and more of the sinuous saskatchewan
and at last through the long twilight of a
northern evening cumberland house
loomed up on pine island lake the western
arm of the sturgeon

  july had run out upon lake winnipeg
where head winds held them behind shel-
tering points where erratic squalls beached
them upon stormy lee shores where rain-
choked gales flailed them upon barren islets
smothering any attempt at fire leveling any
attempt at shelter roaring and ramping for

five days at a stretch it was the first week
of august and the end of carlisles long
journey from james bay

  the end and how familiar an end his
mind turned back to the time when he had
sojourned here with thompson long years
before planning and executing for the day
of undisputed supremacy of the hudsons
bay company and his blood leaped as he
glimpsed the well-remembered log post
buildings the stout stockade the tall flag-
staff with the blood-red banner of his cor-
poration flapping from its tip

  all about the stockade straggled indian
teepees of the tribes come in to trade the
smoke of many teepee fires spiraled through
the dusk and a babel of noises rose from the
camps the guttural jargon of the hunters
and squaws laughter of the maidens wails
of papooses shrieks of children at play
barking of mongrel dogs

  suddenly these noises stilled men lin-
ing the stockade standing upon the firing
steps and leaning over the palisades had
caught sight of carlisles huge canoe a
voice commanded silence and then with a
surge a loud cheer burst from whites and
indians alike

  they recognized even in the dusk the
hudsons bay flag in the canoe bow the
long gonfalon in the stern the gaudy cos-
tumes woolen streamers slanting feathers
that graced the canoemen of a factor
here then was the new overlord they ex-
pected-here was carlisle of far moose
factory

  the gate swung open swiftly and a bare-
headed swarthy-skinned heavily-built half-
breed came forward cree blood showed in
his eyes and feature casting and by these
signs as well as by the description eugene
drummond had given of him carlisle im-
mediately recognized him as henry galt
the chief trader who had been left in charge
of the post awaiting his taking it over

  son of one of the earlier white adventurers
who had married among the crees drum-
mond had said and now as he advanced
with long stalking strides he spoke a salu-
tation in cree

  welcome factor he greeted respect-
fully glancing the rest over with his black
eyes but seeming not to see any other than
his superior as he glanced you have had
a hard journey i read

  true galt a hard one returned car-
lisle through fire and flood on the rivers
ambush



and storm on the lakes but we are here at
last

  ae you are here and it is good that your
flag should float

  with his own hands galt took the stream-
ing gonfalon from the stern of the canoe
it was soiled with river water ripped by
snags scorched from the breath of forest
fire but these scars on the silk but lent it
greater prestige proudly the chief trader
carried it into the stockade ground and
ordered the post banner lowered quickly
he fastened the gonfalon on and bade the
indians haul away on the halyard

as he emerged again the two ban-
ners rose to the staff tip com-
panys flag and factors flag flying
side by side another cheer rang from the
palisade and as galt waved his hand the
guns up-pointed and blazed in salute

  factor spoke the chief trader in the
oratorical manner of his mothers people
i hand you over the post

  carlisle drew himself up proudly upon the
shore the flesh wound in his leg had
practically healed he stood straight and
strong

  i take it from good hands galt he ac-
cepted you i choose to retain as my
chief trader eugene drummond is my
brigade leader and it is news of drummond
i want to hear now have you seen any-
thing of him

  three days ago drummond came he
and other hudsons bay men i did not know
as prisoners among the crews of wayne the
free-trader i had orders not to bother
anybody till you came i knew something
had gone wrong but i obeyed my orders
an exclamation of joy burst from joan
she seized carlisles arm with a little
hysterical laugh though the tears were in
her eyes

  he is here paul-he is here she ex-
ulted richelieu didnt catch him after
all but i was so fearful even though you
were so sure

  yes its good news for you smiled
carlisle i thought richelieu could hardly
match him for woodcraft and richelieu
himself galt addressing his chief trader
again what about him

  four days ago the northwester came
answered galt pointing where a scarce half-
mile away richelieus post flying the north-
west flag showed vaguely in the deepening

dusk in june he took the sturgeon lake
brigades down to grande portage with furs
now he comes with the winter supplies

  i know carlisle laughed grimly i
met him myself at grande portage also on
the way into the pays den haut and he
arrived first eh a day ahead you hear
that joan your father gave richelieu
the slip by leaving the river as i imagined
yes yes but take me to him at once
joan pleaded you know he thinks im
dead

  in a moment assented carlisle galt
order the men of the post to stand to their
arms in case of trouble and you yourself go
on and give the peace sign at fort wayne
ill take my crew as bodyguard although i
dont suppose that is hardly necessary
ha-you father andrews like an un-
grateful boy i was almost forgetting you
go on inside father and take the freedom
of cumberland house till i come back
no paul ill go with you decided the
priest i like to be by your side in case of
trouble to add my influence to your own
all right then father go ahead galt
waynes post stood as close to cumber-
land house as richelieus it too was less
than half a mile away although close as the
posts were together it was no mystery that
carlisle had never seen joan till he set eyes
on her at grande portage

  it was many years since he was here with
thompson and wayne at that time was es-
tablishing other posts on the saskatche-
wans branches in territory far removed
from pine island lake his pine island
lake post only a traders cabin in the be-
ginning had grown as his trade grew and he
had added to it piece by piece warehouse
fur house spacious dwelling-house all of
logs till his independent post under the
free-trade flag was as large as that of either
the hudsons bay companys or the north-
westers

  only lately had he deemed it necessary to
protect it in any material sense increasing
friction with both companies compelling
the erection of the palisade against which
galt now hammered

  whos that demanded the gatekeeper
peering through the gloom you galt
what dye want

  but galt his open palm held out in the
peace sign was forestalled by the eager
excited joan

adventure

she commanded peremptorily its joan
i want my father these men are friends
open quickly

  like a man who sees the dead arise the
gatekeeper obeyed and joan brushed
rapidly past him rushing at the head of the
others leading them through the yard
toward the dwelling-house

  the rough benches upon the long veranda
across the house front were empty but the
door stood open a yellow square of lamp-
light eddied through and through with blue
tobacco smoke and in the frame of the door-
way as in a painted picture they could see a
group of men inside wayne mason and
others lounging in chairs about a big table
confefring over papers smoking long black
pipes

  joan sprang over the veranda and framed
herself in the doorway

  carlisle at her shoulder saw the faces of
the men inside distorted by a colossal amaze-
ment incredulity and darkened by the sud-
den shadow of superstition which their wil-
derness natures could never wholly flout
he saw masons brown-bearded long-
jawed face tilted back the cigar poised in
his hand his yellowed teeth jarred apart
not in triumphant grin as he had seen it
once before but in speechless gape

  wayne himself his cigar dropping on to
the table had risen from his chair to his great
height his features as impassive as carved
mahogany but his fawn-green eyes blazing
like molten disks such a look in any liv-
ing eyes carlisle had never seen it ap-
proached most nearly the vision of the seer
the prophet the vision that seems to pierce
the gray rime of earthly things and behold
the secret realms of another world

  verna verna he articulated in a
whisper

  no no father i am not my mothers
ghost declared joan crying full-voiced
leaping full-blooded across the floor i
am joan and i am not at the bottom of
rapide des boisfranc oh my dear-my
dear im sorry ive made you grieve

  she was in his arms impulsive palpitant
moving her wheaten hair mingled with his
brown curls her cheek pressing his like a
rose petal lying upon an autumn-browned
leaf abruptly waynes grim strength
went from him he trembled like the slim
poplars on the wnd-blown saskatchewan
hills and sagged back into his chair his
daughter on his knee

  by the doom girl-by-the-doom
was all he could mutter

  see im a prisoner of war father she
laughed gaily and ive come for ex-
change youre to give paul his twenty-
five men in place of me am i not worth it
besides ive promised him you would
paul-paul stammered wayne in be-
wilderment who-

then his eyes followed joans
laughing ones to rest upon carlisle
gazing down the table length upon
him though the factor and the rest had
entered on joans heels wayne saw him for
the first time

  he had seen nothing before but the femi-
nine vision of his dead living again in his
daughters image and now he leaped vio-
lently to his feet once more pushing joan
aside into his chair as he leaped

  carlisle saw that his eyes had their earthly
focus back bitter implacable savage and
in them he faced the terrible lightning-
like blaze of passion he knew so well

  you carlisle choked wayne you
dragged my girl by the brink of hell through
those rapids and you dare to come and
stand in my post afterward-you cursed
spit of your drunken english father

  stop right there waynewarned car-
lisle a wave of red anger surging over his
own face for your daughters sake ive
taken a good deal of defiance from you
for her sake maybe ill take a lot more i
cant say but dont touch my fathers
honor with that reckless tongue of yours
touch his honor ill touch his very
bones in his grave and make them writhe in
shame you saw her there in the doorway
-joan that was verna-her mother-
all rose and golden

  that was how i saw her last the day of
major butlers raid on the wyoming the
day his rangers-the cursed lusting hounds
-came by under captain charles carlisle
and carlisle-the vilest hound of them all-
struck her down in my own house while i
was away

  you lie wayne you lie abominably
devilishly none but armed men were
killed in that raid

  so the ignorant tale-makers tell but we
who went through the fire and slaughter
know better we who lost our homes and
our loved ones have memories that nothing
can efface
ambush



  andrews andrews groaned carlisle
his face whitened to an ashy shade under
his bronze tell him he lies you knew my
father you were his friend and my
guardian tell him he lies

  may god forgive me paul but i cant
murmured the priest catching him by the
arm i know nothing but what wayne
has said and that the raid was made in
liquor liquored men are madmen and
their brains do not know what their hands
are doing

 and you knew andrews and you
never told me but high heaven he was
my father my father

  reiterating the words carlisle stood
gazing wildly across the table at joan star-
ing into a face as pale as his own into eyes
as wide-set with anguish

  and you joan you knew- he began
only the-the-truth paul joan cried
my father never told me whose hand was
in it

  there was no need snarled wayne no
need till now am i a liar then carlisle
if you think so go and ask richelieu i
have no love for him at this late date but he
was once our friend for he was as dashing
an officer as one would find anywhere in
those days

  simon richelieu was a nineteen-year-old
lieutenant then officering what local force
we had and he was the one who took me
home and showed me the crumpled bleed-
ing breathless thing that war makes of
woman and a few hours before i had
left her all rose and golden by heaven
go and ask richelieu i tell you he saw
i-will-not panted carlisle in a pas-
sion of despair one word of richelieus
corroboration and i would kill him

  by the doom you hold a tarnished
honor brightly its well charlie carlisle
fell on the wyoming it would have been
better for yourself if you had never lived
when i drifted north from my homeless
valley with my girl of four i swore an oath
against the carlisle breed and by the grave
that lies southward on wyoming waters i
will keep it now go back to your post
carlisle joans word is mine mason
will hand you over your twenty-five men
the petrified missourian sprang into life
again but the factor did not move he re-
mained staring stupidly at joan till the
priest drew him toward the door missowa
waseyawin and the four middlemen crossed

the veranda ahead like gliding shadows and
like gliding shadows they mingled in the
yard with masons muster of the aston-
ished hudsons bay prisoners-drummond
lewis garry lea hampton jarvis wells
the james bay crees ojibways chippewas

  but of these carlisle took no note he
walked unseeing urged by the priests hand
across the dark yard

  andrews he burst out as they passed
through the gate did my father know the
district he was raiding

  yes paul

  the people

  yes

  the house

  yes

  oh my god-her

  yes i cant lie to you you know i
cant

  did my father love her he blurted
harshly for heavens sake tell me if he
loved her

  yes he loved her declared andrews in
a broken voice that much i know
when your mother died in the niagara post
paul his was a lonely life he loved verna
miller aye and so did the stripling
richelieu though wayne won her from
them both

  like lightning the significance of andrews
words flashed home to carlisle as he stum-
bled along the rough shore of pine island
lake toward cumberland house before
him was more than the competition of three
rival trading companies more than the
essay at empire of three rival corporations

  he was plunged into the tense struggle of
souls in combat all the wrongs of another
generation crying for their righting with
the very spirits of the dead arising from the
grave to claim that righting

chapter vii

trade war

cjitting around the counter of galts
 trading-room at morning the hud-
sons bay officers leaped swiftly to their
feet as carlisle came in all the sleepless
night he had shut himself up in his council-
room and now they hung upon his decision
concerning the course to be pursued against
northwesters and free-traders alike

  is it war factor they chorused
eagerly


adventure

  the marks of sleeplessness and inner
conflict showed upon carlisle pallor of skin
under his bronze dark circles around his
eyes a weariness in the gray eyes them-
selves but he nodded with his grim smile

  its war he announced perhaps in
all its bitter phases but a trade war first of
all it starts today this morning on the
minute and ive work cut out for each of
you to do

  a murmur of approbation stirred the
group it was what they hungered for
action strategy blows no doubt in the
end

  carlisle took a map from his pocket and
spread it open on the counter

  look he urged pointing get the sit-
uation fixed in your minds richelieus
post was the first post on sturgeon lake
tom and joe frobisher built it in 
and it was built in defiance of the hudsons
bay companys charter

  that it has passed since the amalga-
mation of the montreal traders as the north-
west company into richelieus hands does
not alter that fact its trading where the
hudsons bay company alone has the right
to trade sam hearne came up the church-
ill in  and masked it with this post
fort cumberland but competition hasnt
killed it-yet

  then years after wayne buffaloed his
way in-a second poacher now men
this cumberland district is the district of
the west who holds the cumberland
district holds the saskatchewan and who
holds the saskatchewan holds the west
you understand me

  oui nodded drummond emphatically
speaking for them all dey understand dat
all right

  so did our sleeping overlords on james
bay when they woke up carlisle went on
thats why they sent hearne up here
thats why they hurried other men in to
build other forts a perfect network of them
from hudsons bay to the rockies from
athabasca lake to the headwaters of the
missouri

  those forts will hold the west only if
cumberland house holds sturgeon lake
because you see the saskatchewan is the
great highway from the rockies and stur-
geon lake commands the water lanes to it
jn the east the west and the north theres
the point its the connection of the north-
ern lakes and rivers here with the church-

ill river that gives this place its strategic
importance

  losh yes factor spoke garry and
what wass it you would be asking us to do

  ill tell you in a moment i just want
to emphasize the danger you know the
strength of the northwesters and i can tell
you in all confidence that the government
of canada is pitted through and through
with northwest adherents where they
are not actually shareholders in the com-
pany they are in close relationship with
shareholders

  the hudsons bay company is powerful
in the government ranks in england but
it is the northwest company which wields
that power here if we lose our grip the
hudsons bay company may as well sur-
render its charter

  the teevil exclaimed lea astounded
while all the men suddenly smitten by the
magnitude of their undertaking exchanged
glances of wonder

  into the hands of the northwesters it
will go carlisle declared and without
our opposition in the field they will not be
long in swallowing up the free-traders

  yer dont mean to sy factor that the
northwesters  stand supreme do ye
burst out jarvis the cockney clerk
blimey if the men thats fought under the
h b c flag so long could stand that ye
know and selp me wot is the territory
of our charter aynt it all the ground
drained by the rivers wot run into hudsons
by

  yes smiled the factor but that ter-
ritory is tremendously big and vague and
its boundaries have never been properly
defined i have private information that
the northwesters will soon send an expedi-
tion over the rockies to the pacific the
headwaters of the saskatchewan are by no
means the limits of their ambitions and
besides the free-trade movement is to be
feared as much as the northwest advance

  you know yourselves that wayne has
independent traders planted all over the
west in his different posts if both the
hudsons bay and northwest companies
go down in a death-grapple the free-traders
will step in and gather all the spoils of the
west three strong companies are reach-
ing out for it and i tell you in all serious-
ness men that two of those companies
have to be smashed before another sum-
mer
ambush



  then to the dowl wi the free-traders
and the northwesters alike cried hampton
belligerently our own territory be given
us by old charter us corned out here under
our companys flag an we bant going to
see un fall i can assure e youm counting
on we i reckon factor to hold un feet while
youm breaking un heads ope

  thats it hampton laughed carlisle
you five men must hold my lines of com-
munication thats why i brought you in
our posts in the norway house and york
districts have complete control that
makes everything safe from lake winnipeg
to hudsons bay but between here and
lake winnipeg you must hold the lines as

i	say

  galt and drummond i keep by me of
course lea goes to the nepowin lewis to
the pas garry to moose lake hampton to
chimawawin jarvis to grand rapids you
will keep your territory clear of interlopers
pay any price to get its trade and await
further orders from me

  the summer ship from england will
reach james bay any day now and the
moment she arrives york boats are coming
up the hayes river from york factory with
reserve supplies of food and trade goods
you will hold these boats in relays at grand
rapids chimawawin and the pas until i
send for them thats all men you
start at once galt and drummond will
pick you out small canoes outfits and
paddlers

in five minutes the fleet was
afloat no man other than those
carlisle had addressed had been told
its mission or its destination but conjecture
ran rife through cumberland house the
whites hazarded shrewd guesses concerning
the factors plans while the indian tribes
herded on the shore jabbering and pointing
at the canoes till they disappeared from
the doorway of galts trading-room carlisle
watched them go and he had no misgivings
as he watched

  he knew his men their abilities limita-
tions merits and demerits as he knew his
own and even after they were gone he saw
them still on his mental vision-garry the
man of inverness with his short broad body
flaming red beard and whimsical face lea
the cromarty youth with the brown hand-
someness of the tall young highlander
hampton ruddy fleshy with his atmos-


phere of the freshly-turned peat soil and
his devon speech jarvis a bunch of wires
and nerves reeling off his cockney slang
and lewis aged mountainous-framed gray-
haired and gray-bearded craggy-featured
as the hebrides he hailed from

  they were all picked men tried in the
companys service carlisle had chosen
them out of many on the bay and he knew
they would not fail him wells the south-
of-england stripling he had chosen for a
different kind of work that of secret service
and him he now sent out in another direc-
tion

  his destination was the seepanock chan-
nel a short water lane connecting the
saskatchewan and its tributary the carrot
where they flowed almost parallel for a
space his mission was to establish a
winter camp there and scout along it to
prevent the possible attempt of down-com-
ing brigades of rival traders to avoid pine
island lake and reach the saskatchewan
again far to the east of it

  as the crowd on the shore broke up with
the passing of the canoes carlisle wheeled
back to galts counter

  let me see your day-book galt he
requested

  he turned up the last entered page the
page of recent trade and scanned the entries
with a practised eye

  upon the yellow leaves of the well-
thumbed book the entries ran thus

son-of-the-stars  beaver skins 

amiska  skunk  skins 

running moose  common red

fox  skin 

 otter  skins 

makwa  prime red fox  skins 

 cross do  skins 

 black do skins 

  the unit value was a beaver skin chosen
as something concrete that the indian mind
could comprehend in default of mathematics
and currency tokens and though the unit
fluctuated in value with different posts it
was worth on the average fifty cents to
the indian his more valuable pelts were
simply his beaver skin multiplied as many
times as the post trader decreed

  in the entries carlisle gazed upon he
found few of the costlier skins in fact few
of any kind of skins and he knew the reason
these were but the feelers the first light skins
of barter ever slow to bargain and anx-
ious to obtain the greatest price for their


adventure

catch the hunters delayed awaiting the
coming of the new factor in the hope that
they might profit more

  but the amount of that profit they had
never imagined even in their rosiest dreams
for now carlisle tapped the day-book and
gave galt the chief trader a hitherto un-
heard-of schedule of prices

  double it galt he ordered one
beaver is worth two skins send out the
word among our indians and see that some
of our indians mingle with waynes and
richelieus to carry the news

  immediately the word went out and trade
began the indians swarmed into the yard
and covered the trading-room floor tall
black-eyed raven-haired smoky-skinned
they stood gaunt of waist and sinewy of
limb clad only in deerskin trousers and
moccasins galt took a bag of trade bullets
to represent the beaver skins which they
comprehended

  they laid down what they had brought
galt gave them its estimated value in trade
bullets they traded the bullets back to
galt for whatever supplies they needed
thus in wilderness currency they turned
fox mink beaver and other skins into flour
sugar bacon and other commodities

  nor do i measure my flour and sugar
with my fingers inside the cup as the north-
westers and free-traders do galt en-
couraged them in their own language

  neither do i take more of your bullets
than the value says and i write no
larger debt against you in the books than
the just debt

  the trade grew brisk and not with the
hudsons bay companys indians alone
but with the tribes the free-traders and
northwesters had won to their allegiance
cotameg the chippewa in carlisles service
and others visited the teepees about waynes
and richelieus posts dropping news that
sent the occupants of those teepees stalking
over to cumberland house

  at richelieus post cotameg detached
himself from all the rest and performed
another and unrehearsed act by a circuit-
ous route he worked round to the rear of the
post and there unmarked by any one on the
cumberland house side signaled to a man
on the palisades above in a moment the
gate opened and richelieu himself ap-
peared

  what is it cotameg he whispered
quick it is broad daylight you must

remember and it would not do for us to be
seen mon dieu no

  he has sent men to the nepowin the
pas moose lake chimawawin and grand
rapids the chippewa spoke rapidly
there is food and trade stuff coming up
from james bay it will stay at the river
posts till he sends for it no one was to
know but i was hidden in the loft while they
talked and i heard

  	bon exclaimed richelieu that is
all eh

  he has made two beaver the price of one
beaver

  ciel a trade war then come to me day
by day cotameg there will be things i
must know voila go back swiftly and
secretly

  nor was wayne long in hearing the news
from his own indians and that very morn-
ing he met the hudsons bay companys
challenge by advancing the beaver unit
another skin in the afternoon richelieu
was compelled to make it four skins and
that night carlisle raised it to five

thereafter it was a colossal
game of poker with beaver skins for
chips and no limit but the topaz sky
overhead like the northland princes they
were the three played the game with mad
persistence never for an instant night or
day did trade slacken for to slacken was to
lose

  carlisle galt and drummond worked in
turn behind the counter while the indians
they dealt with traded and slept in relays or
slept not at all such profit the tribes well
knew could not last long they availed
themselves while they might

  never had the stoic hunters been moved
to such excitement they stalked no more
but ran violently from post to post frantic
for the highest bid around waynes or
richelieus counter they would be swarm-
ing trading greedily when a fellow tribes-
man would rush in jabbering and away
they would surge to cumberland house
where beaver was worth another skin for
never before had the northland known the
like never before had the poverty-ridden
crees been possessed of so much wealth or
reveled in so much luxury

  now their costlier pelts came out bear
lynx wolf wolverine ermine otter marten
fisher the prime red fox crosses silvers
blacks carlisle galt and drummond
ambush



were pressed harder than ever toiling in a
sweat through the sweltering august days

  the trading-room was a-reek with the odor
of fur the teepees of the hunters were piled
with debt they carried away from the store
pyramided with flour sugar tea tobacco
baconbeans the hunters squaws came
likewise and had their lords clutter them up
with soap ribbon calico velvet thimbles
mirrors beads silk handkerchiefs balmoral
skirts huckaback towels and a hundred
other useless things gay as their squaws
these lords went about in wincy shirts with
castor-oil rubbed on their heads gloating
over the new capotes laid by for colder
weather proud of their bright axes knives
brass-bound trade guns and ammunition

  much of the food they wasted in gorging
feasts much of the ammunition they
foolishly fired at marks but in indian
logic what did it matter by the end of
the first mad week carlisle supreme in the
field had hammered the price of beaver to
thirty skins

  also by the end of that mad week cum-
berland house was stripped of every article
of trade goods every pound of provisions
so too were the other posts and the factor
congratulated himself and his men he had
won his game it was what he aimed at
too late wayne had awakened to the cost
of playing northern poker

  the fort was out of farinaceous food and
he was forced to send messengers off into
the forest for others of his independent
posts to come to his aid with enough sup-
plies to tide him over the winter riche-
lieu however sent no messengers forth
he looked at the empty shelves of his post
shrugged his shoulders and awaited car-
lisles next move

  it was saturday night and the factor
galt and drummond with the volunteer
help of andrews balanced up the companys
books besides forcing the hands of their
competitors in the matter of supplies they
had corrtered the bulk of the furs galts
fur-room was crammed with pelts

  it was true that they had paid five times
too much for some of the beaver and other
cheaper pelts but they would make up that
loss on the priceless skins like the black and
silver foxes which all traders undervalued
for the indians more than that they had
secured the trade and the trade in the
indian mind was the psychological thing

  but are you sure galt asked carlisle

when they finished that all our indians
are in none who got debt are missing off
the books

  only old white loon his two sons
nephew and cousin answered galt they
all lived in one family and theyre all just
nicely over the smallpox i got word of
their coming in and stopped them up the
shore by carcajou cove they went into
camp there i made them throw away
their furs but gave them value for them

  i dumped new clothes outfits supplies
and everything for them on the shore and
told them to strip and leave the old camp
naked they walked out bare as babes
new-born and took the fresh stuff and then
i sent them back on their trap lines
thats good-you did right galt
commended carlisle we want no infec-
tion here and there are no others
no

  then well close up and have a nights
sleep

 ba gar yes yawned drummond
im dozin in ma stride me-snorin ovaire
de beaver packs everywere bon soir
messieurs

  he lurched off staggering for sleep and
the others rose and followed

  im glad you finished up before sunday
paul observed andrews as they passed
up-stairs in the factors house

  oh yesfather as you know most of
the factors go on just the same with their
trading or routing of the brigades but i be-
lieve in resting as far as possible one day
in seven see you in the morning andrews
and hope ill be up in time for your service

sunday morning broke in a white
lake fog dank and woolly but when
carlisle stepped out of his house he
saw the sun sluicing away the fog with a
flood of gold he beheld the ordered march
of the rollers white wave-crest behind white
wave-crest as far as the eye could reach
running beneath the fog drift and the tops
of the pine-clad islands lifting starkly above

  andrews was already on the shore taking
his stand upon a huge rock that rose up like
a giant altar and whites and indians from
all three posts were blackening the beach
the bronzed roughly-clothed woodsmen
the smoky savages the squaws decked in all
their finery with new velvet moss-bags for
their wailing papooses

  on this day of truce in their trade war the


adventure

rival companies met on a common ground
of worship some out of genuine desire
others out of curiosity more out of sheer
idleness

  richelieu himself arrived with his black
beard newly trimmed and his resplendent
uniform cleaned and polished despite the
peaceful appearance of things he had a
bodyguard along and he chose his place on
the other side of the throng from carlisle
giving him with exaggerated courtesy his
ramrod bow from the hips while the sar-
donic laugh of the devil lurked in his black
beard

  for wayne or joan carlisle looked in
vain and a disconcerting qualm disturbed
him inwardly all the busy week he had
had no glimpse of her and today he had
hoped-but yonder was the flash of a
womans dress flitting over from fort
wayne he stared and his heart leaped
it was joan and she was coming alone
gone were her trail garments the gray
wool canoe skirt and the mosquito veil

  she walked bareheaded a jewel at her
throat clad in a clinging silk dress of cham-
pagne color with new snow-white doeskin
half moccasins peeping from underneath
a moment he drank in the vision of her all
unflawed fairness in the full blaze of the sun
all rose and golden as wayne had said of her
mother before she sat down upon a boulder
on the outskirts of the crowd

  with prayer and oration in cree the brief
service went on andrews towering in his
black cassock upon the rock altar above his
motley congregation his strong voice sound-
ing sonorously from the water-line to the
rim of the large gathering to the cadences
of the waves breaking upon the beach and
the breezes playing through the pines they
sang their hymns chanting in many lan-
guages crying to their divers gods

  then with a benediction andrews dis-
missed them and the adherents of each post
began to gravitate slowly toward their own
precincts

  carlisle watching saw that joan did not
go back directly as if loath to leave the
fresh sweetness of the morning she slipped
from the crowd and loitered up one of the
forest aisles between cumberland house
and fort wayne for a moment he hesi-
tated made as if to follow andrews inside
the stockade and then turned off up the
ferny avenue joan had taken

  a little farther on he caught sight of her

wandering amid the jumble of rock ridges
and grassy hills that fringed the woodland
all the hollows were splashed with the hue
of berries red raspberries golden goose-
berries blueberries the profligate wild black
currants all the hills were ablaze with
flowers waves of bluebells tangles of wild
pink roses patches of vivid lilies a largess of
yellow daisies running riot everywhere

  joan was idling along bending here and
there with the supple ease of the wilderness
trained gathering what pleased her fancy
but at the sound of carlisles feet in the
briers she whirled swiftly poised at her
full height in the fashion she had inherited
from her father

  in a flash carlisle sensed the change in
her she was the same yet not the same
woman as before her fathers revelation the
night of their arrival on sturgeon lake

  that revelation seemed to have thrown
her back on herself stamped her more def-
initely as a wayne in the very accentu-
ation of her fathers mannerism carlisle read
a strengthening of her loyalty to that father
and deep loyalty to wayne could mean
nothing but deep antagonism to him

  with something of the same feeling he had
experienced when he feared she was going
to be absent from the congregation of the
pine island lake shore he stopped before
her without a greeting searching her face
with his eyes

  paul paul she cried peremptorily
first to break silence who  gave you
leave to follow me here

  nobody but i took it he answered
boldly i took it as men must always
take the things they want in this northland
but you had no right

  ah but i have the right a wood
nymph came to me one night on the winni-
peg river and gave me that right do you
remember

  no i dont remember

  joan you mean you dont choose to
remember

  well then-i dont choose to remember

       face to face with him she stood
defiant imperious her arms full of
the gathered wild flowers but sham-
ing the flowers in all their fairness far
sweeter to carlisle than the honeyed blos-
soms far more haunting than the languor-
ous perfume they breathed

  but you must joan he cried almost
ambush



fiercely you dont hate me in spite
of all you dont hate me

  there youre wrong she flashed i
do hate you i hate you with my fathers
hatred of your father with his eternal loath-
ing of a carlisle

  he leaned over till his eyes were close to
hers till he could catch every flicker of
expression every shade of emotion

  with his hatred he admitted trium-
phantly but not -with your own great
heavens joan i showed my feeling in the
rapide des boisfranc and you showed me
yours in the teepee in the forest when you
thought i was asleep no - no-dont
say you didnt you cant deceive me i
wont take a thousand denials youre
acting-acting a lie for your fathers sake
by the god of the northmen girl you care
no no no i dont

  he laid his palms on the arms that hugged
the bunch of tangled flowers

  you care he repeated chokingly

 no paul i-

   the rest was lost in the swift sliding of his
palms to her shoulders and the swifter
crushing of herself against his great frame

  stop paul stop she implored her face
like a wild flower all sprayed with crimson
among the crushed roses the blood of
my mother stands between and my
father forbade me even to meet you on the
trail let me go if any of his men
should come by and see
jmfreyd see the truth for youre living a
liephe passionately persisted tell me
its a lie

  his caress was the elemental soul-shaking
caress that had swayed her in the caldron
of the rapids and with a little cry joan
involuntarily tightened one arm upon his
shoulders

  yes i lie-i do she panted and i
shall go on lying-for my fathers sake for
my dead mothers sake i shall hate you
day by day let me go here take the
flowers the bluebells for my eyes the daisies
for my hair as my father says

  theyre all youll ever have of me
take them and oh paul no matter how
i hate you how i hurt you remember
that i lie there there my god what
have i said-and done

  she had forced the crushed flowers into
his arms and writhing free darted through
the saskatoon bushes into the fringe of trees
that straggled round to fort wayne

  a radiant fight on his features carlisle
looked down at the crushed tangled armful
of flowers she had left him his vision was
blurred and he seemed to-see them as her
palpitant self her longings crushed like the
bruised petals upon her vow of parental
devotion he held the blooms tight as he
moved away along the grassy hills through
the hollows and over the brake of fern to
cumberland house and continually his
eyes strayed to his fragrant burden

  lounging in the gateway of the stockade
galt and drummond saw him coming and
stared their surprise

  ba gar wats dat he be got henry
demanded the brigade leader

  flowers of the hills replied the keen-
eyed half-breed

  certainemenl dats right ha factor

momin eh

  carlisle looked up startled

  oh- ah- yes eugene he returned

  well when he comes in send him to me

oui assured drummond soons i be
set eyes on hees canoe

  the factor passed on through the gate
and up to his house and the moment his
back disappeared eugene grasped the half-
breed chief trader by the arm

  you be see it galt he chuckled

  no confessed galt whose sight had
failed him for once see what

enigmatically for sure he peeck dem an

chapter viii

the price of a kiss

a t the moment eugene drummond
was speaking of cotameg as having
gone on the lake the chippewas canoe was
turning into carcajou cove up the pine


adventure

island lake shore not a great distance
from richelieus post as cotameg softly
beached his craft over the rough shingle the
northwest leader stepped out of the tree
with a companion a slim smooth-cheeked
frenchman with a pointed mustache and a
large hawk nose

  he is here dentaire observed riche-
lieu with satisfaction par dieu never
failing never late-a spy of spies com-
ment

  yes but what are you thinking of
asked dentaire

  wait and see what i am thinking of
dentaire laughed richelieu ha cota-
meg what fable did you give this morning
i am seeking whitefish replied cota-
meg without the trace of a grin and it will
not do for me to be too long away also
i must not go back without some fish
all right cotameg go on through the
woods to the post robouix will give you
money for your work also rum since it is a
slack day and nothing to do

  with alacrity the chippewa spy sped off
through the trees and the instant he was
gone richelieu seized upon the limp dun-
nage sack in the canoe the sack which con-
tained his meager gear

  now dentaire you will see what use i
make of this trbs vite he announced

  he shook the contents of the dunnage
sack out into the underbrush and with the
empty bag over his arm led the way a little
distance round the curve of the cove and
through the woods three hundred yards
in the deserted camp of white loon the
smallpox-ridden indian and his relatives
opened out before them and dentaire sud-
denly realized where he was being led

  bon dieu he ejaculated and crossed
himself in the trail

  diablement dentaire ridiculed riche-
lieu are you afraid of an old teepee

  bon dieu repeated dentaire shiver-
ing teepees which chill ones heart
bah shrugged richelieu they
dont chill my heart

  he walked fearlessly through the ashes
of the camp-fire kicking aside discarded
cooking utensils and other paraphernalia
and peered into the opening of the torn
skins that covered the teepee poles

  his examination seemed to satisfy him
for hanging the sack open-mouthed upon
one of the poles he picked up a long stick
and began to fork into it things from the

dark interior worn moccasins soiled trou-
sers of buckskin the dirty parfltches or bed-
rolls while dentaire staring at him with
horrified eyes trembled and crossed himself
and called incessantly on providence

  mort rouge the red death the indians
call it grinned richelieu as he pulled the
bag down by the drawstrings in its mouth
jerked the strings tight and started to drag
it behind him but never fear dentaire
this is not for you though providence
would no doubt defend you from the plague
with all that beseeching it is for the men
of the hudsons bay

  and bon dieu does cotameg know
quavered dentaire taking frantic care to
keep ahead all the way back to the cove

  no you fool cotameg knows nothing
about it if he did he would be like you
del he would run or drop the bag in the
lake since he knows nothing he will go
back and throw the bag down as usual in
cumberland house-like i do now
with a tug and swing on the drawstrings
richelieu tossed the dunnage sack care-
lessly into the canoe bow

  with never a touch of my hands he
boasted but calm yourself dentaire
and quit your crossing i think i hear cot-
ameg coming back see that you give no
suspicion to him

  shortly the chippewa appeared walking
more noisily with less of his stony stoicism
what of the rum with which robouix un-
der richelieus instructions had plied him
he had half a dozen whitefish in his hands
and grinning he held them out

  robouixs men caught many today he
explained and i have wasted time these
will save me time

  yes richelieu nodded take them
quickly they will not starve today at
cumberland house and when the factor
sends for his supplies do not fail to give me
word or sign

  cotameg threw the whitefish into the
stern of his canoe paddled out of carcajou
cove and swung back to cumberland
house he had been absent the greater
part of the morning several times car-
lisle had asked drummond if he had re-
turned and now as his craft came in sight
the brigade leader went up to the factors
house

de chippewa be cornin he informed
all right eugene bring me smoking
pine to the beach i am sending the two of
ambush



them to the pas for food stuffs i dont
like the post to be too long on a straight
meat diet it breeds disease

when eugene found smoking
pine carlisle followed them down
to the shorej where the chippewa
was edging in his canoe

  you neednt trouble to land cotameg
the factor told him your being away
has made your start late step in smoking
pine no-keep the fish theyll make
your first meal for youll have to feed your-
selves on the way go to the pas tell
lewis to send on the york boats from his
post if the boats arent there wait for
them and see that there is no delay on the
river

  though the rum was in his veins cota-
meg had wisdom enough to show no con-
cern he grunted comprehendingly and
dipped his paddle in time with smoking
pines as the canoe glided off but a mile or
two upon his way he stopped for the noon
meal just near one of the secret rendezvous
that he and richelieu had picked upon to
obviate the risk of his visiting the north-
west post too often

  there they roasted some of the fish on
sticks and there cotameg lagged behind
smoking pine a moment before he stalked
down to the canoe to reembark

  with his knife he blazed a white space
upon a tree trunk in the secret rendezvous
and with a piece of charcoal from the fire
smudged on it the sign for richelieu-a
crude drawing of a full flour sack labeled
h b c

  nor was the departure of cotameg and
smoking pine the only departure from
cumberland house that day after the
mid-day meal seemingly without fore-
thought without any definite plan the in-
dian hunters took down the medicine bags
from the rear of their teepees and the
squaws struck the tents

  the tribes round richelieus post and
fort wayne perceived the exodus and fol-
lowed suit the littered camp-grounds be-
came a chaos andabedlam of bucks squaws
children and dogs but finally the ruck was
straightened out the baggage bundled and
apportioned the papooses and curs sorted
and the pilgrimage began

  their destinations were many the up-
saskatchewan country the down-saskatch-
ewan the sturgeon river the carrot river

the eastern and western arms of sturgeon
lake lakes namew amisk goose atha-
puscow

  some went afoot on the forest trails their
worldly goods piled upon their shoulders and
their dogs back-packed with forty pounds
apiece others traveled by canoe the glis-
tening yellow craft loaded to the gunwales
with heterogeneous dunnage and the dogs
thrust under the thwarts

  the serried hosts of the forest trees swal-
lowed the files of marchers more quickly
than the sweeping phalanxes of the crested
waves could hide the fleets from the door-
way of his house carlisle watched the fa-
miliar sight they were going back these
children of the wilderness to their wilder-
ness crafts to their fish channels caribou
runs and trap lines

  they would travel from fifty to one hun-
dred miles from cumberland house plant-
ing their marten deadfalls their double-
spring fox traps their twitch-up snares for
rabbits through a waste of frost and snow
and he would see none of them again till
christmas

  with a strange sense of loneliness he held
them to the last with his keen eyes till the
straight backs of the hunters the bright
shawls of the squaws the warm yellow of the
birch canoes faded beyond the heaving silver
rollers

  a fortnight passed after their departure
and there was no sign of the york boats at
cumberland house the month of sep-
tember came in and still carlisle felt no un-
easiness for cotameg and smoking pine
had to go down round the great bend of
the saskatchewan beyond the mouth of the
carrot to the pasquia river where the post
of the pas lay in the crotch the pasquia
formed with the saskatchewan

  perhaps the supplies had not reached
lewis when they got there perhaps on
account of pack icc or shifting shoals in
james bay the companys ship had not been
able to get in on schedule and there might
have been delay in sending the york boats
up from york factory

  so the factor waited philosophically liv-
ing like the rest of the men of the post and
the rival posts as well upon a straight meat
diet varied a little by berries from the hills
daily they plied the rifle and the net
bringing in the first fall ducks ptarmigan
whose brown summer feathering was whit-
ening for winter finny prizes from the cool


adventure

deep waters whitefish inconnu silvery
trout as big as salmon sometimes a weighty
sturgeon

  surplus fish especially the whitefish were
dried for winter dog feed and when the
nets yielded nothing the canoes went out at
night with spearmen in the bows bronze
statues posing under the red flares in the iron
baskets above them darting their steel into
the pitchy flame-carmined water where the
startled fish fluked in phosphorescent streaks

  bird life too was flocking for the fall
migration plover snipe terns long-billed
marsh wrens yellow-headed blackbirds
red-winged blackbirds sora rails filled the
reedy labyrinths wood duck ruddy duck
grebes loons coots mallards black duck
covered the weedy channels while day by
day the rafts of gadwall pintail teal
scaups scoters redheads canvasbacks grew
greater and greater

  then down drove the wedges of - wild
geese true harbingers of coming winter
the canadas from hudsons bay the wavies
from unknown islands of the arctic every
day from sunrise to sunset the guns of the
indian goose hunters talked on the lonely
shores and by the hundreds they brought
them in to be eaten fresh or salted down in
barrels for winter use

  but white men quickly sicken of flesh
alone and white women more quickly than
men and often carlisle wondered how joan
was faring on the savage diet he had not
seen her since the sunday morning she had
fled from him her flowers were withered
and dead but he looked in vain for another
meeting all the week days there was
practically no communication between the
posts and on sundays she never came any
more to andrews mixed services on the
lake shore

  he wondered if she were ill and censured
himself for pressing the trade war so bit-
terly would wayne perhaps save some
staple provisions for such an emergency
but on second thought he knew wayne was
not the man to hedge in a fight she would
be living on the post diet and he feared it
did not agree

  the idea harassed him continually set
him searching at nights for overlooked food
among the shelves of his quarters till one
night he came across his gear bag thrown
aside and forgotten since he had established
himself at the post

  in its bottom his groping fingers felt a

bundle which he did not recognize at first
but as he unrolled the oilcloth in which
it was wrapped he suddenly remembered
about it it was a small reserve of pro-
visions stowed away there when he left
moose factory in case of accident or emer-
gency on the trip to cumberland house

  eagerly he spread out its contents and
eyed the articles with satisfaction-a tiny
bag of flour the same of meal a tin of
salted butter a package of raisins a little
powdered chocolate delicacies for any-
one in the north a boon to joan whether
she was sick or not and who was to see
him if he tossed them by night over the pal-
isades of fort wayne

hastily he wrapped them up
again in strong paper wrote joans
name on the wrapper slipped out of
his house and through the stockade gate

  the moment he left the stockade he
caught it-the first tang of real autumn
that indefinable feel in the air something of
coolness something of dampness a savor of
falling leaves white frost fogs mournful
winds and a world left desolate by fleeting
migrant wings the moon was nearly full
ghost-like gibbous pouring its radiance
over the blackly silhouetted tree-tops upon
pine island lake beneath

  a flux of molten silver carlisle beheld the
waters broken only by the swimming musk-
rats at the apices of their v-shaped ripples
along the shores and by the huge rafts of
ducks huddled black as islands quacking
sleepily in mid-lake shore and open for-
est aisles were bright as day so the factor
edged into the trees and kept the shadows
as he worked round to fort wayne

  velvet-footed on his moccasins he ap-
proached the palisades maintaining a sharp
watch for riflemen who might fire first and
challenge afterward measuring his distance
till he thought he was near enough to throw
as he swung back his arm the creak of the
opening stockade gate froze him in his tracks
and the next instant a womans figure came
flying round the palisades on the trail that
led to the waters edge almost colliding with
him before she could come to a stop

  joan

  paul

  where on earth were you going girl at
this time of night

  hush paul she whispered mur-
dock the gate-keeper or some of the others
ambush



may hear you what on earth are you
doing yourself here under our palisades
teu me where you were going first he
insisted

  i was going to the lake i-i have not
been feeling too well lately

  ha i knew it its the meat diet i
found some other food in my packs and was
going to toss it over for you here it is
he thrust the package into her hands his
eyes full of tender solicitude as they studied
her face in the moonlight a face not so full
of its laughing curves not so rose-fresh in
color as it should be

  youve been sick sicker than youve
admitted he diagnosed

  ive been worrying-thats the main
trouble she told him im all upset
its about my father paul his supplies
he got word back from the independent
posts and none of them can spare anything
theyve had their trade wars too

  of course carlisle exclaimed you
didnt suppose mine was an isolated attempt
did you the hudsons bay companys
making a timed and concerted effort all over
the west to smash competition with one
stroke and the key point of the whole cam-
paign lies right here thats why it pinches
hardest if i fail everything fails

  by heaven joan do you think i carry my
responsibility lightly do you think its easy
for me to starve you to make you suffer but
girl you wont force me to that cruelty will
you tell me if things come to the worst
that youll persuade your father to give in
never paul never she refused pas-
sionately before you break his inde-
pendence youll have to break him-and me
ha you mad girl then if you will face
hunger youll have to let me send you stuff
like that in your hands

  perhaps paul-that is if you have it to
send she smiled enigmatically

  wtiat does that mean is it a riddle
do you promise

  ill give you my promise if you give me
yours

  but theres no necessity for me to
promise are you laughing at me warning

me or-

  he stopped in mid-sentence twisting his
head swiftly at the roar of a wild commo-
tion at cumberland house he caught the
thud of moccasined feet running and the
shrill tenor voice of eugene drummond
pitched on the night

  factor factor he was yelling mon
dieu were you be disappear an gone den
de york boats be on de shore an deres
diable trouble makin fur men fightin de
crews an smoking pine be run for help
factor-factor

here eugene roared carlisle forgetful
of murdock or anybody else im coming
as he whirled about he found joan block-
ing the trail the moonlight glinting on a
pistol in her hand

  stay right where you are paul she
commanded

  joan-your fathers men carlisle ex-
claimed intuitively

  he leaped suddenly making a swift pass
with his hand to grasp her arm but agile as
a fawn she sprang back and evaded him

  paul ill shoot she threatened as
sure as i hold it ill shoot

  the pistol muzzle covered him fairly
daunting deadly for a minute or so
carlisle hesitated searching her eyes for
any sign of uncertainty of yielding but he
read only determination there a will that
matched his own she showed and its an-
tagonism fired him with a sterner resolve
with a lightning movement he launched
himself bodily upon her pistol and all he
had her grasped by the shoulders but the
weapon touched his breast

  paul she cried breathlessly dont

make me-

  then in the crucial moment her will
failed with a little cry of despair she
thrust the weapon back into her pocket
and swept her arms about his neck

  i couldnt she burst out i couldnt
carlisles strong frame trembled from
head to foot for mad moments he knew
nothing there in the trail saw nothing but
the spun-gold hair the amethyst eyes and
the passionate face touched to his under the
moonlight-till through the cloying sweet-
ness of his oblivion rang the raucous clamor
of men fighting on the shore her arms
still clinging he tore himself free and
dashed back toward cumberland house

as he reached the stockade gate out
shot eugene drummond his raven
hair disheveled and streaming his
volatile face ridged in consternation and his
black eyes glinting fire in his excitement

  name of le diable he shouted im
be hunt you everywere factor smokin
pine-


adventure

  i know blurted carlisle guiltily i
heard you come on have you routed
out the men

  mon dieu oui exploded eugene
catching him by the arm some in deir
shirts half-naked some snorin in peeg sleep
an dose york boats crews fightin off tree
taims deir number

  the rest of his frenzied declamation was
lost upon carlisle who tearing his arm free
and distancing eugene was bounding down
to the lake edge in great long strides al-
ready he could see the york boats three in
number sweeping-lined long-prowed eight-
oared crafts so huge as to be capable of
holding one hundred bags of flour

  they lay black as logs along the shore
and over them poised on the gunwales run-
ning along the seats trampling the cargoes
raged and surged a mob of fighting men
even at that distance the factor recognized
the attackers as free-traders waynes men
of the missouri men of the mississippi men
of the red all mingled with his cree and
chippewayan indians

  he saw the brown-bearded long-jawed
mason war-whooping his way through his
opponents and in the center of the melee he
caught a glimpse of wayne towering to his
great height his copper-colored mustache
flashing golden in the moonlight as he
wrenched and struck

  the york boats crews fought back with
the oars and the long poles they had used
for poling up the rapids but waynes force
was too large for their meager numbers
before carlisle could reach the waterline
the free-traders had swarmed over the
york boats from stern to prow pulled
dragged knocked the crews overside into
the shallow water and seized the oars

  then under the factors astounded eyes
another force struck the victors like a
thunderbolt all in a second the shore
thickets gushed men the very rocks of the
earth seemed to spew them one moment
they were not the next moment they were
as if borne up on the oscillations of an earth-
quake or the breath of a tornado north-
westers all outnumbering waynes force as
waynes had outnumbered the york boats
crews

  in hiding from the first their rush timed
to the fraction of a second caught the free-
traders in the moment of disadvantage just
in the act of replacing the oars in the locks
carlisle could see that the northwesters had

a stout cable in their hands stretched taut
as a rod a score of men on either end with
a surge and splash they hurled themselves
through the shallows and like a giant scythe
the taut cable cleared the york boats at one
stroke sweeping the free-traders overside
like manikins from their perch

  in a flash the cable was lashed onto the
leading boat the other boats lashed onto the
first and already the flotilla was being
towed rapidly toward richelieus post as
well as being equipped with a land-gate the
northwest fort boasted a water-gate part
of the stockade extending out over the
water enclosing a little harbor entered
through a heavy log barrier that was raised
by ropes on capstan-like drums inside

  carlisle saw that the water-gate stood
open and that it was richelieus plan to
slide the york boats cargoes and all inside
his palisades he marked the northwest
leader at the head of the trackers pulling
exhorting cursing the clumsy

  name of a name is it a hearse then
and par dieu do not fall over your own
feet quick quick straight ahead and
the sooner the better

  with an imprecation carlisle took a run-
ning leap from the shore drummond galt
smoking pine and the straggle of cumber-
land house men launching after backed up
by the dripping york boats crews he
landed with a geyser-like splash among the
knot of trackers grappling with the cursing
richelieu his feet slipping upon the shelving
rock together they went down in the
shallows rolling and wrenching half a
dozen men fell on top of them the boats
never stopping in their career bumped them
aside and in the scramble carlisles grip was
torn from richelieu

  he found his footing again and staggered
up but as he emerged from the water a fly-
ing oar blade caught him on the side of the
head knocking him half-stunned across
the gunwale of one of the boats in a daze
he felt himself dragged along half in half
out of the water all about him surged
shouting snarling tangles of men black as
demons against the silver moonlight his
own adherents striking and tearing at the
towers on the ropes hacking at the lashing
themselves while the northwesters fended
them off

  occasionally a rifle spat out but at too
close quarters for indiscriminate shooting in
a maze where they hardly discerne friend
ambush



from enemy the hudsons bay men smote
with clubbed rifles pieces of broken oars
rocks knives axes yet despite the weight
of their attack the york boats were sliding
foot by foot toward richelieus water-gate

  within a few hundred feet of it carlisle
pulled himself up once more with a resurge
of strength and cast himself into the fray
knocking men right and left he seized the
last boat by the stem and with all the
mighty power of his body swung it sidewise
toward the shore

  eugene galt he importuned any
of you there-hold the bows

  his idea was to turn the flotilla broadside
on so that it could not enter the water-gate
and thus delay it till more reinforcements
could arrive from cumberland house
without a doubt the maneuver would have
been successful had it not been for the length
of the northwesters cable

  the loose end of it had been seized by
men in the water-gate and whipped round
one of the capstan-like drums inside oth-
ers threw themselves on the bars and with
a wrench and run the flotilla was torn bodily
from the hands of carlisle and his com-
panions and snaked through the water-gate

the heavy log barrier dropped
with a rumble and splash and a
loud cheer burst from the victorious
northwesters within still cheering they
ran to the palisades and the hail of their
bullets began to splat-splat in the shallows
uncomfortably close to carlisle and the rest

  it was madness to crouch there in the
moonlight black targets for guns behind log
walls the hudsons bay men paused only
long enough to hurriedly shoulder their
wounded and disabled and broke into a run
for cumberland house

  as carlisle lurched along in the rear he
could discern the baffled free-traders off
toward fort wayne making for their own
stockade by his great height he marked
wayne among them and close beside wayne
the shimmer of joans dress well he read
her riddle now but her need was not yet
satisfied richelieu had won

  in the trading-room of cumberland
house the panting hudsons bay men let
down their burdens under the candlelight
the lifeless chippewa cotameg shot fairly
through the head two wounded white men of
the post with bullets through their thighs
three men of the york boats crews

with splintered bones in their arms or legs

  hardly a man was there but showed the
marks of the battle cracked heads smashed
knuckles flesh wounds and bruises without
end and as they felt each other over to make
sure there was no more serious hurt father
andrews appeared in the doorway

  roused from sleep by the commotion his
cassock only half-belted on by its cord he
came and at his entrance eugene drum-
mond wiping the blood from his swarthy
face dropped his handkerchief with an
amazed exclamation

  ba gar he whispered hoarsely hees
face-hees face for sure

  andrews in his hurry had forgotten his
mosquito veil and for the first time in
twenty-one years drummond saw his fea-
tures yet he saw them only for an instant
and then only in the semi-obscurity of the
doorway eugenes exclamation struck the
priest like a warning word

  his hand went up and drew close the cowl
of his cassock before he stepped from the
threshold into the fuller light of the candles
though the veil was not there the shadow
of the cowl lay dark across his features
drummond could read them no longer

  in the name of heaven whats been
going on paul demanded andrews
what have you done

 done echoed carlisle grimly
brought you a corpse and some patients
father youll have to bury cotameg and
look after the others well while im away
away echoed the priest in his turn
what do you mean

  he took a step after carlisle as the latter
unanswering passed out through the trad-
ing-room doorway

  are you leaving cumberland house
then paul he asked

yes carlisle told him im going
down river for the rest of my york boats
oh the ones from the pas came on
eh that was the cause of the fighting
yes they came three of them andrews
and-i sold them for a kiss

chapter ix

mutiny

t ewis his craggy face puckered in be-
 wilderment stared long at the canoe
gliding in to his post of the pas it was the
factors craft all right he could recog-


adventure

nize waseyawin and missowa bowsman
and steersman and the four middlemen as
well and there was carlisle himself amid-
ships with eugene drummond by his side
yet why were they here it was not in ac-
cordance with the outlined plans or the
issued orders something had happened
something had gone wrong lewis tugged
at his gray beard and muttered a wonder-
ing monologue till the factor was close
enough to hail him

  well lewis how is it with everything
here at the pas

  nae mon wull bother me ye ken fac-
tor replied lewis i ha done well wi
the trade an i maun no be complainin
an yersel wha aboot jihe york boats
had they ony trouble gettin up

  no but lots of trouble when they got
there richelieu has them now cargoes
and all and im bound down for the
others

  the deil an ye are sayin so factor
but wull ye no be stoppin a bit

  no-no time refused carlisle sheer-
ing off again i just wanted to let you
know keep a tight hand lewis ill see
you again on the way back

  on down the river the huge canoe
leaped flinging its miles behind winding
round its interminable curves to chimawa-
win lying where the saskatchewan broad-
ened into cedar lake but hampton had
no boats there

  us hasnt larned aught about them from
jarvis factor was his report to carlisle
not likely they comed across the lake yet
or its a very mistaken judgment i has

  so they were off again down cedar lake
through the narrows past the demie
charge rapids past the roche rouge
rapids to the grand rapids post here the
saskatchewan watering a vast empire in
its long journey from the rockies poured
at last into lake winnipeg and here jarvis
had the same report as hampton only
three york boats had crossed the lake the
three that had gone on to the pas

  jarvis couldnt tell the cause of the de-
lay they might be still on the river or
they might be moored at norway house
waiting for favorable weather to cross
jarvis did not know he would not know
till they arrived

  but strike me blind in the blinkers if
they aynt put heskimos or some other
god-forsyken copper-skins on for crews

he prophesied  cos wy should it tyke
them this long to reach ere cawnt come
fine and dry have to wait for the dirty
rain and blows we avent but three sea-
sons ere anywy factor-july haugust
and winter

  carlisle would have continued on across
the lake to norway house but the octo-
ber rains and gales were on and the winni-
peg was too dangerous at the moment for
canoe travel perforce he fretted away the
days at grand rapids ever watching for
the lift of the york boats through the
squalls the breath of winter blew fros-
tily down the vast inland sea

  all the forest was a dying blaze of color
cardinal-leaved moose maples yellow
birches canary willows umber cotton-
woods silvered poplars burning brightly
against the sere grasses of the gulches and
the purple-black spruce of the hills then
a weird storm with thunder lightning hail
sleet quenched the flame in a night and
the next morning the forests were stripped
to their swaying trunks and moaning
branches

  stark as a skeleton lay the land with
the sifting snow padding its bare ribs and
ragged vertebras like leprous flesh the
flowers were swept from the hills no
longer carlisle saw in the dance of blue-
bells joans laughing eyes no longer he
caught in the breeze-blown daisies the
golden shimmer of her hair he cursed
the laggard york boats and wore out his
eyes trying to pierce winnipegs wrack of
storm

  the lake raged incessantly a winter-
harrowed maelstrom its headlands hidden
by the breaking waves its islands frost-
armored over its beach littered with shore
ice broken off and cast high like chips its
three hundred miles of rollers ramping to
the clouds roaring at the migrant rout
scudding through the snow

  ae factor it is not wenipak now
described waseyawin who with missowa
always watched at his shoulder it is
keche the ocean wenipak

  so nodded missowa but in three
days the wind will lose its breath the air
will be sweet and warm

  indian summer eh missowa asked
carlisle

  thus the white men call it but it is not
of this earth it comes from afar from an-
other world it is the time when the spirits
ambush



of our forefathers rise to go forth on the
winter hunt and in that time of calm fac-
tor your boats will arrive

     missowas words proved true
in three days the wind seemed to
have blown out its lungs the earth
poised in a vacuum through which stole
mellow lights a haze of incense chatter of
birds droning of bees the gurgle of run-
ning rapids the snow steamed on the
slopes and the river ice pooled with black
water when all in one fleet manned by
york factory indians and steered by half-
breeds out of the dank lake vapor the
york boats rose like hoary ghost craft

  there had been a forest fire on the hayes
after the routing of the first boats up they
said and these later ones had been forced
to clear the stream of miles of half-burned
trees

  carlisle was ready for them when the
passing of the autumn season showed him
that there was no hope of getting the car-
goes up-river by boat he had made ready
his toboggans dog teams snow-shoes and
all his winter gear now the transfer from
boats to dog teams was arranged before
all was completed the weather changed
again

  some invisible hand loosed the leash that
held the wind opened the snowgates of
the sky the frosts bit like the stroke of
steel ahead lay a foot of river and lake
ice covered with sand-like drifts

  at chimawawin the factor drew on
hampton for a fresh relay of men dogs and
toboggans and sent the first relay back to
grand rapids to bring on the surplus stuff
he had been compelled to leave behind for
lack of outfits at the pas he repeated
sending back both relays and out of the
pas on the home trail he marshaled a long
train of toboggans each drawn by six hus-
kies and loaded with one thousand pounds
apiece

  with a surge of joy he turned his face up-
stream on the final relay- it was the com-
panys business but his heart was not in it
his heart was up yonder on sturgeon lake
where a mad girl would have finished by
this time the food he had surreptitiously
given her and no doubt be pining for more

  of a truth joan was pining for more
like medicine in her blood the provisions
carlisle had given her brought back the
roses to her cheeks but it was only for a

little and when the delicacies were done
she failed more rapidly than before worry
aided malnutrition

  the failure to capture the hudsons bay
companys york boats chagrined her and
her father beyond measure for waynes
attempt was no mere hostile raid it was
a serious venture forced by the dire need
of better sustenance and the fact that
richelieu had outwitted them as well as
carlisle was bitter as hemlock drink

  wayne brooded over it continually and
his brooding finally brought him to a reluc-
tant decision

  by the doom joan ill have to send
you out he told her his eyes dwelling
longingly upon her weve never been
separated before but i think the time has
come its too late now to get you out by
canoe but on the first snow ill send you
with mason by dog team to st paul

  no no father joan passionately pro-
tested i cant leave you here alone i
couldnt bear it alone at st paul ill fight
it out with you oh my dear i want to
i must i will there laughing her old
gay laugh as she cast herself into his arms
theres your defiant daughter sir but
dont worry ill be all right father let
us both be cheerful im sure something
unexpected will turn up

  she had no communication with cumber-
land house and knew nothing of the hud-
sons bay companys plans for since the
battle over the york boats the tension had
tightened about all three posts and rivalry
had grown more bitter the gates were
always closed now and a watch kept upon
the palisades

  antagonism flared openly the woods
were full of surprises by night daring
raiders dashed out trying to put torch to
their enemies stockades by day sharp
skirmishes occurred wood-gathering par-
ties were put to flight and hunters fired at
on lonely forest trails

  yet never in those eventful days had joan
seen or heard anything of carlisle she
wondered at his seclusion his silence per-
haps he had been unable to secure more
supplies for himself but in any event he
had intimated that he would not forget
her if she were in need and though she was
not just sure that her pride would let her
accept nevertheless she resented the ab-
sence of any overture

  the weeks passed without any sign from


adventure

him the geese went south the snow fell
and the frost crackled her indisposition
increased day by day to the observant
wayne her trouble seemed threefold-the
disturbing effect of the straight meat diet
the brooding over the free-trade prospects
and an apparent canker heart-longing for
which he could find no reason casting
about for a reason his mind turned upon
carlisle

  as a magnanimous enemy he had brought
her food to the palisades food which wayne
in a wrath was prone to throw away had
it not been for the girls actual need was
he more than a magnanimous enemy
wayne recalled the intimacy between him
and joan during the earlier part of the
canoe journey from grande portage also
the fact that together they had voyaged
the latter part of it without him

  foreboding entered into him perhaps
it was not worry not dangerous diet he had
to fear most perhaps something else was
eating her youthful health away the con-
suming desire of the void spaces of her
heart the emaciating hunger of her soul-
a hunger he himself had suffered all these
years

  you had better let me send over to
cumberland house for father andrews
he suggested hes skilled with medi-
cines and no doubt hell be able to give
you something to help you

  no father no you mustnt she
flashed with genuine fire we ask noth-
ing of the hudsons bay company and if
word passes between the posts it must come
first from cumberland house

        still her sickness persisted and
 jp wayne cursed the eternal nauseat-
ejlj ing gorge-raising meat it was af-
fecting even his iron self it was affecting
all his men he had disconcerting visions
of scurvy and plague and he told mason to
see that the men brewed spruce tea and
drank it as a preventive but the men had
long been muttering among themselves
brewing a draft of trouble

  they grumbled at their fare grumbled
at the spruce tea and when no one was
looking threw it in the snow they had
not bargained they told each other to live
through the winter eating each day three
meals of flesh and flesh alone all for the
sake of the indians trade

  they knew that if they went out fifty or

one hundred miles to the indians teepees in
their hunting districts and took back what
supplies they needed they would stir the
tribes to bloodshed and kill waynes trade
and prestige at one stroke but this they
violently threatened to do straight meat
was all right for eskimos and pagan in-
dians they stormed but they had been
born in the south

  had wayne not been so preoccupied
with his daughters condition he would
have marked the fermentation of discon-
tent the progression of discontent to open
mutiny but he spent most of his time with
joan who lapsing from her usual vigorous
activity lay listless and tired upon a couch
by the fireplace in his council-room
through the shortening winter days and
the ever-lengthening nights he would sit
smoking by her side staring at the pale face
upon the black bearskin couch-robes
racking his brains for a way out of the
situation pleading with her in vain to let
him get medicines or send her south

  mason warned him once that he feared
the men might get out of hand and he
promised to look into the matter but the
warning slipped from his mind in the treach-
erous fashion things had been slipping of
late he never remembered it till his bri-
gade leader stalked in on him and joan one
wintry dusk with the news that the men
had not come back that afternoon from
their fuel-gathering

  rudely shaken out of his thinking and
brooding wayne leaped up mentally alert
poised at his full height as if scented danger
had put him on his guard

  hows that mason he demanded
how long have they been away whend
they leave the post

  jist at noon wayne and im sartinly
gittin anxious

  but maybe theyre working late mason
maybe theyve had a brush with northwest-
ers or hudsons bay choppers and are lying
low to get in under cover of the dark

  the missourian shook his head his
weather-wrinkled alkali-seared face creas-
ing deeper in his anxiety

  mebbe so he doubted but thar aint
the ring of an ax or the spit of a rifle to be
heerd the woods is as still as a cussed
vault

  no noise eh pondered wayne
thats suspicious by the doom mason
if theyre trying to play me tricks ill have
ambush



the skins of the whole crowd how many
are left in the fort

  you me murdock and three more
well tell murdock and the three to
stand keen watch you and ill go out and
find them

  oh dont leave me here alone father
pleaded joan sliding off the couch and
glancing apprehensively at the winter dark
on the window-pane at the somber shad-
ows of the room take me with you i
dont know whats the matter with me but
im all nerves and i cant stay here alone
all right joan he humored her
its not very far put on something warm
and come with us

  over her blanket-cloth suit she slipped
her warmest capote beautifully cased in
ermine with the edge of the hood fringed
with tails of the silver fox she thrust her
moccasined toes into the loops of her tas-
seled snowshoes and passed out between
her father and mason over the soft snows
into the woods shuffling without a sound
they went wayne and mason on their
broad bears-paw shoes their rifles thrown
across their left arms in readiness

  around them crept the eeriness of the
winter night deep shadow in the under-
brush a half twilight in the open aisles the
snows refraction of the starlight filtering
through the festooned branches

  the forest was a fairyland filled with fan-
tastic shapes a strange cathedral packed
with voiceless worshipers standing white-
robed huddled upon their knees or lying
prone upon their hidden faces and over all
like the shroud of the dead spread the ever-
lasting snow cloaked on the tree boles
bossed on the stumps draped from the in-
terwoven branches plumed on the spruce
tops overhead

  from the roofed aisles they stepped out
into the slashed clearing where the free-
trading men had been at work there lay
the trampled chip-littered crust the felled
trees the sawn log lengths the chopped
stove wood all just as it had been left
the very axes were still sunk in the scored
blocks a few ghostly hares at play about
the piles vanished as the snowshoes began
to clatter on the chips wayne stooped
abruptly to examine something on the sur-
face of the padded area

  by the doom-look he commanded
harshly

  joan and mason stared speechless even

in the poor light they recognized the litter
wayne pointed out frozen bread crusts
rinds of bacon the chocolate blotch of tea-
leaves a forgotten rum jug lying empty on
the snow

  condemnation wayne blazed in ter-
rific wrath youre sure its our chopping
ground mason

  tarnation sure avowed mason
didnt i set them to work here and leave
them workin and they aint shifted
sence fer thems our axes

  the cursed curs theres only one
place they could get that stuff to eat
wayne was off as he spoke running round
the edge of the clearing searching for the
trail of the intruders

  here are their tracks he shouted
dozens of them coming from the direc-
tion of richelieus post the northwesters
wear longer-tailed snowshoes than ours
and there are the marks of both kinds going
back by heaven richelieu has drawn
them off come on mason come on
joan

  at a great speed he lurched out of the
woods again over the snows toward fort
wayne joan and mason running in the
path he broke

  murdock murdock he yelled to the
gatekeeper send out your three you
yourself stand in the entrance with rifle
ready my men have been eating and
drinking with the northwesters

dropping one armed man every
hundred yards or so to form a line
of communication with murdock
in the open gateway of his own fort wayne
led on to richelieus post mason he kept
by him and joan in spite of his entreaties
to stay back on this line of communica-
tion followed persistently upon their heels

  the gateway of the northwest post stood
open as they ran up and in the yellow glow
that flooded from the lighted windows out
across the trampled yard they could see
richelieu himself a heavy military coat
partially covering his resplendent uniform
standing in the entrance waiting as if he
had expected such a visit

  comment he chuckled when lie saw
their faces what do you want now
my men-curse you exploded wayne
his rifle threatening from the hip theyre
here i want them quick

  richelieu was unarmed but he showed


adventure

not the slightest fear of waynes nor ma-
sons weapons he reached out and plucked
wayne by the arm drawing him midway
into the entrance and pointing to a big door
in the mess building that faced the gate
the door had just opened wide to admit
two northwesters rolling in a keg of liquor
and it revealed a long candle-lighted table
inside loaded with food and lined with
feasting men

  ciel see them richelieu urged ma-
liciously hunger is a great chastener
ralph wayne they were tempted and
they fell there they are yours and mine
together i am not holding yours go and
take them

  with a growl wayne shook off the hand
on his arm and darted for the door

  mason stay at the gate with joan
he flung over his shoulder and put a bul-
let through that laughing devil if he so
much as moves

  joan did not obey as her father expected
she would instead she inserted her hand
within her capote felt in the pocket of her
blanket coat to assure herself that her pis-
tol was there and followed her father up to
the door of the mess building

  inside reigned bedlam pandemonium
drunken northwesters and free-traders all
mingled together gorging themselves at
the table laughing singing shouting smit-
ing each others backs at ribald stories and
hammering the board with their liquor
mugs as wild a revel as ever he glimpsed
wayne saw under the candle-light and the
sight sent him up the steps in a single jump

  in a whirl of passion he jammed between
the two northwesters who were rolling in
the liquor keg put sole upon the keg itself
on the top step and sprang into the mess
room with his rifle clubbed

  you condemned traitors you treach-
erous sneaks he denounced furiously his
gloomy face ablaze his mustaches quiver-
ing his rifle-butt swaying every second as
if to crash down upon the nearest head
you steal off into the woods and devour
like dogs what these dirty northwesters
throw you while my own daughter starves
for a bit of good food get up get up on
your drunken legs and out of this

  they were too far gone in liquor for
shame just a moment of bewildered star-
ing and a wave of laughter and jeering
drowned his rage they guffawed in his
face northwester and free-trader alike

  pounding the table more violently and
making the room shake with their incoher-
ent cries while from the head of the feast
one harris a mississippi river-man and
wood boss of the men that day rose up tee-
tering on his toes

  comen have a drink wayne he in-
vited  n ill sing ye a lit song lissen-
ere-

  by the doom you were responsible
harris wayne roared in interruption
and youre responsible still get the men
out call them out you every staggering
son of them or as sure as youre drunk your-
self youll never sing again

  waynes rifle-butt poised over harriss
head but without warning the two shrewd
northwesters in the doorway shot their
rolling keg into waynes legs from behind
wayne went down backward flat on the
floor his rifle flying from his hands the
two northwesters were upon him like cats
clutching and grappling preventing his
hands from securing the weapon again

  joan gave a cry as she saw her father go
down and groped in her coat for her pistol
mason had also seen from the gate and he
sprang forward his rifle outflung with
the lightning-like sighting of the woodsman
he took a snap shot in the doorway but he
had bargained without richelieu the lat-
ter reached the step as quick as mason
struck up the missourians rifle-barrel send-
ing the shot wild and wrestled for the pos-
session of the weapon

  joan had her own weapon out but both
her father and mason whirled in such a
tangle of bodies that she dared not shoot
for fear of injuring them she hovered on
the step of the mess-room doorway scream-
ing for aid through the frosty night

  murdock murdock she entreated
frenziedly my father-here bring all
the other men quick

  tearing forward abreast the four broke
through the gateway but richelieu had not
been there alone back in the shadows of
the stockade he had others lurking silently
waiting for such a rush as murdock and
his three companions surged through a
dozen northwesters leaped bodily upon
them bearing them down smothering their
spitting rifles in the snow

  tiens mademoiselle joan gloated
richelieu emerging from the fighting group
that overpowered mason you are the only
one left and you i will take myself
ambush



with the throb of the trapped
wild thing in her breast joan sprang
aside from his reach doubled back
upon him like an agile hare and raced for
the gateway firing as she ran the north-
westers still struggling to pinion murdock
and the other three free-traders there
was no one in the entrance to stop her but
richelieu was gaining on her at every stride

  she had on her snowshoes and he in
moccasins only outran her on the packed
snow of the yard the lurch of her run-
ning caused her to shoot wild while riche-
lieu dodged and laughed jeeringly strain-
ing every moment to catch her before she
left the palisades

  once twice three four-five times she
fired without effect then in the gateway
she whirled snapping the sixth and last
shot in richelieus face only arms length
away she saw his head flip back as if
jolted with a fist his body slumped feet
forward on the snow and slid in against the
open gate joan turned and ran with pal-
pitating heart across the deep snows out-
side

  she knew there was not a free-trader
left in fort wayne no safety for her in her
own post there was only one destination
in her mind-cumberland house there
was only one object of appeal-carlisle
with him there was at least sanctuary from
richelieu and his wild crew and mag-
nanimous enemy as he was he would surely
come to the aid of her father as he had done
once before

  like the wind she ran springing from
the heel on the resilient webbing of her
shoes twisting her feet in the swing of the
stride to clear her ankles of the fast-shift-
ing frames spurning the snow in white jets
behind her

  she looked back fearfully over her shoul-
der to see if richelieu had arisen again or
if any of his men were following but she
saw nothing heard nothing but the shout-
ing and laughter in the northwest post
the noise faded with the distance she
was alone on the cameo snows lighted
faintly by the stars and a wan aurora that
brightened the horizon to the northward

 cumberland house loomed ahead the
snow-roofed buildings crouching within the
drifted stockade rimmed by the black wall
of the forest and she pressed to the limit of
her speed as she swerved into the tram-
pled path before the gate another sound

  

  beside the shuffling of her snow-shoes
drifted to her ears

  she paused listening in the void of the
frost and immediately her wilderness-
trained ears interpreted the other sound a
blending of toboggan creak husky pant
snow-shoe crunch whip-crack-the weird
harmony of a coming dog-train on the trail

  wondering joan wheeled staring out
over the snow-blanketed ice and under the
play of the aurora she glimpsed it revealed
concealed and revealed again by the flash-
light flares the whole train imaged against
the pallid background like a painting of
the northland wastes

  she caught the impression in its entirety
the long winding furrow dotted with the
loaded toboggans each exactly alike except
that the more distant diminished in size
the track beaters ahead of the dogs leaning
forward on their smoking shoes the strain-
ing steaming six-dog teams the drivers on
the run their whips writhing through the
air the armed guards with rifles slung upon
their hunched shoulders

  and the figure in front of all tall big of
frame flattening the drifts with great
seven-foot snowshoes cut long and swift in
their lines for open-river work seemed to
her vaguely familiar

  there was something in his poise of body
in his stride in the way he held his head
looking straight forward under the hood of
his capote that insinuated itself into her
consciousness with a flash of enlighten-
ment illumination of brain or heart she
could not tell which she suddenly knew
him even under the furred capote she
knew him

  paul paul she cried and dashed down
the snowy bank toward him

chapter x

the red death

 you joan-now the god of north-
men is good exulted carlisle catch-
ing her hands and bringing her to a stop
upon her coasting snow-shoes i was
never dreaming-

  but his gauntleted palm had closed upon
the hard steel weapon in her grip and his
tone changed

 good heavens girl whats this
whats wrong

oh come quickly paul you and your


adventure

force she implored my fathers a pris-
oner in richelieus post with all his men

  involuntarily his mind flew back to the
night when with this very weapon and
with other weapons more mighty she had
delayed him from reaching his york boats
in time to prevent them being captured

  yet he knew this was no ruse of hers
there was no doubting the sincerity of her
words as she poured out the story of riche-
lieus cunning and how with his hands al-
most upon her he had fallen to her last shot
in the gateway of his stockade

  curse him carlisle anathematized
i hope its through his dirty heart let me
help you up the bank joan there my
men will be up in a minute

  from the top of the bank he began to call
out the news to them to eugene drum-
mond missowa waseyawin and their four
middlemen who with the coming of winter
at grand rapids had put aside canoe and
paddle for toboggan and racket they
together with the drivers from the lower
river posts cracked their whips more lust-
ily urging on the dogs

  marche marchel they called httl
hul

  with the spume flying from the toboggan
hoods they made a rush at the incline
teams clawing tenaciously track-beaters
hauling from the front with tow ropes
drivers shoving from behind toboggan
after loaded toboggan undulated over the
crest amid a mist-like shower of snow

  chawl chawl yelled the drivers and
the giddes swerved to the right into the
beaten track that wound up to the gates of
cumberland house

  who comes there demanded the loud
voice of galt

  carlisle was the answer hurry up
galt theres trouble over at richelieus
post and were needed there

  immediately the gate swung open and
the dog-drivers cracked their whips anew

  yeel yee they commanded

  the teams hauled round to the left with
the sweep of the trail and galloped tri-
umphantly into the yard where they were
swallowed up by a rush of shouting men

  wheres andrews galt asked carlisle
bellowing to make himself heard in the
clamor

  here paul answered andrews himself
pushing through the crowd garbed in his
winter gear the heavy capote with the fur-

fringed helmet-like hood drawn as close
about his face as he was wont to draw the
dun cowl and mosquito veil in summer
im glad youre safely back also glad to
see youve got supplies

  forest fires delayed the york boats
father so that the frost caught us

  whos that with you ah-you miss
wayne

  yes and its only by grace of a lucky
bullet that she is here carlisle told him
richelieu you understand her father
and his men are prisoners she says and she
did well to escape

  you brave girl eulogized andrews
taking her hands but you didnt-kill
him he added anxiously

  i-i dont know confessed joan i
fired in his face and he went down thats
all i know

  a job for you in any case father
intimated the factor and who knows but
you may have many more galt giving
orders to the chief trader have the drivers
of the lower river posts keep guard here
arm all our cumberland house force and
bring them on our heels

he turned through the entrance
again with joan and andrews and
eugene drummond waseyawin
missowa and their middlemen sped after
trailed by the rest of the hudsons bay men
as fast as galt could hand out the weapons

  as they skimmed back on joans tracks
toward the northwest post they saw that
the gate was still open and at the entrance
the girl hesitated with repugnance till
carlisle took her hand with a reassuring
gesture

  there was blood upon the snow but no
sign of richelieu himself ahead of them
across the space of the yard bulked the
log mess building the door was closed
but a yellow glow sprayed from the lighted
square of the windows on either side of
the door-jambs

  listening they could hear no singing or
shouting but the angry hum of voices
buzzed from within as from a colossal hive
of bees

  wed better leave our snow-shoes here
suggested carlisle and dont make a
sound in the yard

  he set the example by twisting his toes
from their loops and sticking the tails of
his shoes into the snow the others did the
ambush



same creeping after him panther-footed
in their moccasins through the hard-packed
yard they reached the level of the steps
without noise and craning their necks
peered through the lighted window on the
nearer side of the door

  inside the rough-walled mess-room the
feast was all disordered the feasters all
disarranged although it was at once ap-
parent that no hands had been laid upon
the main body of the free-traders who had
partly composed the feast

  too drunk to care what company ruled
the northland they slouched in their chairs
or lolled forward across the table grinning
maudlinly at the plight of wayne who had
sought to chastise them upon half a
dozen chairs wayne mason murdock and
the other three sober men sat in a row
against the wall their limbs bound tightly
to the chair backs and the chair legs

  across one cleared end of the table lay
richelieu his uniform flashing bright under
the candlelight as three or four northwest-
ers worked over him and in the ministering
hands those outside could see his muscles
stir slightly

  hes not dead anyway thank heaven
whispered andrews

  then the devil must have him in special
keeping growled carlisle under his breath
as he laid his hand quietly on the latch
stand well to one side of the door jamb
joan and you andrews in case of shoot-
ing

 he swung the door wide and stepped
swiftly upon the doorsill two long pistols
in his hands covering the packed room

  bon soir messieurs he greeted them
mockingly

  he gave neither order nor threat yet in-
stinctively they knew his intent and froze
into immobility staring at his huge figure
in the frost-rimmed furred capote and at
the other figures likewise frost-rimed
who crowded behind him on the steps their
long-barreled rifles looking down the table

  so richelieu met with a little accident
in his game carlisle laughed is he
badly hurt

  not badly we think msieu returned
one of the northwesters somewhat sullenly
but you have a doctoring priest there he
could tell

  surely acquiesced carlisle will you
take a look at him father

  he made room for andrews to push in

and the priest walked up to the table where
richelieu lay

  through the muscles of his neck pere
the frenchman pointed out the course of
the ball he is just on the edge of-how
do you say it-coming to

  yes nodded andrews passing a lighted
candle over richelieu as he lay and no
great danger in that ball through his neck
muscles but do you see what is all through
his face

  frost scars hazarded the northwester
staring

  frost scars no you never saw frost
scars like those the man has smallpox

  swifter and harder than lead the diag-
nosis hit them every one in the room
seemed to start as if from a violent shock
the northwesters around richelieu threw
up their arms before their faces in tangible
defense against the plague while all the
rest crossed themselves in palpable terror

  even the slouching free-traders were
stirred the horrible significance of the
word penetrated their drunken conscious-
nesses they stood up unsteadily their
faces whitening sucking in their breaths
in nervous clicks

  yet only for an instant did the great
crowd cower abruptly in a frantic rush
in an insane stampede they dashed for the
doorway

  carlisles big frame blocked the exit and
he met the rush with clubbed pistols like
cattle they came shoving trampling
frenzied with fear three of them went
down from his clubbed weapons a dozen
more were hurled back from the stiff rifle
barrels around him as from the ends of
lances

  the rout fell aside temporarily checked
swerved and made for the windows swing-
ing chairs they smashed away the glass and
frames but at carlisles command several
of his men had sprung to the outside of the
windows and an array of rifle-barrels
speared the northwesters back into the
room

  stop roared carlisle through the crash-
ing babel stop your panic or ill order
my men to shoot they can rake the whole
place from the door and windows which
will you face smallpox or bullets

  the threat stayed for a little their wild
frenzy and carlisle seized upon the mo-
ment of their uncertainty to try to prevent
another stampede


adventure

  theres no use in making confounded
fools of yourselves he told them you
have to face the situation anyway so why
not face it like men im not going to let
you get away to any other post or indian
camp to spread the infection there just
make up your minds to fight a sane light
here first some free-trader cut loose
wayne and the rest

harris the mississippi river man
who had wanted to sing wayne a
song stepped forth the crisis
had sobered him like a dash of cold water
and he quickly slit the chair lashings with
his sheath knife freeing the six men

  now wayne you and your iree-trad-
ers are under quarantine with the north-
westers carlisle informed him i hope
youre not thinking of making any trouble
about it if you are make it right now and
well have it over with

  do you take me for a cursed fool
blazed wayne i know smallpox i had
it myself once on the red river my men
have been hobnobbing with these north-
westers and two of the bloody dogs mauled
me all over why i wouldnt dream of
going back to my post i wouldnt go near
my worst enemy i wouldnt rub up
against you carlisle and i hate you worse
than a hundred hells

  thanks carlisle sent back sarcasti-
cally wayne youre no hypocrite any-
way

  but for heavens sake watch my girl
wayne implored in his next breath keep
her away from this place joan stand
back from the doorway there

  im all right father joan assured him
ive never been in the room

  did richelieu touch you girl

  no father no he didnt and how i
wish youd never gone in after your men
so do i though im not afraid for my-
self growled her father but it cant be
helped now anyhow not likely anything
will come of it whats the program
carlisle

  everybody parade for inspection car-
lisle answered  youll all pass before
andrews any further cases remain here
in the mess-room with richelieu the rest
go over to the trading-room till we see what
develops richelieus house well save for
the recoveries file up every one

  some bold some fearful nearly all ner-

vous they passed in review before the priest
who examined each one closely for symp-
toms with his lighted candle now and
then he put a question bearing on their
general health or diet

  twice he motioned a northwester out
of the line to sit down in a chair by the
table there was scarcely need to examine
the free-traders since they had been ex-
posed to infection only that day but for
the impression of equality in the unfortu-
nate circumstance andrews scanned them
over with the rest

  only the two cases besides richelieu
he announced when he had finished his in-
spection

  all right the two cases can clear this
room and knock together three bunks while
the rest go to the trading-room as i said
directed carlisle

  but bon dieu burst out the north-
wester dentaire he of the pointed mus-
tache and the large hawked nose do you
mean to pack us there like curs waiting for
the red death to come and choose which
one

  where else can i put you countered
carlisle out in the freezing woods

  i-i will not go dentaire shrieked
his pale face contracting in convulsive
muscular twitchings his eyes staring wide
horrific his trembling fingers never ceasing
their continual crossing non nonl nor
mes camarades either

  come out first you ordered carlisle
sensing a new outbreak and leveling his
weapons at dentaire

  dentaire dived suddenly behind the
crowd and with a sweep of his feet kicked
out the legs of the big sheet-iron stove in
the middle of the room with a crash the
mass of red-hot metal fell upon the floor
and its bushels of glowing coals poured out
across the planks dry as dead moss the
slivery planks blazed up instantaneously
and not content with fire in one place
dentaire scattered the coals to all corners
of the room

  you hold us here to do your will he
gibbered behind the screen of his fellows
you will not let us out of the room voila
then there will be no room the candles
mes camarades-the candles aussil

  they seized them from the table and flung
them lighted into anything inflammable
into the woodbox into the cupboard into
piles of old papers on the shelves about the
ambush



walls the place was aflame in all quarters
at once choked with smoke and shaken to
its foundations by the concerted rush to
escape

  dentaire slim swift as a dancing-master
was in the van of those who surged to the
doorway half-minded at first to put a ball
through him carlisle lowered his weapons
and made way the room was now a roar-
ing furnace and there was no holding men
in it to be burned to death

  back from the door and windows he
ordered galt shut the gate and you
joan keep close to me back men i say
and for the lives of you dont touch any of
them

  oui touch us at your peril warned
dentaire stop us at your doom but
put the hand on us and receive the red
death

  in a stream they gushed forth leaping
down the steps vaulting over the window-
sills northwesters and free-traders to-
gether in wild flight in strange anomaly
armed men backing away from men only
partly armed the hudsons bay force gave
them the right of way weapons could
hold domination over them penned within
walls but not as a mad horde here in the
open where a hand grip might prove more
deadly than a bullet

  shoot dentaire shrieked crazily
shoot if you have the thought to keep us
you may kill one two six a dozen but
i swear by the virgin that the rest will lay
the plague on you with their fingers come
on mes camarades come on

  the demented fool denounced carlisle
helplessly the whole mob of demented
fools hold your fire men the idiot
means what he says

  the rush passed them some making for
the gate some for the shed next the store
where the snow-shoes and toboggans were
kept galt had managed to wedge the
gate bar so that it could not be withdrawn
but the crazed mob was not to be denied
mary climbed up on the palisades to the
top of the gate many more groveled in
the snow at the bottom worming their
shoulders under the heavy barrier with
a united heave they tore the gate bodily
from its hinges and hurled it aside

  meanwhile their comrades had cast down
the toboggans thrown on the grub-bags
from the store seized their snow-shoes and
rushed to join them together the two

sections surged through the gateway north-
westers and free-traders still mingled all
richelieus frenchmen and post indians
all waynes men of the missouri men of the
mississippi men of the red his crees and
chippewayans-the whole crowd that had
been drinking with the northwesters that
day

  their panic seemed to increase as they
ran they strained forward bound for
immunity wherever they might find it
falling over each other upon the aurora
lighted snows till they disappeared into
the black mystery of the surrounding
forest

except the hudsons bay forces
none remained in the yard but
richelieu whom andrews and
wayne had carried out and laid down within
the light and heat of the fire wayne him-
self mason murdock and the three sober
free-traders having contracted the dis-
ease one summer while doctoring indian
camps on eabamet lake andrews like
wayne had no fear of contamination him-
self yet he was careful to keep his patient
apart from the others

  although richelieu stirred from time to
time he had never opened his lips or his
eyes upon his forehead close up to the
hair the priest could discern a large bruise
where he had evidently struck his head
against the gate in falling

  the head blow is the cause of his un-
consciousness rather than the neck wound
andrews pointed out to carlisle and the
others who came peering from a respectful
distance where shall we take him paul
is there any chance of saving the other
buildings

  not the slightest chance carlisle de-
cided well do well if we keep the fire in-
side the palisades we dont want it to
get into that fringe of trees and round
through the forest to the other posts
richelieu must stay wliere he is for a little
hell not be cold in this heat

  you wont risk trying to get anything
out paul-the supplies or the furs asked
joan anxiously

  carlisle shook his head grimly

  no the risks too great theyve been
handling the food and pelts you see we
darent touch anything but i think well
level the store and fur house to hold the
flames as low as possible


adventure

  he ran outside the palisades with galt
drummond and others and came back
bearing long trunks of young spruce that
had been drawn up from the woods for fuel
these were five or six inches through and
stripped of their branches of a fit size to
be handled as battering rams

  the mess building was all a-roar throb-
bing on the night like the fire-pit of some
gigantic engine belching flame through
windows and door and the roof that was
commencing to sag

 the heat was terrific lance-like unbear-
able upon the uncovered flesh but with the
hoods of their capotes puckered tight to
shield their faces from the flames carlisle
and his men crept up to the buildings with
the long spruce trunks in their gauntleted
hands

  with swing and prod swing and prod
they battered off the already burning roof
troughs of the fur room exposing the top
logs which they began to rattle down tier
by tier but the fire was quicker than they

  it caught on the walls and beams and
the pelts that hung thereon and the flare
of the greasy fats shot fifty feet in the air

  what a waste deplored joan as
carlisle and the men were forced to fall
back from the geyser of flame what a
waste of splendid fur

  yes but it couldnt be otherwise ob-
served carlisle we couldnt have saved
it even if we had wanted to the heats
enough to shrivel one

  still it was with a qualm of regret that he
gazed over his shoulder as he rushed in
again toward the store mink marten
otter ermine costly beautiful blazed and
wrinkled before his eyes rare silver and
black-fox skins singed and smouldered the
silky fur curling up like downy feathers to
the licking flame he saw it as desecration
as profanation as a crime against the en-
during wild-and all the handiwork of the
panic-stricken dentaire

  the roof of the store he got off before the
fire reached it the wall logs thundered
down amid clanking showers of cooking
utensils knives axes and other trade-stuff
from the shelves his own trade-stuff that
richelieu had captured in his york boats
piled upon the floor standing revealed un-
der the fires glare showed his own food
supplies captured at the same time along
with the trade-stuff

  there were greases in the supplies

galt he told his chief-trader pork and
such and some kegs of powder that might
be dangerous pass the kegs along as i
shove them out

  one by one with his pole butt he rolled
the barrels and kegs off the floor and they
were prodded far back into the snow beyond
the fire zone then he pushed down the
top tier of the flour bags stacked in layers
of four three of the sacks fell with solid
dusty thuds the fourth struck lightly
and bounced to the feet of galt

  whats that henry asked carlisle
not heavy enough for flour is it

  the chief-trader stooped and scrutinized
it by the brilliant light discerning a canvas
dunnage bag with drawstrings in its mouth
it bore the customary marking h b c
and as galt turned it over with his pole
the name cotameg stared him in the face

 by nenaubosho the cree evil
spirit he exclaimed its the chippe-
was gear-bag factor piled in by mistake
among the flour sacks when they captured
your boats

  by jove galt is that so cried carlisle
coming over to look unlucky cotameg
you buried him without his gear eh

  we had to declared galt we
couldnt find liis gear and i guess it was
here aluthe time

  with a thud of his pole he broke the
drawstrings in the mouth of the bag
thrust the end of the pole into the open
mouth and shook it out rolled worn moc-
casins soiled trousers of buckskin frowsy
parfleches of a filthiness unimaginable

  shades of bold rupert blurted car-
lisle i didnt know he was as dirty as all
that is that the only gear he owned
but galts eyes were brighter than car-
lisle had ever seen eyes of cree shading
his face was more violently astounded than
carlisle had ever beheld a face of cree casting

  its-its not cotamegs he stammered
even his voice losing the unemotional timbre
of his mothers tongue its old white
loons and his familys-the smallpox
indians i stopped from coming in to cum-
berland house

  by heavens galt are you sure
bellowed carlisle

  sure didnt i stand and see them strip
it off at my orders there are five moc-
casins all of different sizes white loon
had two sons a nephew and a cousin with
him you remember
ambush



  besides i went out to drop a few trees on
their camp and burn it at the first snow
when there was no danger of firing the forest
but the clothes were gone i put the theft
down to the sneaky wolverines set fire to
the teepee and thought no more about it
but galt cotameg didnt take and
put them in his gear-bag you under-
stand indians and you know no indian
born would go near the smallpox camp at
carcajou cove much less lay a hand on
anything there

  i know nodded galt pushing bag and
all back into the fire it was no indian
who put them in cotamegs bag it was
a white man a white man with the iron
nerve of the devil

  then who was that white man pro-
pounded carlisle

to the chief-trader he put the ques-
tion to eugene drummond and
all the hudsons bay forces behind
to joan hovering as near as the flames
would let her to wayne and his five faith-
fuls grouped by themselves off to one side

  they stared at him unanswering stricken
dumb by the horrible enormity of the thing
and as he looked into their eyes recollec-
tions of many past incidents flashed un-
bidden through carlisles mind

  he remembered that it was cotameg who
had let the northwest mail-courier bertand
escape into grande portage remembered
cotamegs frequent absences from cumber-
land house his delay in coming in to the
post from his fishing upon the morning he
wanted to send him to the pas and the fact
that richelieu know he had sent for his
york boats and was on the watch for their
coming

  i see it now he burst out suddenly
cotameg was in richelieus pay from the
first the chippewa must have been at
the northwest post that sunday morning
i sent him and smoking pine down-river
and thats when his gear-bag was filled un-
known to him it was a plan to turn the
plague loose in cumberland house but in
the ways of the north the bag came back
untouched to the one who filled it

  my god paul cried joan shuddering
how could any man do that

  he aint wan man put in drummond
promptly he be wan fiamin diable an
if i be had ma way im would trow heem
back into de fire were he be come from

  thats the way to talk drummond
supported wayne its only what he
deserves

  maybe theres worse than fire in store
for him reminded andrews prophetically
hes fully conscious now paul his eyes
are open

  richelieu awoke in a daze raising him-
self up on his elbow and staring at the blaz-
ing walls which had burned low enough to
allow the hudsons bay men to dart in and
scoop snow upon the flames with their long
snow-shoes used as shovels

  name of a name he blurted unable to
comprehend the crimson glare the shoveling
figures of the men and the hiss of the snow
masses smothering the fire i dreamed
i was on the brink of hell comment
has my dream come true

  partly explained carlisle grimly strid-
ing over to him your men set fire to your
post and scattered to the thirty-two points
of the north when they heard you had
smallpox

  smallpox echoed richelieu unbeliev-
ingly

  yes the red death cotamegs dun-
nage-bag came back to you among the food-
sacks

  richelieus lips parted stiffly but carlisle
poised his moccasined foot as if to spurn
him into the dying conflagration

  dont say a word richelieu he warned
passionately not a cursed word or in
you go

  richelieu closed his lips again and car-
lisle dropped his foot

  i guess well get a toboggan and run
him across to cumberland house he told
andrews eugene run and fetch it ill
set aside one of my buildings for him alone

  condemnation no you wont carlisle
expostulated wayne ive no love for you
as i said but im a white man none of
your hudsons bay traders have been ex-
posed to infection we six free-traders
have besides ive had it andrews has
had it so well take andrews and richelieu
to fort wayne with us richelieu can be
put in the fur house well use the trading-
room and andrews may have my own
quarters

  by jove you are a white man wayne
accepted carlisle his face lighting up
i wouldnt have asked it of you but i
take your offer in the spirit in which its
given


adventure

  theres a little selfishness in it wayne
confessed i would go crazy if joan were
near any infection and youll have to give
her quarters at cumberland house send
your men over now to my post for her stuff
and the furs and everything but the bare
necessities well use they can gut the
buildings before we go into them and
about the furs youll keep them in trust
only so that there will be no trouble over
them

  all right agreed carlisle heartily
hastening to issue his orders and to direct
drummond to place the toboggan he had
brought so that richelieu might roll onto
it and wayne ill leave you a load of
provisions at your palisade gate

  thanks nodded wayne ill take
them in the spirit theyre given

  he passed with his five free-traders
through the gateway andrews drum-
mond galt and the other hudsons bay
men followed after drawing richelieu upon
the toboggan carlisle turned from a last
inspection of the smoking post ruins and
gave joan his hand for the run across the
snows to cumberland house

  we too are in isolation he observed
with a whimsical laugh do you happen
to care joan

  she gave him a tantalizing smile as they
raced side by side

  as long as i can go to my fathers
stockade every day talk to him and know
that he is all right i-why i expect to be
very comfortable in cumberland house
she evaded naively and do you know
what im going to make you do the very
minute we get there paul

  what he challenged

  cook me a full course-dinner joan
decreed

chapter xi

oochemegou kesigow

the full tale of the flight of the sturgeon
lake northwesters and free-traders
did not come down the saskatchewan to
carlisle for several weeks christmas day
passed without the arrival of any of his
indian trappers but about three oclock on
new years day the jingle of bells brought
him and joan running to the door

  a grand cree cavalcade they beheld to-
boggans and carioles drawn by gaily capa-

risoned dogs with bead-worked blankets on
their backs and bells upon their collars pot-
tering in the rear the squaws drove the
teams with the duffle children and furs
packed into the carioles but the hunters
sped in front gorgeous in their new capotes
and leggings fringed with porcupine quills

  at carlisles beckoning they trooped up
to the steps where he stood led by old
soaring eagle a chief of the tribes and one
of the best fur-takers on his books

  it is oochemegou kesigow-the new
years-the kissing day of the crees when
every man is supposed to kiss every woman
in sight- factor soaring eagle greeted
and we are here according to our custom
that is good soaring eagle returned
carlisle gravely albeit there was a twinkle
in his eye as his glance met joans there
is a gift for each one of you at the store when
you trade your furs how was the catch
we took much fur factor reported
soaring eagle but we will take no more
in that upper country after the trade and
feast we will hunt toward the wenipak
the red death is raging yonder and we
fear it stalking through our teepees

  where soaring eagle demanded joan
anxiously where is it raging

  where roams the wind golden daugh-
ter where fall the forest leaves the
red death is killing out the posts and tribes
of the french company and the free-
trading men as red fire runs among the
trees so my far-journeying tribesmen
bring the word

  it hasnt got among our own indians
then or into our own posts asked carlisle
with concern

  no declared soaring eagle for the
struggle among the companies has been
bitter and nothing but rifle balls has passed
between but the tribes of the hudsons
bay company in the other districts are
fearful even as we they are fleeing from
the red death going east toward james
bay south upon the prairie or north to the
barren lands

  heavens ejaculated carlisle that
means the closing of those posts are there
no districts free from it at all

  the tales of the indian runners say that
it has not spread as far as fort des prairies
yet nor to the athabasca but that all posts
are closed against newcomers

  carlisle pointed toward richelieus dis-
mantled post
ambush



  theres where the red death started
soaring eagle he informed

  so ran the story of those who fled among
the indians and posts of the other districts
nodded the old chief

  and there went on carlisle point-
ing to fort wayne the northwest leader
is sick with it there the free-trade leader
watches by the bed of mason the only one
left alive of five faithful men there our
praying man is with them all under the
plague

  so nodded soaring eagle unmoved
  you are not afraid

  i am not afraid factor if it was not
good for us to come you would have sent
a runner to warn us we are here and after
the feast we trail to the wenipak

  it is well concluded carlisle go to
the store now and galt will give you your
gifts

  it is oochemegou kesigow reminded
soaring eagle looking at joan

  carlisles eyes twinkled again but joan
was equal to the occasion

  i kiss you all she spoke tacitly in cree
touching her finger-tips to her lips and toss-
ing them the caress

  soaring eagle and the others gravely
acknowledged the salute catching the kiss
in mid-air on their own finger-tips and carry-
it to their mouths then they stalked off to
the store

carlisle backed hastily indoors
under joans indignant assault

you wanted him to say it she
accused just wait till you have to salute
all the greasy squaws but seriously paul
isnt it horrible news

  its very bad admitted carlisle with
a shake of his head yet dont let it spoil
our new years dinner joan i wouldnt
care about myself but i want lewis and the
men of the other posts to enjoy themselves
you see its the only break for them in the
whole winter

  i wont let the news spoil it she prom-
ised though theres fear in my heart
fear of what

  fear that it means the end of my fathers
already shaken power

  i dont know carlisle deftly hedged
i cant tell anything about it till i get word
how things stand in the other districts from
official quarters the governor promised
when i left james bay to have a message

routed through before spring to let me know
the exact situation but hurry joan it
will soon be dark and the men will be over
from the store

  joan hastened about directing the work
of the two young cree maids in the kitchen
putting the finishing touches upon her new
years dinner spread upon the long table in
the factors council-room and while he
watched her gliding about carlisle mar-
veled at the miracle of a womans touch
in softening the bare austerity of his former
quarters

  he had given the house up to her entirely
since the night richelieus post was wrecked
and the rest went to fort wayne to do with
it what she willed

  he himself had taken business and sleep-
ing quarters in galts trading-room with
galt and drummond and it was ever a
source of pleasure to them to pass from that
rough environment into this newly conse-
crated feminine sphere for their meals or to
spend the long storm-bitten winter evenings
before the roaring birch logs of the fireplace

  the possessions transferred from fort
wayne before it went under quarantine
she had used to garnish cumberland house
formerly carlisles council-room contained
nothing but table and chairs guiltless of
any adornment now the bate planks of
the floor were hidden under a plethora of
fur rugs skins of the wolf lynx black and
grizzly bears the bare walls were covered
with curios weapons of the savage tribes
antlers of the red deer moose and caribou
horns of mountain-sheep and musk-ox

  her cushions filled with downy wild-
goose feathers covered with leather in
colored patterns and trimmed with indian
bead-work padded the chairs her couch
luxuriously fur-robed invited lounging by
the fireplace her pictures decorated the
mantel above

  in one corner stood her harpsichord
brought in by the red river route from st
paul while upon a shelved cabinet beside
was piled her music and her library a col-
lection begun while schooling at st paul and
added to at every opportunity-history
travel poetry french and spanish novels
which she read in the original

  upon the table she hovered over in the
deepening dusk of the room was arrayed
her cherished linen flat silverware china
the magnificent silver tea-service and tall
brass candelabra


adventure

  the latter she filled with candles and as
she lighted them the hudsons bay officers
came tramping over from the store drum-
mond galt lewis in from the pas lea
from the nepowin garry from moose lake
hampton from chimawawin jarvis from
grand rapids wells from the seepanock
channel

  bon soir mademoiselle wayne greet-
ed drummond opening the door in the
lead his volatile face a-quiver with sup-
pressed merriment wan happy new
year to you an im wondaire if you re-
membaire dis day be oochemegou kesi-
gow

   soaring eagle told you eugene 
flashed joan intuitively breaking into
laughter with them all but it shall never
be said that i did less for white men than
for red you may kiss my hand sir

  with the air of an old-world courtier
drummond bent over it then all his com-
panions and joan with a queenly gesture
waved them to the table

  the feast is ready be seated gentle-
men she directed

  she took her stately place behind the
silver tea-service carlisle took his opposite
her beyond the branching candelabra at
the foot of the table and the other officers
ranged themselves on either side under
the mellow candlelight they dined like true
lords of the north in the presence of a
gracious lady

  course by course the quiet-footed cree
maids served the meal-soup of delicious
moose meat stewed ptarmigan breasts
garnished with forest herbs fish course of
flaky lake trout the savory dressed goose
the christmas pudding and cake and the
wines of sicily and madeira

illllll then while the men lighted the
llllll fragrant company tobacco in their
pipes joan stole away to her instru-
ment playing soft dreamy airs that wafted
like summer winds through the hazy in-
cense of the room as they smoked and
listened the officers gave their brief verbal
reports to carlisle so much fur taken in
trade this and that incident in the post
routine such and such friction with the ad-
herents of the rival companies

  succinctly garry told how a vagrant party
of free-traders sacked two of his fur trains
on moose lake lea described the looting
of his nepowin post by a tribe of the french

companys indians and his struggle to save
the greater part of the fur which he had
managed to cache safely on the saskatche-
wan by the mouth of ptarmigan creek

  wells related how he had captured a
northwest guide forerouteing the see-
panock channel for brigades in the spring
and sent him southward on la longue
traverse to the assiniboine

  but never fear zur wells concluded
in his broad wheeze they zhant get
through there i will zee tot

  their tones were low so as not to raise
discord in the musics harmony joans
playing was zephyr-like unobtrusive as
meditation so as not to break the thread of
their council but as the talk lagged and
lapsed her music increased in volume and
the men heard the airs of their own lands
swelling in their ears

  with magic interpretation she played
them back to those lands to the rugged
highlands the english downs the vineyards
of sunny france their battle chants their
hymns of unction their folk legends their
hearth songs the songs that never die she
played them and their hearts went out
to their far-off homes

  galt drove an imaginary paddle down to
the sault home of the white adventurer
who had fathered him and his old mother
of the crees drummond lay sun-basking
under the loom of the pyrenees on the banks
of the river adour garry and lea trod
again their beloved inverness and cro-
marty hampton climbed his devon hills
jarvis saw and heard the color and rattle of
london wells stood under the waving
trees upon the green lawns of the squires
house lewis watched with his aged eyes
the gray seas breaking upon the foamy crags
which whelped him in his nostrils the salted
fog in his soul the void that runs

from the dim shielding of the misty island
mountains divide us and a world of seas

but still ours hearts are true our hearts are highland
   and we in dreams behold the hebrides

  on and on she played while they drifted
in their dreams and carlisle lay back in his
chair before the fireplace watching her
through the blue wreaths of his pipe smoke
ethereal intangible she seemed through the
blur the candlelight filtering softly on her
spun-gold hair and golden satin dress and
striking the facets of a few choice rings
upon her nimble fingers
ambush



  for him too her magic was potent he
was a little boy again in the post of niagara
his was the boyish vision of its pageants
and alarms and his was the boyish memory
of his father tall straight handsome in the
dashing uniform of a captain of the rangers
-all in that old day before his mother died

  when the music ceased they did not know
it till they saw joan slipping off the stool and
coming toward them through the haze

  isnt it time to starttheir dance paul
she smiled you know i want to take my
father his own new years dinner very
soon

  yes yes assented carlisle returning
from his childhoods vision and dropping
his pipe ashes into the birch logs well go
right over and set things going and then
see about the dinner

  he helped her on with the beautiful
ermine capote its hood fringed with tails
of the silver fox and they followed the men
across to the store buildings and into the
trading-room

  the trading-room was full of whites
breeds and indians of both sexes waiting
expectantly they like carlisles officers
had feasted to the full and now they were
ready for the merriment

  the room was cleared for the occasion
benches ranged round the sides and the
walls and ceiling lined with bright red calico
and hung with the new years decorations
of evergreens and scarlet swamp berries
upon galts counter were placed three
chairs for the musicians high up under the
burning candles upon the shelves

  one of these chairs galt took himself with
his violin drummond and jarvis climbed
up on either side of him with bass viol and
piccolo the crowd upon the floor at
carlisles direction resolved itself into coup-
les forming a circassian circle round the
room and to the vamping of the violin
strings the dance was on

  buoyantly madly they danced all their
spirits congealed through long lonely
months melting instantly in the warmth of
human companionship and effervescing
in flourish laughter and shout though
carlisle and joan withdrew after the first
dance the gaiety did not pause they had
given it the necessary impetus the feet of
joyous abandon were loosed

  while they watched a little the square
dances string dances and round dances
shuttled in quick succession the musi-

cians changed the instruments changed
violin viol and piccolo giving way to man-
dolin tambourine or bagpipes but the tide
of music and restless muscles flowed per-
petually

  one moment it was galt leading the
feather dance of the tribes the next drum-
mond banging the tambourine he had learn-
ed from iris spanish neighbors and reeling
a spanish whirl or again lewis strutting
the length of the room his droning bag
under his arm skirling away on the pipes
to the highland steps

from that carnival of color and
movement carlisle and joan were
never missed when they stole unos-
tentatiously back to the factors house
the cree maids had cleared the table but
according to joans instructions they had
reserved a choice portion of each course
enough for wayne and andrews and mason
if he should have the heart to taste the soup
or nibble a ptarmigan breast

  it was packed in a large lidded basket
woven of willow by the cree weavers all
ready to be warmed up and eaten and
carlisle adding a bottle of wine and a
canister of tobacco hung the basket over
his shoulder by its leather thong

  the sound of the dance echoed forth from
the trading-room as they passed by and on
along the fringe of trees toward the camp-
fires of the crees here in the shelter of the
forest all those in from the trap-lines had
made open bivouac snow-walled quadran-
gles scraped to earth floored with spruce
boughs and warmed by abundant fires

  a few old squaws too old to care for the
revelry in the post were tending the fires
whileround the blaze sprawled many groups
of wolf-dogs stick-tied to prevent them
wandering or fighting lying with feet out-
stretched to the heat or worming forward
luxuriously upon their bellies

  each team relaxed by themselves snarl-
ing defiance at any inquisitive encroacher
from a strange outfit and baring fangs in
meteor-like leap and retreat at the end of
their leashes on one side of the fire in the
end quadrangle which they skirted an
especially large five-dog team lay by an up-
ended cariole and carlisle pointed them
out to joan

  those big hudsons bays are soaring
eagles dogs he informed her arent
they splendid brutes they weigh one liun-
o

adventure

dredand fifty pounds apiece and theyre
the fastest dogs in my district

  the cree camp-fires winked fainter
behind them and they neared the palisades
of fort wayne upon the snows in front
of the entrance they could see a black figure
pacing up and down and dancing on his
snow-shoes to keep warm the indian guard
posted there to prevent curious huskies from
clawing a way under the gate or unwarned
hunters from inadvertently stumbling into
the plague

  blow your whistle burning cloud
ordered carlisle when the guard challenged

  burning cloud with a grunt of recogni-
tion complied sending a shrill screeching
note through the frosty air the signal for
wayne to come to the entrance the gate
had been fitted with an outside bar for
greater facility in handling and this burn-
ing cloud withdrew swinging the barrier
wide the yellow blotch of an opened door
showed in the post with waynes fur-
capped head touching the top of the seven-
foot doorway as he emerged

  paul are you going to tell him about his
posts and indians joan whispered while
wayne wrapped in a big bearskin coat
crunched across the yard

  i dont know carlisle replied i
thought i might if he asked why
dont tell him she pleaded you
know his nature all gloom and bitterness
and through no molding of his own hes
had too much to bear already with the cut-
ting off of his trade semi-starvation the loss
of his post men and this hateful isolation
here now a new calamity would lie like
a mountain on his spirit to weight him down
please dont tell him paul-yet

  i wont then joan he agreed you
know i dont want to heap trouble on him
hello wayne calling cheerily to tle free-
trader a happy new year to you that
sounds like mockery but i mean as happy
as the circumstances allow thanks to joan
we had a real new years dinner at cumber-
land house and shes brought you your
share

  he stepped forward in the gateway and
hung the basket on a wooden pin

  the same to you carlisle greeted
wayne with simulated cheerfulness tak-
ing the basket down by its thong and
you girl i knew you wouldnt forget me
no no father i couldnt forget you
and i wish this imprisonment were all over

but if youre going to talk a while take the
basket inside first the food was warm
when we left but it will soon freeze

  yes itll soon freeze nodded wayne
somewhat absently but ill take it inside in
a moment i wanted to ask about your
hunters carlisle we saw them making
in to the post today and i thought they
might have heard some news of my own men
from my indians were they in touch with
my tribes at all

  no answered carlisle truthfully
enough my hunters havent been in
touch with your indians they didnt pass
any word with them or with the north-
westers tribes

  ah sighed wayne in disappointment
i didnt know i thought perhaps they
might have but no matter ill send them
word that the plague will soon be over and
theyll be in shortly with their fur
masons getting better then father
cried joan eagerly im so glad

  better echoed wayne with a gloomy
shake of his head he died at dark
high heaven breathed carlisle while
joan clutched his arm with a sob trembling
in her throat thats hard wayne
thats too abominably hard-the last of
your five

  condemnation yes exlaimed wayne
a wave of rebellious despair rising through
his gloomy apathy why couldnt the
plague have taken some of those treacherous
curs who ran away and left me my five true
men by the doom carlisle i sometimes

wonder if there is any-

  hush father dont say that beseeched
joan divining what was in his mind

  what about richelieu asked carlisle
by way of diversion is he getting along
as well as he was

  yes he is theres more irony for you
the wound in his neck is healed and hes
practically over the fever although he com-
plains of weakness in the back and wont
move much off his chair why couldnt
my honest mason be convalescing in his
place and why couldnt the cursed murderer
of mason and the rest be carried out into
the forest tonight

  youre going to take them out tonight
then

  yes andrews says it should be done at
once so as to kill all further risk and he also
says well have to take fresh clothes and
cleansing baths and then put a torch to
ambush



the post its impossible to clean it and i
can soon rebuild with plenty of logs at hand

  yes they must go out tonight the
other four bodies are in the fur-house
andrews and i will carry them of course
but-but could i ask you to make tilings
ready out there carlisle

  yes wayne yes-certainly agreed
carlisle iu go right over to cumberland
house and get the men youll have time
to eat your dinner before were ready
thanks carlisle i havent much appe-
tite but i cant refuse what my girl has
prepared and youd better stay at the
post joan youd better not come into the
forest itll be no sight for young eyes like
yours

  still ill come father declared joan
i would always regret it if i didnt i
loved them all just as you did

  well well whatever you think girl
he nodded turning back into the post in
about an hour or so

the dance was swinging the music
thrilling vibrant lusty care-free
when carlisle and joan returned to
the trading-room of cumberland house but
a word to galt and the shuffling feet stilled
the violins ceased with a whine of protest

  seizing their outer garments the men
followed the chief trader many taking
torches and axes from the store lewis
at carlisles request put his bagpipes under
his arm and all poured out across the snow
to the big clearing in the woods where the
winters fuel had been gathered

  there they set to work under galt lay-
ing dry branches in layers each layer cross-
ing at right angles the one beneath as in the
end towers of the near-by piles of cordwood
upon the branches they heaped the cord-
wood itself lengths of dry dead birch and
resinous pine slivery pitch-soaked ex-
tremely inflammable bulking hugely high
above mens heads

  when the work was nearly finished joan
and carlisle crossed to the gate of the free-
trade post to tell wayne all was ready but
he and andrews were at that moment
coming out of the fur-house doorway which
richelieu held open for them

  the northwester could see the two at the
entrance but he offered no greeting
silently he held the door out of the way and
shambled up the steps with an ax handle
used as a cane to support his weak limbs

closing the door again when wayne and
andrews inched forth their pole stretcher
with the long still figure upon it

  is he coming father whispered joan

  no thank heaven gritted wayne
he says its too cold and too far for him to
walk

  five times they made the out trip four
times the back trip before the row of bodies
upon the pile of cordwood was complete
then carlisles men touched torches to the
bottom branches in many places and step-
ped back as andrews began to read the
burial service

  the flames mounted and grew redden-
ing the snow silhouetting the forest trees
painting the white and indian faces staring
up at the five fever-shattered pox-pitted
rigescent bodies of men who had been true

  the world turned back a thousand years
and like a pagan crowd of ancients the
motley horde of northmen watched the
funeral pyre blaze men and women alike
thronged about all of cumberland house
all of the cree tribes even the old squaws
whose mission it was to tend the fires in the
bivouacs the only two souls missing were
richelieu shut up alone in fort wayne
and burning cloud guarding its open gate

  andrews amen rang out sonorously
across the momentary silence that followed
trembled the throbbing of the fire joans
stifled sobbing the weird of lewis dirge
the wailing death chant of the cree women
while overhead sounded the solemn harp of
the aurora some unseen hand pulsating
its golden strings

 hoo-ah-h-h hoo-ah-h-h the
squaws quavered

  they mourned these true men as they
mourned their own dead of the tribes and
their wailing shrilled eerily in the ears of
wayne and andrews of joan and carlisle
plodding back in pairs toward fort wayne

fipssrg of the four carlisle was the most
mentally alert his was the first
observant glimpse of the fort wayne
gate and as he glimpsed it he gave a star-
tled exclamation and leaped forward in front
of the others no tall dark form showed in
sentinel pose in the opening but prone upon
the snow lay the sprawling figure of a man

  burning cloud burst out carlisle as
he bent over and examined him stunned
with an ax handle look-there it is beside
him in the snow

a
 

adventure

  by the doom exploded wayne rush-
ing up with the rest its richelieus
work the shamming skunk too cold for
him to go into the forest too far to walk
eh condemnation hes been biding his
time just waiting his chance carlisle and
ive given it to him

  but where under the dome of heaven
does he hope to hide paul demanded
andrews breathlessly

  carlisle was reading the signs he saw
where burning cloud had been standing
upon a drift the toes of his snow-shoes
pointing forestward no doubt staring at the
distant glare of the funeral pyre and listen-
ing to the death chant of his people when he
was struck down by a blow from behind

  his rifle and snow-shoes were gone and
carlisle bent double as he scanned the crust
nosed about like a hound to find the tracks
of the shoes striking out from the muddle
of prints about the gateway

  they were the long slim shoes of the
cree runner there had been no others like
them near fort wayne that day and pres-
ently carlisle discovered where they had
struck the softer snows in a scent-breaking
fifteen-foot jump out from the packed area
about the entrance

  no weak mans jump that he pointed
out to the rest and those strides arent
the strides of a weak man either

  he indicated the marks of richelieus
shoes where the northwester had run upon
the tracks he and joan had made in coming
over from cumberland house it was plain
that richelieus purpose had been to con-
fuse trails and throw any tracker off the
scent but carlisle was never at fault

  he skimmed rapidly ahead joan glid-
ing at his side wayne and andrews keep-
ing their distance farther back but equally
anxious to see the results of the trailing

  the tracks led straight toward the cree
bivouacs toward the snow-walled quadran-
gles glowing pink under the blazing fires
within

  hes hiding in the teepees somewhere
joan breathed carlisle waiting till the
woods are clear youd better drop back
hes armed and hell likely shoot on sight
then carlisles shoes struck the snow-
banked side of the end quadrangle sending
the flakes hissing into the fire and instan-
taneously the truth struck home to him
there had not been a hunter or a squaw in the
whole camp to menace or alarm a pillager

  soaring eagles dogs the splendid one-
hundred-and-fifty-pound hudsons bays
the swiftest dogs in carlisles district the
animals no other post team could pretend
to overtake were gone from their former
place by the fire

  soaring eagles up-ended cariole too was
gone and yonder was the white furrow of it
streaking off in the direction that led up the
saskatchewan

  escaped breathed joan but be
careful paul maybe he has spread the
plague here as he tried to do once be-
fore

  no thank heaven his tracks dont go
any farther than this fire he hadnt time
to enter the main bivouac you see joan
it took him all his time to get the harness
on those five big brutes and get away he
has barely done it for the cariole furrow
hasnt yet hardened in the frost

chapter xii

the sorcery of spring

winters waning they sensed first in
the flutter of ptarmigan flocks back
from the takipi hills in the drift of the
phantom caribou herds down from the
barren lands in the lengthening days the
receding horizon which drew away into in-
finite remoteness the rampant winds which
snow-smoked that far horizon but died
in a strange vacuum over the bosom of
pine island lake itself

  all about cumberland house the north-
ern world burned incandescent lurid shot
through and through earth air and sky
with weird shafts of color the snows were
billowy seas of coral with the bloody sun-
sets lying on them like islands of rubies

  the atmosphere was a mystic veil today
a shower of diamond dust tomorrow a sil-
ver vapor the next day the gossamer cloak
of a sleeping glacier chrysoberyl-stained
upon a web of hoar frost and sheer from
the dome of heaven to the line of the snows
banked the deep purple clouds like regal
hangings in an ancient temple with the mock
suns peering through as eyes of the priests
of the sacrifice were wont to peer

  yet there came no vernal transition no
slow travail of nature bringing forth new
life only the purple tapestries and the
peering eyes dissolved one day and in their
place floated turquoise skies and cirrous
ambush



clouds painted with the eeriest sight north-
ern eyes may see

  joan was the first to notice straying to
the door of the factors house while her
father andrews and carlisle talked and
smoked the bright evening away before the
fireplace in the council room

  now the sun set late jealous daylight
claimed many hours of the former dark
and upon this evening the low sun was
screened behind a fan of ground fog shoot-
ing up a half-circle of crimson spokes
rimmed by a golden felloe yet it was not
the fantastic sunset but the weird sky itself
that called forth joans excited cry and
brought the others to her side

  look she murmured in a tone of awe
did you ever see such unnatural beauty
by heavens a mirage exclaimed car-
lisle a mirage of the south

  for before their uplifted eyes as if it
lay out yonder upon the bare snows or just
over the needle-tufted pines stretched the
open waters of the great lakes and the
verdant land to the southward what a
charm of color what a mellow sweep of
warmth they beheld

  chrysoprase green the waters shimmered
frothed with the crests of the surges edged
with the pearly foam of pounded beaches
while afar spread the silver ribbons of rivers
the fat grassed fields the groves of leafed
trees the acres of orchard bloom almost
could they hear the cries of children at play
under the showering petals catch the drone
of the hived bees feel the hot-lipped south-
ern winds kissing their faces like the pas-
sionate caress of their own febrile chinook

  its spring declared carlisle its
blossomy spring down there

  yes its spring on the wyoming valley
-see urged wayne his fawn-green eyes
burning raptly has abnormally long arm
pointing out his homeland in the sky pic-
ture as one would lay a finger upon an un-
rolled map its spring and its a sign
by the doom a sign that im going back
carlisle and andrews were silent

  the tears flooded to joans eyes

  they all stared mutely while the mirage
faded as quickly as it had appeared and
somber clouds slipped over with the motion
of a hand wiping away the drawing from
a slate

  waynes eye went dark with the sky
he groped for the doorway as they turned
nside and sat down in his chair before the

fireplace his head in his hands gazing into
the glowing embers as one who sees old
scenes in pageant

  within an hour the rain came the warm
steaming smiting rain that had lurked for
weeks in the purple cloud banks and all
night it poured gushed fell in torrents
sweeping the snows like a magic broom
brimming ice-bound lake and river with the
leaping waters of life

  companioning it came the chinook
stealing a march in the dark ravishing the
naked woods stirring the pulse primordial
in the heart of the waking earth

  morning revealed a world aflood the ice
jams flying the saskatchewan in rampage
hurling the glut of a thousand streams down
to lake winnipeg spring it burst like
prison doors for prisoners long confined
it came like a swift reprieve to mourners
of one doomed spring the air was one
vast flyway of wildfowl winging north

  as rivers run to the sea as men seek their
own hearth fires so these whizzing wedges
returned to the nests that fledged them the
ducks to their million marshes the canada
geese to their hudsons bay shores the
wavies to their nameless arctic islands

  while the ice runs reeled along the wil-
lows budded beside them while the mus-
kegs shed their frozen skins the wild rose
clothed their starkness while the melting
snows uncarpeted the forest floor the
nymph-like flowers spread over it their rugs
of matchless hue spring the incompar-
able thrill and verve and urge of it it
surged in all living tilings from the human
occupants of cumberland house to the
singing bluebirds in the tree tops and the
whining mosquitoes in the swamp

     i the breaking of the forest trails
meant the cutting off of all commun-
ication in the northland till the
floods had subsided sufficiently for the frail
canoes to breast them carlisle had had
no word from james bay if word had not
been sent out by trippers before the snows
broke it might not arrive in time to let
him know the situation in the other dis-
tricts the lack of such knowledge was
a severe handicap

  the governor always kept his promises
strictly and he wondered what had hap-
pened to prevent a message getting through
but even while lie worried a lone indian
canoeman daring the running ice drove


adventure

up the saskatchewan over the lessening
flood and threw a dispatch bag upon
carlisles desk

  you are flaming torch from the bay
post of york factory identified carlisle
scanning him keenly but you have not
come from the bay by canoe i know that

  no explained flaming torch i
came by dog-team the trail was slow with
the melting snows and the floods caught
me at the pas i had to wait for the ice
to run then i came on with a canoe from
the post

  stay here carlisle directed him i
may have a message to send back right
away

  he knew wayne and andrews were out
somewhere along the swollen river so he
took the dispatches over to his house to
have privacy while reading them but when
he opened the council room door joan sat
there

  what is it paul she asked looking
up from the book she was reading

  dispatches he replied with satisfac-
tion ive looked for them a long time
dont let me disturb you though go on
with your reading ill just glance over
them and get the news

  most of them were documents of the
ordinary post routine things that would
come under the jurisdiction and execution
of galt and his clerks but finally he came
to one of greater import

  the sweeping chirography he recognized
as the governors own handwriting and
it was addressed chief district factor
carlisle cumberland house cumberland
district via norway house also it was
marked important and carlisle tore it open
with eager hands it was written in con-
versational style and the body of it ran

  all the upper country is a hell of smallpox
between that and trade war all of the free-trade
and the majority of the northwest posts are wiped
out as far as the latest dispatches by runners
point out the northwest posts of james and rod-
erick mckenzie mcleod mcdougall todd mc-
gillivray and sager are the only ones left these
posts are very strong as many of the other posts
evacuated and fell in on them

   i have temporarily closed all our posts in the
infected districts and freighted out the fur by the
churchill river using dog teams for the purpose be-
fore the river broke the northwesters have made
no move and beyond a doubt the mckenzies and
the rest will try to come down the saskatchewan
as usual in the spring

   you must stop them they must not go through

i hope you are strong enough as you stand and have
escaped the plague if not i can perhaps get you
reinforcements up in time everything here on the
bay is much the same the past winter has been
a severe one and it may be i shall not endure an-
other my health is failing greatly and i think i
may ask for a change in the spring let me know
your prospects by the runner who carries this

   as carlisle raised his eyes from his reading
he caught the gaze of joan bent upon him
across the table

  what is the news paul she asked
earnestly is it betraying confidences or
trade secrets to tell me

  no joan theres nothing in it you
shouldnt know about he assured her
handing the dispatch over the board
you may read it for yourself im sorry
it confirms our worst news about your
fathers posts soaring eagles words were
true theyre all gone it seems the
northwesters fared somewhat better

  joan quickly read the dispatch and
carlisle saw the soft gleam of commisera-
tion spring into her eyes

  i was afraid-so dreadfully afraid
she exclaimed now i know i know
what i havent the heart to tell him but
it doesnt make any mention of richelieu
paul do you think hell have reached any
of these posts that remain unaffected

  he has certainly reached one of them
carlisle emphatically declared he had
the very best of dogs and it wouldnt take
him long to reach say todds post

  then perhaps hell warn them not to
come down the saskatchewan perhaps
theyll try some other ruse or else hold
their furs over for another year

  carlisle shook his head

  they wont do that he prophesied
furs held over are not so profitable as if
marketed at once then they have to
go to grande portage for next years sup-
plies besides richelieu is a bully and a
fighter no coward whatever nobody need
warn him off and he wont warn anybody
else off

  even if any of the other partners object
and want to play a safer game hell smash
their objections i know simon richelieu
hell come and hell have all the north-
west brigades under his command further
than that joan dont you realize how much
depends on my scattering his brigades here

if i should lose-

  dont paul dont mention that pos-
sibility cried joan
ambush

  she was half out of her chair her face all
flushed leaning over the table toward him
her hands planted on the litter of dispatches

  dont mention it please it would
bring misfortune im sure ive learned
to be superstitious in this north you see
yes i was a fool to say he wouldnt come
he will come and paul paul-you must
not lose

  carlisles fingers closed on hers outspread
upon the papers

 by the god of northmen joan he
vowed i will not lose

  the magnetic pressure of his hands told
more than the mere words joan with
a radiant smile slowly withdrew her hands
and dropped back into her chair still fol-
lowing his movements with her eyes as he
set about writing the answer to the govern-
ors despatch

ffjg when he had finished he looked

       up-

would you like to read it joan

he asked

  yes i would like to paul she con-
fessed that is if it is the same as the other
-if it is proper that i should read it

its all right for you to see it girl here

  joan took the paper and read

  i have your dispatch via norway house al-
though it was somewhat delayed en route the
break-up of the river caught the courier at the pas
and he had to lie up with the dogs and come on at
the first opportunity by canoe this circumstance
would have made it a question whether reinforce-
ments could have reached here in time had i needed
them but luckily i do not

  besides my own men galts strong following
which was here when i arrived and the crews of
the two fleets of york boats whom i have retained
i am drawing in all the forces of the other posts with
all the indians of those sections the indians are
loyal and numerous and thus i shall have a prepond-
erance of men as regards the smallpox it has been
here in fact it started here in a manner i shall
explain when i reach james bay

  both northwesters and free-traders fled from it
burning richelieus post as they fled except riche-
lieu wayne and five of waynes men in isolation
at fort wayne the five free-traders died with it
richelieu recovering and managing to escape up the
saskatchewan fort wayne we fired so as to leave
no possibility of the disease spreading here

  i have given wayne quarters at cumberland
house although we thought it best not to tell him
the extent of his losses yet he is such a strange
and moody man there has been no infection at
cumberland house everything is in the usual
shape and fur has been plentiful i shall stop the
northwest brigades here and then go down to
grande portage



  the northwesters have claimed the ground there
and closed the portage and thus the pigeon river
route to any but their own voyageu i myself
had to make a dash up the kaministiquia coming in
you can understand that it is supremely in our
interests to contest that claim without delay be-
fore undisputed closing of it gives them excuse for
holding it under a ruling of the corrupt montreal
courts

   so i shall pass over the ground to void the claim
and come home to the bay via the michipicoten
the missinabie and the moose i am sorry to hear
you have been troubled in health but trust to find
you much improved when next i pay my respects

  well joan he questioned when she
looked up with the light of surprise upon her
face

  you are going down to grande portage
paul i thought you would go down to
james bay by the hayes river

  no he responded if i stopped riche-
lieus brigades here and then went down the
hayes my work would be only half done
i am going to open up grande portage and
by the god of northmen joan you are
going with me

  that day the courier flaming torch
departed down the river the next day
the men of the other posts came up lewis
from the pas lea from the nepowin
garry from moose lake hampton from
chimawawin jarvis from grand rapids

  they brought all the indians of their
sections to add to carlisles strength and
jarvis his cockney nose tilted skyward
in pride drove up with his own crew the
factors great craft which had been left
at grand rapids when the river froze

  see the bloomin rajah ride he grinned
doffing his cap to the crowd on shore
some dy ill command one of my own
just mark wot i sy

  he had with him soaring eagles tribe
the up-saskatchewan indians who had
elected to hunt about lake winnipeg when
driven out by the plague laden with a fresh
catch of fur the fur went in in trade and
these were the busy hours hours filled with
life and movement sound and color after
the ghostly desolation and silence of the
winter

  never an hour went by day or night but
some new fleet of canoes touched prows
upon the pine island lake shore some new
family pitched camp and swelled the teepee
city round about cumberland house

  out of the eastern and western arms
they came off the sturgeon and the carrot
rivers from lakes namew amisk goose


adventure

athapuscow foregathering after custom
immemorial spiraling the blazing skies
with their camp smokes filling the balmy
air with liquid language that lisped like the
moist spring wind or gurgled like the waters

  they were all in every man upon the
trade books every hudsons bay hunter
in the district with their squaws papooses
dogs and household gods the only out-
post remaining was wells camp on the
seepanock channel

  wells men carlisle had not drawn in
like the others on the contrary he had
added to the seepanock channel force
bidding wells redouble his vigilance with
the opening of the stream and giving him
explicit orders as to what course he must
pursue when the northwesters came down

  nor was the significance of these prepara-
tions lost upon wayne they marked as
it were the breaking of the truce enforced
between him and carlisle by the smallpox
outbreak they loomed upon his concep-
tion as a final menace to his interests and
he became morose moody brooding over
carlisles actions and his ancient wrongs
watching for the free-trading brigades
he hoped to see come driving down the
saskatchewan and grimly waiting for that
moment when there would be no further
truce and he and carlisle must decisively
settle accounts

the ice run was practically past
vagrant floes spun by on the turgid
waters but their very solitary journ-
eying told carlisle that the mighty highway
was open even back to the tiniest feeders
in the foothills of the rockies the way was
clear and the northwesters were doubtless
driving down they might come by day-
light or dark today tomorrow there
was no telling but it was well to be pre-
pared

  carlisle went up to the seepanock chan-
nel and personally posted wells men both
in the -hills across the saskatchewan and
in the low scrub round the channel opening
itself a mile inland the channel had been
heavily barricaded as a necessary precau-
tion but no evidence of hudsons bay
forces being in possession was visible from
the main stream

  keep out of sight carlisle adjured
wells dont let them get a glimpse of
any of your men if they enter the chan-
nel rush and hold them till i can get up the

river to help you if they go by make sure
that it is not a ruse and then follow them
on to me as fast as you can

  yez factor wells assured him i
zhall make zertain o that you zhall
zee

  carlisle dropped down-stream again be-
low the muddle of straggling islands be-
low the scramble of rapids below the twisted
knot of river bends known as the coiled
snakes to a spit where the saskatchewan
narrowed not a great distance from cumber-
land house

  here the park lands met the ruder forest
in a series of rolling bluffs and low plateaus
a bold promontory crowding the river into
a twisted somber chasm close by the rim
of the chasm and up on the slopes shouldered
the jostling spruce and against these high
trees carlisle sent his men with their axes

  to the swinging steel the spruce trees
swung and snapped plunging like the
thrown spears of titans into the river be-
neath they criss-crossed and lodged and
jammed piling trunk on trunk seineing
the vagrant floes that drifted down form-
ing a stubborn wall against the angry roar-
ing river

  the dammed flood rose a foot two feet
three feet but the matted barrier held
while high above carlisle and his axmen
rained down the trunks till the sullen tide
backed round the face of the promontory
and gave up the fight beaten it slunk out
the easier way over the bank through the
devils elbow a broad barren valley that
seemed to have been an ancient beaver
meadow

  owing to the width of the valley the
yellow flood flowed no deeper than a mans
waist sweeping in a majestic curve of three
miles or more back to the well-nigh drained
saskatchewans bed as the waters rolled
ruminatively through they raised some-
thing inch by inch upon their rippling sur-
face a dark line across the molten gold
a triple boom of logs securely roped to giant
pines on either benchland

  ralph wayne heard the axes ringing
saw the saskatchewan temporarily draining
and ran out-to where carlisle was at work
he glimpsed the dammed chasm the boom
of logs across the devils elbow and his
fawn-green eyes blazed with their old inim-
ical light into carlisles

  condemnation you close the saskatch-
ewan carlisle he exploded
ambush



  so it seems wayne returned carlisle
quietly

  to my brigades

  no to the northwest brigades

  but whats the difference you close
the waterway and you stop all who travel
down by the doom do you think i will
stand and by and see it done

  carlisles gray eyes looked steadily into
waynes blazing ones where he stood upon
the end of the boom and as he gazed the
factor seemed to see back into those far-
gone years which had molded the man so
harshly

  with strange occult vision he saw the
pall of smoke and the sweep of pillage
through the wyoming valley and waynes
long pilgrimage into the north with his
child of four he sensed the vision and
dream that had lured wayne in his loneli-
ness to do what many another adventurer
had failed to do to blaze the trail of empire
beyond the missouri

  carlisle saw felt the greatness of waynes
dissolving dream and there was no emnity
in his heart nothing but regret and pity
and he laid an earnest hand on the free-
traders arm

 on my honor wayne this move has
nothing to do with you he assured him

  you wont try to hold my brigades
then flashed the incredulous wayne
youll let them pass around when they
come

  carlisle hesitated then nodded helplessly
if-if they come he evaded ill put
out no hand to stop them

  if blurted wayne what in creation
have you up your sleeve do you think my
men arent as loyal as yours just because
some of the drunken curs joined in the rout
like sheep when they got the smallpox scare
you neednt class them all as that look at
mason look at murdock and the rest
had you ever truer men under your red flag
no none truer than those admitted
carlisle none truer in all the world for
that matter

  wayne shrugged his shoulders darkly as
he turned away again

  then that settles it he growled
theyll come all right and when they
take passage through here they take it for

all time carlisle either that or-

  he finished his sentence with a shake of
his head that was more sinister than any
spoken threat

  gravely without answering his threat
carlisle watched him striding back to the
post before he turned to give final directions
to his men some dozen he appointed to
work in two shifts walking the triple boom
with poles in their hands deflecting the
drifting ice so that it would squeeze under
and leave the barrier clear

  the rest he split into two camps to
bivouac upon the benchlands at either end
of the boom ready at the coming of the
sleepless scouts he had posted here and
there all the way up-river to the seepanock
channel there was nothing more to be
done but wait the long twilight of the
northern evening had crept in upon the
completion of the days work and through
the dusk carlisle followed in waynes
footsteps back to cumberland house

in the deepest dark before the
dawn wells scout spotted deer a
cree indian of tremendous endur-
ance and skill fell in upon him breathless
and sweating

  they come he grunted in cree spent
with his running many canoes many
voices of white men the french companys
men singing to their paddles

  instantly wells struck fire with his flint
and steel to the dry birchbark heaped be-
side him on the hillside and blew it into
flame

  the flare was hidden by the bulge of the
hill from any one up-river but could be
readily seen by an appointed eye in an ap-
pointed place down-river as wells strained
his eyes into the dark he caught the an-
swering flare a mile or two below a bright
flame and unmistakable but no larger than
a handful of fireflies held on high by a spor-
tive boy

  immediately wells smothered his flame
with earth and far down he saw the second
flare go out and knew that his message was
speeding swifter than the swiftest bird

  all the way along the saskatchewan
from island to island from headland to
headland from hill to hill the red eyes
glowed and winked out in the dark and the
last one glared for waseyawin stationed
upon the steep benchland above the hud-
sons bay mens bivouacs swiftly wase-
yawin lit his torch and waved it in answer
the far spark died in the gloom he
dashed the torch into the soft muck and
bounded down the hillside


adventure

  the men of black-beard are coming
he cried to the drowsy camp the sign
of the fire flashed through the night to me
they will be here with the winged dawn i
waseyawin have spoke it ae and i go
to tell the factor

  like wraiths the hudsons bay men
arose from wherever they lay from bough
beds on the ground from the canopy of the
bushes from the tents spread in desperation
to keep off the plague of mosquitoes

  they stepped forth shadowy vague
thronging like ghosts in the dark that would
soon break to show the stern bronzed faces
of northmen sculptured by the chisel of
daring among them the chief trader galt
moved his heavily-built body ordering
directing posting them in their allotted
positions

  go across the valley eugene he begged
drummond and let them know what we
know it is good to be ready when the
factor comes

  amid the low musical night-roar of the
waters flowing under the boom and the
spaced thud of ice cakes smiting the logs
drummonds moccasins pat-patted across
on the wet bark he gave the word to the
polers as he passed and in a few minutes
more ghostly forms were thronging in the
bivouac at the other end of the boom

  waseyawin waited for none of these
things he ran as the deer run the tang
of the dank night air and the smell of the
young earth throbbing in his nostrils and
setting his primitive blood a-leap making
straight for cumberland house

  up the trampled shore he sped and
through the sleeping city of teepees setting
the curs to howling and stirring the tribes
from their dreaming of forest dreams
they cried out to him to know if he was
maunobosho or nenaubosho stalking
through the night but he heeded them not

  through the open gate of the palisades
he darted and across the dark stockade
ground he knew there was no use in
going to the factors house for he had seen
that only wayne his daughter and father
andrews were sleeping there the factors
bed was in the trading-room and dispens-
ing with all custom in the urgency of the
moment waseyawin sprang up the steps
and opened the door

  carlisle lay upon the temporary bed be-
hind his desk sunk in a deep sleep after the
long days toil he did not hear the almost

soundless feet of his bowsman did not
wake till he felt the indian fingers laid
softly and respectfully upon his cheek

  koos koos kwa factor cried wase-
yawin wake up the eyes of fire winked
through the dark to me and after the eyes
will the sun flash upon the paddles of the
men of the french company

  it is well waseyawin spoke carlisle
in cree mentally alert the moment he was
awake go among your people in their
teepees and gather the hunters take them
with you to the devils elbow to strengthen
my men i will not be far behind you

a skin for a skin

making ready his weapons as he
went carlisle ran forth from the trad-
ing-room the stars were gone as he
glanced upward the sky was graying and
above the eastern forest-line the lemon
forelights of the dawn were gleaming

  outside the stockade the indian teepees
buzzed like a vast colony of bees wasey-
awin had already hurried the hunters away
but their womenkind were hissing the news
of impending trouble about and scurrying
off to the slope above the devils elbow
where they might see their lords give battle
carlisles swift feet passed many of them on
the way and as he came to the steep of the
benchland the vivid picture of the valley
below spread sharp and clear before his eyes

  through the great gut of greening hills
along their scarred earth faces rocky out-
crops and scrubby slopes rolled the slum-
brous sheet of golden-colored water its
vagrant floes had found the gouged earth
an easy place to lodge and there shimmer-
ing acres of ice were stranded ghostly white
in the growing light above hung the furry
buds and opened leaves of the willows the
lacy climbing birches and over all the
regal scornful spruce pricking stiffly into
the lemon sky

  clusters of tents marked the ends of the
boom drawn like a black triple cable across
the golden flood and fretting it into a snarl-
ing line of foam where the flow plunged
under round the tents and scattered
across the long boom he marked his wait-
ing forces all the swarthy hunters wasey-
awin had marshaled all the hudsons bay
white men half-breeds and resident indians
ambush



of cumberland house and the other district
posts

 yonder was waseyawin himself moving
on the boom with the snaky slouch of the
crees missowa the ojibway standing tall
strong straight as a lance

  there were all the rest of his officers posed
on the logs their physical characteristics
infallibly betraying their identities even at
that distance-galts stocky body drum-
monds eagle profile and raven hair lewis
hoary head leas slim highland figure
jarvis nervous shuffle hamptons fleshy
bulk garrys squat limbs and flaming red
beard

 even as he looked carlisle saw eugene
point up the majestic curve of the devils
elbow saw the hands of the row of men on
the boom drop to their hips and belts and
curl up under their armpits for the handy
weapons there was something coming on
the rolling flood the output of the pines
across the shoulder of the slope shut out his
own view of the curve but carlisle knew
that eugene and the rest had sighted their
enemies

  in long slipping coasting strides he slid
down the benchland upon his wet moccasins
and ran out on the boom beside his brigade
leader

 ba gar here dey be come shrilled
eugene still pointing and carlisle sighted
over his hand to glimpse the northwest
brigades sweeping round the promontory

 the jam of trees and ice in the narrow
chasm was not the first jam they had avoid-
ed in their long journey down that roaring
waterway they followed the saskatche-
wan wherever it went and in the natural
diversion of things they came driving over
the broad unobstructed yellow flood that
eddied round the devils elbow

black as stygian craft the canoes
loomed in the shadow of the head-
land but as they passed the head-
land the first sapphire shafts of the
dawnlight struck them glinting from the
canoe sides flashing from the dipping pad-
dles paradoxically investing the white and
indian faces with nebulous pearly haloes

 in the sudden blaze of light carlisle
recognized the faces the men of every craft
james and roderick mckenzie mcleod
and mcdougall with their athabasca
brigades todd from fort des prairies
mcgillivray and sager from fond du lac

the governors information had been
accurate not a man he had named was
missing

  todds canoe was in front and as it
approached the boom carlisle saw a man
rise to his feet and plant a flagstaff in the
curving bow

  the banner of the northwesters broke on
the morning wind and behind its rippling
folds he beheld richelieu stiff as a ramrod
in the swaying craft resplendent in his
uniform of a colonel his grinning black-
bearded face hideously pox-pitted more like
the face of the devil than ever

  long live the northwest company
he cried and like an echo his forces took up
the northwest watchcry fortitude in
distress their cheering drowning the roar-
ing of the river

  carlisle stooped to pick up a spike-ended
shaft that lay at his feet on the boom with
a strong darting thrust he drove the spike
into the logs and the shaft oscillated there
shaking out the blood-red emblem of the
hudsons bay company and carlisles own
streaming gonfalon the gonfalon that had
come undimmed through fire and flood
through famine and plague through all the
hazards of the northland

  pro belle cuteml he shouted antago-
nistically and the bellow of the hudsons
bay giants set the high hill-tops quaking

  long live the northwest company

  a skin for a skin they boomed in a
diapason of terrible strength long live
the h b c

  by the doom yes and to perdition with
richelieu and his cursed northwesters
shrilled a wild voice ashore

  carlisle glanced over his shoulder to see
the tall form of wayne dashing out upon
the boom and behind him joan her pale
face paler with excitement her spun-gold
hair flying in the breeze calling him back in
vain behind joan ran andrews holding
the skirts of his cassock his mosquito-veil
flapping over his face at every stride

  wayne impetuously zigzagged through
the line of men to carlisles side his
mahogany countenance was ridged with
anger his fawn-green eyes sparking wick-
edly

  condemnation carlisle he burst out
yesterday i never dreamed i would fight
under your flag today what is left for
me to do look at my brigade leaders
yonder one two-six of them from the


adventure

upper country posts pointing them out
with rapid stabs of his rifle muzzle speck-
led through richelieus crew like the pits in
his face and when my brigade leaders
paddle in his pay carlisle i ask you where
in creation are my brigades

  sleeping under the green ferns ralph
richelieu answered swiftly before carlisle
could speak

  you cursed slime who put them
there flashed wayne

  richelieu stiffly shrugged his military
shoulders

  diablement do i control the elements
and the plagues the red death raged
and the red death took whom it wished
voilal it is the will of god but my
quarrel is not with you ralph wayne
non nor with mademoiselle joan i will
have a word to your profit with both of you
when i have finished with this cannaille
carlisle broken his barrier and razed his
post to the ground

  wayne half-lifted his rifle stock to his
cheek

  by the doom-will you have a word
with us

  carlisle pressed waynes rifle barrel
down

  this is my business wayne he warned
the free-trader keep your weapons
still get joan back to the shore end
yonder she may be carried into the water
if they tty a rush

  carlisle half-turned to enforce his re-
quest on wayne for the instant lessening
his vigilance and in that moment of un-
wariness richelieu thought to seize the
advantage

  holat he shouted loudly to his brigades
form the line

        like lightning the paddles urged
s the hindmost canoes drawing up on
ebb a level with the foremost edging in
bellying sidewise jockeying like race-horses
at the barrier forming an unbroken line
from shore to shore all in a second they
executed the maneuver with two or three
darting paddle-flips and as the prows
evened and still glided in swift motion
richelieu waved them forward

  charge he ordered and hurled them on
with a violent gesture of his arm as if they
had been a squadron in action

  like charging cavalry the canoes leaped
ahead like immense horses carrying many

riders the foam streaking from their noses
the spray spattering behind them richelieu
towering in the bow of todds craft as on
the neck of a charger leading them reck-
lessly like the fearless soldier he was and
whipping them to frenzy with the stinging
lash of his tongue

  straight at the boom they reared but
carlisle sensed their trick a canoes
length away the whole array would swerve
broadside on and spill the northwesters out
on the boom with momentum enough to
carry all before them and sweep the hud-
sons bay forces into the water

  richelieu was shrewd enough not to mass
his attack in one spot but to batter the whole
boom simultaneously his force was al-
most equal to carlisles and he knew that
the swift rush of the canoes would dash his
men upon the boom with a smashing impact
that no merely stationary force could with-
stand it would be like a single line of
infantry before galloping horsemen over-
ridden crushed shattered by sheer impetus

  he knew that carlisle knew it too and
he passed a quick order along the line

  shoot once he commanded then
jump for their canoes before they reach the
boom

  yelling demoniacally the northwesters
were driving in only a few yards distant
todds canoe was surging fairly for carlisle
richelieu still upright in the bow the flap-
ping folds of the flag partly hiding his body
but the ugly black-bearded face showing
clear above his mocking eyes gleaming over
the barrel of the pistol he held in his hand

  par dieu carlisle he grinned it is
the end for you the end of everything the
end of your strife your company your
dream of mademoiselle

  carlisle did not trouble to answer his
own pistol in his hand he waited his eyes
never shifting from richelieu his body
slightly bent forward from the hips his
moccasined feet gripping the wet bark of
the logs

  when the canoes were still two paddle-
strokes away he saw the muzzle of richer
lieus pistol flip upward caught the puff of
smoke heard the weapons bark felt the
wind of the silent lead through his hair and
its burning groove along his scalp

  straight into the black-bearded face he
fired but the swaying flagstaff snapped
while richelieu still grinned there mock-
ingly sardonically sighting ills pistol afresh
ambush



in the rocking craft but before either he
or carlisle could shoot again waynes long-
barreled rifle spat from the boom

  faint as a squib it went off at carlisles
ear in concert with the hudsons bay mens
volley but the effect was contrastingly
violent richelieu his weapon dropping
with a splash whirled halfwayround as if
spun by an invisible hand todds canoe
was just in the act of turning a broadside on
to the boom and the jerk catapulted the
staggering richelieu out of the swerving
canoe bow

  he landed limply half in the water half
on the boom carlisle had a momentary
glance of andrews dragging his body out on
the logs of wayne jamming in another
charge of the white-faced joan beside him
as he leaped from the boom before todds
canoe could touch it

  all along the line the others leaped with
him and they landed with a wallowing
splash close under the northwesters whirl-
ing canoes the hudsons bay men knew
the depth of the water a knowledge that
their enemies lacked and therein lay their
advantage and carlisles strategy the
total unexpectedness of the move lent it
all the greater force and the number of
carlisles officers distributed throughout
the line ensured perfect unison of effort

  galt drummond lewis jarvis hamp-
ton garry lea missowa and waseyawin
and the lesser clerks were personally respon-
sible for the men undertheir command and
they saw to it that all moved in concert

  thus it was an unbroken row of men that
barred an unbroken row of canoes before
the occupants of the canoes could jump
from craft to boom and seized their low-
sunk gunwales the clear-headed todd
smelled disaster the moment the hudsons
bay men launched through the air

  hades look out he yelled to the
ether partners back-water all

  but carlisle was too swift for him a
whirl of the factors hands and todds
canoe was upside down the fur packs on the
bottom todd and his crew floundering in
the water

  todd came up sputtering and cursing
his rifle-butt smashed down on carlisles
shoulder but carlisle skimmed the surface
with a fist blow that caught todd upon the
chin and stretched him limp and floating
scattering the indian crew he lunged on to
overturn the nearest craft

  nor had his men been idle everywhere
he looked he saw the northwest canoes
either capsized or in the act of being cap-
sized by his men up to their waists
sometimes to their armpits in the icy water
they offered small targets for northwest
violence while the canoes were easy prey

  often top-heavy with crews and packs of
fur always hair-poised on their keelless
bottoms the birch-barks went over at the
touch of a hand the poke of a knee or the
solid push of a gun-butt

it was a weird sight to behold
whole brigades suddenly turning
turtle heeling on their gunwales
rearing up on their sterns spilling and
sprawling arms gear men and furs in all
directions

  some of the hudsons bay men in then-
savage zeal paused not for the laying on of
hands but struck through the birch-bark
skins of the canoes with knives and belt
axes scuttling the crafts at a stroke sending
the paddlers under like mannikins in a
biscuit-box

  bitter was the amphibious battle through
which carlisle rampaged though they
had lost their canoes the northwesters
found their footing and resisted tenaciously
many of their arms were sunk in the plunge
more they saved were plugged with mud and
slime so that there was little shooting

  they fought as their forefathers fought
with knife and club and knotted fist a primi-
tive horde battling like cavemen in the
wilderness raging in the churned moiled
river between steep benchlands under the
blazing sun

  high on those benchlands clustered the
womenkind of the tribes in action all gay-
clothed in their calicoes bright-cowled in
their warm-colored shawls the squaws the
boys the maidens the moss-bagged papoos-
es even the husky dogs of the camp snarling
and clipping their fangs over the conflict
in the water below

  in that wild moment the women far for-
got their race stoicism and shrilled encour-
agement to their hunters waved their gaudy
silk handkerchiefs beseeching their good
spirit to help the hudsons bay calling on
their evil one to blast the bold north-
westers

  the hunters answered their cries with
strident yells their wet swarthy arms
glistening like bronze in the sunlight as led


adventure

by missowa and waseyawin they carried
the fight more fiercely to their foes the
northwesters were beaten back from the
boom they hoped to break carlisle at the
head of his men seized mcleod and bodily
hurled him out on the farther shore

  get the partners he shouted above the
crazy din smash the other partners and
the whole crowd will break

  are ye no seein i ha got ane rum-
bled lewis sloshing in the water like a
hippopotamus

  he had a neck-hold on mcgillivray and
even though sager leaped upon his back he
staggered out to the shallows cast mcgil-
livray into the saskatoon bushes like a
discarded sack and tore sager off as a man
would pluck a climbing cat

  ane an twa he amended where
are yon ithers

  ba gar here-dese two chuckled
drummond as he and galt backed the
mckenzies out on to the stranded ice-cakes
with their hammering gun-butts

  jarvis was smiting mcdougall with his
fists fighting as he had fought many a lon-
don street fight in the years that were gone
he struck the northwester at will upon the
face and neck all that showed above the
rippling surface but without warning
mcdougall drove his knee under water into
jarvis stomach and jarvis staggered
violently back against the boom

  mcdougall turned and madly splashed
ashore while jarvis gazed after him with a
surprise and agony on his cockney face

  stryke me blind in the blinkers thats
a foul i sy he gasped and promptly col-
lapsed across the logs

  up-river a tremendous shout burst out
carlisle wheeled waist-deep and a trium-
phant laugh broke from him

  wells is coming he encouraged his
men now all together give them
blue perdition

  wells fleet was swinging round the
devils elbow at a dizzy speed the canoes
boring forward in long jumps throwing the
water aside in rolling ridges the paddles
making the surface boil they cheered
as they came all the loud-throated men of
the seepanock channel all the river
scouts he had picked up on his way
down

  skin for skin they roared to their
battling fellows and immersed warriors
found breath to answer back

  long live the h b c

  fresh and strong and numerous wells
force struck the northwesters in the back
and under the pressure of his advance they
scattered for the shore like a herd of caribou
to join their beaten leaders heading the
rout carlisle saw a bedraggled figure he
recognized the hawk-nosed dentaire with
his mustaches plastered over his cheeks

  by jove there he is carlisle cried
look eugene look galt dentaire-
you remember did you ever know the
like of that ready to die of fear of small-
pox and never got it

  dentaire heard carlisles laugh and took
it for an imputation on his bravery

  bon dim can we fight enemies with our
backs as well as our fronts also it is of a
circumstance condemnable that our leaders
run away its all over with us

  he gesticulated frantically while all the
other partners cursed him as they drew out
the injured todd and many more before
they broke and clawed a way up over the
benchland and off through the park lands

  missowa waseyawin carlisle or-
dered take the indian hunters and
trail them well clear of the river without
canoes or many arms theyll have to beat a
way south to the assiniboine trails so dont
bother them an further than to see that
they keep moving lewis take jarvis and
the rest of the hurt men up to the
post

  you galt have spotted deer get ready
to take my despatch to james bay and then
get plenty of men to pry out that jam in the
chasm this place ought to drain by night
and well pick the fur packs and gear off the
dry bottom and you eugene look after
the canoes and salvage what you can
amid fresh joyful shrieks from their
squaws the hunters scrambled away on
their mission and lewis and galt set about
their respective tasks while carlisle waded
back to the boom with eugene

  since the struggle began he had had no
opportunity to even glance aside to where
he had left the others but now he saw them
in the same spot andrews bent over the
prostrate richelieu lying on the logs
wayne standing beside with his rifle-butt
grounded and joan beckoning with anxious
hands

  diable exclaimed eugene wat she
be want now wats wrong dere i aint
be see any wan
ambush



  its richelieu deduced carlisle he
must be badly hurt go on and attend to
the canoes eugene before they get
smashed up with floating ice

  he lunged ahead wheretodds canoe with
richelieus broken flagstaff in the bow lay
half-crushed against the boom and drew
himself up dripping on the logs

  whats the matter joan he asked
is he badly wounded

  andrews says hes going to die she told
him and he wants you hurry up
here paul begged andrews stand
over where he can see you

carlisle stepped over with joan
to where her father leaned on his
rifle by richelieus side the north-
wester lay in the groove between two of the
three rows of logs in the triple boom his
shoulders supported by andrews at first
glance carlisle noted where waynes bullet
had pierced his uniform high and to the left
of the middle of his breast

  there was little blood staining it above
but underneath the bark was red and his
breathing came in long irregular gasps
his black-bearded face was somber with an
unearthly somberness on account of the
pallor of the skin wherein the sunken pox-
pits showed a bluish tinge his eyelids lay
shut but at andrews whisper he opened
them and stared weakly up into carlisles
wondering face

  dieu he murmured his eyes turning
to andrews it is my last breath and it
is good that it goes into confession father
i have lived in sin that goes without say-
ing but i will not sink eternally into hell
oui and that is why i make confession
openly and to all

  he paused breathing heavily while his
eyes went back to carlisle to joan and
then to wayne

  it was i wayne he confessed with
electrifying unexpectedness that day
in the wyoming valley-that old day of
butlers raid mon dieu you knew i
loved her but you did not know how much
i was young i was a lieutenant i was
mad in the panic of the raid i thought to
make her ride away with me but she was

true ciel yes she was true and i-

  he stopped and wayne gazed at him as
a man of stone an inanimate thing that
can not comprehend then sudden as his
wrath the full import of richelieus words

flashed upon him and he changed from a
man of stone to a livid quivering demon
often as carlisle had seen him in anger he
had never seen anything like the light that
instantly fused his fawn-green eyes to incan-
descence

  it was as if all the fires of hell suddenly
struck them and were glanced back he
opened his mouth but not a word came
forth then with an animal-like snarl he
raised his rifle like a giant pestle in both
hands the butt poising over richelieus
head as if to stamp out some vermin or
reptile some monstrous abortion that he
had glimpsed in all its vileness

  carlisle and joan threw themselves upon
him from either hand carlisles grip locking
his arms to his side he raged like a fiend
but the factors great strength held him
back their bodies swaying from side to side
on the logs and as they swayed richelieu
began to speak again

  voila and then i lied i took you
wayne and told my story but named an-
other man i hated him oui you do not
know howl hated then in my youth i hated
charlie carlisle for i knew he loved her too
so i laid my wrong upon him because he
could not deny comment no he could
not deny wounded and drunk as he was
they were all drunk that day and he knew
not whether he fought man woman or child
one or one thousand of them

  my god breathed carlisle swift anger
overwhelming the vibrant thrill that riche-
lieus first words had sent pulsing through
him you did that

  he loosed his grip from wayne and oddly
enough the surge of wrath in carlisle left
wayne quiescent he was a man of stone
once more with one hand pressing on his
rifle barrel the other hand passed around
joans waist

  carlisle leaned over richelieu his face
contorted with mingled emotion righteous
indignation horror disgust suspense

  my god man-you did that he re-
peated

  oui and the head nodded feebly but
i knew his life would not be worth a franc
while wayne knew he was alive and i had
blood enough on my hands so i smuggled
him away till the heat of the day had died
out of him and then i told him what he
had done

  you incarnate fiend choked carlisle
for into hs mind rose the vision of his father


adventure

as he had known him-tall straight hand-
some the pride of his boyish eyes in the
dashing uniform of a captain of the rangers

  just so he knew he would not have
his life long if he stayed and who could
face his friends or his own flesh with that
stain upon him he disappeared and one
day a priest came into the post of niagara
to care for his boy

  who pray

  father andrews here

  carlisle leaned lower his face abruptly
charged with red blood

  and he lived-lives yet he demanded
why not i have lived-till now
wayne lives why not charlie carlisle
take my word for it if you dont take my
word for it ask father andrews here
charlie carlisle paid him to keep his se-
cret and to raise you and he knows but
be quick i am weakening fast and an-
drews must give me absolution

  andrews-andrews cried carlisle torn
with emotion my fathers alive
yes paul-yes

  you know where he is

  yes

  and youll take me to him now-i mean
soon without delay

  yes soon promised andrews when
we go down to grande portage ill take you
to him now go quickly dont you see
richelieus at his last breath

  andrews bent over richelieu to give him
final absolution and carlisle with his heart
in a tumult and his face alight turned away
to wayne and joan joans eyes were shin-
ing into his through a film of moisture but
wayne still stood like an image staring
stonily at the strange confessional then
he raised his eyes to carlisles and put out
his gnarled hand

  richelieu isnt the only one who wronged
you carlisle he exclaimed with a depth of
feeling that shook his chest ive put a
terrible wrong on you-on both you and
your father

  but wayne you can make it right
smiled carlisle clasping the gnarled fist
with one hand and significantly taking
joans soft palm with the other all in a
minute you can make it right

  wayne looked from one to the other and
an ancient tenderness a memory of van-
ished years seemed to creep into his stony
mahogany face his mask broke suddenly
and the tears ran down his cheeks

  by the doom carlisle he muttered
laying his hands upon their shoulders i
make it right

in the temple of the wild

 grande portage at last father
exclaimed joan using words she had
used a full year before as the factors craft
grazed the port charlotte landing on the
pigeon rivers bank it is good to get
the canoe cramps out

 yes joan nodded wayne a smile
cracking the grim mahogany of his face as
recollection stirred within him its been
a long day but theres a nine-mile walk to
stretch your legs

  and not a packer to clutter up the trail
laughed carlisle giving joan his hand to
help her out look at port charlotte-
empty as a last years birds nest look
at the portage-deserted to the skyline i
well have a quick passage over

 twelve months ago he had gone into
cumberland house with a lone canoe now

hundred paddles as he turned off up the
trail with joan followed by wayne and
andrews he waved a sign to his brigade
leader drummond to unload the massed
brigades and pack over after him

  side by side in the warm glow of the july
evening he and joan climbed up over the
three miles of gentle convolutions that
terraced the way to the loftiest ridge before
they looked back and when they glanced
around they beheld an unbroken line of
pack-laden men crawling upward with the
slow peculiar bobbing motion that packs
in the tump-line impart

  the sight brought home more clearly to
joan the memory of that other evening when
carlisle and andrews had come over the
portage with their warning and she began
to laugh softly in low throaty notes that
blended with songs of the thrushes by the
trailside

  do you remember paul how you came
to tell us the portage was closed you were
a northwest mail courier in black cotton
shirt mackinaw trousers cowhide mocca-
sins and a battered blue felt hat yes and
ambush



your face was stained as brown as an in-
dians do you remember

  yes nodded carlisle i remember that
masquerade all right and i remember how
i cursed it when you came

  why she teased because it was so
dirty

  no you cherished hypocrite because i
wanted you to know me as i was i wanted
to stand in the skin god gave me
conceited thing joan bantered as
if that amounted to much and as if i
cared at all

  she fluted out her laughter freely as she
darted down the grande portage slope of
the trail away from the reach of his im-
pulsive arm graceful as a fawn she ran
breaking into song in the sheer joy of her
surroundings and inner being and carlisle
his heart singing too in anticipation of the
union and the reunion that was to be sprang
lightly after

  they swish-swished in their moccasins
across the corduroy paths of the beaver
meadows over the small bridged creeks
down the hundred-foot gulches that dropped
like steps toward lake superior through
the patches of poplar and birch and the
heart of the grand pinery they descended
now slowly to a walk now quickening to a
run till they traversed the last mile of the
long slope and came out into the clearing
close to the northwest post

  as at port charlotte and along the whole
length of the portage there was not a man
to be seen yet men had been here not
long before for in the canoe harbor the re-
covered fur sloop otter and many big rab-
iscaw canoes from montreal were tied and
upon the curving sand beach burned the
evening fires of the canoemen

  breathing themselves while they waited
for the others carlisle and joan stared at
the scene before them with the sympathetic
eyes of children blooded to the wild afar
surged the vast green expanse of lake su-
perior gilded with the molten wash of gold
spilled over the high wooded mainland
ridge where the pigeon river brawled down
to its rest on the mighty bosom scrolled
with its white-crested waves

  nearer at hand spread the channel a
mile and one-quarter wide screened by the
tree-crowned island that almost yielded to
the primeval embrace of the mainland
as they had seen it a year ago so they saw
it now the sheltering island with its rubble

of great gnarled boulders littering the
beach its long sloping point sheering up and
its rampart of bush standing solid above

  their eyes followed the amphitheater of
the bay a crescent sweep of shallow water
delicate green in color and clear as air edged
by a low flat shore that was backed in turn
by terraced laurentian hills

  tier upon tier the hills rose as of old the
lowest three hundred feet in height the
highest over one thousand covered with
crowding forest of birch and spruce and
pine thrusting out virgin arms to embrace
the lesser island yonder was the natural
barrier the forty-foot cliff of rock walling
the back of the level shore land and curving
westward into the lake not a tree or a
stone was changed or gone

  along the eastern side foamed the small
stream in unvaried volume and there with-
out addition or diminution the post build-
ings crouched behind their eighteen-foot
cedar palings with the gate fast closed
while the same tent villages and teepees and
cabins dotted the eastern bank of the stream
with the same cattle grazing on the meadows
and terraces farther back

  in the midst of their silent gazing they
heard the feet of wayne and andrews and
the packers behind and with one accord
they moved on along the path that led to
the closed gate of the post

eighteen feet in the air thomp-
sons quizzical welsh face peered
down at them over the top of the
palisades

  by st john carlisle he greeted
art here then had word of ee hast
come in peace or in war

  in peace dawy old friend laughed
carlisle theres no need to trouble you
open the gate

  ha is good news grinned dawy
wouldst not want tuh slaying of all with
my own hands am all alone here
joan carlisle and the rest burst into
hearty laughter as thompsons head dis-
appeared from the palisades to reappear a
moment later in the open entrance

  that was a bold front you put on for a
solitary man dawy chaffed carlisle
shaking his hand prodigiously i won-
dered why port charlotte and the portage
were deserted

  word of thy doings came down tuh
waterways thompson explained and


adventure

not a man wouldst stay the eastern
partners wouldst not come past tuh kam-
inistiquia and tuh indians and tuh mon-
treal paddlers here took to tuh bush

  they dont need to be alarmed car-
lisle assured him all we want is a peaceful
passage you see dawy the hudsons
bay company has smashed the north-
westers to pieces in the hinterland and the
absorption of the pieces will not be long
delayed amalgamation is coming old
friend and you yourself will be back with
us again

  by st john dost say so old roamer

of colen hast loved thee like a brother
carlisle and wilt go with a good heart if tuh
hudsons bay takes tuh northwest com-
pany over wilt be no trade this summer
anyway so wast thinking of going west to
hew a new pass over tuh rockies

  then youll hew it for the hudsons bay
company in the end dawy

  thompson shrugged his shoulders
what matter carlisle tuh land is big-
ger than any institution is greater than its
furs wilt be an empire in tuh end of all
and thou art going to james bay
yes davyy

  art stopping tuh night here

  no well travel the lake when the breeze
dies down tomorrow we may have to lie
up wind-bound on the shore will you give
miss wayne and father andrews the use of
your post for a few minutes she wants to
put on another dress and andrews a new
cassock

  wilt give me pleasure agreed thomp-
son saluting joan and the others gravely
but what is tuh purpose

  dawy smiled carlisle the last time
i was here as a mail courier i had a hand in
saving a certain young lady from being
carried off against her will now shes
being carried off with her own consent
thompsons eyes opened wide his face
creased in a grin of remembrance and com-
prehension and he suddenly extended his
hand to the girl

  ha is that then wilt congratulate
you miss wayne yon dirty courier is lucky
man art most beautiful woman hast ever
seen come in wilt give ee my own house
for tuh purpose you and tuh priest

  he led joan and andrews inside while
carlisle and wayne passed on to the beach
where the first packers were letting down

the canoes and fur bales and more and more
were arriving every minute in the gathering
dusk and slipping their tump-lines to the
ground

  carlisle knew such a freight of fur
throughout the whole history of the fur
trade had never come over the grande por-
tage in a single season not only the vast
catch of the hudsons bay company was in
transit but also the large take of the north-
west company which he had captured from
richelieu the mckenzies todd mcleod
mcdougall mcgillivray and sager in the
devils elbow

  their yearly turnover greater than any
other turnover known in america had
turned to his hands and it would continue
to so turn vast as had been the institution
of the northwesters it was like the trust of
the free-traders shaken to its foundations
by a combination of organized warfare and
divine visitation

  the montreal brigades of rivermen were
here slinking in the woods but this year
the northmen from the pays den haut
would not gather to meet them

grande portage was an open
road not a private gateway to the
west and though it would be used
for some time by his company as an entre-
pot for inland business and as an outlet on
superior carlisle saw in his minds eye a
changing of the routes by which the fur
would all flow to hudsons bay instead of to
montreal

  he pictured the dwindling of the grande
portage the spot where the brains of the
northwest company had been situated
though its nominal headquarters pulsed in
beaver hall the spot from which the ruth-
less power of the organization was distrib-
uted in stupendous ramifications like
electric energy from a distant waterfall
and in the end he saw the post dismantled
its foundations buried in the sand and scrub
the portage unused the western highway
forgotten

  something of the same thought was run-
ning through waynes mind as he watched
the packing down and the relaunching
and reloading of the canoes and carlisle
turning to speak to him caught it in
his eye

  you see it too wayne he ventured
you see the glory departing from this
place
ambush



  yes its sure to go down now proph-
esied wayne his eyes fixed seer-like and
the first wagon-road linking up the east and
the west will carve its epitaph
sometimes i see a road of my own
carlisle confided from the pays den haut
to hudsons bay yes and sometimes i
even see the shoals of the bay gouged out
and a regular fleet of ships sailing there
its going to be as thompson says a coun-
try bigger than any individual bigger than
any institution an empire in the end
furthermore its going to be an empire no
man can be ashamed of wayne why not
have a hand in its making

  wayne shook his head disconsolately
no im going back when we reach
michipicoten back to the wyoming valley
it was unrest drove me out carlisle its
rest content thats taking me home
but youll come sometimes come to see
her

 every year in the spring-when the
wanderlust stirs during the months i
wont see her i tell you ill be very lonely
carlisle but dont let her know that
never a word look out-here she comes
she was coming out of the post with
thompson and andrews and time was sud-
denly telescoped for carlisle he beheld
her as he had first beheld her that evening
she had stepped out of her fathers canoe at
port charlotte and as he gazed at her he
had the mystic feeling that this was that
very moment there had been no long
hard danger-ridden months no bitter blood
feud no deadly rivalry between

  here glided her swelling-hipped full-
bosomed figure erect agile supple in poise
with the graceful strength in the curves of
the limbs as it had first glided into his con-
sciousness here shimmered her radiant
hair yellow wheaten spun-gold all in one
like the mingling hues of the birchen leaves
in autumn framing the laughing-eyed
crimson-sprayed red-lipped face

  only she wore the clinging champagne-
colored dress of silk that she had worn at
andrews first open-air service on the shores
of pine island lake the snow-white doe-
skin half-moccasins peeping from under-
neath the single jewel at her throat

  carlisle caught his breath deeply as he
walked out with wayne upon the shoreway
of the canoe pier his ermine canoe-robe
over his shoulder on the eastern or harbor
arm of the cribwork that extended but

halfway back to land he spread the robe for
joans feet and stood upon it with her
wayne at their side andrews in front

  in the crystal-clear water of the canoe
harbor at their feet floated his huge six-
fathom craft with the hudsons bay com-
panys crimson flag in the bow his own
streaming gonfalon in the stern his tried
crew were poised in their places waseyawin
in the bow missowa in the stern the two
middlemen paired forward the two others
paired aft their paddle shafts decorated
with the gaudy woolen streamers their
bright-beaded moccasins gay leggins flam-
ing belts and scarfs flashing many hues
their black-haired fillet-bound heads car-
tying the long graceful slanting violent-
colored plumes that proclaimed them fac-
tors canoemen

  close beside nosed the canoes of the
officers galt drummond lewis garry
lea jarvis hampton wells while behind
them the massed brigades covered the
entire canoe harbor the blood-red stars
burning upon their warm-yellow bows like
the fires upon the beach

  alone by the fires stood thompson sole
guest of the northwest company till pres-
ently the montreal brigades lurking in the
woods on either hand took heart to emerge
they had marked the hudsons bay fleet
all afloat marked how things were shaping
on the pier and crept out three hundred and
fifty of them to gather silently round on
the sandy flat-the giant pork eaters
french voyageurs off the ottawa river
and the parishes around iroquois indians
caughnawaga indians the famed rivermen
of the rabiscaws

a tamed voiceless host they
gathered for this season their car-
nival among the northmen would
not ring their carousal would not rage with
their songs and their boissons and their dev-
iltry and for them the code of the law was
written farther than the sault

  they stared in wonder while the same
priest they had seen in grande portage the
year before raised his voice from the rude
altar of the canoe pier in the spruce-walled
starry-naved temple of the wild

  on the winds of the wilderness and to
you dwellers in the wilderness he de-
claimed i publish the banns

  sonorously andrews voice sounded as
he went on to complete the ceremony and


adventure

even as he finished the shade of bertand
the montreal mail courier seemed to rise
from the depths of grande portage bay

  there came the snoring surge of waters
swiftly cloven a triumphant yell out of the
lakeward dark the thump of a quickly-
wielded paddle upon a canoe gunwale and
the next instant a lone birchbark craft tore
through the water-gate of the pier and
spilled its lone occupant on the cribwork at
their feet

  spotted deer exclaimed carlisle rec-
ognizing the cree dispatch-bearer he had
sent down to james bay by the hayes with
the report of victory for the governor

  ae replied spotted deer with the
sun and the stars i have paddled to meet
you here

  he held out a dispatch that bore the
governors seal

  hastily carlisle broke it open and glanced
it over in the red flare that the camp-fires
sent across the water his hand shook a
little as he passed it on to andrews

  read it out andrews he begged it
concerns them all as well as me

  andrews read aloud

  i was overjoyed to get the news of the north-
westers defeat its consequences will be far-reach-
ing indeed it means no less than the conserving
of our charter till such time as we see fit to surrender
it it means the founding of a western empire
which we shall pioneer

  words can not express my delight and my satis-
faction at the trust i had in you and i want to
record that trust in a more material way as i
wrote you the james bay climate has been hard on
me the doctor here at york factory says i have
no option but to leave

  so i must sail on the london fur vessel this
summer i shall earn- my resignation with me and
you i have appointed temporary governor in my
stead till i reach england and have the london
committee ratify the appointment any appoint-
ments you- may think due those under you i shall
also slate accordingly as one of my last acts before
giving up the governorship

  spotted deer speaks of a rumor that runs hinting
of another honor you will win my sincerest con-
gratulations and the hope to see you both soon i
am arranging a grand reception for you when you
reach james bay

  paul-paul breathed joan tensely
while carlisle his eyes shining into hers
mutely pressed her hands

  you dwellers in the wilderness i intro-
duce governor carlisle and his wife an-
nounced andrews handing the dispatch
back and stepping aside

  from the massed brigades a vociferous
cheer thundered out and simultaneously
the fifteen hundred paddles poised in per-
pendicular salute the crimson firelight
flashing from the blades

  carlisle acknowledged the salute with
upraised hand and began to speak in res-
onant tones fraught with deep emotion

  men of the hudsons bay i take the
governor at his word you have earned
more than any men may get in this world
but this much at least may be yours to
galt lewis lea garry hampton jarvis
and wells i give the permanent factorships
of cumberland house the pas the nep-
owin moose lake chimawawin grand
rapids and the carrot river

  waseyawin missowa and their middle-
men are no longer factors crew they are
governors crew and to the middlemen i
add smoking pine and spotted deer
and you drummond i make chief brigade
leader of all the hudsons bay companys
brigades

  a second time the vociferous cheer thun-
dered out the generous-hearted tribute of
the brigade men to these honored officers
and the officers in grim pride acknowledged
the tribute-all but eugene drummond

  his diable mystery was dissolving at last
and unthinking of his high appointment
his volatile face worked his milk-white teeth
gleamed his thin nostrils quivered his coal-
black eyes danced as he stared at andrews
on the pier loosing the cord to drop his
brand-new cassock and pull away the mos-
quito veil

  mon dieu cried eugene gesticulating
with outstretched finger and streaming his
raven hair this way and that with nervous
head jerks mon dieu-look there

  carlisle joan and wayne wheeled swiftly
but andrews was not there

  by the discarded cassock and mosquito
veil stood a tall straight handsome gray-
haired grave-faced stranger in the ancient
but dashing uniform of butlers rangers

lisle identified wayne

author of the fluent adventurer the sleuth etc

iewed from the sea the head-
quarters of mr commissioner
sanders was a strip of golden sand
fringed to the seaward side by a
green backing of trees you caught a
glimpse of the white residency with its
red roof and on a very clear day the little
flagstaff where the national standard hung
limply perhaps you might even see the
long rows of yellow barrack huts where the
housas lived but you saw little more

  officers of passing steamers which came
sufficiently near the west african coast
would point out the mouth of the river and
show the passengers how the yellow waters
ran far out cutting a muddy roadway into
the indigo-blue of the sea and sometimes
a mail steamer would slow down and drop
into a waiting surf-boat a small mail-bag

  but the territories and the three white
men who ruled them had no personality
to the ocean-going wanderers until a certain
day when a beneficent government placed
in the hands of the commissioner a means
by which he and his fellows might become
at least articulate

  lieutenant tibbetts coming to breakfast
one fiery morning discovered a folded sheet
of foolscap paper beneath his plate

  ha monday sir said he with an
extravagant start as though the discovery

that this was indeed the second day of the
week came in the nature of a shock and
orders of the week as per regulations

  read em you lazy do-fellow said
hamilton catching his sisters reproving
eye

  quite unnecessary my jolly old tyrant
said bones airily as he shook his serviette
free with a loud lap and all but caught
mr commissioner sanders coffee-cup
quite superfluous-i know em by heart

  i the orderly officer of the week is
poor old bones who will do everything
every day

    field trainin will be carried out on
tuesday wednesday friday an saturday
under the command of poor old bones

    kit inspection on thursday bones
will arrange

 by order 

  read it suggested hamilton

  with a hoist of his shoulders bones
opened the paper and read

   orderly officer for the week lt tib-
betts-what did i say field trainin in
accordance with paragraph-um-um-lt
tibbetts-as expected-hullo dear old
sir-whats this

    on the erection of the new flagstaff
and signal yard lt tibbetts will assume


o

adventure

the duties of  c signals he will be
responsible for the maintenance in good
condition of the signal locker and flags

code books- 

  they are sending the pole down from

h	q administration explained hamil-
ton and it should be up by the end of
the week-do you know anything about
signals bones

  bones smiled

  i think i may say in all modesty dear
old sir he said with fine carelessness
that theres jolly little i dont know about
signals i hate to boast dear old ham

as youve often said-

  ive never said anything so untruthful-
but i should not let that discourage you
interrupted hamilton nor should it divert
your mind from the fact that i asked you
a very simple question to which you have
not yet replied do you understand sig-
nals

  i wont deceive you said bones
solemnly i do

and this he proved for when the
great new flagstaff had been erected
and the government tug which had
towed the pole to the beach had turned
its nose for home bones with the aid of
the government code-book signalled-
wish you pleasant voyage

  whereupon the tug spun round and came
back at full speed

  the signal flags hlmi sir said
the exasperated skipper of the tug do not
mean wish you pleasant voyage but
return at once natives are in revolt 
dear me said bones how jolly
romantic

  and so the tug went off again and bones
undeterred sent a string of flags fluttering
up to the yard which the skipper read-
am short of coal-can you tow me
which he rightly interpreted as being some-
thing rather complimentary in farewell
messages

  bones not only took kindly to his new
job but it became for him an absorbing
passion not only did he spend his spare
hours poring over the government and
mercantile codes but he invented a code of
his own

  not only had he signal flags but in a
great box each enclosed in a neat canvas
bag were the ensigns of the nations for
employment-said the printed instruc-

tions-in saluting war vessels governors
commissioners etc of foreign powers
some of em wholly superfluous dear
old sir he complained unless we receive
a visit from the swiss fleet or hobnob with
the jolly old king of siam-an who the
dooce am i to salute with the german
royal standard with a war like this
going on it cant be done dear old thing
life had a new interest not only for
himself but for every native within ten
miles of the station visitors and residents
alike would gather about the flagstaff and
watch bones as he played with his new toy
and one of these visitors was the son of
the sister of a certain buluta and a no-
torious thief

  of this small fact bones was oblivious
in the ecstasy of new discoveries for he
found friends which in olden days moved
outside of his orbit he sent astounding
greetings to little old tramps that came
rolling over the edge of the ocean spoke
hilariously to passing liners which answered
briefly and often coldly-the affirmative
in answer to a sixteen-flag message was little
short of a snub-and once when a lean gray
american warship came nosing out of
nowhere looking for submarines bones
surpassed himself in a cordial greeting
which ran literally

d yd has arrived at this port

s

y

l

x have cavalry chargers on board

a

b

t

s am carrying feathers and hats

y

r

u

g please arrange supply wine and macaroni
m for italian emigrants

  the commander of the american warship
fortunately thought that there was a re-
gatta or a fourth of july celebration on
shore and contented himself with signaling
-good-by

  and what the dickens were you trying
to say asked hamilton when bones com-
plained bitterly of the lack of international
courtesy

  my dear but dull old landlubber said
the fetish stick



bones wearily its as plain as your jolly
old nose if sanders were here hed under-
stand it in a minute ive studied the
dashed thing an worked it out

 but what does it mean insisted
hamilton

  bones uttered impatient sounds

  its a verse he said shortly that jolly
little tune

        yankee doodle came to town
          riding on a pony
          he stuck a feather-

  if youre going to laugh said bones
huffily theres nothin more to be said
sir and he closed the book with a bang

  bones was frankly bad-tempered that
morning for in addition to other vexations
he had discovered the loss of a certain
national ensign which had disappeared
from under his eyes

about this time in the forest
village of kasanga a man fell sick
he had pains in his head shoot-
ing throbbing stabs of agony that did not
cease by day or night

  he was lucky in that there lived in this
village a very famous witch-doctor one
buluta to whom all the forest folk went
in their hour of adversity his fame
passed the frontiers of his own land and
you might not travel for a day anywhere
in the river territories without coming upon
a man or woman who wore on his or her
breast one of those charms which were
characteristic of buluta

  if you take a palm-kernel soak it in a
solution of gum and camwood thread it
neatly with two steel wires and turn the
free ends of the wires until each forms the
letter p you have a fair imitation of
that powerful spellmaker which cured
coughs and insured for married men the
fidelity of their wives

  the sick would pay him a chicken for
his services and this gift was tied to one
of the legs of the sufferer and buluta
kneeling by the patients side would knead
and pound the unfortunate body of his
victim starting from the head and working
down to the feet until the evil spirit which
possessed the patient and which caused his
unhappiness would depart with a loud
cry-which buluta himself supplied-into
the body of the bird whereupon he would
cut off the head of the bird sprinkle a few

drops of his blood upon the gratified patient
who by this time should have felt such
relief as would enable him to rise and call
his doctor blessed

  and in most cases this relief was in-
stantaneous and complete sometimes
buluta would find no response to his treat-
ment but that was invariably explained
to his own credit by the discovery of be-
witchment or a peculiarly strong devil
whom the sick man had offended

  in such cases as these buluta would go
into the forest for a consideration and
conduct an expensive wrestling match with
the devil usually by the time he re-
turned to the village to discover what had
happened to the patient-the patient
had died

  now this man who laid so grievously
sick was rich and buluta had long envied
him his wealth so that when he was sum-
moned by the mans principal wife he saw
the magnificence of the opportunity

  he had the patient stripped and laid
upon a wooden grille and beneath him he
lit a fire of herbs that sent up a very thick
and pungent smoke

  he also painted all the toes of the sick
man with red camwood that the devils
might not enter his body then he cut
little patterns in the chest of kofubu-
that was the mans name-with a small
keen knife what other treatment he
would have introduced may only be sur-
mised

  since it was acknowledged that none was
greater than buluta and that if he could
not cure kofubu no other witch-doctor
could perform that service for him the
philosophical villagers decided that he
must be left to die and death would cer-
tainly have been his fate but for the happy
circumstance that mr commissioner san-
ders was making a tour through the forest
villages and arrived one evening when the
seven wives of kofubu were discussing the
division of his property

  sanders carried a hairy little medicine-
chest which contained a few but powerful
drugs designed to meet the half-a-dozen
epidemic or simple maladies native to the
country if the disease was outside the
range of the six diseases for which he had
made provision the sick man or woman was
treated for the commonplace ailment
which it most nearly resembled

  sanders went into the hut of the man


adventure

and found two strands of wire tightly-
bound about his skull these strands having
been in place for some twelve years they
were rather difficult to cut and kofubu
suffered something in the process but
when they were removed and after the man
had spent a night under the influence of
one of sanders six medicants he dis-
covered that his pain had disappeared

  i think you are a fool kofubu said
sanders for who but a fool would put wire
about his head

  lord said kofubu ruefully that
was a very powerful charm which kept
from me ghosts and evil devils

  you were nearer to ghosts and evil
devils than you know my man said
sanders with a wry smile he had no use
for witch-doctors of any kind

  sanders sent for the medicine-man

  buluta said he do you believe in
devils

  lord i do replied the man appre-
hensively eying the stick which sanders
carried

  and do you believe that your devils will
save you pain

  the man still with his eye on the stick
edged away

  answer said sanders sharply

  lord it is said that we wise men do
not feel-ouch

  and now said sanders when the
flogging was finished hear my words i
will have no witch-doctor who draws blood
in this land this time i beat but if i send
for you because you have done this evil
again i will await you at the village of
irons and there you shall stay for ten
years

  the commissioner passed on the next day
and buluta was forgotten but buluta did
not forget

it was a month or five weeks
after sanders had come and gone
that buluta sent secret messengers
to all the tribes to the ngombi the inner
ngombi to the akasava the lesser
akasava and the three-streams akasava
to the isisi the lesser isisi to the ochori
and the upper ochori and even into the
forbidden land of the old king

  to no chiefs or headmen did his summons
go but to strange old men who lived apart
from the communities to which they were
attached and on the night his call reached

them they left their villages furtively and
came by hidden ways to the rendezvous
which buluta had appointed this was
one of those famous islands where bats
hang in great bunches from the trees
throughout the hot day and fly by the
thousand over the river at night there
never was such an assembly in all the
history of the land since the day when
they buried gufufu the witch-doctor

  there were old men and there were young
men too men fantastically arrayed in
skins of unknown animals men belted
about with teeth and claws men cloaked
in feathers men streaked and circled with
paint and they came to sit at the feet of
buluta and learn his will

  wise goats said buluta i have called
you that i may tell of wonders for i who
understand devils and have fought with
terrible ghosts have been beaten by sandi
because he hates me also i have dis-
covered a great wonder all men know
that sandi has a ju-ju which tells him when
any man breaks the law-for have not the
people of the river held very private
palavers and has not sandi come swiftly
and when the akasava went secretly to
make war and none knew save the king
where the goats would bleed was not sandi
waiting in the isisi river for their coming
wa chorused his audience all men
know this

  bulutas eyes blazed

  now i have found the mystery he
shouted in triumph sandi has a wonderful
fetish

  that is foolish talk said a skeptic in
the circle for all people know that sandi
is a white man and white men have no
fetishes

  wa that is true said another for
did not sandi beat me cruelly because i
smelt out one who had bewitched the
daughter of kumulubu the chief of the
lesser isisi

  let all men hear this cried buluta
sandi who lives in a fine house by the sea
has put up a great stick near where the big
water runs and that is his fetish for the son
of my sister who has newly come from
sandis home tells me this and every morn-
ing tibbetti the young one goes before this
stick and bows himself and picks up pieces
of cloth and hangs it upon the stick and
puts his hand to his face thus

  one of the old witch-doctors nodded
the fetish stick



  i also have seen bonsei put his hand to
his face when he speaks to my lord sandi
and to militini and a soldier of sandis
told me that he does jhis thing to do honor
to militini and to sandi who are his chiefs
now tell us buluta what may we
do

  buluta raised his hands he was almost
incoherent in his excitement

 we will make a dance and a devil
palaver such a palaver as never was seen
in this land and we ourselves will put up a
great stick so that we may talk with ghosts
for the son of my sister has stolen a won-
derful cloth such as tibbetti hangs and
this is sutely a great magic and a charm
for sickness and since we shall be as
great as sandi he shall not harm us if
through our medicine men die also be-
cause he beat me i will lay a spell upon
him and he will go mad wa

 for six days there were mysterious
doings on the island of bats fifty separate
fires burned and smoked and the awe-
stricken villagers on the mainland watched
this evidence of the witch-doctors activity
with their knuckles to their teeth there
was sacrificing of goats and chickens and
a score of snakes died in the course of
twenty different rituals there was a
pounding and a mixing a dancing and a
chanting beyond all precedent and when
a week and three days had gone by buluta
and five delegates launched their canoe
and struck down the river to the forest
of tall trees to choose the stick and
annoint their find with proper ceremony

      news of a gathering of witch-
jtfgprjj doctors reached sanders and the

      commissioner acted quickly bones
was torn from his tangled halyards and his
chaotic signal locker and dispatched he
protesting in search of proofs

  near the forest of happy dreams the
river broadens until it forms a great lake
where on hazy days it is almost impossible
to see from shore to shore steersmen
loathe this breadth of water because sand-
banks grow in a night and islands that you
chart on your way up give way to five
fathoms of water on your way down-stream
there are places in this lake where a
steamer can bump her way into deep
water and find herself within a sandy circle
from whence there is no escape on such
occasions all the crew descend into the water

                                 t

and literally lift the steamer from her em-
barrassing position

  on a hot day in july a little steamer
specklessly white her tall twin funnels
belching a constant billow of black smoke
picked an erratic way through the lake
two sounding boys sat in her bows and
stabbed the water at intervals of a few
seconds with long rods transmitting the
depth in tones of abysmal weariness

  bones standing on the bridge of the
zaire with a telescope under his arm and a
very severe and disapproving frown upon
his forehead watched the maneuver of the
government ship with every indication of
impatience

  oh yoka he said at last turning to
the steersman is there no straight course
for when i brought the zaire through this
broad river i turned neither to the left nor
to the right

  lord said the kano boy who steered
not taking his eyes from the waters ahead
who knows this river-every day the
water finds a new way

  bones turned to a weary tut and his
thoughts went back longingly to a cool
beach and a high white flagstaff

  presently he spoke again in arabic
now my great eyes can see the course
he said you shall go to the middle
waters

  master said yoka earnestly i think
there is sand in the middle waters

  it is an order said the imperious
bones

  the wheel spun round under the helms-
mans hand and the nose of the zaire
pushed round they struck the strong
river current the black waters piled
themselves up before the bows

  exactly said bones complacently i
thought we should do it

  suddenly the speed of the vessel per-
ceptibly stopped and yoka who knew that
this meant that she was reaching shallow
water spun the wheel with feverish haste
there was a shivering bump another and a
whole series of frantic little hops and
though the stern-wheel thrashed furiously
the zaire went neither forward nor back-
ward

  master said yoka simply this is a
sandbank

  bones said nothing he took his big
pipe from his pocket deliberately loaded
it with tobacco struck a match and lit it


adventure

and puffed cloudily he was apparently
deep in thought then at last he spoke

  we shall have to get her off he
said

  unfortunately the zaire on this trip was
carrying a skeleton crew there were a
dozen housas a few deck hands a native
engineer also half a dozen villagers who
had begged a passage to youkombi

  moreover part of the zaire lay in deep
water so that it was impossible to wade
bones rang the engines first to stop and
then to astern but the zaire was firmly
fixed

  but presently the river will rise he
said to yoka confidently and the water
will wash away the sand

  yoka scratched his chin

  i think the waters are going down
lord he said for the river was in flood
six days ago and there have been no
rains

  you are a silly old ass said the an-
noyed bones

  he scanned the horizon for a sign of a
village though he might have known that
there was none for he had passed through
the lake fifty times bones motto how-
ever was that you never know and such
was his optimistic spirit that he at any rate
would not have been surprised to have dis-
covered a fairly large-sized township
equipped with amongst other things a
complete dredging plant had established
itself since his last visit

  there was only one thing to do bones
ordered the canoe to be launched and with
four paddlers and one housa as an escort
he made his way to the nearest village
which as it happened was situated on the
big middle island that lay athwart the
northern end of the lake there was as
he knew a footpath close to the river and
he started off on his two-mile tramp to
youkombi the village in question

  a mile from the point of his departure
the path divided for here the land forms a
promontory one path naturally followed
the water but the other cut straight across
the neck of the salient and formed a short
way for such people as did not fear ghosts
bones took the nearer path and in conse-
quence he did not see the two watchers who
squatted by the side of the water only
waiting for a glimpse of the zaire to fly
back with their discovery to youkombi

  it also happened that when he reached the

point where the paths were reunited in-
stead of following the one broad track that
leads to the village he followed the forest
path which took him away to the left for
he was anxious to see for himself whether
certain allegations against the people of
the youkombi were well founded though
he was not conscious of the fact here he
missed the second group of watchers who
as a matter of precaution had been placed
on the road half a mile from the village

  bones searched diligently and patiently
for in all matters of strict and serious duty
bones was conscientious to a fault his
search was well rewarded for under a
dwarf mimosa and almost hidden by the
rank foliage which smothered the ground
he discovered a bundle wrapped in native
cloth and containing certain little wooden
pots of native manufacture which were filled
with van-colored clay there was red and
green and vivid orange blue and brown
also there was a necklace of human teeth
a mask of feathers and a strange-looking
ivory instrument shaped rather like a
tuning-fork

bones met no villager and it was
extremely unlikely that he would
because the whole of youkombi was
sitting in wrapt silence watching a man
fantastically hued with great white rings
painted round his eyes and blue and green
stripes of ocher running across his shrunken
breast they would have been interested
in buluta under any circumstances for his
name was a household word from the terri-
tory of the great king to the villages by
the sea but what added fascination to his
own personality was the fact that he was
at that moment engaged under the pro-
fessional inspection of fifty witch-doctors
in curing the first wife of the headman of
the youkombi

  the cure was a simple business she
lay spread-eagled on the ground ankles
and wrists attached by stout rawhide thongs
to little sticks which had been driven in the
ground and he was letting out the nine and
nine devils with which she was possessed
from time to time lecturing as an ana-
tomical professor to his fascinated audience

  oh people and wise ones thus you see
my magic he said brandishing his little
knife and rubbing his nose with the back
of his lean hand because of the wonderful
things i do now sandi would hate me and
the fetish stick



follow me with guns but now because of
a great magic which i have done i am
greater than sandi and i may do many
things which were forbidden i cut this
woman a little-so what do you see wise
brothers and people of the youkombi
just a little blood do you see the little
devils with eyes like moons only buluta
sees those look there he goes

  his bony finger pointed and traced the
passage of the mythical devil and as it
indicated a progress nearer and nearer to
the circle those who stood in its line leaped
out and sprang shivering back to allow it
passage

  there it goes he croaked into the
forest i see it it is gone presently it
will come back a very beautiful wonder
none will see it but i

  he bent his head as though listening his
hand to his ear

  my ju-ju tells me it is coming look
look he pointed again to the forest it
comes

  an appropriate moment this for bones to
make his appearance which he did quite
unknowing that he fitted so well into the
scheme of clairvoyance the people stood
dumfounded their knuckles to their
mouths

  this is a great wonder said the head-
man of youkombi for this good devil
looks like tibbetti

  but the witch-doctor did not reply
this was a moment too great for words
as for his fifty hideous colleagues they
faded into the shadow of the woods

  bones marched into the circle his helmet
pulled rakishly over one eye an eye-glass
in the other and stood looking down at the
medicine-man and his victim he dropped

his cane lightly on the shoulder of the
headman

  take this woman away kabala he
said afterward you shall call a palaver
of your people

  he turned his attention to the witch-
doctor

  oh buluta he said sandi wants
you

  the witch-doctor licked his lips before
him was the supreme injustice of a ten
years sentence-and that it was unjust
he stoutly believed

he looked round helplessly and then-
lord he cried his eyes bright with
hope by my magic and my ju-ju you may
not touch me for i am favored by a fetish
stick greater than sandis-look

  bones eyes followed the pointed finger
for the first time he saw the tall roughly
dressed flagstaff

  good gracious heaven an earth
gasped bones

  lord buluta went on proudly that
is a great devil more terrible than mshimba-
mshimba very fierce and terrifying who
eats up people and i call this thing ewa
which is death

   bones shaded his eyes and looked steadily
upward at the one standard that floated
at the head of the staff

  he saw the big black cross on the white
ground and the double-headed eagle with
its clutching talons and nodded

  ewa which is called death he repeated
soberly i think you are wiser than you
know buluta

  his automatic pistol cracked three times
and at the third shot the rope that held the
german imperial standard aloft was
severed and the flag came fluttering down
upside don or backwards

 w c txittle

 author of marys little lamb with the joker wild etc

she aint changed an awful
ice i left remarks magpie
kins as he cuddles his long
up under his chin and tilts
his chair against the side of the cabin

  you cant expect no big changes in uh
wilderness like this in thirty days says i
and he nods emphatic like and spits at uh
lizard

  the east looks good ike he pro-
claims

  did the east look good to you or did
you look good to the east i asks seems
to me that you gets uh heap civilized in
thirty days whats the idea uh that
hard hat

  last word in head-gear ike he states
picking the yaller pot-shaped thing off the
ground and patting it affectionate like
they calls em darby hats did yuh
notice that green and red shirt in my
valise i annexes that in chicago 
u s a and she sure is uh humdinger
got uh necktie pin in that valise too that
only assessed me ten dollars and eighty-five
cents and nobody what never seen uh real
diamond could tell the difference

  being as ignorance is bliss around here
yuh may make uh hit magpie i replies
the fact that yuh hangs your person full
uh christmas tree ornaments dont lessen
my hankering to hear yuh tell about how

  much capital yuh got interested in the
  silver threads

    magpie simpkins is ike harpers pardner
  and im ike harper we owns the silver
  threads mine four burros uh little grub
  and uh desire to find somebody with money
  to promote us

    magpies physique is impressing unless
  yuh views him edgeways when yuh cant
  get more  n uh glimpse hes six feet
  several inches tall wears uh kind look and
  uh long mustache and has the ability to let
  me into more trouble than man is heir to

   when we gets nine hundred dollars
 worth uh gold out of our placer mine on
 plenty stone crick magpie gets the pro-
 moting itch he orates that in the east
 is uh tribe uh philanthropists who spend
 their time hunting for uh shaft to sink their
 money in

    also he opines that as uh hunter and
  finder uh this certain person he cant be
  beat or even tied i protests audibly and
  often that we ought to let gold enough
  alone but when magpie gets an idea like
  that its all off until hes proved that my
  objections were well founded

    therefore and immediate he packs his
  valise-or rather one he borrows from
  buck masterson the saloon-keeper at
  piperock and pilgrims east

    i holds down uh chair on the shady side

upside down or backwards



of our cabin for thirty days and tries to
figure out how long it will take em to get
magpies nine hundred away from him
he indicates in his departing words that
his stay is indefinite and his destination
problematical but he comes back on the
thirtieth day

  he pilgrims up from piperock with the
taste uh ashes in his mouth uh yaller hard
hat on his head and kid gloves on his hands
i hands him uh welcome and uh cigaret and
he humps up in my chair

  shes uh hard drag ike he states
the tribe i mentioned is either getting
scarce or somebody has declared uh closed
season on em i invades pittsburg and
chicago and other places too numerous to
mention but all i could find was folks who
were kind enough to listen while they took
uh drink on me when the drink was gone
they all lost their hearing ike

  did yuh expect to find capitalists in
grog shops i asked chiding like money-
ed men dont get drunk-they gets in-
toxicated didnt yuh do uh thing to be
thankful for magpie

  he shakes his head sad-like and fumbles
in his pocket after searching through all
his clothes he comes back to the first pocket
he looks in where it was all the time and
he knowed it and pulls out uh letter

  ike this is uh mystery he proclaims
honest to grandma i dont know what it
means but this letter says it was paid for
and is on its way here i didnt think i
got so drunk that i bought anything except
more drinks but-well take uh look at
this

  he hands me the letter at the top it
proclaims to be from the fur and feathers
pet shop of chicago they orates that
they handles each and everything what
wears fur and feathers and will supply
same with cheer and great speed the
letter reads like this

dear sir-

   as per your request and purchase we are shipping
you today one cassowary this is a male and
in case you desires uh female we can secure you one
inside of thirty days thanking you for past and
future favors we begs to remain-and so forth

  i hands the letter back to magpie and
rolls uh smoke

  the letter was waiting for me when i
got here he explains

  you dont need to apologize magpie

how much did yuh pay for this male bird
beast or reptile

  thats what i dont know ike im
sorry

  you always are magpie says i
you can be sorry more times hand
running than any man i ever seen you
were born to sorrow some folks are born
to sorrow but some are like me-they has
sorrow forced upon em whatll we do
with the danged thing

  how do i know he snaps at me
cassowary what in - is uh casso-
wary ike

  i ought to know i snaps right back at
him you must uh been pretty blamed
drunk magpie simpkins

  he nods solemn-like and spits at uh
lizard again

  maybe that eastern hooch is awful
stuff ike i dont remember no pet store
i must uh bought it the night i left chicago
for st louis i wakes up in the morning
and went to uh ticket office

  give me uh ticket to st louis says i
to the clerk

  he looks queer like at me and calls in

uh policeman and ike i had uh-of uh

time convincing that officer that i wasnt
crazy he explained to me that im already
in st louis

  them policemen must be uh near-
sighted bunch says i youd have uh
nice time trying to prove that to an officer
west uh dakota

  dont chide me ike says he i was
uh stranger in uh strange land and they
took me in anyway i got uh green and
red shirt uh civilized hat and uh necktie
pin to show for my trip

  dont forget cassie says i didnt
you talk mines uh-tall

  uh-huh there was uh fat bartender
in chicago who sympathized with me uh
heap said he wished id uh showed up
sooner with my proposition cause hed
sunk all his money in uh new diving appa-
ratus he sure was uh good old scout ike
dog-gone that feller could fix up uh drink
uh hooch until she tastes almost temperance
but she sure was uh sheep in wolfs clothes
i rode all the way from chicago to st louis
on three of em and didnt know it

the big question before the house is this
magpie is this here purchase uh yours uh
singer uh beast uh burden or uh nuisance
must be uh useful utensil ike or id never


adventure

bought it i may get red-eyed from wobble
water but i never loses my sense uh useful
and ornamental things im what youd
call uh discerning person-drunk or sober
all uh which shows that there aint no
use arguing with magpie simpkins he
can do no wrong uh course he might do
things that hed be sorry for but he never
figures that hes wrong-just uh little mis-
taken for the time being

  come back broke i asks

  uh-huh my gosh ike i must uh
spent money like uh timber willie if i
knowed what that animile cost me i could
figure how much the trip cost me

  you dont have to let x equal the miss-
ing quantity magpie says i you
had nine hundred when yuh left and youre
broke now therefore the trip cost me
four hundred and fifty sabe

  magpie dont sleep well that night
first he has an argument with that chicago
bartender uh course me being an inno-
cent bystander or bylayer i gets hit in
the nose i cautions him to fight the other
way he apologizes uh heap but inside
uh five minutes he starts another fight with
some colored person over the way his bed
is made and i gets pitched out of the
bunk and hits my head on the stove

  ive been mistook for an injun and one
time red river radkey absorbs too much
of the fermented foam and mistakes me
for uh pink pollywog but thats the first
time that anybody ever mistook me for
uh colored porter and it makes me mad

  i climbs right back on that bunk gets
magpie by the feet and drags him around
the yard in the moonlight hes plumb
awake and docile enough to apologize again
when i finishes the third lap around the
woodpile so he climbs back on the bunk
and i takes uh blanket and sleeps on the floor

the next morning we saddles our
burros and starts for town were
out uh spuds and we needs some
drill steel magpie leads the procession
setting on the rump of uh fuzzy-looking
jackass hes wearing that hard hat
green and red shirt-he sheds his vest-
and on his hands he wears them gray gloves
he sure is uh thing to see even the burros
acts bashful around him

  i reckon ill make the inhabitants uh
piperock set up and take notice he states
admiring himself

  he sets the pot-shaped hat on the peak
of his head and brushes off that loco shirt
with his gloves

  yes says i all i hope is that they
dont set up with uh gun in their hands
you sure look like uh cross between uh
lodge-pole christmas tree and uh zebra
we pilgrims down to the main road and
ambles through the dust in the direction
of piperock we comes to uh turn in the
road where we sees uh man setting along-
side on uh rock hes all humped up with
his head between his hands and dont look
up until i hails him then we recognizes
him as being chuck warner puncher for
the cross-j i never did know just how
to take that feller he never growed none
to speak of from his waist on down and i
figures that hes the honestest-looking liar
i ever met he sets there on that rock
sad-like but when he sizes up our outfit
his eyes gets bigger and he sort uh gasps

 my- it must be true

  too true i replies glancing at magpie
too true

  he gets off the rock and wobbles over to
us his eyes are blood-shot like hed been
dallying unduly with the cheerful fluid
and he squints at magpie

  its magpie simpkins in disguise
chuck says i

  huh says he sort uh relieved like
maybe i aint so bad as i thought you
fellers got time to help out uh pilgrim in
doubt

  your obedient servants says i lead
us to the doubt

  he turns and ambles off across the
country and me and magpie is right
behind him about two hundred yards
from the road he stops and points across
an open spot

  thats my bronc he states yessir
thats my little hawse but but-say what

in-is on that rope uh mine eh

  fluttering fool-hens explodes magpie
fanning himself with his civilized hat

  i looks and swallers uh chaw uh natural
leaf

  do-do you see it too asks chuck
just exactly states magpie what
is it

  if it aint the granddaddy uh all blue
grouse ill eat my hat orates chuck
yuh see i been down to piperock for three
days trying to bust bucks wheel and
drink all the hooch in town i comes along
upside down or backwards



the road this morning singing merrily
when i happens to see that busted crate
in the road i pulls up to see what it is
and my bronc danged near dumps me off
hes scared at something in the brush and
when i spurs him over to see what it is
we scares out that blasted thing

  not being responsible for my actions
i takes down my rope and proceeds to
annex the thing between that thing and
my bronc they makes life miserable for me
so i gets off and leaves em to their fate
the rope is wound around the bush between
em so they cant do nothing but stand
there and contemplate each other

   i dont reckon theres any doubt about
it being uh grown bird states magpie
fussing with uh cigaret

  your perceptions are wide open mag-
pie nods chuck wonder where it flew
from it aint no grouse nor yet it dont
partake of any of the requirements of the
fool-hen it might uh been uh humming-
bird about the time this here world was
started

  shes sure uh hummer i agrees if
id been born with uh neck like that id
uh died from delirium tremens years ago

   id opine that somebody done lost that
crate off uh wagon and maybe theres
something around to tell what and whose
it is says magpie

  we all pilgrims back to the road and
chuck leads us to the busted bunch uh
slats on one side it says-

do not tease

   on the other side in letters uh foot high
it says-

     magpie simpkins
     piperock
     montana

   we reads it over several times and then
magpie steps back cocks his yaller hat over
one eye sticks his thumbs in his belt and
snorts-

   that is cassie

   make it caspar says i its uh male
cassowary magpie

  huh snorts chuck you wise guys
knowed all the time what it was didnt yuh
what yuh going to do with the thing

what in-is it anyway

that thing chuck says i is what

uh man buys in the east when hes drunk
up seven hundred dollars worth uh mixed
hooch cassowary is uh french word
what means something yuh bought when
youre too drunk to consider the expense
and necessity 

  i always did like the french language
states chuck it sure is expressive that-
away cause yuh dont have to say much
to mean uh whole lot my mother was
french name was jones yuh pro-
nounces it hones the j being silent like
the q in cassowary

  well says i we got to do something
and being as it belongs to you magpie
i reckon yuh better suggest

  but magpie sucks away on that cigaret
and shakes his head

  id admire to hear all about it states
chuck there must be uh deep and dark
mystery about that bird magpie if i
knowed the details about that birds past
maybe i could help yuh out

  magpie is willing to receive help-as
usual-so he sets down there and tells
chuck all about it -what he can remember

  how much do yuh think yuh paid for
it asks chuck you sure ought to
remember that part of it

  dang me if i know replies magpie
couple uh hundred most likely what
yuh got on your mind chuck

  say what good is uh cassowary if
she was worth something to humanity we
might peddle the blasted thing if folks
had an idea it was-cripes

  whats the exciting thought chuck
i asks but chuck begins to roll uh fresh
cigaret and grin to himself pretty soon
he busts out laughing and slaps his quirt
across his chaps

  by cripes he chuckles it wont cost
nothing to try

  try what asks magpie

  say if you gets your two hundred back
will yuh give me all i can make over
that

  you answered ycir own question
chuck declares magpie you get us two
hundred for that overgrown fool-hen and
you can have the rest what yuh going
to do

  thats my business magpie you and
ike go along ahut your business and dont
peep-no matter what happens sabe
here comes the stage

  art miller swings his four broncs around


adventure

in front of us and looks us over sort uh
grouchy like

try

  art spits over his off-wheeler and con-
siders the busted crate

  did yuh see what comes in that there

his hat on the brake lever and fumbles for
his tobacco

dest things sent to you what yuh going

gone never heard the name before
the way scenery pronounces it makes it
sound like uh hare-lipped piegan with hay
fever trying to make uh noise like uh
blowsnake

plies it sure cant amount to much if
scenery and dirty shirt knows what it
is so i aint worrying about it none

  the next day comes old judge steele and
ricky henderson they salutes us and

the way that quartz seam shows up and
when we leaves there were out uh grub

rock and get uh banquet uh ham and aigs
and im right with him so we points our
burros toward town

  magpie is still wearing that yaller hard
hat the burro hes riding turns its head
once in uh while and looks back it sizes
him up shakes its ears sad like and pil-
grims on magpie sure is dressed up like
uh plush horse and all he needs is uh cane
to be uh cripple for life

  there seems to be uh certain degree of
excitement in piperock when we arrives
chuck warner is setting on his bronc out
there in the middle of the street and hes
surrounded with uh crowd lying down
in the dusty road is that blasted bird that
magpie bought and uh rope runs from
chucks saddle to its long neck the bird
seems to be the coolest thing in town

adventure

  that seems to suit the crowd so chuck
puts the bird in buck mastersons stable
and him and some of the rest gets busy
on making tickets

  me and magpie sets there on the sidewalk
and wonders what them jaspers want of
that bird art miller comes over but he
dont know any more than we do

  how comes it that everybody covets
that monstrosity art i asks but art
shakes his head and digs his toes in the
dirt

  danged if i know ike i never seen
folks so crazy before i felt that theres
something in the wind for several days
tellurium half mile scenery ricky
dirty shirt and judge steele has been in
conference several times up in the judges
office here comes tellurium maybe
hell tell us what it means

     tellurium sets down with us
for uh minute and then gets up and
turns around three times like uh
losing gambler does to change his luck

  id admire to know what you wants
that freak bird for tellurium states art

  you would eh chuckles tellurium
hauling some pieces uh paper out of his
pocket and putting em into another
you would eh dont you know art

  i wouldnt ask if i did

  tellurium fusses around in his inside
pocket and hauls out uh piece uh writing-
paper

  i reckon the tickets are all sold now
so it wont do no harm to let yuh know
says he handing art the paper i done
invested seventy-five on my luck but i
reckon you fellers are too late to even buy
one ticket when i left judge steele and
half mile was quarreling over who gets
the last number read that letter and be
sorry yuh didnt buy no chances we
dont know who it was written to but we
figures that it was some uh them citified
prospectors what was through here uh
short time ago we found it on the floor
in bucks place and thats what brought
us up to your place that day ike

  the three of us groups there on the side-
walk and reads what is left of that epistle
the top and one corner is torn off but that
is how she reads from that on down

-little information some geologist friends of
mine were down in that country last summer and
they brought me the track of a bird-dried in alkali

mud the measurements and peculiar arrange-
ment of the toes show it to be the track of a railami
a bird that is believed to have been extinct for many
years the imprint is of recent times-not over six
months-and without a doubt in the vicinity of the
town of piperock lives and roams a specimen of this
rare bird it greatly resembles an ostrich in size
and characteristics but as there are no ostriches
in that country it would be difficult to mistake
anything else for this rare bird i would be willing
to give one thousand dollars for this specimen alive
and will gladly welcome any information you can
send me very truly yours

c ewein chxjrch new york n y

  my- snorts magpie here weve

had uh thousand dollars running loose
around here and didnt know it aint that
the limit

  just uh case of grasping an opportunity
when she comes your way chuckles tel-
lurium looking at his tickets again some
of us are wide awake around here

  uh-huh i agrees as far as im
concerned i tries to get my regular sleep
tellurium pilgrims back across the street
and pretty soon we opines that we might
as well go and see whats doing so we enters
bucks place chuck leads the bird in and
ties it to uh leg of the pool-table the bird
squats down on the floor and chuck mounts
uh chair

  gents says he yelling for order we
are gathered together here to raffle off uh
bird that nobody seems to know nothing
about i puts my rope on it and being
it dont show no brand i claims it as mine
am i right

  according to law chuck admits the
judge 

  being all tilings is so we will proceed
to rsffle off said bird gents will the first
number out of the hat win the bird or will
we draw more before the lucky number
comes to view

  make it three draws squeaks scenery
third number out wins

  the bunch seems satisfied so chuck
takes up the hat-with the numbers in and
begins to shake em up

  who will do the drawing asks the
judge we got to have this all according
to law

  you cant judge states tellurium
you got too many chances lets get
somebody what aint got no interest let
ike harper do it

  i didnt want to be mixed up in the thing
uh-tall but uh feller cant refuse uh simple
request like that so i moves into position
upside down or backwards



  let her go ike squeaks scenery if
you draws my number ill make you uh
present of uh calf

  just uh minute yells the judge
that sounds to me like he was trying to
bribe or coerce the drawee scenery you
keep your mouth shut id be willing
to make mister harper uh present of uh
calf if he drawed my number but i aint
proclaiming it

  i reaches up twice and tears up the two
numbers that i draws

  this one tells the tale says somebody
excited like as i pulls it out and hands it
to chuck

  he unfolds it and squints hard at the
number turning it around and around

  number-uh-say ike what number
is that

  looks like uh sixteen to me says i and
scenery whoops

  thats mi-i-i-i-ine i got sixte-e-e-
e-e-en whooe-e-e-e-e

 wait uh minute howls chuck
maybe i was wrong ike but take uh
look at it the other way if that aint uh
nine-

  thats mine whoops dirty shirt

dog-gone i knowed-

  looks like ninety-one says i

 my number my number whoops
the judge ninety-one wins

  the judge comes clawing his way to the
front and the whole crowd starts milling
around me

  ouch yelps ricky above the noise
let loose wow that danged pelican
bit me on the leg

  i claims that bird yells the judge
lead her out to me ricky

  like - he will howls scenery

climbing up on the bar and shaking his
number under the judges nose just be-
cause you misrepresents the law judge it
dont give yuh no rights to take property
away from honest men

  lets live inpeace and harmony states
buck masterson sliding his double-barreled
shotgun across the bar and covering the
crowd everybody shut up and listen
to me look at the tickets in the hat and
maybe yuh can settle this argument
your wisdom is to be applauded buck
says chuck sheath that cemetery pro-
moter and well rest easier and think
clearer ricky give me that hat with the
tickets in

  wheres your danged hat asks ricky
down on his hands and knees under the
table if it was down here-let loose
you cross between uh shanghai rooster and
uh giraffe huh

  rickys hand comes up over the table-top
and produces one square of white paper

  your hats still here chuck but that
danged bird has ate up all the tickets except
that number thirteen i took that away
from him and-ouch yuh will will yuh

  biff coo-oo-orlook

  ricky must uh kicked that bird for get-
ting familiar cause it comes right up into
our midst with dangerous intent written
on its countenance

i love birds maw used to have
uh canary and i cried when it
passed out i got uh lot uh feath-
ered friends and i never met uh bird be-
fore that even attempted to kick me

i dont think that thing was uh bird in
the first place id call it uh cross between
uh mean disposition and uh piledriver
cause it kicked ike harper esq right
where he wears his pancakes ike harper
immediate and soon skids across the floor
and plays uh billiard off judge steele and
buck masterson and finishes up by holing
out under uh chair

  i peeks out from my ambush and observes
that alleged bird leave that low grog-shop
with scenery hanging on to its neck and
dirty shirt hold of its tail somebody -
must uh cut that rope the rest of the
audience except me and buck and the
judge foilers in the rear

  i must uh hit buck and the judge pretty
hard buck has got uh cut over his eye
where he bumped against the bar on his
way down and the judge fell between the
bar and the rail with his feet under the
rail

  i hauls the judge around so his back is
against the bar with the rail across his- lap
and folds his hands then i helps buck
into uh chair where he sets and makes
funny little noises

  railami states the judge without
opening his eyes

  z-z-z-mnkujj  says i

  uf-uf-uf-fuf says buck

  it sure was an intelligible conversation

it was just about sensible enough for uh
gathering like that and we all enjoyed it
sudden like the noise starts percolating


adventure

down the street again and i starts for the
door i said i started and thats as far
as i got pete gonyers pet coyote pup
must uh wanted uh railami too and it
wasnt below its dignity to come right into
uh saloon to get it either

  in they comes crowding each other for
first place and starts making a three-ring
circus out uh bucks place id tell uh
man that there was something going on in
there that stilt-legged overgrown fool-
hen sure can cut circles and that pup aint
no slouch either all outdoors seems to
beckon that bird but he dont sabe mirrors
he cuts his last lap about two feet in the
lead of that pup hops high wide and
handsome to the top of the bar and meets
itself in bucks bar-mirror

  bounce say that bird simply turns
over in the air and comes back like uh
rubber ball the coyote is yelping its
fool head off trying to climb the bar when
that mass uh feathers and legs hits him
dead center on the rebound

  scenery sims is just staggering in the
door when that pup opines he can hear his
maw calling him and he tangles with poor
little scenery on his way out scenery
loses his feet so as long as he aint got no
visible means of support he sets down on
the back of his neck and that demented
thing that magpie bought meets its original
owner right in the doorway and they goes
into the street together

  six-te-e-e-e-en shrieks scenery claw-
ing at his head where it had banged against
uh chair-leg

  ninety-one croaks the judge clawing
at the bar-rail across his lap

  pass declared buck vacant like and
just then doughgod smith weaves in

  he looks us over foolish like squints
hard at the judge under the rail and then
shakes his head and starts for the door

  whats the matter dud-dud-dough-
god stutters buck

  de-de-de-delirium tut-tut-tut-tremens
stutters doughgod right back at him

  he flops his arms and sighs deep

  no use he states must be uh lot
uh lye in hooch thatll make uh feller see
things like that it was standing down the
road with its head under uh hard hat-
uh yaller one he shrieked the last sen-
tence and lopes out to his bronc and
away he goes

  head under uh hat whoops scenery

my- hid out like uh ostrich and

then he lopes out of the door

  i got uh claim to settle too announces
the judge

  he slides out from under that rail hitches
up his belt and gallops after scenery

  magpie ambles in the door snorts the
dust out of his nose and chuck warner
is right behind him chuck looks like hed
been through a revolution he weaves
over to the pool-table gets down on his
knees and searches the floor he shakes
his head solemn like and searches his
pockets once more

  pretty soon he gets back on his feet and
wobbles up to the bar

  buck you got any caster ile he asks
i had all that raffle money in my pocket
and i reckon that danged cross between
uh greyhound and uh duck must uh ate it
up with them tickets i cant find nothing
but uh five-dollar bill in my pocket

  lets see the bill chuck says buck
and chuck hands it to him

  thanks says buck it aint much
but it will help to pay for that glass
dog-gone yuh buck wails chuck
leaning against the bar that bird aint
mine it lays between scenery sims and
judge steele

  the - it does squeaks scenery

from the doorway that bird is too active
to lay

  he walks over to magpie and slams that
yaller hat down over his head until his ears
stand out like sails

  take your danged pot hat magpie
he snaps nobody ought to wear uh hat
like that will some strong unwounded
man go out and bring in the judge he
took that thousand-dollar bird beast or
reptile by the leg while i takes the hat off
its head id uh carried him in but i aint
able to do much i suppose i got to own
that bird

  dont worry too much about it scen-
ery advises buck if the judge opines
that his number wins you got to fight it
out among yourselves if the judge dont
survive i reckon hes got an heir some place
to take it up

  air- squeaks scenery he was

trying to get some when i left that thing
can give uh mule high low and the game
and win

  just then in comes the judge with
tellurium half mile and dirty shirt
upside down or backwards



helping to support him they sets him
in uh chair and he droops like uh wilted
lily

  how do yuh feel judge i asks
paralyzed from the belt-line both ways
ike says he painful like i dont reckon
the shadder uh death is afar off i sure

have had particular-kicked out uh me

this day and date

  how about your claim to that bird now

iudge squeaks scenery ill fight it-

  go to it wheezes the judge ill pay

grieves to think i ever coveted such uh
piece uh property

  ill take it whoops scenery

  with certain formalities scenery
states tellurium wise like producing uh
piece uh paper and unfolding same this
here proclamation was picked up this day
in the street of piperock and unless ive
forgot all the botany i ever learned in
school we been bidding on the wrong bird
you might pe-ruse it scenery

  he looks at me and magpie and hands
the letter to scenery i leans close enough
to see that its the letter that magpie got
announcing the shipment from the fur
and feathers pet shop scenery spells it
out with uh squeak after each word

  cassowary he snorts at tellurium
and then he turns appealing like to magpie
you aint going to send for another one
are you honest yuh aint are yuh
magpie

  ker-boomi ker-bang

bthe house shakes with the con-
cussion and buck drops uh glass
hes been polishing for ten minutes
he looks under the bar and gasps-

  my riot-gun

  we sets there and looks at each other
for uh minute and then the judge runs his
fingers painful like through his hair and
orates in uh peevish wailing tone-

  well dang it all send for uh doctor or
uh coroner

  somebody starts to get both when the
door flies open and in walks chuck he
nmbles the length of the room and slams
the shotgun down on the bar

  - he snorts i shot its crop all

to -

  is-is it dead quavers the judge

  i dont know judge replies chuck
weary like it was when i left

joshing well i was standing over there
by that shotgun after buck puts it back
on the bar and unless im mistaken i sort
uh absent-minded like shoved it into the

muzzle uh that gun im sorry-

  youre welcome states chuck offhand
like it looks to me like id shot the

business all to - with the profits i

lose eleven dollars and four cents on the deal 
what i want to know is this is that
bird critter still in the land of the living
interrupts scenery sims

  what i want to know is-has somebody

then me and magpie and chuck goes outside

aig is dead and your two hundred is all shot

a stiif-t into reverse
      rog p churchill

author of danny takes a chance the welding etc

his dugan is ruinin the second
division somebody oughter
make him lay off that poor
bunch of long-timers show about
as much pep when hes through with em
as a charge of black powder thats been
overboard what ails him

  slim higgins was speaking he and
dick reasoner were stopping their scrub-
and-wash clothes on the line the decks
of the united states training-ship dixie
were still half dark and the long line of
wet clothing which would be triced up
before sunup hid another man near enough
the two to overhear this man stooped
under the line and faced slim higgins

  whats it to you he growled menac-
ingly any old time you want to butt
in on my business hop to it you and
any other stool-pidgeoning rate thats look-
ing for trouble

  this was cain dugan a burly thick-
chested boatswains mate who had taken
the paid-off billy yonts place at the last
home-coming of the ship he turned from
higgins to reasoner for while he had
successfully cowed the leaders and the
men of the other divisions he had been
unable to fathom this tall slow-moving
even-tempered master-at-arms

  weill he demanded thrusting forward

  his heavy black-bearded jaw and doubling
  his fists until the muscle-corded arms
  ridged into knotty lumps this signal-
  stick asked you a question im waiting
  for the answer

    it was dugans boast that he did not
  fear god man or devil and the manner
  of his life bore out his statement for he
  and the devil were cronies he did not
  know god and he was a master of men

    reasoner laughed easily laughed in
  the others face as calmly as much without
  anger and without fear as if it was his
  every-day job to be threatened

    dont get excited dugan he said
  if you care to listen ill go on and tell
  slim what he wants to know

    dugan relaxed sooner or later he would
  get a chance at this fellow but this did not
  seem the time

     go on he said sullenly

    youre too hard on the recruits every
  officer on the ship knows it but they are
  hoping youll improve

    i know you tattled everything aft
  interrupted dugan

    reasoner ignored him this was rank
  insult to an enlisted man but no one had
  yet been able to stampede dick reasoner
  and a man of dugans stamp should have
  known better than to try when reasoner
  
a shift into reverse



was ready he would act and all the
dugans in the world could not make him
lose his head

   you are not apt to improve he con-
tinued but i want to give you a little
warning that second division itself is
the thing you want to look out for you
cant drive a bunch of youngsters like that
too far they will kick back in the end
thats the comfort i wanted to give slim
and im glad you could hear it

   whatll we call it scoffed dugan
this whole ships company act like a lot
of sunday-school teachers one real he-
man in the bunch is treated as a freak
that gang of sissies in my division havent
enough real manhood to animate a jelly-
fish me afraid of them why i could
pierce all their noses and make em wear
rings in em

  reasoner had finished what he had to
say he turned from dugan and began
to get his things together dugan ducked
under the line and a few minutes later
had crowded one of his division from a
favored place at the line and began to hang
up his clothes

   as slim higgins and reasoner went aft
to other duties slims unspoken question
was answered by his companion

  hes a tough nut slim youre won-
dering why i took the guff i did but a fist-
fight wont cure that fellow hes used
to that hed put up an awful scrap and
even if i could best him would still brow-
beat his division as bad as ever i have
looked him up in the book the word is
bide and it means to suffer and wait for
that second division will not stand for the
treatment he gives them and sooner or later
its time will come thats why im wait-
ing maybe itll help dugan

   the only way you can cure a man like
that is to shoot him with a bird gun at
three paees said slim i know you
always dodge a fight until the last minute
but you are goin to have to lick this dugan
or he licks you pretty pronto

  dictionary dick shook his head he
was opposed to violence the little worn
dictionary which he kept in his sea-chest
and sometimes in his blouse carried many
solutions besides fight to settle a
vexed question he looked for an answer
in the book everythings in it was
one of his favorite retorts to criticism
all you have to do is to find the right

  word and his shipmates on the dixie
had long since ceased to hold lightly the
advice he gave somehow things had a
way of working out as reasoner said
and the officers turned over to him many
strange problems among the recruits which
the training on the dixie was to make fit
for places in the big fleet

  and dictionary dick usually found a
way out in this case it was a petty
officer who was causing trouble like a
happy family the ships company of the
dixie had taken on draft after draft of
recruits had worked together molding
and fitting them for duty until billy
yonts chief petty-officer of the second
division was paid off and dugan had come
to take his place

  the second division is falling behind
complained the first lieutenant whats
the trouble dugan

  this was a week after the conversation
at the wash-line the men were lined up
for inspection and the second had showed
up poorer than usual in the morning drill
it had been away all boats and the
division had failed to provide all their
equipment had rowed raggedly and had
not kept up in the evolutions the men
were nervous and full of false movements
and the vicious string of commands from
dugan made them worse instead of better

  theyre a bunch of quitters sir said
dugan putting all the contempt that he
could into the words and making them
loud enough so that all the division heard

  youre here to help train the men
not find fault with them spoke the first
lieutenant sharply find out the cause
and correct it

  this dugan proceeded to do in his own
way the division had no rest from him
more than half the men went on the report
for trivial infractions of the rules and all
went about their tasks jerkily at the
next inspection they had not improved
and their nervousness had given place to
a sullen resentment at all authority in
general and to cain dugan in particular
the first lieutenant sent for dugan

  your division is not improving he
said severely they havent been going
ahead since yonts was paid off and now
they are going back is it you or the men

  yonts babied them too much sir said
dugan theyre spoiled but give me
time and ill break them


adventure

  the first lieutenant shook his head

  i dont know about that maybe you
are too hard on them try easing up
aye aye sir said dugan with as
much anger as he dared and from then on
drove the division harder than ever

again it was early morning and
the men were stopping their clothes
on the line little bryan weber
of the second had crept out of his hammock
half an hour early and had just finished
up a big wash at the line dugan shoved
him aside and took his place-a place
forward where the wet clothing was in no
danger of swinging against the stays and
being soiled this was not the first time
that little weber had been roughly handled
by dugan the other times he had been
afraid to resent it but now after weeks of
bad treatment he could stand it no longer
and revolted

  get out of my place he cried shrilly
i was there first

  dugan paid no attention with his
back turned he was impudently unconscious
of the other

  bryan weber was small and slight and
had come into the navy with the hard-
won consent of his parents when he was
barely seventeen but he was manly and
studious and under the tutelage of billy
yonts had made good progress dugan
had taken a special dislike to him and
continually gave him the worst end of all
the watches and lookouts

  robbed of his place and ignored weber
was beside himself with rage and humili-
ation and cain dugan had the surprise of
his bullying life when the boy charged
striking blindly with both fists

  why you little devil said dugan
havent i taught you anything yet
and he struck with one of his big fists

  the boy whirled dizzily and fell back-
ward across the deck at the feet of dick
reasoner dugan followed and raised his
foot to kick him where he lay stunned
the foot was bare but a sailors bare
tough toes are not the ineffectual weapons
of a shoe-wearing man

  thatll do said reasoner stepping
over the boy and facing the angry dugan

  for you yes but it wont do for me
out of the way or ill paste you

  reasoner did not answer behind him
bryan weber crawled to his feet and

lurched unsteadily away across the deck
dugan started after him

  thatll do repeated reasoner sharply
his tone was commanding and the words
those of a man who expected to be obeyed
dugan took the challenge

  we might as well settle it now he said
youve butted in once too often into my
business

  both men were barefoot and faced
each other across a length of wet deck
slippery with soap from the clothes-scrub-
bing they wore undershirts and trousers
and in the half light of the early morning
were safe from interference from aft

  cain dugan had won his many rough-
and-tumble fights by bull rushes and his
ability to stand punishment he was not
ignorant of the finer rules and science of
boxing but chose to ignore them for a
freer display of his brute strength his
game was to tear his opponent down over-
whelm his defense trample him under foot
without further warning he drove in
striking wickedly

  reasoner met the attack unexpectedly
other men had always given way before
dugans vicious rush it was to be ex-
pected that this rather slow and reluctant
opponent would do the same but dick
reasoner was no longer slow his body
stiffened as if the material in him had been
suddenly tempered into spring steel his
long loose-jointed frame drew into itself
became compact finely knit a working
unit of perfectly coordinated parts du-
gans rush met a swifter one from the made-
over reasoner before his adversary could
gather momentum he had landed two
punishing blows where they would do the
most good dugan shook his head side-
ways to offset the shock and stepped back
his charge had been ruined by this quick
counter attack

  reasoner gave him no rest no chance
to draw breath all the half-forgotten
science that he had ignored dugan used
for defense and all his wonderful store of
strength he called on to withstand the
shower of blows as he fought he threat-
ened and abused but the silent reasoner
met all his rushes with swifter attacks and
continued to lash out blows that dugan at
first ignored and then came to dread

  it does my heart good to see old dic-
tionary dick in action said slim higgins
to the group that surrounded the two men
a shift into reverse



dugan had it in his head that he was
boss of the ship i guess thisll throw a
crimp into him dicks wearin him out

  dugan realized at last that he was
getting the worst of the fight it made
him furious and he began to use his head
covering up as best he could he saved
his strength for another rush it was
getting lighter and by reasoners side
was a spot of soapy deck he maneuvered
to get reasoner on it

  slim higgins saw the danger

  look out for the soap to the left dick
he called hes workin you over to it

  the warning came too late dugan
rushed with all the power of his carefully
hoarded strength reasoner slipped on
the soap and went down before he could
get up dugan had leaped at his prostrate
body feet first what he meant to do
was to put reasoner out by jumping on
him with his one hundred and eighty
pounds reasoner squirmed aside and
as dugan tried again lay face up on the
deck

  shame let him get up cried those
watching

  a navy fist-fight has one clearly defined
rule there are no rounds but when
a man is down the other man must let
him get to his feet before he attacks again

  the interference was unnecessary in
this case as dugan jumped reasoner
struck upward with his feet catching
dugan in the stomach it was a blow
delivered with all the tense strength of
reasoners powerful body from the hunched
shoulders and neck braced by the deck
up through the muscular back and legs
to the balls of his hard feet dugan
grunted as they struck him and his weight
sagged down inertly over reasoner who
with another heave threw him backward
to the deck dugan did not get up

  the word is cul-de-sac said reasoner
getting up slowly and assuming his usual
drawl i looked it up last week it
means when you are hemmed in and no
way out but to fight

  cain dugan did not mend his ways
with the second division he recognized
no power but force and while he respected
reasoner he felt that no other man on
the ship had a right to consideration but
even under his increased driving the
division began to improve in its work

  how do you account for it asked

slim dugan is about as bad as ever
with his bunch but theyre doin better
theyre snappier in the drills and dont
look so hopeless

  they are beginning to see that dugan
isnt invincible said reasoner their
self-respect is returning half a dozen
of them will be getting together and giving
him a licking some shore leave and it is
his own doing for hes driving the lesson
into them every day that might is right
is that dope in the book

  the word is rebellion ive just
finished telling you what it means

  heres a good one said slim and
it fits the case oh why should the head
of a mortal be bone batty mcginnis
sprung it on me when he was watchin this
dugan makin it hard on the weber kid
and batty told me something else hes
been shipmates with dugan before when
dugan was paid off on his first cruise he
married and intended to stay on the out-
side but in six months or less he was back
worse than ever his wife couldnt put
up with his ways and she divorced him for
cruelty hes a bad hombre i hope the
division gives it to him good when they
do get a chance

  you say hes making it hard for little
weber

  yes makin him scrub clothes for him
and soakin him all the extra duty he dares
but he hasnt got the kid bluffed even
if he thinks he has him crawlin in the dust
just as you say hes waitin a chance
and lettin dugan think hes a willin slave
until he gets a poke at him he slipped
me this news too he found a letter in
one of dugans pockets when he was wash-
in out a suit he read it and then threw
it overboard it was from dugans wife
tellin him she was married again and to
stop writin threatenin letters or she would
turn em over to the police

      just after the mid-watch came on
swck two nights after slim and reasoner
ivqffl jiaj talked over dugans case and
the second division the radio man on
watch caught a message which made him
send a messenger-boy hurrying to the
officer of the deck that officer woke the
first lieutenant and after a few minutes
investigation the captain was called the
passenger steamer senator was afire and
the fire was beyond control of the crew


adventure

being forward the ship was afraid to run
into the wind toward shore on account of
fanning the flames aft and they were
asking for help

  the dixie was a bare hundred miles
away and the nearest other ship was three
times that it- was up to the training-ship
the senator carried a big passenger-list
and a good part of her cargo was ammu-
nition when the dixie picked her up
she asked that rescue hurry as the passen-
gers were demanding to be allowed to take
to the boats which the officers refused to do
as long as the senator could steam back-
ward toward land and there was a chance
of getting control of the fire

  the dixie answered that she was coming
at full speed and the final word from the
senator was that the fire was gaining and
there would be barely time to get the
passengers to safety before the ammunition
would be in danger she had changed her
course and was running toward the dixie
with the offshore wind on her beam

  we will sight her before daylight
said the captain we are making eighteen
knots and she about fifteen that will
give us about three hours let the crew
sleep for two of them and then call the
fire and rescue party

  aye aye sir answered the first
lieutenant the boats crews will need
all the rest they can get i would suggest
sir that i have the cooks called so the men
may have their breakfast before they are
called away

  lighting up the sky just as the dawn was
lighting the east the lookouts caught their
first glimpse of the burning ship an angry
red glow topped with smoke almost hid
her forward decks the wireless was silent
half an hour before the office had been
burned out and the last message had been
hurry

  mustered around the dixies decks were
the members of the fire and rescue party
most of the men who were to handle the
boats with the boarding party were from
the second division and cain dugan was
in charge the other divisions were cast-
ing off the securing lines and getting their
own boats provided and ready to rig out

  get them all ready was the first
lieutenants order the senators boats
will be overloaded and some of them are
too far forward to use

  as the ships drew nearer together the

senator stopped her engines and began to
lower her after boats the sea was smooth
and the launching not difficult

  do not overload the boats signaled
the dixie we will use ours to supplement
yours

  it was soon light enough to see the men
and women lining the after rails of the ship
and the groups around the boats

  the dixie was now close in and as soon
as her way was stopped the order came
away fire and rescue party the first
men went in the two lifeboats with only
the regular crew and hospital steward
the cutters and launches would follow
and some of them carry the artificers
portable extinguisher detail and artificial
breathing apparatus the first boats were
to rescue the lives and the others to fight
the fire if it were feasible

  running alongside the burning ship the
boats filled to capacity and returned to
the dixie then went back for another
load it was hard exciting work the
passengers came first some of them cool
some half-hysterical most of them insisting
on bringing their baggage the dixies
men mingled with the crew of the senator
lifting children and women into the boats
comforting the frightened keeping back
the cowardly able-bodied who pushed for-
ward for first places

  cain dugan had returned for his second
load the senators boats and those from
the dixie had thinned out the passengers
dugan was his usual self on his first trip
he had quarreled with a sailor from the
senator and knocked the man down when
he sought to take a place in the boat

  get out he said harshly well get
you in plenty of time

  but the man came on and dugan struck
him not until then did he see that the
man was badly burned

  served him right he growled
shovin in why didnt he say he was
hurt

  you didnt give him time expostu-
lated the hospital steward i intend to
report you for it

  all this had not improved dugans
temper on the way over he had abused
his crew for slowness when they were
rowing as if in a race for the fact that
they were taking part in a rescue and
that the fire might reach the ammunition
on the senator and blow her up at any
a shift into reverse

ioi

minute was stimulation enough for the
youngsters until dugan railed at them
they had forgotten how they hated him

  alongside the senator a few passengers
and a part of the crew who had been re-
lieved from the fire-fighting came into the
boat at once but when there was still
room for half a dozen more they stopped
coming dugan stepped out of the boat
and ran up the ships gangway to the deck
he wanted to get a full load before he
shoved off

  a man met him at the top he wore
no hat his face was scorched his eyes red

  help he cried in a voice full of
anxiety

  shut up yappin ordered dugan
you grown men give me a pain actin
like a lot of babies

  my wife explained the man resenting
the others tone not me i want help
to get her up from below

  where below

  dont stand there asking questions but
get some more of your crew and come
dugan realized that the mans emotions
were not fear for himself but worry for
some one else

  all right he agreed and called down
to the boat come on deck one of you
the men hesitated weber desig-
nated dugan used to calling on the boy
for extra tasks and in a moment he joined
dugan and the passenger and the three
ran down the deck toward the fire as
they went the man explained

  when the fire-alarm came i went to
help with the fire and my wife said she
would call the other passengers near us
they put me where i couldnt get away
and for hours i havent seen her i have
watched every boat that was loaded
between times i have searched the state-
room and all those near it the smoke
is awful down there and she has been over-
come and is lying unconscious somewhere
i want you to help me find her

  in the passage alongside the staterooms
the smoke became worse as the three men
went forward

  a little more of this and i go back
objected dugan your wife probably
went in one of the boats while you were
looking at another

  this is our stateroom said the man
ill look once more to be sure

  dugan and weber followed

  inside the room the smoke was not so
dense and a woman tottered toward their
guide from where she had been lying
across the bunk

  john she cried ive been looking
everywhere for you i was afraid you
were hurt take me out of here
thaman put his arm around the woman
and turned toward the door

  yes dear he said soothingly there
are plenty of boats here are two men
from the rescue ship we will go now

dugan had been behind the man
and the woman had not yet seen
him but bryan weber had seen
the shock of surprise followed by the
spasm of hate which went over his features
as he heard the woman speak and then
looked from behind her husband at her
face the mans revolver lay on a small
table at one side of the room dugan
stepped quickly forward and secured it

  the womans eyes followed him fasci-
nated

  cain she cried cain dugan stop
him john hell kill you

  her voice rose into the hysterical note of
absolute terror and as her husband turned
toward dugan she repeated the warning
in a barely audible whisper as she passed
into unconsciousness

  yes alice said cain dugan addressing
the woman as if she could still hear what
he was saying the devil is good to his
own i knew that the big chance would
come i intend to kill this home-breaker
before your eyes just as i have always
sworn to do

  dugan was so full of his anger that he
did not realize at first that the limp form
of the woman in her husbands arms could
not hear what he had to say then he
addressed the man

  so you are john ryan ill show you
how to break up a mans home

  ryan did not answer

  everything has happened so well for
me continued dugan his words charged
with sneering triumph i will shoot you
in a moment and then carry the woman
out to the boats she has fainted and
wont see me do it but then that allows
me to tell my own tale when i come to trial
a man mustnt expect too much

  john ryan was no coward as he faced
dugans deadly rage his eyes did not waver


adventure

and his brain went over swiftly every detail
of escape that he could think of why
hadnt he thought of the pistol he had
laid it out so that it would be at hand if
he needed it and the precaution had been
dugans opportunity when dugans eyes
hardened into a resolution to fire he would
drop his wife and leap at his enemy but
until then what the sight of little bryan
weber gave him an idea the boy stood
close to the door and a little behind dugan

  you forget the man with you said
ryan he will have a different tale
from yours with alices testimony the
two of them will convict you

man exclaimed dugan that poor
shrimp is no man hell do as i say swear
as i say or keep his mouth shut as i say
he knows that i will kill him if he doesnt
bryan weber wet his lips

  dont do it dugan he pleaded in a
voice which shook with his effort to keep it
steady these two people love one an-
other and are happy together you shant
do it you may threaten all you like but
i will tell on you as sure as i live if you
shoot this man

  you wont live you little squealer
say youll keep your mouth shut or ill
begin on you

  he turned the pistol toward the boy
but before he could point it ryan had
grasped the opportunity and hurled him-
self forward letting his wife slip to the
floor one of his clutching hands struck
the gun and knocked it to the deck as he
grappled with dugan weber leaped for
it as swiftly as a cat jumps for a mouse
and caught it up

  dugan had recovered from the first
shock of the others attack pulling ryans
hands from his throat he hurled him across
the deck and as the man stumbled to his
feet met him with a blow in the face which
sent him down beside his wife then he
turned to weber

  gimme that gun he ordered i
want to finish this job before this old wagon
blows up

  no said weber backing away leave
them alone or ill shoot

  shoot dared dugan still advancing
you havent got the nerve you poor
chicken-hearted mamas boy

  weber had his back to the wall

  keep off he begged i dont want
to shoot

  you bet you dont scoffed dugan
and made a flying leap at the boy

  he really thought that his cruel treat-
ment on the dixie had broken the younger
mans spirit

  weber fired twice he was quick and
handy with a revolver and led his division
in small-arm practise dugan plunged
blindly on struck the wall as weber
dodged and slumped down on deck
both shots had hit

  ryan was trying to get to his feet and
weber helped him

  i shot him he sobbed ill help
you carry your wife out

  together the two men picked up the
still unconscious woman and groped their
way down the smoke-filled passage as
they left the stateroom the door slammed
shut behind them and the latch caught

  the people on deck had thinned out
when weber and ryan reached the open
air hurry down the gangway advised
a smoke-blackened sailor theres a boat
just about to shove off

  there are two places in the boat and
weber had ryan go with his wife

  jump aboard kid advised the sena-
tors officer who was in charge you look
all in and you are light

  no said weber ill wait for my own
boat its on the way back now

  his mind was confused as to what he
ought to do

  the dixies boat that dugan had come in
had been filled with passengers and shoved
off to its own ship without waiting for the
two men absent and now it was coming
back with dick reasoner in charge weber
saw him as he refused to get in the senators
boat he felt that reasoner would under-
stand about dugan and he wanted his
help the boat shoved off and he stood
on the lower gangway and waited

  before the boat arrived other men
joined him on the platform

  shes going fast said one theres
only one bulkhead left between the ammu-
nition and the fire

  the captain is relieving the men and
fotting his papers together answered the
other theres two boats waiting along-
side the other gangway to take off the last
of the fire-hose men and the officers
above him weber could hear the roar
of the flames and it seemed as if the noise
grew momentarily louder he turned to
a shift into reverse



the men by him maybe it wasnt right
to wait for reasoner

  theres a man down in stateroom

twelve he blurted out hes hurt-

  twelve you say interrupted the man
why i wouldnt go back into twelve for
all the money in the world its next the
refrigerator plant and the ammonia pipes
are breaking not for me how do you
know theres somebody there yet

  weber did not answer for dick rea-
soners boat was alongside

  wheres dugan asked reasoner
things are looking mighty bad and we
want to get all our men off the passen-
gers are all accounted for and the rest of
it is up to the senators officers

  dugans hurt said weber taking the
easiest explanation to save time hes
in stateroom twelve and cant get out i
cant lift him by myself

  all right said reasoner cheerfully
jump out half a dozen of you and follow
weber

  not a man of the second division moved
they did not intend to undergo even a
slight risk for the sake of the hated dugan
reasoner had feared this his first thought
was that if the men of the division would
help dugan the man might feel grate-
ful enough to relax a little in his severity
but the feeling against him had gone too
deep the second did not care what
became of dugan

  come now persisted reasoner i
know how it is but this has to be done
i would go myself if i didnt think it would
do more good to have you go theres no
danger

  no danger exclaimed one of the men
on the gangway and just ready to step into
the boat number twelve is right at the
fire and word has just come that the
passage is filled with ammonia gas from
the ice-tanks the whole blooming ship is
likely to go fluey any minute

  out you go insisted reasoner

  he was sorry now that he had issued the
order but once given he felt that it must
be obeyed for the good of the division
his tone was sharp incisive the men re-
spected and liked him

  the two forward thwarts he directed
well do it for you said one of the men
as the four stepped on to the gangway
weber ran in front of them

  the more we hurry the safer it will be

he encouraged but those following did not
increase their pace

  well see how it looks muttered one
as weber plunged into the smoke they
hesitated ran after him for a few paces
and then slowed to a walk a man with
his head tucked into his arm and dragging
a hose bumped into them

  get out of here he directed cap-
tains orders take your places for aban-
don ship

  the four stopped weber had disap-
peared in the smoke down the passage

  whats it to me about dugan said
one im for taking the safety-first route
what do you say fellows we can tell
reasoner that we couldnt make it
wheres weber asked another i
hate to let the kid go on alone

  when he finds out hes alone hell come
on out said the first speaker we
couldnt find him now if we went on

  and so it was that the four men trailed
out into the clearer air on deck and at the
suggestion of the leader decided to wait a
few minutes for weber before they reported
to reasoner

cain dugan only lapsed into
complete unconsciousness for a few
minutes the shock of the two
steel-jacketed bullets the first one through
his upper body and the other through his
right arm and shoulder as he extended his
arm to catch the gun wore off quickly
and as he sat up on the deck he saw that
he was alone

  left me to burn he muttered but
ill fool em yet

  then he sought to pull himself to his feet
against the wall half-way up his unin-
jured arm gave way and he sank down

  the kid did shoot he said weakly
i thought i had him busted

  both of dugans wounds were bleeding
freely and he could feel himself losing
strength to reach the passage outside
and get through the smoke to the upper
deck he must lose no time with his unin-
jured hand he bound a part of his blouse
around the arm wadded the remainder
into a pack over his body wound and
started to crawl to the door twice on
the journey he stopped to rest but kept
on doggedly the smoke interfered with
his breathing and the injured arm dragged
uselessly making his progress difficult


adventure

  only by calling on the last reserve of his
great strength was he able to gain the door
for a full minute he lay panting before it
then inch by inch he raised himself caught
the knob and turned it the door did not
open the latch was a foot higher up
and dugan stupid with pain sank to the
floor before he realized the trouble

  the door opened inboard once more
dugan pulled himself up by the knob
then with infinitely greater effort he
gained the additional foot to the latch
even pulled it back and sought to open the
door but his inert body blocked him
the door came open an inch and no more
for one of dugans knees which he was
powerless to move was in the way a
blast of smoke and the stifling sting of
ammonia gas in his nostrils sent him
reeling backward and an awkward foot
slammed the door again

  flat on the deck dugan realized that
he could not open the door that he could
not raise himself to the knob again and
unless more strength came to him that he
could not even move this was a new
feeling to dugan always there had been
an abundance of strength to do with as he
wished to override all oppositions to
make others obey him and now he was
suddenly shorn of it all and left to die
miserably by a man he had sworn to kill
a woman whom he had taught to fear him
and a boy whose courage he despised
rage and humiliation burned in his soul
but as he lay helpless they cooled some-
what and left only bitterness and a clearer
vision of his life

 always he had been unhappy and
always he had dominated and ruled bru-
tally and now facing the end he knew
why no one came to get him out why little
weber driven into a corner had fired
why men loved dick reasoner and fled
from him knew the whole volume of hate
and that its answer in a crisis was failure
realized fully that love and hate are like
mysteries of the soul and that the more
a man gives of each the more he gets

  it cant be long now he groaned
grimly looking up at the closed door

  the smell of the gas came to him a little
stronger and he closed his eyes they
stung with the increasing smoke and it
eased the irritation but the noise of the
fire became louder and he had to open them
as he did so the door burst open and

bryan weber came in with head bent and
nose in his wet neckkerchief dugan
thought his eyes were tricking him until the
boy began shaking him

  helps coming he cried talk to me
dugan are you alive i came back as
soon as i could get help i tried to put the
bullets in your shoulders

  dugans good arm pulled the boy down
weber leaped back breaking the hold

  dont be afraid whispered dugan
i wont hurt you im pretty well messed
up one of the shots went low
reassured weber bent over him

  the others are coming he repeated
im afraid i cant carry you alone

  they waited a little and weber tried to
adjust the blouse more tightly around
dugans wounds

  theres not much time whispered
dugan cant you hear the fire cornin
and theres some kind of gas escapin

  i might drag you offered weber
the others may have missed the state-
room

 missed on purpose said dugan
harshly and at that you cant blame em
what made you come back he demanded
with a return of his old imperiousness

  i didnt want to acknowledged weber
but i shot you

  opening the door weber grasped dugan
by the shoulders and lifted him up dugan
cried out with pain

  take mv feet he directed i cant
stand it that way

  across the room and through the door-
way weber toiled with the dead weight
of the heavy man outside the full force
of the smoke and gas struck them weber
could not longer protect his nose for both
hands were necessary on dugans legs to
make headway after a few yards he went
to his knees choking for breath

  leave me here and get out ordered
dugan you cant make it kid

  his voice came jerkily from between shut
teeth the strain on his legs and the
bumping over the deck were almost un-
bearable

  weber took up his burden again he had
heard dugan but would not give up
every few feet he stopped and then went
on but the stops were longer and the feet
gained fewer

  quit i tell you said dugan at the
next stop youve done all you can and
a shift into reverse



theres no use of both of us going you
can make it without me

  webers answer was to take up dugans
feet and stumble on but this time he
moved barely a foot before he stopped
went to his knees and from his knees to his
stomach as he tried to struggle up again
letting go of his burden a strong hand
lifted him and shoved him down the
passage it was reasoner

  ill bring dugan he said get on
out and take your place in the boat
weber obeyed what dick reasoner
promised he would do

  when the men sent with weber reported
that the smoke had driven them out and
that weber had gone on alone reasoner
guessed what had happened for he knew
that the men of the second did not intend
to risk much to save dugan and that in the
smoke it would be difficult to find stateroom
twelve so he went to the rescue himself
and thought he was lucky when he found
weber and dugan in the passage as
weber went on at his orders he picked up
the heavy man in the approved first-aid
manner and bore him to comparative
safety on deck the officers of the senator
were rounding up the last members of the
fire-fighters and getting them into the
boats all felt that it was barely a ques-
tion of minutes till the magazines blew up
and that hurry was necessary

  see if your men are all out directed
the first officer we are abandoning

  a sailor helped reasoner down the gang-
way with his burden where he turned
dugan over to the hospital steward and
mustered his crew the four who had failed
to follow weber kept their eyes in the boat
and reasoner did not speak to them he
felt that when the whole story of webers
heroism came out they would be punished
enough

  with temporary bandages in place
dugan lay in the stern-sheets of the boat
reasoner had the tiller and weber too
weak to pull an oar sat aft also for half
the trip over dugan was silent then he
spoke to weber

  kid ive been all wrong about you
the rest of this second division is a bum
lot but youre a little man dont be
worryin about these punctures pills
striker tells me that ill make it o k
then he turned his eyes to reasoner
dictionary dick he said smiling

wanly ive made a lot of fun of you and
your queer notions but youve called the
turn ever time and ill have to hand it to
you your system has mine skinned a
dutch knot now im goin to save your
old bean a lot of worry as soon as i
spill this little yarn to the captain im
askin for transfer this second division
wouldnt ever forget and sometimes when
a mans in a pinch he needs friends on

another ship ill start different and see-

  i wouldnt talk so much dugan
interrupted the hospital steward it might
start the bleeding again

  dugan glared at him

  shut up yourself he said with a flare
of his old temper i stop when im
through then in a moment he asked
humbly enough could i speak one more
word to weber

  the steward nodded and weber bent
over to hear the low-spoken words

  tell alice for me that she can go on
and live her life in peace and that ill live
mine

  then the injured man settled back and
neither reasoner nor weber heard his
muttered comment- as they went alongside
the dixie and a dull roar behind them
heralded the last of the senator

  gone he said thats what almost
happened to me only ive been given
another chance

the dixie steamed at full speed
for the nearest port where the
passengers from the senator and
the wounded were landed slim higgins
and reasoner were at the rail as the boat
shoved off with dugan aboard

  well dick said slim whats the
good word

  reverse answered reasoner ive

he close of the revolutionary
war found many venturesome
spirits unwilling to return to the
humdrum of farm and mercantile
life early in  adventurers exploring
the southwest learned that mexicans in
santa fe were eager to pay two and three
dollars a yard for cheap cotton cloths
when this information had filtered back
east thrifty new englanders restless
southerners and bold frontiersmen were
quick to try their luck as merchants the
enormous profits taken by those who eluded
the wild-riding comanche fierce apache
blood-thirsty kiowa and numerous other
plains tribes resulted in the introduction
of pittsburgh-made wagons to the old santa
fe trail in 

  some three centuries before this coro-
nado cabeca de vaca and the survivors
of the ill-fated de soto expedition had
tramped the indian highway in rusty mail
lured on by legends of golden cities al-
though conquistador gave way for ameri-
can merchants the bait remained the same
mexican silver being substituted for gold
trapper trader missionary hunter soldier
and colonist in the order named began
fulfilling the destiny of the new continent
by blazing the way for steam-propelled
commerce

  the first wagons prairie schooners

had a capacity of a ton and a half each
being drawn by eight mules or as many
oxen they were a marvelous improvement
over the old pack-mule trains and quickened
trade to an amazing degree they were
soon doubled in capacity and required ten
or twelve mules or oxen to haul them and
as the vehicles increased in size and num-
bers so did the indians increase the ferocity
of their opposition till the trail was fringed
with raw scalps the red mans lust for
plunder was succeeded by the conviction
the influx of traders meant an end to the
buffalo

  the old trail was loyal to the red man
from missouri up the arkansas and beyond
the great bend as far as the cimarron
crossing it was a broad and obvious route
easily followed by the unsophisticated so
far as any topographical disadvantages
were concerned in the mad rush for mexi-
can silver many amateurs at the frontier
game accepted the first half of the trail
as an earnest for the whole and set forth
without proper guides

  once the cimarron crossing was reached
however the dusty ribbon of travel van-
ished and in its place were innumerable
buffalo trails radiating in all directions
from the river ordinarily the tenderfeet
and greenhorns sought to push on and thus
the trail frequently became a trap with red
red toll



toll accumulating in many savage tepees
nor were ignorant easterners the only
victims

   it is recorded that veteran trappers from
the rocky mountains egotistical in having
surmounted the obstacles of the upper
platte and yellowstone laughed at the
suggestion of danger and voted the monot
onous plains country a childs playground
often such men became lost beyond the
sparkling crossing

when silent leroux drifted
into fort larned to secure a job as
posthunter he made a favorable
impression by the respect he paid the
trail

   famed for years of travel through the in-
accessible portions of the west he was one
of a few of a vanished race who did not
treat the trail contemptuously he studied
it from all angles and never was deceived
by superficial appearances

  it might have been a strange fierce
animal found alive in one of his traps from
his cautious manner of approaching its
various phases

  from -mile creek to pawnee rock
to the cimarron crossing and thence to
the purgatory river country and bents
fort he examined it in detail by patience
and wariness he learned the trap before it
could close upon him

  he was typically american although the
veneer of civilization was long since sloughed
off he used to declare that he thought
in injun his nickname resulted from
no inherent trait of taciturnity when
young and callow he was one of the first
white men to penetrate the wonders of the
yellowstone region he was loquacious
enough in those days and zestfully in-
formed a trappers camp and hunters
bivouac about the mud volcanoes steaming
geysers boiling springs and petrified
forests

  it naturally followed he was ridiculed
unmercifully as he was not enough of a
philosopher to ignore such treatment and
wait contentedly for time to substantiate
his stories he changed into an exceed-
ingly close-mouthed man hence his so-
briquet

  as a hunter he was worthy to precede
kit carson prince of frontiersmen whom
fate already was grooming to tread these
same scenes

  the post commander early observed that
in addition to supplying sufficient meat
for the fort and passing trains he never
came in from the hunt without some
laconic correct report as to the move-
ments of the various tribes his value as
a scout soon overshadowed his work as a
hunter

  when texas charlie chief of scouts
leaped from his exhausted pony and re-
ported the finding of a brother scout killed
at ash creek the commander sent for
leroux

  as the old man slouched in the com-
mander hurriedly began

  texas charlie just arrived with bad
news silent two birds one of our crow
scouts has been wiped out on ash creek

those-kiowa you reported as moving

north of the republican fork to hunt
buffalo on the platte swung back

  it was customary to blame the kiowa
on general principles as they were the most
bloodthirsty and cruel of all the plains
indians in proportion to their numbers
they probably killed more whites than any
other one tribe

  silent thoughtfully twisted his wisp of
gray beard and frowned

  th kiowy was movin north o th
republican fork he slowly insisted
theyve patched up a peace with th
pawnee goin to hunt together them
two i reckon i know what i know if
they done fr two birds its th work
of a few young bucks keen to git their
feathers

  kiowas did it declared the com-
mander pulling something from his pocket
of course you couldnt know they would
swing back after crossing the fork but
swing back they did

  -it dont i know injuns broke

in silent with the independent scouts
disregard for rank reckon i knowed
injuns afore ye was born i say it could be
th work of only a handful o young braves
it wouldnt take th whole kiowy nation to
wipe out a crow scout

  the commander heard him patiently and
quietly replied-

  this tells the whole story

  he handed over a fragment of deerskin
cut from a hunting shirt it contained a
picture-writing done in black

  texas found it near where two birds
was killed added the commander
io

adventure

 silent stared incredulously at the picture
 message and beheld

  the old hunter was an expert in the sign-
language of the plains an indispensable aid
to interpreting the drawings made by in-
dians to convey a message there was no at-
tempt at artistic skill in the picture simply
an effort to announce a fact it was as
readily comprehensible to him as though
he had been an eye-witness of the tragedy

  two birds surprised at th crick an
didnt have time to run for it silent read
aloud th up n down line is th bank
behind which he hid keeps low an
sees a big number o kiowy comirr they
dont know hes there yet there was a
whalin big bunch of em as showed by th
hoof-tracks he dont know whether hell
git clear or be wiped out so he makes this
report hopin yell git it and larn th kiowy
is on th war-path in big numbers

  th two birds over his head dentifies
him but to make sure he stripes off his
har to show th crow custom o usin red-
clay to leave no doubt bout they bein
kiowy he makes th reglar picter fr that
tribe-a man wavin both hands foolish-
like

  and he mechanically gave the sign-
language designation of the kiowa by
raising his right hand level with his head
and revolving it to signify rattle brained
or crazy thus the gesture would be
interpreted by every plains indian from
mexico to canada

  the poor devil made it all plain enough
said the commander i want you and
texas to follow and learn their direction

  silent grunted wrathfully and com-
plained 

  i snum that gits me there aint
no doubt but what there was a big band
of em an yet i was sure they was off
fr a bufler hunt yep th whole dad
bilin of em must have swung back

  a blind man could see that tersely
remarked the commander after texas
has had a sleep you two must locate the
band they must be taught a lesson

too many of our scouts are being wiped
out the men are beginning to get ner-
vous

  th crow makes six inside a month
mused silent there was cayuse at th
cimarron big an little rusty at pawnee
forks near where this happened th breed
at th walnut an little irish at th rock
pawnee

  lean wolf is behind it fumed the
commander hes made his brags hell
wipe out all our scouts ill give two
hundred dollars for his scalp-if he has to be
taken dead

  i opine thats th way hed have to be
took muttered the old hunter his faded
gray eyes twinkling leastways some one
in his neighborhood would have to lose a
scalp if i ever met up with him ill be
ready when texas is

  he stayed long enough to bury two
birds then rode without a break here
its his nerves more than anything he
thinks every scout is being dogged but as
soonashecan sit a saddle hell go with you
silent returned to studying the picture
finally he asked

  why two of us wed cover more
ground by splittin up

  the commander laughed harshly saying
you havent any indian in your blood
texas grandmother was a cheyenne his
father was a white trader at bents hes
superstitious says he wont take a trail
alone again till after lean wolf has been
killed

  wal texas dont show his injun blood
any an a man dont have to be a breed to
feel that a-way drawled silent reckon
ill feel better fr havin a good man by my
side itll git on my nerves if any more
of us is killed ill be ridin out a bit be
back time charlies fit to climb a saddle

the post commander was in a rare
rage when the old hunter rode in
after an absence of nearly two days
but the high scout mortality forced him
to swallow his wrath he greeted

  now that youve finally returned i
suppose you will have to take a rest first
one man then another

  oh im all hunky mildly assured
silent thought id scared up some new
signs but they sort o petered out im
fits a fiddle wheres texas

  inside trying to drown his blue devils
 with whisky growled the commander
 youve stayed away too long to follow
 up the ash creek trail tried to get texas
 to go out alone yesterday but he refused
 now new work has turned up a big
 train is due to arrive at the cimarron
 crossing any day you two must get there
 and give warning that the kiowa are out in
 force

    if some one else can go i reckon texas
 an me can still pick up th ash creek trail
 penitently replied silent

    theres no one else to go-all the rest
 are out the train must be warned be-
 sides the band that killed two birds is
 probably down the trail by this time laying
 for the train

   well warn em all right assured
 silent ill take a snack with texas then
 well make th cimarron hell-flukin

    he found texas charlie seated at a rough
 table in the mess-room with a plate of
 untouched venison before him and the bottle

	half empty it was obvious the scouts
 nerves were demoralized silent saluted
 him with a cheerful grin and poured himself
 a drink texas slim and wiry and showing
 no trace of his cheyenne blood except in his
 small black eyes returned the amiable
 glance with a scowl and reached for the
 bottle a breed brought in a platter of
 meat which the hunter attacked hungrily

   as silent made no offer to talk texas
 finally demanded-

   scouting

   yep didnt find nothin reckon lean
 wolf an his braves is pretty far north by
 this time

   and i reckon youre very much mis-
 taken sullenly retorted texas i feel
 it in my bones hes near ready to strike
 ill be number seven the last with a
 faint shudder and a lunge for the bottle

    dod rot it angrily exclaimed silent
 cant i read signs dont i know a thing
 or two bout this game think ye know
 it all jest cause ye can talk book english
 i tell ye lean wolfs off to hunt with th
 pawnee he sent em a peace talk an a
 pipe moren a month ago i know that
 im not casting any reflections on your
 knowledge stiffly replied texas but
 lean wolfs band wiped out two birds
 the sixth of our scouts since the sending
 of the calumet to the pawnee the hunting
 trip to the platte is a ruse or as you say
 all in your eye 

  hold on a minute gasped silent
suspending his eating to gaze in admiration
at the slim and dapper figure jest
lemme corral some o that language is it
halter-broke

  flashing his white teeth in a shadow of a
smile texas apologized

  i cant help it i was educated in the
best schools in st louis from the age of
eight to twenty-one

  i swow ye didnt hear much injun in
st looey remarked silent

  texas face took on a deeper bronze
he never spoke of his ancestry

  i was bred to speak only english he
curtly replied if id gone east instead
of returning to this cursed country-and
yet i wouldnt have fitted in there well
im here-the bottles here well drink
to the trail

  dont ye git touchy texas at what an
ol man says reckon i talk lots o foolish-
ness every time i open my yap jest keep
on spillin good english i hanker to hear
it makes me think how i mighter larned
to talk it if id stayed where i belonged
in place o chasin out here to larn th
sign-language of a parcel o red beggars
not very complimentary to the noble
indian observed texas with a bitter
laugh six in a month looks as though
the cards were stacked against us and a
wagon train is due at cimarron crossing
and we must ride to give it warning-bah
theres no bite to this post whisky my
nerves still feel all unraveled rising he
pushed back the bottle in disgust ill be
in the corral

  silent bolted his food and soon followed
his brother scout to the horse-corral texas
was ready to mount the old man flung
his saddle and blanket roll on a vicious pony
and the two rode out on the trail

  after giving the word scout back on
both sides of the river and look for fresh
signs the commander called after them

  the men nodded and cantered away a
strange contrast in types texas was
immaculate in fresh buckskin his glossy
black hair worn long was carefully groomed
and accented the suggestion of dandyism
his weapons were inlaid with silver after
the mexican fashion and were the last word
in efficiency

  the old hunter was shaggy and di-
sheveled roughly clothed indifferently
armed and grotesquely mounted the ax
no

adventure

in his belt gave a touch of the primitive
a stranger to his history would never have
picked him as being the one of the two who
came from the east

  about as much alike as an apple and a
cactus commented the commander as he
watched them disappear down the trail
contradictions at every point and yet
the two best men ive got

h silent was inclined to conversa-
tion as he and his companion neared
the caches without having discov-
ered any new signs texas too seemed to
have discarded his nervous mood and spoke
frankly of his life in st louis

  even now i cant make it seem real
he morosely declared as they slowed down
at the caches i spent nearly all my life
there and yet it seems as though it was a
dream that i had never quit the trail
injun talk come natural to ye timidly
asked silent

  i absorbed it sighed texas i speak
english according to the book but i always
feel as though i was repeating something
i had memorized

  by jing reckon no one could talk it
so o k less he done a mighty big heap o
memrizin admiringly cried the hunter
reckon im too old to larn it as she
should be spoke

  it was my fathers orders that i should
have it hammered into me-it was

  wal i wish my fatherd fixed it so it
could a been hammered-hi i count a
coup and leaping from his pony silent
held aloft a small deerskin pouch

medicine bag curiously queried texas
silent took out several fragments of black
micaceous iron and made soft black marks
on the back of his wrinkled hand and
corrected

  war paint paint-bag

  if a kiowa dropped it it proves the
hunting trip to the platte was merely
a cover for a raid along the trail texas
forcefully declared

  bead work says kiowy slowly ad-
mitted the hunter after studying the pouch
closely represents sci-manzi th mes-
cal woman ive seen it on th sacred
gourd rattles used in th mescal ceremony
but never on a paint-bag afore

  wish i were as well versed in reading
their picture-writing as you are said
texas

  an i wish i could swap what i know
fr yer knack o tossin th english lingo
round funny world camp here or push
on to th crossing

  neither was the prompt reply ill
ride a half circle on this side of the river
while you do the same on the other side
well meet five miles below here at the big
patch of sage-brush we ought to hit the
trail of the war party that lost that pouch
good talk grunted silent i knew
yer nerve would come back once ye hit
th trail slong and wheeling his pony
he dashed through the shallow ford and sped
away in a wide detour

  although it lacked two hours of sunset
and he had no need for haste he used the
quirt liberally and maintained a sharp pace
traveling rapidly he passed the rendezvous
of sage-brush and galloped a mile before
turning back to the river then instead
of riding back to the brush he crossed the
stream and continued due north two
more miles were covered in this direction
then he dismounted and leading his pony
turned his back to the setting sun and
proceeded slowly his head bowed low his
eyes searching the ground

  descending a low ridge covered with
a coarse scrub grass he halted and dropped
on his hands and knees the light was
failing and in the hollow it was difficult to
pick up signs lowering his head like a
hound he cautiously crawled about his
pony keeping at his heels at last he
grunted contentedly and rapidly described
a circle when he had finished he sprang
to his feet displaying an agility not to be
expected of his years and vaulted into the
saddle this time he raced southwest
heading for the crossing

  the pony responded to the demands of his
master as though his very ugliness were
converted into fresh speed and endurance
it lacked an hour of midnight when the
hunter splashed into the crossing and as-
cended the opposite bank

  near the river glowed smoldering camp-
fires his noisy crossing had attracted
attention and as he became a silhouette
against the sky-line a sharp voice called out
red or white quick or ill fire
govment scout from fort lamed in a
hell-of-a-hustle bawled back the hunter
what trains this

  colonel vrains who are you ad-
vance or ill fire


red toll

hi

  silent could hear men crawling from
beneath the prairie schooners their rifles
rattling against the wheels but he had
no time to waste in visiting

  im the govment scout from lamed
he repeated ive a long ride afore me
im sent to warn ye that yell be jumped
by a small band o kiowy at sunrise
theres bout thirty of em corral yer
wagons an double yer guard how many
rifles have ye

   nough to handle any thirty reds
was the suspicious reply just ride for-
ward or ill plug ye

  yell be jumped at sunrise or a leetle
before make yer own medicine

  with that he turned and dashed into the
stream and rode like mad along the south
side of the arkansas

the east was beginning to redden
when he leaped from his blown pony
at the cover of sage-brush texas
quickly emerged crying

 where have you been i thought
theyd got you

  struck signs of a war-party an rode on
to th crossin to warn th train its
colonel vrains outfit wearily replied
silent as he turned his pony loose and
entered the brush

  of all the fool moves gritted texas
why didnt you come back here to meet
me then both of us could have gone
and stayed to help the train if it came to a
fight

  reckon i got nervous then agin it
was some ride from here didnt even
know as id find ye here thought ye
might a struck th same signs an follerd
em up

  ive sweat blood waiting here alone
growled texas believed youd been
wiped out then decided it would be my
turn before morning

  wal its done an th trains warned
i didnt go very near as i was keen to git
back feller offered to shoot me fr my
pains-cussed tenderfeet let loose to raise
cain on th trail

  texas remained standing nervously
twisting his black mustache his eyes
turned toward the crossing silent
dropped to the ground with a grunt of
content and examined his long rifle

  you need sleep ill stand guard
snapped texas over his shoulder

  no moren ye do reminded silent
yeve been awake all night a-worryin
lawdy wish i knowed english like what
ye do id quit this life an go back to
th states an be a genlman

  texas laughed harshly

  youd need something besides book
english to be accepted as a gentleman
he bitterly informed youd need money
lots of it youd be a gentleman as long
as it lasted it wouldnt make any differ-
ence how you got it so long as you had it-
there are no poor gentlemen

  shucks ye dont say did ye ever
try it out texas

  still facing the west the scout monot-
onously replied

  so long as my father lived i had plenty
of money i was invited to places made
much of rich traders son when he
died the money stopped very few invi-
tations then again-

  yep then agin-softly prompted
silent

  it was noised about i was neither white
nor red-i had no folks gritted the scout

  what odds could that make puzzled
silent

  what odds why you doddering-i
forgot youve been lost out here all your
life the plains are kinder than the east
in that respect it makes this difference
old man if you wish to marry people
suddenly get very curious about your
history and insist on knowing all about
your parents-i learned my lesson once
and i came out here

  ye know th east bettern i do wist-
fully admitted silent an come to think
of it i reckon i couldnt stand bein shet
up in a wooden house still theres times
when i git mighty sick o bufler an injuns
-meanin fightin injuns so ye jumped
back to th trail an went right to scoutin
eh

  ive been a government scout for some
time big train

  not very-all tenderfeet

   then if you cant sleep well ride to the
crossing our guns will be needel
and the scout whistled shrilly to his pohy

  be ye crazy protested silent my
cayuse is dead beat aint they got their
warnin its up to them-an we never
could make it in time th suns due in
a few minutes wed only run into th
injuns an be scalped


adventure

  texas hesitated complaining-

  but to remain here when our help is

needed-

  hark broke in silent lifting his hand
hear that guns by th etarnal
theyve jumped it already hoarsely
cried the scout striding bade and forth in
much agitation

  a splutter of rifle fire coming faintly
down the river indicated the beginning of
a battle silents face twisted with anxiety
the rifle fire was a code he could skilfully
interpret the scattered shots evidenced
a surprise attack successfully carried out
the same thought was in texas mind
for he muttered-

  no backbone in that shooting
hooray yelled the hunter drawing
his ax and brandishing it exultingly
but theres backbone in that this as
the rifle fire suddenly increased in volume
and became marked with well-defined
regularity that aint no injun shootin
th red devils thought theyd worked a
game an theyre hooked hear em

i must a been mistook bout their bein
tenderfeet theres some ol hands in
that train-firin in squads sos not to
unload all their guns at th same time
our help may be needed come along
cried the scout making for his pony

  silent held him back by clutching his
fringed sleeve

  be ye crazy he demanded itll be
all over afore we can make it my ponys
winded th trains either beat em off an
will be rollin along here in a few hours or
else its wiped out no matter whos
won wed be sure to run into th injuns
an lose our har

  the logic of this could not be gainsaid
texas returned to the little opening in
the heart of the brush mumbling

  it sounds cold-blooded but its common
sense it will be finished before we can
make it the fire seems to be dropping
both pricked their ears only occa-
sional shots were being fired either the
indians were retreating or finishing off the
wounded silents withered face became
distorted with fear then all doubt was re-
moved when there came a staccato volley
waving his ax the old hunter yelled

  that tells th whole story th -

beggars got a bellyful an are runnin away
theyre beat so bad th train aint skeered to
let off all their guns at once

  theyre whipped assented texas
dropping to the ground but we ought
to have made a try for it go to sleeps
ill watch till the train comes up

  silent stretched his arms in a yawn and
rose and procured his blanket roll sur-
rendering-

  reckon i will snooze a bit now th
citements over feel sort o peaked
reseating himself he fumbled with a thong
of rawhide tied round his blanket then
paused to remark say texas dye know
that picter-writin ye found up ash crick
way worried me a heap made me think
i was jest a dad blamed ol fool

  texas jerked up his head in surprise and
demanded-

  how so

  wal it showed two birds had plenty
o time to make his writin afore th injuns
jumped him he made it sos to give th
fort warnin bout th kiowy if he should
be wiped out

  of course

  but if he had time to do that whyn
sin didnt he make a run fr it

  he was on the east side of the creek
they were between him and the fort
probably his pony was winded

  thats probly it drowsily agreed
silent unfastening the second thong and
removing his belt and placing his ax upon
it he must a been a mighty smart injun
smartern id reckoned on it aint in
injun natur to figger things out that way
it would a been more natural if hed give
a war-whoop once he saw he was cornered
start singin his death-song an pitch into
them but he took time to make a writin
like a white man would do who knew he
was done fr an wanted to send a last word
to th world i kicked him once fr stealin
my whisky-wish i hadnt he want no
artist but he was strong fr gittin in th
facts

  indian picture-writing shows no knowl-
edge of perspective proportion is never
considered impatiently reminded texas
better turn in or the train will be here
before you can get any rest

  im goin to-im dead tired pro-
portion wal i reckon not say dye
notice how he made his head biggern th
whole flock o hoss-tracks he sure showed
th injun conceit when he come to draw
hisself th two birds was nough but he
even took time to stripe off his long har
red toll

ii

like th sioux do when they want to mean a
crow

  i see nothing in that to make you feel
worried snapped texas tearing up little
tufts of grass between his crossed legs
better turn in

  jest what im goin to do-ill sleep like
a top too ye see it fussed me up because
th picter showed there was a heap o
hossmen he jest wanted to hammer that
fact home

 he saw them he knew how many he
saw

  an theres th nub what fussed me
fr jest afore he was wiped out i scouted
that region some keerful an larned lean
wolf an th bulk of his men was off to
jin th pawnee in a big bufler hunt
thats what i reported back to th fort
th commander must think im an ol
fool

  any scout is apt to read signs wrong at
times mumbled texas

  id overlook it in another but in my
own case it hurt my feelins said silent
beginning to open the blanket why i
even was so upsot at my mistake i jest
took a scout up th crick arter ye arrived
with th picter

 you did

  the query shot out like a bullet the
scout drawing his heels beneath him as
though to rise his gaze narrowing

  with a raucous laugh silent gathered
his feet under him and continued-
thats what i done-an i couldnt
find nary a sign o th kiowy what two
birds marked down in his picter

  so but its only a guess that he made
the drawing i picked it up some distance
from where i found him it may have
belonged to a kiowa who had it to use when
he made up his winter count calendar of
tribal events

  silent shook his head dissenting
scurcely possible seein as how it
pictered two birds either he made it
or th injuns what wiped him out made
it but if injuns done it th picter would
show him killed no th kiowy couldnt
a made it an yet it was made with th
same kind o paint that i found in th pouch
at th caches-curous

  who then but two birds could have
made it hoarsely demanded texas

  lawd bless ye i dont know less it
was some one who hated white folks an



their govment scouts because he hisself
was neither white nor red retorted silent
as he smoothed out the blanket

  with a sharp intake of breath texas
leaned forward and glared at the blanket
for nearly a minute the two sat rigid and
silent then the scout whispered-

  where did you get that

  from th body i dug up gritted silent
balancing on the balls of his feet as he met
and returned the ferocious gaze two
trails led to th east bank o th ash only
one quit it two birds was killed in his
sleep murdered inside his blanket by some
one he trusted

  he paused and pointed at the tell-tale
hole made by the mortal knife-blow then
he loudly cried

  ye-renegade neither white nor red

ye done fr him jest as ye done fr th scouts
at th cimarron crossing at th rock at
pawnee forks at th walnut an as yed
planned to do fr me ye made believe
ye didnt dare take th trail alone along o
fearin lean wolf yer book english made
ye cute but not cute nough to fool th ol
man who knows more injun than ye do
i knew somethin was wrong th minute
i see that picter-writin

  ye made a mistake when ye put in so
many bosses ive been watchin ye all th
time i follered ye yesterday i found
th signs where ye met a small band o
kiowy after quittin me i found where
yer trail jined theirs ye had a pow-wow
with em an rigged it fr em to jump th

train-

  with an animal shriek of rage the lithe

apive-part story  part 
 viuiaro tatterson wlilfe

author of paradise bend longhorns etc

the first part of the story briefly retold in story form

tn the longhorn country when one gentleman

  bestows baneful glances upon another it be-
hooves the innocent bystander to be vigilant

  so when johnny ramsay of the cross-in-a-box
observed a red-headed individual glance sourly in
through the door of the happy heart saloon at a
brown-bearded stranger drinking at the bar he sat
upright a few minutes later the red-head entered
and sat in at a game of poker

  one of the players being forced to retire the red-
head invited brownbeard to take the empty place
brownbeard would rather not red-head insisted
and insinuated brownbeard strode to the table and
sat down

  the deal passed around the table and came to
brownbeard as he flipped the first card to the
red-head the latters gun flashed while he sent the
cards flying brownbeard sank in a heap

  he tried to skin us the-tinhorn didya see

him deal from the bottom of the deck exclaimed
the red-head indignantly

  no one had-but no one could prove otherwise
slim berdan the town marshal settled the case
quickly

  stranger said he yuh got twenty minutes to
pull yore freight out o farewell or well hang yuh
some

  before the body was buried jake rule sheriff of
fort creek county arrived and identified the dead
man as mat neville a wells-fargo detective a man
who had never been known to cheat in his life

  reak and jangle hoofbeat and bump the
through stage from paradise bend to marys-
ville pulled in with the guard killed and whisky
jim the driver creased on the head

  road-agents again he explained simply this
was the tenth time he had been stopped

  an hour later bill stahl sheriff of sunset county
arrived and posted notices to the effect that the
territory would pay one thousand dollars apiece
for the delivery dead or alive of the bandits who
were operating in simset county the wells-
fargo company duplicated the offer

  at sheriff rules home johnny interviewed both
rule and sheriff stahl but learned nothing more of
the road-agents

  yeah she sounds a heap interestin i guess
ill just go after that reward he concluded

  then entered smilingly racey dawson and tele-
scope laguerre

  we heard yuh through the window they an-
nounced an we decided to go with yuh so we can
sort o look after yuh an horn in on the two thou-
sand wheels a bandit

  so they laid their plans the sheriffs were to
tell nothing of the scheme to any one but just to
greet the three casually as before two of the trio
were to secure jobs as stray men probably from
scotty mackenzie of the flying-m the third
was to work at the stage depot already they were
counting the reward-money

  two days later the three met again and johnny
ramsay look the road to paradise bend the others
to follow at intervals

  as he was picking his way along a difficult trail
three mornings later three shots cracked ahead of
him where the trail turned into a grove of cotton-
woods he found their cause-two dead men in a
buckboard and a dead horse in the distance three
riders were rapidly fording a stream johnny aimed
and fired but the horses two chestnuts and a black-
tail dun were already out of range

  the murdered men he found had been robbed
just as johnny discovered the place from which
they had been ambushed hoofbeats sounded on the


hidden

road he drew into the bushes when the care-
fully dressed rider drew up johnny stepped from
his place of concealment together they examined
the bodies then the stranger suggested

we might as well go back to the bend together
theyve got too much of a start to do anything

howdja know im goin to the bend anyhow
questioned johnny

this is how came the answer and he stared
into the twin-barrels of the strangers derringer

johnny disarmed riding in front the derringer
in the rear they rode to paradise bend

jhen the town was reached the captor an-
nounced he had caught a road-agent red-
handed

ill getcha my rope yelled a citizen and the
crowd pressed forward

 while johnny was trying to yell his explanations
 soapy ragsdale and jim mace two old friends of
 his edged their way forward and took their places
 by his side

i got my finger on the trigger ragsdale an-
nounced pointing his carbine i dont like this

here bellerin for ropes an i dont give a-who

 knows it

 the crowd remained at a respectful distance

then arrived the marshal who ordered a trial and
picked dave dusenburys store as the court-room

constituting himself judge the marshal chose
twelve jurors although he declared a jury aint
really necessary and proceeded to the trial

trails	

  while every window of the store was jammed with
people harry slay the man who had brought
johnny into town told his story twisting fact and
argument so cunningly that the two appeared as one

  but the light came to johnny by working
cartridges through his rifle he proved that if he had
fired the shots the shell cases must be nicked for
all which passed through his gun came out that way
next he declared that the empty shells if they had
been thrown out would be found in the ambush-
without a nick one nicked shell would be where
he had thrown it after shooting at the horsemen

  in conclusion he declared that if the bullets were
dug out of the wounds they would be found to be
s while his were -s

  but the marshal and jury did not want to lose
time investigating a murmur arose the mar-
shal coughed fingered his six-shooter and said

  gents yall heard what harry slay said yall
heard what this feller said what do you say

  yes gents what do you say drawled a voice
from the doorway

  scotty mackenzie and eight of the flying-m
riders pressed in and stood by johnnys side

  gents yuh was goin to say somethin what
was it reminded scotty

  they was a-goin to adjourn over to yaller
medicine crick to look at some evidence put in
the marshal

  oh yeah said scotty guess well trail along
yuh see i was standin in that doorway a good ten
minutes before anybody saw me

chapter vii

scotty mackenzie

eres a spent shellp cried one
of scottys outfit a bristle-
haired young man named swing
tunstall

he handed the shell to scotty and the
latter held it up for the marshal to see

yuhll notice swing found her on the
buckboard side o that cottonwood about
ten feet off the road scotty pronounced
in a dry tone an heres johnnys twin
scratches down the side les go look for
the heel-marks

the presence of the heel-marks in the
soft ground having been verified twenty
men including the jurors scotty and the
marshal climbed the steep slope to where
the two boulders snuggled between their
guardian pines

behind the boulders they found three
spent shells-two -s and one -

not scratched a-bit none of em

observed scotty dug that bullet out o
homan yet cal he called to an earnest
seeker after light on the trail below

  in a minute replied cal my knife
done touched her all right but shes kind
o behind a bone shes a-comin

  she came and was duly examined by the
multitude

  - bullet was scottys remark
so johnny didnt fire that cartridge an
he didnt fire them two unscratched -s
neither i guess that pretty near settles
the cat-hop

  shore it does the marshal affirmed
with forced heartiness i guess the

jurys satisfied gents yore-

  but i aint satisfied-yet interrupted
scotty smoothly yuh forget johnny
seen three jiggers cross the creek well
slide down and look at the tracks an
while were about it we might just as well find
out where they tied their hosses while they
was bushwhackin old man an bill all

them lil things help like- yuh know

he added plaintively

  no one was deceived by his tone all
accompanied him without demur after
quartering the ground for fifteen minutes
scotty and his followers halted in a pocket
among the pines

  heres where they tied their hosses
ii

adventure

announced scotty three hosses an by
the looks o the ground they was standin
here a while les go down to the creek
they traced the tracks from the pocket
to the creek up the opposite bank and
out across the flats

  i guess this is most enough said
scotty halting a hundred yards from the
water

  she was enough before the hard-

featured tom assured him - i guess

we know when everythins all right

  i guess-maybe-yuh do was scottys
drawling indorsement

  but scotty was not looking at tom
the hard blue stare was directed straight
into the pale eyes of harry slay the latter
promptly smiled in a most engaging fashion

  this is fine he declared without hesi-
tation i am delighted that matters have
turned out as they have and that your
friend gets a scotch verdict-the benefit
of the doubt in other words

  benefit of the doubt thus scotty
softly almost tenderly

  a slip of the tongue beamed slay
with a flash of white teeth i should
have said unquestionably cleared of the
charge against him 

  yeah yuh should have said scotty
funny how folks dont always think o
the right thing to say

  surely is agreed the good-humored
slay have a cigar

  cigarets kind o suit my health better
parried scotty fishing out the makings

  better stick to em then advised slay
and began to walk away from there

  swing tunstall looked at his friend jack
mccall and rubbed a solemn chin jack
thrust his tongue into his cheek later
in the bunk-house they would recount
with delight how their employer ran a
blazer on harry slay and forced that plump
person to say what he had not intended
to say

  scotty gave no evidence that he realized
what he had done mildly he asked tun-
stall for a match lit his cigaret and plodded
slowly back to the buckboard with the
others

  wheres harry queried a citizen
named carey

  started back replied cal mason busy
at the buckboard pass the rope under
his arms tug an ill tie em to the back
of the seat

  naw objected tug put em both on
the floor spose their feet do hang over-
whats the difference

  they aint room i tell yuh avowed
cal heatedly theys only room for bill
homan on the floor old mans gotta sit
alongside o yuh aw whatcha beefin
about-he aint bleedin even a lil bit
lemme drive then i can drive yore hoss
bettern you anyhow cal added with
consummate tact

  tug drove

  on the ride back to the bend johnny
contrived to maneuver scotty to the tail
of the cavalcade

  gotta fix my cinches johnny an-
nounced suddenly and catching scottys
eye motioned rearward with his head

the quick-witted scotty halted
his horse as johnny slid to the
ground when johnny swung up
the others were three hundred yards ahead
scotty grinned at johnny and johnny
grinned at scotty they liked dach other
very well these two johnny knew better
than to thank scotty for coming to his res-
cue he merely mentioned that scotty
had picked a good day on which to ride to
town scotty guessed that this was the
truth and the subject was closed

tory aint texas

the way from st paul too why say
he even picks flowers out in the woods for her
had slay been in the habit of construct-
ing bouquets of rattlesnakes scottys tone
could not have expressed more horrified
disgust johnny was disgusted too but
in a different way

he owns the broken dollar sloon-
runs six games in there i thought yuh

for them kind o fireworks its yore
play 

  seein as nobody else wants to pick up
a hand johnny observed with sarcasm
i guess maybe it is

  scotty said nothing having sown the
seed he was content to await the harvest

  goin out tonight inquired johnny
when the scattered lights of paradise bend
winked at them across the night

  guess not said scotty too late
well go tomorrow

  ill be out later-with telescope ob-
served johnny not much use goin out
till after he comes besides we gotta look
at them tracks

  shore concurred scotty grinning into
the darkness theys all kinds o reasons
for yuh to stay in the bend he added
under his breath

  whatcha say johnny questioned sus-
piciously

  talkin to the hoss

from the windows and doorways
of store saloon and dance hall
flaring fans of yellow light lay across
the sidewalks and stretched with diminish-
ing intensity into the dust of the street
in the how come you so dance hall two
fiddlers were dispensing the heartsome
strains of the arkansas traveler and
heavy boots and light slippers were scuffling
and sliding over the floor an intoxicated
gentleman was roaring the days of forty-
nine in the three card and from the
jacks up came the merry cries of the bar-
tender and the proprietor as they strove
to eject an unwelcome customer

good lil town was scottys comment
all o that said johnny watching with
admiring interest the unwelcome customer
issue from the jacks up skitter across the
hidden trails



sidewalk and strike the street on the back
of his neck

  lookit lookit he urged delightedly
prodding scotty

  yeah thats lotta wallace said
scotty who was looking in the opposite
direction kind o fancy aint she

  huh who puzzled johnny think-
ing of the unwelcome customer

  shell strike the light again in a shake
scotty continued to stare across the street
and johnny following with his eyes got the
range in time to see a woman step into the
light from the doorway of the golden rule
-a woman of dark and brilliant beauty
whose alluring black gown revealed and
emphasized the charm of throat and
shoulders shoulders that should have been
covered by the white shawl she trailed over
a bare and perfect forearm

  johnny watched the slim figure shuttling
through the light and darkness of the street
till it disappeared within the entrance of
the broken dollar

  lookout was his question

  sometimes scotty told him but
mostly she spins the wheel shes slays
sister mis lotta wallace an a widow-
she says yuh cant tell it might be true
me i always like to look at her she
makes me think o when i was a barfoot
kid back east in macpherson an the cir-
cus come to town an for the first time in
my life i seen a leopard yessir its shore
amazin how mis wallace reminds me o
that leopard

  did she come here with slay

  yep-all the way from cheecawgo-
if yuh believe what they say me per-
sonal i got a idea theyre a long time from
lake michigan-a long long time they
was nothin tenderfooty about either of em
when they come yessir a gent dont
learn to pull a gun like slay can pull her
back east it aint a city trick an
that lotta gal was born on a boss

  johnny i seen her ride dan smiths
pitcher one day which that wall-eyed
cayuse gave her all he knowed from sun-
fishin to changin ends an djuh think she
pulled leather nary a pull she stuck
to him like grim death to a dead nigger an
loped him through town at the finish like
nothin had happened but just the same
he added hastily she reminds me o that
leopard

  yeah said johnny thinking of some-

thing else an so slays been here about
two years huh was it before or after he
come that they had the first hold-up

  aw- yore ropin at the wrong cow

johnny declared scotty i dont like
harry a-tall but ill say he aint in them

tin this last one hes been here in town

once an i took the trouble to find out
whoever they are harry slay aint one of
em les cross over johnny yore stay-
in at the hotel with me tonight

chapter viii

dorothy burr

dorothy burr was lining pie-pans
when johnny ramsay stuck his head
through the kitchen doorway

  youre a nice one was her response to
his greeting here i waited up half the
night expecting youd come and tell me
everything was all right and you didnt
and i had to hear it all from mis mace
this morning lot of consideration you
have for your friends i must say

  she stared at him with resentful eyes
but maam he protested reddening
slightly at her naive announcement it
was late when we rode in-almost mid-
night

   i sat up till one

  if id only knowed but not knowin
i done what i thought was best i just
brought yore hoss back hes in the cor-
ral now im shore obliged to yuh for
lendin him to me an for takin care o
mine for me which that lil red hoss was
shore dead-beat

  dead-beat she smiled whimsically at
the recollection i guess he was the
poor chap tried to lie down twice between
main street and here hes all right now
he was trying to kick twinkles when i
watered them this morning

  dorothy pushed back a falling lock of
brown hair with a floury hand and reached
for the bowl of filling she had a dab of
flour on the bridge of her pretty nose her
waist was open at the neck and her rolled-
up sleeves made manifest the dimples in
her attractive elbows she looked a very
delectable young person as she sat there
her smooth cheeks pink with the heat of the
kitchen


adventure

  johnny sat down on the door-sill braced
his toes against the jamb and built him-
self the inevitable cigaret he stared lazily
across his humped knees at the lady he
did not find her in the least hard to look
at she was handsomer than she used to
be he told himself no two ways about
it she certainly filled a fellows eye

  whats that she asked raising dark
eyes to his

  i-i didnt say nothin denied johnny
going red to the ears she-shes a nice
day

  i beg your pardon i thought you
said something about eyes

  who me nun-no maam

  all right indifferently

  come to think of it maybe now i did
say somethin about eyes he observed
imbued with sudden daring i was just
thinkin how yore eyes are a plumb dark
brown almost black an yore eyebrows the
same an yore hair is a lil lighter an yet
they all kind o match

  she gazed at him with parted lips the
aforesaid almost black eyebrows inquiringly
arched then she smiled adorably and
spooned up some more filling

  the wonders of nature she twinkled
at him keep your eyes open and youll
learn something new every day you
never used to be so observant

  my eyesights gettin better was his
dry comment

  i know she said leveling the spoon at
him youve been reading novels youre
getting romantic you stop it do you hear
eyebrows and eyes and hair indeed

  she sniffed quite audibly

  but they look so kind o - kind o
pretty he protested i was just tellin
yuh why maam even that smear o
flour on yore nose looks nice

  never mind about my nose said she
rubbing the feature in question vigorously
with the corner of her apron of course
i know i have a certain element of charm
as it were my perfectly good mirror tells
me that but it isnt at all necessary for
you to tell me about i dont like it and
i wont have it

  wont yuh

  no

  why

  darn the man i declare when it
comes to fool questions youre worse than
a brat what you need is a little exercise

and what i need is some fresh water the
pails in that corner do you think you
can find the well without being led to it
by the hand

  i know i cant he declared promptly
besides yuh need some fresh air this
kitchens kind o hot cmon out

  after get a move on with that water
and stop your nonsense

  when johnny had gone dorothy sat
looking through the open window at the
green and distant government hills there
was a tender little smile on her lips at
the sound of his returning step she went
on with her pie-making

  wheres yore ma he asked suddenly
bethinking himself of mrs burr as he set
the full pail in the corner

  shes over at mis ackers on jack
creek

  i thought you said yuh done sent sammy
barnes for her said he recollecting what
dorothy had told the marshal the previous
afternoon

  dorothy giggled

  i sort of told a fib she confessed i
didnt really send for ma you see i knew
scotty and some of his boys would be
fencing in that quicksand at wagon slue
on the dogsoldier yesterday so i sent
sammy for scotty instead but i thought
dan smith and the rest of that mob had
better keep right on believing as long as
possible that they had nearly two hours
in which to try you and-and-instead of
the thirty minutes or so necessary for the
ride to wagon slue and back

  i know what yore an-an  means
said he soberly they was shore out to
hang me theyd a done it if it hadnt
been for you

  nonsense she exclaimed sliding the
pies into the oven and kicking the door
shut jim mace and soapy were there
i didnt really do anything

  im thinkin different he told her
earnestly took a step toward her and
paused overcome by sudden shyness
cue-call me johnny will yuh
dorothy deliberately turned her back on
him and crossed the room to the tiny mir-
ror hanging beside the china-closet here
she busied herself in pulling and patting
her coiffure into shape head cocked on
one side she surveyed the effect

  johnny scraped an uncomfortable foot
he thought he had made her angry and
hidden trails



mentally called himself a fool yet at the
time his request seemed a natural one to
make

dorothy turned still without
looking at him walked to the
table reached for a can of peas and
the can-opener and proceeded to travel
round the top of the can when the peas
had been neatly slid into a double-boiler
and the can thrown out the lady fixed
johnny with a cool and tantalizing eye
the young man was now wishing himself
elsewhere but to retire gracefully was
beyond his powers he was perspiring a
little dorothy smiled the peculiar smile
of the entomologist about to impale a rare
insect on a large pin

  how long have you known me she
inquired coldly

  three-three years stuttered johnny
i think not she contradicted you
havent seen me for at least two years
but the year before i seen quite a lot
of yuh defended johnny

  three times enumerated she with in-
creasing chilliness of demeanor

  it was moren that he insisted

  it was not three times exactly-no
more no less and i dont believe you
said a dozen words to me during any of the
three times

  oh maam yore mistaken johnnys
tone was piteously horror-stricken

  her lips twitched

  i am not mistaken she insisted i
am never mistaken-in anything i may do
under the circumstances having known me
such a short time and all that you know
dont you really think its the least bit
nervy to ask permission to call me by my
first name

  itd be worse if i called yuh that with-
out askin yuh said he matter-of-factly

  answer my question the dark eyes
held him

  y-yes maam o course it would he
affirmed hastily im sorry i didnt
mean-i guess ill go now

  why not wait a moment i havent
quite finished

  youve made it moren plain maam
nevertheless johnny halted on his way
to the door

she answered solemnly then promptly
dazzled him with a radiant smile reach
me down a can of tomatoes from the top
shelf will you-johnny

  there was more than joy in his grin as
he brought her the tomatoes

  a whole can o tomatters the disap-
proving voice of scotty mackenzie ex-
claimed from the doorway an a whole
can o peas an a skillet full o hashed
hogans an ham i aint namin no names
but theys such a thing as havin a healthy
appetite an theys such a thing as bein

perfectly dorothy assured him youre
merely shedding sunshine in your own sweet
way johnny while youre setting a place
for yourself at the table set another for the
old gentleman with the whiskers

  i didnt know i was a-goin to stay
johnny strove to inject the correct degree
of surprise into his tone

at the two of them straddled a chair and
sailed his hat into a far corner

  yeah yore shore as nice-lookin as a
lil red wagon with that color an all he
remarked after a space devoted to the
rolling of a cigaret

  you leave my color alone dorothy
told him forking over the sizzling ham

scotty tranquilly yuh know i never
eat nothin here i dont dast if i did

disdainful dorothy

  thats all right i dont mind be
as polite as yuh like johnny while dorthy

youn me traipse over to the corral i
wanna show yuh somethin on my saddle
at that particular moment a saddle was
not johnnys idea of something to look at

thy he accompanied scotty in silence

as they approached the burr corral

individjul in ten days ride look darlin

  scotty mackenzie fished something from
the staple pocket on his cantle and held it
toward johnny the latter took it won-
deringly it had- once been a cheap
silver watch now it was smashed beyond
all hope of repair it lay in johnnys palm
a battered glassless case sprouting a tangle
of springs and cogwheels

  pretty lil thing commented scotty
whats it for asked the puzzled
johnny

it aint to keep time but i thought
maybe it might come in handy for yuh i
found it this mornin right at the edge o
that quicksand im fencin in at wagon slue

  johnny obeyed on the back of the case

watch in the quicksand what else

  i guess yore right concurred johnny

agents live in town or near it

chapter ix

the other woman

johnny spent the afternoon with the
hospitable dorothy the lady as she
tidily darned her fathers socks did not find
johnny an inspiring companion she was
neither accustomed to silence nor mono-
syllabic replies she did not realize that
her visitor was deep in a mathematical prob-
lem and making an exceedingly boggy ford
of it one and one will simply not make
four no matter how many times you add or
multiply them together but johnny was
a persistent soul he kept right on juggling
bill homans watch and his own suspi-
cions till supper-time arrived and brought
not the remotest hint of a satisfactory
answer whereupon johnny put on his
hat and departed hotelward-to see a man

  yeah hes a great friend o mine he
told dorothy id like to stay to supper
honest i would but i got my own sinful
pride an moochin one meal a day off a
lady is my limit gby

  dorothy was left sputtering indignantly
after supper and a most indifferent meal
it was in comparison with his dinner he
went over to ragsdales store and spent a
tobacco-laden hour gossiping with soapy
jim mace came in and the hour lengthened
to two and darkness fell and it was night

  about ten oclock johnny stood up on his
feet and yawned and stretched his long arms
and legs till they cracked

  i guess ill kind o take a look round
town he observed

  yeah said jim mace his eye lighting
is that a saloon across the street or do my
eyes deceive me

  you buster bawled ragsdale cmin
here an take the store i gotta go out on a
lil business

  johnnys chief wish at that moment was
to be about his own business but his two
friends did not seek to further that wish
their earnest desire was to make it a large
evening to which end they hung johnny

and themselves over the bar of the three
card and invited all and sundry to join
them

  johnny took a small part of one drink
after which by the exercise of some strategy
and all his natural agility he contrived to
escape through a rear window

  standing well back and to one side of the
splayed light from the window johnny
heard soapy and jim call on him by name
and finally leave hurriedly by the front door

  let em hunt he grinned me i got
business

  he turned and looked along the irregular
line of rear elevations there was the
golden rule-those three small glowing
windows beyond it the houses were dark
-private residences beyond these again
was a dim light-the stage station the
dark bulk adjoining the stage station was he
knew the rear of the broken dollar saloon
and gambling-joint there were six win-
dows and a doorway in the rear wall of the
broken dollars back room but all were
dark

  slays shore economical o light in that
back room was johnnys idle comment as
he started toward the stage companys
corrals

  johnnys objective was the broken dol-
lar which palace of chance he intended to
surreptitiously approach from the other end
of main street in order that his friends
might not see him enter for should they
see him they would undoubtedly join him
for his better protection and johnny
wished to study his enemy unhampered by
any one that slay was his most vindictive
enemy was certain

  why johnny could not understand
why and he intended to know why that
there was a certain element of risk attached
to such close-range observation was true
but johnny held to the cheerful opinion
that hostilities would be riskier for slay
than for himself as has been stated
johnny was no marvel on the draw but he
possessed the ability to shoot accurately
from the hip and through the bottom of his
holster

  johnny skirting the rear of the stage
companys two corrals turned the corner of
the second enclosure and fell over the pro-
jecting tongue of a tiltless freight-wagon
he arose swearing softly and rubbing
barked shins his hat had fallen off he
felt about for it in the darkness and swore


adventure

some more he found it and straightened
just as the six windows in the back room of
the broken dollar sprang into dusty radi-
ance and a line of light showed yellowly at
the bottom of the door

  that door always did hang slanchways
observed johnny and thoughtfully edged
behind the freight-wagon

  the door opened for an instant the
form of a woman was silhouetted against
the light within then the door closed behind
her

  from the freight-wagon to the broken
dollar was not more than seventy yards
johnny heard the tink of a kicked tin can
a high heel clicked on a flat stone a tri-
angular splotch of white gliding toward the
freight-wagon gradually took shape in the
darkness the white splotch reached the
hind wheels and johnny heard the pleasant
whisper of silk noiselessly johnny scut-
tled to the safer shelter of the corral stock-
ade body flattened against the posts he
waited

  the white splotch appeared at the fore
wheels of the freight-wagon and bobbed up-
ward as the woman swung herself into the
drivers seat

  followed then the scratch of a drawn
match johnny stared the woman was
lighting a cigaret the pulsing flame re-
vealed the face of slays sister mrs lotta
wallace

  at this close range her extreme beauty
was more than ever apparent the black
hair growing low in a widows peak on the
forehead the finely arched eyebrows the
long and curving eyelashes the straight
nose the wide full-lipped mouth and the
firm and pointed chin above the round
smooth throat and lovely shoulders were
individually sufficiently striking in com-
bination with each other the effect was
bewildering yet johnny was left cold
he remembered scottys leopard and be-
came colder

  the situation was becoming impossible
the spark that was mrs wallaces cigaret
was not twenty feet distant at any mo-
ment the lady might climb down walk
along the stockade and discover him nat-
urally she would think he was spying on
her and to be suspected of that by such an
unknown quantity as slays sister was un-
thinkable why hadnt he kept on going
along the stockade when he had the oppor-
tunity scotty was right he was a fine

detective making mistakes this way
johnny sweated clammily and breathed as
little as possible

  suddenly he saw mrs wallaces cigaret
describe a firefly arc in the air and strike the
ground in a sputter of sparks there was
no sound of a movement on the drivers
seat wasnt the woman ever coming
down

  a long minutes silence then a whisper-

  my god what a life

  the exclamatory sentence was followed
by a pronounced sniffle then more sniffles
and finally choky little sobs it was evi-
dent that mrs wallace was striving to fight
down her emotion but her grief was too
great to be stifled easily

  i wish i were dead she moaned and
began to cry quietly and steadily

  johnny hating himself acutely began to
itch between the shoulders the itch wore
itself out after centuries of torture and a
cramp fastened sullenly on the muscles of his
left foot something alive and many-legged
fell off the stockade and landed on his
shoulder the something crawled along
the shoulder to his neck and tickled his ear

  with infinite caution he raised a nervous
hand removed a night-riding spider and en-
deavored to drop the loathsome thing at a
distance with the perversity of vermin it
clung whole-heartedly to his finger and he
was forced to slat it off against a post of the
stockade detaching in the process a loose
piece of dry bark the bark fell with a
rustle johnny caught his breath and
tensed his muscles for a flying start but
the sound of weeping abated not

  johnny took heart of hope and a long
breath the taking of the latter was inju-
dicious for many months dust of the cor-
ral stirred into action by the hoofs of the
stage-horses had been sifting and settling
behind that loose piece of bark the fall
thereof released an atomic cloud that at the
intake of the long breath promptly smote
the sensitive membrane of johnnys nos-
trils

  johnny gritted his teeth violently rubbed
his nose and otherwise by main strength
and a robust will contrived to suffocate the
sneeze before it was born he almost
strangled in the effort and was left with
tear-wet eyes and throbbing temples but
he had made not the slightest sound and
mrs wallace wept on forlornly

  johnnys gambling spirit urged him to
hidden trails



take a chance on departure between
spiders and itchings and incipient sneezes
the locality was fast losing its charm but
knowledge of the many tin cans held him
back there was an ancient cast-off stove
somewhere about too if he should fall
over that

  centuries became eons and eons became
eternity before there was an appreciable
lessening of that distressful sobbing on the
wagon-seat johnnys first-formed esti-
mate of mrs wallace had been gradually
altering by the time her sobs gave way to
long-drawn gasping breaths his opinion
utterly opposed that of scotty he could
not understand how she could remind scotty
of a leopard why she was just a little
wretched girl crying her heart out and that
was all johnny felt quite sorry for her
which could he have but known it is a
most dangerous feeling when the lady con-
cerned is as beautiful as was mrs wallace

there was a deep sigh from the
aforesaid lady and then a rustling
and a scraping as she swung down
over the double-tree to the ground white
shawl trailing across one shoulder she headed
back toward the broken dollar johnny
stretched legs and arms in aching relief and
dodged round the pole of the freight-wagon
to where he could follow her with his eyes

  he saw her figure become one with the
darkness and then reappear with magic-
lantern abruptness under one of the lighted
windows of the broken dollar here she
halted produced from her bosom a small
glittering object held it before her face and
dabbed at her features with an article the
size and shape of a small apple

  powderin her face poor lil thing
commented johnny ill bet her eyes are
some swole

  the back door of the saloon opened slay
stood in the doorway

  lotta lotta he called

  here i am she replied almost at his
elbow theres no need to yell your head
off

  didnt see you he said crossly come
in here quick whats the matter with
you why did you leave the wheel

  because i felt like it she flung back
smoothing a perfect eyebrow with the ball
of her thumb

  oh i see suppose you come in then-
if you feel like it

  when i feel like it i will

  she powdered her nose again with mad-
dening deliberation

  come in here at once the command
lost most of its force because slay pettishly
stamped his foot

  of course you frighten me to death
when you do that she observed sweetly
why dont you drag me in by the hair
are you coming in

  i meant to but since youve been so
pleasant i think ill go home

  slay stepped back and slammed shut the
door mrs wallace returned mirror and
powder-puff to their hiding-place blew a
kiss at the closed door and walked slowly
round the corner of the building

  shore got a mind of her own that one
remarked johnny maybe she aint such
a poor lil tiling after all

  pondering the unexpectedness of woman
johnny cautiously diagonaled across the
open ground to where beyond the outer-
most shack main street became a trail
here he turned townward and walking lei-
surely came to the broken dollar pushed
open the door and entered

  the long wide barroom was filled with
tobacco-smoke and customers the to-
bacco-smoke hung in layers in the atmos-
phere the customers hung in suspense
upon the turn of the cards and the caprice
of a tiny ball dancing within a sunken wheel
of many pockets

  johnny did not pause at the door he
walked without haste between the tables to
the bar at the other end of the room there
were only three men standing at the bar
one was the hard-faced tom keen he of
the two guns ganev of the dyed mustache
and a sharp-featured citizen known as spill
harper these three turned and surveyed
him as he approached johnny gave them
stare for stare fronted up to the bar rang
down a quarter and called for whisky the
bartender shoved forward a bottle and a
glass johnny poured out a scant two fin-
gers cupped his left hand round the glass
and leaned sidewise against the bar

  his attitude was lazy and his demeanor
careless but his half-shut sardonic eyes
missed no detail of what was passing under
the hanging lamps in that big room he
perceived that fully half the men in the place
were neglecting their play to watch him
some of them nudged each other and whis-
pered among themselves but when his eyes


adventure

fell upon these they ceased nudging and
whispering and affected an air of extreme
unconcern

  as johnnys gaze fell upon the roulette
table he smiled slightly he understood
slays anger at mrs wallaces defection
harry slay was behind the table now and
the patronage was slim with his sister to
spin the wheel roulette would have been
the most popular game in the room

   the gamblers face as he dropped the ball
and worked the lever was wooden he paid
and took in bets without once lifting his eyes
above the level of the table abruptly he
turned to a friend

  spin her will you bill he asked i
have a little matter of business to
arrange

  shore replied friend bill and slay
stepped out from behind the table and
walked straight toward johnny ramsay
standing at the door

  johnny had not been expecting any such
sudden move as this but he was in readi-
iness the heel of his right hand just
touched the butt of his gun slays hands
were swinging at his sides but this meant
nothing johnny had seen slay throw
down once before

  as slay approached johnny the room
following the hasty shuffling of folk intent
on leaving the zone of fire became as still as
midnight in a church johnny wondered
where slays bullet would make its little
hole he himself intended to put as many
pieces of lead as he could into slays abdo-
men johnny had killed three men since
beginning to punch cows for a living but
he had killed them in an impersonal way
that is at long range with a rifle he had
borneno special animosity against these
men he had shot them simply as a mat-
ter of course they had been rustlers out-
laws of the range wolves to be destroyed
on sight and he had not seen them die

  but here was a man he must shoot at
close range with a six-shooter how would
it feel to perforate an enemy and watch him
pass out under ones very eyes it sud-
denly struck him that he himself would in
all likelihood be too dead to observe with
any thoroughness the demise of another
the idea tickled his sense of humor and he
chuckled audibly

  not ten feet away slay halted his hands
held well away from his sides

  looking for me slay asked his pale

slanting eyes meeting johnnys fixed gray
stare

  i never hunt trouble replied johnny

  any hard feelings

  never use em

  have a drink

  shore

  the bartender made ludicrous haste to
serve the boss and johnny eye to eye the
two men drank off their liquor johnny as
etiquette required called for another round
they drank again then slay nodded to
johnny mentioned that he would see him
later and went back to his roulette table
the incident was closed and the spectators
resumed their pursuit of pleasure with noisy
avidity

  johnny standing alone at the bar-tom
keen ganey and spill harper had gone
elsewhere-sought to probe the true inward-
ness of the gamblers motive in seeking peace

  trying to make me believe hes willin
to be friendly he reflected but he shore
is a bigger man than i took him to be cornin
right out an facin it thisaway nerve an
slickness-hes got em both an yet not
ten minutes ago he stamped his foot at his
sister which is shore one kids trick

chapter x

the light that lies

	i he following afternoon johnny en-
sconced on the burr doorsill saw
slay and his sister coming up the street
slay frock-coated in spite of the heat was
leading a saddled horse and mrs wallace
radiant in gray and old-rose held a parasol
between her complexion and the sun she
was talking animatedly to her brother

  here come some friends o yores
johnny announced tapping the back of the
chair on which dorothy sat darning re-
ligiously

  whos with harry she asked calmly

  yuh knowed he was cornin he accused

  why of course she told him with a
quick sidewise glance were going riding
today

   so thats why yuhve got yore boots on
johnny was not in the least pleased and his
tone showed it

  my dear man what would you have me
wear

  i dont rnean yore boots i mean yuh

hidden trails



  what she teased

  johnny glared his displeasure at her
levity dorothy smiled

  what does it matter about me in-
quired j ohnny bitterly i was only spend-
in the afternoon id like to know why
yuh couldnt a gone ridin with me
dorothy

   you never asked me sir she said
there there johnny youll rum your per-
fectly good features if you persist in frown-
ing that way whos with harry

  his sister glumly

  she is dorothys dark eyes sparkled

  she bit off a thread with a vicious click of
white teeth the color in her cheeks
deepened johnny was totally oblivious
to these manifestations of feminine interest
he was too busy feeling abused

  the slay tribe arrived the gambler and
johnny were gravely restrained in their
greeting not so the ladies they kissed
each other with great fervor and my dear
before and after and bestowed compliments
with a buttery lavishness

  the gambler introduced johnny to mrs
wallace and asked dorothy if she was
ready

  right away she told him reaching in-
side the doorway for her quirt be with
you in three shakes you go on and saddle
up

  slay lifted his hat to his sister and johnny
and departed for the corral dorothy fol-
lowed a moment later after strictly enjoin-
ing mrs wallace and johnny to make
themselves at home till she returned
johnny trailed dorothy with sulky eyes
he hated slay what right had the man
to take dorothy riding

  wont you mrs wallace was saying

 wont i what he stared at her
without friendliness

  wont you talk to me ive already
asked you three times

  she had closed her parasol and now stood
with her hands clasped over the round
handle there was a talented patch of
court-plaster on her left cheek-bone her
lips were slightly parted and her eyes were
warmly pleading she was very lovely
and she wanted him to talk to her what
small hands she had the prospect of a
long afternoon full of empty hours and
shimmering heat decided johnny

  maam id shore admire to talk to yuh
he declared solemnly

  its dear of you to say that she said
i know you dont mean it but i really
would like to make up to you for dorothys
absence if-if i could and youd let me
this was spreading the jam rather thick-
ly but man is an obtuse animal johnny
grinned

  i guess now you an id oughta get along
together real well was his hearty endorse-
ment

  mrs wallace smiled and a fugitive
dimple showed for an instant in her right
cheek

  suppose we go over to my house she
suggested its near the river and theres
almost always some breeze

  that shore listens well said johnny
lets go

  they went half main street saw them
go and the whole town knew it ten minutes
later

  just watch her grin at him urged mrs
mace flattening a snubby nose against a
window-pane in her kitchen

  thats the first time i ever seen her out
walkin with a man declared mrs rags-
dale move over dear i cant see a
thing shes wearin the gray again aint

for a sallow thing like her to wear she
hasnt color enough look look see

quiet ways the cat

  oh shes a sly minx theyre the ones
ella the putty-faced things who act as

ragsdale holding resolutely to the main
road ill bet her legs aint thickern

jigger

adventure

if they sit on the porch we can watch em
fine

  but mrs wallace and johnny did not sit
on the porch the fascinating widow knew
all about a small town and she took her
guest into the house the punchers eyes
widened at sight of the sitting-room and its
appointments there were several water-
colors and three small paintings on the walls
above the door the mounted head of a
buffalo bull faced a splendid sioux war-
bonnet hanging on the opposite wall
chairs broad and deep a wide table a long
sofa covered with fat pillows a book-case
full of books and a thick soft carpet com-
pleted the picture even the sitting-room
at the bar-s was not so fine as this
one johnny moved cautiously spurs are
scratchy things

  mrs wallace excused herself and van-
ished through a doorway hung with a pair
of striped zuni blankets johnny slid
across the carpet to the nearest chair he
sat having care to his spins and absent-
mindedly pulled out the makings he re-
membered his manners as he was on the
point of striking a match and disgustedly
shot the white roll out of the window he
began to wish he hadnt come it was no
fun sitting alone this way where was mrs
wallace anyway

  at that moment she pushed aside the
zuni blankets and came toward him
smiling delightfully she was carrying a
small tray there were two tall glasses and
a square bottle on that tray times im-
mediately began to improve johnnys
somber eye brightened

  you may not like this she said hold-
ing out the tray its something i invent-
ed myself i call it texas pete

  texas pete was of a light brown color and
both glasses were full of him johnnys
fingers wrapped themselves round one of
the glasses mrs wallace took the other
set the tray on the table and sat down on
the sofa she tucked one leg under her
and swung the other child-fashion rais-
ing the glass to her lips she looked at
johnny across the rim and sipped slowly

  johnny did not sip slowly he was not
accustomed to drinking that way he
lowered the half-emptied glass to the arm
of the chair and grinned cheerfully

  reglar shore nough drink he assured
her whats in it

  she told him he stared aghast at the

tale of ingredients and looked down at his
glass with sudden respect

  one more o this here texas gent an
id shore push the bridge over said he
no maam no more ill just finish this
an call it a day

  youre not going yet she exclaimed
piteously oh you mustnt ill be so
lonely if you do

  once more the jam and the trowel such
flattery would have held johnny even if he
had intended going which he hadnt

  i wasnt thinkin o goin he told her
with an ease born of texas pete and the
ladys blandishments can i smoke
surely try one of mine

  he did and she taught him how two ciga-
rets may be simultaneously lit by the one
match besides being economical this
method of starting a smoke has a charm all
its own of course it necessitated johnnys
moving to the sofa he did not return to
the chair with every passing minute he
was feeling more at home he almost for-
got that the ladys brother was his enemy
he watched her leaning back among the
puffy cushions her eyes were deep as
wells then it suddenly struck him that
for the last hour he had been doing most of
the talking she had asked questions
apparently casual questions but they re-
quired lengthy answers

  well he said with a slight laugh im
shore warmed up to-day bet ive talked
an arm off yuh

  dont stop she begged in her earnest-
ness leaning forward and clasping her hands
round her silken knee im enjoying it so
i just love to hear how men do things

  do yuh

  of course tell me some more about
those indians did they keep right  on
stealing horses

  nobody keeps right on stealin hosses
maam he steals one hoss too many an
gets stretched an them injuns did an
they was

  i suppose it always turns out that way
said she softly

  yesm an its always that one hoss too

killin hold-ups an all they aint no
difference

  and yet nothing seems to stop the road-
agents in this county she was looking up
into his face with brilliant eyes

  no he admitted they seem to be
playin in right good luck but you wait
maybe yuhll have to wait a year or two
maybe longer but you wait theyll be
got maam

  im sure i hope so she declared lean-
ing back and patting her hair with long
slim fingers i had some silk for a gown
coming all the way from chicago and the
stage was stopped that trip and it was
raining and they ripped open the package
and left it there in the mud i could have
wept when the agent told me my pretty
yellow silk ruined i hope they do catch
them

  thats shore too bad about yore dress
he sympathized likely them bandits
didnt know what it was or they wouldnt
a touched it

he was watching a tiny pulse on
the side of her round throat he
hadnt noticed it before the little
telltale was throbbing steadily and fast
yet the color in her cheeks had not altered
a shade it was her own color too he
had made sure of that at the cigaret-lighting

  i wish you were the sheriff or a deputy
or something aud she

 me why

  because i believe you could catch them
i believe you could do more than this
idiotic sheriff

  hes doin his best maam aint yuh
takin the loss o that dress mighty hard
oh it isnt the dress its the idea of
these bandits being able to do what they
please they make a perfect joke of the
sheriff and his men oh if i were a man
id get out and do something id give
these road-agents a run for their money
you said yourself theres always one horse
too many id make the fane job that one
horse there are two thousand dollars
apiece offered for those bandits did you
know that

  id heard he nodded a grave head
it would certainly be worth almost any
mans while i should think youd try it
out the brilliant eyes had narrowed ever
so slightly and the little pulse was beating
quite rapidly now



  i aint a fool he said seriously i
never hunt trouble not never an two
thousand dollars aint enough for me to bet
my life against nohow spose now i lose
the life what goods two thousand wheels
to me no sirree you hear me talkin if
anybody wants to hunt road-agents let em
i wouldnt think o spoilin their fun i got
me a good job at the flyin-m an i aim to
keep it ybetcha

  what are you doing in town then

  oh i aint exactly started in yet the
answer came pat yuh see i figure to
spend all my money first maybe by the
first o next week ill go to huntin scottys
strays

  scotty mackenzie must be an easy-go-
ing employer to let you begin work with a
vacation

  men are scarce this was true i
told him i wouldnt ride for him lessn
i could have these few days off shucks i
dont draw wages till i start so whats the
differ to scotty scotty he said he wished
i was twins

  twins

  shore sos he could hire the other he
wants another man theys a whole heap
o country to cover-moren one stray man
can swing i tell yuh what maam yuh
ride when the flyin-m hires yuh

  was the little pulse beating less strongly
now he thought it was mrs wallace
turned her eyes away and inspected the
pink tips of her pretty fingers

  do you know she remarked suddenly
i like you

  thats-thats fine said he lamely for
he was somewhat taken aback

  yes she continued you tell funny
stories and you arent fresh i-i like it
theres not much for a woman to do in this
town of course im busy here in the
mornings and the broken dollar fills in the
evenings but the afternoons are awfully
long when theres no one to play with im
pretty lonely sometimes

  thats shore a fright maam he did
not know what else to say

  will you come to see me sometimes
she gave him another of her straight looks

  id admire to he declared and meant
it too

  and in a little while he said good-by and
walked away up main street

  is she or aint she he asked himself
- i shore dunno one thing shes


adventure

a shore nough lady even if she did show me
that new way o lightin a cigaret an she
likes me cause i dont get fresh huh id
like to see myself bet shed smack my face
good if i did

  he turned in at ragsdales the store-
keeper was alone in the place and greeted
him with a portentous wink

  i aint got no sofys nor goose-hair pillers
nor stuffed-up chairs to offer yuh soapy
observed but yuh can sit on the counter
if yore a good boy	

johnny stared coolly at the storekeeper
yuh seem to know a lot he drawled
ragsdale put his head on one side and
looked johnny up and down then he
scratched his ear

  nobody ever called you good-lookin
did they johnny asked soapy anxiously

  whatn - johnny began indig-
nantly

  well i was wonderin explained his
friend yuh know johnny my eyes are
good i can always see where im lookin
an i never seen nothin beautiful about yuh
ceptin the way yuh handle a rifle but
she aint seen yuh handle a rifle

  he paused in evident perplexity and
scratched the other ear

  its that butter yuh dont sell re-
marked johnny shes gone to yore head
i dont wonder neither the smells thick
enough to cut why dontcha open an-
other window

  it aint the butter denied soapy
its yore looks an you aint got none so
that aint possible shes magic thats
what she is magic no offense meant an
i know it aint none o my business but im
a married man an maybe i can use the in-
formation howdja do it be a good
feller an tell

  howd i do what

  howdja get to go see mis wallace
  whats unusual in that

  nothin only yore the first gent ever
went to her home to see her an walkin
up with her too thats why i say its
magic

  dont nobody ever go see her
plentyd like to but she wont have em
not that shes standoffish no sirree its
good mornin  with her an hare yuh
maam an she smiles an bows pleasant
as yuh please an twice as pretty an
thats all shell take yore money or pay
bets at the wheel with a word for all the boys

but its always not tonight im sorry or
some other time when a gent only wants
to walk home with her an she does it all
without hurtin a fellers feelins so this
here is yore lucky day johnny ill bet
if you was to go down to the broken dollar
yuhd break the bank

  the only man she had ever allowed to
call and she had asked him to call again
what was her purpose there was one
she was not the woman to break her custom
for a mere whim johnny wore his best
poker face but his eye was sardonic

  for a storekeeper soapy yore one wise
abraham said johnny ramsay and
changed the subject with a request for rifle
cartridges caliber -

  but soapy ragsdale did not stock the
odd calibers johnny departed for the
golden rule again he was out of luck-
-s were apparently a dead card in
paradise bend johny reflected that there
were other towns and other stores and
took heart of hope

  that evening johnny went to see dorothy
burr her greeting was casual-elaborate-
ly so there was a five-pound box of candy
on the table

  have some invited dorothy

  johnny thought he wouldnt eat any
candy thank you just the same a tooth
had been troubling him he feared to ex-
cite the little brute dorothy smiled
oddly

  you werent here when i got back she
remarked the smile becoming a trifle
fixed

  why no i wasnt confessed johnny
i was someers else

  isnt lotta a dear the tone was in-
genuous but the smile was now quite
fixed

  mis wallace shore shes all that
just as folksy as yuh please nothin
stuck-up about her

  i heard she took you home with her

  i guess she thought i was lonesome
all the same it was rather a conspicu-
ous thing to do i think she never has
any one to call

  so i heard dryly

  dorothy stared at johnny open-mouthed
well she burst out of all the smug
conceited men youre the smuggest and
conceitedest

  then she laughed but the laughter did
not ring true

chapter xi

very stray men

tlte shore wanted me stretched-

  	bad conceded johnny

  wat you tink-dees slay she was one
of dem bushwackair inquired laguerre
his hard black eyes glittering

  he wasnt one of em johnny said
decidedly

  how you know

  the half-breed was now wholly the in-
dian one saw back of those hard eyes the
long long line of relentless hunters of man

  in the first place the hosses they rode
was two chestnuts and a blacktail dun his
hoss was a big black hes got several-
two grays an a red-n-white pinto too
huh grunted laguerre i weel look

laguerre bimeby dey mak anudder un
anudder un den we catch dem by gar
de meestak de meestak alway de meestak
i have been de scout i have leeve wit

  so holding converse on the ways of
malefactors red and white they came to
the scene of the murders and their attendant
robbery three parts eaten by wolves an
offense to eye and nostril fanes dead
horse lay by the side of the road breath-
ing through their mouths the two men
forced their mounts up the side of the spur
to the pocket among the pines where the
road-agents had tied their horses

  the sign was more than seventy-two
hours old and it had been partly oblitera-
ted by the feet of scotty and the investiga-
ting committee yet laguerre looked quite
pleased

  dey tie two pony to dat pine said
he she ees de same pine un dem cayuse

  laguerre inhaled with complacency he
stretched his arms lazily and blew smoke
through his nostrils and smiled a slow smile
and licked his lips cat-fashion

  johnny had given his friend a circum-
stantial account of events at the bend
which account it must be said lacked
completeness in that johnny neglected to
mention mrs lotta wallace her actions
and his call upon her somehow he did
not feel it was necessary why drag her
in

  at dusk johnny and laguerre separated
the latter to ride the trail in to the bend
the former to cross the yellow medicine
and ever keeping that stream on his left
hand skirt the sprawling length of crow
mountain strike the flying-m trail at


adventure

wagon slue and arrive in town from the
north

  between eleven and twelve johnny dis-
mounted at the hitching-rail of the three
card he was to meet laguerre at the
three card but the half-reed was not
in the saloon nor was he at the jacks up
nor at soapy ragsdales buster was in
charge of the store but he didnt know
where pop was guessed he must be round
someers johnny guessed so too and on
his way to the broken dollar looked in
at the golden rule cal mason was there
buying tobacco and dan smith the mar-
shal was picking out a shirt a beautiful
thing of savage orange thickly besprinkled
with a chaste design of purple horseshoes

  cal mason greeted johnny with a grave
hare yuh behind which lurked the
smile of friendship but dan smith did not
go beyond a stiff nod johnny his sar-
donic eye fixed on the marshals ultra-
bilious choice leaned against the counter

  now thats what i call a shirt he
observed cheerfully

  i dunno as yuh got any license to call
it anythin said the liverish dan smith

  i was just admirin it marshal in-
sisted johnny no offense but yuhll
shore be right up in style back east they
sell shirts like this here so fast that the
factories all have to work overtime yessir
shore do an why cause all the laundry-
men buy em no soap-wrastlin chink
o the lot thinks he can go out walkin
sunday afternoons lessn hes inside one o
these shirts funny aint it

  johnnys eyes were no longer sardonic
they were calm and sweetly innocent as
they gazed into the face of the marshal
the latter very angry could have slain
him willingly but there are times when
to take offense means to make oneself
ridiculous dan smith did not wish to
appear ridiculous he compromised by
according johnny no further attention and
taking the shirt

  johnny allowing him thirty seconds
handicap followed he was in time to see
the marshal pause a hundred feet away
swing his arm and hurl something in be-
tween two houses after which the mar-
shal went into the jacks up saloon

  johnny hurried to where the marshal had
stood and dived into the space between the
two houses groping purposefully in the
darkness his fingers encountered a paper-

wrapped parcel he swept it up and re-
turned to the street in the light from
an open window he tore off a corner of the
wrapping a vivid purple horseshoe backed
by savage orange stared him out of coun-
tenance

  the marshal drinking with friends at the
jacks up bar felt a touch on his shoulder
he turned to behold the too-familiar fea-
tures of johnny ramsay the puncher
laid a parcel on the bar a parcel from whose
torn wrapper protruded the tail of dan
smiths recent purchase

  yore shirt johnny announced dis-
tinctly yuh dropped it-in the street

  the pause between the two halves of the
explanatory sentence was obvious the
marshal knew that he was being maliciously
badgered and he knew that johnny knew
that he knew but again this was one of
those times besides cal mason ex-
pectantly solemn was watching from the
doorway the marshal mumbled his
thanks tucked in the dangling shirt-tail
and stuck the package under his arm
johnny went out into the street there
the delighted cal mason fell into step at
his side

  yore style suits me averred cal
lets licker

  so they crossed the street to the three
card and said how twice after which
ceremony johnny drifted down to the
broken dollar and cal went home to tell
his wife how scotty mackenzies stray man
had run a blazer on dan smith

  at the broken dollar johnny found
laguerre playing poker with the express-
agent hard-faced tom keen and one of
slays dealers johnny smiled inwardly
for the half-breed was skilful at cards and
his skill was costing the others much money
all the blue chips on the table were in front
of laguerre and a blue chip in the broken
dollar was standard at ten dollars

  johnny on his way to the bar passed
the roulette table mrs wallace was be-
hind the wheel and business was very brisk
leaning against the wall at her back stood
her brother his hands were in his trousers
pockets and a long black cigar was clamped
between his jaws he glanced at johnny
with twinkling merry eyes and nodded
mrs wallace did not see the puncher she
was busy raking in several bets

  while johnny was still eyeing his first
drink in marched to his intense disgust
hidden trails



racey dawson racey was not due for
two days and here he was on the heels of
telescope johnny yearned to tell racey
what he thought of him

as racey came through the door-
way he slapped his side with a full
sweep of both arms dust flew
from him in a gray cloud his face was
ashen with it grinning widely he crossed
the floor straight to where johnny stood
at the bar and johnny saw that there
was dust inside his ears and down his
neck

  thought youd get away from me huh
cried racey teetering on his heels in front
of johnny tried to give me the slip
huh just cause i had a lil business over
on the two deer an was maybe now a
day late yuh run off an left me

  racey in his teetering apparently lost his
balance and fell forward against the dis-
mayed johnny who foresaw the crumbling
of his plans under raceys blundering but
raceys hand flung out to save himself
gripped johnnys arm and johnny felt that
member squeezed three times before racey
regained his equilibrium

  aw yuhd oughta come sooner johnny
said instantly djuh think i got nothin
to do but wait for yuh while yore hellin
round all over the country

  their voices were not pitched low but
laguerre facing them at his table across
the room gave no sign that he heard

  well yuh might a waited grumbled
racey les irrigate

  while they stood in silence the bottle
between them a man slouched in from the
street and halted inside the doorway he
was a stocky citizen with a sandy mustache
and an aggressive chin he pushed back
his hat and one perceived that his head
was curiously pinched-in at the temples
this characteristic combined as it was with
total absence of eyebrows and a wall-eye
did not make for attractiveness the
stocky man surveyed the roomful with a
cold and fishy stare his oblique gaze
passed over johnny and racey and appar-
ently fixed itself on a corner of the bar
still looking at the corner of the bar
wall-eye swaggered bow-leggedly up to
racey dawson and suggested drinks he
likewise smiled amiably revealing the lack
of two upper front teeth

  this heres my friend johnny ram-

say said racey flicking a tactful thumb
at johnny what might i call you
now i shore did forget to tell yuh my
name didnt i smiled the stranger his
crooked eye missing racey by four feet
which shes bale harper barkeep got
a lame arm im waitin for a glass

  the bartender hastily slid a bottle and
a glass across the bar as the newcomer
tilted the bottle johnny noticed that the
third finger of his right hand was cut off
at the second joint bale harper downed
his liquor at a gulp and instantly poured
out another glassful two or three fingers
were not for harper he filled his glass
a-brim and slopping over

  nothin like good measure said he
with a leer and added with emphasis
thats somethin i always aim to get
johnny made no comment he did not
like this bale harper

  got a brother round here someers
remarked mr harper with his gap-toothed
grin been lookin for him ever since i
drifted in you aint seen him have yuh
mister ramsay-feller about my size he is
sandy hair an face likewise called spill
aint seen him today answered the
puncher shaking an indifferent head yes-
day he was round him an tom keen
was together theres tom over there
maybe hell know

  but johnnys hint did not bear fruit
bale harper frowned in the general direc-
tion of tom keen and said he guessed hed
wait and see spill later

  - good whisky he declared and

had another

  im tired announced racey guess
now ill give an imitation of a young feller
rollin in how about the hotel johnny-
got a bed

  shore cmon

  they departed despite strong urging to
the contrary by bale harper but they
did not go to the hotel for privacy in
conversation was impossible in that hos-
telry the partitions were too thin and
there were many cracks hence it was
that johnny and his friend walking without
haste slid silently between soapy rags-
dales house and his corral and felt their
cautious way in among soapy ragsdales
neatly corded stacks of winter firewood

  whats up demanded johnny when
they were squatting on their heels between
two stacks

places

  then what

   we rode after them tillers like i said an
its night an all an we over-rode their
tracks so we had to work back an when
it come daylight we found where theyd
left the trail just south o bear mountain
an headed northwest that settled it for
jake rule northwest meant them killers
couldnt be bound nowhere else but thc-
emigrant hills on the dogsoldier so we
spraddled right along losin the trail an
findin her again an bimbey we lost her
good an proper like i knowed we would
in a creek

  shore they rode the water like ducks
an we never did pick up the trail again
hidden trails



but that didnt bother jake rule the
emigrant hills boys says jake well
catch em there we stopped at the anvil
ranch for fresh horses-but no news no-
body stopped there in two weeks an they
hadnt missed a single cayuse

 the b-bar-bs west o the anvil an
halls is east suggested johnny

 shore but we didnt have time to go
there we went on an we hit the emi-
grants an never seen a measly hoofmark
anywhere we met burns the wagon
wheel stray man an he hadnt seen no-
body i knowed they was behind us
someers-they had to be but jakes
stubborn like he always is an he combs
the emigrants industrious where we was
in the emigrants wasnt moren ninety or a
hundred miles to the bend so i decided to
come right along on an let jake an the
others scatter round all they wanted

 but what did yuh con bawlin out in
the broken dollar for about me not waitin
for yuh huh

on account o that bale har-
per feller this mornin at rocket
-i spent the last half o the night
at sinclairs an hes there too-he saddles
up when i do an allows if im goin north
hell trail along says he gets lonesome
an likes to tallj now he aint exactly
curious this bale aint but he shore does
like to talk an is one easy sport to make
friends with he dont make it hard for
yuh to up-end yore whole lifes history into
his ears if yuh want to no sir yuh could
do it without a struggle an i cant get
rid  him

 we stopped at a ranch along about
noon an he wants to rest his hoss so i
says ill be pushin along he says maybe
his hoss aint so tired after all an he strings
his chips with mine all the way to the bend
so i figured when he come into the saloon
after me the only thing i could do was to
bluff him by partly tellin the truth i
dunno nothin about that jigger outside o
what im tellin yuh but im bettin hes
a bad actor hes got a bad eye more ways
n one

 an yuh say he didnt ask any ques-
tions

  none to take offense at

 no he wouldnt but did he say any-
thin a-tall about any places

  places

  shore places-towns hills creeks the
like o that

  racey thought hard

  seems to me now he did say somethin
about the dogville trail

  now dogville is an infinitesimal hamlet
dotting the bluff at the junction of the
dogsoldier and the lazy rivers yet an
occasional freighter goes to dogville and
there is a trail connecting the village with
the bend trail north of cutter this trail
runs within a mile of the anvil ranch-house

  what did he say about the dogville
trail questioned johnny

  said wasnt she a-ova trail or

somethin

  what did you say

  i says i didnt know-never followed
the trail in my life

  yuh didnt painful amazement rode
johnnys tone

  shore why not

  tell yuh later was the dogville trail
all he asked about

  cutter-yeah cutter had tommy
mull changed the whisky at his hotel yet
an i says no same old whisky she always
was playin foxy myself see-lettin him
think i come through cutter

  oh yore a ringtail whizzer racey
honest if yuh had any more sense youd
be half-witted

  whatd i do id like to know didnt
i hafta say somethin to yuh in the saloon
didnt i hafta huh im askin yuh
didn i

  you was all right in the saloon it was
before yuh got there yuh was all wrong
id admire to know why grumbled the
offended racey

  this is why yuh was ridin an anvil
hoss wasnt yuh an yuh said yuh never
rode the dogville trail in yore life har-
per met yuh on the bend trail all right
yuh never seen the dogville trail so he
tries yuh again with tommy mulls whisky
at cutter you told him she was the same
old whisky didn yuh

  shore

  right there he got yuh ten days ago
tommy mull got religion an run every
drop o whisky he owned out on the grass
since this yuh couldnt get a drink in
tommys place if yuh was dyin an you
played foxy by blattin out - shes the
same ol whisky

  racey was dumb for a space


adventure

  i shore put my foot in it i guess he
mourned when johnny had rolled a scorn-
ful cigaret

  that anvil hoss showed yuhd been
west o the bend trail someers said
johnny sticking the cigaret in his mouth
for a dry smoke an cause yuh didnt
know nothin o the dogville trail nor
tommys gettin religion showed yuhd
been romancin round the country north
an west o cutter he could see by the
condition o the hoss yuhd been shovin
along hard an fast an a fellah in this
country dont shove his hoss lessn hes a
hoss-thief or in a posse

  maybe he took me for a hoss-thief
suggested racey hopefully

  o course if you was yuhd ride along
with him the way yuh did an yuhd bring
the hoss here to the bend where the brands
known wouldnt yuh

some use he was at rocket nearly a
week i heard dave sinclair say so

lugubriously hugging his knees

  i dunno hes somethin off whatever
his game is or hed never a made them
breaks about the dogville trail an tommys
whisky look here racey didnt nobody
see nothin o the jiggers that downed lute
holloway

   it was dark i tell yuh all bill lainey

  everybody was runnin round i tell

as could was all in the room with slim
there was slim a-layin on the bed with
doc kramer swabbin at his nicks an
puttin on bandages theys the lamp lit
an somebodys a-holdin it sos doc can
see to work an bill laineys breathin
hard an shufflin his feet an slims

scrouge forrard sos yuh can hear what hes
sayin now what did he say besides that
about they bein four of em an lutes
runnin out first nemmine how i know
it i know now what did slim say
thus adjured racey strove to live again
his part in the scene reconstructed by
johnny ramsay there was slim lying on
the blood-stained blankets of the bed doc
kramer had cut his shirt and trousers away
there were tourniquets on both legs slim
was talking-wheezing rather yvhat was
he saying-something about a horse wasnt
it yes that was it a light-colored
horse and one of the riders wore no hat
slim saw him against the stars was there
anything else racey dawson scratched
his head closed tight his eyes butcould
not remember another word of what slim
had said he opened his eyes and hitched
nearer his friend

i thought maybe yuh could tell me
somethin if yuh tried observed johnny
when racey had unbosomed himself a
light-colored cayuse huh dun maybe
cant say slim didnt

  an the gent with no hat-was he ridin
this light hoss

  he was ridin one o the others i
remember slim sayin that he seen him
plain against the stars after hed fell down
-slim fell down

  no hat now why wouldnt he wear
a hat i wonder pondered johnny
maybe he lost it contributed racey
maybe he had it tied to his saddle-
strings maybe she was a odd hat or
somethin an he was afraid somebodyd
recognize it maybe she was a wide white
hat with a high crown higher than most
djever see a hat like that racey

  the red-head raceys whisper was
sharp he had a hat like that

  he shore had an cornin back after
slim would be what hed do if he got the
chance

  slim did run him out o town kind o
abrupt
hidden trails



  that light-colored hoss-yuh cant tell
she might a been a dun

  spose she was what of it

  a lot maybe wait till tomorrow an
well go over the whole thing with tele-
scope-oh that was easy i guessed it
o course slim was a-layin on the bed
where else would he lay an somebodyd
hafta hold the lamp sos doc could work
an bill lainey always breathes hard an
shuffles his feet when hes interested an
slim couldnt help talkin gaspy if he had
three holes in him so there yare les
go to bed

un she ees not a wite hat evaded the half-
breed

  im gamblin they wont find it any-
how im writin to jake rule to find out

hold-ups an the red-head an he tied his
hat on his saddle sos she wouldnt give him
away its just what he would do

  he would if he did thus cryptically
mr dawson

  an three men with him whered he
get three men together to try an down slim
an holloway outside o the road-agent
crowd

  holloway had enemies sod slim
shore but scatterin a gent here an-
other there an all in different parts o the
county they might lay for lute an slim
separate but theyd never organize four in
a bunch if i could only be sure that
light-colored hoss was a black-tail dun any
way one of em was usin a - thats
somethin

  one ting observed laguerre eef de
red-head she belong to de hold-up outfit
wy don she stop de stage wit de res de
men wat have do dat are seex-foot mabbeso
but dees man wit de red hair she ees seex-
foot-four un no one was ever see man tall
as dat stop de stage or rob de minair

  i know that agreed johnny ive
asked a heap o folks an none of em have

ever seen a gent like this red-head but
djever stop to think that the folks he holds
up might be too dead to talk about it
afterward

  dat ees true nodded laguerre

  but somebodys got to see him if he is
one of em said racey

  somebody will-if he is how about
that stage-station job racey or would yuh
rather toss up for the stray man end
not me ill get a job in town myself
shes a right nice lil place-good scenery
good folks

  yeah suspiciously

  theys a right handsome-lookin lady
in the bend an i aim to meet her yessir
im satisfied to give my hoss a rest
whos the lady acute interest mixed
with the suspicion

  the one behind the wheel at the

broken dollar say-

  hes off cried the greatly relieved
johnny when racey dawson starts
talkin about a girl hes good for all
day les go away an leave him
telescope

  the three had rendezvoused in a thickly
wooded gulch on the eastern slope of old
baldy in accordance with their plan john-
ny and laguerre rode from there straight
to the flying m and racey dawson return-
ed to the bend racey had not informed his
two friends of his intention to loaf about
town a few days before starting to work
there was no hurry and roulette is a
fascinating game besides there was bale
harper to be investigated he couldnt
do that very well if he-was working of
course not he had more than a hundred
dollars in his poke and there wasnt a cloud
in the sky racey crooked a leg round his
saddle-horn and whistled the rakes of
mallow with joy and abandon an easy
conscience is a wonderful thing

  johnny and laguerre were openly and
loudly hired by scotty mackenzie ten
minutes after their arrival at the flying-m
the foreman doubleday of the sharp nose
and sharper eye took them at their face
value and sent them down to the bunk-
house doubleday did not fully compre-
hend the necessity of two stray men but
he knew scotty to be a creature of whims
no one ever even dreamed of questioning
scottys whims so when the old ranch-
man said that he himself would give the
new men their orders doubleday merely


adventure

shifted his quid and dismissed the subject
from his mind

  the next morning johnny and laguerre
rode away southward that men might
know of the place and manner of their
employment the two rode flying-m horses
and carried open letters signed by scotty

  on their way through town they stopped
at the burr house

  she aint home the voice of young
sammy barnes shouted from the corral

  aint mis burr got back from jack
creek yet a clever blend of surprise
and dignity on the part of mr ramsay

  you didnt come to see mis burr
retorted the turtle in loud unsympathetic
tones you come to see dorthy what-
cha bluffin for huh cant fool me i
seen yuh yore stuck on dorthy thats
whatcha are

  had the state of being stuck on dorothy
hidden trails



been a most flagitious offense johnny could
not have reddened more enthusiastically
mrs mace residing a few houses nearer
main street hurried outdoors to shake a
dust-rag mrs carey and tug wilsons
sister both had business on their doorsteps
heads appeared at various open windows

  harry-slay-give her-nother-box o
-candy-yestday-why-dontchu-give
-her-some

  which breathless combination statement
and question was delivered in the childish
squawk of mrs careys eight-year-old
mrs carey disappeared within followed
then the sound of smackings punctuated
by anguished wails an appreciative gig-
gle ran about the street

  johnny ramsay illogically hating wo-
men and small children with cordial inten-
sity wheeled his horse and rode off but
the giggle followed him to the corner of
main street

       it is true that all the world loves
a lover but it does not love two
lovers it laughs heartily and makes
bets on the outcome johnny recognizing
with mental writhing the factuality of these
things failed to comprehend why he should
be classed as one of the lovers true he
had called on the lady but not conspicuous-
ly true again he admired the lady but
likewise not conspicuously-at least this is
what he told himself

 i that he should be stirred to disgustful
irritation by dorothys seemingly compla-
cent acceptance of slays attentions was
but natural the gambler was much loo
equivocal a character to be comradely with
a young girl johnnys concern was all for
the young girl of course she was precisely
what he had told scotty merely a friend
absolutely nothing more

  johnny did not forget his declaration to
scotty to the effect that as no one else
seemed disposed to protect dorothy from
the man slay he himself would attend to
the matter he realized in bitterness of
soul that he was not making good

  look dere laguerre said surprisedly

  johnny looked ahead of them the stage
companys horses were being driven by a
hostler to water racey in overalls mount-
ed bareback was talking to the hostler

  when yuh get back racey was saying
put on some axle-grease to keep the flies
off that v-t hoss where he cut himself an

scout round after that neck-yoke tug says
shes near the big corral someers

   the hostler departed in the dust of his tit-
tuping charges and racey looked into the
faces of his two friends and smiled-one-
sidedly his upper lip being bruised and
puffed to twice its normal size raceys
right eye was thoroughly blackened and
an abrasion marked the left side of his
jaw there were scratches on his nose and
his knuckles were skinned

  what hit yuh asked johnny

    skinny devinney the station boss
replied racey

  dont blame him what was yuh
tryin to do

   i was just arguin with him

   arguin

   shore i asks him for a job all so pretty
and polite an he says somethin about not
wantin no feller in hair pants a-workin for
him then i just had to argue with him
johnnys eyes strayed toward the com-
bined stage station and express office be-
low one of the windows pieces of broken
glass and splintered sash littered the ground

  looks like the window got busted
hazarded johnny

he done it-on his way out explained
racey he didnt want to go he added
johnnys eyes rested on raceys features
i expect he said drily i notice he
gave yuh a job

  yeah he gimme his yuh see after
hed went there was the job left an orphan
an there was me an tug wilson he says
it looked just like providence me im the
station boss myself

  lucky for you devinney didnt have a
gun observed johnny yuh better keep
yore eye skinned racey shes just pos-
sible he may organize with one an come
back a-huntin him his job

  he-he had a gun racey said in some
embarrassment i kind o had to pry it
away from him before hed act decent
laguerre laughed delightedly

  didnt he try to throw down de-
manded johnny

   oh he tried admitted racey

   yuh bats-eyed ol son-of-a-gun john-
ny drawled in keenest admiration

  see yuh later grinned racey gotta
take this accordeen to the blacksmith
johnny stared after racey and his brows
drew together

  more i think of it he observed to


adventure

laguerre the less i like this wrastlin
round with skinny devinney seems like
she was kind o unnecessary an a heap
likely to come high for racey ive heard
skinny was a hard customer

  les go see heem said laguerre

  but the ex-station-boss was not to be
found in the bend skinny devinney had
saddled a horse and pulled his freight

  an i always thought skinny was a
fighter their bartending informant re-
marked with disgust after gettin his
cork pulled thataway he cant never show
up in this town again thats a cinch
shore but throats a leetle raw this mornin
ill take a cigar f yuh dont mind

  help yoreself well take about twenty-
five apiece i like a good smoke i do an

  between the medicine an dry creek

wander telescope

  good morning mister ramsay

  it was a gay and sunday morning voice
that spoke and johnny in the act of mount-
ing slid his foot from the stirrup and turned
dragging off his hat mrs wallace smiled
up into his face with eyes and mouth

  gmomin maam said johnny and
wished telescope would go away

  but the half-breed had no intention of
doing any such thing he sat quite still in
the saddle rolling a cigaret and unobtru-
sively observing the lady from under his hat
brim johnny greatly against his will was
forced to introduce him

  you havent forgotten about coming to
see me she said to johnny in a low tone
now maam how could i

  tonight the black eyes pleaded

tion now and then this evening will
be then do come ill be all alone

  id shore like to but i aint a-goin to

tested johnny but by tonight ill be in

  oh i am sorry said she but youll

  again the red lips parted in their fascinat-
ing smile she inclined head and shoulders
in a little bow that included laguerre
swung her parasol and strolled away

from main street to the farewell trail

nodding sagely gimme de match

to be continued
captain tsjlast vbgage

his is a story of the sea the great
inexplicable sea a tale of the
strangeness of life of the trickiness
of chance of heat and the east and
the vagaries of a mans mind but primarily
of the sea for it could have happened no-
where but at sea it required the setting of
the sea the loneliness of the sea the brood-
ing power of vast spaces that inevitably and
inexorably takes possession of the human
soul kneads it molds it goads it to a pre-
destined goal

  the sea is the fate the master the neme-
sis of those that follow it the sea is the
great kismet and it is more it is the
unalterable past and a sham future in its
stillness its loneliness its vastness mem-
ories are mirrored back and in its depths
in its reposeful beauty are dreams not of
what will be shall be but of what ought to
be should be

  this story is not my story i was merely
an onlooker a supernumerary you may
say i had no vital part in this drama this
fifth act of a mans destiny this is the
story of the sea and of captain horace
findlay and his ship the aladdin

  during my life at sea i have sailed under
many commanders and of them all captain
findlay was the strangest his picture stands
out vividest sharpest-drawn against the
background of the past that last impres-
sion of him alone on the bridge in the night
is eternal but even at first he had an
unreal mystifying fascination

  he seemed to be at once an appeal and a
command he was heavy-set and taciturn
a little up in years-about sixty-rather
shortish bald keen-featured sailow-com-
plexioned he wore a full beard black in-
terwoven with gray black that had lost
its color in places a beard long and square
that gave him a religious almost patri-
archal appearance but his eyes were most
impressive-no impressive is not the word
-they were disconcerting bewildering as
a strange childs

  their color was black a color not uncom-
mon or remarkable but the strangeness i
might almost say the weirdness was in their
expression imagine a perpetual painful
frown thick eyebrows long dark eyelashes
and a look that seemed troubled and ap-
pealing as if questioning fate and with this
a spasmodic restlessness at times the eyes
hardened if they were turned at one they
seemed bright and probing abnormally so
but mostly they looked beyond one as if seek-
ing something as if seeing into the unseen

  in the spring of  i signed on as second
mate in the aladdin at liverpool where the
ship was owned and took the train across
the country to newcastle where she was
loading i was excited it was to be my
first long trip the itinerary that the owners
had mapped out to me wasnewcastle bom-
bay colombo hongkong textiles and ma-
chinery from newcastle to bombay rice
from bombay to colombo tea from co-
lombo to hongkong




adventure

  i was becoming aware of the vastness of
the world i was going to the vast mys-
terious orient the very name had a charm
and a fear it was as far removed from the
commonplaces of existence as the stars are
from the moon

  i left liverpool late one evening curled
up in my seat and slept soundly through the
night before dawn i woke up feeling sick
a curious smell was assailing my nose an
insidious pungent smell i roused myself
and looked out into the departing night
gas lamps burned feebly in the gloom two-
story houses steep-roofed and desolate
huddled close together along the embank-
ment they seemed dead blind and dead
the windows were dark black niches in the
pervading gloom empty eye-sockets look-
ing out upon the world unseeing

  farther off somber chimneys reared
against the sky from which rose slowly thin
clouds of smoke soaring heavenward like
prayers from burning hearts farther still i
saw glimpses of the dirty gray of the river
where small smoke-emitting things crawled
back and forth incessantly above to the
north lay the city clinging to the high
hillside and above all the jagged serrated
skyline of newcastle

  the city had awakened when i stepped
off the train slowly i sauntered through
the streets toward the docks the squalor
of the place was unthinkable concentrated
ugliness everywhere and fog busses rum-
bled along the pavement horse-drawn
trucks clattered and screeched round cor-
ners soot-smirched houses crowded the
streets at long intervals there were breaks
in the lines of grimy buildings as if here and
there a tooth had rotted down to the jaw-
bone of rock in the citys multiple rows of
teeth

  passing along i saw interminable vistas
of whisky signs gaudy clothing shops pub-
lic-houses restaurants forbidding ware-
houses fat florid old women baskets on
arms strutted about importantly sailors
strolled along leisurely hands tucked far
into the horizontal pockets of their dun-
garees dirty children barefooted bare-
headed ran about in the march slush at a
pretense of play the squalor seemed to
be slowly strangling me i longed for the
sun for the east for the orient

  at last i came to the docks here too
the squalor persisted the tyne was in-
credibly dirty yellowish brown and slug-

gish a slovenly prostitute of commerce a
pall of fog and smoke hovered over the
water and hid the farther side black im-
posing bridges rooted in granite hung sus-
pended in the air like fingers pointing ac-
cusingly into the mist

  swift powerful tugs scooted from fog-
bank to fog-bank sometimes alone some-
times with blunt-nosed barges in their
wake an irregular fence of masts and
funnels lined the wharves beyond the
ramparts of the dock-sheds and a noise
as of a carnival of devils rose from the
loading and unloading ships

  again commerce the strident discords
that constitute the symphony of commerce
the heavy rumbling of trucks the clanking
of chains the screeching of whistles the
pounding of winches the clanging of bells
the groaning of donkey-engines the hiss of
escaping steam ships of all nations con-
tributed to the turmoil ships not only from
all parts of britain but from germany
from france from norway from russia
from denmark from spain from the colo-
nies

in this international exposition
of industry and enterprise i found
the aladdin of liverpool a fine
ship a ship to be proud of long beautiful
lines a bow that bespoke speed-twelve
knots at least-as fine a two-thousand-ton
steamer as i have ever seen she was
loading-it was somewhat of a shock-
printing-presses for bombay i did not
like it it did not harmonize with my con-
ception of the east printing-presses spell
the death of mysticism of romance of
adventure printing-presses mean hard
logic and dry facts

  most decidedly i did not like this inva-
sion of the charmed orient by occidental
civilization i liked the other part of our
cargo-textiles-better it suggested adven-
turesome trips into the jungle trading with
savages pioneering aboard the ship the
longshoremen held sway all was bustle
they worked as if anxious to forestall an
impending doom as if their lives depended
on the quick loading of the disillusioning
printing-presses for bombay

  dodging up the gangway like an escaped
thief i made my way amidships and knocked
on a door that i guessed led to the captains
quarters i heard a gruff voice say
come in and entered cap in hand
captain findlays last voyage



captain findlay was sitting on a settee
at the back of the room under the port-
hole an open book a bible in front of
him

 he gave me a look from under those
frowning eyebrows of his that sent the
jumps through me and made my eyes dance
about the room in the next second i looked
at everything at the ceiling the walls the
floor everything except those eyes there
wasnt much to be seen to be sure a white
ceiling sea-blue walls a green carpet a
chair a bunk half hidden behind curtains
charts chronometers a bookcase a picture
of the aladdin a picture of the companys
new offices in liverpool and a large photo-
graph of a girl rather plump stupid-look-
ing with abundant hair handled with puri-
tanical firmness and wearing the redundant
flounces of forty years ago

  well he said sharply in a deep bass
voice what do you want

  he was looking impatiently into his bible
again and i introduced myself awkwardly
hurriedly

  all right he said without looking up
your cabin is down the passage the second
from the end get your duds aboard as
quickly as you can and report to-to the
mate we sail in the morning

 he resumed his reading i was dis-
missed

  i installed myself in my cabin-my lug-
gage had arrived by this time-and went
to look for the mate i didnt find him
he was ashore spending his last day in eng-
land with his wife but i found the chief
engineer duncan a big easy-going fath-
erly scotchman who took me about and
introduced me to the ship

 he was immensely proud of her she
might have been some near relation of his
the way he gloated over her perfections
it was with unconcealed relish that he
pointed to a brass plate that bore this in-
scription 

harland  wolf belfast 

  just three years old he said shouting
above the din of the docks and a beauty-
cuts through the water like a liner-made
four trips to the east already

  he crossed the deck walking in true
sailor fashion slippered feet far apart his
big body swaying gently slowly from side
to side like a square-rigger becalmed

  some coolie stokers squatted in a corner

of the deck yellow and fantastic watching
the fracas at the hatches the apparent
death-struggle between the dockers and
the unwieldy crated machinery and chat-
tering at an incredibly rapid pace that to
the uninitiated seemed like nothing but a
child playing with castanets a bit of
eastern mystery amidst the brutal plain-
ness of european civilization

  how long has captain findlay had this
ship i asked when we had reached the
comparative quiet of the saloon-deck

  he just joined the ship a month ago on
her return home to be overhauled barker
who had her before him was transferred to
a bigger boat

  and who is the first officer i inquired
is he a new man too

  pennington penny we call him no
he used to have your job-we didnt
think he had it in him to get a mates berth
but the owners evidently thought other-
wise-well some queer things happen

  he sighed meditatively

  a tall angular individual oil-bespattered
his face like a clowns decorated with black
smudges appeared at the end of the passage
waving his arms excitedly windmill fash-
ion his black hair hanging in a disorderly
mass over the caverns of his eyes like a
thatch he screamed nervously-

  oh chief we want you in the engine-
room

  then he disappeared

  duncan looked after him with benevolent
contempt with a gesture expressive of
good-humored despair and of irritated
resignation he said apologetically

  thats the second engineer-he seems
to be excited-i suppose he cant fit a nut
to a bolt down there well i have to see
what is the matter anyway

  and he waddled off at a toads pace

  the voice of the harbor bellowed
moaned groaned shrieked and hissed
throughout the day far into the night
only in the few darkest hours after mid-
night did it rest exhausted while the men
the pawns of this tremendous activity
snatched the sleep that would sustain
them through another day just another
day long before dawn the clamor began
again commerce blared her trumpets
beat her drums shrilled her sirens rattled
her tambourines and the strident discords
of the symphony sent the men like ants
back to their work


adventure

      i rose with the dawn surprised
bfrgd that i had slept in the tumult
rose to work and adventure i
looked out of the port-hole saw that the
weather was clear dashed some water in
my face swore at the obstinacy of my hair
hurried into coat and cap bounded out of
the door and-stopped outside i saw a
strange sight

  the mate-i guessed it was he-was in
the passage in his shirt-sleeves his cap
balancing on the back of his head and a
blubbering female hanging about his neck
he was a broad middle-sized fellow bow-
legged blond blue-eyed with a loose
insolent mouth under a thick mustache
of the woman i saw only the back a large
formless gaudy back she was his wife
he told me later and i believed him

  she had spent the night aboard and was
now engaged in bidding him an effusive
farewell when he saw me he shot me
an irritated ominous glance over the
womans heaving shoulder and i hurried
aft out of sight

  the boatswain already had the crew on
deck and we worked with a will battening
down hatches clearing the decks of debris
and coal-dust making ready for departure
at length the pilot appeared on the bridge
along with the captain who stern patri-
archal enigmatical was the inspiration of
awe and uneasiness

  the blubbering female stood on the dock
clutching a much-used handkerchief the
watchman ashore threw off the last hawsers
we swung into the river and followed the
tide down-stream bridges opened before
us and closed behind shutting out the
docks shutting out the clamor shutting
out england

  after we were well out of the harbor the
two engineers the mate and i breakfasted
together in the mess-room it was our
last indulgence in sociability before sub-
mitting ourselves to the inexorable routine
of the sea with the captain on the bridge
and the donkey-man in temporary charge
of the engine-room we enjoyed our irre-
sponsibility the meal was fine-we had
ham and fresh eggs i remember-and
the easy motion of the ship brought on a
luxurious feeling of well-being of content-
ment with life

  the mate alone was grouchy he hadnt
gotten over his irritation of the morning
his embarrassment at the sight of me in the

passage he grumbled continually against
the ship against the captain against every-
thing in general and the engineers taunted
him mercilessly

  i wish they had transferred me too
he said scowling at nothing in particular
the they referring to the owners i wish
they had put me in a decent-sized ship
i have sailed in this tub about long
enough

  of course jeered thompson the
second engineer beaming with derision
they ought to have made you skipper
of that new boat instead of barker

  she is a pretty good sort of tub all the
same penny said the chief consolingly

  its the captain i object to- the
mate resumed his declaration of grievances
-i dont like to sail under a man who
does nothing but read his bible it isnt
natural its uncanny why it seems
that he is deathly afraid of the east

  why i cut in mystified

  he shrugged his shoulders

  nobody knows-perhaps because he lost
a ship out there in a collision five years ago
she was the biggest ship the company
owned at the time four thousand tons if
i remember right since then he has
never been east of suez he is afraid he
added contemptuously

  duncan smiled broadly and drawled
blandly insinuatingly-

  i have known mates who are not over-
brave

  his assistant exploded with laughter
he laughed violently raucously thrusting
his long lank jaw far in the direction of the
mate

  that was a good one wasnt it penny
he rasped do you remember that night
in calcutta

  the mate glowered at him viciously
turned coppery red glared at me and
bounded out of the mess

  what happened that time in calcutta
i asked

  nothing duncan lied

  meanwhile the aladdin gathered speed
sped on swiftly silently heedless of the
eccentricities of those that manned her
demanding only her sacrifice of coal and oil
from her coolie minions in the stoke-hole
she sped on to the east was the sea
merging into the horizon to the west the
british coast low flat criss-crossed with
hedges and dotted with houses like dark
captain findlays last voyage



scratches and pock-marks on the dismal
brown-gray march landscape

 toward evening of the next day we
steamed into the channel sneaked in
between the sentinel chalk-cliffs of dover
and calais by the age-stained weather-
worn walls of dover castle ablaze in the
sun high upon the rocks a relic of the
mystery of dark ages of ancient adventure
a flock of wild geese flew overhead-other
adventurers the vanguard of summer

 the scenes changed pictures changed
ships passing in the night abrupt gleams
from lighthouses piercing the darkness
the swish of parting water before the bow
sounding startlingly loud night passed
again glimpses of land black masses of
rock in the distance then the far stretches
of the sea unbroken limitless eternal
bridging the abysses of the earth

bin the ordered monotony of our
first week at sea nothing happened
but the atmosphere aboard assumed
a gloomy aspect the uneasiness that was
to characterize this voyage was noticeable
already the first morning and threatened
to become  chronic it was undefinable
but undeniable i had a great deal of
time to wonder about it though i did not
discuss it with any one

  i saw the mate only when i relieved him
on the bridge-a fact which i considered
a heaven-sent boon-and the second engi-
neer only when he happened to be delayed
in the engine-room and came popping out
on deck while i was on duty duncan
i saw oftener he was on my watch and
he had the habit of hanging over the rail
staring into the water for half-hours at a
time deeply immersed in contemplation
of the receding waves occasionally when
i passed he spoke to me

 the captain was all but invisible he
kept to his cabin ate there slept there
in the company of his bible his charts
his chronometers and that absurd picture
of the girl that had lived in another age
he was however a good sailor when
orders were needed he emerged from his
seclusion like an omniscient spirit

  at times in the night he would appear on
the bridge his sallow face looking un-
earthly white above his black flowing
beard immovable staring into the dark-
ness his presence and his absence were
alike disconcerting his absence as well as



his presence dominated the ship he was
an object for speculation a background of
mystery

  we coaled at gibraltar late one night
we approached the harbor from afar we
saw the glow of lighthouses that stood
like blinking watchmen on either side of
the strait streams of light crept down
from the searchlights on the mountain
and crawled about on the water as if seek-
ing something inestimably precious the
aladdin slid slowly timorously into the
harbor nosed her way up to the dock made
fast and rested for the first time since she
steamed out the tyne

  when pennington appeared in mess the
next morning he looked even more in-
solently overbearing than usual as if he
were the confidant of some grand per-
sonage bearing state secrets locked in his
brain he sat down in triumphant silence
outside on the dock a huge steam-shovel
groaned and exerted itself feeding coal into
a chute that led to the belly of the ship

  did you see the captain last night
said the mate at length unable to retain
at the same time his superiority and his
secret

  no said i

  well he said in a confidential whisper
he was off his head last night plumb
crazy he kept muttering she will ram
us she will ram us and there wasnt a ship
within half a mile

  he surveyed his audience with provoking
condescension

  what side did you sleep on last night
asked duncan sympathetically

  im telling the truth flared back the
mate

  of course mocked the second engi-
neer was he as scared as you were the
time you ran afoul of that blooming sikh
in calcutta

  he let loose his high-pitched comic-
opera laugh pointing his long ridiculous
jaw in penningtons face

  the mate put down his cup of tea with a
clatter sputtered impotently turned livid
with rage

  how often do i have to tell you he
roared that i was not afraid of that
blasted hindu i didnt want his woman
i ran because i had an appointment to keep
not because i was afraid you-you-
you-you-

  he choked and coughed violently


adventure

  and to think chuckled the vindictive
thompson that that blooming sikh only
looked at you after you kissed his woman
was it your tender conscience that got
into your legs do you remember dun-
can the beautiful tumble he took when
he turned the corner of the bazaar

  and he laughed again his star-comedian
laugh loudly insinuatingly mercilessly
i too smiled i could see bow-legged
blustering pennington running for his life

  meanwhile he sat there dark as a thun-
der-cloud fuming and sputtering invectives
ludicrous a caricature of some heathen god
of wrath

  these squabbles were common and never
quite settled they were certain to break
out on the least provocation the warfare
was continual a sort of guerrilla warfare of
words but i was little concerned i was
a non-combatant the east beckoned
the lure of the east i was interested only
in that i had eyes but for the changing
scenes 

  gibraltar was left behind the cliff grew
smaller less awesome the cluster of palms
on the african shore retreated into the
landscape the mediterranean blue im-
mense summery predominated was our
world and beyond that india was dream-
ing a fascinating mystery overshadowing
to me almost obliterating the mystery of
the aladdin the strange uneasiness ema-
nating from the captain

  the low egyptian shore hove into view
beautiful bathed in the sunlight nour-
ished by the nile green as a pasture in
paradise but soon this beauty passed
like a splendid dream the desert ap-
proached low desolate dismal and in the
midst of this desolation port said

   at this noisy dirty outpost of the orient
this caravansary for eastern trading-ships
we coaled again and then with our bunkers
filled steamed slowly into the canal and
through this gap in the desert passed like
proud emissaries of occidental civilization
into the red sea the hallway of the orient
a new kind of squalor revealed itself arid
sand-swept plains flanked by bleak hills and
ruled over by a merciless sun the heat
became almost intolerable the iron decks
burned at the touch distant objects the
coast and the mountains beyond the coast
seemed to waver and dance in the shim-
mering haze that overhung the sea

  it was degenerating we became too

  lazy positively too lazy even to eat the
hurricane deck covered imperfectly by
an awning was the only comfortable spot
on board as for the stoke-hole with no
breeze blowing into the ventilators it must
have been about unbearable but some-
how the coolies bore it

  the lights of mecca gleamed low over
the water on the port side a p  o
liner homeward bound had just passed
us silently like a thought born of the
darkness the air was calm and cool
after the intense heat of the day the
night was beautiful the stars shone with
a lustrous brilliancy peculiar to desert and
sea they seemed to have a touch of
humanness  they seemed highly intellec-
tual understanding and almost femi-
ninely vain mirroring themselves in the
shining placid sea

  i was leaning over the railing in front
of the wheelsman musing dreaming about
the east when i heard steps behind it
was the captain very correctly dressed
in a white cotton suit and white uniform
cap he walked slowly haltingly a pain-
ful frown on his face and a look in his eyes
that had fear terror in it suddenly he
exclaimed almost screamed to the helms-
man

port the helm quick dont
you see her lights do you want
her to ram us

  surprised shocked by my carelessness
i looked about rubbed my eyes looked
everywhere-there were no lights some-
thing akin to a chill crept down my spine

  sir i said you are mistaken there
are no lights

  he looked at me through me beyond
me with those awful eyes of his

  what the devil he roared then check-
ed himself with a convulsive effort and
looked away well he said all right

  he turned and left the bridge

  i stared after him in an imbecile fashion
i fear then resumed my former position

  sir said the sailor

  yes-what is it

  you dont happen to know if the cap-
tain keeps liquors in his cabin do you
sir

  that is none of your business i said
as harshly as i could

  aye aye sir

this incident troubled me worried me
captain findlays last voyage



for a time it seemed to bear out penning-
tons hints but soon it lost its freshness
and while i did not forget it it ceased to
worry me i ascribed it to the heat or
drink or dope thought it of little im-
portance the nearness of the east was
responsible for this easy optimism it was
the charm of the unknown the singular
attraction of the unseen

 through the current of the strait of
bab-el-mandeb we escaped into the ara-
bian sea and after coaling again at aden
a desolate cluster of houses and huts
roosting in the crater of an extinct volcano
stood out to sea for india india i felt
like shouting bombay the name had
a singular foreign flavor it savored of
beauty and adventure and grotesque pagan
gods just a week more at sea

  the weather was fine a clear sky and a
blazing sun most of the time and a little
sea after we got into the trade-winds on
the whole the trip was pleasant and un-
eventful though i noticed a gradual change
in the captain he seemed more restless
he sought the bridge more began to haunt
it in fact-i suppose his cabin was too hot
for comfort even though it contained his
charts and chronometers and that old
picture that picture of the puritanical
girl

  it was disconcerting to have him on the
bridge he disturbed my mind but still-
still i could not help feeling sympathetic
toward him there was something very
pathetic about him that fixed expression
of wo about the eyes for instance and
that fearful searching of the sea especially
at night for some unseen danger

 the mate too had changed somehow
his manners had become ingratiating he
treated me like the proverbial long-lost
brother since there was no apparent
cause for this change i concluded there
was something he wished me to do some-
thing that for some reason or other he
didnt want to do himself i wasnt
wrong

  early in the morning on which we sighted
land he joined me on the bridge i was
on duty the captain was below he
began to talk-his chief business in life it
seemed

 so he said you have never been in
india before

  i expressed a superfluous negation

 its a fine country he said medi-

 tatively lot of women - first-class

whisky-

  for a moment he lost himself in antici-
pated joys then regretfully returned to
the ship

  i want you to be candid with me he
said confidentially what do you think
of the captain

  i suppose he is all right i replied
guardedly

  that is what he isnt he wagged his
head to emphasize the statement he is
off his head its plain as daylight

  after waiting in vain for an answer he
continued smirkingly

  if i were you i would report him to the
harbor commission at bombay i would
do it myself if i hadnt a wife at home
this last was an obscure point his
wife at home seemed to me to be an irrele-
vant factor that had nothing to do with
the affair but i did not contradict him
for the moment i had forgotten everything
concerning the ship india the paradise
of my dreams was taking shape becoming
real rising out of the ocean meeting me
all that i had hoped it to be it seemed to
be beautiful full of mystery fraught with
an unfathomable meaning

  slowly it came nearer soft velvety
greens became visible everywhere palms
and a luxuriant undergrowth of jungle
hedged in the coast the city the islands
in the bay the shelves of rice-fields that
like steps for a mighty god mounted to the
inland hills

  the captain was on the bridge calm
efficient patriarchal i began to doubt
the soundness of my memory the incident
in the red sea seemed preposterous un-
believable yet still still 

  duncan whose attitude toward me had
assumed a benevolent fatherliness volun-
teered as my guide on my first excursion
ashore in this land of beauty and mystic
dreams the first glance of the inner
harbor had been disappointing it re-
minded me of that hotbed of commerce
newcastle vistas of wharves and quays
ships of many nationalities english
dutch french norwegian and a solitary
steamer flying the stars and stripes of the
united states

  the noise and the bustle were here too
the discordant symphony of trade only
the dockers were different they were
children of the east sandaled turbaned


adventure

dark sinuous in their movements and
mysterious one wondered whether they
felt like white men thought like white men
died like white men they were a profound
enigma

  the city itself was eastern unmistakably
so picturesquely so even the victoria
railway terminus with its opulent archi-
tecture its lavish decorations its towers
and minaretseven to the statue perched
high on its dome was oriental indian it
might have been the palace of some fabled
maharajah

  near this terminus i received one of my
strongest impressions of this first intimate
view of the east curious that a beggar
should make such a profound impression
but he did he seemed to typify the
dignity the fatalism of the east he was
old his straggly beard white his eyes
sightless his turban was a medley of
colors a kaftan of white cotton covered
his lean body but it was the bearing of
the attenuated figure that gripped me

  he seemed more like a statue a statue
with a hoarse mechanical voice than a
human being his spirit seemed to have
left the body leaning against the wall
while it flew untrammeled to other spheres
he seemed at once to be a true representa-
tive of the east and a contrast to the
motley crowds that passed him by with
graceful gliding rhythmical movements

late in the afternoon something
happened that rather marred our
keen enjoyment in the pilgrimage
ashore certainly it disturbed our minds
we were drinking tea in the kapad bazaar
sitting near the main entrance when a
person we knew well came in he didnt
appear to be looking for company so we
remained silent unseen

  he looked about furtively as if ashamed
to be there sneaked up to a fakirs booth
and hurriedly bought a heathen charm
it was guaranteed so an inscription in bad
english above the booth said to avert
danger from evil spirits bad luck wild
animals and several other more or less
fantastic things besides reserving for the
bearer a berth in the mussulmans paradise

  the buyer was captain findlay he
sneaked out again pushing his way rapidly
through the throng we stared after him
nonplused why did he want the charm
why the secrecy what new inconsistency

had arisen in his character hitherto he
had pored over his bible now he bought
heathen charms the two things did not
seem to harmonize the incident awakened
fresh misgivings fed the old uneasiness

  wonder what ails findlay i said to
duncan when we were at last making our
way back to the ship away from the
fascinating life of the city

  he pondered awhile lifted his cap and
scratched his head

  i dont know he confessed he
seems sane enough whenever i happen to
see him i dont like it though i feel
in my bones that something is wrong
the mate wants me to report him to
the harbor commission i said

  dont you do it my lad do what
penny orders you to do-you have to do
that you know-but never do what he
asks you to do he is a cheap edition of
a man a sixpenny affair i never could
stand him since that time in calcutta
well said i i dont think findlay
is quite rational

we will watch him and if he goes off
his head entirely we will cable the owners
it never occured to the honest scotchman
that there might not be time for that
that something might happen suddenly

  it is all pennys business anyway
he grumbled irritably

  bombay was wonderful but too hot for
comfort i explored the city and the
environs and i watched the coolie dock-
hands struggle with the clumsy crated
printing-presses just as i had watched
the longshoremen at newcastle again
i felt a sharp disappointment

  i foresaw the time when the enchantment
of the east would become articulate would
become commonplace staring at one from
between the covers of books hardly were
the holds emptied before they were filled
again this time with rice for colombo
and chests of opium for hongkong

  bombay dropped behind sank slowly
below the horizon shrouded with palms
other beauties arose other pictures were
unveiled as beautiful as grand the
malabar coast was a revelation of soft
luxuriance a mute eloquent splendor the
palm-fringed coast the terraced table-land
and farther back lofty wooded hills and
with this a faint aroma a tropic languor
heat and a limpid blue sea

  captain findlay behaved strangely
captain findlays last voyage



possibly he wasnt mad yet-at least he
had moments of sanity-but if ever i saw
a hunted haunted man it was he i think
he realized his strange behavior and fought
against it blindly hopelessly he began
to read his bible again shut up in his cabin
with his charts and chronometers and that
picture on the wall somehow i could not
forget that picture it seemed to be a part
of this slow silent tragedy

  findlay was sick deathly sick-with fear
fear of madness and then at times the fear
of the other thing that i couldnt see a
phantom ship that seemed to pursue us
that he was always watching for and fleeing
from he seemed hardly to sleep most
of the night he spent on the bridge pacing
restlessly to and fro sometimes muttering
incoherently thinking aloud in snatches
and in these mutterings two names were
ever recurring estelle and martha
but generally he was silent brooding
melancholy

 only once did he speak to me directly
as usual in the dead of night he emerged
from his den and began to pace the deck
irresolutely with sporadic flashes of deter-
mination always scanning the sea with
painful vigilance suddenly he joined me
at my post ahead of the pilot-house his
eyes wandered from me to the ship to the
sky to the sea resting at last on the
distant retreating horizon

  how is it with your soul he asked in
low unearthly tones that conjured up
visions of death and damnation

 confused and irritated i murmured
something some stupid conventional re-
mark about not having thought of it
had no opinion in fact which was the truth
as far as it went

  a sailors life is full of dangers he said
hesitatingly as if reciting a half-forgotten
lesson we live today and are dead to-
morrow the sea the sky the wind are
alike our enemies aye even the hands of
man and god are raised against us i have
seen men aye and women aye and chil-
dren hale and hearty at sunset that never
lived to see the dawn of another day
prepare your soul young man before-
before-

 he broke off his eyes dilated and an
agonized whisper was wrung from his
lips

  there she is again god will she never
let me be

  you are mistaken sir i said oddly
stirred there is nothing there

  he looked at me his eyes abnormally
large and feverish wiped his forehead
with a trembling hand smiled a ghastly
smile like a soul in torment and left the
bridge

  what do you think of it i asked
duncan the morning of the day we were
due to arrive at colombo

  we were messing together before going
on duty he ate his bacon reflectively the
depth of his thoughts revealed by the
thoroughness of his chewing

  well he said finally the whole thing
is queer no doubt but after all nothing
has happened

  it gives one a mighty uncomfortable
feeling though said i

  i agree with you he admitted re-
luctantly i dont know why but it
seems to me that findlay is living two
lives sailing in two ships at the same time
that is when he is rational he commands
the aladdin and when he isnt-well-
quite normal he seems to think he has
charge of quite another ship it makes
a fellow lose his appetite

  he laid down his knife and fork dis-
gustedly

  i suppose i said we can put up
with it

it wont kill us at any rate-by the
way what is penny saying to you about it
nothing i suppose he is offended
since i didnt report the captain to that
commission at bombay

  well he has said a lot to me and i
shouldnt be surprised to hear he has been
pestering thompson too that fellow is
as cheap as his nickname and as brave as a
cuttlefish

  he was indignant he hauled out a
piece of tobacco bit into and tugged at it
energetically with his teeth

  i am not he continued as an after-
thought so sure id rather sail with a sane
man like penny for instance as skipper
than with a man like findlay though no
doubt he is crazy

  the coast of ceylon came nearer grew
magically green picturesque magnificent
washed by white surf at the shore low
rising gently to the abrupt slopes of verdure-
clad peaks its beauty screened by dense
jungle broken occasionally by inlets lead-
ing like gateways into the heart of the


adventure

enchantment crude native catamarans
with bamboo masts and cotton sails
scooted along the coast small thatched
huts hardly larger than dogs kennels
were disclosed in the jungle by the nearer
view

  suddenly the aladdin curved round a
palm-covered promontory and we entered
the harbor of colombo again the shock
of disappointment the loading and un-
loading vessels the smoke-belching tugs
the clamor the strife the mad rush of
trade but also the exquisite charm of
the east the domes and spires the gor-
geous temples for grotesque gods

  thompson was standing in the engine-
companion when i went forward after the
ship was moored to the wharf

  hello he called out shrilly do you
know what penny has been telling me
no i lied what has he been telling
you

he wants me to make a fool of myself
he says the captain is crazy and wants
me to notify the harbor authorities or
cable the king or something of that sort
well are you going to do it

  i am going to attend to my business
and that means taking care of the engines
in this ship and not reporting the captain
he walked forward with me

  penny only wants the command of the
ship anyway he continued and id
rather be hanged than help him he
expects some one else to do his dirty work
and get the glory himself-the sneak

  he swore viciously

after a week in port the alad-
din started on the last leg of her
long trip half-way around the globe
the coast of ceylon the palms the pictur-
esque rocks of the southern shore sank
into the ocean behind the lighthouse
of great bassas gleamed fitfully sleeplessly
in the night until that too disappeared
the heat was intense relentless in spite
of the monsoon in spite of the sea in spite
of the swift sure motion of the ship

  it was bearable for a well man but hell
and worse for the sick and captain
findlay was sick daily it became more
apparent more irremediable and we were
helpless we knew how to handle a ship
but a man like findlay-no-that we had
not learned the only remedy for illness
we knew was quinine and one cant admin-

ister quinine for a sick mind a mind haunted
by phantoms

  i have seen men in physical agony seen
them suffer seen them die but nothing
that i had seen before was so pitiful so
tormenting as this unfounded growing
terror in the captain it seemed to grip
his soul with inquisitorial mercilessness to
put it on the rack to quarter it it became
steadily worse nourished as it was by the
heat but still it did not kill

  the look of profound misery on his face
deepened became like a mask in fixedness
he ate little he slept not at all he read
his bible in the daytime without getting
any apparent comfort and spent his nights
on the bridge pacing back and forth rest-
lessly always searching the sea with
strained glowing eyes for long periods
he would remain silent then he would
talk incoherently fragmentarily about
estelle martha my wife and my
children the strong man babbled like
a child

  i was puzzled about estelle and
martha and their connection with my
wife and my children they were
always associated in his speech a con-
nection there was obscure but vital i
asked duncan he didnt know i asked
pennington he professed to be ignorant

  it was findlay himself who solved the
riddle partly at least he seemed more
cheerful that night though not more sane
he talked to me slowly confidentially
staring at me with bright feverish eyes
that sent chills crawling down my spine

  i was reading in the bible today
he said leaning over to me and i came
upon a great passage it said that those
that seek shall find it was immensely
comforting you know he lowered his
voice perceptibly you know i have my
wife along on this trip and my grand-
children alice and winton they are
marys children-mary is my daughter-
and they are going to england to go to
school

  but i have been much distressed lately
for the children are hiding from me i
cant find them i have been looking for
them a long time they are playing a
prank on their granddad the little beggars
i am worried about my wife too she
looks funny she looks just as she did
forty years ago when i first met her her
hair is combed straight back and she is
captain findlays last voyage



dressed in a large flounced crinoline-all
starched you know she is always with
me in my cabin but wont come out on
deck

 but i am worrying most about the
children they ought not to hide from me
i will find them though when we get to
england it wont take long the martha
is a good ship she will make it in six
weeks i will find them the bible says it
dont you think so

 yes i assented humoring him i
think you will sir

 the bible says it he repeated his
eyes wandering over the sea and be-
sides i have a charm

  he chuckled slyly

 he became silent and when he spoke
again he had forgotten my presence

 it was all a dream he whispered
my wife and children were not drowned
we were not run down that night in the
strait of singapore

 the mate was jubilant he considered
himself vindicated upheld by providence
his insolent mouth his bristling mustache
his blue watery eyes even his out-caving
legs assumed a what-did-i-tell-you attitude
he seemed to think that findlays madness
was due as a reparation for all he had
endured at the hands of the engineers

 his manners became exasperating atro-
cious he forgot everything but his own
perspicacity he cut his watches below
short so that he might parade his unpre-
possessing personality on deck the more
he made himself a nuisance an eve-sore
but he lacked the gumption to take the
command away from findlay

 the weather continued hot and the
captain continued to get worse that
haunting obsession became stronger it
occupied his mind dominated him he
became grayer thinner the fire of his eyes
more feverish he was an awesome yet
a pathetic figure a perpetual reminder of
mans changeful fate of the tyranny of
time and of memory and of the infectious
melancholy of the sea

 he was a monument an ironic monument
of life to life by life it was pitiful to see
him lose his mind but it was infinitely
worse to watch him lose his dignity the
respect of his crew he did finally and
it was by no means strange

  he seemed to be obsessed with the idea
that we were all going to die like a half-

crazed hell-and-damnation evangelist he
went about saying to the men in that
grave-like even voice of his

  how is it with your soul are you
ready to die

  his insistence on the subject was un-
canny demoralizing it gave us the creeps
to hear that patriarchal madman like a
uniformed jeremiah utter his doleful wo
wo to the superstitious sailors he was
a prophet of evil despised and feared it
broke down the discipline we had difficulty
handling the men

  i tried to save him once-but only once
afterward i thought it advisable to leave
him alone to pursue the road of his per-
verted fancies he was talking to the
man at the wheel that night i could hear
the sepulchral voice and that horror-
pervaded question

  how is it with your soul are you
ready to die

  sir i said impatiently determined
if possible to divert his attention from the
subject of death sir there is a ship
yonder

  i was not prepared for what followed
as if in a trance he came toward me his
face livid his eyes fixed and staring his
limbs atremble his lips moving can-
vulsively

  is it she he whispered hoarsely is
it the estelle of bristol why is she always
following me why cant she leave me
alone

  he broke down actually sobbed

  save us oh lord he prayed save us
its the children she wants she wants to
kill the little children may she be
damned damned damned

  he raised his clenched hands toward
heaven but in doing so his eyes fell upon
the steamer a german liner and he
dropped his arms again relieved as if his
prayer had been fulfilled and muttered
no no it isnt she not yet not
yet-

  it was with a deep sense of relief that
we entered the strait of malacca singa-
pore meant the end of the agony the
case would be reported investigated re-
ported again and when all the red tape
was exhausted finally settled it was
odious but preferable

  the malay peninsula emerged from the
sea coming nearer rising higher we saw
it first as a long dark streak then as a low


adventure

mountain range then as a dense impene-
trable jungle the coast was low and ugly
stretches of sandy beach dim foliage of
mangrove-swamps hideous mud-flats suc-
ceeding one another in a sordid dishearten-
ing panorama a slum of the magnificent
east

then the unforeseen happened
as it always will when all seems
well and safe something turns up
that entirely overthrows the firmest ex-
pectations as if providence delighted in
playing pranks with men in tormenting
them in letting them go their own ways
mold their own destiny until an expecta-
tion is assuming the guise of reality when
suddenly the incalculable factor appears
and in a moment destroys forever the
equation

  it was about four in the morning i
had just relieved pennington on the bridge
the captain was there as usual an in-
auspicious figure in white flannels pacing
the deck restlessly on the port side now
and then he stopped to stare into the water
the night was calm and clear the sky
bright the sea almost mirror-like we
swung into the strait of singapore its
long narrow reach lay like a river before us
an inland river with magnificent woods on
the banks

   the lights and the shadowy outline of a
steamer appeared in the darkness ahead of
us hugging the northern shore as far as
i could make out she was a ship of about
three thousand tons seemed heavily loaded
and moved at a rather slow speed a com-
mon type of freighter there was nothing
distinguishing about her and nothing inter-
esting

  i watched her idly she was a con-
venient object on which to rest my eyes
in comparison with the aladdin she was
abnormally clumsy she also seemed neg-
lected like an abused wife i remember
distinctly the last thought i had before
the commotion started i was thinking
that if i were aboard her i would have
her lanterns cleaned especially the one
forward on her masthead

  her course lay about a hundred yards
off our port side and she might have been
about two hundred and fifty yards ahead of
our bows when all suddenly a sharp com-
mand rang out behind me-

   starboard the helm

  i turned instantly doubting my hearing
a ship bearing down on our port side and
a command to starboard the helm it was
an insane order given by a madman of
course it was findlay but a different
findlay

  this man was not childish irresolute
full of fear any longer terror evidently
had at last shocked him into determination
the spirit of his better days had arisen to
reinforce his frenzy he was formidable
that night he was dangerous i felt it
and the sailor at the wheel felt it

  aye aye sir he said and actually
swung the ship over a point or two

   hold your course i roared and turning
shouted to the man on the forecastle head
to call the mate

  but findlay would not give in he was
dominated by his single mad idea snatch-
ing a hatchet from the pilot-house wall he
brandished it aloft like a medieval warrior
and shouted in stentorian tones

  i will save my ship i will save my
ship and exultantly-i have her at
last she shant kill the children she shant
pursue me any more

  the wheelsman terrified in fear of his
life ducked away and fled down on the
lower deck findlay grabbed the wheel
and swung it over he had dropped the
ax i jumped at him he was strong
however stronger than i had thought
i expected him to weaken to back away
but he didnt he fought we struggled
madly and even as we struggled i knew
the ship was obeying her rudder turning
across the channel heading for the vul-
nerable side of the other ship i tried to
break away made a rush for the wheel
but stumbled

   a terrific blow hit me in the face flusli
on the jaw and the next instant i sprawleci
on the deck dazed helpless but stili
somehow able to think to imagine things
i knew the other ship could not suspeci
the truth when she noticed our altered
course she would swerve over try to gt
nearer the shore and expose her entire side
i tried to get up but couldnt

   i could think i could plan but my limb
refused to obey my nerves seemed para-
lyzed the agony increased each moment
each fraction of a moment brought a fullei
realization of the impending tragedy ii
seemed a horrible dream but i knew it wa
the terrible truth
inducement



  then there was a moment eternal it
seemed of still intensity of maddening
suspense of growing horror a voice
shrieked into the night-

 are you mad

 a siren shrilled then a deafening
crash a rending of steel plates

  the impact threw me against the railing
in front the shock restored me somewhat
i rose unsteadily and scrambled to the
wheel i signaled the engine-room for full
speed ahead i had but one thought to
keep the nose of the aladdin in the side
of the other ship until she sank there
was a wild scramble down on the deck
curses cries orders-and findlay i shall
never forget it
he stood near the starboard life-boat
in his spotless but somewhat wrinkled white
uniform his sallow upturned face and bald
head gleaming white and ghastly like a
dead mans his arms stretched outward
and upward as if in rapturous prayer
then he began to chant slowly solemnly-
the doxology i hope i shall never hear it
again under such circumstances the
bustle the cries the curses and then that
solemn chant-

  praise god from whom all blessings
flow-

  it was ludicrous and awful

  finally he stopped dropped his arms
to his sides and i heard him pray wearily
but distinctly-

  now let thy servant depart in peace

  he went aft hesitatingly and disap-
peared forever a sailor said afterward
that he had seen him at the taffrail and
that later he had heard a splash

  the strange ship sank slowly the
aladdin clung to her side tenaciously like
an obstinate bulldog but at last she
foundered the yawning hole back of her
funnel would not be denied her crew
was safe aboard the aladdin we backed
away and stood by watching her go
down

  first she listed over to port lay there
irresolutely for a moment then she dis-
appeared swiftly her masthead lights stick-
ing out of the sea forlornly long after the
hull had vanished

  but as she glided down into the water
her after part rose high in the air and i saw
in the sheen of the water and the glow of
the stars her name written in large letters
over her stern it was the estelle of
bristol

  call it chance if you like but i call it

thoroughfare were called north riverside
and south riverside

  the less fortunate lived in scrupulously
clean honeysuckle-bordered little houses
that climbed the two slopes of the valley
in a very orderly fashion a dozen manu-
facturing plants on the river below town
furnished employment for those who had
to work with their hands the wealthy of
westover owned those plants

  when the five years were almost gone
peter huntley left indiana and started
back to tennessee to see whether his
marian had forgotten he feared she
had a girl of eighteen he told himself
was too young to make promises covering
five years of time

  peter arrived in westover at noontime
on the fateful day when he had had
luncheon at the inn he dressed himself
smartly all in white save for a gray norfolk
coat and set out for a great sycamore tree
that stood on the rivers north bank at the
upper edge of town all along the main
avenue he met people whom he instantly
recognized but none of them recognized
him even old judge urhart who had
known him exceedingly well stared at
him blankly as he bowled past in a purring
six-cylinder car

  huntley reached the shrine of his boyhood



f here is nothing that a man may
hate so bitterly and at the same
tme lve so devotedly as his home
town young peter huntley hated
westover because it had named him a
ruffian and a brawler when he was only a
good and quick fighter and because it had
fleeced his father of the price of a mag-
nificent plantation he loved westover
because it was the home of his boyhood
and of the sweetheart who had agreed to
wait for him for five years without even an
exchange of letters

  huntley had asked for five years in
which to make something of himself no
letters were to be exchanged because all
westover postmasters were tools of judge
urhart who was marians father and the
big boss of the entire county

  westover was a beautiful little city
along a crystal-clear river it lay in a
rather narrow valley it had many stately
old maples and many handsome old resi-
dences in the warmer months it was a
veritable fairyland of roses and lilies and
honeysuckles there was hardly a middle
class most of the people by far were
either rich or poor all the former lived
on an avenue an eighth of a mile broad
through the center of which the sparkling
river flowed the halves of this pretty
the man who whipped a city



an hour before the appointed time and
sat down on a stone to wait the old
sycamore was to him the same gaunt good
friend it had been in his earlier youth the
only change he noticed was that the initials
and the date he had cut in the white bark
exactly five years before were now grown
over and dim peter rose took out his
knife and renewed the letters and
figures

  then he sat down and began to watch
his gold repeater religiously he tried to
prepare himself for disappointment by
saying over and over

  a girl of eighteen doesnt know herself
i neednt hope its silly

  and each time there came like an echo
this from his memory

  if im alive peter ill meet you here
at three oclock five years from today
when at last his watch told him it was
three he rose disheartenedly though
he had tried hard to brace himself for the
blow he hadnt done it it staggered him
he became bitter what a fools paradise
he had been living in all women were
like that of course not only this woman
but all women   

  there was the sound of dragging foot-
steps out to his right and his heart paused
in its beating he half turned and
looked

  marian

  and then he stood aghast at that which
he saw it was marian who stood there
before him but it was not the marian
that he had known the other marian
had been supple and roundish bright-eyed
and laughing full of life as a robin pretty
as a dawn in june this girl was death-
white and pitifully thin she was like the
ghost of the other marian

  ive had typhoid peter she explained
in a voice that he barely heard peter
dear she went on in the same weak voice
i told you id be here to meet you at three
this afternoon if i were alive didnt i
well i am here but im afraid youll
have to carry me back i got out of bed
and stole away-i could hardly dress
myself-peter i didnt forget my promise

to you--

  she was in his arms long before she
finished speaking then she collapsed
huntley was a strong man he carried her
as he would have carried a baby only
more tenderly and as he went down the

river he swore at himself because he had
doubted that she would come

  when he reached the big brick and
granite home of judge urhart and his
daughter the neighborhood had been
alarmed by the nurse word had been
telephoned to marians father and he was
just arriving with the doctor beside him
in his automobile huntley carried the
limp figure to a bed the nurse showed him
and put it down carefully the doctor
stepped to the bedside and at that moment
the girl opened her eyes

   im all right now she said

  urhart hastily questioned the nurse

  she must have been delirious the
white-clad woman told them she sent
me on an errand and went out while i was
gone

  urhart seemed satisfied with the explana-
tion but the doctor narrowed his gaze
and shook his head

  she was getting along so well he
muttered i dont see how she could
be delirious at this stage

  after receiving assurance that his daugh-
ter was not much the worse for her exertion
urhart motioned to huntley to follow and
then led the way to the library the old
ex-judge was a tall lean man with mutton-
chop whiskers a sharp profile and a hard
mouth in the library he turned upon
huntley with a frown that would have
disconcerted a lesser man

  whom he asked have i to thank for
this service

  dont you know me judge smiled
peter

  that smile was like pulling front teeth
but the other happened to be marians father

  im peter huntley

  the older man had not forgotten-and
indeed few other westoverites had for-
gotten-the youthful peccadilloes of peter
huntley whom they had named a brawler
and a ruffian because he had fought so
much but now urhart forced himself to
appear both grateful and glad to see hunt-
ley they shook hands the rather
strained situation was relieved a few
minutes later by the abrupt entrance of
the urhart family physician

  miss urhart wishes to see the gentleman
who brought her back he said

  she wishes to thank you personally
huntley the girls father chose to believe
go on
adventure

another minute found huntley
in marians room when she saw
him marian smiled and pointed
to a chair

  draw it up peter she invited and
sit down

  peter did so he bent toward her
maybe you shouldnt talk marian
ive got to peter a little now tell
me about yourself tell me what you did
in those five years

  first huntley began i tried to make
a business man of myself but i couldnt
do it it made me fidgety to sit still all
the time then i went in for electricity
i am now a very capable electrical engineer
are you- he glanced toward the nurse and
whispered this-very much disappointed
marian smiled

  oh no peter listen you can get a
position here maybe you see were
putting in a dam and power-plant four
miles up the river its to be municipally
owned and controlled the city floated a
hundred thousand in bonds for it fathers
at the head of it hes mayor of westover
again see father get the place and-
in a whisper-try to make him like you
well enough to give us his permission-
im tired peter-ill have to let you go

the nurse isnt looking peter-

  huntley kissed her slyly bade her good-
by and hurried back to the library old
urhart seemed displeased at the length of
his stay

  your daughter peter explained was
telling me about the new dam and power-
plant

  westovers big boss brightened at once
its going to make money for us hunt-
ley you see were going to furnish juice
to two other towns besides this every-
thing is nearly ready now by the time
we can locate a good engineer to take charge
of the plant--

  im your man huntley interrupted
he couldnt help it im a first-class
electrical engineer if i do say it myself
and ill work for you and old westover
just a little cheaper than id work for
anybody else

  for a moment urhart seemed at a loss
to know what to say at last he blurted
youll have to see alden huntley
hes the contractor and he is to find the
electrician you remember farnsworth
alden of course

  at the mention of the name the younger
mans face clouded certainly he remem-
bered farnsworth alden contractor
alden had been one of the chief men of
that ring that had robbed his good old
father to the very bone of him-it had
been done mostly within the law but to
the bone just the same

  huntley controlled his feelings as well
as he could and told judge urhart good-by
for the time being

  he was undecided as to just what he
was going to do he believed that marians
father would see that he did not get the
position he wanted simply because he was
peter huntley moreover he very heartily
disliked having to ask a job of a man whom
he detested as he detested farnsworth
alden the huntleys had a high old pride
in them and peter had as much of it as any
of the rest

  he went back to the inn changed his
clothes and shortly afterward boarded a
train for a neighboring town to visit his
parents he found his father running a
little grocery store almost at a loss because
of the big heart he had in him

  when the evening meal was over the
three of them father and mother and son
gathered in the sitting-room though it
was in june the evening had fallen with a
chill which was due to a recent rain and
there was a fire in the grate old john
huntley lay back in his armchair and
stared silently and thoughtfully into the
glowing coals his wife sat beside him
and on the floor at her feet sat peter who
to her was a far greater person than a mere
king

  i wish youd tell me dad peter said
suddenly exactly how westover fleeced
you id like to know all about-the
details you know

  id much rather not go over it peter
was the quick reply

  almost immediately afterward john
huntley made an excuse to leave the room
when the door had closed behind him
mrs huntley bent forward and put a
tender hand on peters dark-brown head

  you touched a sore spot when you
mentioned that son said she he cant
bear to even think about it and if i were
not your mother you probably wouldnt
believe me when i tell you the reason
its his great disappointment in humanity
peter he went to westover a gentleman
the man who whipped a city



and he took it for granted that farnsworth
alden and the others were gentlemen too
he trusted them too far

  as to their methods of getting our
money she went on they induced him
to build a number of dwelling-houses a
storehouse and a factory and they loaned
him about half of the necessary money
then the alden-urhart bank failed very
shrewdly and the crash came but your
fathers lack of business sense was partly
to blame he was a gentleman planter
and not a business man

  the thing i tried hardest to forgive is
this peter alden and judge urhart-the
judge peter was in it too-found certain
scoundrelly enemies of ours who were glad
to swear in court that they wouldnt believe
your fathers oath this was when he en-
tered suit to try to regain something of that
which we had lost

  it was fortunate for her peace of mind
perhaps that she couldnt see her sons
face when she had finished speaking it
was so white that it looked ghastly in the
ruddy firelight judge urhart had done
that his marians father had done that
unspeakable thing

  sitting there at his mothers knee there
at the first altar of life big young peter
huntley told himself firmly that those
who had wronged his father must make all
the amends possible it had to be done
for his fathers sake to restore his fathers
faith in humanity there was not the
tiniest scrap of cheap red vengeance con-
nected with it

  for he knew that a man no matter how
good who had lost his faith in his fellows
was little better than dead 

on the following day peter
huntley went back to the west-
over that he had both loved and
hated he meant to put his pride in irons
so to speak and see farnsworth alden
immediately to ask for the position at the
new power-plant he would accept it at
any salary that would give him a reason
for being in westover he could then work
at the gigantic task of righting the wrong
unsuspected if it were necessary he did
not yet know how he was going to under-
take that task but he did know that he
was going to undertake it

  peter walked up the river to the dam
four miles is no distance for such a man

as peter huntley-who never smoked and
never drank and who slept eight hours
every night the little journey required
but an hour of his time

  alden was not there when he arrived
and he began to look over the work the
dam was about three-fourths finished
the power-plant was all ready except for
the setting up of the switchboards and
the adjustment of the turbines and gen-
erators and when huntley had seen all
there was to see every nerve in him was
tingling because of a most amazing dis-
covery that he had made that discovery
was this

   the material of the dam contained less
than half the percentage of cement it
should have had to make it safe the
power-plant was cheaply erected the
machinery turbines and generators and
all was second-hand and of old types and
painted and polished to deceive inex-
perienced eyes

   marian urhart had acquainted him with
the fact that a hundred thousand dollars
of the peoples money was going into the
project but it was not really costing
much more than fifty thousand-the same
ring that had robbed his father was now
preparing to rake down at least forty
thousand in graft

   the fools said huntley to himself when
the truth had fully dawned theyve
built this rotten sand dam above the town
instead of below-and the first high water
is sure to break it and the town will be
swept away peter huntley knew he
added - id have thought alden had
better judgment than hes shown here sure

   but alden was essentially a builder of
buildings and not a builder of dams

   the contractor arrived in his six-cylinder
runabout half an hour later instead of
huntleys finding him he found huntley
he was a big and pudgy ruddy-faced man
and his countenance was peculiar in that
it was both piggish and shrewd

   whats your business here he wanted
to know

   there was a hostile light in his pale gray
eyes

   im looking for an electricians job
was the very prompt answer judge
urhart suggested that i see you

  is your name huntley

   alden like most of the other westover-
ites had failed to recognize him


adventure

  peter huntley i can get fine letters of
recommendation from two big indiana
corporations and ill take the place at a
very reasonable figure you see westover
is my home town

  youre too late farnsworth alden said
sourly ive got a man coming from vir-
ginia if youve no further business with

  he had lied he had no man coming
from virginia and the other knew it
huntley went white with anger alden
might have remembered that the big
young man there before him had been a
quick fighter all his life but he didnt
with a burning insolence he went on
youd better be going weve got noth-
ing here for you

  they were standing on the rivers bank
just below the new building huntley
took a step forward and seized aldens
coat lapel

  but ive got something for you you

-grafter he growled and its this

im going to tell the people of westover
of your graft scheme im going to tell
them all about this rotten dam that will
be a constant menace to them about the
old and worn-out machinery about every-
thing and im also going to wire the
states committee on public safety you
may hoodwink people who dont know
anything about dams and power-plants
but you sure cant hoodwink the authori-
ties-you lying stealing villainous grafter
farnsworth alden went guiltily purple
graft scheme he throated hunt-
ley youre crazy

  oh am i

  the younger mans smile was white and
dangerous

  i know something about graft schemes
crazy or not the rest of the ring lets the
contract to you for a hundred thousand
it costs you sixty with a handsome profit
in that for yourself then you split the
remaining forty with the rest of the ring
its polite robbery which is on a par with
holy murder would you mind telling me
just how much i missed it in my figures
mr farnsworth alden

  if only he had thought of marian he
would have been more careful but he
didnt think alden had called his hand
and he had been too intensely human to
resist the temptation of showing that it
was a big one

  alden had by this time recovered his
presence of mind

  what do you know about machinery and
dams he roared he really believed the
dam would hold in any water you
scapegrace i remember the reputation you
used to have in westover do you think
i would put a man like you in charge of
this plant not on your life about the
first thing we knew youd be entering suit
against us like your whining father-

that was as far as he was per-
mitted to go with it peter hunt-
ley struck the sneering fat mouth
so hard that he knocked out two teeth and
splintered a bone in his hand alden
reeled backward and before he could fall
huntley had driven home another blow
this sent him into the river which was
shoulder-deep at that point he came up
puffing and sputtering huntley blind
with the pent-up anger of years sprang
to the water and hammered the pudgy
piggish face again

  but in all that he had been unwise
he had but let himself fall into a trap that
the resourceful alden had laid for him-
but alden it is safe to say hadnt dreamed
that he would fall so quickly and so hard

  the grafting contractor had been cor-
nered tight he saw the state peni-
tentiary looming gray ahead of him the
easiest way out of that corner was to goad
huntley to fight him and then have hunt-
ley tried and imprisoned on a charge of
assault a ring magistrate would do it

  once in the westover jail the trouble-
maker would have no opportunity to com-
municate with the state authorities or
alarm the populace within two weeks
the dam would be finished and therefore
proof against investigations and the people
would be too well pleased with their elec-
trically-lighted town to pay any attention
to a howler of calamity

  a score of workmen rushed to their
employers aid they dragged him gasp-
ing for breath from the water huntley
calmly waded out and began to look for
his hat which he had lost

  hold him thickly blustered alden
hold that man-hes a lunatic-he must
be arrested

  half a dozen men ran to huntley and
clapped their sand-plastered hands on his
shoulders and arms
the man who whipped a city



  keep off peter ordered sharply throw-
ing them aside

  hold him i say cried alden

  at that the men a round twelve of them
this time sprang determinedly upon hunt-
ley there was a lively struggle but it
lasted for less than a minute one man
especially if he be handicapped by a shat-
tered finger-bone can not hope to hold his
own long against a dozen sturdy laborers

  they tied huntleys hands behind him
and one of them struck him brutally at the
enraged contractors command when he
protested then they bound him hard and
fast in aldens runabout and alden
whisked him to westover and to magis-
trate gurlands office without arousing
the notice of the people

  immediately after a hastily whispered
conference between farnsworth alden and
the magistrate peter was given a semblance
of a trial there was small need of wit-
nesses gurland said the contractors still
bleeding face furnished all the evidence
necessary huntley endeavored to present
his side of the affair but a deputy-sheriff
promptly hushed him

  assault with intent to kill droned
the magistrate eleven months and
twenty-nine days

  the deputy started away with his pris-
oner alden bent toward magistrate gur-
land and whispered a reminder

  in solitary confinement added gur-
land watch him hes dangerous

  into the dingiest most dismal cell of the
westover jail went well-dressed peter
huntley and the heavy lock clicked behind
him this cell was in the jails basement
and the only light it had struggled in
through a horizontally narrow barred
window set on a level with the ground
outside and facing a blank stone fence

  the only furniture was a wooden box
and a narrow and musty-smelling bed on
the whitewashed wall opposite the iron door
some former occupant of that solitary cell
had whimsically written with a piece of
charcoal

visitors must not feed or annoy the
animals

  began for peter a series of days and
nights that were full of that acute misery
that any manner of confinement brings to
live and red-blooded men no privileges

whatever were granted him save those of
going three times a day always under the
close guard that is sent with the most
untrustworthy criminals to the lavatory
and then to the eating-room

  he tried to buy the sheriff and the jailer
but his money wouldnt touch them he
tried to tell them about the dangerous
dam-for marians sake he refrained from
mentioning the graft scheme-but they
had been warned in advance that his mind
was twisted on such questions as those of
power-plants and dams

  peter grew sullen and his face became
darkened with a stubby beard and lean
but never for a moment did he give up his
aims or lose hope though it required in him
the indomitable courage of a superman

  all along he had been wondering whether
marian knew of his incarceration she
would come to see him when she was able
to be out he was sure if she had learned of
his plight

  but marian didnt know of it the
grafting ring had taken care that very
very few knew of it peter had guessed
too shrewdly in the figures he had presented
to alden just before the assault

  three weeks from the date on which the
iron door swung shut between huntley
and liberty the dam was completed and
the high tension wires were connected with
the distributing station the streets and
almost every house in westover had been
wired and made ready the evening that
saw the town flooded with electric light
was a time of general rejoicing the band
played speeches were made in the court-
house the populace cheered wildly down
in his dungeon-like cell peter heard some-
thing of it dimly and he understood

  a month passed and during those four
weeks the stores stopped handling kerosene
and most of the people foolishly threw away
their oil lamps and used the oil they had for
building fires

  also during that month a scourging
epidemic of typhoid struck the town

  there is nothing on earth i think quite
so uncertain as tennessees weather on
the last day of july it began to rain hard
and steadily for hours upon hours it
rained and the river began to rise peter
huntley began to rave about the dam it
was enough considering the wear of his
solitary confinement to drive him insane

  the jailer refused to listen peter then
io

adventure

  tried to shout his warning through the little
  window the jailer threatened to gag him
  if he didnt close his mouth of his own
  accord

   all right agreed peter but first
 let me say this if there is such a thing as
 reincarnation youre the same damned
 scoundrel that stuck the spear into the side
 of the man they crucified

    the keeper of the keys laughed and went
 off whistling peter began to pace the
 dank floor he kept himself from thinking
 of being drowned there in his cell by think-
 ing of his marian how he hoped that she
 would escape the devastating flood wall
 that he knew had to come

   night fell thick the street electrics
 made only dim white circles in the misty
 darkness two hours and something failed
 at the power-plant-and westover with its
 scores of cases of typhoid was plunged into
 impenetrable stygian blackness

judge urhart tried to sit up
in the smothering night and found
that he was too weak he lay back
pillow waited and listened impa-
tiently a few minutes later he heard his
daughters soft footsteps in the near-by
hallway she came slowly groping feel-
ing her way with her hands

   what did the engineer say he wanted
 to know

   the telephone worked badly at first
 and i didnt get it all said marian halting
 beside his bed theres something wrong
 with-the generators i believe he said
 maybe the lights will come on soon i hope
 so for this is terrible i wish peter hunt-
 ley were in charge up there father its a
 shame that mr alden wouldnt give him
 the position

 ive already heard too much of peter
 huntley weakly declared the mayor of
 westover

 if only we knew where to find him
the girl continued do you suppose his
parents in faidleysville would know did
he-are you sure he didnt say where he
was going when he left

  i-er i dont believe he did

 the old ex-judge was too sick to lie
outright very easily

 the night wore on and the typhoid
sufferers suffered on in the blackness the
coming of eleven oclock found half the
women in westover hysterical by mid-

night the hearts of some very strong men
were being harassed by that unrelenting
darkness

   farnsworth alden had been kept busy
answering telephone calls for hours now
he knew that something had to be done
and that done quickly to get the generators
to working again the stricken town had
to have light he thought of asking peter
huntleys aid but he doubted seriously
that huntley would turn over a hand for
him in his dilemma he decided to go
to the resourceful judge urhart for advice
marian met him at the door

   its alden he said shakily ive got
 to talk with your father please take me
 to him-and let me hold to your arm
 marian i stumble badly in this darkness
 he had been drinking in an attempt to
 settle his nerves

   you mustnt worry him remember
warned the girl

   she led him to her fathers bedroom
when they were inside the door alden
announced himself then he requested that
marian leave him with her father for a few
minutes

  marian pretended to withdraw-and
didnt

   well said urhart impatiently

   do you think you could get huntley
to go to the power-plant began alden
maybe he could give us light weve
got to have light

   after your treatment of him urhart
said sourly he wouldnt go this is
a sort of unholy vengeance for him you
mustnt forget that hes been lying there in
jail for some two months nursing a griev-
ance

   you sanctioned it alden replied half
 angrily you were as deep in the graft
 scheme as anybody else

   marians two hands clutched her dress
at her throat peter in jail for two months
a graft scheme in the twinkling of an
eye her intuition told her almost the whole
story she knew about the ruining of
peters father she might not have known
just how it had been brought about but
all the same she knew

   mr alden came her troubled voice
from the doorway please stay here with
father until the nurse wakes-shes worn
out peter huntley will go to the dam for
me i know

   without waiting for a reply without
the man who whipped a city



 waiting to ask her fathers permission she
 hastened for a wrap and went toward the
 garage which stood just behind the house
 three minutes later she was at the wheel
 of the big touring-car and driving at a rapid
 rate toward westovers jail the glare of
 the headlights showed her that the rain
 had ceased

  at the jail she demanded entrance in her
fathers name the jailer had found a
candle he opened the strong front door
and held the flickering light above his
head

  oh its you miss marian is any-
thing-

  she interrupted sharply

  im going to take peter huntley to the
dam to straighten out things there-release
him and hurry

  she stepped inside the door to wait the
keeper of the keys telephoned to the urhart
residence and after a considerable wait
farnsworth alden answered it would be
all right said alden to send huntley to
the power-plant but a guard should accom-
pany him

  the jailer hastened to the basement and
unlocked the door of the solitary cell

 come out he began they want
you--

  he broke off short because the light of
his candle showed him that the prisoner
was gone huntleys bed he noted had
been demolished then he saw huntley
had used one of its strong railings as a means
of prying out two of the narrow windows
rusted bars

  marian was not disappointed when she
heard of it rather she was pleased

  hes gone to the dam she declared

  id bet all ive got that he hasnt
replied the jailer

  marian ignored that theres a good
road all the way up there im going up
to see if i can help him in any way-please
phone mr alden and ask him to tell
father

  with that she almost ran from the jail
and soon she was driving at a twenty-mile
clip along the smooth pike that led up the
river

  the plant was lighted when she caught
sight of it but that came from storage
batteries of course she drew up beside
the road sprang from the machine and
hurried across the few rods that lay between
it and the big brick building

u

on the main floor she found peter
huntley working like mad over one
of the old generators he was
grimy and his clothing was soiled and
untidy and his face was thin and almost
black with beard except for the fine brave
glow in his eyes he had the appearance of
a tramp marian suppressed a sob of pity
when she saw him

  for a long half-hour she stood there and
watched him while he wrestled with dis-
connected field wires and worn-out bearings
he was too intent upon his task to see
anything else finally he finished the
work and then he gave a signal to the
sawmill engineer who called himself an
electrical engineer because he had taken a
short correspondence course in electricity

  ready wildman he said

  the sallow little man put the big machine
in motion and a steady humming sound
came from it then he ran to the breaker
and threw the current on-and the stricken
town below had light

  peter cried marian

  huntley looked around and saw her
she was radiant with perfect health again
prouder than ever of him heart-broken with
sympathy for him he went toward her
with a happy light on his bearded face then
he stopped because he felt himself unfit to
touch her she understood she took one
of his grimy hands and pressed it to her
breast

  poor old peter she sobbed i-i
didnt know they told me you had gone
then father sent me to a mountain resort
to recuperate im so very sorry peter

  listen marian said huntley his
voice grave and hollow the river has
been three feet higher than it is now and
the dam held but the river is now rising
again from heavy rains on its headwaters
and if it gets higher than it was before
i believe the dam will break let me look
at the gage again-

  he turned and ran a minute later he
was back and he was excited

  its almost as high as it was before
he told her i want you to tell that fool
town down there about it they wouldnt
believe me telephone-tell central to
warn the people to take their sick ones
and get clean out of the valley and have
central instruct them to leave all lights on
and when the dam breaks well flash the
lights three times as a warning that will
adventure

give the foolish ones some twenty minutes
to get to safety in there- he stretched
a finger unsteadily toward the plants little
office-is a phone

  marian transferred his message almost
verbatim half an hour later every soul
in westover had received the warning the
typhoid sufferers were wrapped in blankets
and carefully carried to houses that stood
high and above the danger-line those
who were incredulous enough to remain in
their threatened homes were not fortu-
nately incredulous enough to put out their
lights neither did they go to sleep

  the sawmill engineer stood at his post
before the current-breaker ready to flash
the signal in westover huntley stood at
an open window that faced the dam and
beside him was marian with her gaze upon
the muddy foam-dotted and debris-covered
waters below she had wanted to return to
her father but huntley wouldnt permit it
the road to westover lay in the valley all
the way down and it was too hazardous

  peter she murmured when she had
wrung from him a confirmation of her sus-
picions and knew everything peter i
hope the dam will break almost
marian

  almost i said for then you will have
whipped your home town which ruined
your gentleman father and called you a
villain when you fought for your rights
the town you both love and hate the
engineer isnt looking if you can take
your eyes off that dam for a second you
may kiss me peter dear

he did it just then the droning
miserere of the mad waters widened into
a far-reaching gushing roar and with it
came the grinding jar of stone upon stone
peter whirled

  break the current he bellowed
break it once-twice-again-good
wildman

  with the knowledge that he had suc-
ceeded in saving the little city he was to
hate no longer reactionary weakness over-
powered him and he sank to the floor
the solitary cell had taken its toll at last

  they hurried him to his fathers home in
faidleysville and the people of a whole
county hung upon tidings concerning his

condition as though it were a matter of life
or death to them peter got well soon

  save for a thorough wetting westover
was not very badly damaged by the
flood the waters had spread and thereby
lost much of their force by the time they
had gone the four miles and only a few
houses were swept from their foundations
fortunately those buildings directly in the
path of the current were of brick or stone

when the cleaning-up was over
and the people were pretty close to
happiness again westovers mayor
called a meeting of certain men in the libra-
ry of his home when they were all there
judge urhart rose beside his littered desk
and addressed them with a peculiar glint in
his eyes

  gentlemen he began we are here
tonight to organize the business mens
league of westover the league is going
to begin its business by doing these things

  first its going to pay old john huntley
back all he lost to us second its going
to build a hundred thousand dollars worth
of dam and power-plant on the river below
the city-and the job is going to be put
into the hands of peter huntley the man
to whom westover owes its life third
its going to stand behind all the bigger
damage done by the flood

  he spoke with an air of finality he
was still the big boss and yet there was
one man of those present who dared to
criticize him that man was farnsworth
alden

  i have just read he sneered the
wedding announcement

  judge urhart went white and stared hard

  that has nothing whatever to do with
it its gratitude you hog peter hunt-
ley whipped me farnsworth a little harder
than he whipped you only he did it in a
different way if you refuse to do your part

by this amende honorable by - sir

youll go to prison i may have to go with
you but take my word for it youll go
i am waiting for your decision right now
sir

  oh i-ill not refuse replied alden

  whereupon judge urhart took his right
hand from his right hip-pocket

    vrowded with warriors in the
fantastic armor of medieval japan
jvr a long line of junks and sampans
rounded the southwest tip of the
korean peninsula and headed north along
the deserted coast of that war-tortured
country so inappropriately called the
land of the morning calm sent forth
upon the seas by the edict of hideyoshi
the cesar of japan-who like his roman
prototype was uncrowned king of a con-
quering empire-they bore eager reenforce-
ments to the hundred and ninety thousand
veterans who were crashing through the
rotten framework of the korean kingdom
as a stone crashes through a paper lantern

  hideyoshis land campaigns were drawing
to a triumphant close there remained only
to debark these reeinforcements for kon-
ishis army which was holding the new-
captured city of pyeng-yang it was the
summer of  before autumn hide-
yoshi would have the peninsula safe behind
him as a base and source of supplies for
his intended conquest of china

  kurushima daimio or lord of tosa led
the fleet with a picked squadron manned
by his own hardy fishermen-veteran sea-
fighters every man their long rakish
craft mere open rowboats though they
were were known and feared from luzon
to the china coast the largest foe that
sailed the seas shrank from encountering

them pulling alongside they would board
and carry all before them with the trenchant
edges of their terrible swords

  once at pyeng-yang they would land
and join in the dash on nanking with
which the conquest of china was to begin
kurushimas stern soul yearned for the
wind to bear them thither where there
waited adventuring enough even for his
ardent spirit there would be huge armies
to overthrow great cities to storm the
vastest kingdom in the world to seize and
rule as for the koreans-they were to
him as the crushed oyster-shells that paved
the road to his castle-gate he was com-
posing a verse on this thought when a
startled cry from the helmsman wiped it
from his mind his alert eyes focused
on the sea ahead

  from behind the lee of han-san island
shot such a thing as the world had never
yet seen it was manifestly a ship-but
what a ship the japanese stared as at
some incredible monster she was covered
with an iron roof a curved deck of iron
plates shaped like the back of a tortoise
there was neither sail nor mast beneath
the protecting overhang of the iron deck
the oars of many rowers urged her forward
at stupefying speed a hideous dragons
head with wide-open jaws glared horribly
above the bows a raised oar in the stern
bore the flaming standard of admiral


adventure

yi sun-sin the great sea-fighter and in-
ventor of korea

  as the japanese gazed with open eyes
and mouths the dragons jaws spat smoke
and flame and a heavy cannon-ball tore
through the crowded waist of one of kuru-
shimas junks the shrieks of the wound-
ed rang piteously but through and above
them beat a thunderous yell of defiance
from the whole japanese fleet tall nar-
row banners bright with the insignia of a
hundred fighting feudal chiefs were waved
on high from junks and sampans swords
spears and halberds glistened in the sun
the archers of japan bent their seven-foot
bows and a storm of burning fire-arrows
flew through the air

  but the thick shafts flew in vain for they
only rebounded from the tortoise-boats
iron deck and fell hissing into the sea
matchlock-men fired their shot but the
balls glanced from the koreans iron plates
with a sound like that of hail-stones on
a metal roof

  if we too had cannon- cried kuru-
shimas helmsman but the daimio cut
him short

  why should we use the weapons of
cowards he exclaimed we have not
needed them on the land why on the sea
the sword is the soul of the samurai 

  it was his favorite proverb and now he
and his men in open boats were ready to
put their trust in the sword even against
an ironclad

  by this time the monster was right
among them besides the dragon-mouth
forward there were six similar embrasures
on each side and another aft burning to
come to hand-grips the japanese pressed
up in their swarming open boats striving
to close and board but one after another
they were shattered by crashing broad-
sides between broadsides while the
korean gun-crews rammed home fresh
charges the bowmen beside them shot
fire-arrows into the crowded vessels of
japan the wooden hulls caught fire
easily and several were soon ablaze

  an abortive cheer rang out as one daring
sampan carrying a company of eager
men-at-arms pulled squarely athwart the
tortoise-boats bows but the cheer died
as the koreans long sharp ram cut her
in two as if the sampan had been a straw
spilling her swordsmen into the sea with
unchecked speed the ironclad passed over

the swirl where her brave enemy had been
brained the struggling swimmers with her
swinging oars and rammed the largest
junk in the japanese fleet her side
crushed in at the water-line the junk heeled
over filled and went down with all on
board as the tortoise-boat backed away
and started for a fresh victim

  through the length of the entire fleet
the ironclad tore her way mangling helpless
sampans with her terrible beak sinking
great junks with the fearful balls from her
well-directed cannon with frantic cour-
age the japanese bore in hoping against
hope for a chance to board and avenge
their butchered comrades but all was in
vain the tortoise forced a path through
them all and sped on toward the south
as if sated with destruction

  undaunted her surviving enemies put
about doubling on their former course
and hastened to pursue their now fleeing
foe soon the japanese squadron was
strung out in a long scattering line ahead
as the speedier of tbem outdistanced their
laboring fellows but not even the swiftest
held its own with the tortoise-boat whose
well-modeled racing hull beneath the over-
hanging gun-deck gave the lie to her name
on they pressed pursuers and pursued
oars churning the water white till the
japanese line was punctured with great
gaps

  suddenly the ironclads speed slackened
her oars trailed idly with loud shouts of
banzai the leading japanese bore down
upon her when barely two ships lengths
separated them the korean oars struck
the water again but with a difference
admiral yi sun-sin had built his vessel
alike at both ends he had ordered his
rowers to face about and what had been
the stern of the tortoise-boat was now
her bow hardly had his nonplused
pursuers realized the maneuver when the
ironclad tearing toward them with growing
speed rammed and sank the foremost
sampan and came back down the line of
her widely scattered adversaries striking
backing and striking again

  it was too much crying that this sea-
monster was the work of gods or demons
but not of men the crews of several ships
hurled their useless weapons into the sea
some fleeing swiftly were fortunate enough
to reach the shore where they beached and
set fire to their vessels to save them from
two strong meil



the victorious koreans but most of them
were slain fighting or fleeing so that the
chroniclers of that day have declared the
sea was red with their blood

  but kurushima did not flee inwardly
raging but steady and skilful as in victory
he took upon himself the honor of japan
handling his own long open boat smartly
he offered his broadside to the enemys
ram swung round as it came on and
brought her right under the overhang of
the ironclads starboard beam with a
joyous yell the men of tosa swarmed up
on the turtles back lusting to flesh their
heavy swords but their fierce cries soon
changed to shrieks of agony for the curved
iron deck was studded thickly with sharp
spikes and spear-heads on which the help-
less boarders were impaled

  kurushima alone was luckier leaping
up at an open port he succeeded in grasp-
ing one of the great gilded fangs in the
lower jaw of the dragons mouth before
his own boat was left behind pulling
himself up with his left hand he took the
sword from between his teeth and delivered
a mighty overhand blow at a dimly seen
form inside the port he had the joy of
feeling his blade shear through flesh and
bone and seeing it come back dripping
then the reloaded gun was run out through
the port the lower lip of its muzzle struck
the daimio squarely on his helmeted fore-
head and knocked him senseless into the sea

kurushimas eyelids fluttered
twice and opened wide he felt
weak and faint his fingers found
the sleeping-mat on which he lay his eyes
saw but did not comprehend the pine-tree
which sheltered him and the six-foot fence
of canvas raised about the tree on spears
thrust upright into the ground for a
time his brain did not grasp the meaning
of these things then memory and under-
standing dawning in his mind he ground
his teeth in humiliated pride

  the savage hopeless battle against the
tortoise-boat the crunch of the monsters
ram against the ribs of his doomed ships
the overwhelming defeat his own desper-
ate futile attempt to snatch victory from
the teeth of destruction and the crashing
blow that had flung him into oblivion-all
came back upon him now with accumulated
bitterness japan had relied upon him
and he had failed her now he lay here

rescued he knew not how cared for by folk
he had not seen but alive alive when he
should have died with his brave sailors

  there was only one course for a beaten
soldier a dishonored samurai with hands
that would scarcely obey the command
of his brain he fumbled for his dagger
fixed in the resolution to commit hari-kari
that he might not live continually reproach-
ing himself for the stain of his defeat

  but at the sound of his first feeble
stirring a little man in a gray kimono
stepped from behind the pine he was
short this man even for a japanese
barely five feet tall and as slightly built
as a child his face was that of an in-
credibly old and wrinkled monkey but
the eyes which burned in it were those of
a god whoso met their glance knew
himself in the presence of his master
kurushima started violently and turned
his face away it was hideyoshi himself
the all-conquering dictator of japan

  reading the daimios intention as he
was wont to read the minds of men hide-
yoshi raised two fingers in a gesture of
restraint

  you shall not slay yourself kuru-
shima he commanded you are to kill
the crew of the tortoise-boat instead and
sink their iron monster in the sea

  but how gasped the astonished kuru-
shima how can i do this when i have
already failed

  by returning to your province of tosa
and playing go in your castle at urado
hideyoshi replied enigmatically and sat
on the floor beside the sleeping-mat do
not try to rise for the fever has scarce left
you it is a fortnight since you were
brought here one of your sailors kept
you afloat in spite of all your armor and
drew you to a piece of floating wreckage
whence you were taken into the ship of
miyosi of izumo that is how you were
saved and this is how you may serve
japan

  we must have a great strong ship
carrying heavy guns to sink the tortoise-
boat otherwise the war can not go forward
we build no such vessels of our own i
have tried to buy two from the portuguese
in macao but they will not sell only one
other source remains

  every year at this time or a little later
a huge ship like a castle in the sea sails
northward past the coast of tosa this


adventure

ship comes from manila richly laden and
goes to another spanish city called aca-
pulco the spaniards in manila have
many such vessels but their king fearing
lest they grow too rich lets them send only
one a year five years ago a tempest
drove one of those spanish ships into your
port of urado

  kurushima nodded his despair forgotten
in eager attention

  she tarried for a week he affirmed
filling her water-casks and waiting for the
wind to moderate for it was a very great
storm

  this years ship said hideyoshi
tapping his finger-tips together to em-
phasize his words will come to urado
whether there is a storm or not

  kurushima was too polite to look in-
credulous but the dictator sensed his
doubts and thought it best to dispel
them

  there are many japanese in manila
and they tell me much hideyoshi ex-
plained graciously one of them a chris-
tian named ichio sails with this years
ship her course from manila lies through
many islands where the christian priests
and their converts wait for her coming
and row out to her bearing gifts of fresh
meat and fruit to certain ones of these
converts on the nearer islands i have
already sent orders which they will repeat
to ichio when the ship arrives

  now ichio is keeper of the water-casks
aboard her off the coast of tosa he will
report quite truthfully to his captain
that the casks are leaky and nearly empty
and he will praise the spring that flows
under the wisterias above your beach
the ships captain will have no choice but
to put into urado if he would keep his
crew from perishing of thirst

  then you must get possession of the
ship if possible do so without violence
for i do not wish to begin another war
till this one is finished if you give the
spaniards a fair opportunity they may
give up without a struggle the spaniards
in manila are few and fear us greatly
they are merchants loving gain and hating
to fight probably you can bribe the
captain to sell the ship ichio has been
told to study his weaknesses and report
them to you

  remember if it comes to fighting that
the ship is to be captured so far as possible

without injury her crew are of no im-
portance except the sailing-master and
the gunners these you will try to take
alive

  the hulls of these manila ships are of
teak thick enough to withstand stone or
iron shot from the heaviest cannon in all
japan or korea that is why i wish for
one to fight the tortoise-boat if you
succeed you shall take the great ship into
battle for the conquest of china never-
theless stout as she is i forbid you to use
either cannon or fire-arrows when you
capture her lest mischance occur

  we of tosa despise such cowards
tools kurushima answered scornfully
the brave man knows no weapon but the
sword

  with a smile that beautified his wrinkled
face hideyoshi reached within the folds
of his kimono and handed to kurushima
the daimios own beloved blade at the
familiar feel of the sharkskin grip tears
burst from kurushimas eyes and a great
flood of health and strength poured through
his fever-wasted veins

  even the sea-god failed to wrest it
from your grasp said the dictator may
you die with it in your hand

what manner of man then is
this captain of yours demanded
kurushima crisply

  through a loophole in the wall of his
castle he could see the great manila galleon
san gregorio riding at anchor in urado
bay the flaming banner of spain flew
from her lofty poop and beneath it sparkled
the blue gleam of western armor

  ichio the mask-faced secret agent of
hideyoshi looked at the fighting eye and
panther-like body of the daimio-now
fully recovered from the effects of his
fever-and replied-

  oh lord of tosa he is even such a man
as yourself

  what christian dog cried the angry
daimio his eyes flashing terribly do
you compare this barbarian this sea-
merchant with one of the honorable class
of samurai

  forgive my heedless tongue most
mighty lord wailed ichio his forehead
scraping the matting and the back of his
neck tickling with apprehension i mean
that he is no merchant but a warrior-
a caballero which is to say a samurai of
two strong men



spain bom of the most ancient and im-
poverished house of de torres my captain
don diego thinks never of gain but always
of honor the spaniards in his crew boast
of the many battles he has fought with the
english the moros and other pirates so
great is his skill and valor that he has never
lost a ship entrusted to his care and so
wonderful is his honesty that though he
has had charge of whole cargoes of silver
and gold he is still poor

  there can be no question then of
bribing such a man said kurushima with
much satisfaction

  the idea had been utterly repugnant to
his straightforward hard-hitting nature
but hideyoshis commands had been ex-
plicit now however the daimio could
go ahead after his own methods with his
conscience free

  obedient to the dictators will he had
proceeded with the utmost caution no
sooner had the san gregorio entered urado
harbor early that morning than he had
seen to it that certain effective but unob-
trusive methods had been taken to bar
her exit moreover out from the mist-
shrouded shore had darted a dozen chal-
lenging guard-boats crammed with picked
swordsmen ostensibly to demand the reason
for the strangers intrusion had there been
evidence of panic or unpreparedness on
board the galleon she would have been
boarded and captured then and there

  but a culverin had roared from a lower-
deck port and an eighteen-pound solid
shot struck the water so close to the bows
of the leading guard-boat that the column
of spray it raised fell on and drenched the
startled rowers as they instinctively backed
water so there was a halt and a parley
in which ichio served as interpreter and
when as a result of that parley the guard-
boats withdrew and some of the galleons
crew rowed ashore as the sun drank up
the mist to begin the all-day task of filling
the water-casks ichio came with them and
presently slipped away to the castle to
make his report to the daimio

  it is true that don diego can not be
bought with gold he said regretfully
but he has one weakness he is in love

  on the last voyage from acapulco to
manila we had as passenger the lady
ysabel daughter of the governor of the -
philippines never oh lord of tosa have
i seen so beautiful a maiden all on board

worshiped her-the very lascars made
verses in her praise which the lookout sang
as he walked in the bows at night and
from the high poop don diego and the
lady ysabel would look down together at
the moonlight on the sea long before
we reached manila we knew from the way
those two looked at each other that they
were in love

  what have this captains private affairs
to do with me kurushima inquired

  this there is in them a means for
getting this ship into your hands most
mighty one

  go on then the daimio commanded

  when we reached manila the spy
continued we found no fleet of trading-
junks from china as there should have
been with silks and porcelains for the
galleons return voyage to acapulco the
fierce moro pirates from sulu had frightened
them all away great was the clamor of
the manila merchants to the governor
who talked loudly but did nothing it was
a great calamity to all in manila for in the
china trade lies all their wealth and they
live but for the fat profits from the sale
of those goods in acapulco

  as soon as we had discharged our lading
of spanish goods and mexican silver don
diego went to the governor and offered to
sail the san gregorio into the sulu sea
destroy the pirates and re-open the china
trade this was a voluntary service on his
part for he is not an officer of the governor
of the philippines but of the viceroy of
mexico overjoyed the governor bade
him name his own reward and don diego
asked for the hand of the lady ysabel
this was overheard by one of my comrades
a servant in the palacio nothing is said
or done in manila that we servants of japan
do not know

  now there was in manila a cunning
rogue who called himself don feliz de
arruego and who had grown rich by secret
speculation in billetes these billetes are
pieces of paper each entitling its bearer to
ship the fourth part of a bale on the yearly
galleon they are distributed among the
merchants of manila according to the
wealth and standing of the merchant and
their value fluctuates greatly

  what do i know or care of merchants
and their papers interrupted the impa-
tient kurushima what has this to do
with capturing a ship


adventure

  patience oh mighty one and i will
make all clear if anything occurs to
prevent the yearly shipment to acapulco
the billetes decline greatly in value and the
merchants face ruin one day a fisherman
employed by this feliz de arruego came
to manila with a most terrible tale blown
by contrary winds into the sulu sea he
had there so he declared seen the san
gregorio grappled by a whole fleet of proas
and the fierce moros swarming up her sides
by hundreds then so the fisherman
swore the galleons powder-magazine ex-
ploded and she was blown to pieces with
all on board

  at this fearful news all manila was
plunged into the deepest despair there
would be no shipment the billetes were
worthless it was a terrible blow to the
island trade

  deepest of all was the grief of the lady
ysabel many were her tears and many the
masses she had said for the repose of her
lovers soul

  then came another suitor for her hand
don feliz de arruego going to the gov-
ernor he revealed the truth which was
that don diego was alive and returning
victorious in the san gregorio with the
heads of three pirate dattos hanging from
the bowsprit and a rich chinese trading
fleet astern the governor cursed himself
because like all others in manila he had
sold all his billetes when the false news had
made them worthless

  don feliz assured him that there was
none who had not done the same and
revealed himself as the purchaser there-
fore he was now the sole owner of the cargo-
space in this years galleon and was in
consequence made fabulously rich by his
own knavery and the valiant exploits of
his rival in consideration of his wealth
he asked the governor to let him marry the
lady ysabel

  and did not the governor instantly
order him to be crucified demanded the
virtuously indignant kurushima

  no for don feliz offered him a half-
share in the profits it was that or poverty
for the governor who had received by the
san gregorio unexpected orders to return
at once to spain and because he had been
so eager to fight the pirates don diego
had not tarried for a formal public be-
trothal to the lady ysabel without which
he had no guarantee of her fathers good

faith when he came back triumphant to
manila he found her betrothed to don
feliz de arruego

  and now oh lord of tosa they are
all-don diego the governor don feliz
and the lady ysabel-returning to aca-
pulco in the san gregorio out there in your
harbor

  then why exclaimed the daimio
when he has them all on his ship does not
this wronged and valiant captain cut the
two knaves heads off and marry the
maiden

  doubtless he would do so if there were-
any place where he could go afterward
but there is not for he could not return
home and he is too honorable a man to
turn pirate but if he were offered high
rank in your service with his ship oh
ruler of the southern sea why should he
not slay his enemies and accept

you do well to take precautions
captain hidden among those
houses are troops to the strength
of half a ter da

  so spoke pedantic little lieutenant
pablo gomez as he stood on the quarter-
deck of the san gregorio and studied the
beautiful mountain-girt shores of urado
bay without a suspicion of their beauty
he was in command of the handful of time-
expired infantrymen returning to spain on
the galleon and his eye was that of a
trained soldier-and nothing else

  but the tall man beside him was not
looking at the land his eyes were fixed
on five small fishing-junks moored close
together in the fairway just inside the
entrance of the harbor

  i am more concerned don pablo with
those fishermen yonder they have caught
nothing all day yet they remain in the
same spot

  why should those wretched smacks
concern you more than a host of heathen
soldiery asked lieutenant gomez in
wonder

  it would be hard to make you under-
stand why don pablo replied diego de
torres smiling you are a soldier and
i am a seaman

  he was that rarest of sixteenth century
types a spanish naval officer who knew
and loved the sea born in a crumbling
spray-drenched castle on the craggy head-
land where for five centuries his ancestors
two strong men

had looked out over the bay of biscay
don diego had literally learned the taste
of salt water in his cradle the children
of fishermen and smugglers had been his
playmates and later his teachers had been
the buccaneers of holland france and
england in the grim schools of the north
sea and the caribbean

  young as he was he had commanded
a ship in the great armada of  and
had been one of the few commanders to
bring his vessel safely back to spain
he had served with high distinction in
the galleons of the indian guard before the
viceroy of mexico sent him to the southern
seas

   yet in spite of his plebeian knowledge
of sheets and braces cross-staffs and
astrolabes no one could deny that don
diego de torres looked and bore himself
like the caballero he was his slender
shapely figure in its perfectly fitting sheath
of black and silver was as straight and
supple as the long rapier by his side and
as finely tempered his handsome deli-
cately-featured face would have seemed
that of an ineffectual dreamer to one who
failed to notice the strong chin beneath
the short pointed beard or who had never
seen the light of battle glow in those dark
melancholy eyes

   up the poop-ladder from the waist came
a young girl astonishingly beautiful she
was a spanish blonde blue-eyed and fair
as any englishwoman but with all the
grace and lire of the south perched on
her wrist sat a small gay-feathered borneo
parrot which her father the ex-governor
had bought for her on the assurance that
it could play tricks and talk like a chris-
tian

  has it spoken yet dona ysabel
asked lieutenant gomez as he did at least
ten times daily

   not yet don pablo

   a suspicious gleam of polished metal in
one of the temple groves ashore caught the
watchful lieutenants eye the tide was
ebbing and the galleon lay head on to
shore don pablo bowed and went forward
for a closer view

   for the first time since the galleon had
cleared from manila diego and ysabel
were alone together though he had
longed to speak with her to be near her
the caballeros rigid sense of honor had
forced him to maintain a formal distance

between himself and the betrothed of
another man burning with resentment
at the trick that don feliz had played
upon him his heart tortured with hopeless
love he was man and gentleman enough
to play the game as he understood it cost
him what it might but now he was face
to face with ysabel herself the blood
throbbed in his temples his stern face and
tense lips showed the strain under which
his self-control was laboring ysabel
watched him with anxious tender eyes

  suddenly before either of them could
utter a word a strange shrill voice spoke
from the empty air between them

   diego it cried softly and plaintively
as if its heart were breaking diego of my
soul come back to me

  it is the bird said diego his voice
under control but his cheeks white beneath
the sunburn it is the bird-i have heard
the like in the west indies

  ysabel trembled and caught at the poop
rail for support the parrot shaken from
her wrist flew to the top of one of the
great heavily leaded stern lanterns whence
it cried again-

  diego of my soul come back to me
through the open cabin skylight came the
clink of glasses and a snatch of a drinking-
song in a high-pitched unpleasant voice-
the voice of that successful speculator in
billetes don feliz de arruego

  no said ysabel her voice on edge
with loathing her features firm and re-
solved no i will not go back to spain
and marry that beast down there

  diegos heart leaped with a hope that he
dared not acknowledge

  you must not say this he cautioned
her it can do no good

  he knew that her greedy-souled father
would hold her to the bargain as by spanish
law he had every right to do and he knew
that the parrot was repeating what it had
heard her cry out over and over again in
the night watches innocent as she was of
the terrible imitativeness of parrots
henceforth the bird would cry it out all
over the ship-and the voyage to acapulco
was five months long

  the cold sweat was standing out on
diegos forehead but ysabel was smiling
radiant with happiness

   listen diego she cried softly so that
those in the cabin might not hear listen
i have found a way


adventure

  no no he protested i can not
listen-you can not in honor-oh what
can i say to make you understand we
must not think of that which has been-
you are his betrothed

  his betrothed she breathed scorn-
fully her eyes twin points of blue flame
his purchase together with the bales of
spices in the hold let him keep ship and
merchandise-you and i will go ashore in this
strange land and live there forevermore
ysabel you would stay in japan a
hostile and a heathen land you would
spend your life among barbarians to be
with me

  but there are thousands of christians
in japan so ichio of the water-casks has
told me the girl replied and good
priests from portugal who- her voice
sank to a whisper but she finished bravely
with crimson cheeks-who would marry
us diego

  her lovely eyes looked up into his her
face was very near here on this same
corner of the poop where they now stood
he had first spoken to her one moonlit
night in mid-pacific of his great love
that love had filled his heart ever since
mastering him with its sweet madness
torturing him with its hopelessness and now
he felt it rise within him in a great glad flood
that swept away all doubts all scruples

  why should he give her up she was
his his in spite of the vile trickster who
had stolen her from him but who had not
won her heart she loved him diego
loved him enough to give up home friends
riches and live in exile so she might only
live with him and why not why
should they not land on that beautiful
shore before him and there live happily as
long as life was theirs he bent toward her
beside himself with her beauty and
stretched out his arms to take her to him

  but before he could put his thought into
word or action a loud challenging hail rang
out from the forecastle

  boat ahoy keep off or we fire
diegos arms dropped to his side the
madness swept from his brain by the
urgency of duty he turned to look out
over the rail a gorgeously painted barge
crowded with japanese officials in strange
ceremonial costumes had put out from the
shore and was approaching the anchored
galleon

  but it is the honorable ambassadors of

the lord kurushima came the reply in
spanish and in the familiar voice of ichio
with a most weighty message to the
valiant captain don diego de torres

  bid the ambassadors come aboard
diego replied shortly

  his half-hostile reception when he entered
the harbor the massing of troops on shore
and the semi-piratical reputation of the
tosa coast had caused him to stand on
his guard and keep off all shore craft at a
safe distance he had wanted nothing
better than to be left alone till he could
complete the tedious task of refilling the
water-casks and put out to sea

  but a formal embassy demanded formal
and proper reception-even if he were not
now thinking of making a welcome in
japan for himself and ysabel

  lower away the starboard gangway
smartly there diego commanded
boatswain lay aft with your sideboys
drummers and trumpeters lieutenant
gomez your musketeers and pikemen will
form a guard of honor have them present
arms as the ambassadors come overside

  loud boomed the saluting guns the
trumpets sounded the drummers beat a
ruffle and the boatswain piped the am-
bassadors aboard there were bows and
greetings on both sides the ambassadors
all men well past middle life with gor-
geously embroidered silk kimonos and oiled
black top-knots almost swept the decks
with their foreheads and the courteous
spaniards drew off their plumed caps with
a stately flourish and a crooking of velvet
knees

  beautiful gifts of curiously carved ivory
were brought forward by the ambassadors
boxes of perfumed sandalwood inlaid
bronze-lacquer caskets and rich pieces of
raw silk were presented in token of the
friendly esteem of the daimio in ac-
knowledgment diego had his servants
bring out food and tall glasses of spanish
wine of which his guests partook sparingly
he offered no gifts in return for he knew
that would have offended the ambassadors

  ichio maestro de los factories de agua
proved himself also a master of the lan-
guage and etiquette of both nations after
an hours hard work he reached the point
where he could deliver the daimios urgent
invitation to captain diego de torres to
visit him in his castle and advise him how
to combat the terrible tortoise-boat
two strong men



   diegos somber eyes lit up with interest
here was the very opening he was looking
for moreover the description of the
strange korean warship which had in-
flicted disaster upon the fleet of japan
aroused his professional interest so diego
went ashore with the highly pleased and
very deferential ambassadors by his own
orders none of his countrymen went with
him he wanted no witnesses to that which
might occur

cs kurushimas castle proved to
r be a huge rectangular enclosure of
  gray stone hardly more than a
crenelated wall twelve feet high sloping
outward in a massive escarpment and pro-
vided with wide strong gates and a moat
passing through ihe south gate with his
escort between two fantastically-armored
sentinels in black war-masks diego was
ushered in between bowing functionaries
and discovered himself in a court containing
half-a-dozen picturesque wooden buildings
richly finished and grotesquely carved
his guides led the way into the largest of
these and departed

  a powerfully built man with command-
ing eyes rose from a padded mat at the
further end of the hall and approached him
bowing low though no word was said
diego recognized that he was in the pres-
ence of the daimio so obviously was this
japanese the master of the place ichio
entering behind his captain confirmed his
impression by prostrating himself with
marked humility diego looked his host
over with frank though courteous curiosity
kurushima was still young plainly an
athlete and a soldier his gaze was lion-
like and frank his gestures those of a born
leader of men

   after tea had been brought in and served
with much ceremony in handleless cups
of gay chinese porcelain the daimio
began to talk easily and fluently ichio
translating with a mounting air of impor-
tance diego listened intently without
comment as calmly as if he had been
discussing an event of ancient history
kurushima told the tale of the tortoise-
boat describing his own defeat in vivid
concise terms

  and this is the ship he concluded at
length drawing a roll of stiffened silk from
one capacious sleeve

  seated upon a chest-the nearest ap-

proach to a chair in all urado-don diego
received the roll unfolded it and gazed
with great interest at a spirited painting
of the tortoise-boat drawn by kurushima
from memory the daimio was an artist
of no mean ability and had reproduced
every detail of the monstrous craft with
wonderful accuracy

  a new type-a galley with broadside
guns as well as bow-chasers exclaimed
the spaniard in that point it resembles
the galleasses of don john of austria at
lepanto-but those were no true galleys
for they were ship-rigged as well as oared
i should like to see a squadron of these
tortoise-boats built for the mediterranean
service and sent against the rovers of the
barbary coast

  this curved deck don diego is covered
with plates of iron explained ichio
the lord kurushima wishes to know if you
have ever heard of an iron-plated ship
before

  diego nodded

  when i was at the siege of antwerp the
hollanders sent against our blockading
fleet a large galleon whose sides they had
covered over even to her cage-works with
plates of iron they expected great things
from this craft and named her the finis
belli which signifies in latin the end of
the war but she steered badly ran
aground on a shoal heeled over at low
tide till she was helpless and so was cap-
tured by the ship which i then had the
honor to command

   swiftly ichio translated this into japan-
ese and presently put the daimios next
question into spanish

  since you have captured one iron ship
don diego could you not capture another
could you fight the tortoise-boat with a
galleon like the san gregorio

  yes in the open sea galleys are good
only in sheltered waters with her over-
hanging topsides and narrow hull this
tortoise-boat would roll vilely in any sort
of sea so that good gunnery would be
impossible her iron sheathing can not
be more than quarter-inch plate other-
wise its weight carried so high above the
water-line would capsize and sink her even
in a calm the san gregorios culverins
would smash her thin plating like glass
how much does a galleon like the san
gregorio cost

  she was built at the cavite shipyards


adventure

three years ago for eight thousand pesos
her guns and tackle cost as much more
diego replied

  the honorable daimio would buy her
for sixty thousand pesos-more than three
times what she was worth new said
ichio

  i shall forward his excellencys most
liberal offer to the viceroy at mexico city
diego assured them wondering where the
japanese could find a captain capable of
commanding a western war-galleon

  and to you oh don diego continued
the interpreter he offers lands worth ten
thousand koku a year and the fair castle
of kobugara to you and to your heirs
forever if you will stay and be his admiral

  diegos face was unmoved but his heart
bounded within him here was the chance
he had been hoping for which he might
even have been moved to suggest himself
had not the japanese played into his hand
it was a princely offer should he accept
it then he could go back to the san gregorio
with a light heart and return to shore with
dona ysabel her father and don feliz
would doubtless object but what could
they do he himself was free to resign
from the service of philip of spain and
gil robles the mate was fully competent
to take the galleon back across the pacific

  moreover from the moment he had en-
tered the hall and looked into the daimios
frank young face and fearless eye diego
had felt himself strongly attracted to
kurushima friendships had been few
in diegos lonely life here he knew in-
stinctively was a man who would make
him a strong and loyal friend unknown
to diego the same thought was in kuru-
shimas mind as he sat on the cushioned
mat and looked at his outland guest
shrewd little ichio glanced from one to
the other read their minds and silently
congratulated himself and his master
hideyoshi

  tell the lord kurushima that i accept
said diego rising for his service seems
one in which a man may gain much honor
now i must go to the ship and come back
with a friend before the galleon resumes
her voyage to acapulco when she has
returned to japan as my lord kurushimas
ship then will i begin my duties as his
admiral till then i crave his hospitality
for myself and one other person now on
board the san gregorio

  oh don diego ichio entreated his
excellency wishes that you and whoever
you may bring with you may be his guests
for ten thousand years but he says that
he can not wait for the galleon to cross the
great ocean and return he must have
her now to sink the tortoise-boat as soon
as possible that japans armies may cross
the seas delay might mean the ruin of
our enterprise the honorable daimio
must take possession of the san gregorio
today

diego tapped his foot upon the
floor

  that he answered calmly he
can not do i regret exceedingly tbat i
am unable to dispose of his majestys ship
without authorization

  but don diego protested the voluble
ichio the crew will do whatever you bid
them-you have but to order them ashore
none of those on board will be injured or
deprived of anything the cargo will be
placed under seal and guarded by its owners
and the soldiers of lieutenant gomez till
another ship can come from manila to
take everything away and the great price
that the lord kurushima is paying for the
ship will surely compensate for the delay
to those in authority in mexico and spain
diego knit his brows polite as the
daimios assurances were he felt a veiled
threat under their silkiness the japanese
needed his vessel now evidently they would
not brook delay yet his honor would not
permit him an officer of the king to be
false to his trust no matter what it might
cost himself and that it might cost much
he knew for he was familiar with the repu-
tation of the japanese

  and with that thought came realization
the quiet but evident purpose of those
fishing-smacks-the gleam of armor in
the temple - groves the guard-boats
crammed with swordsmen he understood
it all now the daimio would not wait for
a reply from spain if he could not get the
san gregorio peacefully he would try what
force could do diegos stubborn heart
hardened and his reply was crisp

  be that as it may he said firmly i
can not do this thing his excellency asks
of me for i am not yet in the service of the
lord kurushima i am until he is pleased
to accept my resignation an officer of his
most catholic majesty the king of spain
two strong men



and until the sale of the galleon has been
consummated the san gregorio is still the
kings ship which i who have the honor to
command her will defend against any who-
soever will try to take her by force of arms
you will make this clear to the lord kuru-
shima and add that i have the honor to
wish him a very good afternoon

  and with a courtly bow he turned and
walked out of the audience hall looking as
unconcerned as if he were taking a stroll
on the prado inwardly he was suffering
all the tortures of the inquisition before
him rose the white pleading face of ysabel
doomed by his quixotic action to a hateful
marriage sacrificed to a pedantic point of
honor but however willing he might be
to stay with her in japan he could not steal
the kings ship and what was her happi-
ness or his compared to the honor of
spain holding his head high diego
passed on

  but when he came to the outer courtyard
of the castle he found the gateway barred
by a score of japanese pikemen with
lowered points other men-at-arms
guarded the stone steps leading to the
platform where in time of siege archers
could stand to shoot over the battlemented
parapet of the castle wall

  out of the door of the audience hall came
kurushima attended by ichio and an
armed guard

  the daimio regrets oh don diego
cried the interpreter that he must detain
you here till he has seized the san gregorio
and he hopes that you may yet become
his admiral and serve him as faithfully as
you have served the king of spain

  tell the daimio answered diego
looking swiftly about him that since he
is coming to visit my ship i must hasten
aboard to prepare a welcome for him

  against the wall hard by the castle gate
stood a wooden rack full of long stout
bamboo lances before any of the sur-
prised japanese could stop him diego
had reached the rack and snatched out
one of the fourteen-foot spears bringing
it to the charge he ran full-tilt across the
gravel not in the direction of the gate
but toward a long blank stretch of the
outer wall just as the spear-head seemed
about to crash against the granite diego
lowered and thrust itinto the ground at the
foot of the wall

  the butt of the shaft with the man

clinging to it rose straight up into the air
letting go of the lance diego dropped
on his side on the broad platform of the
wall rose and dived headforemost through
an embrasure into the deep waters of the
castle moat

   a startled shout half rage half acclama-
tion went up from the astounded japanese
in the courtyard a mounted retainer on
the road outside reined up his horse at
the sound and at the sight of a dripping
foreigner climbing out of the moat beside
him the horseman made the mistake of
drawing up too close just as he snatched
out his sword diego was upon him put-
ting one hand under the red-lacquered
shoe-like stirrup the athletic spaniard
gave a great heave that lifted the other
out of the saddle and dropped him half-
stunned and wholly bewildered into the
middle of the road before the retainer
could scramble to his feet again diego had
mounted and was galloping down the road
to the shore

  behind him armed men were pouring in
shouting hundreds out of the castle gate
drums began to beat conches sounded
hoarsely from both the thatch-roofed
town on diegos right and the huge old
buddhist temple on his left erupted sudden
streams of men-at-arms a matchlock
roared a flight of arrows whirred past
the fugitives head but the range was long
and the target far from stationary bare-
legged peasants toiling in the wet paddy-
fields looked up curiously at the hunted
horseman but made no attempt to stay
him farming was their trade fighting
their masters

  now the beach was very near drawn
up on the sand like a viking fleet were
twenty or more great open row-boats
ready to be manned and pushed off diego
thought of the flint and steel in his pouch
but there was no time to try burning the
enemys boats-the pursuers were too
close straight down the beach and into
the water he rode the panting pony till
the saddle was awash

  saint james be praised cried diego
fervently

  halfway between him and the anchored
galleon was the san gregorios long-boat
with a giants rosary of fresh-filled water-
casks bobbing astern

 ho gil robles to me

   standing up in his stirrups diego shouted


adventure

and waved his broad-brimmed felt hat
with its dripping plume the stocky
figure in the stern of the long-boat looked
round waved back whipped out a gleam-
ing knife and cut the tow-rope

  even so we have filled enough casks
today to last us to the rain-belt of the
upper latitudes thought diego as he
threw away his hat and dived from the
saddle good man gil

  round came the long-boat starboard
oars backing port oars pulling in a smother
of foam and a crackling roar of biscayan
oaths from the mate diego swam swiftly
out to meet it his long rapier hampered
him cruelly but he would not part with it
he swam under water as much as possible
coming to the surface only for a hastily-
snatched breath and diving again for fear
of arrows from the shore

  but no arrows fell looking back as he
swam diego saw the beach a solid mass
of excited japanese soldiery and in the
front rank archers lowering their bent
bows at the imperative gestures of kuru-
shima on horseback and in full armor at
the waters edge

  heathen though he is thought the
grateful spaniard there breathes not in
all christendom a more gallant knight and
gentleman than lord kurushima

       thirty strokes more and gil
robles was helping him into the
long-boat away they went for
the san gregorio the boats crew pulling
with every ounce they could throw into it
as they saw the swarming japanese embark
and push off from the shore

  taking a deep breath into his aching
lungs diego stood up in the stern-sheets
and blew a long call on the silver whistle
hung round his neck back shrilled an
answer from the boatswain on the ship the
soldiers trumpeter sounded the call to arms

  men swarmed up the galleons shrouds
and lay out on the yards round creaked
the windlass as the huge hempen anchor-
cable writhed in through the hawse-hole
like a frightened snake foresail and main-
sail huge single topsails-top-gallants and
royals there were none-the little square
spritsail under the high-steeved bowsprit
and the tall graceful lateen on the mizzen-
all were set and the anchor apeak as the
long-boat shot round the san gregorios
bows and along her starboard side

  now the off-shore breeze brought her
head round and her port battery to bear
on the approaching japanese flotilla

  let them have it shouted diego as
he came over the rail

  already loaded and run out the nine
culverins on the gun-deck and the light
pieces on the poop and forecastle thundered
together before the dense cloud of sul-
furous smoke had lifted the galleon was
running with the wind on her starboard
quarter for the open sea

  the saints be praised the heathen are
all slain cried a fat manila silk-dealer with
pious fervor

  two boats sunk one sinking the rest
coming on bravely corrected diego
peering through the lifting powder-smoke
astern how craftily they follow in our
wake-we have not a gun to bear lay
aft the musketeers bid the master-gunner
shift two culverins to the stern-ports
why not round to and give them
another broadside asked gil robles

  i dare not in this narrow channel
betwixt the inner haven and the sea
replied the captain in a low voice should
we touch bottom or the wind fail us before
we reach open water they will lay us
aboard and there are a thousand good
fighting men in those craft while we have
less than three-score fit to bear arms

  gentlemen he added in a louder voice
to the anxiously listening passengers arm
yourselves and report for duty at your
appointed stations be of good cheer for
it may be given us this day to uphold the
honor of spain rig the waist-cloths
there send round-shot up to the tops
and yards make ready the bases minions
and murderer-guns pikemen stand by
the rail carpenter make hot the pitch
lieutenant gomez the after-castle is your
charge senor robles the forecastle is
your station i myself will hold the waist
high-built at stem and stern were the
galleons of those days the forecastle was
indeed a castle set in the fore part of the
ship the poop was another fortress towering
aft the low waist lay like a valley be-
tween them to raise its sides and make
them harder for a foe to scale strips of
stout canvas painted with gay armorial
devices were stretched along the top of the
bulwarks from poop to forecastle these
were the waist-cloths ancestors of the
nineteenth-century boarding-net
two strong men



  mounted at the break of poop and fore-
castle were the bases minions and mur-
derers wicked little breech-loading swivels
that could sweep any part of deck or rail
with a storm of small shot	

  boy bring me my armor cried diego
but the cabin-boy was below sanding the
gun-deck

  then suddenly some one stood by the
captains side placing the helmet tenderly
on his head buckling on his breast and
back plates it was ysabel careless of
who might see

  i failed ashore he whispered it
was my fault forgive me and farewell
her answer prompted perhaps by the
excitement of the moment perhaps by the
certainty of betrayal by the parrot was
to kiss diego squarely on the lips in the
sight of the whole crew-and of don feliz
de arruego passing by her infuriated
betrothed as if he did not exist she went
into the little chapel of saint gregory
that opened off the main cabin and knelt
before the altar where the priests and
friars were praying for deliverance from the
fury of the heathen

  on plunged the galleon at the top of
her ponderous speed the wind was freshen-
ing the ebb-tide ran like a mill-race down
the narrow channel but the long many-
oared craft astern gained steadily urged
by the straining efforts of the rowers till
they were not quite within musket-shot
at that distance they remained holding
their position easily but making no effort
to gain

  i like it not said lieutenant gomez
as diego came up to inspect the defenses
of the poop why do the heathen follow
us so tamely down this defile to the open
where they know we can turn and blow
them to pieces being the swifter why
do they not press the pursuit

  because answered the captain they
have blocked the mouth of the channel
with those fishing-smacks i pointed out to
you

  but there is much room at either end
of their line said the infantry-officer
peering ahead at the little fleet of anchored
junks why not outflank and march
past them on the right or left

  good tactics for a soldier diego com-
mented but this is the sea it is too
shoal we must hold on and run one of
them down

  charge home and trample them under
foot i have never fought on the sea
but i perceive i shall do so under a wise
and valorous general god keep you don
diego

  and you don pablo

  wringing the simple-hearted little sol-
diers hand diego went below to the gun-
deck to train himself the bow-chasers on
the line of anchored junks now nearly
within range there were five of them
lying squarely across the fairway broad-
side on to the approaching galleon nets
were stretched between them but there
was not a sign of life on their decks

  firing a first shot over them to give fair
warning-of which they took no heed-
diego let drive at the bow and stern of the
midmost junk hoping to smash the bitts
and cut her cables but that was too
accurate work for the primitive smooth-
bores on a high-built deep-pitching galleon
down came the junks foremast and a
cloud of splinters flew from her rotten top-
sides that was all

  a worn-out empty hulk said gil
robles as diego came on deck again
with our weight and speed we should
ride right over her

  there was no other way any attempt
to check their own ungainly craft in that
narrow tide-race would have piled her up
on the sands a helpless prey to the wolf-
pack following astern

  hold her steady we are on her

  with a great crash of splintering timbers
the bluff bows of the san gregorio crushed
through the frail hull of the fishing-junk
snapping her ribs and deck-beams like the
veins of a dried leaf then the incredible
happened instead of sinking or breaking
in two the shattered distorted wreck
wrapped itself round the destroyers fore-
foot staying her progress bringing her
inside of ten seconds from full speed to a
dead standstill

  the strain on the san gregorios fabric
was terrific-no modern wind-jammer could
have suffered it without losing most of
her top-hamper but the manila-acapulco
galleons had small sail area teak masts and
massive rigging of pure abaca fiber
though every inch of her shrieked in
protest nothing carried away

  her plight however was hideously ob-
vious the wrecked junk plastered round
her bows was held together and made fast


adventure

by thick grass hawsers to her four consorts
and each of the five was double-anchored
bow and stern the galleons impact had
bent the line of junks causing the two
nearest the wreck to drag their anchors
till the japanese craft were close up under
the san gregorios forecastle one on either
side

  clear away that wreckage cut the
cables

gil robles and a dozen seamen
swarmed down over the bows
knife and hatchet in hand but
before they could sever a single strand
there erupted from the holds of the four
uninjured junks a shrieking horde of naked
brown men brandishing naked steel those
that were near enough leaped down with
high-heaved blades others dived over-
board and swam round to the wreck
holding their swords in their teeth

  gil robles split the first comers skull
with his hatchet but the odds were too
great three of the galleons crew were
literally chopped to pieces there on the
wreck fighting furiously the mate and
the rest of his detail made good their
retreat up over the bows while the heathen
hacked at them from below at last they
were once more sheltered by the high
square-built forecastle here they turned
on their pursuers and hurled the foremost
foemen down into the sea

  send forward the musketeers implored
gil robles swinging his dripping hatchet
swivels and musketeers

  but a roar of musketry from the poop
told him the soldiers were busy aft well
they might be the japanese flotilla
astern was closing in on the trapped galleon
as-fast as oars could drive it trapped she
was but not defenseless-the san gregorios
stern-chasers loaded with a solid-shot and
a bag of bullets each smashed one crowded
rowboat and made fearful havoc aboard
three more	

  well done master-gunner shouted
diego down the main-hatch cease firing
run in and secure your guns-the boats
will be too close alongside to hit before you
can reload close and make fast the port-
shutters then on deck all

  a savage yell of triumph burst from the
throats of the bloodthirsty swordsmen
aboard the two leading japanese craft
one to port and one to starboard they

swept up and made fast alongside the san
gregorios waist the eager warriors on
board them took no heed of the galleons
topmen who having furled and stowed the
fore and mainsails lay out on the lower
yards yet ready to the hands of those
topmen lurked death and destruction
knives flashed through lanyards and a
great iron cannon-ball dropped like a
thunderbolt from aloft on each boat be-
neath smashing huge holes through the
bottom-boards few were the men-at-
arms of the first two boat-loads that did
not go down with their shattered trans-
ports

  those japanese that had the chance to
leap for the galleons main-chains and the
luck to get a hand-hold pulled themselves
up pluckily and bravely tried to scramble
aboard but at each tell-tale inward bulge
of the baffling waist-cloths a spanish pike
or sword-point would lunge through canvas
and flesh together

  arrows tore through the galleons rigging
a big negro on the main-yard fell screaming
into the sea a gaily-feathered shaft stick-
ing out from between his shoulder-blades
back scrambled his mates to the shelter of
the round high-walled fighting-tops their
trick had worked well but it could be
worked but once the rest of the japanese
flotilla had now come up its archers loosing
swiftly its eager swordsmen ready to
board

  the spanish musket-balls splintered their
gunwales and tore through their armor
inflicting horrible tearing wounds but in
spite of it the sampans grappled the san
gregorio fore and aft port and starboard
as many as could crowd alongside the
rest vomited their swordsmen over the side
and into the already packed hulls of those
that were at close grips trained to scale
walls and surmount all obstacles the
gallant samurai burdened as they were
with armor swarmed up the sides of the
galleon as easily as the naked men from
the junks

  their keen swords slashed away the
waist-cloths now sodden with blood and
stuck full of arrows only point or ball
told against them no cutlas edge could
shear through their strange loose-meshed
mail of lacquered steel

  eight times the japanese won a footing
on the deck amidships eight times the
murderer-guns from poop or forecastle
two strong men



tore through the dense mass of them
gashing shattering till the fearless boarders
reeled their ranks decimated eight times
diego led a handful of weary pikemen
in a charge that drove the survivors back
into the sea his splendid spirit which
had trained and inspired the motley crew
of the san gregorio-which was more of an
armed passenger ship than a man-of-war-
urged them on now to do more than their
best to face and hurl back professional
warriors

  but no sooner was one boarding party
swept away than a fresh onslaught rolled
up over the rail it was like fighting the
waves of the sea hundreds of the japan-
ese remained and the defenders were now
very few half those that had held the
waist lay dead or desperately wounded on
the deck mingling their blood with that
of their fallen foes and ever the heavy
two-handed oriental swords sheared
through the plates of their dripping armor
and now from the forecastle came a de-
spairing cry

  more men gasped gil robles more
men

  glancing swiftly about to count his
depleted forces diego caught sight of a
gorgeous over-armored figure slinking away
toward the shelter of the cabin

  don feliz he cried roughly back
to your post what your blade is as
clean as it was yesterday here by me
you dog and show yourself a man or by
the saints i will kill you with my own
hand

  the speculator turned toward him a face
gray with terror the flashing japanese
swords had frightened from arruego all
the little manhood he possessed his
diseased imagination pictured those great
razor-edged blades shearing through his
shrinking flesh but the captains eyes
filled him with a fear more imminent more
terrible than the fear of the shouting black-
masked japanese he staggered over to
diegos side his rapier trembling in his
hand

  senor capitdn reported a musketeer
saluting with a powder-blackened hand
lieutenant gomez bids me say that he
can not hold the poop without reenforce-
ments thrice have the heathen scaled
the quarter-gallery and nigh forced their
way in through the stern-windows of the
cabin



  then we must ply them with the
murderer-guns thought diego and beck-
oned the master-gunner to him shift
two swivels to the after-rail and two others
to the forecastle-head he commanded

  but the old master-gunner made a sign
of negation

  they are all too hot to be shifted or
reloaded either the last chamber we
managed to wedge home exploded with the
heat of the breech before i could touch fire
to it unless you can hold them off with
point and edge you must strike or sound a
parley

  never replied diego i will fight
to the end and then order you to blow up
the magazine	i

  and i will obey answered the master-
gunner steadily but there are only two
barrels of powder left

  then listen said the captain and
i will tell you what to do with them the
scheme is desperate but we have no other
hope	

oh lord of tosa protested
kurushimas gray-haired second in
command half our men are slain
the rest are weary and sorely wounded
and this devil-ship is as strong as ever
whenever we win her deck and drive back
her crew their high-placed guns sweep us
away as an angry chess-player sweeps the
pieces from the board their weapons are
too powerful their captain whose sword
is everywhere is no mortal but a demon-
else how could he have flown over our
castle-wall let us give up and row back
to the shore this is worse than the
tortoise-boat

  let dogs and cowards pull for the shore
cried kurushima let the true samurai
follow me

  without waiting to see if any followed
the daimio sprang from the stern of his
own disabled boat to that of another half-
full of blood-tinged water whose bow
touched the san gregorios waist pulling
himself up by the channels he climbed to
the gunwale and stood there slashing away
the tattered waist-cloths till he could look
down upon the deck

  before him stood a spaniard a sallow
effeminate-looking man with cunning shifty
eyes and livid face whose splendid milanese
breastplate cuishes and morion showed
no mark of battle don feliz de arruego
i

adventure

the successful speculator in billetes had
been equally successful in keeping himself
out of harms way till now just after diego
had caught him skulking and ordered him
to the rail and fear of his captain kept
him there though nothing could make him
fight like a man

  but now up rose before him framed in
blood-stained canvas the fearsome figure
of a japanese warrior whose loose-fitting
armor made his crouching body seem mon-
strously misshapen beneath the crested
helmet his face was twisted into a hideous
war-mask from which his eyes black and
gleaming shot terror into arruegos craven
soul forgetting that he held a sword in
his own hand the poor wretch did the
most dangerous thing possible he turned
his back and fled

  like a wildcat kurushima sprang after
him from the top of the five-foot bulwark
and as he sprang he raised his two-handed
sword on high and brought it down with
all his weight and strength on the others
helmeted head through steel and scalp
and skull the keen-edged blade shore its
way till the cloven morion fell to the deck
in two pieces tottering with hands out-
flung feliz fell dead over the fragments of
his own morion

  wrenching his sword free the daimio
turned to face a seaman who thrust at him
with a pike with three strokes of in-
credible swiftness kurushima parried the
thrust cut the pike-head from its staff and
sent the seamans own head rolling after
it into the scuppers this was too much-
the other spaniards bunched near shrank
back before him and away from the rail
over which more japanese encouraged by
their lords example were clambering in
growing numbers

  oh men of tosa shouted kurushima
the ship is ours

  hold them five minutes rang an
answering voice in spanish hold them
off five minutes and we are free

  and rallying his weary crew diego de
torres leaped forward and crossed swords
with kurushima arch-types of the east-
ern and western warriors of their day the
two engaged in single combat unhindered
by the general melee raging round them
no other spaniard wished to meddle with
the terrible daimio and no japanese
warrior would have presumed to interfere
in a battle-field duel between two chiefs

  diego fighting for time stood on the
defense but kurushima attacked with
desperate speed and fury he did not
know what new and terrible means of
resistance the galleons crew might use at
any moment and he could see his own men
look anxiously up at the silent swivels
even as they fought and ever in kuru-
shimas mind was a vision of the san
gregorio under his own command sinking
the tortoise-boat and freeing the way for
japans armies to march on to endless
conquests the thought that on the out-
come of this combat hung the fate of asia
nerved his every blow

  in all japan few swordsmen were kuru-
shimas equal his strokes sheared through
the stoutest mail his feints were dazzling
his sureness of eye and hand proverbial
with all his tremendous strength and skill
he cut and slashed leaping back and forth
to confuse his opponent now he struck
for diegos head now for his right shoulder
now for his left thigh turning his blade in
mid-stroke till it seemed to fill the air
about him with a shimmering mist

  but wherever it fell the japanese sword
beat and glanced off the parrying blade of
the spanish rapier never was the contact
at such an angle that the edge of the heavy
two-handed weapon could bite into and cut
through the slender ribbon of steel which
always met and turned it the europeans
supple wrist-play gave him a freedom and
length of reach unknown to the samurai
who held his long hilt rigidly with both
hands and ever as diego parried he
studied the strength and weakness of kuru-
shimas strange silk-braided mail designed
to turn the edge-but not the point

  suddenly as kurushima heaved up his
sword for a mighty blow a cold tingling
pang shot through his exposed breast his
stroke stayed in mid-air he glanced down
and saw diegos silver hilt pressed firmly
against his breast-bone the spaniards
arm outstretched behind it with a sharp
pull diego withdrew his rapier a foun-
tain of blood spurted after it the long blade
itself was bloody to the point kurushima
strove to bring down his own sword but
instead he heaved a long sigh and slid in a
crumpled heap to the deck

 at that very moment two mighty
columns of water crested with shattered
bits of wood cordage and human fragments
spouted high into the air from under the
an alaskan to wild geese



galleons bows the roar of a double
explosion followed instantly in obedience
to the captains orders the old master-
gunner and his mates had dropped the last
two barrels of powder fitted with burning
fuses over the bows to blow away the
tangled mass of wreckage and hawsers
that held the ship a prisoner by one of
those rare miracles that sometimes crown
supreme daring the explosion had done its
intended work without damaging the gal-
leon

  the san gregorio her bows heaved high
in the air by the force of the concussion
shivered and brought them down with a
force that snapped the last strands which
bound her urged by wind and tide the
galleon surged ahead out of the mouth of
the channel and into the open sea

  terrified by this fearful phenomenon
and by the fall of their invincible daimio
most of the surviving japanese turned and
threw themselves overside the rest cast
down their weapons and begged for mercy
which was readily granted for the san
gregorio was now too desperately short-
handed to continue the light

  te deum laiidamus sang the priests
and friars in the chapel

  diego kneeling on the crimsoned deck

felt two soft arms steal round his neck
felt a kiss upon his cheek

  i saw it all whispered ysabel brave
man that other is dead too nothing can
keep us apart any more

  nothing diego answered then he
loosed the clinging arms

  he had no thought of prayer of thanks-
giving for victory no thought of his ship
that he had saved little even of the riches
and the love he had won with the lady
ysabel his thoughts were all for his
gallant foe

  he is dying he whispered to the girl
and turned once more to the prostrate
japanese striving desperately to stanch
the wound which he had himself inflicted

  at the touch of diegos hand kuru-
shimas body stiffened his eyes opened his
right arm instinctively raised itself and the
sword to which his fingers still clung his
undaunted will forced the dying hand to lift
it an inch two inches from the deck

  then as his eyes met and recognized
diegos the battle-light died out of the
daimios face and a smile of friendship
shone faintly in its stead the tired right
hand relaxed its grip on the hilt the
sword fell clanging on the deck the soul
of the samurai had passed

    past forests that now stand without a leaf

                    with weird and mournful cry from dizzy height
                    like spirits damned and groaning in their grief

                    in wedge formation marked against the sky
                    their southward way with cautious speed they take
                    so following their leader on they fly

    while winters warnings follow in their wake

                     they know no rigors of the frost and cold

                     far to the south they seek the sun-kissed seas

                     on never-freezing streams their wings they fold
                     or rest on limpid lake in balmy breeze

berkeley california

  irondads breech-loading artillery and japanese
spies in manila may seem a bit anachronistic in a
story of the sixteenth century but all three of those
things were contemporaries of william shakespeare
and henry of navarre the korean tortoise-
boat and the dutch armored galleon are described
exactly as set down in history both as to appear-
ance and actions there is an excellent picture and
description of the early breech-loadrng swivel on
page  vol  of the encyclopedia britannica
in the article on ordnance and manila was
never worse plagued with japanese spies and the
fear of nippon than it was in the last decade of the
sixteenth century

japan had not yet become the hermit king-
dom on the contrary it was sending forth its
adventurers to every comer of the far east and even
across the pacific the conquest of korea was but
the first step in the ambitious plans of the great
hideyoshi when the tortoise-boat taught japan a
lesson in sea-power which it remembered in 
and - if the portuguese had been willing
to sell hideyoshi those two war-galleons he had
tried to buy from them a few years earlier there is
no telling what the history of the far east would
have been

  our having hideyoshi try to capture a manila-
acapulco galleon is fiction but in  the gal-
leon san felipe was wrecked and plundered in the
japanese port of hurado and six years later the
espiritu santo was attacked there and fought her
way out through a japanese flotilla her captain

collowing our camp-fire custom
t nichols with his first story in our
magazine stands up and introduces himself

  there arc many kinds of adventure but of them
all life is the greatest the most fascinating grim
uncertain

tooking back over my own life i am startled
by the planlessness aimlessness changefulness
of it it appears to be a series of haphazard events
that only by a magic trick of fate has been re-
deemed woven into a harmonious whole it has
been adventurous more so perhaps than the ma-
jority of lives adventure was bred in me born
by one of the prettiest of norwegian fjords where
every knoll was a monument to some ancient hero
where every name was an echo of battle-blasts and
songs of swords i received as a legitimate heritage
the roving spirit of the vikings

  the intensest recollections of my childhood are
memories of adventure and dreams of adventure
clearly i recall the long winter evenings on the
farm when i sat on fathers knee listening to tales of
his adventures on sea and land in many countries
and climes they were exciting breathless ad-
ventures possible only under the more primitive con-
ditions of half a century ago each tale was a tonic
to my imagination stimulated my mind to fantastic
activities at night before going to sleep i in-
vented the most gorgeous careers for myself i was
not many inches tall when i had irrevocably de-
cided to leave home when i grew big

tater when i was old enough to consider it
childish and effeminate to sit on my fathers
knee other factors nursed my imagination and
adventurous spirit there were for instance the
docks of the nearby seaport with their ceaseless
activities and the men-of-war english german
and french that each summer dropped anchor
with much booming of guns in the roadstead
nothing could be more entrancing to a boy than
these martial vessels or the crews with their gay
irresponsible ways and incomprehensible strangely
musical speech often of a sunday morning my
two brothers and i trudged the eight miles to town
to marvel at them at times the sailors would
take us aboard in their steam-launches and we
explored the ships from keel to bridge an en-
chanted fairyland they were with their gleaming
torpedoes intricate quick-firers immense turrets
and great sleek guns that seemed alive seemed to
long for something to destroy

hphen there was school of course first public
school located about three miles from my
home and later high school in the city the latter
was a private afternoon school and caused me much
inconvenience as i continued to live at home i
had to go by railroad in to town every day at noon
and at night because of a conflict between the
schedule and my classes i was obliged to wait until
eleven oclock for a train arriving at my station half
an hour later and then after walking three miles
along lonely roads i could finally sit down to my
supper and go to bed

t was not yet seventeen years old when i left
 home one february evening i remember
vividly the train-ride the dark desolate docks and
the shadowy background of the city asleep on the
hillside with a starless clouded sky overhead
then followed a two-day journey down the coast
inside a chain of bleak rocky islands forming a ram-
part against the ocean then a trip across the north
sea in the steerage in a storm a page of dantes
inferno then england wonderfully interesting
and eleven days on the ocean then america and a
train-ride into the heart of the country

rut this sketch of my life is becoming too long

    some day perhaps i shall write a fuller ac-
count but here i can only hint at the happenings of
the years that followed i was a boy alone in a
strange country with only a smattering of the
language a hounding sense of my own uselessness
unimportance and thousands of miles from home
there were years of restlessness of grim adventure
doing odd work in odd places searching for a posi-
tion in the order of things half of the states in the
union are associated with memories in my mind
whenever i hear mentioned nicaragua guatemala
costa rica panama recollections arc brought up
talk of the sea and sailing and i can relate personal
experiences

   but throughout these first aimless years one pur-
pose was my constant companion to master the
english language it seemed a hopeless task but
was too fascinating to be let alone it was an
adventure in itself the hunting through books for
new words jotting them down and getting their
meaning whenever a dictionary was within reach

   in spite of their harshness however those years
were kind i became acquainted with life gained a
greater knowledge of myself and out of the chaos
of my mind grew definite aims which in later less
outwardly exciting years i have tried to realize i
have had a few hard lessons and i hope i have
profited by them life owes me nothing out-
weighing all disappointments failures is the gift
the grant of a tomorrow

defore i close this confidential but necessarily
rambling talk with you the readers of the
camp-fire i wish to mention my work i am
new in the fiction field but in the future i hope to
devote all my time and energy to it i do not in-
tend to write stories because the work is easy it
isnt i wish to write because i wish to justify my
existence to give something of myself to the world
to you and i want to please you if i can i want
you to like me you are necessary to me and you
may be assured i shall never try to impose upon
you whenever you see my name at the head of a
story i want you to say this story may not be


adventure

great but it represents the best effort of a man
who has had his tussle with life just as i have and
therefore there must be something worth while in it

as for the story of mine appearing in this num-
ber i have little to say it must speak for
itself doubtless it has many faults but it was the
best i could do at the time i trust i shall do better
in the future i trust i shall always do better in the
future accept this first story then not as a fin-
ished solitary product but as a promise of a
beginning-t nichols

txecember thirteenth i received a
 letter from our comrade and member
of our writers brigade major w robert
foran written in india september thir-
teenth in reply to a letter written by me
june thirteenth-the three being written
three months apart to the day and all on
the thirteenth glad im not super-
stitious and the hoodoo seems not to have
settled on him either for he reports himself
fit with nothing to kick about except heat
heres more good luck to him

early in the winter came a letter
from canuck which ive been
unable to give until now but which is as
interesting and to the point now as it was
then

ottawa can

   am back again after four months in the north
ive had a wonderful time in the last north of
northwestern quebec seen some grand game areas
directed probably the finest film of live game
moose in action etc yet obtained am tanned
like one of my indians and feeling tuned to a
winters hibernation

t have followed with considerable interest your
camp-fire talks on what all americans owe
the united states and can only say im with you
in all youve expressed-just as youve said it
the snake of treason-an ugly word but the only
one that fits unfortunately-must be scotched and
done with absolutely no compunction call them
what you will-pro-germans or anything else-
theyre all anti-americans and their sub-rosa activi-
ties to be squelched must have radical application
of the national knife

   the british including the canadian have always
been prone to allowing too much rope to treasonable
citizens and others calling themselves such of this
country and of the british isles just in the same
way is the ordinary american as i know him
similarly unbelieving in his stand that its nothing
but smoke as i know the foreign element
whether the ignorant immigrant or the educated
resident while you can understand an out-and-
outer it is strange but true that many who should
know better who are actual citizens of the united
states having sworn allegiance to it renouncing
their former allegiance to any and all other states
or republics are the ones who at present have
been and still are getting away with un-american
actions

as i see it applicable to canada and to the
united states to great britain to france
italy or any of the other nations fighting in this
war of democracy against the right of might every
one is either heart and soul for his own country
and its allies or else he is an enemy if the latter
why in the name of common sense is he not
promptly taken directly into the states hands
and treated as an enemy must be

   cutting out newspapers and publications in
any language other than the national one is a
primary essential over here in canada the
danger of permitting any other is seen in french
quebec where rabid anti-british anti-french
anti-canadian anti-conscription all are prevalent
and all are fed and inflamed by the nationalist
french press we have over here much anti-ally
underground work that will never be successfully
disposed of with gloves-s e sangster

tt is seldom that one of our woman
members joins our writers brigade
but lotta adele gannett with a story in
this issue does so and in accordance with
camp-fire custom rises and introduces
herself i know she will be warmly wel-
comed

   i never quite get used to the fact that so
many women read adventure yet it is
not strange after all a woman does not
necessarily prefer soft love-stories forever
and forever we all know plenty of women
whose chief interests do not lie in that direc-
tion and it is natural that they too should
like to turn to stories dealing more largely
with other emotions than those of sex

  also there are plenty of women who
though they like clean love-stories do not
care for the kind whose interest is depen-
dent chiefly upon the physical aspects of sex
we keep our magazine as clean and whole-
some as we can we want the kind of
reader who likes to look upon the world as it
is but prefers not to look at it through sex
spectacles that tinge everything in the
world with one color the kind of reader who
cares most for the big clean fresh-air
things of life a magazine generally gets
the kind of reader it aims for and of course
there is nothing strange in there being many
women who like exactly what our type of
man likes the women members of our
camp-fire can be sure that they get from
their men comrades exactly the kind of wel-
come they want from us a frank clean
man to man fellowship

chicago 

   there is so little ive done that im afraid it
will not be at all interesting i was bom of poor
but respectful parents in the little old state of
new jersey-one of a large family who saw to it
that i did not develop much conceit i was bora
the camp-fire	

in june married in june and my boy was bom in
june the last-named event taking place while i was
still well within my teens the second after id
entered my teens by a very few years indeed i
dont know why i married so young unless some one
whispered in my ear that men were getting scarce
so that now i have a boy who says he is big enough
to eat pie off my head

t took a business course after my marriage
when reverses came and finished the course in
three months and three weeks have two records
on the typewriter-nobody gave them to me i
took them myself one is erratic touch and the
other is the discovery of the greatest number of
new ways to make mistakes every day  might
possibly do better work on the machine if i could
bring myself down to less of a hurry in doing
things but-there is so much to do and be seen in
this little old world and ive barely touched the edges

tvii been from ocean to ocean dipped in one and
rode on the other love colorado and am
going to camp out in its mountains before im many
years older i started to write five years ago-did
three stories the first year three or four the next
and about the same the next for two years ive been
working at it fairly regularly for me

  i came to chicago seven years ago weighing
one-hundred and thirty-three pounds-and look at
me now dam it im american to the backbone
and beyond dad served three years in the civil
war entering when he was sixteen and two mater-
nal uncles served one being killed in battle so im
not a bit neutral now-nor was i before we entered
this war and my greatest hope is that it doesnt
end till the kaiser is licked

  i think i shall remain at thirty-five years old-
permanently and  love to laugh

as i told you the incident on the atlantic
city pier in my story when jim came into
his own was taken from an actual occurrence
the man who did it is six feet four and weighs two
hundred and forty pounds and when the little event
was finished the only thing to show that hed been at
all deeply interested was that his cigar lay at his
feet bitten in two he nearly converted me to
spiritualism-or something-for he is the only per-
son i ever knew who could materialize out of thin
air ill take a vow that ive been on the street
and no one in sight for two blocks in four directions
and in an instant he has stood beside me looking
about like billy penn on the philadelphia city hall

  heres hoping to our acquaintance being freely
and long continued-lotta adele gannett

word from our comrade harry c
winters now convalescent from hos-
pital from england tommy need not
worry our boys will like the canadians
come across with the deeds hes asking for
hold up your end tommy and our boys
will hold up theirs youve too many
deeds behind you to let yourself get worried
by other peoples words and i hope
comrade winters australian knows that
one of americas-and canadas-national

games is kidding and that when you play
that game you dont let it worry you
also comrade dont forget that the aus-
tralians rank as high as talkers as they do
as blamed good fighters nevertheless
your advice is sound and doubtless needed
stick together of course live clean
you bet its necessary

alnwick england

  evidently my last two letters miscarried prob-
ably strafed by u-boats left hospital and am
now in the running again expecting to go back
to the front shortly im glad uncle sam has
taken a hand it should expedite matters the
first contingent got a very warm welcome the
people rose to the occasion seem men of fine
physique if they are as good as they look should
give a good account of themselves

ne thing id warn the boys of is this dont
blow the horn too loud tommy is rather a
queer chap and doesnt like to be told by new
arrivals that they have come to finish the war

of course its only the - fool youngsters that

do so what tommy wants is deeds not words
let the men prove worthy by their actions and
hell find in thomas a friend to tie to who wont
let him down

  the boys have a high standard to live up to
personally from my knowledge of the american
i know he can and will live up to it but these few
words of advice from one who has had three years
of it may not come amiss if we are to win the
campaign it behooves us to stick together live
clean you know what i mean by that and
above all dont talk too much act

qld fritz is a hard man to beat and has put
up a dashing fight and hes not beat yet
please god before next spring well have him where
we want him these peace cranks want discour-
aging when we have peace we want one on a solid
and lasting basis and fritz will not have the dic-
tating of the terms best respects to the boys and
tell them that though perhaps unable to answer
would certainly enjoy a line from some of them
incidentally also a little durham or some sweet
chewing plug would come in handy-pvte harry
c winters  n f s command depot
alnwick northumberland england

	i hose of you on the front land or sea
ought to know how much the rest of
us are interested in your letters drop us
a line we know the censor limits you
but there is plenty left to say and we surely
want to hear from you write to the camp-
fire and reach lots of friends at once

t y the time this reaches you the third
-l liberty loan will probably be calling
you answer the call buy bonds

  i say this to you not as blind unreasoning
patriots but as thinking men and i practise
what i preach
adventure

  every minute of the war america needs
our support when the administration
makes mistakes america needs our support
all the more if the administration asks
less of some other citizens than it does of us
that does not free us from our obligation in
full we set up this administration to
lead and command us it stands now for
our country we may not like it or ap-
prove it but we owe it our loyalty and
support

loyalty to america divides sharply

j into two duties our first duty at
any minute is loyal support of whatever
administration is at that minute in power
unquestioning obedience to whatever laws
are at that minute in force our second
duty to america is to see to it that what-
ever administration we have chosen for
her does its duty as fully as we should do
ours sees and corrects its mistakes when
possible sees and removes its incompetents
always these two things constitute pa-
triotism loyalty to america to the people
but the second duty must wait upon the
first we have no right to point out the
mistakes of the administration if we
ourselves have made the mistake of fail-
ing to support that administration as it
stands

  america needs money now buy liberty
bonds dont just complain in advance
about how the administration is going to
use that money you have no right to
any voice in that until you have done your
part and furnished some of that money
your duty now is to buy bonds

we know that much of our money
must go to remedy the results of
the administrations stubborn or stupid
refusal to prepare in advance for the war
that trying to do in months what should
have been done in years means the loss of
much extra money time and effort without
any extra returns but that colossal blun-
der of the administrations can not now
be undone we must not make a blunder
ourselves by not doing the best we can now
buy bonds after that see to it that as
many as possible of the administration
who were responsible for the tragic blunder
of unpreparedness are forced from office
or at least never again entrusted with public
office in america but while they are in
office support them buy bonds

through the investigation by con-
gress we begin to know who are the
incompetents responsible for national mis-
takes and delays our duty is to insist
that power be taken from the hands of
incompetents we know for example
if the head of the ordnance bureau is
incompetent that not only should he be
removed but that his incompetency argues
the incompetency of secretary baker who
retained him either knowing his incom-
petency or else so ignorant of the condition
of one of the most important bureaus of his
department that he did not know of the
incompetency of its chief his direct sub-
ordinate for whom he is responsible sec-
retary bakers incompetency seems suf-
ficiently established in other ways a
pacifist secretary of war who for three
years refused to prepare at all because the
war was three thousand miles away is bad
enough but a secretary of war who after
nearly a year of american participation is
still three thousand miles away from the
war and three million miles away from any
real comprehension of its needs is too lim-
ited mentally for the countrys fate to rest
so largely in his small hand if you are
convinced of the incompetency of officials
it is your duty to call for their removal but
that is only your second duty to america
your first duty is to do your own part well
and fully buy bonds

we know that congress and the
administration have not equally dis-
tributed the financial burden of the war
there are those who believe there should be
no excess profits from war or other industries
when most of us are losing by the war not
profiting from it in the present upheaval
of economic conditions with practical ac-
complishment dependent so largely upon
individual effort and stimulus an eighty per
cent tax as in england would seem wiser
and productive of quicker better and big-
ger results but not less than eighty per
cent most of us believe that the hundreds
of millions of such profits already made
should be the first money spent for liberty
bonds since what earned them is so large
a part of what the war is waged to pro-
tect it is our second duty to america
to force congress and the administration
to distribute the cost of the war more fairly
and justly but it is our first duty to
support the distribution as it stands
the camp-fire



  we know that politics and party have
sometimes been put before patriotism and
country our crisis calls for a leadership
drawn from the whole people not chiefly
from one political party from the brains
and energies of the whole country not half
of it it is our second duty to demand a
coalition government but first we must
guarantee our own full energies and support
buy bonds

we know that after two years and a
half of warning followed by nearly
a year actually in the war great america
the richest country in the world with a
population of a hundred millions is now
contributing to the war much money and
moral support some brains a navy smaller
than it should be and at this writing in jan-
uary an army almost the size of englands
casualty lists for six or nine months we
know that great america is not able to meet
the vital demand of the crisis for merchant
ships-which even a neutral and pacifist
country is free to build-and that at the end
of a whole year our contribution of ships is
still chiefly plans and provision for the future
we know that great america was so un-
prepared and so incompetent in the actual
test that she is not even yet able to equip
the comparatively small army she has put
into the field and has had to borrow from
her allies what they needed for themselves
we know now that william jennings bryan
by his glib and silver-tongued prediction
that a million men would spring to arms
between sunrise and sunset has written
himself down as the ass of history we
begin to feel now the whole long bitter
tragic proof of the blunder of unprepared-
ness it is our duty to see to it that so
long as other nations carry arms the
advocates of unpreparedness do not again
bring us to the brink of catastrophe but
we must think of past unpreparedness now
only as a warning for the future the
damage will be repaired so far as it can be
repaired not by complaint but by work
loyalty support buy bonds

t efore our troops go into their first big
battle they have begun to pay the toll
of eleventh-hour preparation following
three years of unpreparedness but they
who have died for unpreparedness are
for a later reckoning they have no bear-
ing on our present duty to america our

present duty continues to be one thing-to
do our part now

  buy bonds buy all you can afford
and afford all you can by cutting out things
you do not need buy bonds but do
not stop there by this time each of us
knows what is asked of him the ways in
which he can help win the war you know
your duty do it in all things and the
foremost of these things is support and
loyalty to our administration good or bad
so long as it remains our administration
and to each man in it so long as he remains
a part of it for the administration stands
for america

i know that in speaking thus frankly
i shall bring down upon myself from a
certain type of american the charge of
being unpatriotic another of the admin-
istrations mistakes has been the building
up of the idea that any criticism of itself
is disloyalty purely destructive criticism
of it is disloyalty at least in its effect but
neither honest constructive criticism nor
a frank facing of the facts is unpatriotic
in the eyes of any one but fools

  any man or institution that denies the
right of constructive criticism is un-ameri-
can and undemocratic only a fool or a
traitor withholds one jot of his loyalty
because of mistakes that can not be reme-
died but only an utter idiot or a more subtle
and dangerous traitor calls it patriotism
to allow a present mistake to go uncorrected
or fails to take steps against future mistakes

  we are at war and war is facts a war
has never yet been won with mistakes
or by incompetents or with excuses if
we are to win this war we can not listen to
excuses we can not leave mistakes unreme-
died we can not retain incompetents

it is truth and frankness we need
tell the truth and win the war we
want the facts not the camouflaged facts
whitewash is not war claims are not
accomplishments sugar-coating does not
destroy the bitter pill within we have
guts enough for facts but not stomach
enough for sweetened infant-food let us
have a mans diet

  what disciple of fear and untruth can
openly maintain that the american people
will not fight better and make themselves
better able to fight if they know the full
need and danger war makes necessary


adventures free services and addresses

the suppression of information that will
aid the enemy if he doesnt know it already
but war also makes necessary the giving
out of information whose suppression will
aid the enemy

t will make no appeal to any mans
patriotism if the only kind of patriotism
i am allowed to invoke is the kind that has
neither eyes or ears or brains and if any
one finds disloyalty in what i have stated
i call attention to the fact that it is exactly
the same kind of disloyalty that from
the summer of  to date has been
fighting for national preparedness while

certain other very good americans were
too proud to fight and too pacifically
asleep to do more than watch waitfully
behind the barn door until the horse had
been stolen

  my platform now is very simple first
lets all turn to and try to catch the horse
second lets see that the barn door isnt left
open again

  in other words let us do our immediate
duty immediately buy liberty bonds
after that let us attend to our next duty-
see to it that the liberty bonds are used
to americas best advantage

west african opportunities

  question-will you please tell me something of
the conditions of employment and climate in west
africa i have a chance of getting free passage to
sierra leone and will thank you very much for the
information-wilbur g leekley albuquerque
new mex

  answer by mr miller-your inquiry as to
climate and employment in west africa

  to secure employment write stating your age
schooling and general experience to

  niger company surrey house victoria embank-
ment london lever brothers royal lever build-
ings liverpool england o  f dept work-
ing mostly the congo also the niger the african
association  castle st liverpool england

colonial house water st liverpool african
traders co  drury buildings liverpool benin
river produce co  alexander building ormond
st west liverpool england

  conditions of employment-the above use men
in their small shipyards and machine shops in
africa men to boss the blacks deck officers and
engineers for their river boats agents in charge of
the trading stations a clean-cut young fellow
 to  who can keep simple accounts would not
have much trouble securing work especially if he
turned up at the home office whites do not go

floating around west africa looking for jobs but if
a white did get stranded he would be put to some-
thing by the local agent

  the contract usually calls for three years which
is about as much as a white can stand of the cli-
mate in one jolt the pay is unattractive but most
of the companies board their staffs generously the
life offers individual freedom and if a man works out
well it is usual to grant him a bonus at the end of his
contract

  climate-the climate of west africa is notori-
ous parts of the coasts being known as the white
mans grave malaria canned foods and contribu-
tory causes such as isolation-the sudden cutting
off from newspapers games movies companionship
and the crowding interests of civilization-and the
sun will get most whites in time a few years
of it too unfits one for any home job again one
shrinks from ones fellow creatures or as kipling
says the jungle has them and yet those who have
been there never shake off the romance of the land
and the yearning to hear again the tom-toms of the
mammy dance to live under free skies close
down to the primitive to march at the head of the
long column of blacks under the low-hung stars-
the magic and mystery of the land

  the year is divided into wet and dry seasons
for months the bald cruel sun crawls across steel-
gray skies and one thinks of a cloud and a breath of
wind as of paradise then come the rains an
ask adventure

annual staging of the deluge when the sun becomes
but a memory	  

  health depends largely on temperament and
locality and social conditions - let a young man
with clean ideals find himself cut off from the world
in a sequestered trading station and sub-agent to a
man with whisky bottle and mammy and a
sneer for everything decent and hell go to pieces in
no time

  if you are not self-resourceful-if you have no
hobby nor curiosity in the world you find yourself
in then keep out of west africa to have a hobby-
collect butterflies orchids insects or hunt or delve
into native superstitions and traditions-to keep
cheerfully occupied exercise take a night-cap of

uinine and drink moderately of good light wines
to back up a canned-food dietary and any one can
get through his three years without great reduction
in physical stamina he will be signing on for an-
other three years before his bonus is spent whites
will never colonize in west africa it is the land
of the blacks the whites will go on exploiting
them and the blacks notwithstanding the fond
dreams of missionaries and the pet theories of gov-
ernments will never climb any height out of their
ingrained barbarism

  there are many tribes many dialects some of
the natives are semi-civilized-notably the housa
who are not negroes proper the hinterlands are
fanatically mohammedan there are large pagan
districts where the missionaries of mohammedanism
and christianity compete for converts

        the u s forestry service

  question-i am  years of age would like to
know something of the forest reserve ranger
service of the northwest how an appointment is
secured what the requirements are and any other
useful information- streator 

  answer by mr harriman-the only way to get
a position with the forest service is through taking
a civil service examination at the present time
the service is waiving tests of various kinds such
as recognition of various trees by bark or leaf
packing a mule timber cruising and lumber seal-
ing this is due to the sending of men to france
which has made a shortage of men the pay runs
from si  to si  a year

  the usual examination takes in lumber sealing
timber cruising the recognition of all kinds of trees
by bark leaf and general appearance fire pre-
vention and fire fighting certain knowledge of soils
and of minerals map making surveying riding
rifle and revolver shooting a knowledge of book
and account keeping and various minor matters

  the duties are watching for fires and fighting
them looking after campers to see that they leave
no fires burning arresting violators of rules count-
ing stock grazed on reserves settling boundaries for
grazing timber cruising sales of standing timber
scaling the cut and collecting pay killing predatory
animals helping game wardens acting as general
utility man to the whole reserve inspecting mining
claims to pass on their merits and prevent fraudu-
lent claims being taken up in order to get the tim-
ber watching men who fell timber to prevent use-
less destruction of small trees building new lookout
stations in almost inaccessible places cutting fire-
breaks through brush climbing  feet high to gath-



er pine cones for the seeds propagating trees forre-
stocking denuded areas setting out such new stock
packing water to such stock when set building
bridges running telephone wires etc

  in addition to the duties named the ranger is
always at the beck and call of any settler who is in
trouble my nephew when in the service had to
take an insane woman out one time from  feet
above sea level to a lowland asylum through forty-
five miles of the roughest of mountain roads he
had help of course he and his mate had to carry
a dead woman seven miles on their backs over snow
 feet deep taking turns with the burden he had
to defend himself with a hastily seized club against
the attacks of a man armed with an ax just because
he refused to let the man cheat the government
on a timber deal he had to fight fire thirty-one
days in succession with less than four hours sleep
in every twenty-four

  he had to arbitrate between angry cattlemen
between cattlemen and sheepmen between settlers
and campers he had to ride over  miles in
sixty-one days using two horses he had to help
pack all the materials for a lookout hut up mt
shasta when it was a matter of crawling a good part
of the way clinging to a thousand-foot rope to help
along and then helped build the hut where the wind
blew  miles an hour across a glacier part of
the way they dynamited a trail across the glacier
where the ice lay in ridges ten feet high and from
one to five feet thick with spaces between equal to
ridge

  these few points will give you a faint idea of the
job most of all a man must have nerve and initia-
tive a soft easy-going man is worth nothing
there he must be self-controlled alert able-
bodied quick in mind and body well informed
confident

canoeing through the adirondacks

  question-two friends and myself are going to
take a canoe trip through the adirondacks stopping
at long lake to camp for a while then going to the
st lawrence river near ft covington n y and
home by lake champlain lake george and the
hudson

  will you kindly tell me the best route to take
from albany also the best and lightest equip-
ment-t h rogers yonkers n y

  answer by mr spears-i think perhaps your
best route to indian lake will be up the hudson to
indian river and thence into the lake to your
camping-ground the way the water has been so
far this year you will have ample but it will be up-
stream work of course

  from indian lake i think you would better haul
across to raquette river striking it almost any-
where from blue mt lake to long lake i be-
lieve there are several routes you could take across
from indian lake involving longer or shorter car-
ries over the divide your route would be through
some of the wildest of the adirondacks

  i would prefer two small canoes to one large one
-but that is merely choice it would have advan-
tage in case of a smash-up involving three tourists
have yokes for making carries fit before starting

  the conservation commission albany n y
print adirondack maps which you could obtain i
think through your assemblyman or state senator
the u s geological survey prints topographical
	adventure

survey maps of the adirondack showing contours
elevations and if you write for adirondack index
sheet and get the sheets covering the route of the
river you will have the best maps there are to travel
by paste cheese-cloth on the backs i cut mine
on the black rectangular lines to fold them without
breaking

  as to outfit i enclose a sheet of suggestions
would add that each member could carry a water-
proof blanket woolen blanket and hammock folded
inside the waterproof swing hammocks between
trees and hang waterproof over hammock dry bed
drip in rain will follow the lines down into ham-
mock unless you warp handkerchief around to
switch it to the ground

  dont forget fly dope

going to sea

  question-i am a high-school boy seventeen
years old and would like to have some information
about the sea

  how can a boy work up to become a ships officer
and how long does it usually take what is the
rate of pay for officers- superior wis

  answer by captain dingle-it matters little
how you start going to sea in order to become an
officer but of course you must enter the deck
department of ships

  it is not hard in these days for a young man to
get a job aboard ship men are badly needed-
prospective officers are encouraged supposing
first of all that you are healthy fairly robust and
have good eyesight you can do either of several
things enter one of the big lines as a cadet ship as
boy in any ship-ocean-going for preference-or
enter one of the various branches of the naval
reserve service all this experience will count

  you must serve on deck three years usually
before you are eligible to take the examination for
second mate the knowledge in navigation neces-
sary for this examination must be acquired by your-
self either by study aboard the ship in your own
time or by attending a school ashore between voy-
ages it is by no means difficult a high-school
education is more than most sailors have before
going to sea then when you get the second
mates license and have served one year in that
capacity you can take the first mates exam and
with one years service as first mate the masters
exam is open to you

  you should be at least first mate in four years
but in these war days i think a smart man can
become an officer quicker than the law stipulates
barriers are being lowered in order to secure officers

  pay for officers at present is high third mates
are receiving as much as s per month of course
they are fed well and gratis their lodging is in the
ship free second mates can get up to  and
mates as much as  in the atlantic trade
captains are making huge sums with war bonuses
gratuities etc but after the war you will per-
haps realize these wages can not obtain unless
freights are to remain at their present exorbitant
rates this can hardly be i think since trade can
not stand such charges in any case a steamers
officer is paid well enough to make the profession
attractive and the life is good

  my advice is that you go to your nearest port on
the seacoast and apply in person to the chief mate

or captain of any good-sized ship going anywhere
the chief mate usually engages the men subject to
the skippers approval but for a youngster to start
right he should try to select a fairly good-class
skipper talk to him in person and enlist his inter-
est captains in these times are of a superior
mold to the old-timers at least in education and
breeding though perhaps not better seamen ill
be glad to know how you succeed and am always at
your service	

the canadian northwest

  question-are conditions good in b c or al-
berta for a man who is willing to do any work in
order to live and leam the country i am not
destitute but wish to earn my way while absorbing
what the country has to offer to soothe an itching
foot and an imagination that seeks food for a diary
of adventure- detroit mich

  answer by mr carson-you certainly have the
right idea of how to come to b c or any other place
which is new to you and where the conditions are
different from those in the east since the one way
to obtain information about a country is to live
there a while

  employment of all kinds is to be had almost any-
where out here the larger cities being distributing
points for the districts in which they are situated

  just at present the mills shipyards and logging-
camps arc simply howling for help and the pay is
good the cost of living rather less than it is in the
east while so far as i can leam the relations be-
tween employer and employee are much pleasanter
than almost anywhere else

  by coming now you could leam enough to land a
job with a surveying party or on the reclamation or
forestry service in the spring and for an outdoor
man these jobs are hard to beat the war has
stripped b c of her best men in some instances
whole districts have been practically depopulated
which means just that many openings for the new-
comer these things have to be learned and the
one way to do it is to come and take what you can
get until such time as you can get what you want

  i can not see a single reason why an independent
man should hesitate to come to the coast western
washington being as good a place as any to begin
gathering experience since the condilions here are
almost identical with those across the line and
getting more so every day if there is any particu-
lar brand of labor which you are partial to let me
know what it is and i wifi give you my opinion as
to which would be the best place to locate

lumbering in tennessee

  question-will you kindly give me some in-
formation regarding the lumbering industry in your
district also advise me as to necessary steps i
would have to take to get a position in lumbering
camps	

  i am twenty years old have high-school educa-
tion and two years clerical experience in the
city-frederick c roome new york city

  answer by mr liebe-concerning the lumber-
ing and logging operations in my district they are
being carried on chiefly far back in the hills though
sometimes the logging outfit is in the hills and the
lost

sawmill that uses the logs in a town our lowland
timber in this section is largely cut out

  as to the steps necessary to land a position-it
would be called a job here-about all youd have
to do would be to let some camp or mill know you
wanted work i enclose herewith a late advertise-
ment for men if you go in answer to it dont
dress up stick to flannel shirts and soft hats

  work hard and dont have too much to say until
you get acquainted there are lots of good fellows
among timberjacks but they all have a particular
hankering after fighting you may have to put up
a scrap or two if you do fight like the devil and be
sure you dont use any weapons unless the other
fellow shows a pretty sure sign of using one

  ive given you all this advice because youre only
twenty you are rather young to go into a logging
outfit for a job its a wild rough life

jiu-jitsu

  question-could you give me any information
on the subject of jiu-jitsu as practised in japan
where could i obtain some literature dealing with
the subject

  i have several small pamphlets on it but i dont
think they treal the subject fully-lenore
house ada oklahoma

trails	

  answer by mr ritchie-in the limits of an
ask adventure answer i can not begin to tell you
all there is to know about jiu-jitsu no more than
could the well-known mr james corbett reveal
the science of boxing in anything less than a series
of articles once i started jiu-jitsu under a
licensed instructor in japan when i had taken
lessons for two months he told me-and not before-
that the full course occupied three years i quit
right there

  as you doubtless know already the adept at jiu-
jitsu must possess a knowledge of anatomy almost
as complete as a surgeons and he can kill an ad-
versary by a pinch or the blow of his open palm in
japan therefore nobody is permitted to learn the
science of conquering by yielding except from
responsible and licensed instructors there would
be no room in jiu-jitsu for a battling nelson or
knock-out brown one must have a head for the
game instead of just a punch

  the pamphlets you mention are positively worth-
less i can refer you to two books on the subject
which could be purchased through macmillan com-
pany new york japanese physical training by

h	irving hancock and jiu-jitsu tricks by
k saito better write macmillans asking them
the price and whether they can procure these works
for you if they have not got them in stock
